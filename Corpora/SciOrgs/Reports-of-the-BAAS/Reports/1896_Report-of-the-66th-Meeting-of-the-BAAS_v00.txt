special object of science having been adopted by the Sectional Committee, the
numher of Members of such Committee be then fixed, but that the Members to
serve on such Cmnmittee be nominated and selected by the Sectional Com-

mittee at a subsequent meeting.^

ance they may require.

                     REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

     Report of the Council for the Year 1895-96, presented to the General
             Committee at Liverpool on Wednesday, September 16, 1896.

     The Council have received reports from the General Treasurer during

the past year, and his accounts from July 1, 1895, to June 30, 1896,
which have been audited, will be presented to the General Committee.

     Of the Auditoi's appointed last year. Dr. Ludwig Mend alone was able

to act. Dr. Thorpe was incapacitated by a severe accident, and Mr. J.

Head was in America at the time of the audit. The President therefoi-e
requested Dr. Frankland to act in conjunction with Dr. Mond, which he

consented to do.

     The Council received an invitation from the Committee charged with
the arrangements for celebrating the Jubilee of the appointment of the
Right Hon. Lord Kelvin as Professor of Natural Philosophy in the
University of Glasgow, to appoint two representatives to take part in

the celebration.

     They appointed Sir Douglas Galton, President, and Professor A. "VV.
Riicker, General Treasurer, to be their representatives, and asked them to

--convey to Lord Kelvin the following letter of congratulation :

      BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE.

                                  Burlington House, London, \V.

  To THE Right Honourable LORD KELVIN, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., &c. &c.

   --My Lord, The Council of the British Association for the Advancement of

Science desire to offer to you their sincere congratulations on your attainment of
the fiftieth year of your tenure of the Professorship of Natural Philosophy in the
University of Glasgow.

     It is unnecessary to recount the triumphs you have won during the last lialf-
century in mastering the difficulties which beset the advance of scientific theorj' and
experiment, and in applying scientific principles to the practical service of man.
The record of your achievements is fresh in the minds of those who address you, and
can never be effaced from the history of the development of Mathematical and
Experimental Physics, of Engineering, and of Navigation.

    We would rather, therefore, recall to your recollection the long and close connec-

tion which has existed between the British Association and yourself.
     As a regular attendant at our meetings, you have not only enriched our Trans-

actions with many important papers, but have encouraged the efforts of younger men

by never-failing sympathy and interest in their work.
     You have been President of the Mathematical and Physical Section of the Asso-

ciation no less than five times. You were President of the Association at Edinburgh
in 1871, and are now a Life-Member of our Council.

    As colleagues, then, we wish to tell you of the pride with which we, in common

with all your fellow-countrymen, regard your distinguished career, and of the feelings

of personal attachment with which we express the hope that you may long be spared

to enjoy, in health and strength, the honours you have so nobly won.
                                                    Signed on behalf of the Council,

                                                                      Douglas Galton, President.

     June, 1806.
                  REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                           Ixxxi

     The Council have nominated Mr. T. H. Ismay, J. P., D.L., and Pro-
fessor Archibald Liversidge, F.R.S., Vice-Presidents of the Association;
and Mr. 0. Booth, jun., Assistant Local Treasurer.

     The Council had also nominated as a Vice-President of the Association
Mr. George Holt. They deeply regret the loss which the Association has
sustained by the death of Mr. Holt, one of the most munificent of the

promoters of Science in the City of Liverpool.

    The Council have elected the following Foreign Men of Science Corre-

sponding Members :

Professor Dr. Emil C. Hansen,    Professor Ira Remsen, Baltimore.
   Copenhagen.                   Professor C. Range, Hanover.

Professor F. Paschen, Hanover.

An invitation to hold the Annual Meeting of the Association in 1898

Anat Bristol has been received.  invitation has also been received to

hold the Annual Meeting of the Association at Glasgow in 1898. These

invitations will be presented to the General Committee on Monday.

The Council received a proposal from M. Gariel, Secretary of the

Council of the Association Frangaise pour I'Avancement des Sciences, that

in 1898 or 1899 the French Association should meet at Boulogne, and

our Association at some town on the opposite coast, such as would allow

an interchange of visits between the two Associations. This proposal was

cordially welcomed by the Council, and inquiries were instituted as to the

possibility of a meeting of our Association at Dover, which seemed to be

Athe most suitable town on the English side of the Straits.  favourable

report was received of the accommodation at Dover, and of the welcome

which the Association might expect ; and a reply was sent to M. Gariel

thanking him for his suggestion, and expressing a hope that we should be

able to do our part towards its accomplishment. Since then an invitation

lias been received from the Corporation of Dover to hold our meeting in

1899 in that town. The Council of the French Association, which ordi-

narily meets earlier than ours, wish to settle their place of meeting in

1899 before the date of our meeting at Toronto. It thus becomes expe-

dient for the General Committee to consider the invitation from Dover at

their meeting on Monday next ; and, to enable them to do so, the Council

propose that, in the rule for fixing the place of meeting, the words ' not

less than two years in advance ' be substituted for the words ' two years

in advance.' If this proposal be adopted, the invitation from Dover will

come before the General Committee on Monday next.

The President has received from the Mayor of San Francisco the

following resolution, which had been passed by the Board of Supeiwisors

of that city :

' Resolved that his honour the Mayor be, and is hereby empowered and

requested to invite the American and Australasian Associations for the

Advancement of Science to meet in this city in 1897 ; also, to invite the

British Association of the same character to meet said Associations in

this city as invited guests, and to that end to take such action as may

be proper to arrange for their comfort and accommodation on that

occasion.

' And the clerk is hereby directed to advertise this resolution as

required by law.

' Board of Supervisors, San Francisco, October 28, 1895.'
The President was requested by the Council to inform the Mavnr of

1896.                                                              e
Ixxxii                                                                         --REPORT 1896,

San Francisco that his communication would be laid before the General
Committee at Liverpool.

     Since the above resolution was adopted the Council have been informed
that it has been decided to hold the meeting of the American Association
in 1897 at Detroit. It is not, therefore, possible, to make arrangements
for a joint meeting in San Francisco, or for the Association to visit that

city. It is proposed, therefore, to reply in this sense to the invitation of

the Mayor of San Francisco, and to request him to convey to the Board

of Supervisors the best thanks of the Association for their cordial in-

vitation.

     The Council recommend that on the occasion of the Meeting of the
Association at Toronto, the President, Vice-Presidents, and Officers of
the American Association be invited to attend as Honorary Members for
the year ; and further that all Fellows and Members of the American
Association be admitted Members of the British Association on the same
terms as old Annual Members, namely, on payment of IL, without the
payment of an admission fee.

     The Council recommend that the arrangements made for the Meetings
of the General Committee at Montreal, in 1884, be adopted for the

--Meeting next year viz. : Thai, two Meetings be held at Toronto, and

that an adjourned Meeting be held in London at the beginning of the
month of November, for the election of the President and Officers for
1898, and for fixing the date of the Meeting in that year.

     The Council have received the following communication from the"
Secretary of the Corporation of the McGill University, Montreal :

        To THE President and Members op the Council of the

                                        British Association.

                                                                                               McGill Universit}', Montreal,

                                                                                                                         Janiiari/ 11, 1896.

   --Gentlemen, I have been directed by tlie Corporation of the University to lay

before the Council of the British Association a proposal giving the Faculty of
Applied Science the liberty of substituting for the British Association Gold Medal
one or more Bronze Medals, together with an exhibition or prizes in such cases as
the Faculty might recommend.

     The British Association Gold Medal was generously founded by the members of
the British Association in the year 1885, and, apart from its intrinsic value, the
medal has always been regarded as the highest prize obtainable in the Faculty of
Applied Science.

The desire of the Faculty has been to require a very high standard from those

,who are candidates for the medal. A difficulty has, however, often arisen, owing to

the fact that there are five distinct departments in the Faculty, namely, the

departments of Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering. Mechanical Engineering,

Mining, and Chemistry. The practice has been to award the medal in the several

departments  in  rotation                                                 but  of  course  it  often  happens  that  in  more  than one
                                                                       ;

department there are to be found students worthy of the medal. It has also happened

that the best student is not in the department in which the medal falls in order of

rotation.

     After long consideration, and after the experience of the ten years which have

passed since the foundation of the medal, the Faculty is of the opinion that it would
be advisable to ask the permission of the Council to substitute for the Gold Medal a
B.A. Exhibition, or B.A. Prizes, together with one or more B.A. Bronze Medals. The
Faculty is convinced that the change would rather add to than diminish the value of

the foundation.
REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  Ixxxiu

     The Council informed the Corporation of the McGill University that
they were willing to advise the General Committee to accept the proposed
changes, and they have asked for information as to the number of Prizes
and Bronze Medals which would probably be awarded annually under the

revised regulations.

     The following resolutions referred to the Council by the General
Committee for consideration and action if desirable were dealt with as

follows :

     (1) That the Council be requested to consider whether it be desirable
to take steps in order to bring the following resolution under the notice

of H.M. Government and the Trustees of the British Museum :--

      'That in view of the importance of preserving the remains of the
various civilisations of this Empire which are fast disappearing, and in
order to prevent the loss and dispersion of collections of ancient and

modern Anthropology which may be offered to the nation, it is highly

desirable to acquire less costly and far more extended storehouse space

than can be provided in London.'
     The Council appointed a Committee to report on this resolution, and

were informed that, in accordance with the suggestion made by Mr.
Charles Read, Keeper of Antiquities and Ethnography at the British
Museum, and with the concurrence of Professor Flinders Petrie, the

proposal to establish a Repository for preserving Anthropological or other
objects will be again discussed at the Liverpool Meeting ; and that there-

fore no further action need be taken by the Council at present.
     (2) That the Council be requested to bring before the Government the

importance of securing for the National Collections the type collection of

preparations of Fossil Plants left by the late Professor W. C. Williamson.

     This resolution was communicated by the President, Sir Douglas
Galton, to the Trustees of the British Museum, and the Council ha-^e
been informed that the Collection of Fossils has been purchased by them

for the Museum.
      (3) That it is desirable to reprint collections of the Addresses delivered

by the Presidents of Sections in separate volumes for sale.
     The Council, having considered this proposal, resolved that no action

be taken.
      (i) That the Council be requested to provide the Geological Survey

Maps and Sections of the district in which the Association meets each
year, to be placed in a conspicuous position in the Meeting Room of

Section C.

      The Officers have been empowered to carry out this proposal.
      The Report of the Corresponding Societies Committee for the past
year, consisting of the list of the Corresponding Societies and the titles
of the more important papers, and especially those referring to Local
 Scientific Investigations, published by those Societies during the year

 ending June 1, 1896, has been received.
      The Corresponding Societies Committee, consisting of Mr. Francis

Galton, Professor R. Meldola, Sir Douglas Galton, Sir Rawson Rawson,

      Sesolutions referred to the Council for consideration, and action

                                                       if desirable.

     That the Council be requested to take such steps as they think best to bring
before the Government the question of the establishment of a National Physical
Laboratory in general accordance with the recommendations contained in the Report
appended hereto,* and to invite the co-operation of the Royal Society of London,
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Astronomical Society, the Physical
Society, and other kindred Societies, in securing its foundation.

     That it is of urgent importance to press upon the Government the necessity of
establishing a Bureau of Ethnology for Greater Britain, which, by collecting informa-
tion with regard to the native races within, and on the borders of, the Empire, will
prove of immense value to science and to the Government itself.

SIE JOSEPH LISTEE, Baet., D.C.L., LL.D., P.E.S.,

                                   PRESIDENT.

My Lord Mayor, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I have first to

express my deep sense of gratitude for the great honour conferred upon
me by my election to the high office which I occupy to-day. It came
upon me as a great surprise. The engrossing claims of surgery have
prevented me for many years from attending the meetiflgs of the

Association, which excludes from her sections medicine in all its
branches. This severance of the art of healing from the work of the

Association was right and indeed inevitable. Not that medicine has
little in common with science. The surgeon never performs an operation
without the aid of anatomy and physiology ; and in what is often the
most difficult part of his duty, the selection of the right course to follow,
he, like the physician, is guided by pathology, the science of the nature

of disease, which, though very difficult from the complexity of its subject

matter, has made during the last half-century astonishing progress ; so
that the practice of medicine in every department is becoming more
and more based on science as distinguished from empiricism. I propose
on the present occasion to bring before you some illustrations of the
interdependence of science and the healing art ; and the first that I will
take is perhaps the most astonishing of all results of purely physical

--inquiry the discovery of the Rontgen rays, so called after the man who

first clearly revealed them to the world. Mysterious as they still are,

--there is one of their properties which we can all appreciate their power

of passing through substances opaque to ordinary liglit. There seems to

be no lelation whatever between transparency in the common sense of

                                                                                                                           B2

the term and penetrability to these emanations. The glasses of a pair of

spectacles may arrest them while their wooden and leathern case allows
them to pass almost unchecked. Yet they produce, whether directly or
indirectly, the same eflects as light upon a photographic plate. As a

general rule the denser any object is the greater obstacle does it oppose
to the rays. Hence, as bone is denser than flesh, if the hand or other
part of the body is placed above the sensitive film enclosed in a case of
wood or other light material at a suitable distance from the source of the
rays, while they pass with the utmost facility through the uncovered
parts of the lid of the box and powerfully affect the plate beneath, they
are arrested to a large extent by the bones, so that the plate is little
acted upon in the parts opposite to them, while the portions correspond-
ing to the muscles and other soft parts are influenced in an intermediate
degree. Thus a picture is obtained in which the bones stand out in sharp
relief among the flesh, and anything abnormal in their shape or position

is clearly displayed.

     I need hardly point out what important aid this must give to the

surgeon. As an instance, I may mention a case which occurred in the

practice of Mr. Howard Marsh. He was called to see a severe injury of

the elbow, in which the swelling was so great as to make it impossible for
him by ordinary means of examination to decide whether he had to deal

with a fracture or a dislocation. If it were the latter, a cure would be
efiected by the exercise of violence which would be not only useless but

most injurious if a bone was broken. By the aid of the Rontgen rays a

photograph was taken in which the bone of the upper arm was clearly
seen displaced forwards on those of the forearm. The diagnosis being thus
established, Mr. Marsh proceeded to reduce the dislocation ; and his suc-
cess was proved by another photograph which showed the bones in their

natural relative position.

     The common metals, such as lead, iron, and copper, being still denser
than the osseous structures, these rays can show a bullet embedded in a
bone or a needle lodged about a joint. At the last conversazione of the
Royal Society a picture produced by the new photography displayed

with perfect distinctness through the bony framework of the chest a half-

penny low down in a boy's gullet. It had been there for six months,

causing uneasiness at the pit of the stomach during swallowing ; but
whether the coin really remained impacted, and if so, what was its position,
was entirely uncertain till the Rontgen rays revealed it. Dr. Macintyre

of Glasgow, who was the photographer, informs me that when the presence

of the halfpenny had been thus demonstrated, the surgeon in charge of the
case made an attempt to extract it, and although this was not successful
in its immediate object, it had the eflfect of dislodging the coin ; for a sub-
sequent photograph by Dr. Macintyre not only showed that it had disap-
peared from the gullet, but also, thanks to the wonderful penetrating
power which the rays had acquired in his hands, proved that it had not
ADDRESS,  5

lodged further down in the alimentary passage. The boy has since com-

pletely recovered.

     The Rontgen rays cause certain chemical compounds to fluoresce, and
emit a faint light plainly visible in the dark ; and if they are made to fall
upon a translucent screen impregnated with such a salt, it becomes
beautifully illuminated. If a part of the human body is interposed
between the screen and the source of the rays, the bones and other
structures are thrown in shadow upon it, and thus a diagnosis can be
made without the delay involved in taking a photograph. It was in fact
in this way that Dr. Macintyre first detected the coin in the boy's gullet.
Mr. Herbert Jackson, of King's College, London, early distinguished
himself in this branch of the subject. There is no reason to suppose that
the limits of the capabilities of the rays in this way have yet been reached.

By virtue of the greater density of the heart than the adjacent lungs

with their contained air, the form and dimensions of that organ in the

living body may be displayed on the fluorescent screen, and even its move-

ments have been lately seen by several diflierent observers.

     Such important applications of the new rays to medical practice have

strongly attracted the interest of the public to them, and I venture to
think that they have even served to stimulate the investigations of
physicists. The eminent Professor of Physics in the University CoUege-
of this city (Professor Lodge) was one of the first to make such practical
applications, and I was able to show to the Royal Society at a very early
period a photograph, which he had the kindness to send me, of a bullet
embedded in the hand. His interest in the medical aspect of the subject
remains unabated, and at the same time he has been one of the most dis-

tinguished investigators of its purely physical side.

     There is another way in which the Rontgen rays connect themselves
with physiology, and may possibly influence medicine. It is found that
if the skin is long exposed to their action it becomes very much irritated,

affected with a sort of aggravated sun-burning. This suggests the ideA

that the transmission of the rays through the human body may be not

altogether a matter of indifference to internal organs, but may, by long-
continued action, produce, according to the condition of the part con-

cerned, injurious irritation or salutary stimulation.

     This is the jubilee of Antesthesia in surgery. That priceless blessing
to mankind came from America. It had, indeed, been foreshadowed in

the first year of this century by Sir Humphry Davy, who, having found

a toothache from which he was suffering relieved as he inhaled laughing
gas (nitrous oxide), threw out the suggestion that it might perhaps be
used for preventing pain in surgical operations. But it was not till, on

September 30, 1846, Dr. W. T. G. Morton, of Boston, after a series of

experiments upon himself and the lower animals, extracted a tooth pain-

lessly from a patient whom he had caused to inhale the vapour of sul-
phuric ether, that the idea was fully realised. He soon afterwards publicly
--G REPORT 1896.

exhibited his method at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and after

that event the great discovery spread rapidly over the civilised world. I

witnessed the first operation in England under ether. It was performed by
Robert Liston in University College Hospital, and it was a complete success.
Soon afterwards I saw the same great surgeon amputate the thigh as
painlessly, with less complicated anaesthetic apparatus, by aid of another

agent, chloroform, which was being powerfully advocated as a substitute
for ether by Dr. (afterwards Sir James Y.) Simpson, who also had the

great merit of showing that confinements could be conducted painlessly,
yet safely, under its influence. These two agents still hold the field as

general anesthetics for protracted operations, although the gas originally
suggested by Davy, in consequence of its rapid action and other advan-

tages, has taken their place in short operations, such as tooth extraction.

In the birthplace of  anaesthesia  ether  has always  maintained its ground
                                                                                                                                 ;

but in Europe it was to a large ' extent displaced by chloroform till

recently, when many have returned to ether, under the idea that, though less

myconvenient, it is safer. For     own part, I believe that chloroform, if

carefully administered on right principles, is, on the average, the safer

agent of the two.

    The discovery of anaesthesia inaugurated a new era in surgery. Not
only was the pain of operations abolished, but the serious and sometimes
mortal shock which they occasioned to the system was averted, while the
patient was saved the terrible ordeal of preparing to endure them. At
the same time the field of surgery became widely extended, since many

procedures in themselves desirable, but before impossible from the pro-

tracted agony they would occasion, became matters of routine practice.
Nor have I by any means exhausted the list of the benefits conferred by

this discovery.

     Anaesthesia in surgery has been from first to last a gift of science.

Nitrous oxide, sulphuric ether, and chloroform are all artificial products

of chemistry, their employment as anaesthetics was the result of scientific

investigation, and their administration, far from being, like the giving of
a dose of medicine, a matter of rule of thumb, imperatively demands the
vigilant exercise of physiological and pathological knowledge.

While rendering such signal service to surgery, anaesthetics have

thrown light upon biology generally. It has been found that they exert

their soporific influence not only upon vertebrata, but upon animals so

remote in structure from man as bees and other insects. Even the func-

tions of vegetables are suspended by their agency. They thus aflTord

strong confirmation of the great generalisation that living matter is of
the same essential nature wherever it is met with on this planet, whether
in the animal or vegetable kingdom. Anaesthetics have also, in ways to

which I need not here refer, powerfully promoted the progress of physio-

logy and pathology.

mentation. The prevailing opinion regarding this class of phenomena
when they first engaged his attention was that they were occasioned
primarily by the oxygen of the air acting upon unstable animal or vege-
table products, which, breaking up under its influence, communicated

disturbance to other organic materials in their vicinity, and thus led to
their decomposition. Cagniard-Latour had indeed shown several years

before that yeast consists essentially of the cells of a microscopic fundus
which grows as the sweetwort ferments ; and he had attributed the break-
ing up of the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid to the growth of the

micro-organism. In Germany Schwann, who independently discovered

the yeast plant, had published very striking experiments in support of

analogous ideas regarding the putrefaction of meat. Such views had

also found other advocates, but they had become utterly discredited,

largely tlirough the great authority of Liebig, who bitterly opposed

them.

Pasteur, Iiaving been appointed as a young man Dean of the Faculty

of Sciences in the University of Lille, a town where the products of

alcoholic fermentation were staple articles of manufacture, determined to

study that  process  thoroughly                                                      and  as   a  result  he  became  firmly con-
                                                                                  ;

vinced of the correctness of Cagniard-Latour's views regarding it. In the

case of other fermentations, however, nothing fairly comparable to the

formation of yeast had till then been observed. This was now done by

Pasteur for that fermentation in which sugar is resolved into lactic acid.

This lactic fermentation was at that time brought about by adding some

animal substance, such as fibrin, to a solution of sugar, together with

chalk that should combine with the acid as it was formed. Pasteur saw,
what had never before been noticed, that a fine grey deposit was formed,

differing little in appearance from the decomposing fibrin, but steadily

increasing as the fermentation proceeded. Struck by the analogy pre-

sented by the increasing deposit to the growth of yeast in sweetwort, he

examined it with the microscope, and found it to consist of minute

particles of uniform size. Pasteur was not a biologist, but although these

particles were of extreme minuteness in comparison with the constituents

of the yeast plant, he felt convinced that they were of an analogous

nature, the cells of a tiny microscopic fungus. This he regarded as the

essential ferment, the fibrin or other so-called ferment serving, as he

believed, merely the purpose of supplying to the growing plant certain

chemical ingredients essential to its nutrition not contained in the

sugar. And the correctness of this view he confirmed in a very striking

manner, by doing away with the fibrin or other animal material altogether,

and substituting for it mineral salts containing the requisite chemical

Aelements.  trace of the grey deposit being applied to a solution of

sugar containing these salts in addition to the chalk, a brisker lactic

fermentation ensued than could be procured in the ordinary way.

I have referred to this research in some detail because it illustrates
 8 REPORT 1896.

 Pasteur's acuteness as an observer and his ingenuity in experiment, as

 well as his almost intuitive perception of truth.

    A series of other beautiful investigations followed, clearly proving that

 all true fermentations, including putrefaction, are caused by the growth

 of micro-organisms.

     It was natural that Pasteur should desire to know how the microbes

which he showed to be the essential causes of the various fermentations
took their origin. It was at that period a prevalent notion, even among

many eminent naturalists, that such humble and minute beings originated

de novo in decomposing organic substances ; the doctrine of spontaneous
generation, which had been chased successively from various positions

which it once occupied among creatures visilile to the naked eye, having
taken its last refuge where the objects of study were of such minuteness
that their habits and history were correspondingly difficult to trace.
Here again Pasteur at once saw, as if by instinct, on which side the truth
lay ; and, perceiving its immense importance, he threw himself with ardour
into its demonstration. I may describe briefly one class of experiments

which he performed with this object. He charged a series of narrow-

necked glass flasks with a decoction of yeast, a liquid peculiarly liable to
alteration on exposure to the air. Having boiled the liquid in each flask,
to kill any living germs it might contain, he sealed its neck with a blow-
pipe during ebullition ; after which, the flask being allowed to cool, the
steam within it condensed, leaving a vacuum above the liquid. If, then,
the neck of the flask were broken in any locality, the air at that particular
place would rush in to fill tlie vacuum, carrying with it any living microbes
that might be floating in it. The neck of the flask having been again
sealed, any germs so introduced would in due time manifest their presence

by developing in the clear liquid. When any of such a series of flasks

were opened and re-sealed in an inhabited room, or under the trees of a
forest, multitudes of minute living forms made their apj^earance in them

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but if this was done in a cellar long unused, where the suspended
organisms, like other dust, might be expected to have all fallen to the
ground, the decoction remained perfectly clear and unaltered. The oxygen
and other gaseous constituents of the atmosphere were thus shown to be of
themselves incapable of inducing any organic development in yeast-water.

     Such is a sample of the many well-devised experiments by which he

carried to most minds the conviction that, as he expressed it, ' la genera-
tion spontanee est une cldmere,' and that the humblest and minutest living
organisms can only originate by parentage from beings like themselves.

     Pasteur pointed out the enormous importance of these humble
organisms in the economy of nature. It is by their agency that the dead
bodies of plants and animals are resolved into simpler compounds fitted
for assimilation by new living forms. Without their aid the world would
be, as Pasteur said, encomhre de cadavres. They are essential not only
to our well-being, but to our very existence. Similar microbes must

have discharged the same necessary function of removing refuse and

providing food for successive generations of plants and animals during the

past  periods of  the  world's  history                               and  it is  interesting  to think that
                                                                   ;

organisms as simple as can well be conceived to have existed when life first

appeared upon our globe have, in all probability, propagated the same

lowly but most useful offspring during the ages of geological time.

Pasteur's labours on fermentation have had a very important influence

upon surgery. I have been often asked to speak on my share in this

matter before a public  audience                                 but  I  have  hitherto  refused  to  do  so,
                                                              ;

partly because the details are so entirely technical, but chiefly because I

have felt an invincible repugnance to what might seem to savour of self-

advei-tisement. The latter objection now no longer exists, since advancing

years have indicated that it is right for me to leave to younger men the

mypractice of  dearly loved profession.                                  And it will perhaps be expected

that, if I can make myself intelligible, I should say something upon the

subject on the present occasion.

Nothing was formerly more striking in surgical experience than the

difference in the behaviour of injuries according to whether the skin was

implicated or not. Thus, if the bones of the leg were broken and the
skin remained intact, the surgeon applied the necessary apparatus without
any other anxiety than that of maintaining a good position of the fragments,,
although the internal injury to bones and soft parts might be very severe.
If, on the other hand, a wound of the skin was present communicating

with the broken bones, although the damage might be in other respects
comparatively slight, the compound fracture, as it was termed, was one of
the most dangerous accidents that could happen. Mr. Syme, who was, I

believe, the safest surgeon of his time, once told me that he was inclined to

think that it would be, on the whole, better if all compound fractures of
the leg were subjected to amputation, without any attempt to save the

limb. What was the cause of this astonishing difference ? It was clearly
in some way due to the exposure of the injured parts to the external

world. One obvious effect of such exposure was indicated by the odour of
the discharge, which showed that the blood in the wound had undergone

putrefactive change by which the bland nutrient liquid had been converted

into highly irritating and poisonous substances. I have seen a man with

compound fracture of the leg die within two days of the accident, as

plainly poisoned by the products of putrefaction as if he had taken a fatal
dose of some potent toxic drug.

    An external wound of the soft parts might be healed in one of two

ways. If its surfaces were clean cut and could be brought into accurate

apposition, it might unite rapidly and painlessly ' by the first intention.'
This, however, was exceptional. Too often the surgeon's efforts to obtain
primary union were frustrated : the wound inflamed and the retentive

stitches had to be removed, allowing it to gape ; and then, as if it had

been left open from the first, healing had to be effected in the other way
10 REPORT-- 1896.

Anwhich it is necessary for me briefly to describe.  exposed raw surface

became covered in the first instance with a layer of clotted blood or

certain of its constituents, which invariably putrefied ; and the irritation

of the sensitive tissues by the putrid products appeared to me to account

sufiiciently for the inflammation which always occurred in and around an

open wound during the three or four days which elapsed before what were

termed ' granulations ' had been produced. These constituted a coarsely

granular coating of very imperfect or embryonic structure, destitute of

sensory nerves and prone to throw off' matter or pus, rather than absorb,

as freshly divided tissues do, the products of putrefaction. The granula-

tions thus formed a beautiful living plaster, which protected the sensitive

parts beneath from irritation, and the system generally from poisoning

and consequent febrile disturbance. The granulations had other useful

properties of which I may mention their tendency to shrink as they grew,

thus gradually reducing the dimensions of the sore. Meanwhile, another

cause of its diminution was in operation. The cells of the epidermis or

scarf-skin of the cutaneous margins were perpetually producing a crop of

young cells of similar nature, which gradually spread over the granulations

till they covered them entirely, and a comjjlete cicatrix or scar was the

result. Such was the other mode of healing, that by granulation and

cicatrisation ; a process which, when it proceeded unchecked to its
completion, commanded our profound admiration. It was, however, essen-

tially tedious compared with primary union, while, as we have seen, it

was always preceded by more or less inflammation and fever, sometimes

very serious in their eff"ects. It was also liable to unforeseen interruptions.

The sore might become larger instead of smaller, cicatrisation giving place

to ulceration in one of its various forms, or even to the frightful destruction

of tissue which, from the circumstance that it was most frequently met

with in hospitals, was termed hospital gangrene. Other serious and often

fatal complications might arise, which the surgeon could only regard as

untoward accidents and over which he had no efiicient control.

It will be readily understood from the above description that the

inflammation which so often frustrated the surgeon's endeavours after

primary union was in my opinion essentially due to decomposition of

blood within the wound.

    These and many other considerations had long impressed me with the
greatness of the evil of putrefaction in surgery. I had done my best to

mitigate it by scrupulous ordinary cleanliness and the use of various

deodorant lotions. But to prevent it altogether appeared hopeless while

we believed with Liebig that its primary cause was the atmospheric

oxygen which, in accordance with the researches of Graham, could not

fail to be perpetually diffused through the porous dressings which

were used to absorb the blood discharged from the wound. But when

Pasteur had shown that putrefaction was a fermentation caused by the

growth of microbes, and that these could not arise de novo in the
ADDRESS.  11

decomposable substance, the problem assumed a more hopeful aspect. If
the wound could be treated with some substance which, without doing too

serious mischief to the human tissues, would kill the microbes already con-
tained in it and prevent the future access of others in the living state,

putrefaction might he prevented, however freely the air with its oxygen
might enter. I had heard of carbolic acid as having a remarkable

deodorising effect upon sewage, and having obtained from my colleague

Dr. Anderson, Professor of Chemistry in the University of Glasgow, a
sample which he had of this product, then little more than a chemical
curiosity in Scotland, I determined to try it in compound fractures.
Applying it undiluted to the wound, with an arrangement for its
occasional renewal, I had tlie joy of seeing these formidable injuries follow
the same safe and tranquil course as simple fractures, in which the skin
remains unbroken.

    At the same time we had the intense interest of observing in open
wounds what had previously been hidden from human view, the manner

in which subcutaneous injuries are repaired. Of special interest was the
process by which portions of tissue killed by the violence of the accident
were disposed of, as contrasted with what had till then been invariably
witnessed. Dead parts had been always seen to be gradually separated
from the living by an inflammatory process and thrown off as sloughs.
But when protected by the antiseptic dressing from becoming putrid and
therefore irritating, a structure deprived of its life caused no disturbance
in its vicinity ; and, on the contrary, being of a nutritious nature, it served
as pabulum for the growing elements of the neighbouring living structures,
and these became in due time entirely substituted for it. Even dead bone
was seen to be thus replaced by living osseous tissue.

      This suggested the idea of using threads of dead animal structures for
tying blood-vessels ; and this was realised by means of catgut, which is

made from the intestine of the sheep. If deprived of living microbes, and

otherwise properly prepared, catgut answers its purpose completely ; the
knot holding securely, while the ligature around the vessel becomes

gradually absorbed and replaced by a ring of living tissue. The threads,
instead of being left long as before, could now be cut short, and the

tedious process of separation of the ligature, with its attendant serious
danger of bleeding, was avoided.

     Undiluted carbolic acid is a powerful caustic ; and although it might
be employed in compound fracture, where some loss of tissue was of little
moment in comparison with the tremendous danger to be averted, it was
altogether unsuitable for wounds made by the surgeon. It soon appeared,
however, that the acid would answer the purpose aimed at, though used
in diluted forms devoid of caustic action, and therefore applicable to
operative surgery. According to our then existing knowledge, two essen-
tial points had to be aimed at : to conduct the operation so that on its
completion the wound should contain no living microbes, and to apply a
12 REPORT-- 1896.

dressing capable of preventing the access of other living organisms till
the time should have arrived for changing it.

     Carbolic acid lent itself well to both these objects. Our experience
with this agent brought out what was, I believe, a new principle in

--phai-macology namely, that the energy of action of any substance upon

the human tissues depends not only upon the proportion in which it is

contained in the material used as a vehicle for its administration, but also
upon the degree of tenacity with which it is held by its solvent. "Water
dissolves carbolic acid sparingly and holds it extremely lightly, leaving it
free to act energetically on other things for which it has greater affinity,
while various organic substances absorb it greedily and hold it tenaciously.

Hence its watery solution seemed admirably suited for a detergent lotion
to be used for destroying any microbes that might fall upon the wound
during the operation, and for purifying the surrounding skin and also the
surgeon's hands and instruments. For the last-named purpose it had the
further advantage that it did not act on steel.

     For an external dressing the watery solution was not adapted, as it
soon lost the acid it contained, and was irritating while it lasted. For
this purpose some organic substances were found to answer well. Large
proportions of the acid could be blended with them in so bland a form as
to be unirritating ; and such mixtures, while pei'petually giving off
enough of the volatile salt to prevent organic development in the dis-
charges that flowed past them, served as a reliable store of the antiseptic
for days together.

     The appliances which I first used for carrying out the antiseptic prin-
ciple were both rude and needlessly complicated. The years that have
since passed have witnessed great improvements in both respects. Of
the vai-ious materials which have been employed by myself and others,

and their modes of application, I need say nothing except to express my

belief, as a matter of long experience, that carbolic acid, by virtue of its
powerful affinity for the epidermis and oily matters associated with it,
and also its great penetrating power, is still the best agent at our dis-
posal for purifying the skin around the wound. But I must say a
few words regarding a most important simplification of our procedure.
Pasteur, as we have seen, had shown that the air of every inhabited
room teems with microbes ; and for a long time I employed various more

or less elaborate precautions against the living atmospheric dust, not

doubting that, as all wounds except the few which healed completely by
the first intention, underwent putrefactive fermentation, the blood must
be a peculiarly favourable soil for the growth of putrefactive microbes.
But I afterwards learnt that such was by no means the case. I had
performed many experiments in confirmation of Pasteur's germ theory,
not indeed in order to satisfy myself of its truth, but in the hope of
convincing others. I had observed that uncontaminated milk, which
would remain unaltered for an indefinite time if protected from dust,
ADDRESS.  13

was made to teem with microbes of different kinds by a very brief
exposure to the atmosphere, and that the same effect was produced by
the addition of a drop of ordinary water. But when I came to experi-
ment with blood drawn with antiseptic precautions into sterilised vessels,

I saw to my surprise that it might remain free from microbes in spite of

similar access of air or treatment with water. I even found that if very
putrid blood was largely diluted with sterilised water, so as to diffuse
its microbes widely and wash them of their acrid products, a drop of
such dilution added to pure blood might leave it unchanged for days at
the temperature of the body, although a trace of the septic liquid undi-

luted caused intense putrefaction within twenty-four hours. Hence I
was led to conclude that it was the grosser forms of septic mischief,
rather than microbes in the attenuated condition in which they existed

in the atmosphere, that we had to dread in surgical practice. And at

the London Medical Congress in 1881, I hinted, when describing the
experiments I have alluded to, that it might turn out possible to disre-
gard altogether the atmospheric dust. But greatly as I should have

rejoiced at such a simplification of our procedure, if justifiable, I did not

then venture to test it in practice. I knew that with the safeguards which

we then employed I could ensure the safety of my patients, and I did not

dare to imperil it by relaxing them. There is one golden rule for all
experiments upon our fellow-men. Let the thing tried be that which,
according to our best judgment, is the most likely to promote the welfare

of the patient. In other words, Do as you would be done by.

     Nine years later, however, at the Berlin Congress in 1890, I was able
to bring forward what was, I believe, absolute demonstration of the harm-

lessness of the atmospheric dust in surgical operations. This conclusion

has been justified by subsequent experience : the irritation of the wound
by antiseptic irrigation and washing may therefore now be avoided, and

nature left quite undisturbed to carry out her best methods of repair,

while the surgeon may conduct his operations as simply as in former days,

provided always that, deeply impressed with the tremendous importance
of his object, and inspiring the same conviction in all his assistants, he
vigilantly maintains from first to last, with a care that, once learnt,
becomes instinctive, but for the want of which nothing else can compen-
sate, the use of the simple means which will suffice to exclude from the

wound the coarser forms of septic impurity.
     Even our earlier and ruder methods of carrying out the antiseptic

principle soon produced a wonderful change in my surgical wards in the

Glasgow Royal Infirmary, which, from being some of the most unhealthy

in the kingdom, became, as I believe I may say without exaggeration, the

healthiest in the world ; while other wards, separated from mine only by
a passage a few feet broad, where former modes of treatment were for a while
continued, retained their former insalubrity. This result, I need hardly

remark, was not in any degree due to special skill on my part, but simply
14 EEPOKT-- 1896.

to the strenuous endeavour to carry out strictly what seemed to me a prin-

ciple of supreme importance.
     Equally striking changes were afterwards witnessed in other institu-

tions. Of these I may give one example. In the great Allgemeines

Krankenhaus of Munich, hospital gangrene had become more and more
rife from year to year, till at length the frightful condition was reached
that 80 per cent, of all wounds became affected by it. It is only just to
the memory of Professor von Nussbaum, then the head of that establish-
ment, to say that he had done his utmost to check this frightful scourge

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and that the evil was not caused by anything peculiar in his management
was shown by the fact that in a private hospital under his care there was
no unusual unhealthiness. The larger institution seemed to have become
hopelessly infected, and the city authorities were contemplating its demo-
lition and reconstruction. Under these circumstances. Professor von
Nussbaum despatched his chief assistant, Dr. Lindpaintner, to Edinburgh,
where I at that time occupied the chair of clinical surgery, to learn the

details of the antiseptic system as we then practised it. He remained

until he had entirely mastered them, and after his return all the cases

were on a certain day dressed on our plan. From that day forward not
a single case of hospital gangrene occurred in the Krankenhaus. The

fearful disease pyaemia likewise disappeared, and erysipelas soon followed

its example.

     But it was by no means only in removing the unhealthiness of hos-
pitals that the antiseptic system showed its benefits. Inflammation being
suppressed, with attendant pain, fever, and wasting discharge, the sufier-
ings of the patient were, of course, immensely lessened ; rapid primary
union being now the rule, convalescence was correspondingly curtailed

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

while as regards safety and the essential nature of the mode of rejiair, it
became a matter of indiflference whether the wound had clean-cut surfaces
which could be closely approximated, or whether the injury inflicted had

been such as to cause destruction of tissue. And operations which had

been regarded from time immemorial as unjustifiable were adojsted with
complete safety.

    It pleases me to think that there is an ever-increasing number of prac-
titioners throughout the world to whom this will not appear the language

of exaggeration. There are cases in which, from the situation of the part
concerned or other unusual circumstances, it is impossible to carry out the
antiseptic system completely. These, however, are quite exceptional; and

even in them much has been done to mitigate the evil which cannot be

altogether avoided.

      I ask your indulgence if I have seemed to dwell too long upon matters

in which I have been personally concerned. I now gladly return to the

laljours of others.

     The striking results of the application of the germ theory to Surgery

acted as a powerful stimulus to the investigation of the nature of the
                                                ADDRESS.                                                15

micro-organisms concerned ; and it soon appeared that putrefaction was

by no means the only evil of microbic origin to which wounds were liable.

I had myself very early noticed that hospital gangrene was not necessarily

attended                   by  any  unpleasant  odour                          and I afterwards made a  similar
                                                                            ;

observation regarding the matter formed in a remarkable epidemic of

erysipelas in Edinburgh obviously of infective character. I had also seen

a careless dressing followed by the occurrence of suppuration without

putrefaction. And as these non-putrefactive disordei's had the same self-

propagating property as ferments, and were suppressed by the same anti-

septic agencies which were used for combating the putrefactive microbes,

I did not doubt that they were of an analogous origin ; and I ventured

to express the view that, just as tlie various fermentations had each its

special microbe, so it might be with the various complications of wounds.

This surmise was afterwards amply verified. Professor Ogston, of Aber-

deen, was an eai-ly worker in this field, and showed that in acute abscesses,

that is to say those which run a rapid course, the matter, although often

quite free from unpleasant odour, invariably contains micro-organisms

belonging to the group which, from the spherical form of their elements,

are termed micrococci ; and these he classed as streptococci or staphylo-

cocci, according as they were arranged in chains or disposed in irregular

clusters like bunches of grapes. The German pathologist, Fehleisen, fol-

lowed with a beautiful research, by which he clearly proved that erysipelas

Ais caused by a streptococcus.                  host of earnest workers in different

countries have cultivated the new science of Bacteriology, and, while

opening up a wide fresh domain of Biology, have demonstrated in so many

cases the causal relation between special micro-organisms and special

diseases, not only in wounds but in the system generally, as to afford

ample confirmation of the induction which had been made by Pasteur

that all infective disorders are of microbic orisin.

Not that we can look forward with anything like confidence to being

able ever to see the materies morbi of every disease of this nature. One of

the latest of such discoveries has been that by Pfeiffer of Berlin of the

bacillus of influenza, perhaps the most minute of all micro-organisms ever

yet detected. The bacillus of anthrax, the cause of a plague common
among cattle in some parts of Europe, and often communicated to sorters

of foi-eign wool in this country, is a giant as compared with this tiny

being                      and supposing  the microbe of any infectious fever  to be  as                much
                        ;

smaller than the influenza bacillus as this is less than that of anthrax, a
by no means unlikely hypothesis, it is probable that it would never be

visible to man. The improvements of the microscope, based on the

principle established by my father in the earlier part of the century,

ha^'e apparently nearly reached the limits of what is possible. But that

such parasites are really the causes of all this great class of diseases can

no longer be doubted.

The first rational step towards the prevention or cure of disease is to

know its cause ; and it is impossible to over-estimate the practical value

of researches such as those to which I am now referring. Among their
many achievements is what may be fairly regarded as the most important

discovery ever made in pathology, because it revealed the true nature of
the disease which causes more sickness and death in the human race than
any other. It was made by Robert Koch, who greatly distinguished
himself, when a practitioner in an obscure town in Germany, by the
remarkable combination of experimental acuteness and skill, chemical
and optical knowledge and successful micro-photography which he brought
to bear upon the elucidation of infective diseases of wounds in the lower

animals ; in recognition of which service the enlightened Prussian
Government at once appointed him to an official position of great impor-
tance in Berlin. There he conducted various important researches ; and
at the London Congress in 1881 he showed to us for the first time the
bacillus of tubercle. Wonderful light was thrown by this discovery upon

a great group of diseases which had before been rather guessed than known
to be of allied nature ; a precision and efficacy never before possible
was introduced into their surgical treatment, while the physician became
guided by new and sure light as regards their diagnosis and prevention.

     At that same London Congress Koch demonstrated to us his * plate

culture ' of bacteria, which was so important that I must devote a few

words to its description. With a view to the successful study of the

liabits and effects of any particular microbe outside the living body, it is
essential that it should be present unmixed in the medium in which it is
cultivated. It can be readily understood how difficult it must have been
to isolate any particular micro-organism when it existed mixed, as was
 often the case, with a multitude of other forms. In fact, the various in-
 genious attempts made to effect this object had often proved entire failures.
 Koch, however, by an ingenious procedure converted what had been before
 impossible into a matter of the utmost facility. In the broth or other
 nutrient liquid which was to serve as food for the growing microbe he
 dissolved, by aid of heat, just enough gelatine to ensure that, while it
 should become a solid mass when cold, it should remain fluid though re-

duced in temperature so much as to be incapable of killing living germs.
To the medium thus partially cooled was added some liquid containing,
 among others, the microbe to be investigated ; and the mixture was
 thoroughly shaken so as to diffuse the bacteria and separate them from
 each other. Some of the liquid was then poured out in a thin layer upon
 a glass plate and allowed to cool so as to assume the solid form. The
 various microbes, fixed in the gelatine and so prevented from inter-

 mingling, proceeded to develop each its special progeny, which in course

 of time showed itself as an opaque speck in the transparent film. Any

 one of such specks could now be removed and transferred to another vessel

 in which the microbe composing it grew in perfect isolation,

the great progress effected by the new method. It was soon introduced
into his own institute and other laboratories throughout the world ; and

it has immensely facilitated bacteriological study.

     One fruit of it in Koch's own hands was the discovery of the microbe
of cholera in India, whither he went to study the disease. This organism
was termed by Koch from its curved form the ' comma bacillus,' and by

the French the cholera vibrio. Great doubts were for a long time felt
regarding this discovery. Several other kinds of bacteria were found of
the same shape, some of them producing very similar appearances in cul-

ture media. But bacteriologists are now universally agreed that, although

various other conditions are necessary to the production of an attack of
cholera besides the mere presence of the vibrio, yet it is the essential
materies morbi ; and it is by the aid of the. diagnosis which its presence in
any case of true cholera enables the bacteriologist to make, that threatened
invasions of this awful disease have of late years been so successfully
repelled from our shores. If bacteriology had done nothing more for us
than this, it might well have earned our gratitude.

     I have next to invite your attention to some earlier work of Pasteur.
There is a disease known in France under the name of cholera des j)oules,
which often produced great havoc among the poultry yards of Paris. It
had been observed that the blood of birds that had died of this disease
was peopled by a multitude of minute bacteria, not very dissimilar in form
and size to the microbe of the lactic ferment to which I have before

referred. And Pasteur found that, if this bacterium was cultivated out-

side the body for a protracted period under certain conditions, it under-
went a remarkable diminution of its virulence ; so that, if inoculated into
a healthy fowl, it no longer caused the death of the bird , as it would have
done in its original condition, but produced a milder form of the disease

which was not fatal. And this altered character of the microbe, caused

by certain conditions, was found to persist in successive generations culti-
vated in the ordinary way. Thus was discovered the great fact of what
Pasteur termed the attenuation des virus, which at once gave the clue to
understanding what had before been quite mysterious, the difference in
virulence of the same disease in different epidemics.

     But he made the further very important observation that a bird which
had gone through the mild form of the complaint had acquired immunity
against it in its most virulent condition. Pasteur afterwards succeeded
in obtaining mitigated varieties of microbes for some other diseases ; and
he applied with great success the principle which he had discovered in

fowl-cholera for protecting the larger domestic animals against the plague

of anthrax. The preparations used for such preventive inoculations he
termed 'vaccins' in honour of our great countryman, Edward Jenner.
For Pasteur at once saw the analogy between the immunity to fowl-
cholera produced by its attenuated virus and the protection afforded

against small-pox by vaccination. And while pathologists still hesitated,

1896.            c
18 REPORT-- 1896.

he had no doubt of the correctness of Jenner's expression vm-iolce vaccince,
or small-pox in the cow.

     It is just a hundred years since Jenner made the crucial experiment of

inoculating with small-pox a boy whom he had previously vaccinated, the
result being, as he anticipated, that the boy was quite vmaffected. It may

be remarked that this was a perfectly legitimate experiment, involving no
danger to the subject of it. Inoculation was at that time the established
practice ; and if vaccination should prove nugatory, the inoculation would
be only what would have been otherwise called for ; while it would be per-
fectly harmless if the hoped-for effect of vaccination had been produced.

     "We are a practical people, not much addicted to personal commemora-

tions : although our nation did indeed celebrate with fitting splendour the

jubilee of the reign of our beloved Queen ; and at the invitation of
Glasgow the scientific world has lately marked in a manner, though

different, as imposing, the jubilee of the life-work of a sovereign in science

(Lord Kelvin). But while we cannot be astonished that the centenary of

Jenner's immortal discovery should have failed to receive general recogni-
tion in this country, it is melancholy to think that this year should, in his
native county, have been distinguished by a terrible illustration of the
results which would sooner or later inevitably follow the general neglect

of his prescriptions.

     I have no desire to speak severely of the Gloucester Guardians. They
are not sanitary authorities, and had not the technical knowledge neces-
sary to enable them to judge between the teachings of true science and
the declamations of misguided, though well-meaning, enthusiasts. They
did what they believed to be right ; and when roused to a sense of the

greatness of their mistake, they did their very best to repair it, so that

their city is said to be now the best vaccinated in Her Majesty's dominions.
But though by their praiseworthy exertions they succeeded in promptly

checking the raging epidemic, they cannot recall the dead to life, or

restore beauty to marred features, or sight to blinded eyes. Would that

the entire country and our Legislature might take duly to heart this

object-lesson !

    How completely the medical profession were convinced of the efficacy

of vaccination in the early part of this century was strikingly illustrated
by an account given by Professor Crookshank, in his interesting history of

this subject, of several eminent medical men in Edinbui'gh meeting to see

 the to them unprecedented fact of a vaccinated person having taken small-
 pox. It has, of course, since become well known that the milder form
of the disease, as modified by passing through the cow, confers a less
 permanent protection than the original human disorder. This it was, of
 course, impossible for Jenner to foresee. It is, indeed, a question of
degree, since a second attack of ordinary small-pox is occasionally known
to occur, and vaccination, long after it has ceased to give perfect immu-
nity, greatly modifies the character of the disorder and diminishes its
                                    ADDRESS.                                 19

danger. And, happily, in re-vaccination after a certain number of years

we have the means of making Jenner's work complete. I understand
that the majority of the Commissioners, who have recently issued their

report upon this subject, while recognising the value and importance of

re- vaccination, are so impressed with the difficulties that would attend
making it compulsory by legislation that they do not recommend that

course ; although it is advocated by two of their number who are of

peculiarly high authority on such a question. I was lately told by a

Berlin professor that no serious difficulty is experienced in carrying out

the compulsory law that prevails in Germany. The masters of the

schools are directed to ascertain in the case of every child attaining the

age of twelve whether re-vaccination has been practised. If not, and

the parents refuse to have it done, they are fined one mark. If this does

not prove effectual, the fine is doubled : and if even the double penalty
should not prove efficacious, a second doubling of it would follow, but, as

my informant remarked, it is very seldom that it is called for. The

result  is  that  small-pox  is  a  matter  of  extreme rai'ity in that  country
                                                                                                        ;

while it is almost unknown in the huge German army, in consequence

of the rule that every soldier is re- vaccinated on entering the service.

Whatever view our Legislature may take on this question, one thing

seems to me clear : that it will be the duty of Government to encourage

by every available means the use of calf lymph, so as to exclude the

possibility of the communication of any human disease to the child, and

to institute such efficient inspection of vaccination institutes as shall

ensure careful antiseptic arrangements, and so prevent contamination

by extraneous microbes. If this were done, 'conscientious objections'

would cease to have any rational basis. At the same time, the ad-

ministration of the regulations on vaccination should be transferred (as

advised by the Commissioners) to competent sanitary authorities.

But to return to Pasteur. In IStfO he entered upon the study of

that terrible but then most obscure disease, Hydrophobia or Rabies, which

from its infective character he was sure must be of microbic origin,

although no micro-organism could be detected in it. He early demon-

strated the new pathological fact that the virus had its essential seat in

the nervous system. This proved the key to his success in this subject.

One result that flowed from it has been the cause of unspeakable consola-

I tion to many. The foolish practice is still too prevalent of killing the dog
      that has bitten any one, on the absurd notion that, if it were mad, its

destruction would prevent the occurrence of Hydrophobia in the person

bitten. The idea of the bare possibility of the animal having been so

affected causes an agony of suspense during the long weeks or months of
possible incubation of the disease. Very serious nervous symptoms aping

true Hydrophobia have been known to result from the terror thus inspired.

Pasteur showed that if a little of the brain or spinal cord of a dog that had

been really mad was inoculated in an appropriate manner into a rabbit, it

                                                                         c2
--20 REPORT 1896.

infallibly caused rabies in that animal in a few days. If therefore such

an experiment was made with a negative result, the conclusion might
be drawn with certainty that the dog had been healthy. It is perhaps
right that I should say that the inoculation is painlessly done under an
anaesthetic, and that in the rabbit rabies does not assume the violent form
that it does in the dog, but produces gradual loss of power with little if

any suffering.

     This is the more satisfactory because rabbits in which the disease has

been thus artificially induced are employed in carrying out what was

Pasteur's greatest triumph, the preventive treatment of Hydrophobia in

Wethe human subject.                         have seen that Pasteur discovered that microbes

might under some circumstances undergo mitigation of their virulence.

He afterwards found that under different conditions they might have it

exalted, or, as he expressed it, there might be a renforcement du virus.

Such proved to be the case with rabies in the rabbit ; so that the spinal
cords of animals which had died of it contained the poison in a highly
intensified condition. But he also found that if such a highly virulent

cord was suspended under strict antiseptic precautions in a dry atmosphere
at a certain temperature, it gradually from day to day lost in potency, till
in course of time it became absolutely inert. If now an emulsion of such

a harmless cord was introduced under the skin of an animal, as in the
subcutaneous administration of morphia, it might be followed without harm
another day by a similar dose of a cord still rather poisonous ; and so from
day to day stronger and stronger injections might be used, the system

becoming gradually accustomed to the poison, till a degree of virulence

had been reached far exceeding that of the bite of a mad dog. When this

had been attained, the animal proved incapable of taking the disease in

the  ordinary   way                     and  more  than that,  if  such treatment was  adopted
                                     ;

after an animal had already received the poison, provided that too long a

time had not elapsed, the outbreak of the disease was prevented. It was

only after great searching of heart that Pasteur, after consultation with
some trusted medical friends, ventured upon trying this practice upon

man. It has since been extensively adopted in various parts of the world

with increasing success as the details of the method wei-e improved. It is

not of course the case that every one bitten by a really rabid animal takes

the disease ; but the percentage of those who do so, which was formerly

large, has been reduced almost to zero by this treatment, if not too long

delayed.

     While the intensity of rabies in the rabbit is undoubtedly due to a
peculiarly virulent form of the microbe concerned, we cannot suppose that

the daily diminishing potency of the cord suspended in dry warm air is

an instance of attenuation of virus, using the term ' virus ' as synonymous
with the microbe concerned. In other words, we have no reason to

believe that the special micro-organism of hydrophobia continues to

develop in the dead cord and produce successively a milder and milder
                                         ADDRESS.                                     21

progeny ; since rabies cannot be cultivated in the nervous system of a dead

Weanimal.                 must rather conclude that there must be some chemical

poison present which gradually loses its potency as time passes. And this

leads me to refer to another most important branch of this large subject

of bacteriology, that of the poisonous products of microbes.

It was shown several years ago by Roux and Yersin, working in the

Institut Pasteur, that the crust or false membrane which forms upon the

throats of patients affected with diphtheria contains bacteria which can

be cultivated outside the body in a nutrient liquid, with the result that it

acquires poisonous qualities of astonishing intensity, comparable to that

of the secretion of the poison-glands of the most venomous serpents.

And they also ascertained that the liquid retained this property after the

microbes had been removed from it by filtration, which proved that the

poison must be a chemical substance in solution, as distinguished from the

living element which had produced it. These poisonous products of

bacteria, or toxins as they have been termed, explain the deadly effects of

some microbes, which it would otherwise be impossible to understand.

Thus, in diphtheria itself the special bacillus which was shown by Loffler

to be its cause, does not become propagated in the blood, like the microbe

of chicken cholera, but remains confined to the surface on which it first

appeared : but the toxin which it secretes is absorbed from that surface

into the blood, and so poisons the system. Similar observations have

been made with regard to the microbes of some other diseases, as, for

example, the bacillus of tetanus or lockjaw. This remains localised in

the wound, but forms a special toxin of extreme potency, which becomes

absorbed and diffused through the body.

     Wonderful as it seems, each poisonous microbe appears to form its

own peculiar toxin. Koch's tuberculin was of this nature ; a product of

the growth of the tubercle bacillus in culture media. Here, again, great

effects were produced by                 extremely minute  quantities    of  the  substance
                                                                                                                    ;

but here a new peculiarity showed itself, viz. that patients affected with

tubercular disease, in any of its varied forms, exhibited inflammation in

the affected part and general fever after receiving under the skin an

amount of the material which had no effect whatever upon healthy

persons. I witnessed in Berlin some instances of these effects, which

were simply astounding. Patients affected with a peculiar form of obsti-

nate ulcer of the face showed, after a single injection of the tuberculin,

violent inflammatory redness and swelling of the sore and surrounding

skin                      and, what was  equally surprising, when  this  disturbance  subsided
                       ;

the disease was found to have undergone great improvement. By repeti-

tions of such procedures, ulcers which had previously been steadily

advancing, in spite of ordinary treatment, became greatly reduced in size,

and in some instances apparently cured. Such results led Koch to believe

that he had obtained an eflectual means of dealing with tubercular disease

in all its forms. Unhappily, the apparent cure proved to be only of
--22 REroRT 1896.

transient duration, and the high hopes which had been inspired by Koch's
great reputation were dashed. It is but fair to say that he was sti'ongly

urf^ed to publish befoi'e he was himself disposed to do so, and we cannot

but regret that he yielded to the pressure put upon him.
     But though Koch's sanguine anticipations Avere not realised, it would

be a great mistake to suppiise that his labours with tuberculin have been

fruitless. Cattle are liable to tubercle, and, when aifected with it, may
become a very serious source of infection for human beings, more especially
when the disease affects the udders of cows, and so contaminates the milk.
By virtue of the close affinity that prevails between the lower animals and

ourselves, in disease as well as in health, tuberculin produces fever in tuber-
cular cows in doses which do not affect healthy beasts. Thus, by the
subcutaneous use of a little of the fluid, tubercle latent in internal organs

of an apparently healthy cow can be with certainty revealed, and the

slaughter of the animal after this discovery protects man from infection.

      It has been ascertained that glanders presents a precise analogy with
tubercle as regards the effects of its toxic products. If the microbe which
has been found to be the cause of this disease is cultivated in appropriate

media, it pi'oduces a poison which has received the name of mallein, and

the subcutaneous injection of a suitable dose of this fluid into a glandcred

horse causes striking febrile symptoms which do not occur in a healthy

animal. Glanders, like tubercle, may exist in insidious latent forms

which thei-e was formerly no possibility of detecting, but which are at
once disclosed by this means. If a glandered horse has been accidentally
introduced into a large stable, this method of diagnosis surely tells if it
has infected others. All receive a little mallein. Those which become
affected with fever are slaughtered, and thus not only is the disease pre-
vented from spreading to other horses, but the grooms are protected from

a mortal disorder.

     This valuable resource sprang from Koch's work on tuberculin, which
has also indirectly done good in other ways. His distinguished pupil,

Behring, has expressly attributed to those researches the inspiration of

the work which led him and his since famous collaborateur, the Japanese
Kitasato, to their sui'prising discovery of anti-toxic serum. They found
that if an animal of a species liable to diphtheria or tetanus received a
quantity of the respective toxin, so small as to be harmless, and after-
wards, at suitable intervals, successively stronger and stronger doses, the

creature, in course of time, acquired such a tolerance for the poison as to

be able to receive with impunity a quantity very much greater than
would at the outset have proved fatal. So far, we have nothing more

than seems to correspond with the effects of the increasingly potent cords

in Pasteur's treatment of rabies. But what was entirely new in their
results was that, if blood was drawn from an animal which had acquired
this high degree of artificial immunity, and some of the clear fluid or
scrum which exuded from it after it had clotted was introduced under the
                          ADDRESS.                                                                     28

skin of another animal, this second animal acquired a sti'ong, though more

transient, immunity against the particular toxin concerned. The serum
in some way counteracted the toxin or was antitoxic. But, more than

that, if some of the antitoxic serum was applied to an animal after it had

already received a poisonous dose of the toxin, it preserved the life of the

creature, provided that too long a time had not elapsed after the poison

was introduced. In other words, the antitoxin proved to be not only

preventive but curative.

Similar results were afterwards obtained by Ehrlich, of Berlin, with

some poisons not of bacterial origin, but derived from the vegetable

kingdom ; and quite recently the independent labours of Calmette of
Lille and Fraser of Edinburgh have shown that antidotes of wonderful

efficacy against the venom of serpents may be procured on the same prin-

ciple. Calmette has obtained antitoxin so powerful that a quantity of it

only a 200,000th part of the weight of an animal will protect it perfectly

against a dose of the secretion of the poison-glands of the most venomous

serpents known to exist, which without such protection would have proved

fatal in four hours. For curative purposes larger quantities of the remedy are

required, but cases have been already published by Calmette in which death

appears to have been averted in the human subject by this treatment.

Behring's darling object was to discover means of curing tetanus and

diphtheria in man. In tetanus the conditions are not favourable ; because

the specific bacilli lurk in the depths of the wound, and only declare their

presence by symptoms caused by their toxin having been already in a

greater or less amount diffused through the  system                                    and  in  every  case of
                                                                                    ;

this disease there must be a fear that the antidote may be applied too late

to be useful. But in diphtheria the bacilli very early manifest their pre-

sence by the false membrane which they cause upon the throat, so that

the antitoxin has a fair chance ; and here we are justified in saying that

Behring's object has been attained.

The problem, however, was by no means so simple as in the case of

some mere chemical poison. However effectual the antitoxin might be

against the toxin, if it left the bacilli intact, not only would repeated

injections be required to maintain the transient immunity to the j^oison

perpetually secreted by the microbes, but the bacilli might by their growth

and extension cause obstruction of the respiratory passages.

     Roux, however, whose name must always be mentioned with honour

Hein relation to this subject, effectually disposed of this difficulty.

showed by experiments on animals that a diphtheritic false membrane,

rapidly extending and accompanied by surrounding inflammation, was

brought to a stand by the use of the antitoxin, and soon dropped off,

leaving a healthy surface. Whatever be the explanation, the fact was

thus established that the antitoxic serum, while it renders the toxin

harmless, causes the microbe to languish and disappear.

    No theoretical objection could now be urged against the treatment
--24 REPORT 1896.

and it has during the last two years been extensively tested in practice in

various parts of the world, and it has gradually made its way more and
more into the confidence of the profession. One important piece of evi-

dence in its favour in this country is derived from the report of the six

large hospitals under the management of the London Asylums Board.
The medical officers of these hospitals at first naturally regarded the prac-

tice with scepticism : but as it appeared to be at least harmless, they
gave it a trial ; and during the year 1895 it was very generally employed
upon the 2,182 cases admitted ; and they have all become convinced of
its great value. In the nature of things, if the theory of the treatment

is correct, the best results must be obtained when the patients are
admitted at an early stage of the attack, before there has been time
for much poisoning of the system : and accordingly we learn from the

report that, comparing 1895 with 1894, during which latter year the
ordinary treatment had been used, the percentage of mortality, in all

the six hospitals combined, among the patients admitted on the first day
of the disease, which in 1894 was 22*5, was only 4"6 in 1895 ; and for
those admitted on the second day the numbers are 27 for 1894 and 14*8
for 1895. Thus for cases admitted on the first day the mortality was
only one-fifth of what it was in the previous year, and for those enter-
ing on the second it was halved. Unfortunately in the low parts of
London which furnish most of these patients the parents too often delay
sending in the children till much later : so that on the average no less

than 67 "5 per cent, were admitted on the fourth day of the disease or later.
Hence the aggregate statistics of all cases are not nearly so striking.
Nevertheless, taking it altogether, the mortality in 1895 was less than had
ever before been experienced in those hospitals. I should add that there
was no reason to think that the disease was of a milder type than usual

in 1895 ; and no change whatever was made in the treatment except as

regards the antitoxic injections.
      There is one piece of evidence recorded in the report which, though it

is not concerned with high numbers, is well worthy of notice. It relates
to a special institution to which convalescents from scarlet fever are sent
from all the six hospitals. Such patients occasionally contract diphtheria,
and when they do so the added disease has generally proved extremely fatal.
In the five years preceding the introduction of the treatment with anti-
toxin the mortality from this cause had never been less than 50 per cent,,
and averaged on the whole 61-9 per cent. During 1895, under antitoxin,
the deaths among the 119 patients of this class were only 7-5 per cent.,
or one- eighth of what had been previously experienced. This very strik-
ing result seems to be naturally explained by the fact that these patients

being already in hospital when the diphtheria appeared, an unusually
early opportunity was afforded for dealing with it.

     There are certain cases of so malignant a character from the first that
no treatment will probably ever be able to cope with them. But taking
ADDRES3.  25

  all cases together it seems probable that Behring's hope that the mortality

  may be reduced to 5 per cent, will be fully realised when the public

  become ali\e to the paramount importance of having the treatment com-
  menced at the outset of the disease.

      There are many able workers in the field of Bacteriology whose names
 time does not permit me to mention, and to whose important labours I

  cannot refer ; and even those researches of which I have spoken have

  been, of course, most inadequately dealt with. I feel this especially with
  regard to Pasteur, whose work shines out more brightly the more his

  writings are perused.

       I have lastly to bring before you a subject which, though not bacterio-

 logical, has intimate relations with bacteria. If a drop of blood is drawn
 from the finger by a prick with a needle and examined microscopically
  between two plates of glass, there are seen in it minute solid elements of
  two kinds, the one pale orange bi-concave discs, which, seen in mass, give

 the red colour to the vital fluid, the other more or less granular spherical

 masses of the soft material called protoplasm, destitute of colour, and
 therefore called the colourless or white corpuscles. It has been long

 known that if the microscope was placed at such a distance from a fire as
 to have the temperature of the human body, the white corpuscles might
 be seen to put out and retract little processes or pseudopodia, and by their
 means crawl over the surface of the glass, just like the extremely low

 forms of animal life termed, from this faculty of changing their form,
 amoebae. It was a somewhat weird spectacle, that of seeing what had
just before been coursing through our veins moving about like inde-
 pendent creatures. Yet there was nothing in this inconsistent with what

 we knew of the fixed components of the animal frame. For example, the

 surface of a frog's tongue is covered with a layer of cells, each of which is
 provided with two or mdre lashing filaments or cilia, and those of all the
 cells acting in concert cause a constant flow of fluid in a definite direction

over the organ. If we gently scrape the surface of the animal's tongue,
we can detach some of these ciliated cells ; and on examining them with
the microscope in a drop of water, we find that they will continue for an
indefinite time their lashing movements, which are just as much living or
vital in their character as the writhings of a worm. And, as I observed
many years ago, these detached cells behave under the influence of a
stimulus just like parts connected with the body, the movements of the
cilia being excited to greater activity by gentle stimulation, and thrown
into a state of temporary inactivity when the irritation was more severe.
Thus each constituent element of our bodies may be regarded as in one
sense an independent living being, though all work together in marvellous
harmony for the good of the body politic. The independent movements

of the white corpuscles outside the body were therefore not astonishing : but

they long remained matters of mere curiosity. Much interest was called to
them by the observation of the German pathologist Cohnheim that in some
26 REPORT--1896.

inflammatory conditions they passed through the pores in the walls of the
finest blood-vessels, and thus escaped into the interstices of the surrounding
tissues. Cohnheim attributed their transit to the pressure of the blood.

But why it was that, though larger than the red corpuscles, and contain-

ing a nucleus which the red ones have not, they alone passed through

the pores of the vessels, or why it was that this emigration of the white

corpuscles occurred abundantly in some inflammations and was absent
in others, was quite unexplained.

      These white corpuscles, however, have been invested with extraordi-

nary new interest by the researches of the Russian naturalist and patholo-

gist, Metchnikoff. He observed that, after passing through the walls of

the vessels, they not only crawl about like amceb?e, but, like them, receive
nutritious materials into their soft bodies and digest them. It is thus that
the effete materials of a tadpole's tail are got rid of ; so that they play a
most important part in the function of absorption.

    But still more interesting observations followed. He found that a

microscopic crustacean, a kind of water-flea, was liable to be infested
by a fungus which had exceedingly sharp-pointed spores. These were
apt to penetrate the coats of the creature's intestine, and project into

its body-cavity. No sooner did this occur with any spore than it became

surrounded by a group of the cells which are contained in the cavity of
the body and correspond to the white corpuscles of our blood. These
proceeded to attempt to devour the spore ; and if they succeeded, in
every such case, the animal was saved from the invasion of the parasite.
But if the spores were more than could be disposed of by the devouring
cells (phagocytes, as Metchnikofl" termed them), the water-flea succumbed.

      Starting from this fundamental observation, he ascertained that the
microbes of infective diseases are subject to this same process of devouring
and digestion, carried on both by the white corpuscles and by cells that line

the blood-vessels. And by a long series of most beautiful researches he has,

as it appears to me, firmly established the great truth that phagocytosis

is the main defensive means possessed by the living body against the inva-
sions of its microscopic foes. The power of the system to produce anti-
toxic substances to counteract the poisons of microbes is undoubtedly in
its own place of great importance. But in the large class of cases in
which animals are naturally refractory to particular infective diseases the
blood is not found to yield any antitoxic element by which the natural
immunity can be accounted for. Here phagocytosis seems to be the sole

defensive agency. And even in cases in which the serum does possess

antitoxic, or, as it would seem in some cases, germicidal properties, the
bodies of the dead microbes must at last be got rid of by phagocytosis,
and some recent observations would seem to indicate that the useful

elements of the serum may be, in part at least, derived from the digestive

juices of the phagocytes. If ever there was a romantic chapter in
pathology, it has surely been that of the story of phagocytosis.
                                                                          ADDRESS.                                               27

     I was myself peculiarly interested by these observations of Metchni-

koff's, because they seemed to me to aflFord clear explanation of the healing

of wounds by first intention under circumstances before incomprehensible.

Complete primary union was sometimes seen to take place in wounds treated
with water-dressing, that is to say, a piece of wet lint covered with au

layer of oiled-silk to keep it moist. This, though cleanly when applied, was

invariably putrid within twenty-four hours. The layer of blood between the

cut surfaces was thus exposed at the outlet of the wound to a most potent

Howseptic focus.                                                          was it prevented from putrefying, as it would have

done under such influence if, instead of being between divided living
tissues, it had been between plates of glass or other indifferent material ?'

Pasteur's observations pushed the question a step further. It now was,

How were the bacteria of putrefaction kept from propagating in the

decomposable film ? Metchnikoff's phagocytosis supplied the answer.

The blood between the lips of the wound became rapidly peopled with

phagocytes, which kept guard against the putrefactive microbes and
seized them as they endeavoured to enter.

     If phagocytosis was ever able to cope with septic microbes in so con-

centrated and intense a form, it could hardly fail to deal effectually with

them in the very mitigated condition in which they are present in the

Weair. are thus strongly confirmed in our conclusion that the atmo-

spheric dust may safely be disregarded in our operations : and Metchni-

koff's researches, while they have illumined the whole pathology of
infective diseases, have beautifully completed the theory of antiseptic
treatment in surgery.

    I might have taken equally striking illustrations of my theme from other

departments in which microbes play no part. In fact any attempt to
speak of all that the art of healing has borrowed from science and con-

tributed to it during the past half-century would involve a very extensive

dissertation on pathology and therapeutics. I have culled specimens

from a wide field                                                         and I only hope  that in  bringing  them  before  you  I

have not overstepped the bounds of what is fitting before a mixed

company. For many of you my remarks can have had little if any

novelty                                      for  others                  they may perhaps  possess  some     interest  as  showing

--that Medicine is no unworthy ally of the British Association that, while

her practice is ever more and more based on science, the ceaseless efforts

of her votaries to improve what have been fittingly designated Quce

prosunt omnibus artes, are ever adding largely to the sum of abstract

knowledge.

                         First Conference, Septeaiber 17, 1896.

     The first meeting of the Conference took place in the Crown Court,
adjoining the Reception Room, St. George's Hall.

     The Chairman, Dr. Garson, opened the proceedings by expressing his
re<yret that serious illness prevented Mr. Whitaker from being present,
though he was glad to be able to add that the latest accounts of him were

that he was progressing satisfactorily. He was pleased to see a larger

number of delegates than usual, as a sign that the connection of the
Corresponding Societies with the British Association was becoming more
                     CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.                  33

and more appreciated. He hoped the delegates would attend regularly,

so that they might the better explain to their respective Societies on their
I'eturn home the nature of the work in which they were asked to

co-operate.

      Mr. George Abbott, M.Il.C.8., General Secretary of the Soutli Eastern

Union of Scientific Societies, then read a short paper entitled ' District

Unions of Natural History Societies.' Mr. Abbott remarked that while local

Natural History Societies had done much good work, yet that in many

cases their eflfbrts had been weak, irregular, and desultory. He thought

Athe chief cause of failure had been want of organisation.  step in the

right direction had been taken by the Unions of Scientific Societies already

existing, such as those of Yorkshire and the East of Scotland, but he

       considered that the British Association did not sufficiently foster such

^ unions. He therefore felt that a plan was necessary which would organise
      the local societies under the guidance of the British Association, which

should help to bring these unions into being through the agency of an

organising secretary. He submitted the following plan for the consideration

of the Conference :

--Districts. The United Kingdom should be divided into fifteen or

twenty districts, in each of which all Natural History Societies should

be affiliated for mutual aid, counsel, and work. Existing unions should

perhaps be imitated, at any rate not disturbed.

Geographical lines should decide their size, which might vary in extent

and be dependent, in some measure, on railway facilities. From time

to time these areas might be subject to review, and necessary changes

   --made.
           Congress. Each of such unions would have its annual congress

^ attended by delegates and members from its affiliated societies. This
     would be held in a fresh town every year, with a new president, somewhat

after the manner of the British Association itself. The congresses would

probably take place in spring, but two should never be held on the same

day.

These unions Avould render important help to local societies, would

bring isolated workers together, assist schools, colleges, and technical

institutes and museums, start new societies, and revive waning ones.

Through these annual meetings local and petty jealousies would lessen or

--turn to friendly rivalries each society trying to excel in real work,

activity, and good science teaching.

Further, economy of labour would be accomplished by a precise

demarcation of area for each local society. This would be understood as

its sphere of work and influence ; in this portion of country it would
have a certain amount of responsibility in such matters as observation,

research, and vigilance against encroachments on footpaths, commons,

and wayside wastes.

These unions might also, through their Central Committees, bring

about desirable improvements in publication, but it would perhaps not

be desirable, in all cases, to go in for joint publication. In this, as in

other matters connected with the unions, co-operation and not imiformity

must be our aim.

  --Utiion Committees. Each union would need a general secretary and a

committee, all of whom should be intimately acquainted with methods of

work and the best ambitions of local societies.

--34 REPORT 1896.

  --Corresjwndincf Members. This is another necessary development.

Each local society should appoint in every village in its district a corre-
sponding member with some distinctive title, and certain privileges and

advantages.

    The work asked of him would be to^

     1. Forward surplus Natural History specimens to their Society's
Museum.

     2. Supply prompt information on the following subjects :

     New(a) geological sections.

        (6) Details of wells, borings, springs, tl-c.

       (c) Find.s of geological and antiquai-ian interest.

     3. Answer such questions as the British Association or the local
society may require.

     4. Keep an eye on historic buildings.

   --5. Assist the Selborne Society in carrying out its objects.

    No mean occupation certainly a useful, attractive, and honourable

--post worthy of any man's acceptance.

     In return he should be offered

     1. Assistance in naming specimens, and with the formation of school
museums.

     2. Free admission to lectures and excursions.

      3. Copies of transactions.
      4. Free use of the Society's library.

     Every village would soon, under this scheme, possess an agent,
registrar, or whatever you like to call him, who would be more and more

--able, as he gained experience, to further the aims of this association.
     Expenses or Ways and Means. This cannot be ignored, but would

not form a sufficient barrier to prevent the adoption of the scheme.
     The unions would be self-supporting, by means of small contributions

from the affiliated societies. Money is only wanting for the expenses of

an organising secretary. I do not attempt to estimate the cost of this, but
with objects so desirable and far-reaching in view, the price cannot be
considered excessive, and the British Association would soon be repaid by
obtaining prompt and direct communication with all the towns and
villages in Great Britain, by greater assistance in its research work and
in all other branches which the British Association was established sixty-
iive years ago to promote.

     Tiio Chairman was sure that they all felt much obliged to Mr. Abbott

for his paper on this important subject. He invited discussion.

     The Rev. E. P. Knubley remarked that he would give briefly the
results of the experience of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union during the
twenty years of its existence. It was, he believed, the largest union of
scientific societies in England, having thirty-six affiliated associations.
There were 500 members and 2,-500 associates, making a total of 3,000

workers. He thought they owed much to their geographical position and
to the great variety of rocks, scenery, soil, and climate in Yorkshire. As

to the organisation of the Union, it was based to a considerable extent on
that of the British Association. Their president, a distinguished York-
shireman, was elected annually. There wei'e general secretaries, an
executive of twelve members, and a general committee. Their work

--came under five sections ^those of geology, botany, zoology, conchology,

and entomology. In addition, much work was carried on by means of

research committees, which were in direct communication with the British

Association. Eight such committees were then in existence : a Boulder

Committee ;    a Sea Coast Erosion                                           Committee                                              a Fossil Flora Committee                                        ;
                                                                                                                                 ;

Committees reported annually, and their Reports were presented to the

British Association. An annual meeting of the Union was held in one

of the Yorkshire towns. For excursion purposes Yorkshire was divided

into five parts, and a meeting was held in each of them. One meeting

every year took place on the sea coast. Great care was taken by the

secretaries before each excursion to get all the geological, botanical, and

other information obtainable about the place to be visited, and, when
there, every endeavour was made to get each member to do some special

work. In short, every eSbrt was made to train workers in the various

departments of natural science. It has been found necessary to discourage

Hethe ofii&ring of hospitality, on account of the loss of time involved.

would only add that the success of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union was

largely due to the energy and perseverance of their general secretary,

Mr. W. D. Roebuck.

   The Chairman asked Mr. Knubley how many of the Yorkshire

Scientific Associations which were on the list of the Corresponding

Societies of the British Association were also on that of the Yorkshire

Union. Mr. Knubley replied that the Leeds Naturalists' Club, Leeds

Geological Association, and Malton Naturalists' Society were affiliated to

the Union, but not the Yorkshire Geological and Polytechnic Society, nor

the Yorkshire Philosophical Society.

     Mr. M. H. Mills then gave some account of the organisation of the

Federated Institution of Mining Engineers. He said that the rules of the

Federation had been carefully considered by the secretaries and councils

of the various societies composing it, and it had been found that the best

kind of federation was that which touched only the publication of their

papers. Each society did its work independently, as before the existence

of the Federation, but now they had one publication instead of many.

In answer to questions from Sir Douglas Galton, Mr. Mills added that he

thought it would be a good thing that societies doing the same kind of

work should be federated together ; he also stated that members of the

societies composing the Federation paid but one subscription, a portion of

it only being given to the Federation for printing the publication.

   Mr. Montagu Browne gave some details as tf> the present c )nstitutiou

of the Leicester Litei-aiy and Philosophical Society. With regard to

payments for printing, he said that usually each section was self-

supporting, liut that in the case of papers of exceptional interest and

expense, the parent society made a special grant, if necessary.
    Mr. C. E. De Ranee was glad to learn that the Yorkshire Union had

established a Coast Erosion Committee to carry on the work in Yorkshire,

which had been done for so many yeai-s by a British Association Com-

mittee for the country generally. As regards Mr. Abbott's plan, he

fully concurred with him as to the need for an organising secretary,

without whose aid he felt sure that scarcely any federation would be

accomplished.

                                                                                                                                                d2
36 REPORT-- 1896.

Mr. W. T. Hindmarsh said that while the Berwickshire Naturalists'

Club had a large area for its Held of work, extending not only over

Berwickshire, but over Northumberland, outside Newcastle there was no

large town or University within its boundaries. The district was sparsely

populated, and there was no other Naturalists' Club in it with which they

could unite.

Mr. J. H. Merivale thought, from some remarks of the last speaker,

that he did not quite realise that federation did not imply the slightest

loss of independence on the part of any local society joining a union.

The great advantage was that the transactions of all the local societies

were to be found in one publication. .He was certain that if the Natural

History Societies throughout the kingdom would unite as the societies

composing the Federated Mining Engineers had done, the result would

be excellent.

Professor T. Johnson mentioned that in Ireland they had a good

example of a Union. It comprised four clubs, one in Dublin, another in

Belfast, a third in Cork, and a fourth in Limerick, which combined to
Aform the Irish Field Club Union.
                                   yearly meeting was held in various

parts of the country, and they had a publication which was common

--property the ' Irish Naturalist.' There was a poll-tax of twopence irom

each member to defray the expenses of the Union, and there was a com-

mittee formed of the president and secretaries of the four societies. They

had an arrangement hy which a specialist belonging to one club could

have his expenses paid if he lectured to another club. They were also

forming a directory, so that students coming to Ireland would shortly bo

able to learn who was working at any given subject and where he might

be found. They made a point of sending their specimens to museums.

In addition, they had short courses of lectures to arouse the intei-est of

amateurs, with occasional excursions. The Union had been originated by

Mr. Praeger, secretary of the Dublin Club.

In answer to a question from the Chairman, Professor Johnson added

that the fees received from persons attending the lectures were put into a

common fund and used for excursion purposes, the lecturer himself re-

ceiving nothing from the course.

     Mr. Eli Sowerbutts thought that while in some respects federation
must commend itself to all, there were some questions of great delicacy

involved in it which made him hesitate to come to any decision at that

meeting. He felt sure that a society would not submit to' be controlled

by another society as regards the publication of its papers. There were

also many other matters needing careful discussion before any decision

could be safely arrived at.

Much discussion then arose as to the possibility of arranging for a

meeting for the further consideration of Mr. Abbott's paper before the

second meeting of the Conference. In this the Chairman, Sir Douglas

Galton, Professor Johnson, Mr. Abbott, Mr. Watts, Mr. Tate, and others

took part. At length the following motion was proposed by Mr. Abbott,

seconded by the Rev. E. P. Knubley, and carried unanimously :

     ' That Mr. Montagu Browne, Professor Johnson, the Rev. E. 'P.

Knubley, Mr. Hindmarsh, Mr. W. W. Watts, and Mr. Abbott be nomi-

nated to form a sub-committee (with power to add to their number) to

consider this question, and report to the Conference of Delegates of

Corresponding Societies.'

Mr. W. Watts inquired whether anything was being done to preserve
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  37

the publications of the local societies. The Chairman replied that many

pounds had been spent in binding those sent to the British Association
Office, and that it was proposed to index them if funds could be obtained

for that purpose.

     The meeting·;o then terminated.

                            Meeting of the Sub-committee.

   A meeting of the sub-committee was held in the Crown Court on

Monday, September 21. The Rev. T. R. R. Stebbing and Mr. O. W.

Jeffs were added to the sub-committee.

Report of Sub-comviittee appointed at Meeting of Delegates of Corre-
     sponding Societies, September 17, 1896 {Chairman, Rev. T. R. R.
      Stebbing, F.R.S.).

     The following resolutions have been unanimously agreed to :

     (1) That Mr. G. Abbott's paper on 'District Unions of Natural
History Societies ' be distributed by the Commit</ee of the Corresponding
Societies amongst all the Natural History Societies in the United King-
dom, with the request that their opinion on the feasibility of the plan
advocated in the paper be communicated as early as jiossible to the
Corresponding Societies Committee for their report to the next Conference

of Delegates.

     (2) That the formation of District Unions of Natural History
Societies is highly desirable, and would be of general advantage.

     (3) That the Committee of the Corresponding Societies be requested
to take steps to encourage the formation of District Unions of Natural
History Societies.

     (4) That it should be distinctly understood that the formation of

Unions would not in any way prevent the affiliation of individual

Societies of such Unions to the British Association as at present.

            Liverpool, Second Conference, September 22, 1896.

     The Second Conference was held in the Small Concert Room, St.
George's Hall, Dr. Garson in the chair.

     The Chairman called upon Mr. Abbott to read the Report of the sub-
committee appointed at the last Conference. [Mr. Abbott then read the

resolutions given above.]

    Mr. De Ranee expressed his satisfaction with the outcome of the Sub-

committee's deliberation. The more our local societies could combine for

pui-poses of publication the better. He moved that the Report be

received.

    Mr, Hembry seconded the motion.

     After some discussion, in which the Chairman, Mr. Sowerbutts, the
Rev. J. O. Bevan, and others took part, the Report was received. Some
further discussion took place as to the adoption of the Report, which was
moved by Mr. Abbott and seconded by Mr. Hembry. Tlie Report was at
length adopted, and a resolution was also passed referring the Report to
the Corresponding Societies Committee.
38 REPORT-- 1896.

   A delegate having inquired when the next Conference would take

place, the Chairman replied that it would be next year at Toronto.
     The following Paper by Professor Flinders Petrie was then read :

                On a Federal Stafffor Local Museums.

The present suggestions only affect a distribution of laboui', and will

rather economise than require extra expenditure.

     In all local museums the main difficulty of the management is that
there is neither money nor work enough for a highly trained and competent
man. It is in any case impossible to get a universal genius who can deal
with every class of object equally well, and hardly any local museum can
afford to pay for a first-class curator on any one subject. These difficulties
are entirely the result of a want of co-operation.

     According to the i-eport of the Committee in 1887, there are fifty-six
1st class, fifty-five 2nd class, sixty-three 3rd class, and thirty 4th class
museums in the kingdom. Setting aside the last two classes as mostly too
poor to pay except for mere caretaking, there are 111 in the other classes;
and deducting a few of the 1st class museums as being fully provided,
there are 100 museums, all of which endeavour to keep up to the mark by

.spending perhaps 30Z. to 200^. a year on a curator.

The practical course would seem to be their union, in providing a

federal staff, to circulate for all purposes requiring .skilled knowledge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

leaving the permanent attention to each place to devolve on a mere
caretaker. If half of these 1st and 2nd class museums combined in

paying 30^. a year each, there would be enough to pay three first-rate

men 500/. a year apiece, and each museum would have a week of atten-

tion in the year from a geologist, and the same from a zoologist and an

archaeologist.

The duties of such a stafl' would be to arrange and label the new

.specimens acquired in tlie past yeai", taking sometimes a day, or perhaps a

fortnight, at one place ;  to advise  on  alterations  and  improvements                                                  to
                                                                                                                       ;

recommend purchases required to fill up gaps ; to note duplicates and

promote exchanges between museums ; and to deliver a lecture on the

principal novelties of their own subject in the past year. Such visitants,

if well selected, would probably be welcome guests at the liouses of some

of those interested in the museum in each place.
     The effect at the country museums would be that three times in the

year a visitant would arrive for one of the three sections, would work

everytliing up to date, stir the local interests by advice and a lecture,
stimulate the caretaker, and- arrange routine work that could be carried

out before the next year's visit, and yet would not cost more than having
down three lecturers for the local institution or society, apart from this

work.

To many, perhaps most, museums 30/. for skilled work, and 30/. or

40/. for a caretaker, would be an economy on their present expenditure,

while they would get far better attention. Such a system could not be

suddenly started ; but if there were an official base for it, curators could

interchange work according to their specialities, and as each museum post
fell vacant it might be placed in commission among the best curators in
that district, until by gradual selection the most competent men were
attached to forty or fifty museums to be served in rotation. It is not im-

possible that the highest class of the local museums might be glad to
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  39

subscribe, so as to get special attention on subjects outside of the studies

of their present curators.

     The Chairman was sure that the meeting felt much obliged to Professor

Petrie for this very suggestive paper. He hoped that gentlemen

wishing to discuss it would be as brief as possible in their comments, as

they had much business before them.
    Mr. W. E. Hoyle said that he had no legal locus standi there, but had

come on the suggestion of the Assistant General Secretary, who had sent
him a copy of Professor Petrie's paper, and asked him to take part in the

discussion. He hoped no action would be taken in this matter in such a

way as to prevent co-operation with the Museums Association. Professor
Petrie's scheme seemed to him a most simple and practical one, and he

thought it would be a good thing for those specially interested in it to

confer with the officials of the Museums Association with regard to it.
The chief difficulty which he foresaw in carrying it out was the almost
incredible inertia of museum committees. The Museums Association met
once a year, and everyone who had attended its meetings had admitted
their value in enabling curators to exchange ideas upon all museum
questions. It had been in existence about six years, but hitherto very

few societies had cared to go to the expense of sending their curators to

its meetings. In the museum over which he had the honour to preside
there were four assistant curators who were doing good work. It was
probably not in Professor Petrie's mind when he drew up his scheme for a
Fedei-al staff. Yet he was quite prepared to urge upon his Committee the

adoption of Professor Petrie's plan.

     Mr. M. H. Mills could testify to the thoroughness with which museum
questions were discussed at meetings of the Museums Association. If his
proposition were in order, he would move that this question be referred to
the Museums Association.

      The Chairman thought Mr. Mills' proposition inadmissible.
      Mr. G. Abbott cordially supported Professor Petrie's suggestions, and
thought that an increase in the number of Unions of Naturalists' Societies

would greatly tend towards their general adoption.
     Mr. N. M. Richardson did not think there could be any doubt as to

the advantages of Professor Petrie's scheme, though he was afraid that the

Committee of the Dorset County Museum were hardly in a position to

incur the expense.

     Professor Johnson thought it would be a good thing if the Museums

Association could become a Corresponding Society of the British Associa-

tion, so that one or more of its chief officials might be present at discus-

sions of this kind. He had listened with considerable interest to Professor

 Petrie's paper, but he would protest strongly against the suggestion that
the curators of our local museums should be converted into mere care-

 takers, as he thought the tendency should be in the opposite direction.
 It would be well to urge our local societies to employ as their curator a
 specialist of some kind, and to give him a chance of rising above the

 position he held at first, rather than to make him feel that he would
 always be a mere caretaker dependent wholly on some one who came

down occasionally from some centre of enlightenment. He knew an

 admirable curator in the north of Ireland, seventy years of age, and a
 specialist in three or four branches, who was then living on a salary of
 70?. per annum, and had to dust the tables, open the door, and act in
40 REPORT-- 1896,

general as a mere caretaker. This was a disgrace to the great town in
which the museum was situated. Local museums should have a grant of
.50/. to 1001., or even 150/. for the payment of specialists.

    Professor J. W. Carr was inclined to regret that Professoj' Petrie's
paper had not been read before the Museums Association. Mr. Hoyle
(who, like the speaker, was a member of the Council of the Museums

Association) had not mentioned that some years ago a sub-committee was
appointed by that Association to report upon a suggestion much resem-

bling that of Professor Petrie. No definite result had, however, been
arrived at. He thought that if Professor Petrie were now to bring this

paper before the notice of the Museums Association the weight of his

authority might produce more important effects. He regretted the

absence of delegates from the Museums Association to discuss this ques-

tion.

     The Chairman remarked that any society might apply to be placed on

the list of Corresponding Societies. He hoped the delegates would give a
Hefull account of this discussion to the societies they represented.

called upon Profe.ssor Petrie to reply.
     Profe.ssor Petrie said that this was to a great extent a money question.

He did not think that his suggestions necessarily involved additional
expense. He thought it would be better that the money should be divided

between the mere caretaker and the specialists, rather than that an

attempt should be made to combine them by employing one man who

could not possibly be a specialist on all points. Indeed, those curators

who were more than mere caretakers would by his plan receive a larger
amount of money than before by rendering their services in a number of

places, instead of being confined to one. It would be better to have a

dozen men of science and fifty caretakers than sixty curators, all receiving

a very inadequate salary.

   A vote of thanks to Professor Petrie for his paper having been passed,

the Chairman invited remarks from any representatives of the various
sections of the British Association who wished for the co-operation of the
Corresponding Societies in any work.

                                                  Section C.

     Mr. W. "VV. Watts said that, though the labours of some of the
Committees nominated by Section C had come to an end, the Geological

Photographs Committee was still in existence. Though much assistance
had been received from Leicestershire and some other places, a very large
area was still unphotographed. The eastern counties had sent very
few photographs. The Erratic Blocks Committee still existed, and their
work was being largely done by the committees of local societies. Some

 societies in Yorkshire were doing most admirable work. Those were the

two chief committees of Section C which needed the co-operation of the

 local societies.

     Mr. C. E. De Ranee made some remarks on the labours of the Under-

 ground Waters Committee of the British Association. Though the
 Committee had ceased to exist, he hoped the delegates of the Corresponding
 Societies assembled there would urge on their members to record carefully
 in their districts everything bearing on that matter, not only as regards
 the geological nature of the strata, but also as to the tempera-
ture of water obtained from considerable depths. As to the Erratic
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  41

Blocks Committee, he wished to point out how much work had been done
in that department by members of the GlaciaHsts' Association.

                                                Section H.

     Mr. Sidney Hartland wished to ask for the co-operation of the local
societies in the work of the Ethnographical Survey Committee. Consider-

able progress had been made in the work of the Committee since he had

asked their aid at Ipswich last year. Many measurements of the natives

of Galloway had been taken by Dr. Macgregor. During the present
century the movements of our population had been immensely greater
than in previous centui'ies. Still there were places where there had been

little change in that respect. As it was the object of the Committee to

acquire a knowledge of the distinguishing characteristics of the various
races of British Isles, it was important that the measurements, &c., of
individuals in any district should be those of persons whose families had
lived there during a considerable period. Dr. Macgregor had accordingly
been careful to select persons whose pedigrees could be traced back a

century or more. He had also collected much of the folklore of the

district. There was no department in which it was more desirable to

have speedy information than that of folklore. Much had been done

with regard to the dialects of the different counties of England by the
publication of the English Dialect Dictionary, but in Scotland and Ireland
there was still much work to be done both in dialect and in folklore.
Education, facilities for railway travelling, and industrial migrations were
rapidly destroying local customs, dialects, and traditions, so that it was
more important that speedy information about them should be obtained
than that there should be an immediate supply of physical measurements.
The historic and prehistoric monuments of a locality should also be noted.
Mr. Hartland concluded by remarking that he would be glad to furnish
any delegates interested in the subject with copies of the Ethnographical
Committee's Schedules, or with any help in his power.

     Mr. John Gray, Buchan Field Club, said that in his district they had
begun to note the physical characteristics of the inhabitants by placing
themselves at the entrance to a field where some sports were being held,
and observing the colour of the eyes and hair, the contour of the nose,
and other characteristics of people entering the field. They also measured
about 200 persons in the grounds, and obtained some very interesting
results. In addition they had obtained measurements, itc, of almost all

the school children of the district.

     The Chairman remarked that Mr. Gray's Society was obtaining

excellent results, and giving an example of the work required. As the

information asked for by the Ethnographic Survey Committee was of so
many different kinds, it appeared to him that the formation of sub-
committees by the local societies would greatly expedite the work. One
sub-committee might confine itself to physical measurements, another to
dialect and folklore, a third to ancient monuments, and so on. Then
photographers were needed for illustrations of people and monuments.

And persons with a turn for history might consider the historical evidence

of continuity of race. Investigations of this kind would at once enrich
the Transactions of a local society, and help the work of the British

Association.

     The meeting then adjourned.

G --Calculation of the
                  (r, v)-Tiitefjrah. Preliminary JR-eport of the

Committee, consifitinri of llev. Robert Harley (Chairman), Pro-

fessor A. R. Forsyth (Secretary), Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher,

Professor A. Lodge, and Professor Karl Peakson. (Dranm vj) by

Professor Karl Pearson.)

Preliminary Bejwrt on the Integral G (r, >)=: sin'd e^'^ d6.

G1. The integral  (r, r) occurs in the determination of frequency

curves and of the probable errors of their constants under the form

Ge-i^" (r, )), or, what is the same thing, the integral

                          f  t/2

                                  cos' d e-"^ dd
                             - TT :

occurs. The calculation of this integral for the values of r, which most
frequently arise in practice, is for special cases somewhat laborious, and
this much impedes the use of the generalised frequency curves by statisti-
cians and biologists.' It seems desirable, accordingly, to form tables of tlie
values of the integral for the most usual values of rand r. If tan (/)=)'/r,

then r=2 to r:=50, and <^=0° to <^=90° are the ranges of values which

experience has shown to he most useful for statistical purposes. For the
same purposes it is not necessary to calculate to a greater degree of

exactitude than 1 in 1,000. Hence, if a table of double entry be formed

proceeding by units from r=l to ?'=.50, and by degrees from (f>=0° to

^=90°, intermediate values of r and <^ will be given with sufficient

accuracy by interpolation ; such a table will contain 4,500 entries, and
involves a large amount of labour in its calculation.

    GThe integral (r, >) is, however, of considerable interest from the

standpoint of pure mathematics,'- and is not unlikely to be required for a

variety of investigations, as it is closely related to the Eulerian integrals.

Hence the formuhe of this report and the scheme of the proposed tables

are adapted to expansion, should it be found ultimately of service to form

Gas complete a table for (r, i) as exists for V (x).

     2. The value of the integral may be expressed in terms of Eulerian

integrals with complex arguments {see Forsyth, Quarterly Journal of
Matliematics, 1895). Thus :

\' / TTi(/^lr^i+ll-hli,,-)\T-n(/l^.r. +,l1.+ h>i)                   (i-)

                  ·ei'^"             1                                        ,.. s

                  r+1 B(^r+l-^ri,^r+l+^ri)                          . (u.)

      Since e i^" is the mid-value of sin'r^ e^^, it is very roughly proportional

Gto the value of (r, i), and accordingly e-^'^" G(?-, i)=F (r, r) will be
found to change more uniformly and Ggradually than (r, r), and as this

     ' See a paper on ' Skew Variation in Homogeneous Material,' Phil. Trans.,
vol. 186 A, pp. 377-380. A further memoir on the probable errors of frequency

Gconstants also largely involves the values of (r, v).
    G' Professor Klein, I am told, has d^awn the attention of bis students to (r, vy

in unpublished lectures, and has suggested to them its fuller consideration.
                                                                                   ^)

                ON CALCULATION OF THE G (r, i/)-INTEGRALS.                                  71

Fis the quantity actually required in statistical problems, it is (r, i),

which will be tabulated. Interpolation between two values of F (r, i
Ggives better results for (r, r) than direct interpolation between two

Gvalues of (r, r).

     It has been shown by Lipschitz (Crelle : Bd. 56, S. 20) that the well-

known expansion in        terms             of    Bernoulli's  numbers        for  rlog  (ii -(- 1) still

holds when n is a complex quantity ; the remainder after ^^m-i is

                       /        '"                R, + ,               1

where e and e' are both less than unity.

   We can accordingly use this expansion to obtain a semi-convergent

Fseries for (r, v).

                               -log T{\r + \+\vi).

separately,

and the series will be semi-convergent, if r>2, as it always is in statistical

mproblems. Throughout is to be summed for all integer values from to

oo, and the logarithms are to Napier's base.

    F GThe results (iii.) and (iv.) allow us to calculate and(;·, i ) (?·, r) to

any degree of accuracy that may be i-equired. If we stop at the m"' term

in X ('} <^) then the error in the value of x (''j </>) will be less tlian

     Now, if ?'=2, we ought to stop at x; to get the closest result from our
semi-convergent series. AVe shall then make an error of less than 6 in

the 10,000. Such a result is generally close enough for statistical

practice, but is hardly sufficient for the purposes of pure mathematics.

=However, if we start with r 4, and proceed only to the fourth term,

X7, we should obtain results only showing error in the sixth place of

decimals. If we calculate x (>', ') up to xa, we have an error less than
·000002 for r=4, and less errors for larger values of r. Finally, if we

r--limit ourselves to values of                                                                                              or < 6, we shall find that by proceeding to xt

only we have errors of. less than -0000003 in our results. As the tables

of logarithms and trigonometrical functions in general use do not go

beyond seven figures, it does not seem necessary for practical purposes to

go beyond xt in the calculation of the x-functions. If we, then, start

our tables with r=6, we shall obtain results for x (?', ') certainly correct to

the sixth figure. The earlier portion of the table may then be calculated

from the formula of reduction :

and the entire tables will then be correct to the sixth place.

     3. It may be observed that the formula (iv.) is of considerable signifi-

cance. It is quite independent of the nature of r, whether fi-actional or
integer, and thus shows that there is no abrupt change in the value of

G (r,>) when we pass from integer to fractional values. Jt thus justifies

interpolation between integer values of r, in order to find the value of
the function for r fractional. It might be supposed, if for statistical
purposes it is sufficiently accurate to interpolate between integer values

Gof r, and as (r, i) is directly integrable in a terminable series ' when r

is integer, that to use this latter series would be the readiest means of

Gcalculating tables of (?·, j). But this is far from being the case, and for

the following reasons :

    We(i.) have always as many terms to calculate as in finding x (>', f),

and often many more.
     (ii.) These terms are not the same for all values of <p, and must be

calculated afresh for each pair of values of (p and rj i.e., they cannot be
broken up into ^-factors and 7--factors, and the former and latter calculated

independently and once for all.

    GHence, even when r is an integer the calculation of (r, i ) proceeds

best by aid of the x-functions.

   --4. The process of calculation has accordingly been the following :

     (a) The calculation of a table of x-functions from xi to X: for values
of <p from 0^ to 90°. This table will be found at the end of this paper, and,

until the complete tables of F (r, r) are ready, will enable the value of
F (?-, )) for any value of r and r to be found with a fairly small amount

of labour.

(b) Very considerable progress has been made with the calculation of

F (r, J') from the x-functions for selected values of r. It is proposed to
Afill in the gaps by means of the reduction formula (v.).
                                                                              test of the

accuracy of the calculations will thus be obtained by the agreement of the

directly calculated values with those obtained by reduction from the last

directly calculated value.

    The arithmetic has proved much more laborious than was at all
anticipated at the start. It was originally undertaken by Mr. H. J.

Harris, assistant to Professor M. J. M. Hill at University College,
London, but the whole of the calculations have been again and indepen-
dently worked out by members of the Department of Ai:)plied Mathematics

in that College.

5. It seems desirable to illustrate the method of calculation, and to

show, in one case at any rate, the degree of accuracy obtainable by inter-

polating    between  integer values of r and values of     proceeding by

                                                        <j)

and 21°. The values of x might be taken at once from our table, but the
method of calculation is illustrated by calculating them ab initio. The

following are the logarithmic values of the ^'s to base 10 :

    log xi=2-9208188 + log (-250000-008 cos./))

    log x3=3-44.36975 + log (-062500-005 ·> cos 3|))

    ^log X7=l-7746907 + log (-003906,(25)-cos cos 7^).

These are obtained by inserting the values of the Bernoulli numbers.' In
the case of the trigonometrical quantity in the argument of the last
logarithm being greater than the numerical constant, care must be taken
to make the corresponding x negative.

    Thus we see that if tables of F (?-, qi), proceeding by units and degrees,
are calculated, the value of F (9-35, 20° 35'), as found by interpolation

from the tables or direct calculation, would only difter by two units in the
fifth place of figures. Such a degree of approximation is more than

sufficient for practical purposes in statistics. Had we used values of the

x's correct to the seventh place of figures and used second differences, our
results would have agreed to the sixth place of figui-es. Should this not

suffice for the nioi-e exact purposes of pure mathematics, our table would

still serve as a skeleton to be filled in at smaller intervals of the

variables, when necessity arises.

contribute no sensible portion up to the sixth place of decimals. They

tion from a table of \'s proceeding by degrees. The tables of the

reasonably demand the completion of the F (r, r) tables themselves.

Dr. C. E. CuUis, and Mr. Karl Pearson, and the independent values
thus obtained used for the verification and correction of the tables
originally pi-ovided by Mr. H. F. Harris.

     The figures in brackets will generally only be required to determine

the accurate seventh figure in the value of the x-function or its differences.

The differences in the higher values of x have been found by calculating

X to eleven figures and then dropping the last two. On this account it

will be found that the tabulated differences do not in the bracketed figures
always agree in the last place with the results obtained by subtracting
the tabulated x's-

ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL PHYSICAL LABORATORY, 83

University Colleges aftbrd for i-esearch are much reduced by the large
demands usually made upon the time and energy of the Professor and the
staff for elementary teaching. Nor is a thorough appreciation of the

essential connection between reseai'ch and all higher scientific education
so widely diffused in England as it is in Germany, in the United States,
and elsewhere.

It must be manifest that the cure for this latter evil is not to be

found in the establishment of a National Laboratory, but in such a

change of public opinion as will make it possible to reproduce in England

the conditions which have long obtained elsewhere. It is to be hoped

that the research work now conducted at educational establishments in

Wethis country will largely increase in the future.  should earnestly

deprecate any divorce between higher teaching and investigation, and

should regard anything tending in that direction as a retrograde step.
     There are, however, investigations of particular types which have

been recognised both in this country and abroad as lying outside the

range of effort possible either to an individual or to a great teaching

institution.

    These may be divided into three principal classes, viz.

     (1) The observations of natural phenomena, the study of which must be
prolonged through periods of time longer than the average duration of life

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

     (2) The testing and verification of instruments for physical investi-
gation, and the preservation of standards for reference ; and

     (3) The systematic accurate determination of physical constants and

of numerical data which may be useful either for scientific or industrial

purposes.

   A laboratory for such purposes would aid and would not compete with

laboratories maintained by individuals or institutions for more general
physical research, and the reasons for establishing it as a National Insti-
tution are much of the same kind as those for maintaining a National
Astronomical Observatory.

     If England is to keep pace with other countries in scientific progress,
it is essential that such an institution should be provided ; and this can
scarcely be maintained continuously on an adequate scale, except as a
national laboratory supported mainly by Government.

     In a paper read at Ipswich on the Reichsanstalt, it was suggested

that the Kew Observatory might be extended so as to afford a satisfac-

tory nucleus for a national physical laboratory.

    The Kew Observatory, endowed by the late Mr. Gassiot with an

income that is now somewhat less than 500/. a year, is under the control
and management of an unpaid committee appointed by the Council of

the Royal Society. It is the central observatory of the Meteorological
Office, from which it i-eceives 400/. a year ; and it has gradually become
an important standardising institution, as Avell as a recognised base station

for observations in meteorology and terrestrial magnetism. Its gross
income from these various sources is now somewhat less than 3,000/. a year ;
but the greater part of this is derived from testing fees, and is almost
entirely absorbed in working expenses. The Observatory is, however, at
the present time in a thoroughly sound financial position.

Richmond, and is the property of the Government, from whom the Com-

mittee hold it at a small rent. They have latterly been permitted to add
about five acres to their holding.

     The work of the Observatory is very varied, but may be roughly

divided into

   --(1) Routine observation magnetic, meteorological, and solar.

     (2) Experimental work connected with the routine observations and
research work generally.

      (3) Standardising of between thirty and forty different kinds of
instruments, whose number in the gross amounted to 23,000 last year.

     The general heads under which most of these instruments fall are

     (a) Thermometers of all kinds.
     (b) Barometers, anemometers, and all sorts of meteorological apparatus.
      (c) Theodolites, sextants, artificial horizons, compasses, and telescopes.
     (d) Watches and chronometers.
      (e) Photographic lenses.

      Particulars will be found in the annual reports, printed in the
'Proceedings of the Royal Society.'.

     The present work of the Observatory is therefore of a character which
is strictly consistent with a large portion of the work which would find

a place in a national physical laboratory.

    Having thus briefly shown what the Kew Observatory now performs,

it will be convenient to consider what would be

     (a) The function which a national laboratory should fulfil.
     (b) The system which should be adopted for its control and management.

   --(a) Functions. In addition to the special research work, the scope of

which we have already partially indicated, the work of the proposed
institution would include an extension of certain branches of work now

performed by the Kew Observatory. This work has now for its object

the verification of standards for instruments of utility in scientific investi-
gation, but it hardly attempts investigation into the properties of the

materials of which they are, or should be, composed. An enlargement

of this work to its proper extent would in the case of many delicate

standards relieve British investigators from their present dependence
upon foreign laboratories. Indeed, in the prosecution of research the
necessity for accurate standards is being daily more and more felt. This
class of work, as recognised in the Reichsanstalt, comprises, not only com-
parisons of length, weight, capacity, gravity, sound, light, etc., but varia-
tions of conditions due to temperature, vibrations, or other causes, as well
as quality of materials in regard to their uses. It is a class of work
which is not touched by the Standards Department of the Board of Trade,
for this department is restricted by Act of Parliament to the work of
making standards of length, weight, and capacity, and of such electrical

--quantities as may be of use for trade.

    (b) Afanagement. The present form of government of the Kew

Observatory affords a basis upon which the management of the extended
laboratories might be safely founded. The present government is by a
paid superintendent, who is controlled by an unpaid committee appointed
under the Council of the Royal Society. The Committee consists of the
 eading authorities on the special subjects which form the present work
0T< THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL PHYSICAL LABORATORY 85

of tlie laboratory, and they lay down the general lines on which investi-

gations are to go on. It would appear to be desirable that the government

of the enlarged Institution should be in the hands of a Committee

appointed either as now by the Royal Society alone or in conjunction

with one or more of the chief scientific bodies in the country. But it is

to be hoped that in addition to this Council of Advice tJie immediate

executive and initiative power would vest in a paid chief or Director of

the utmost eminence attainable. Unless such an appointment were

made, either an altogether unfair amount of work would be thrown upon

some members of the governing committee, of the institution would fail

to rise to the highest usefulness.

    The present accommodation at Kew Observatory is quite insufficient

for the proposed extension of its work · and to carry out the idea suggested

will require inci-eased space, increased buildings, and increased staff.

There would probably be no difficulty in obtaining fi-om the Govei'n-

ment an extension of space out of the park at Richmond ; but the pro-
posal would entail an expenditure of money for new buildings. It would

be unfortunate if such expenditure had to be taken from the small fund

which Parliament allots to scientific research under the Royal Society, but

there can be little doubt that when a satisfactory scheme has been

elaborated it will not be unreasonable to ask the Government to assist

in providing the necessary buildings.

Additions to buildings require much consideration, and, therefore, as

a preliminary to any action a small committee might be asked to draw up

Kewa detailed scheme, with the aid of an architect, for an extension of

Observatory, having regard to the site and to utilising the present

erections upon it.

     Since it is difficult to foresee the direction in which a i-apidly growing

subject like Physics may develop, it is probably wisest to begin with

buildings of an adaptable and not too elaborate character, and to stock

them with but a moderate supply of the best available apparatus. In

such a subject as Physics a large annual maintenance grant is more

useful than an extravagant initial equipment which might speedily

Webecome antiquated.  would suggest to those whose business it may

be hereafter to approach the Government that some such sum as 20,000^.

or 25,000^. would serve to erect a building sufficient for all immediate

necessities, and that posterity may be left to increase it as need arises.

A sum of 5,000^. would provide a fair amount of initial instrumental

equipment of a permanent kind, and the rest should be met out of an

annual grant.

The commercial testing department may be considered self-supporting,

but for secular research and the determination of constants considerable

expense would be entailed. This would fall under the heads of salaries,

new apparatus, maintenance, warming, lighting, and taxes.

   We propose that the head of this National Laboratory should receive

1,200Z. a year, and we estimate that an annual grant, in addition to the
sum at present expended, of 5,000(!. per annum, and an initial expenditure

of 30,000^. for buildings and equipment, would do all that is essential to

carry out the scheme in a wise and worthy manner.

--Uniformity/ of Size of Pages of Scientific Societies' Publications.

     Peport of the Committee, consisting of Professor Silvanus P.
     Thompson {Chairman), Dr. G. H. Bryan, Dr. C. V. Burton,

    Mr. E. T. Glazebrook, Professor A. W. Rucker, Dr. G. John-

     stone Stoney, Mr. James Swinburne {Secretary).

Your Committee has prepared a circular for distribution to the various

learned societies and academies, pointing out the desirability of all pro-
ceedings and transactions being issued in one or other of the standard
sizes recommended in the British Association report of last year.

    Upon the printing and postage of this circular, which will be dis-

tributed early in the winter session, the balance of the Association's
grant will be expended.

   A proposal having been made by the Council of the Royal Society last

year to change the sizes of its 'Proceedings' and 'Transactions' to royal
8vo, thus not only spoiling the historic continuity of its publications, but
UNIFORMITY OF SIZE OF PAGES OF SOCIETIES' PUBLICATIONS. 87

departing from the already existing uniformity of the majority of British
pubUcations, the Chairman of your Committee addressed a remonstrance
against the taking of such a step. Happily any further action was
rendered needless by the resohe of the Council not to persist in the

suggested change.

     Of the publications which at the present time depart from the
standard sizes proposed in the report of last year, the most important are
the ' Sitzungsberichte der Berliner Akademie der Wissenscliafteii ' and the
' Atti della Beale Accademia dei Lincei,' which cannot be bound witli
either quarto or octavo publications of the ordinary size.

     Your Committee desires reappointment without further grant.

--Comparison of MarfneHc Insfriiments. Report of the Committee, con-

    sisting 0/ Professor A. W. Rucker (Chairman), Mr. W. Watson

     (Secretari/), Professor A. Schuster, and Professor H. H. Turner,

     appointed to confer irith the Astronomer Royal and Hie Superin-

      tendents of other Observatories ivith reference to the Compariso7i

     of Magnetic Standard's with a view of carrying out such Com-

      parison.

The work of comparing the magnetic instruments in the different mag-

netic observatories of the United Kingdom was carried out by Professor

Riicker and Mr. Watson during the summer of 189.5.

Unfortunately, however, nothing could be done at Greenwich. The

peculiar form of the declination needle in use there makes it impossible

Ato place another instrument on the same site.  good deal of iron and

a dynamo (carefully shielded by a triple iron case) have recently been

introduced into the Observatory, and it is doubtful whether, if another

position were choseii in the Observatory grounds, the differences measured

might not include some erroi's due to the presence of these causes of

magnetic disturbance.

The authorities of the Observatory hope that it may be possible to

arrange for the establishment of a new magnetic Observatory in the

Park, and it is most desirable that when this is done the instruments in

use at Greenwich and at Kew should be compared.

     The work of the Committee has therefore been limited to the com-

parison of the Kew standards with the instruments in use at Falmouth,

Stonyhurst, and Valentia. The Committee have learned with mych regret

that the magnetic observations at Valentia have now been discontinued.

The extreme westerly position of that station makes it one of the most

important in Europe for determining the relation between the rate of

secular change and geographical position. It is much to be desired that

funds may be forthcoming by means of which the work may be resumed

and placed on a more permanent footing.

The work of the Falmouth Observatory is also hampered by want of

funds. Other buildings ai-e now being erected near to it, and the

purchase of a small plot of land, to maintain the isolation which is

desirable, is an urgent need. The vertical force-recording instrument

has never worked properly, and appears to want expensive alterations.

The observations made by the superintendent, Mr. E. Kitto, are of a

very high order of excellence, and it is to be hoped that the Royal

Cornwall Polytechnic Society, by which the Observatory was founded,
                --  --

--88 REPORT 1896.

will be able to ensure the maintenance of the magnetic observations

under the best conditions.
     The instruments used in the comparisons which have been carried out

are magnetometer No. 70, by Messrs. Elliott Brothers, and dip circle
No. 94, by Dover. They had been used in the recent magnetic survey
of the United Kingdom, and are indicated hereafter, as in the published
account of that survey, by the letter S.

    They were in the first place compared again with the Kew standards
at Kew by Professor Riicker. Some changes had been made in No. 70,
so that the differences with Kew are not strictly comparable with those

which have previously been published. In the case of the dip circle the

results were in satisfactory accord with earlier measurements.

     The method of comparison of the instruments was altered, so as to
diminish the risk of error from variation in the zeros of the self-recording^
instruments. To this end alternate sets of observations were made with
the instruments to be compared at short intervals on the same day, so

that the zero lines of the self-recording instruments, by which these
observations were reduced to the same time, could not have appreciably

altered (see ' Phil. Trans.,' 1896, 188, p. 11).

     After the instruments had been compared with those used in the
other observatories they were brought back to Kew, and a similar set o£
comparisons to that above described were made, chiefly by Mr. Watson.

     The results of the two sets of experiments are entered in the following

tables.

    As it was desirable to show that the Kew standard instruments

gave normal results when used by Professor Riicker and Mr. Watson,
observations were made with them by the Observatory officials on days
near those on which the comparisons were carried out, and the readings

for the zero lines of the self-registering instruments were determined so
as to serve as a check on the corresponding v.ilues obtained when the

survey instruments were compared with the standards. These observa-

tions are indicated by an asterisk.
     The most convenient way of making the comparison is as follows :

     Let Cq and C be the readings of the self-registering instruments at

the time when the value of the element was determined by the Kew

--standard (K) and No. 70 (S') respectively. Then K Cn=Zo and

-- C=ZS' are the values of the zero line of the self-registering instrument

according to the two observations. But if the observation with No. 70

had been made at the same instant as that with the Kew standard, and if

the zero line remained unaltered in the interval which actually occurred
between the two experiments, the simultaneous values of the element

Kgiven by the two instruments would have been and S=S'4-Co -- C-

 .·.K-S=K-Co-(S'-C)=Zo-Z.
    On October 12 the self-registering instruments at Kew were disturbed,

owing to some work which was being done in the room in which they are

placed.

     The Astronomer Royal was therefore good enough to supply us with
the values of the elements given by the Greenwich instruments at the

time of our observations at Kew, and by using these instead of Cq and C

the proper allowance for diurnal variation and disturbance could be

made.

     In the following tables the number of whole degrees in the values of
Zq and Z is omitted :

Hence the difference between the uncorrected value of the force, taken
without reference to diurnal variation, &c., and the mean of the curve
readings at the times of the two observations gives the reading corre-

sponding to the zero line of the instrument.

   KIf, then, we write and S' for H', and C,, and C for the correspond-

ing means of the curve readings, we have as before :

                        =K=Zn-f-C,|, S' Z + C

with No. 70 were interpolated between those made with the Kew instru-

ment, that with No. 70 on October 9 has been combined with tlie second

result obtained on October 10 with the Kew instrument.

These observations indicate that a small change took place in mag-

netometer No. 70 during the journeys to the other observatories. The

differences are not very great, and if we take the mean of the results
obtained in July and October, viz. -- 0'-4, for the difference in declination,

--and 0"00011 for that in horizontal force, the linal results will only be

affected with an uncertainty of rii0'-3 and ±0-00007 respectively.

In the case of the dip observations, experiments were either made

with each instrument alternately, or so that the mean time of two

observations made with one instrument was nearly the same as the mean

time of two corresponding observations made with the other. In this

Weway the effects of diurnal variation, ifec, were nearly eliminated.  also,

however, determined the dip at the time of each observation from the

self-registering records of the horizontal and vertical foi^ce.

    The means of six experiments made in July by the first method with

No. 94, and of a like number with the Kew instrument, wei'e 67° 23''8 and

67° 23'-6, so that the average result with No. 94 was 0'-2 higher.
     The means of five experiments with each instrument in October were

67° 23'-2 with No. 94 and 67° 22'-0 with the Kew standard, so that the

difference had apparently increased by a minute. It will be seen from the

above table that these results do not differ much from those obtained
when the comparison was made with the recording instruments, and that
therefore the method by which they were obtained, which was perforce

adopted at Falmouth, Stonyhurst, and Valentia, is sufficiently good for
the purpose in view.

     In the table each needle is treated separately. The mean of the

two differences obtained in July and October, viz. : y8=-- 0''6, is in

close accord with the values obtained in February and October, 1892,

when No. 94 was last compai'ed with Kew. They were -- 0'*4 and -- 0''5

respectively.

   Summing up the results obtained at Kew we get the following table :

--Mathematical Functions. Report of the Committee, consisting of

     Lord Kayleigh (Chairman), Lord Kelvin, Professor B. Price^

    Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher, Professor A. G. Greenhill, Professor
    W. M. Hicks, Professor P. A. MacMahon, Lieut.-Colonel Allai*
    jwCunningham, and J^rofessor A. Lodge (Secretary), ajypointed

      the imrpose of calcidatiiig Tables of certain Mathematical Functions,

     and, if necessarij, of taking steps to carry out the Calculations, and
     to puhlish the residis in an accessible form.

The first report of the Committee Avas made in 1889, when they pub-
lished tables of the Bessel Functions, l,,{x), for integral values of n front'

  to 11, from x-=0 to 6-0, at intervals of 0"2. The original intention had
been to calculate tables of 3,,{x) for various values of n, but in 188^
extensive tables of 3q{x) and 3J^a:) were published by Dr. Meissel of Kiel,
and it was therefore considered advisable to work at tables of l,,{x),
which had not previously been calculated, the two classes of functions,

--being connected by the equation .

                      l,{x)=i-^'3,:{ix).

In 1893 the report of the Committee contained a detailed table of

Ii(^k) from o:^0 to S'lOO, at intervals of '001, to nine decimal places, of
Awhich the last figure was approximate.
                                                short table of 3o[x-Ji) was-

also given, to nine decimal places, from ,);=:0 to 6-0 at intervals of 0*2.

The present table of  I,,(.x') is from x-=Q to  5-100, at  intervals  of  -001
                                                                                                   ,,

to nine decimal places, the last figure being approximate, being exactly on

the lines of the 1893 table of li{x).

The Committee desire to reconmiend that tables of the Bessel Function.';

be published by the Association to six decimal places, with a preface

giving some of their chief properties.

The Committee have considered a proposition made at the Ipswich

meeting last year by Colonel Cunningham, viz. that the British Asso-

ciation should be asked to undertake the publication of a ' New Canon

Arithmeticus ' which he had already nearly computed. Colonel Cunning-

ham undertook to prepare one copy at his own expense, and asked that

the British Association should pay the expense (about 2.5/.) of preparing^

a second copy and of having the two copies compared and checked ; one

copy to be Colonel Cunningham's property, one copy to be the property

of the Association ; the British Association to be asked also to pay the-
whole cost of printing and publication of the work in. a separate 4to.

volume (which would be of about same size as Jacobi's ' Canon Arith-

meticus 'j. Colonel Cunningham would undertake to superintend the-
whole work to completion, and to provide a preface descriptive of the

tables.

     Tha Committee propose to recominend the Association ultimately to

undertake the publication of Colonel Cunningham's ' New Canon Arith-

meticus ' as proposed by the author. They desire to be reappointed with
a grant of 2-")/. for the purpose of preparing a second copy of Colonel
Cunningham's table and of comparing and cliecking the two copies.

ELECTRICAL STANDARDS.                     151

    At the Ipswich Meeting of tlie Association the question of a standcard

thermal unit was referred to the Electrical Standards Committee, and has

been under their consideration during the year.
     After the Ipswich Meeting Mr. E. H. Griffiths sent the folloAving letter

to a number of physicists in various foreign countries, together with a copy

--of the paper ' he had communicated to the Association :

         Herewith I forward you a copy of a recent communication to the ' Philo-
   sophical Magazine,' in which I "have endeavoured to call attention to the
    unsatisfactory nature of our present system of thermal measurements.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            _

        At the Ipswich Meeticfr of the British Association the consideration of the
   question of a standard thermal unit was referred to the Electrical Standards

    Committee.

        As a member of tliat Committee I now approacli you with a request that
   you will communicate to me any sug-g-estions which you may regard as calculated

    to assist our deliberations on the subject.

       I am anxious to lay before the Committee the opinions of the leading
   authorities of all countries ; I trust, therefore, that you will favour me with

   some expression of vonr views, particularly as to the nature and magnitude
   of the thermal unit (if anv) that you would recommend for adoption.

         Unless you state that I am' to regard your rejily as ' for Committee only'
   or 'private,' I shall conclude that you have no objection to its publication.

         The importance of arriving (.if possible) at some general agreement regard-
    ing the thermal unit will, I hope, be accepted as a sufficient excuse for thus

    troubling you.

     Extracts from such replies as contain definite suggestions bearing on
the question of the unit of heat are printed in Appendix I. ; the letters
have been translated, and those which merely give general approval to

some such scheme as that outlined have not been included. No replies

were received adverse to the suggestion that an endeavour should be made
to secure common agreement in the matter.

     The concluding propositions of Mr. Griffiths' paper were substantially

as follows :

     (I.) To adopt as the theoretical unit of heat a multiple (42 xlO'^) of

the erg.

     (II.) To adopt as the practical unit of heat, the heat required to raise
1 gramme of water 1° C. of the nitrogen thermometer at some temperature
t° C. as given by that thermometer.

     (III.) To adopt provisionally some formula expressing the specific heat

of water in terms of the temperature over a range of, say, 10° C.

     If the numbei', 42 x 10*"' ergs, be adopted for the theoretical unit, then,
according to the experiments of Rowland, the theoretical and the practical
unit agree, provided that the temperature t° C. be 10° C.

     Mr. Griffiths, in the paper already referred to, has made a comparison
of the results obtained by Joule, Rowland, Schuster, Miculescu, and him-
self, for the amount of energy required to raise 1 gramme of water 1° C.
at various temperatures. The results differ according as the readings of
Joule's mercury thermometer are reduced to the scale of Rowland's air

thermometer, or to the scale of the nitrogen thermometer, as has been
done by Schuster.

     In the first case the mean values are

    At 10° C. (41-971±-023)xl0«; and at 15° C. (41-891±-023) xlO''

and in the second

    At 10° C. (41-958±-029) x 10« ; and at 15° C. (41-875±-029) x lO^.

     Tables of the values of the specific heat of water between 10° C.
and 20° C. have been calculated by Mr. Griffiths, and are given in
Appendix II.

     The Committee have made an analysis of those replies which contain

definite suggestions.
ELECTRICAL STANDARDS.  153

      Most of the writers wish to see some multiple of the erg adopted as
 the theoretical unit, but thei'e are differences of opinion as to the mul-

 tiple to be chosen.

     Thus, Professors Dorn and Wiillner, Dr. Chappuis, and Professor Ames

 would prefer 42 x 10*^ ergs. Professor Ostwakl, Professor Olszewski and
 his colleagues, and Professor Callendar suggest 10" ergs. Professor Planck
 and M. Le Chatelier suggest 10* ergs, or in the case of the latter, as an
 alternative, 5x10^.

      Professors Rowland and Nichols consider the ice unit as theoretically
 best ; the latter, however, would be willing to adopt 42 x lO*' ergs as tlie
 theoretical unit, while Pi'ofessor Rowland writes : ' From a practical stand-

 point, however, the unit depending on the specific heat of water is cei*-
 tainly the most convenient. It has been the one mostly used, and its

value is well known in terms of energy.'

      There is fairly general agreement in the view that as a practical unit

Cthe heat required to raise 1 gramme of water 1° at some lixed tempera-

 ture must be taken, but views differ as to the temperature which it is
 most convenient to choose.

      Mr. Griffiths suggested the nitrogen thermometer as the standard
 of temperature. The French physicists agree in the opinion that the
 hydrogen thermometer should bo adopted, and reasons are given for this
in the letters of M. Guillaume and M. Chappuis. The Committee concur

 in this view.

      The Committee are of opinion that Mr. Griffiths' paper, and the
replies received by him, show clearly that it is desii-able to come to an
agreement as to the definition of the unit of heat.

      They undei'stand that a Committee of the French Physical Society have

the question at present under consideration, and they hope it may be

possible for the Electrical Standards Committee of the British Association
to co-operate with this Committee and with representatives of other foreign

countries in the matter.

     The Standards Committee have provisionally approved the following
propositions, with the view of opening international discussion of the
question. They propose to send the propositions to representative bodies
throughout the world, with a letter stating that they have been provisionally
approved, inviting further discussion, and asking those bodies to take the
steps which seem to them most desirable in order to secure international
agreement on the matter.

   --Proposition I. For many purposes heat is most conveniently

measured in units of energy, and the theoretical C.G.S. unit of heat is
1 erg. The name Joule has been given by the Electrical Standards
Committee to 10^ «rgs.

    For many practical purposes heat will continue to be measured

in terms of the heat required to raise a measured mass of water through
a definite range of temperature.

   CIf the mass of water be 1 gramme, and the range of temperature 1 °

of the hydrogen thermometer from 9°-5 C. to ]0°-5 C. of the scale of that
thermometer, then, according to the best of the existing determinations,
the amount of heat required is 4-2 Joules.

     It will, therefore, be convenient to fix upon this number of Joules as a

secondary unit of heat.

    This secondary thermal unit may be called a * Calorie.'
       ----

154 REPORT-- 1896.

     For the present a second proposition is

  --Proposition II. The amount of heat required to raise the tempera-

ture of 1 gramme of water 1° C. of the scale of the hydrogen ther-
mometer, at a mean temperature which may be taken as 10° C. of that

thermometer, is 4'2 Joules.

     If further research should show that the statement in II. is not exact,
the definition could be adjusted by a small alteration in the mean tem-
perature at which the rise of 1° takes place. The definition in I. and
the number (4-2) of Joules in a Calorie would remain unaltered.

     In Appendix II. a table is given showing the capacity for heat of
water between 10° C. and 20° C, and in Appendix III. the values of the
total heat of water has been calculated by Mr. Shaw from his experiments
of Regnault and Rowland.

      Professor J. Y. Jones has, during the year, calculated the correction

to be applied to the value of the international ohm in absolute measure
given by him at the Oxford meeting (189i), in consequence of the ellipticity
of the standard coil used in his experiments. The required correction is
·00684 per cent., and the corrected value of the international ohm is

·99983 X 10'' absolute units.
     In conclusion the Committee recommend that they be reappointed,

with a grant of 5/. ; that Professor G. Carey Foster be chairman, and
Mr. R. T. Glazebrook secretary.

  EXTBACTS FROM LETTERS RECEIVED, DEALING WITH THE QUESTION OF
                                      THE Unit of Heat.

           1. From Dr. C. Dieterici, Professor of Physics, Hanover.

     [This reply has, since it was sent to Mr. Griffiths, been printed in full in
Wiedemann's A/maleH for February 1896. It is therefore not thought necessary

to print it again here.]

                 2.--From Dr. Dorn, Professor of Physics, Halle,

                                            December 27, 1895.

                                                      [Traxslatiox.]

     ... I quite agree with you that it is very necessary there should be
an improvement in the department of calorimetry, and that the first step
must be the determination of sharply defined units. I agree with you
in the opinion that the new unit ought not to difier in a marked degree
from the present, for it would otherwise cause great inconvenience to
both physicists and chemists, and there would be no hope of introducing
the new unit technically.

     I have really no objection to offer to the thermal unit being 42 x lO*""
ergs (or rather 41-89 x 10'' ergs).

          3. From Dr. W. Osticald, Professor of Chemistry, Leijjziff,

                                           February 12, 1890.

                                                    [Translation.]

     I entirely agree with your proposal to take some multiple of the erg

as unit of heat. Such a step seems to me so undoubtedly necessary that,
in my opinion, the question is lohen and not if such a change should be
---- --

carried out. I therefore regard your proposition as a welcome oppor-

tunity for going into the neglected question, and I may say that I am
determined to recalculate, in the forthcoming third edition of my text-

book, the whole of the thermo-chemical data in such a manner as to do

my utmost to diminish the difficulties consequent on the transition. I
have already (in 1891) expressed my opinion very clearly, and I now send

you the memoir referring to it.'

     I differ from your proposals, however, as regards the magnitude of

the unit to be adopted. I believe that only an erg multiplied by some
integral power of 10 should be chosen. I formerly proposed a Mega-erg,

but have now altered my opinion.
    As a practical multiple of the erg, we already possess one in electricity,

=viz., the Joule 10' ergs ; and it appears to me to have the great

advantage that the practical unit of energy in constant use in the
two great departments of electiical and thermal measurements would be
identical ; therefore I do not think that any other choice could be so

advantageous.

4. From Dr. F. FascJien, Tit. Professor of Physics, Hanover,

                                November 24, 1895.

We. . .  must have an absolute unit simply related to other absolute

units, and that would be your ' Rowland ' ; but we must also know how

to realise this unit. For this purpose the specific heat of water must be

fixed for each temperature.

     I think, as the different observations on the variability of the specific
heat of water differ so greatly, your statement III. (p. 3) is a very

preliminary one. ... I think it would be best to propose that a new

determination of the changes in the specific heat of water should be
undertaken by some institute that has the necessary apparatus and
money.

    If I may venture on giving my opinion on the propositions made by

you, I must emphasise, before all things, that I agree with you as to the
necessity of having a well-defined universal unit of heat, and I should be

very glad if your well-considered plans led to a definite result. As a
theorist I would make even more radical demands as to the unit to be
defined. The ideal universal unit of heat appears to me to be still more

closely related to the definition of the electrical units ; consequently I
would define :

I. One ' Rowland ' (or ' Meyer,' or ' Kelvin ') as that quantity of heat

which is equivalent to 1 0^ ergs.

II. According to the best measurements hitherto obtained 1 'Row-

land' is that quantity of heat which raises 1 gramme of water at 15° C.

through 2°-.39 C. It would be possible to modify this number in the

Welight of subsequent experiments.  should thus avoid the arbitrary

character involved in the choice of such numbers as 41-89 x lO*" or 42 x 10^.

At the same time I quite acknowledge that the establishment of this unit

will cause a considerable revolution in present thermal calculations which
will be difficult to carry out, and it will therefore probably meet with
energetic opposition from practical physicists and from technical men.
Still, as I have already remarked, I should consider it a great step in
advance if even the value of the equivalent cf heat were established.

                          6. From Dr. Wiillner, Professor of Pltysics, Aachen,

                                                    February 23, 1896.

                                               [Teanslation.]

     I, also, have finally decided on determining the unit of heat by the
work done, inasmuch as I have endeavoured to determine the work which

is equivalent to the mean calorie measured by the ice calorimeter.
    I hope I made it evident that I am quite aware of the uncertainty of

this method of calibration. I thus arrived at the value 4175-S X 10\ or, in
whole numbers, 4176 x 10^, whicli, according to Rowland, corresponds to the

heat required to raise the unit weight of water through 1° G. at 22° C.

of the air thermometer.

I am, however, quite willing, if an agreement can be arrived at, to

discard the always uncertain relation to the mean unit of heat, and to

accept your proposed unit 42 x 10''. The tejnperature 15°, at wliich the

specific heat of water is then unity, is more convenient. The consequence

of such an agreement will be that all thermal measurements in which

absolute values are aimed at will be made with the water calorimeter,

in which case it appears easier to experiment with temperatures about

15°                 also  we  are  in  better  agreement  as   to  the  behaviour  of  water
                 ;

between 10° C. and 20° C, although, even then, there is not complete

certainty. I should, for example, prefer to make the reductions at 15°

entirely according to the observations of Rowland, as he has directly

measured the equivalent of heat at these temperatures. Finally, as

regards the designation of the new unit, I do not approve of giving it the
name of a physicist ; also the name ' therm ' is suitable for English

physicists, but not for others.

    Why should we not simply preserve the name ' thermal unit ' ? Or, if

a distinctive name is used, then, approximating to the long-used ' calorie,'

Acall the new unit a ' calor.' The definition would then be, ' calor is the

heat value of 41-89 x 10'^ ergs,' and, until further notice, the calor will be

equal to the amount of heat which will raise the unit mass of water

at 15° through 1° C.

    No especial name has been given to the length of the mercury column

which is equivalent to 1 ohm. In no case would I advocate the adoption

of a second definition for the practical unit (besides ' Rowland,' ' calor,'

or simply ' thermal unit '), as that would lead to confusion.

    7. From Dr. Boltzmann, Professor of Theoretical Physics, Vienna,

                                         November 26, 1895.

     The unit ought to be as simple as possible and capable of accurate
determination, as all other qualities are of less importance. It would be
simplest to choose the heat which raises the temperature from 10° to 11° C.

    In general I am in accord with all you say in your paper. The most

important thing is that the same conception should be adopted everywhere,
and for this reason I will fully accept the decision of the majority of the
Committee.

         8. From Dr. K. Olszewski, Professor of Chemistry, Cracow,

                                            December 14, 1895.

    I have taken the advice of my colleagues in the Cracow University,

Professors Witkowski and Natanson, and I beg to submit to your attention,
as well as to that of the British Association Electrical Standards Com-

mittee, the following suggestions, being the conclusions arrived at con-
jointly by the above-named gentlemen and myself.

      1 It would be advisable, on theoretical grounds, to select a Joule, or
10^ ergs, as the fundamental theoretical or ideal unit of heat-energy.
Hence the following proposal is brought forward :

             ' That the theoretical or thermo-dijnamical, or, say, c.g.s. standard
        thermal unit, be defined as the heat equivalent of a Joule or of 10^
       ergs, and termed a thermal Joule.'

      2. That, as a "practical thermcd unit, the quantity of heat required to

raise 1 gramme of pure water through 1° of the thermo-dynamical scale at

15° of that scale be temporarily adopted.

3. That, in view of the exceptional importance of the question, steps be

taken, by international co-operation or otherwise, leading to the deter-

mination of the numerical value of the ratio between the theoretical unit

and the practical unit, defined by 15°, as above stated, by some at least of

the leading physical and metrological laboratories and institutions of the

world,  with the highest  degree of  accuracy  nowadays  attainable                                         and to
                                                                                                         ;

the extension (if possible) of such determinations over as great a range of

temperature as practicable. Added to the highly valuable work already

done, such an investigation cannot fail to settle the question of the specific

heat of water ; and if this be done, the subject of thermal units will have

lost nearly all of its present difficulty.

  9. From Dr. Cliappuis, Bureau International des Poids et Mesures,

                                      Sevres, February 2, 1896.

                                                     [Translation.]

    . . . Your arguments have led me to accept the propositions given by

you on pp. 452 and 453.

    If, however, I may be allowed to express a wish, it is that the values
may be reduced to the normal scale of temperature, i.e., to that of the

hydrogen thermometer, and not to the air or nitrogen.

     It is true that the diSerence between these scales is very small, but

still it is perfectly measurable. Some experiments of the Bureau Inter-
national des Poids et Mesures (not yet published) have led me to the

conclusion that the thermometric scale of hydrogen is independent of the
initial pressui-e between 0-5 and 2 atmospheres, and that the hydrogen
tiiermometer at constant pressure gives sensibly the same values as the
thermometer at constant volume. It is not so with the nitrogen or the
air thermometer.

     The difference between the nitrogen and hydrogen scales is indicated
both in the original memoir (' Trav. et M^m. du Bui-eau International,'

Also a great number of physicists have adopted the decision of the
International Committee of the Poids et Mesures to take, as the normal
scale of temperature, that of the hydrogen thermometer at constant

volume.

     ... I should like the thermal unit to be a number of ergs chosen
arbitrarily either 10* ergs, or, in order to approach more nearly to the

                                                                      ;

present unit, 5 x 10*^ ergs. Then, as practical unit, I should like two :

A(1) unit, of precision analogous to the ohm, which should be the quantity

of heat yielded by a given mass of mercury in passing from one state to
another, the states being defined by volume or electrical conductivity.
(2) The present unit should be the specific heat of water at 1-3°.

     The use of water is indispensable for current researches, but it appears

to me very doubtful for researches of precision.

      It is supposed that the condition of water and, consequently, its internal

energy are completely determined when the pressure and temperature are
ascertained. Now, nothing is less probable. Since Ramsay's researches,
we know decisively that water is formed of a mixture of molecules at
various degrees of association ; it is a system in equilibrium. The state of
equilibrium of analogous systems is in theory entirely defined when the
pressure and temperature are known. But in practice the state of
equilibrium is only attained with an extreme slowness, and sometimes it is
never reached. The lower the temperature, the more serious are those

delays in reaching the state of equilibrium. It is therefore possible that

the specific heat of water varies with the temperature, and that it differs
according to whether the initial temperature of the experiment, has been
reached when ascending or descending.

      I believe that if the French Committee adopt your proposal as to the
fixing of the new unit, they will declare themselves still more decidedly
in favour of the name which you have gi\en them, as it has already been
proposed here to name ' therm ' the equivalent of heat of the erg or of one

of its decimal multiples.

     I do not think, in return, that we could agree with you as to the scale
of the nitrogen thermometer. There appears to be no doubt that the
hydrogen thermometer gives a scale extremely like the thermo-dvnamic, and
that it is, at all events, the most analogous we can have. Sooner or later
it will be necessary to adopt the thermo-dynamic scale, and it is well
to now approach to it as nearly as possible.

     Besides, this scale is one of a certain small number of units on which a
legal authority has been conferred. It is now included in the decisions
arrived at by the International Committee of Weights and Measures,
which a certain number of States have introduced into their legislation.

     In itself the thing is actually of little importance ; but it becomes more
----

important in proportion as experiments become more exact, and it is best
to have as little as possible to change in the end.

                                           December 10, 1895.

     ... I must say your proposal appeals to me in every way. The
10° unit seems to me to be preferable to the 15° one.

13. From Professor H. L. Callendar, Professor of Physics, McGill

                     University, Montreal, December 5, 1895.

     I entirely agree that it would be a very great nnprovement to adopt
an absolute unit in place of the present various and uncertain units based
upon the peculiar properties of water. I think, however, that it would be
better to connect it more simply and directly with the system of electrical
units, and to use only names which are already familiar to all engineers,
than to attempt to retain a close approximation to the value of any of the
old specific heat units, which are essentially arbitrary.

     The following are the names of the series of thermal units which I

should be inclined to suggest as being already famiUar in practice :

1. The thermal watt-second, or 'Joule,' defined as being equivalent
Ato 10" c.g.s. units of work.
                               rider might be added to the effect that,

according to the best determinations, this unit is approximately equal to

\ of the gramme degree centigrade at 10° C.

     2. The thermal watt-hour, which would be equivalent to 3,600
Joules, and would therefore be of a similar magnitude to the kilogramme
degree centigrade, which is so largely used in the thermo-dynamics of the
steam-engine. The watt-hour, in fact, would be exactly -2ths of the kilo-
gramme degree centigrade at some temperature in the neighbourhood of

10° C.

     3. The thermal kilowatt-hour, or simply kilowatt-hour, which, as
the Board of Trade unit of electrical energy, is already so familiar and
u.seful for the commercial measurement of large quantities of energy.

    In connection with the latter unit it may be remarked that it would

be a great advantage if engineers could be induced to adopt the kilowatt
as their unit of mechanical power in place of the horse power. The latter
unit differs from the 'cheval-vapeur,' and being based upon the foot-pound
has different values in different latitudes. For the order of accuracy
generally attainable in steam-engine work, it would, as a rule, be suflicient
to take the horse power as being |ths of the kilowatt power.

     For steam-engine work undoubtedly one of the most important units
at present in use is the British thermal unit, or pound degree Fahrenheit.
It happens that the watt-hour is very nearly equal to 3-400 B.T.U.

The reduction of the latter to watt-hours may be very readily effected by

multiplying by 0-3 and then reducing the result by 2 per cent.
     It would seem, on the whole, not improbable that the simple adoption

of all the familiar units of electrical energy, with the prefix ' thermal,' if
necessary, as our absolute units of heat, would result in a more general
agreement and a greater simplification of expression than any attempt to

re-define one of the older units in terms of the absolute system. The
                                           --

 160 REPORT-- 1896.

 latter course might readily lead to confusion, and would necessitate the
 retention of the constant factor J:=4"2 x 10^ in our equations whenever
 they involved electrical or mechanical measurements.

      To put the question in a brief and concrete form for the consideration
 of the Committee, I think that the views above expressed might be
 embodied in some such resolutions as the followine' :

       1. That the thermal equivalents of the practical units of electrical

 energy above mentioned may be taken as convenient absolute units of

 heat.

      2. That when used to denote quantities of heat these units may be

 distinguished, if necessary, by prefixing the word ' thermal.'
       3. That the ' thermal watt-second,' which is intended to represent

 10" c.g.s. units of energy, be also called a 'Joule.'
      4. That tlie heat developed by an electromotive force equal to that of

 a standard Clark cell at 15° C, when acting through a resistance equal to
one standard ohm, may be taken as 1-4340 Joule per second.

      5. That (pending the results of further investigations) the quantity of

 heat required to raise the temperature of one gramme of water through

 one degree of the centigrade air thermometer in the neighbourhood of

 10° C. may be taken as 4'200 Joules.
     6. That the thermal watt-hour, which is equal to 3-600 Joules, may

be taken as equal to -Oths of the kilogramme degree centigrade at 10° C, or
 as equal to 3-4 times the pound degree Fahrenheit at 50° F.

      7. That for the reduction of observations to the standard temperature
 of 10° C. or 50° F., the temperature coefficient of the diminution of the

specific heat of water may be taken as -00036 per 1° C, or -00020 per

 1° F., over the range 10° to 20°.

     With regard to the last resolution I do not see that anything would be
gained in the present state of our knowledge by adopting a more compli-
cated or discontinuous formula of reduction, until we are prepared to

extend it to higher ranges of temperature.

     The name 'Joule,' as that of the father of the mechanical measurement
of heat, would not, I think, be Open to objection. At the same time I feel
that the choice of a special name for the absolute unit of lieat is one com-
paratively of secondary importance. The really essential points to impress
upon the world of science in general, and upon engineers in particular,
are, that the specific heat of water is far from constant, and that 772

foot-pounds are not very accurately equivalent to the B.T.XJ. Also that
in measuring quantities of heat by the rise in temperature of a mass of
water it is most important to have an accurately verified thermometer,
and to state the limits of temperature between which the observations
were taken. It would certainly be a great advantage for the reduction
and comparison of observations to use always the same standard formulae,
such as those which you suggest ; but it would still be necessary in accurate
work to state the limits of temperature for subsequent identification, should
these formulaa prove on more exact investigation to be not sufficiently
approximate.

                       University, Ithaca, U.S.A., January 12, 1896.

       The suggestion of defining the heat units by means of the melting of ice

 strikes me so favourably that, in spite of the difficulties which have hitherto
 been found in determining the precise heat of fusion, I am considering the
 question of the redetermination by new methods with a view of finding

 whether one can obtain a sufficient degree of accuracy to warrant the
 adoption of the heat of fusion of water as the basis for thermal measure-
 ment.

     15. From Professor Eoidand, Professor of Physics, Johns Iloplcins

                     University, Baltimore, U.S.A., December 15, 1895.

     As to the standard for heat measurement, it is to be considered from

 both a theoretical as well as a practical standpoint.
      The ideal theoretical unit would be that quantity of heat necessary to

 melt one gramme of ice. This is independent of any system of ther-
 mometry, and presents to our minds the idea of quantity of heat indepen-

 dent of temperature.
      Thus the system of thermometry would have no connection whatever

 with the heat unit, and the first law of thermodynamics would stand, as it
 should, entirely independent of the second.

      The idea of a quantity of heat at a high temperature being very dif-
ferent from the same quantity at a low tempei'ature would then be easy
and simple. Likewise we could treat thermodynamics without any refer
ence to temperature until we came to the second law, which would then
introduce temperature and the way of measuring it.

     From a practical standpoint, however, the unit depending on the

 specific heat of water is at present certainly the most convenient. It has

been the one mostly used, and its value is well known in terms of energy,

furthermore, the establishment of institutions where it is said thcSrmo-
meters can be compared with a standard renders the unit very available
in practice. In other words, this unit is a better practical one at j^re-

sent. I am Aery sorry this is so, because it is a very poor theoretical one

indeed.

     But as we can write our text-books as we please, I suppose that it is

best to accept the most practical unit. This I conceive to be the heat

required to raise a gramme of water 1° C. on the hydrogen thermometer

at 20° C.

     I take 20° because in ordinary thermometry the room is usually about
this temperature, and no reduction will be necessary. Howe%er, 15°
would not be inconvenient, or 10° to 20°.

    As I write these words I have a feeling that I may be wrong. Why

should we continue to teach in our text-books that heat has anything to

do with temperature? It is decidedly wrong, and if I ever write a text-
book I shall probably use the ice unit. But if I ever write a scientific
paper of an experimental nature I shall probably use the other unit.

 necessary to express tlie author's data in absolute measure, except tliat

--for the mere purposes of comparison one datum the dynamical equivalent

 at one specitied temperature-- is not actually required. At the same time
 the comparison of data is in no way vitiated by tlie use of some number

 (for the present a conventional one), in order to convert a result from
 some definite gramme- degree-unit to Joules.

     An examination of the tables of thermal data with a view to expressing

 the results in Joules furnishes, therefore, a very effective test of the com-

 parability of the results obtained by different observers for the same
 thermal constants, and, moreover, the difficulties to be met with in making

the reduction to Joules give the best indication of the points which must
be settled before the results of thermal measurement can be regarded as
final. To carry out such an examination completely, using numbers for
reduction that can only be regarded as provisional, would be an unneces-

sary labour, but a few selected instances may help to exhibit some of the

uncertainties which might reasonably be expected to disappear if ob-
servers once recognised the desirability of expressing all thermal mea-
surements in Joules, or in some accepted equivalent.

     As an example, I have computed the total heat of water at various
temperatures as determined experimentally. I have used Rowland's num-

bers for lower temperatures, and have recomputed Regnault's experiments,

accepting Table I. (computed from Rowland) as correct.

     I think it might be possible to find data enough to recompute some

others, e.g., the latent heat of steam at 100°, the specific heat of air at

constant pressure, which, by the way, is almost exactly a Joule. The
labour is, howe^'er, very considerable, and it might be abbreviated (for the
Committee) if those who are or have recently been engaged in thermal
measurements would supply the Committee with the results of their own
observations reduced to Joules and thermometric units.

as given in Rowland's table for the mean calorimeti'ic temj^erature of the
experiment, and adding to the heat thus computed as that given out by-
one gramme of water in cooling from T° to the final calorimetric tempera-
ture, the further amount which, upon an estimation based on Rowland's
data, would be given out on cooling to 0°.

     Some doubt has been thrown on the accuracy of the data quoted by
Regnault in the table referred to. I have adopted Mr. Macfarlane Gray's
conclusion that the computations of the mean specific heat are correct,
though the data are erroneously printed in Regnault's paper.

     The results of the individual experiments are shown in the following
table. In order to obtain a mean result a curve of differences (see figure)

--Meteorological Observations on Ben Nevis. Eeport of the Committee,

    consistinfj of Lord McLarex, Professor A. Crum Brown (Secretary),

     Dr. JoHX Murray, Dr. Alexander Buchan, and Professor R.

     Co^ELA^'D. {Brawn up hij Dr. Buchax.)

The Committee were appointed, as in former years, for the purpose of co-

operating with the Scottish Meteorological Society in making meteorological

obsei'vations on Ben Nevis.

     The hourly eye observations, carried on by night as well as by day,
have been made without interruption during the year at the top of Ben

Nevis                                      and the continuous registrations and other observations have been
                                        ;

carried on at the Low Level Observatory at Fort William with the same

fulness of detail as heretofore.

     The Directors of the Observatories tender their best thanks to Messrs.

A. Drysdale, M.A., B.Sc, A. Russell, B Sc, G. Ednie, and W. Thomson

for the assistance they I'endered as volunteer obsei'vers during the summer

months, thus giving a greater extension than could otherwise have been

given to the holiday time of the members of the regular observing staff,

which it is in every way so desirable to secure.

Table I. gives for 1895 the monthly mean pressure, mean and ex-

treme                                      temperatures                                                                            hours of    sunshine ;  amount of  rainfall ; number

of fair days, and of days when the rainfall exceeded one inch ; the mean

percentage of cloud ; and the mean rain-band at both Observatories ; and

the mean hourly velocity of the wind in miles at the top of the mountain.

The mean barometric pressures at the Low Level Observatory are reduced

to 32'^ and sea lc\el, but those at top of the Ben are reduced to 32° only.

-- --season prevailed in other words, it was decidedly cyclonic and conse-

quently at both Observatories the lowering of the temperature below the
average was substantially the same. But in February it was quite other-

wise, the weather of this month being eminently anticyclonic. Hence,
on account of the higher temperature at the top accompanying the anti-
cyclones, the mean temperature of the month was only ·i'^w under the
average, but at Fort William the mean temperature was 7°'6 under the

average. This effect of the prevailing anticyclones is also well seen in

the difference of the mean temperature at the two Observatories. From
the past observations the mean difference in February is 1.5°-1, whereas

in February 1895 the difference was only 12°'2.
     Similarly striking contrasts were shown in the weather of the summer

months at the two Observatories. The following indicates the departures,
from the mean temperatures from June to September :

METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON BEN NEVIS.  1G9

     The lUiiximum temperature at Fort William was 7r)°'0 on June 2, and
at the top 59''-9 on September 9 ; where on June 25, r)'J°-8 was recorded.
The minimum temperature was, at Fort William S^-i) on February 11,
and on January 28 9°*0 was recorded ; and at the top 1°'8 on February 7.
This is the lowest minimum temperature yet recorded at the Fort AVillians
Observatory ; and the above minimum, l°-8, at the top of the mountain, is
the lowest there, with the exception of the jirevious year, when tempera-
ture fell to 0°'7. The minimum on the top fell ))elow freezing each
month.

    As regards extremes of temperature, the diflerence between the
maxima was greater in July, when it was 21°-0, and least in February,
when it was only 9° '5 ; and the difference between the minima greatest
in April, when it was 18°-3, and least in January, when it was only 3°'0.

     The registrations of the sunshine recorder at the top sliow 695 houi'S
out of a possible 4,470 hours, being 115 hours fewer than in 1894. This

equals 16 per cent, of the possible sunshine. The maximum was 149 hours
in June, and the minimum 3 hours in December, being, along with January

of the previous year, the lowest hitherto recorded in any month, except

in December 1893, when there was only 1 hour of sunshine. At Fort
William the number for the year was 1,132 hours, or 28 hours fewer
than in 1894. The largest number was 208 hours in June, and the least
8 hours in December. As the number of hours of possible sunshine at

Fort AVilliam Observatory is 3,497 hours, the sunshine of 1895 was
32 per cent, of the possible number of hours.

     In Table V. are enumerated for each month the lowest hygrometric

observations :

William the annual mean was 3-6, the highest being 5-3 in July, and the

lowest 1-7 in February.

     The mean hourly velocity of the wind at the top of the Ben was 10

miles for the year, the highest monthly mean for the year being 23 miles

for December, and the lowest 5 miles for June. This minimum of 5

aniles per hour is the lowest mean monthly velocity yet recorded for any

anonth since the beginning of 1884. For the three summer months, June,

July, and August, the mean was at the rate of 11 miles per hour ; but in
December, January, and February it was 21 miles, or nearly double the

.summer velocity.

     The rainfall for the year at the top of the mountain was 118*00 inches,

Ijeing 31-87 inches less than in 1894; and the lowest that has yet

·occurred, excepting the year 188G, when tiie amount was 107"8.'5 inches.
The highest monthly amount was 15-41 inches in December, and the

lowest 3-54 inches in February. The above monthly maximum of 15-41

inches is a very low maximum for the top of Ben Nevis. The heaviest

daily fall was 3-48 inches on August 29, which is also a rather small

maximum daily fall for the year.
     On the top rain fell on 250 days, and at Fort William on 211 days,

t»eing respectively 10 and 27 days under their averages. The maximum

number of days on which rain fell at the top was 28 days in July and the

:same number in August ; and at Fort AVilliam, 27 days in August ; and
the minimum number of days 9 at the top, and 8 at Fort William in

February.

     During the year the number of days on which an inch of rain was

exceeded was 36 at the top and 8 at Fort William.

     The mean rain-band (0-8) was 2-3 at the top and 3-6 at Fort William,

Ibeing nearly the average                                                                                              the lowest being in January and February, and

November 10.

     At Fort William the mean atmospheric pressure was for the year

reduced to 32° and sea-level 29-852 inches, and at the top reduced only to

32^, 25-284 inches, being 0-005 inch above, and 001 2 inch under, the

respective averages. The difference for the two heights was thus 4-568

inches, the mean difference being 4*553 inches. At the top the highest

pressure was 25-975 inches on May 3, and the lowest 23-889 inches on

November 11, the annual range being thus 2-086 inches; and at Fort

William the highest was 30-673 inches on February 16, and the lowest

28-601 inches on November 10, the annual range beijig 2-072 inches.

     The differences from the monthly means of the two Observatories

greatly exceeded the average differences in January, February, October,
             METEOROLO(;iCAL OBSEKVATIOXS OX IJKN NEVIS.  171

and December, which were substantially occasioned by the very low tem-
perature of these months, so that the higli-level pressure, when reduced

to sea level, closely agrees with the sea le\el pressure at Fort William.

     In September, ho\ve\er, though the mean temperature was 3° '5 and
5° -4 respectively above the averages, the difference between the mean

pressure at the two Observatories was 4-487 inches, the September averages

of the previous 15 years being 4-450 inches. The characteristic of the
weather of the month was eminently anticyclonic, and as the anticyclones

extended, in a modified form, downward, considerably below the level of

the summit, they carried down with them their characteristically very dry
and therefore heavier air, thus increasing the density of the aerial stratum
between the top and bottom of the mountain, above what would have
been if this stratum had been of tlie usual humidity. Hence pressure at
Fort William was relatively higher, and consequently the difference
between pressure at the top and bottom was correspondingly increased.

     But during the last three days of the month over Scotland the sky

was clear, sunshine strong, humidity high, night temperatures unusually
high, and dews heavy, with calms or light winds. The weather of this period

has been discussed with some fulness in a paper published in the last
issued 'Journal of the Scottish Meteorological Society,' to which reference

may be here made. On these days, while at the top temperature was

very high and the air clear and very dry, at Fort William, under a sky
equally clear and temperature high, the air showed a large humidity, and

this state of moisture extended to a height of about 2,000 feet, or nearly
halfway to the summit. Thus, then, while the barometer at the top was
under an atmosphere wholly anticyclonic, with its accompanying dry

dense air, the barometer at Fort AVilliam was not so circumstanced. Ou

the other hand, it was under the jjressure of such dry dense air, above
the height of 2,000 feet only, Avhereas from this height down to sea level
it was under the pressure of air whose humidity was large and pressure
therefore much reduced. The result was that the sea-level pressure at

Fort William was 0-050 inch lower than it would have been if the dry

dense air of the anticyclone had been continued down to Fort William.

This is confirmatory of what is to be expected, that the greater density
of dry air as shown in our laboratories prevails equally in the fi-ee

atmosphere.

     The discussion of the observations reveals numerous instances of an
opposite condition of things, viz., the air at the lower levels remaining

comparatively dry, while aloft at higher altitudes it is becoming rapidly

moister, the moister air gradually occupying lower levels as a cyclone is

--advancing. In these cases the lower barometer reads not the relatively

Anlower, but the relatively higher, of the two.  important result is

emerging as the discussion proceeds, since it appears that an indication

is hereby given towards a more accurate knowledge than is at present

possessed of the intensity of a coming cyclone and of the attendant anti-

cyclone.

In addition to the variability of the distribution with height of the

immidity, the distribution of the temperature is also being particularly

investigated, especially as regards the light it casts on the interpretation

of the causes leading to the variability in the vertical distribution of the

pressure. This department of the inquiry is in the hands of Mr. Omond,
who read a preliminary paper on the subject at the meeting of the

Scottish Meteorological Society in July last.
172 KEroRT-- 1896.

The large inquiry carried on Ijy Dr. Buchan and Mr. Omond for some

years, and reported on to the British Association in preceding Reports, on

the influence of fog or cloud and clear weatlier respectively on the diurnal

fluctuations of the barometer has been extended into other regions of the

globe, notably into the Arctic regions, particularly over the ocean, the

data employed being the observations made liy Mohn, during 1876-78,

over the Norwegian .Sea and the Arctic Ocean, and those by the expedition

of the Austrians in Jan Mayen, and ocean in the neighbourhood, in

1882-83. The inquiry will be completed in a few months, and the results

Avill be communicated to the next meeting of the British Association.

For the contribution of the observations necessaiy to the carrying out

of these inquiries the directors of tlie Ben Nevis Observatories have

resolved to establish a temj^orai-y station, intermediate in height between

the two Observatories, for the purpose of ascertaining with greater pre-

cision than has hitherto been possible the extent to which anticyclones

descend on the mountain, and more particularly the relations of pressure,

temperature, and humidity at the new station as compared with the

Aobservations at Fort William and the summit of Ben Nevis.  suitable

situation was formally obtained from tlie tenant on August 1-1, a complete

set of instruments procured, and the building materials conveyed for the

enlargement of the present hut to accommodate Mr. Muir, one of the

assistant masters of the High School of Edinburgh, who had vokinteerecl

his services as observer till the close of September. The height of the

hut, where the barometer is placed, is 2,196 feet, or nearly midway in

height between the two Observatories and the thermometer, rain-gauge,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

and other instruments are placed 30 yards distant above the hut over a grass

plot on a slight ridge, which will to a large extent secure that the down-

flowing cold-air currents which set in from terrestrial radiation chiefly at

night will pass down on each side, thus protecting the thermometers from

their disturbing influence.

--The Applicafion of Plwtor/raphy to the Flucidation of Meteorolo(jiccd
     Phenomena. Sixth Report of the Committee, consistiiuj of Mr,
     G. J. Sy.mons (Chuirman), Professor R. Meldola, Mr. J.
    HoPKixsox, and Mr. A. W. Clavden (Secretary). (Drawn ujj by

       the Secretary?)

During the past year the attention of your Committee has been almost

entirely confined to the determination of cloud altitudes by the photo-

graphic method briefly sketched in former reports. As this method

difiers considerably from those which have been employed elsewhere, and
as it has been found to give very satisfactory results, it seems desirable to
give a fuller description of the apparatus than appears in the report of
two years back, in which it was flrst indicated.

     The observations are carried on upon a level piece of ground close to
Exeter, between some workshops and shunting lines belonging to the
London and South-Western Railway Company, who have given your
Committee an agreement providing for the use of the site on payment of
a nominal rent of \l. per annum. This ground is conveniently near the
residence of the Secretary to your Committee : it provides an excellent
sky view without interference of trees or buildings, and, being the property
of the railway company, is under a certain amount of supervision.
          ox THE ELUCIDATION OF METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA. 173

     The site, moreover, admits of the selection of a base-line lying exactly
east and west, a point of some impoi'tance for simplifying the reduction of

the observations.

     The observing stations are at present placed only 200 yards apart.
They are connected l)y a line of wire stretched on small telegraph poles in

the ordinary manner. At each end the iron wire is soldered to an india-
rubber coated insulated copper wire, which is led down one of the stays of
the last pole into the camera-stand, in such a manner as to prevent any
rain-water from flowing down this wire into the apparatus contained in

the stand.

     Each stand is a four-sided cupboard built of thick matchboard ing,
three sides sloping towards the top, which forms a level table about
18 inches square. The fourth side, which faces north, contains a door
which can be locked. The base of the cupboard is about 2 feet 6 inches
square, and is supported by four legs about 9 inches above the surface of
the ground. Several coats of paint have made these stands so secure
against weather that exposure for more than two years has not eflected
any injury except a slight shrinkage in the top, which is easily repaired.

As the cameras and electrical apparatus are contained in these boxes, their

construction is important.

      The two observing cameras have been specially constructed. Each
sv/ings on trunnions between uprights rigidly secured to a flat stand. The
camera can thus be directed to any altitude, and can be tirmly clamped.
 In order to make this clamping secure, and at the same time add to the

 steadiness of the whole, there is fixed to the base board of the swinging
 camera a flat board whose margin foi'ms a segment of a circle whose centre
 is the same as that of the trunnions. This passes smoothly between two

 pieces of wood let into the flat stand, which can be drawn together by a
 screw, thereby grasping the margin of the circle. The surfaces of contact
 are faced with leather, in order to prevent any sticking or injury to the

 polished clamping-board.

      Adjustment in azimuth, which need not be done with any great exact-
 ness, is eflected by rotating the whole apparatus on the levelled top of the

 camera-box. Each camera is provided with a lens of 18 inches focal
 lengtli, which is provided with an iris diaphragm, and covers a plate of

 the size known as whole plate.
      The two lenses were carefully compared, both by testing their focal

 lengths by the ordinary methods, and Anally by comparing two views

 taken simultaneously with the two cameras placed side by side. When it

 was seen that the two pictures coincided exactly, it was certain that the
 adjustments were correct, and the focus of each camera was fixed by

 firmly screwing up the adjusting screws and putting a coat of varnish

 over them to prevent any possibility of after-slipping. This fine adjust-
 ment is rendered possible by making the back part of the camera of the
  well-known ' bellows ' pattern. In order to be sure that no shrinkage of
 the materials should aflect the result, they were made of old, well-seasoned
 wood, were adjusted and freely exposed to sun and wind, and to the
 changes of temperature and moisture experienced by keeping them for

 several months in the camera-boxes. On again testing them by the

  superposition of two negatives, no change could be detected. The lenses
  are provided with shutters, which can be simultaneously released by an
 electro-magnet fixed to the front of the camera. The shutters used at

  present are of the kind known as the 'chronolux,' which can be adjusted
17i REPORT-- 1896.

for any exposure from three seconds down to the one-sixtieth ; but in
practice it is found that the exposures required are always very brief, and
a latitude of exposure from a quarter of a second downwards would be
ample. This is -vnth the diaphragm aperture about a quarter of an inch

in diameter, and it is evident that variation in this would afibrd the

equivalent of much greater variation in exposure. The shutters also
suffer from the fact that the sliding portions are made of ebonite, which is

liable to warp in consequence of the high temperatures sometimes pro-
duced in the interior of the camera-box when exposed to a hot summer
sun. Shutters like those at Kew, or with aluminium sliding parts, would

probably be better.

The electrical exposing connections proved to be a great source of

trouble. The site is on hard Permian .sandstones and breccias, which are
very dry, and so hard that it would have been very costly to have made a

laro'e hole to be filled with coke. After several trials a satisfactory earth

was ol)tained by leading the terminal to the end of about 50 yards of
copper wire, such as is used by bell-hangers, and twisting this to and fro
in a trench in the surface of the rock, which was then filled in with soil and

turfed over.

     The electro-magnets on the cameras, however, required a fairly strong
current to make sure that they would act, so the primary current from
the discharging key works two relays of similar construction, placed one
in each camera-box, which simultaneously close local independent cii'cuits

and release the shutters.
     Another source of trouble has been the batteries. Those used were

of the dry-cell type. But during the past summer they were found to

fail several times, the moisture essential to their working being apparently
driven off" by the excessive heat and drought to which they were exposed.
If they could l)e placed in a more substantial structure, which could be

kept cooler, they would doubtless do better. Your Committee propose to

replace them by Leclanche cells next year.
     The plates used have been those already found to give excellent

results for ordinary cloud photography, namely, Mawson and Swan's photo-

mechanical plates, or those prepared by the same firm for transparencies.
     They are carried in double dark slides of the ordinary pattern, two of

which are provided for each camera ; but those belonging to the camera at
one end of the base are slightly thicker, and differ in other ways from
those used at the other end, so that there is no possibility of mistaking
them after exposure, and they cannot Ije used for the wrong camera.

    On the right-hand side of the central \y.xvt of each camera is a small

view-finder, in which a minute image of the view is projected on ground
glass, and which is adjusted once for all, so that the view in the finder

corresponds with that on the plate.

   A loose piece of black velvet for each camera completes the apparatus.

    Two observers are required, one for eacli camera, and in making the

observations the Seci'etary to your Committee has been assisted by Mrs.

Clayden, or by his brother, Mr. C. E. Clayden.

Each observer is provided with three small flags-- pink, blue, and

yellow (to avoid railway colours), by means of which a simple code of
Asif^nals can be made. For simplicity, let us call tlie observers and B,

Aand suppose directs the observations and B can close the key which
Awill eft'ect the exposure.

dark slide in position, sets tho. shutter and adjusts the camera, so that the
image of the sun is in about the centre of the ground glass of the finder.
I> does the same with t!<e other camera, and, when i-eady, puts up the

Ayellow flag at that end, and stands ready to press the exposing key.

then watches for tlie best moment for exposure, and, when it arrives, holds

up the blue flag, on seeing which B presses the key and holds up the other

blue flag as a signal that the exposure is complete at that end of the line.
The pink flag is used as an indication that something is wrong, and delay

is inevitable ; but if pink and blue are shown simultaneously, it means
that the opportunity for a good observation has passed, and that the dark
slide must be closed while waiting for another chance.

    As soon as one exposure has been made the dark slide is turned, and
preparations are made for a second exposure, leaving tlie di-awing out of

Athe slide until the signal is given. When gives the signal for exposure

he has his watch in his hand, and notes the time at which he hears the
click made by the release of the shutter. This time is noted down and
checked as soon as possible afterwards by comparing the watch with a

trustworthy clock, and, if necessary, correcting the record.

     The exposures having been made, the cameras are replaced in their
boxes, the relays are examined to see that the armatures have broken the
local circuit, and the line wire is disconnected from the key, these precau-

tions being taken to make sure that tlie batteries may not run dowrk

owing to the circuits being unbroken or remade by the operations of
spiders or accumulations of earwigs, which find a welcome shelter in the
camera-boxes, and which it seems impossible to entirely exclude.

     The plates are then taken into the dark room, and before opening the
dark slides the shutter of each is pulled out a little way, while the date
and time of exposure are written in pencil in the corner of each plate. The
subsequent processes do not remove this. They are then developed with
pyro and ammonia developer, and for the most useful results a fairly rapid
development is best. It should be remembered that prints will not be
required, and that, provided all the detail obtainable is on the plate, very
great differences of density are permissible. Indeed, when the image of
the sun is quite hidden in a black blur, as seen by transmitted light, ifc
can always be found on the glass side of the negative as a white or pale
disc. Sometimes it is reversed, and stands out clearly by transmitted
light ; but this is exceptional with the exposures which have been used.

     In order to work out the negatives we have certain facts known.

These are the latitude and loiigitude of the place of observation, the
date and time at which the observation was made, and the relative
positions of the image of the sun, and the selected point of the cloud in the
 two negatives. The first step is to determine the altitude and azimuth of the
sun, since its image on the plate is the fixed point of reference from which
 the co-ordinates of the point of cloud in the image will be measured.

     From the declination of the sun corrected for variation, and from the
known latitude, the meridian zenith distance can be calculated. From

the Greenwich time observed, tlie longitude and the equation of time, the
sun's distance from the meridian is obtained.

      It .should be remembered that the meridian zenith distance need only
be determined once for a number of observations made within a few
hours of each other, and the correction of time is practically constant for
 a day. Moreover, it is useless to attempt to do more than ascertain the
altitude to the nearest minute of ai'c.

     Two lines are then drawn on the negative, one vertical and one hori-
zontal, intersecting in the centre of the sun's image. Two corresponding

points in the cloud are selected, and their respective linear distances from
the vertical and horizontal lines measured as accurately as possible. In
some hazy cases this cannot be done with greater accuracy than about
the -^yth of an inch ; but these are exceptions, and as a rule .some small

speck or sharp angle of cloud can be found, the position of which may be
fixed with certainty to the youth part of an inch. From these linear dis-

tances the angular displacement is easily found, either by direct calcula-

tion of the tangents or by reference to a previously constructed scale. By
addinf or subtracting from the sun's azimuth, as the case may Ije, the

position of the cloud point in azimuth from the two stations is determined,
and thence the horizontal distance of the point vertically beneath the
cloud from either station.

     Similarly the altitude of the cloud point from the same station is ob-
tained from the corresponding plate, and the height above the horizontal
plane then computed.

   ANow if a and b be the angles irnm the stations and B respectively,

the difference of their sum from 180° gives the angle subtended by the
base line at X, the point vertically beneath the cloud. "Then the distance

AX is given by the equation :
                Log AX=L sin 6 - L sin AXB + log AB
ON THE ELUCIDATION OF METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA. 177

Xand the height A of the cloud point above is given by the equation :

                 AX --Log /t=log
                                    + L tan alt. 10.

Thus in the case given above the angles a and b are 85° 45' and 92° 53',

AXBwhence  must be 1° 22'. The altitude in angular measui'e is 67° 16'.

Then :                  L sin 6     = 9-99945

                        LsinAXB= 837749

AXBIf the angle  becomes much smaller than 1° less confidence can be

placed in the result, and it is better to calculate from the different alti-
tudes at the two stations, as such minute angles can only occur when the

direction is nearly in line with the base.

AXBNow it is seen that in the above calculation the angle  is certainly

small, but owing to the length of focus adopted an angle of 2' may be

certainly detected, and by taking the mean of three or four measurements

there is little risk of error-. The height determined above was that of

some high cirriform clouds, and is confirmed, not only by other measure-

ments on the same plates, but by other determinations made 35 and 47

minutes later, the three determinations being 11-64, 11-2, and 11-45

miles.

   A little later in the same day a still higher layer of ciri'us appeared,

and two measurements of this at a brief interval of time work out to

16-83 and 17-02 miles.

     These are, of course, extreme altitudes, and are quoted in order to
show that the results obtained by the method employed are sufficiently

accurate even under such circumstances. With lower clouds the displace-
ments of the image relatively to that of the sun are much larger, and the

heights obtained are more uniform.

It should be remembered that the base line adopted is only 200 yards

long. This is not quite enough for very exact measurements of great

heights, nor is it enough for the determination of heights of less magni
tude when the clouds under observation ai'e either east or west, that is,

in line with the base. But, on the other hand, the effects of perspective

are quite sufficiently troublesome with low-level clouds, or when an upper
layer is seen through gaps in a lower one, and many negatives have had to
be rejected from the impossibility of identifying corresponding points. In
some cases the corresponding negatives were so much unlike that it was

difficult to believe they could really have been simultaneous exposures.
The distance of 200 yards has therefore been chosen as a convenient
mean. For low stratus and cumulus 100 yards would be better, and for
high cirrus about 400 yards would give more precise results.

     The orientation of the base line again simplifies the angular measure-

ments, but for observations in the afternoon later than about 3.30 to 4 p.m.

the horizontal projection of the base is reduced to a very trifling amount,

and a complete installation should certainly consist of three stations, the

third being placed either due north or due south of one of the others, so

that either an east and west oi' a north and south line could be used at

pleasure.

     The result of the observations made so far is to suiraest that the method

has certain advantages over others which have been used elsewhere.

     1. The long focus gives a large image on which much minute detail
can be seen, and affords a large displacement for a small angle and the

best opportunity of selecting accurately corresponding points on the
two negatives.

     2. The image of the sun as a fixed point of reference is completely

reliable.

     3. The observation of the time is easily made, can be made with
exactness, and is the only precise observation required at the time of

exposure.

     4. There is no possibility of misunderstanding between the two

obsei'vers.

     5. The share of work falling upon the assistant observer is extremely

simple.

     6. The shortness of base diminishes perspective difficulties and allows

the use of a smaller site.
     It has, however, one great disadvantage, it cannot be applied to clouds

which do not come near enough to the sun to be in the same field of view,
nor to clouds which completely hide' the sun. This, however, could easily
be got over by providing each camera with altitude and azimuth circles,
of which the former need only be graduated from the zenith to the horizon,
wliile the latter should be complete. They should be provided with
verniers reading to 2' of arc. Telephonic communication between the
two stations would also be a convenience, but its absence has only been
felt occasionally when things have gone wrong.

     Neaiiy a hundred pairs of exposures have been made, not counting

many experimental observations, but all these have not yet been worked out.
     The following table gives the heights so far determined. They are

given in yards and miles, the latter being offered for comparison with the

Kew results.

of determinations which have been made. Furthei- comment would be
prematui-e, but they show that there is a wide field for future investiga-
tion opened up in following the changes of level which attend changes in
form. The general tendency to rise shown by clouds forming is well
marked, and this is also true of the ascent of the general cloud-levels
towards the early afternoon. But many more observations are requirod
before such questions can be discussed. The negatives also contain matei-il
for some determinations of cloud velocity in a horizontal plane, but time has
not allowed of any being made as yet.

     Your Committee think, therefore, that the observations should certainly
be continued, as they promise to throw considerable light on many ques-
tions, and will at least give material for instructive comparison with
other determinations made in America and on the Continent.

     Your Committee have done little to add to their collection, the time
at their disposal having been almost entirely taken up by the cloud

measurements

ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIOX.                                    181

'The Committee for investigating the Earthquake and Volcanic Phenomena

of Japan,' and 'The Committee on Earth Tremors,' should not be re-

appointed individually, but that the whole subject should be referred to a

new committee (consisting largely of the members of the old committees),

which should be called 'The Committee on Seismological Observations.'

This Committee now presents its first report, and in doing so desires to

record its thanks to the Secretaries of the two old connnittees for having
continued their work as joint Secretaries to the new one. Statements

of what they have been doing form the bulk of the present report.

     The Committee, however, thinks that it would be well, in this its
first report, to state definitely what it hopes to accomplish, and how far it

thinks that the British Association should go. It has long been an un-

written rule, that the Association should initiate work, but should not

charge itself with its maintenance. That is precisely what your Committee

desires. Now that it has been proved that any important earthquake is

felt all over the globe, the Committee considers that ai-rangements should
he made for the record and study of these movements. Your Committee

believes that such records may prove as important as those of, e.g.,

terrestrial magnetism, and, just as v/e have magnetic observatories in

various parts of the world, so in its opinion should there be seismological

ones. But, before advocating their erection, it is essential that a decision

be arrived at as to the form and the degree of sensitiveness of instrument

to be recommended.

This, and correspondence connected with the organisation of the

system, is the work which the Committee desires to complete. Previous
reports, and the appendices to the present one, show how much has been
·done in this direction, but the Committee wants to do much more. It
wishes to place side by side four good patterns of instruments, and to

compare and study their records. When this is done it hopes to receive

the support of the Association in approaching Government with the view

to the establishment of a limited number of instruments identical in

sensitiveness, in this country, in India and in the Colonies, and of a small

Kewcentral office, at  or elsewhere, for co-ordinating and publishing the

results. As far as the Committee can at present judge, the equipment

of each station with complete apparatus for continuous photographic record

would not exceed 100^. For the experimental work of the coming year

the Committee have one instrument, and can have the use of another

(constructed under a grant to Professor Milne by the Royal Society) ; it
wishes to purchase two others, and will have to build piers. Arc, and pay

for photographic necessaries and an assistant to run the instruments,

which, altogether, would probably cost over 200i^. Your Committee

thinks it desirable that to meet unforeseen items it should have 250/., but

without 200/. the work cannot go on.

I. Notes on Instruments which will record Earthquakes of Feeble Intensity

    What we desire to record are preliminary tremors of small amplitude

followed by quasi-elastic waves of comparatively large a.mplitude.
     Within a hundred or two hundred miles of an origin, the former of

these have periods varying between ^ and -jV of a second. At a great
                                 --

183 REPORT-- 180G.

distance, say one quarter of the earth's circumference, these moAj have
periods of from 5 to 12 seconds.

     The latter near to an origin have periods -varying between \ and

2 seconds, whilst at a great distance this period may be 20 secondst As
an avei-age maximum -v-elocity for the propagation of the pi'eliminary
tremors, we shall take 11 km. or about 7 miles per second. The large

wave motion is propagated at about L of this rate.
     It has been found by trial that fifteen or twenty stations can l^e found

on the globe, so tliat one of these shall be near to the antipodes of sliocks
originating on the west coast of South America, Japan or the Pliilippines,
or the Western Himalaya, whilst six or seven other stations between on©
of these origins and its antipodes will lie at distances from each other of
between one thousand and two thousand miles.

    Because such an arrangement of stations is possible, we may take one
thousand miles as being the minimum difference in di.stance between

observing stations relatively to important seismic centres.

     With the assumed velocity of propagation of 7 miles per second, the
difference in times we expect to note will be about 143 seconds.

     Because some stations will be at shorter distances from each other
relatively to origins, I shall assume that instruments are required to note-
differences in time of 100 seconds.

We do not know which instrument would at a given station commence

to move the first. The probable order would be R, M, D, V.

Carts, trains and traffic, unless very near, do not affect any of the

instruments.

D Vand        are probably not affected by 'earth (?) tremors' whilst
M Rand are affected, but the serious character of these in obliterating

effects due to small movements has been greatly reduced.

   D Rand are most sensible to tilting effects like the diurnal wave, and

therefore, unless we reduce their multiplication by reducing tJie distance

between the miri'ors and the film, they require a broad recording surface.

   D is enth-ely unaffected by rapid tremors. The movement of the

image during the passage of earthquake pulsations is absolutely steady,

showing that the rapid vibrations superposed on the long waves (tiltingsof

the ground) are entirely quenched.
--VInstallation and tvorking.

   M requires 4 feet horizontally, a small light, and moderate isolation.

Each instrument will require about ten minutes' time daily, and about

one hour each week.

It is possible that the smoking and varnishing of a long roll of paper,

as required by V, may be more troublesome than developing the photo-
M R Dgraphic films of M, R, and D. The

relative merits of these instruments as earthquake recorders.

T UII. Observations iritJt Pendulums and in the Isle of Wight, 1895-96.

                                     The Localities and their Geology,

     The position of Shide Hill House, where instrument T is installed, is
approximately 50° 41' 18" N. Lat., and 1° 17' 10" W. Long. It is near
to the Shide railway station, at the foot of the western side of Pan Down,

which is a portion of the chalk backbone of tlie Isle of Wight.

    LTp on the Down the chalk reaches to within a few inches of the surface.
At Shide Hill House disintegrated chalk, which may have a thickness

of about G feet, is met with at a depth of 3 feet. In front of the house,
or towards the west, at a distance of about 150 yards at the other side of
a small stream, there is a railway. In a IST.E. direction, at a distance of
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  185

242 yards, there is a chalk quarry, where at certain fixed times blasting

takes 23lace.

    At the back of the house within a few yards of the buildings in
which the instrument is placed there is a lane down which on week days

carts heavily laden with gravel pass.
     Through the kindness of Mr. A. Harbottle Escourt, Deputy Governor

of the island, I was enabled to establish a second instrument (U) within
the grounds of Carisbrooke Castle. The foundation is similar to that at
Shide, being a brick column built up from the chalk. This stands in a
small room, one wall of which is the western wall of the castle. Towards
the east it faces the Bowling Gi^een.

     This instrument gave its first records about June 22, but it was not
in proper working order until the middle of July.

     Shide lies at a distance of 1^ mile in a N.N.E. direction from Caris-

brooke. Mount Joy, which is 274 feet high, lies between the two places.
    At Shide and continuing towards Carisbrooke the chalk ridge, which

forms the backbone of the island, strikes E.S.E. to W.N.W., and dips at
at a high angle approaching verticality towards the north. The central
portion of this anticline has been removed by denudation, whilst its
southei'n, which dips gently, can be seen in the Downs along the south

coast.

     The steep dip on the northern side of this anticline is a feature
common to the folds of the continuation of these rocks. Sudden mono-
clinal folds are generally recognised as representing movements, which
if continued result in faulting, and the home of faults is that of

earthquakes.

     The faults wliich are actually visible or inferred from the displace-
ment of beds in the Isle of Wighc are only seven or eight in number,
and the throw of those, excepting the one supposed to exist a few miles
«ast of Shide at Ashey, is but small (see ' The Geology of the Isle of

Wight,' by H. W. Bristow, revised and enlarged by Clement Eeid, and

Aubrey Strahan, 'Memoirs of the Geological Survey,' 1889).
     The structural and the stratigraphical conditions which I have per-

sonally observed at Shide and its neighbourhood are as follows. The

chalk is so sharply tilted that it is reasonable to suppose that limits of

its elasticity have often been exceeded. As a result of the pressure and

metamorphic actions accompanying this distortion, the chalk has been so
far hardened that when two pieces of it are struck together it has almost
the ring of crystalline limestone, the flints if not broken into fragments
have been brought together in patches, and have been so far fractured
that by the application of light blows they fall in pieces. Siliceous
matter has been deposited in veins, whilst slickensided surfaces in
various directions apparently indicate that from time to time strain has
been relieved by minor yieldings.

    At Alverton chalk pit, which lies to the west of Cai'isbrooke, the

<;haik dips northwards at about 45°. Parallel to the dip the strike, and
in intermediate directions the beds, are traversed by fracturer. which can
be traced over lengths of 20 yards.

     That these fractures are not mere cracks but are accompanied by
displacement, and therefore have the character of true faults, is shown in
one instance by the abrupt termination of a band of flint where it meets
one of these lines, in another case, as also at Shide, it is shown by the
smashing up of a mass of flint and the trailing out of the fragments of
186 REPORT-- 1896.

the same along the fractured face in a du'ection parallel to that of the
striations. The last indications of displacement are the striations them-

selves.

     The surfaces of these fractures are yellowish in colour, indicating that
they have formed channels for subterranean water, but notwithstanding
the solvent action accompanying such percolation tlie striations remain

singularly clear.

     The inference from this is that these fractures, which penetrate down-
wards to unknown depths, are of comparatively recent origin. In an
upward direction they can be traced to the lower portion of the disinte-
grated chalk, but they cannot be traced through this into the overlying
gravel and its thin capping of earth.

    Had these overlying materials been as resistant to fracture as the

hard chalk beneath them, it might be reasonably supposed that these
fractures had been produced before the deposition of the overlying
materials. In this instance, as in all other instances where deposits

of a soft and yielding character overlie strata of a much harder nature,
one of the usual arguments respecting the age of faults may fail. Very
large earthquakes are occasionally accompanied by dislocation which

reaches through the alluvium to the surface, but with the majority of
such disturbances, as with the fractui-es which accompany a subsidence
in a mine, the dislocations only extend upwards through rocks which are

in a state of strain. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that the dis-
integrated chalk and its overlying soft materials could only be disturbed

by faulting of an unusual charactei', and even in such instances, by
settlement, the percolation of water and surface denudation traces of the
same would be speedily obliterated.

     In the majority of instances traces of fracturing and even faulting
at considerable depths would not be visible near the surface. The faults
which have been observed in the chalk of the Isle of Wight anticline
.and in the overlying tertiaries, up to the Hampstead beds, which have
shai-ed its movements, are in all probability the natural records of earth-
quakes of considerable magnitude.

     Although geological evidence indicates that the Xsle of Wight fold
like those to the north of it was commenced in Miocene times, and was
contemporaneous with movements which led to the building of the

Italian peninsula and some of the largest mountain ranges in the world,
actual earthquakes which have been felt in the Isle of Wight are but

few in number. Dr. Groves, of Carisbrooke, who is familiar with the

island and its history, has failed to meet with any accounts of such dis-

turbances. Mr. Charles Davison, however, gives me the following list
of shakings, which, although they did not originate in Vectis, may

--have been felt there 1734, November 5 ; 1750, March 19 and 29 ;

 1755, November 1 (Lisbon); 1811, November 30; 1814, December G;
 1824, December 6 ; 1834, January 23 and August 27 ; 1853, April 1 ;

1884, April 22 (Colchester) ; 1889, May 29 (Channel Islands). On the

opposite coast during the last two hundred years, on the authority of

 Mr. J. E. Sawyer, it may be concluded that a shock of some violence has
on the average been felt once in every ten years. These were particu-

 larly noticeable about Chichester.
      The reason that earth shakings never appear to have originated in

 the Isle of Wight, possibly lies in the fact that the strata in which it
 seems so likely that dislocations should occur is almost entirely com-
       ON hEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  187

posed of materials wliicli are soft and yielding in their character, ainJ
tlierefore adjust themselves to new forms by crusliing and gliding rather

than by sudden fracturing.
     The appearance and structure of the Isle of Wight anticline is that

of a district in seismic strain, in which we might expect to lind adjust-
ments by intermittent and to some extent semi-viscous yielding. Later
on it will be shown that horizontal pendulums founded in this chalk

often exhibit sudden displacements, the cause of which is at present un-

known. These are much too local in their character to be called earth-

quakes, and it seems likely that they will prove to be settlements beneath,
or very near to, the foundations of the piers on which the instruments are-

placed.

               T UThe Tnstnnncnts and and their Installation.

     The instrument and the installation at Shide is designated by the-
letter T. Other horizontal pendulums of a similar type used in Japan
are indicated by the preceding letters of the alphabet.

188 REPORT-- 1896.

    Up to March 27, the boom constructed of varnished sti-aw and reed

was 2 ft. 5| in. long and weighed § oz. The balance weight weighed 2| oz.

With a period of 17 seconds a deflection at its outer end of 1 mm. corre-

sponded to a tilt of 0"-71.

     On April 24 this was replaced by an aluminium boom 3 feet in length,
weighing ^ oz. The balance weight weighs 8 oz. With a period of 31
seconds, a deflection of 1 mm. at its outer end corresponds to a tilt of

about 0"-2.

      The instrument stands upon the cement-covered top of a brick column,
which is 1 ft. 6 in. square and 6 feet high. This rises freely in a pit 3 feet
deep from a thin bed of concrete covering the surface of the disintegrated

Nchalk. The sides of the column are oriented S., and E W.

      The building in which this is placed is an old stable built with brick,

and sheltered by trees on its north, south, and west sides. From October

 1895 the southern face of the column was covered with cement, which like
the top was on that day coated with paint. The pit in which the column
rises is filled with dry straw and hay, whilst for some months the column
itself was wrapped round with a double thickness of thick felt.

    UAbout the end of June a second instrument which I call was in-

stalled at Carisbrooke Castle. It was made by Mr. R. W. Munro, of

Granville Place, King's Cross Road, London, W.C. In nearly all respects,
excepting that of better workmanship, it is similar to the one at Shide.
It stands on a brick column inside a building, one wall of which is
the western wall of the Castle, facing the bowling green. With a period
·of 8 seconds its sensibility is such that 1 mm. deflection of the boom

corresponds to a tilt of about 0''-5.

      The cost of working one of these instruments, which includes benzine,
bromide paper, used at the rate of 3 feet per day, and developers, is about
2s. 6d. per week. To wind and compare the watch, mark the bromide
papers with a date, and to refill the lamp, which has to be done daily,
·occupies about 10 minutes. Changing and developing the papei's once
a week can be done in about 45 minutes. The time occupied to analyse
-a diagram depends upon its nature and the exactitude required in the

necessary measurements. It may be 5 minutes or one hour. The walk to

HCarisbrooke and back takes about hour.

--Artificial JDisturbances. {Blasting), Train and Cart Effects.)

At a distance of 242 yards on the N.N.W. side of the instrument

there is a chalk quarry, at which when the present observations commenced

charges of powder of ^ lb. and upwards were fired. Since October 1 the

quantities of powder employed are said to have been reduced, and the

times of firing the same confined to the half hours between 9 and 9.30 a.m.

and 2 and 2.30 p.m.

Although I have several times had the opportunity of watching the

instrument within 20 seconds of one of these explosions I never observed

that any appreciable motion had been produced.

It may therefore be assumed that the instrument was not seriously

Anaifected by these operations.  assurance of this was obtained by com-

paring the following list of explosions very kindly made by Miss E. A.

spiders have sometimes found their way inside a case, but it is very doubt-
ful that they should be able to cause the sudden disturbances shown and
finally leave the boom in its normal position and free to swing. With
records from nineteen installations in Japan I never remember observing

movements of this character. ^Yhatever may be the cause of these dis-

placements it is probably very local in its operation, and therefore they

cannot be regarded as earthquakes.

The duration of a displacement is evidently the length of time it takes

a pendulum which has been slightly deflected to come to rest. AVith a

Hlight boom this is about minute but with a heavy boom it may be 5
Aminutes.

One group of 40 occupies 3 or 4 hours.

    An earthquake originating at a distance has the appearance of fig. 3,

which is probably the Shide record of the commencement of shocks which

shook Cyprus on June 29, 1896.

Between August 19, 1895, and March 27, 1896, or during 202 working

days, 485 sudden displacements and earthquakes were recorded.

In the following list the records referring to sudden displacements are

those -which succeed each other at short intervals, and are marked

* sudden ' or ' strong.' Those which are followed by the remark ' slight

or ' moderate ' may be clue to actual earthquakes, the origins of which in

some instances ha\e been at great distances.

hoped that these will be completed, whilst the list itself will be extended

pean countries, are very full, we naturally expect to meet with approxi-

mate coincidences in time between some of these shocks and those recorded

pt Shide. As examples of these coincidences, the shock of August 19
at 9-983h. and that of August 20 at 12-383h. may be taken. These two

shocks followed heavy disturbances which took place in Asia Minor by

intervals of about 28m. 32s. and 32m. 32s. Taking the distance between

the Isle of Wight and the western part of Asia Minor at ^th of the

earth'.s circumference and the velocity of a surface-wave at 2km. per

second, these intervals of time should have been 23m. or 24m. The dis-

crepancy of from 4m. to 8m. between what is observed and what would

be expected might be explained on the assumption that the times noted in

Asia Minor seem to be but roughly approximate. Several facts, however,

indicate that many of the disturbances noted in the Isle of Wight, although

they may agree in time with those catalogued by Agamennone, are not

identical with the same.

The Isle of Wight displacements commence suddenly and succeed each

other at widening intervals of time, both of which characters are sugges-

tive of shocks having a local origin. Farther than this, although certain

of them may have taken place at an interval of time roughly proportional

to the distance of an origin when there has been a heavy disturbance,

there are many in the same series where this proportionality does not

exist. For example, although it has been shown that two out of the

thirteen .shocks of August 19 and 20 might be identical with shocks

of those dates in Asia Minor, other shocks amongst the remaining

eleven follow those in Asia Minor at intervals exceeding one hour, whilst

some precede them. The important feature in the European and Isle of

Wight records is tlie approximate coincidence in time of groups of

shocks. On August 1 2 and 20 there were a succession of violent dis-

turbances in Asia Minor, and on the same dates we find a marked set of

disturbances in the folded and faulted strata of the Isle of Wight. For

the same places the same phenomenon is repeated on November 13 and 14.

In the Isle of Wight, on the former date, between 8.30 and 11.30 p.m.,

forty-four sudden tiltings were recorded, whilst in Asia Minor, between

9.30 on the 13th until the night of the 14th, there were violent shakings.

Observations of this character suggest the idea that either unfelt earth-

waves radiating from centre of violent activity disturb strata in a critical

condition in distant places, or that the relief of strain in one portion of

the globe cause readjustment in distant localities. Large earthquakes, like

that of 1755, have apparently caused secondary earthquakes, wliilst seis-

mological chronology tells us that there have been periods when earth-

quakes have been more frequent throughout the world than at others.

Copies of this list have been sent to several of the principal observa-

tories in Europe, where there is apparatus which might record similar

Updisturbances.  to date only three replies have been received, Avhich are

as follows :

Dr. Gerland, of Strassburg. This sketch shows the movements which

took place in a von Rebeur-Paschwitz pendulum on the morning of

October 20.

About 10 A.M. (S.M.T.) there were preliminary tremors, lasting about

five minutes. These were followed by strong movements, reacliing thirty

or more millimetres, which continued until about 11.30, during which

time the pendulum was displaced by four steps towards the south. From
this time the movement died out, but slight movements are observable
aintil alter 1.30 p.m. The duration of the disturbance was therefore at

least 3^ hours.

sufficiently sensitive to record the same disturbance.

   --September 4, 5, 7 and 8. It will be observed that on these days, from

which it must be noted September 6 is omitted, when there was practically

no movements, that shocks were very frequent. Dr. Gerland of Strass-

burg writes me that on these days there were many small shocks, and a

tendency for the pendulum to move towards the south.

recorded disturbances, commencing at 10.45 a.m. G.M.T., which reached a

maximum at about llh. 14m. p.m., ending about one hour later.
    At Shide a disturbance commenced at 10.30 a.m. G.M.T., but as the

instrument was dismantled at 11.30 the record is incomplete.

violent shock in Cyprus, which was followed by a series of others.

An alarming shock was felt at 8.25 a.m. on July 3, and others at noon,

12.38 P.M., 2.52 P.M., and 3.22 p.m.

On these days many small shocks were recorded at Shide. Assuming

a diiference in time between Cyprus and Greenwich of 2h. 1 2m., the above

range of half a millimetre. On August 23 the motion was continuous

are called tremors. Some of these are apparently due to the establish-

ment of air currents within the case of the instruments, while others

seem to have their origin in actual movements of the supporting pier.

Pulsations are slow movements which are regular in the period and
amplitude on the photogram, having an appearance like that produced by
a tuning fork recording its vibrations on a moving smoked surface.
These pulsations are referred to as such, or as waves. Often they are
distinct from tremors, but at other times they lead up to tremor storms,
and in such cases it becomes diflScult to distinguish between i^ulsations
and tremors.

in which tremors for successive days have been placed under columns
representing 24 hours, 12 hours being midnight. These tremors had
values assigned to them equal in millimetres to the range of motion

they exhibited on the photograms. By adding these columns up verti-

cally a value was obtained for the period considered for each hour of the
day and night. This value has been considered as proportional to the

intensity of motion exhibited at various hours. By simply adding up
the number of entries a set of numbers were obtained which may be

regarded as proportional to the tremor frequency.

     These two sets of numbers obtained for the months of November and
December 1895, when plotted on squared paper, give the curves shown in

fig. 8.

    From these curves we see that for the period considered tremors have

been least intense and least frequent between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m., but from

not necessarily a horizontal pendulum, but an ordinary pendulum, a
balance, and perhaps even a magnetometer, shows considerable motion
within its case, the question arises whether there be not air currents

existing within the cases which cover such instruments. With compara-
tively heavy horizontal pendulums in well ventilated cases in Japan
tremors were always small and of rare occurrence, but with light

pendulums in similar cases tremors of a pronounced character nearly

always occurred between midnight and about six in the morning. With
the light pendulum at Shide, beneath a fairly tight case, I found tremors,
whether the inside of this was lined with thick felt, and the supporting
pier covered with the same material, which kept the surroundings of the

instrument at a fairly uniform temperature, or whether such coverings
wei'e removed. Covering those portions of the column which were inside
the case with cement, and painting the surface of the same, did not
destroy the intruders. Another experiment was to replace the large

doors of the case Avitli fine gauze, thus giving the instrument considerable

ventilation ; but, as will be seen from the records (November 21-30), no

great improvement was effected. By means of a very fine column

of smoke from the spark at the end of a thin joss-stick, joints in the
covering cases were tested for draughts. The column of smoke was also
placed before a small hole usually closed by a cork, to see if there was any
tendency in the air to enter or come out from the case, but no indication
of the same was obtained.

     One very marked observation was that a strong tremor storm would
suddenly cease, or be at least greatly altered in its intensity, by opening
the door of the case for one or two minutes.

      Altiiough a sudden change of this last description has occurred with-

out opening the doors, we have in this observation an indication that
by some means or other, which do not seem to be effects due to differ-

ences in temperature in different parts of a case, air-currents are from
time to time established within a case, the mechanical working of which
can be more or less destroyed by simply opening the door of the case.

     One cause of such currents may be due to the differfent rates at

which aqueous vapour is absorbed or given off" at different points within

the covering, and if these are steady they may set up a steady set of long

period displacements in a light pendulum.

     By introducing a tray of calcium chloride inside the case, violent

movements ha\e resulted, which only ceased after the desiccating agent
was removed.

      These facts, coupled with tiie fact that tremors were apparently

greatly reduced by surrounding the boom with a trough or wind-guard on

three of its sides, lead to the conclusion that air-currents are from time
to time generated within casings such as I have employed, which result
ill movements which are with difficulty separable from those which are
attributed to motion of the supporting pier.

     The fact that tremors occur when there is a slight fall in temperature
outside the case, whilst the fall inside the same would be comparatively

 small, suggests the idea that at such times, although they have failed

detection, there may be streams of air passing through the joints of the

 coverings. The unlikelihood of this is, however, referred to in the next

 .section.

     ' In some instances, however, the opening of the door seems to have brought
a tremor storm into existence.

                  Atmosphere, Temperature, Frost, Dew, Wind, and Hain.

     From November 18, 1895, a self-recording barometer, thermometer, and
hygrometer of the Richard types were established at Shide, The two
latter instruments usually stood upon the case covering the horizontal
pendulum, but for one or two weeks they were placed inside the covering.
The tremors have been written, with their magnitudes, on the diagrams

showing changes in temperature. Altliougli these changes, which are
indicated in degrees Fahrenheit, have been within a period of twelve or
twenty-four hours small, it must be remembered that the corresponding

changes which have sometimes taken place outside the building may have

Hbeen comparatively large. The following notes, in which T, B, and

respectively mean temperature, barometer, and hygrometer, are based

upon an inspection of these records :

                     changes, and the tremors chiefly occur with the falls.

    The conclusions which may be derived from these notes are :

     1. There does not appear to be any relationship between the indica-

tions of the hygrometer and tremors. When the door of the observing

room was often left open during the day, at such times the hygrometer
                 ON SEISM OLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.      211

would indicate considerable changes, which are the times at which tremors

are least frequent.

     2. Tremors have occurred when tlie barometer has been high, low,
rising or falling. These observations, however, do not throw any light
upon the connection which may exist between the appearance of tremors

and the state of the barometric gradient.
     3. Tremors nearly always appear when the temperature is falling, and

therefore are frequent at night. When the temperature is steady or

rising, tremors have been but seldom observed.
     The observation that tremors accompany a falling thei-mometer receives

strong confirmation that they have been markedly large on frosty nights,
and that these sometimes have continued whilst the morning sun has been
thawing the frozen surface of the ground. Such coincidences occurred
on January 20, 28, 29, 30, 31, February 22, 23, 24, 25, March 14 and 18.

     The only exceptions to this rule appear on November 2.5, January 14
and 15, on which occasions the fall in temperature was from 50° to 49°

and 48°, which, it may be remarked, are only small changes.
     From January 20 to 22 tremors were pronounced, whilst the tem-

perature was steady at about 45°. Although there was this approximately
constant temperature in the room, and a temperature yet more constant
within the case, on the night of the 20th there was a hard frost, and

possibly frost on the other nights. For each of these days it may therefore

be assumed that between the day and night, outside the building, the
change in temperature was great. The large differences in temperature
between the outside and inside of the building no doubt resulted in the

establishment of air-currents through a broken pane of glass and other

air passages, but, as these do not appear to have disturbed the inside

temperature, such air- currents must have been small. Rather, therefore,

than looking to such currents as being the cause of the movements of the
pendulum, it seems more reasonable to suppose them due to expansions

and contractions which were taking place in the ground outside.
      Tremors have also occurred on nights which have been accompanied

with heavy dew, as, for example, on March 9. This may possibly mean

that when large quantities of aqueous vapour are escaping from the

ground, as evidenced by copious condensation on its chilled surface, con-

tractions or expansions may be taking place in the same.

    My note book also shows, as it has repeatedly shown in previous

 years, that tremors have been marked or entirely absent with heavy winds

from different directions and at the time of calms.

   A long drought followed by heavy rain has been followed by slight

tremors.

The conclusions that are arrived at respecting the cause of tremors

are yet wanting in certitude.
     It is probable that naturally produced elastic tremors with a high

frequency have an existence in localities remote from earthquake centres,
but this has not yet been demonstrated. The only records bearing upon

such an investigation are a few taken at Shide. These are referred to

when describing the Perry Tromometer.

The long-continued movements which are so often observed with light

horizontal pendulums are probably due to the same causes which produce

movements in ordinary pendulums, delicate balances, and, as the Rev. W.
KewSidgreaves tells us, in suspended magnets beneath aii'-tight covers at

and Stonyhurst,

--212 REPORT 189G,

     As the result of many observations, I venture to suggest that the

 causes of the so-called ' earth tremors ' are twofold :

      1. Air-currents within the cases. Such currents are produced by a
 cold current of air impinging upon the outside of covers like glass or thin
 metal, but they are not likely to be produced if the covering is made of
 thick wood lined witli thick felt. They may be produced by an inflow or
 outflow of air through ill-fitting joints, but what is more likely, as experi-
 ment has shown, by a difference in the rate at which moisture is con-

 densed, absorbed, or given off at different points within a cover.

     2. By movements in the superficial soil outside the building in which

 the instrument is installed. These movements take place in soil whilst it is

 freezing or thawing, and after a heavy shower on dry ground. They may
 also be produced at the time when there are rapid but small changes in

 barometric pressure over an area the different portions of which vary in
 their elasticity and resilience.

     Although these suggestions partially destroy the value of many records
 of ' earth ' tremors, they nevertheless leave us confronted with phenomena
which it is the interest of all who have to work with instruments having

delicate suspensions to understand more clearly, especially, perhaps, the
reason that their frequency is so marked at particular hours and seasons.

                        Diunial Wave and Wanrlering of the Pe7iduluvi.

     On May 24, 1896, a drum moving a bromide film at a rate of about
'75 mm. in twenty-four hours was placed beneath pendulum T, and records

were taken until June 15. The sensibility of the instrument was such
that 1 mm. deflection indicated a tilt of 0"-56.

     The records yield the following results :--

     The differences in temperature whicli are in degrees Fahrenheit are

those recorded in the instrument loom between about <S a.m. a)id 2 p.m.
     Fig. 9 shows tracings from the photograras of diurnal wav(!s observed

h,t Shide. The range of motion lias varied between 1 ' and ;!". Usually
the Western motion ceased about 10 a.m., from which hour the pendulum
moved eastwards until about 7 or 8 p.m. The motion from 10 a.m. or noon
is therefore similar to that which would accompany a decrease in the
steepness of the open bare down on the eastern side of the pendulum, or
a rising of the tree and grass covered valley on its western side. The fact
that the movements were usually pronounced on bright fine days, and but

feeble or absent when it was dull or wet. suggests the idea that the ob-

served movements may have been the result of the removal l)y evapoiatiou

of different loads from the two sides of the station. The niuplitude of the
daily wave is far from being proportional to the daiiv range of tempera-

ture observed near to the instrument.

    From May 24 to June 7 the pendulum gradually nio\pd westwards,
and during this time the maximum temperature gradually rose from

60° to 70°, that is to say, the direction of motion has been the same as
that which takes place whilst the temperature is rising during the day.
The creeping of the pendulum between the above two dates is in such a
--214 REPORT 1896.

direction that it might be attributed to the removal of a larger load from

the hill side of the instrument than from the valley side.

Between June fi and 7 the maximum temperature fell to 65°, from

which it rose to 68° on the 11th. During this time, however, the pendu-
lum crept eastwards, or in the opposite direction to that in which, under

similar conditions, it had been previously moving. From June 1 1 to 13

the temperature rose from 65° to 72°, whilst the pendulum remained

stationary.

    What these observations show for a period of only twenty- one days is

true for longer periods, as observed in Japan, and generally agrees with

the observations made at Strassburg, described by the late Dr. E. von

Rebeur-Paschwitz. At this latter place, for a period of nineteen months,

the character of the curve of wandering is similar to that for a curve of

temperature                                                          but when we  observe, as  this  author  points  out, that  the

Hminimum of temperature is reached from to 2 mouths before a mini-
mum in the curve, showing the displacement in the pendulum, whilst its

maximum is reached about four months later, the relationship between

the two becomes obscured. This and other results obtained at, Strass-

burg are shown in fig. 10, reduced from the observations of von Rebeur.

these three sets of observations were made with instruments near to each

other, the difference of the Nadir curve from the other two is very strik-

having been tilted towards the south through 87', and if we take it from

the commencemejit of the observations in April, 1892, this is increased

to 1 43".

   III. Changes in the Vertical observed in Tokio, September 19, 1894, to

                                          March 1, 1896.

   --Peiidulum L. On September 19, 1804, pendulum L, which has a

boom about 5 feet in length, was installed beneath a wooden case on the
concrete floor of a cellar in the N.W. corner of the College of Engineering

at the Imperial University of Japan, in Tokio. When set up it had a

period of about twenty-eight seconds, and 1 mm. deflection at the end of
the boom which is in the meridian corresponds to an angular tilt of about

0"*5. The doubt expressed regarding the value of the readings of this instrvi-
ment arises fi-om the fact that the notes relating to its calibration were lost

by tire. When the readings increase in value the ^^sndulum is swinging
towards the west, which means that the ground may have been raised

upon its eastern side. The diurnal motions of this instrument were small,
not exceeding 1 or 2 mm. For several days readings taken about 9 a.m.
have been identical, after which there would be noted a displacement of

1 or more mm. For the first nine months these ajiparently sudden dis-

placements were towards the east. This was followed by three months
of westerly motion, and then three months more of displacements towards
the east. For the remaining three months, although the general direction
of motion is westwards, it has been somewhat erratic in character.

     The readings given in the following table are in millimetres, and
the date for any reading is the day on which there was a change from the
reading which precedes it.

   A fact of some importance connected with these displacements is that

very many of them took place at the time of earthquakes which were
sensible, and most of these small jumps were in the general direction in

     This last reading is unsatisfactory. Five minutes later it became 55-5,
but if the north side load showed an effect it ought to have exceeded 56.

     In the afternoon a few experiments were made in the main building of
the Observatory. The horizontal pendulum was placed on the top of a
massive pier whilst two boys and a man (almost 350 lb.) stationed them-
selves in the basement of the building, first on the east side and then on
the west side of the same. The difference in readings given by the two
positions was approximately 0''-16.

V. The Perry Tromometer. By Professor John Perry, F.K.S.

What is interesting about the apparatus is this, that any periodic

motion of the supports is faithfully indicated by the pointer if its frequency

is several times the natural frequency of vibration when its supports are

at rest.

One body supported on a pivot with three Ayrton-Perry springs will

record the vertical and two horizontal motions.
A body P G Q is free to move about an axis P at right angles to the

Athe natural frequency of Q is less than one-fifth of the frequency of and P]

we may say that the motion y which is observed is a faithful imitation of

   A magnifying pointer on the spring enables this motion to be

observed.

    It is obvious that the motion may be in a horizontal plane instead

of a vertical.

                             Note. By Professor Jons' Milne.

   A form of Perry Tromometer as experimented with at Shide consists of

a hoiizontal beam free to oscillate upon a knife edge. This beam is
heavily loaded by two unequal masses which to obtain a balance are
placed at different distances from the knife edge. Attached to one of
these masses and running vertically upwards is a light A. P. spring, the
top end of which is held by a fixed support. To show the movements of
the spring which coils or uncoils with vertical vibratory motion, a very
light pointer, or a small mirror from which a beam of light is reflected, is
attached to the same. One photogram representing a period of twenty-
four hours has been obtained by this instrument at Shide. This shows
that during nearly the whole of the day the mirror is in motion, and the

fact that this motion is due to passing carts, carriages at a distance of
.several hundred yards, and trains at a distance of about a mile speedily
led to the conclusion that an instrument so extremely sensitive to rapid

elastic motion could not be used at Shide. One interesting observation
was that, at the time of the funeral of Prince Henry of Battenberg, when
minute guns were being fired on ship-board at a distance of about five
miles, each sound wave was accompanied by the sudden displacement of
the spot of light through a distance of about one foot. It did not seem
that vibrations came from their origin through the ground to disturb the
instrument, but as sound waves through the air, which shook the building
and the foundation on which the instrument rested.

     If an instrument of this description could be installed at a locality where

we can assure ourselves that its movements could only be due to natural

causes, it seems likely that we should add to our records of the movements
of the earth's crust forms of vibration which horizontal pendulums and

seismographs are incapable of recording.

       VI. Eartliquake Frpqiiency. {Extract from a letter written by

                                             Dr. 0. G. Knott.)

    In my paper on Earthquake Frequency ('Trans. Seis. Soc. Japan,' vol. ix.

1884), in which, probably for the first time, a sound mathematical treat-
ment of periodicity was insisted upon, various possible causes of periodi-
city in earthquake frequency were considered. Next to the solar annual
and diurnal periods, the most important are the lunar monthly, fortnightly,

and daily periods. From lack of completeness of information at that time^.
it was impossible to search for these. But the great eight years' list of

8,331 Japanese earthquakes, prepared recently by Professor Milne, seemed
eminently suitable for harmonic treatment. Other necessary work has

prevented me getting the investigation carried out so quickly as I had

wished, but enough has been done to show the probable results in certain

directions.

     The idea is that the tidal stresses due to the moon influence the perio-
dicity. The lunar day gives a periodic tidal stress of comparatively short
period ; the anomalistic month (from apogee to apogee) and the nodical
month (from ascending node to ascending node), give periodic tidal

stresses of long period.

     Tabulating the earthquakes according to the number of days each has
happened after apogee, or after ascending node, we get two statistical
tables of monthly means, one nearly 100 months. The anomalistic month
is longer than the nodical month by almost exactly one-third of a day
in the hundred months, therefore, one will have gained upon the other by
thirty days, or fully one month. The curves obtained, when created by
harmonic analysis, give monthly, fortnightly, and weekly periods ; but
the fortnightly is more marked in the nodical curve than in the anoma-

listic.

     In discussing the daily lunar period, Ave must take account of the dis-
tricts in which the earthquakes occur, for only in this way can we compare
their times of occurrence with the time of meridian passage, or the time

of high water. In the case of the Tokio and Yokohama district, there is

evidence of a half daily period ; but the investigation is still far from

complete.

            VII. Instruments used in Italy. By Dr. C. Davisox.

      In the following pages a description is given of a few of the principal
instruments used in Italy for the registration of pulsations proceeding-
from more or less distant origins.

    Many of the instruments erected in that country are long vertical

pendulums, the movements of which are magnified and registei'ed in
different ways. The length is made as great as circumstances will allow,

so that for rapid vibrations the bob may be practically a steady point, and
the bob is made as heavy as possible, so as to lessen the fi-iction intro-
duced by the mechanical registration. Those who have used these pendu-

lums claim that they possess the following advantages over the horizontal'
pendulum and other instruments designed for photographic registration.

     1. They are much less expensive to work ; the cost of the paper on
                                                                                                                    --
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        :

                 ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.                                                                    221

wliich the records are made being only about a franc or a franc and a half

4% month.

     2. Any person can superintend and adjust them easily.

     3. They are not subject to the displacement of the zero-line.
     4. Owing to the great velocity which can be given to the paper, the
epoch of the different phases of the movement can be determined with

great accuracy.

5. They allow all the minute details of the movement to be studied.

      It is obvious that these, especially the two last, are great advantages.

On the other hand, the long pendulums are subject to several objections

·as compared with the horizontal and bifilar pendulums.

     1. Owing to their great length (Professor Riccd's seismometrograph

at Catania is 26 metres long), they are difficult to install, and indeed

I'equire a building almost specially constructed for the purpose.

     2. They are much less delicate than the horizontal and bifilar

pendulums.

     3. The latter are also adapted for other purposes e.g., investigating

--the bending of the ground by barometric and tidal loading and this will

facilitate their adoption at astronomical observatories, where, from the

*ase with which the exact time can be ascertained, it is most desirable

that they should be established.

The instruments I propose to describe are : (1) Professor G. Vicen-

tini's microseismograph                                                                                (2) Dr.  G.  Agamennone's seismometrograph,
                                                                                                    ;

(3) Dr. A. Cancani's seismometrograph, and (4) Professor G. Grablovitz's

geodynamic levels. It will be seen that the first of these is more or less

free from the above-named objections.

     Some further details with regard to the construction of the instrument
are taken from two letters written by Professor Vicentini to Professor

Milne.

     Professor Vicentini was led to design this instrument owing, he says,
to the difHculty of obtaining good photographic registration, the incon-
--222 REPORT 1896.

venience of working in the dark, and of using an apparatus which does
not give its record until the sensitive paper is developed, and to the great
expense of the photographic paper, the chemical reagents, and the source

of light.

     His first experiments were made with an ordinary tromometer, about

1-50 metre long, and with a bob 50 kg, in weight. The support of the

pendulum was fixed in a wall of the University buildings of Siena, over-

looking a much frequented road, on the third lloor, and about 20 metres
Aabove the ground.
                    short straw, terminating in a fine steel wire, was

attached to the bottom of the bob, and the movements of the point of the

wire were observed by means of a totally-reflecting prism and
AFig. 13. microscope provided with a micrometer.
                                                  tromometer of

this kind does not give at any instant the true state of vibra-

tion of the ground, its movements being aflected by previous

disturbances. But if the pendulum be obliged to perform a

very little work, such as the movement of the light vertical

lever described below (tig. 13), the bob is rendered much more

insensible to the rapid vibrations of the point of suspension.

Substituting this lever for the straw referred to above, the

movements of the lower end were observed with the micro-

scope. The superiority of this arrangement is very evident.

When a carriage, for instance, approaches from a distance, ·

the point of the lever at first vibrates parallel to the wall,

then in a plane more and more inclined to it, until, when the

carriage is just opposite the building, the vibrations are per-

formed normally to the wall and are synchi'onous with tlie

trampling of the horses. When the vibration of the ground

ceases, the movement of the lever ceases contemporaneously.

Thus, by the application of this vertical lever, the bob of the
pendulum is transformed almost into a steady mass, and its
steadiness during movements of the ground is further pro-
moted by the addition of the two horizontal levers which give
the component movements in two directions at right angles

                    to one another.
                        In the complete microseismograph erected in the University

                  of Siena, the bob of the pendulum weighs 50 kg., and is sup-
                   ported by three chains, united at their upper ends in a brass

                cap, to which is attached an iron wire about 2 mm. in diameter.

                    This is fastened to a screw in a strong iron bracket driven into

                  the wall. The length of the pendulum is about 1-50 metre.

By means of the screw the bob can be raised or lowered. Immediately

below the latter are fixed two iron bars to support it, and prevent damage

to the registering apparatus in case the suspending wire or chains should
break. The bob is also surrounded by an iron ring carrying three screws,

whose oflice is to prevent excessive displacements of the pendulum. When

the pendulum is connected with the recording levers it performs complete

oscillations in 2*4 seconds.

     Fig. 13 shows the vertical amplifying lever referred to above. It

consists of a thin tube of aluminium A, soldered at its upper end to a ring

B of the same metal. To its lower end is fixed a sewing-needle, DE,
whose cylindrical part has a diameter of 06 mm. The ring B is traversed

at its highest point by a second needle, FG, exactly similar to the first.
Its point, G, penetrating a short way inside the ring, rests in a small

glass cup carried by a support fixed to the wall. The position of the cup

can be adjusted by screws, both horizontally and vertically. The base of

the bob is slightly conical, and in its centre a hole is made, covered by a

sheet of brass, in which a small hole with bevelled edges is made which

clasps the needle, FG, at the point H. By means of the adjusting screws

The movements of the lower end of the vertical lever are magnified by
two light horizontal levers (fig. 14), which give the components of its

motion in directions at right angles to one another. It should be mentioned

that this figure is not drawn exactly to scale, and illustrates the slightly

different arrangement in a new microseismograph recently erected at

Padua.

     One of the levers, K, is rectilinear, and the other, K', bent at right
angles. In the Siena instrument they are made of thin aluminium plate,

terminating, at the ends L and L', in two very thin burnished steel

needles, parallel to one another, and separated by a distance equal to the

thickness of the needle, DE, of the vertical lever. The vertical axis, M,

consists of a fine steel needle, the lower point of which rests in the
conical cavity of a small glass cup fixed to the plate, P. The axis, M', is
exactly similar, but the lower end rests in a glass cup, whose height above
the plate, P, can be adjusted by a screw. The levers are provided with
-counterpoises, N, N', N". The needle, DE, of the vertical lever passes
through the slits, L, L', and thus any displacement of the end, E, is
decomposed by the horizontal levers into two components at right ano-les

·to one another.

     At the free ends of the aluminium arms of the levers, fibres of glass are

fixed at right angles to them with melted wax. In the apparatus after-
wards erected at Padua (to which fig. 14 refers), these glass fibres are
replaced by broad but thin strips of glass, the terminal parts being drawn
out as fibres.

     In the horizontal levers the length of the long arm is about five times
that of the short arm ; the movements of the wall supporting the apparatus

·are therefore magnified about eighty times.

     The smoked paper on which the records are made is a continuous
strip, and is driven by a drum which revolves by clockwork. The drum

is placed so that the pens rest on its highest horizontal generator, and the

fibres are made of such thickness and length that, with the slight friction

to be overcome, they do not bend. To diminish their friction they are

fused at the tip                                                             the smooth surface of  a  \ery small     sphere of  glass thus

slides on tlie smoked paper. To equalise the friction of the two pens, that
Kof the pen
             is first regulated by raising or lowering the support on

which the plate P rests by means of the levelling screws with whicli it is

provided. The contact of the other pen is then adjusted by moving the

glass cup on which the axis M' rests. The clock which drives the drum

may be of any kind, but, in order to measure tlie time, a chronograph is

connected with a good pendulum clock which closes an electric circuit,

and thus causes a stroke to be made on the paper every minute. At each

hour a double mark is made.

     The strip of paper is unrolled at the rate of about 2 mm. a minute.

The pens leave on the paper a fine but very clear trace. When heavy

carts pass by the University buildings the lines are simply widened, the
lampblack being completely carried away. In the case of earthquake

movements, however, the separate oscillations are clearly perceptible,
though the more rapid ones are only to be seen with the aid of a lens.

Pig. 15 reproduces the diagram obtained at Siena of the Japanese earth-

quake of March 22, 1894. The toothed line in the middle shows the
strokes which mark consecutive minutes. This figure may be compared
with the record of the same earthquake obtained by means of the horizontal
pendulum at Nicolaiew.'

     Beside the microseismograph above described. Professor Vicentini has

recently erected a new instrument at Padua, designed, not for obtaining

the times of the different phases of a disturbance, but for determining

with greater exactness the direction in which the movement takes place.
The mass of the new pendulum is 100 kg., and its length 3-36 metres. It

contains a vertical amplifying lever, like the first instrument, but for the

horizontal levers a small pantagraph was substituted at Dr. Pacher's
suggestion. This is made of aluminium tubes, weighs about eight deci-

                                                                             ' See Brit. Assoc. Hejf., 1894, p. 15G.

the vertical lever. The rate of the smoked

paper is increased to about 15 mm. a

minute, a velocity which enables the pen-

dular oscillations to be distinctly traced.

graph. The latest form of this instrument

is described in a paper, ' Sopra un nuovo

tipo di sismometrografo ' (' Boll. Soc. Bismol.

Ital.,' vol. i. 1895, pp. 160-168). It was in-

stalled at Rome about two years ago in
the tower of the CoUegio Romano. Owing

to the difficulty of reproducing the illustra-

tion of this pendulum, several of the details

of construction are necessarily omitted in

the following account :

The bob of the pendulum consists of six

discs of lead, weighing altogether nearly

200 kg. This heavy mass is suspended by

an iron rod 7 or 8 mm. in diameter and 16

metres in length, but to make the pendulum

more sensitive the upper end of the rod is

prolonged as a steel wire 2 or 3 mm. in

diameter, and 50 or 60 cm. long. At the

lower end the rod terminates in a smooth

cylinder of steel of about the same thick-

ness, passing through slits made in the

short arms of two horizontal levers. These

levers, which turn with very little friction,

are mounted on a strong frame provided

with screws for securing the verticality of

the axes about which the levers rotate. The

longer arms of the levers are about 35 cm.

in length, being about twelve times as long

as the short arms. They are triangular in

form, and are made of very thin brass

tubes. The levers are bent, so that while

the short arras are at right angles to one

another, pens at the ends of the long arms

record the components of the movement on

the same strip of moving paper. The pens

are supplied with ink of different colours

to avoid confusion of the records if the

pens should happen to cross one another.

In order to prevent the pens leaving the

strip of paper, the movements of the pen-

Adulum are limited by four screws.

strong box is placed immediately below the

heavy mass to save the instrument from

further damage in case the steel wire

should break.

The strip of paper on which the pens

record the movements of the pendulum is driven by a cylinder about

8 cm. in diameter, and rotating about a horizontal axis. The part of the

Fig. 16.  paper on which the record is being made lies on a

          rectangular platform immediately above the driving

          cylinder. Two pens fixed to the platform record the

          time every half-hour on the edges of the strip of

          paper. As a rule the cylinder rotates once in an

          hour, so that the paper is driven at the rate of about

          30 cm. an hour. But when a shock occurs the

          velocity of the cylinder is immediately increased, so

          that for three revolutions it revolves once a minute,

          thus unrolling the paper at the rate of about 5 cm. a

                      minute.

   1 The increased velocity is produced by means of a

                    roller, started by an electrical seismoscope. This

          consists in the longer arms of the levers beiiig con-

          tinued backwards to a length about fifteen times as

          great as that of the short arms. Beside, and very

          near the further ends, are two small vertical rods,

          which turn at their lower ends about a horizontal

          Aaxis.  A'ery slight movement of the levers closes

          an electric circuit, and at the same instant sets in

          motion the roller which gives the increased velocity,

          moves a collar which at once withdraws the vertical

          rods, so that they do not impede the oscillations of

          the multiplying levers, and also starts a clock pre-

          viously pointing to xii. The latter clock thus gives

          the time at which the increased velocity began.
               The increased velocity continues, as already men-

          tioned, for three minutes. At the end of this time

          the two vertical rods return to their original position.

          But if the pendulum is still in motion, electrical

          contact is immediately remade, the rods are again

          withdrawn, and the increased velocity re-established,

          so that with instantaneous interruptions this lasts

          until the movement is so slight that it ceases to start

          the seismoscope.

               Dr. A. Cancani'a Seisi^wmetrograph. The chief

          difference in principle between this instrument and

          the preceding consists in the omission of the arrange-

          ments for increasing the velocity at the time of a

          disturbance. Seismometrographsof this pattern have

5                 been in use for some time in the the geodynamic

          in observatory of Rocca di Papa near Rome. Two

          apparatus of larger dimensions have recently been

I constructed, one for Rocca di Papa and the other

             for the observatory at Catania. These are described

4'5 mm. in diameter. Near its lower end, the wire passes through slits

in the short arms of two horizontal levers. The long arms of the levers

are made of two very light brass tubes which, soldered to a small metal

plate, form a very elongated isosceles triangle in a horizontal plane. The

short arms are inclined at 45° to the long arms in opposite directions, so

that, while the former are at right angles to one another, the latter are

parallel.  The weight of each lever is  25 grammes                                                  the length of the long

arm is 40 cm., and its ratio to that of the short arm is at present 10 to

1 ; but this ratio can, if desired, be increased to 20 to 1. At the free
end of the long arm is a small V-shaped frame, which carries a light pen

furnished with a counterpoise, similar to those used in the meteorological

instruments constructed by MM. Richard of Paris, The levers are

arranged so that they are perfectly free throughout their whole range,

passing one over the other without striking.

The instrument at Catania differs only in details. The pendulum is

26 metres long and 300 kg. in mass, and the horizontal levers are made

of thin aluminium plate.

In both apparatus, the strip of paper on which the registration is

made is 14 cm. in breath, and is driven by a brass cylinder 60 cm. in

Acircumference, which rotates once an hour.   strip of paper, which costs

one franc, lasts for about seven days, and can be used at least four times,

twice on each side, so that the daily cost is less than four centimes.

Paper is also wrapped round the driving cylinder to prevent the loss of

any part of the diagram, in case the moving strip should come to an end

unexpectedly.

For ten seconds at the beginning of every hour, the traces are inter-

rupted, the levers being raised from the paper by means of a system of

levers connected electrically with a chronometer. The experience of five

yeai's with another instrument shows that this is the best of the methods

which have been devised for marking the time. The subsequent move-

ment of the levers does not seem to be in the least affected by their

removal, and the missing part of the diagram is so small that it can be

reconstructed with ease.

The diagrams corresponding to distant earthquakes which are obtained

with this seismometrograph are too large to be conveniently reproduced.

The velocity of the paper being so great (60 cm. an hour),' the diagrams

are exceedingly clear, showing the individual undulations so distinctly

that all the elements of the motion and the epochs of the different phases

can be determined with great precision.

in diameter with a rim 3 cm. high, ai-e placed in the vessels at each

end, and these again are surrounded with a stratum of oil. In the centre

Dof the float there rests a weight F of 100 grammes, connected by a wire

with the end of the short arm of the amjalifying lever G, the fulcrum of
Hthe lever being fixed to a plate
                                   resting on top of the vessel A. The

arms of the levers are 3 mm. and 15 cm. in length, so that the movements

of the float are magnified fifty times. The longer arms of the levers were

at first furnished with pens filled with ink, but for these were afterwards

substituted points writing on smoked paper, which give much clearer

diagrams. The paper is wrapped round a cylinder K, rotating on a,

vertical axis once in 53 minutes, and drives the paper under the pen at

the rate of 5^ mm. a minute. The levers of the two levels are arranged

with their pens on the same vertical line, and about 6 cm. from one another.

revolution is made, a cylinder L, 4 cm. in diameter, is lowered from a

drum, driven by another clock, into. the vessel B. As it becomes immersed

cylinder rotates once in 53 minutes the diagram for each component

consists of twenty-seven lines, the distance between consecutive lines

being about a millimetre. To determine the time of any displacement of

the float, a trace is impressed when the paper is put on and taken ofi", as

well as at some intermediate time about equidistant from the ends of the

24 hours. Or, if desired, an automatic hourly trace could be made by

electric connection with a chronumeter.

     The lines of the spiral are parallel and equidistant. Except when the

                            instrument requires sensitising, the registra-

severe earthquake in Carniola on April 14, 1895 (see lig. 18, in which the

however, obtained before the employment of smoked paper, so that it is
not so clear as that of a similar earthquake at the present time

  2S0 REPORT-- 1896.

    --The reason that phase No. 1 is not shown at Shide and it can only be

  seen in the Carisbrooke record with the help of a strong magnifying-glass

 -- is apparently due to the fact that the Shide lamp gives a light which is

  smaller and therefore feebler than that at Carisbrooke. The photograms
  from the latter station have therefore a definition sharper than those from
  Shide. Carisbrooke records are also freer from ' tremors ' than those at Shide.

       Phases 2 and 3 respectively differ by 4 and 17 seconds ; but inasmuch as
  the Carisbrooke time was regulated by comparisons with an ordinary watch,
  it is remarkable that these well-defined periods are so closely coincident.

       The difference in duration at the two stations is also jjrobably due to

  difference in definition of the photograms.

       I do not know where this shock originated, but because the daily
  papers tell us that there was a severe earthquake in Japan on Augu.st 31,

  and because the preliminary tremors have outraced the principal motion

 --by 34 minutes which indicates an origin at a distance of about 6,000
 --miles the inference is that the above records refer to an exceedingly

  violent adjustment of crumpling strata, probably in Japan. If this

 inference is correct, then in that country, in its own time, a violent earth-
 quake took place on August 31 at a few minutes past 5 p.m.

      The Committee divided the work of Sections III. and IV. among its
 members. Electro-chemical thermo-dynamics and electric endosmose were
 assigned to Mr. Shaw, the theory of migration and ionic ^'elocities to Mr.
 Whetham, and the discussion of apparatus and methods to Mr. Fitzpatrick.

     Mr. Whetham has completed the account of the theory of migration,

 <fcc., and Mr. Fitzpatrick has dealt with the methods of measuring electrical
 resistance of electrolytes. With regard to the section upon the numerical
 relations of electrical conductivity with other properties of electrolytes
the Committee are of opinion that very valuable results would be obtained
by cai-rying out measurements of the several properties upon identical
solutions with special precautions to protect the experiments against the
effects of small impurities. They have learnt that Mr. E. H. Griffiths
intends, in the course of the coming year, to make a series of observations
on the freezing-points of solutions, and it is thought that the opportunity
of making electrical nieasui-ements upon the same solutions should not be

allowed to pass. Mr. Whetham will undertake the electrical portion of

the work, and it is proposed to apply for a grant of bOl. towards the cost

of the special apparatus necessary for it.

     It is also proposed to print forthwith, and circulate among those most

likely to be interested, revised proofs of the portions which have been
completed, but not to include them in the published Report for this year.
It is intended to publish them in the Report for 1897, v/ith the remainder
of the work that the Committee are able to put before the Association.

     The Committee therefore ask for reappointment, with the addition of

                      Introductory Eemarhs : ' Non-cyclic ' Effect.

An§ 1. analysis of the results from the Kew declination and hori-

zontal force magnetographs during the selected ' quiet ' days of the five
years, 1890 to 1894, was submitted last year to the Committee and
adopted as its report for 1895. The corresponding inclination and
vertical force results had also been pretty fully worked up, but I held
them over pending an inquiry into the sufficiency of the temperature

correction. Some considerable time may elapse before these results can

be utilised to full advantage. It has thus seemed inexpedient to defer
dealing with one set of phenomena whose general character is unaffected
by any uncertainty as to the temperature correction, and whose existence
seems to render desirable a reconsideration of the whole system of ' quiet
day observations. The phenomena in question bear on what I termed

last year the non-cyclic effect.

    Supposing Ho and H24 to denote mean values of the horizontal force

at the first and second midnights of a selected series of days, then

--H24 Ho was defined as the non-cyclic effect or variation of horizontal

force ; and a similar definition applies in the case of any other element.

         Non-cyclic Effects during Six Years, 1890-1895.

§ 2. It is proposed to give here complete data as to the non- cyclic

Keweffects in the selected ' quiet ' days at  during the last six years. To

some extent this incorporates results given last year, but it seemed
       --'

--232 REPORT 1896.

desirable to show side by side the results for all the elements throughout
the same series of years.

     There are five selected ' quiet' days a month, and so a total of 360 in
the seventy-two months of the six years considered. In November
and December 1890, however, the vertical force magnetograph was out
of action, which reduces by ten the number of days available in the case
of the vertical force and inclination.

      In the following table, I., the six Januarys, six Februarys, &,c., of the
six years have been combined together, so as to show the values of the
cyclic effects at different seasons of the year. The figures under the

heading ' Individual Months ' show in how many of the six Januarys, &c.,

the effect was an increase of the element in question, was nil, or a decrease.

At the foot of the table appear the mean non-cyclic effects per ' quiet

day throughout the six years, and the totals of the several columns under
the headings ' Individual Months.'

     Mean Annual Values from ' Quiet ' and Unrestricted Days.

     § 4. Table IV. is merely a plain statement of facts ; but if too exclu-
sively considered it might unquestionably convey an exaggerated idea of

the defects attaching to the ordinary use made of 'quiet ' days at the pre-

sent time. At Kew Observatory they are employed to get out the mean

diurnal inequality for summer and winter and the whole year, as well as

the mean annual values of the several elements.

     As regai-ds the mean annual value of an element, the quantity

' mean value from " quiet" days less mean value from all days ' may be

irregularly positive and negative, or like the non-cyclic effect in the

element it may be normally of one sign. It would certainly be desirable

to know which of the alternatives is true. The meaning to be attached

to the secular variation deduced from two consecutive years or from a

short series of years would be much more uncertain if the former

alternative represented the facts than if the latter did.

     In the Greenwich ' Magnetical and Meteorological Observations ' tables

are published showing the diurnal variations both in ' quiet ' and unre-

stricted days, but not apparently direct information as to the difference

between the absolute values of means deduced from the ' quiet ' and from

unrestricted days.

     At St. Petersburg, and then at Pawlowsk, it has, however, long been

customary for Dr. Wild to select a series of normal ' quiet ' days whose

results are dealt with alongside of those from unrestricted days. The

principle of selection guiding the choice at Pawlowsk and Greenwich has

probably been slightly different, but there is at least a strong presumption

that the differences between the annual means from unrestricted days and

from the Astronomer Royal's ' quiet ' days will prove to be of the same

character as the corresponding differences observed in the case of Wild's

'quiet' days.

     § 5. The annual means for all the elements at St. Petersburg, from

both ' quiet ' and unrestricted days, for some twelve to sixteen years

preceding 1885 are given in a paper by Dr. Mtiller in the 'Repertorium

fiir Meteorologie,' Bd. XII. No. 8. In the case of every element, according

to Miiller's tables 20 to 2.3, the sign of the quantity ' " quiet " day mean

less unrestricted day mean ' was uniformly, or practically uniformly, of

one  sign                             and  the  secular variations deduced from the        ' quiet ' and  un-
                                   ;

restricted day results, even for consecutive years, showed a remarkably

good agreement. The following summary of the mean results deducible

from Miiller's tables is extracted from a recent paper by Leyst · :

236 REPORT-- 1896.

     § 8. Table V. shows how much more important relatively the non-
cyclic effect is in the winter than in the summer half-year.

     In the winter half-year we see that the non-cyclic effect in both
horizontal force and inclination is equal to about one-fifth of the range.
This does not of course imply that there is an uncertainty of 20 per cent,

in the range, because, whatever be the nature of the correction applied to
eliminate the non-cyclic effect, it is hardly likely to introduce more than
a small fraction of the observed difference between and twenty-four

hours into the algebraic difference of the maximum and minimum read-

ings. The interval of time between these readings is in most cases nearer
six hours than twelve. The fact, however, remains that in some indi-
vidual winters the uncertainty as to the range must be very appreciable.

When we come to individual winter months, notably January, when the

observed range is least, the uncertainty is apt to be considerable.

     The preceding remarks refer exclusively to the uncertainties which

the existence of the non-cyclic effect introduces into diurnal ranges
deduced from ' quiet ' days. Previous reports of the Committee ' have

dealt with differences between the ranges deduced from unrestricted and
from ' quiet ' days. It seems to me, however, that such comparisons are
open to criticism so long as the proper treatment of the non-cyclic effect
remains uncertain.

                Relation of Non-cyclic Effects to Diurnal Inequalities.

      § 9. In the yearly and half-yearly results the most critical point is the
nature of the diurnal inequality in the late night and early morning-
hours. The observed variation is then small, especially in winter, so that
a disturbing element of no great absolute magnitude might completely
alter the character of the phenomena. This will appear at once on I'efer-
ence to the curves of declination and horizontal force in last year's
report, pp. 212 and 220. The curves on p. 220 are certainly suggestive of
the presence of some abnormal influence during the midnight hours ; at
the same time this is not more true of them than of curves lOf the same
type for Greenwich which Sir G. B. Airy - based on data derived from all
days but those of considerable disturbance.

I

' Elimination of Non-cyclic Effect.

      § 10. If diurnal inequalities are to be got out at all from ' quiet days ' in

a form suitable for harmonic analysis, they must be made cyclic, and there
is certainly no simpler way of doing this than that adopted last year, viz.,

 treating the observed data as if the non- cyclic effect proceeded uniformly
throughout the twenty-four hours. This method of treatment does not
 prejudice the facts. Supposing the non-cyclic effect to proceed irregularly

throughout the twenty-foui' hours, then it may most conveniently be ana-

 lysed into terms, one being a linear function of the time, the others periodic
 functions whose periods are twenty-four houi's or submultiples thereof.

 The linear term is eliminated by the method adopted last year. The
 cyclic terms of course remain, and are incorporated with the other cyclic
terms of like period which go to make up the diurnal inequality on ' quiet

days. It would, however, be impossible to separate the two sets of cyclic
terms by any mathematical device, without au addition of physical facts
or a supply of theories in their place. One way of obtaining additional
facts would be to compare for a series of years the constant coefficients in
the hai'monic analysis of the diurnal inequalities from ' quiet ' and un-
restricted days. The accidental features introduced by the arbitrary
nature of the choice of ' quiet ' days might, however, prove troublesome.

     The term in the non-cyclic effect treated as a linear function of the
time may in its turn be composed of a series of terms, some possibly fluc-

tuating regularly with the season of the year, others possibly of very long

period ; its magnitude, at least in individual months, may depend in large

measure on the accidental preference of one set of ' quiet ' days to another.

                                                               Associated Phenomena.

§ 11. It was pointed out last year {I.e., p. 213) that the elimination of

the non-cyclic effect through a correction consisting of a linear function

of the time was determined solely by considerations of convenience and

mathematical simplicity. It was carefully explained (I.e., §§ .5, 6) that
General Sabine and Dr. Lloyd had observed phenomena in magnetic

storms so exactly the converse of those presented by the non-cyclic ejBfect

on ' quiet ' days as to suggest that the two classes of phenomena were inter-

dependent                                            and  the  conclusion  was  drawn that  if  this interdependence
                                                  ;

were true the non-cyclic effect might be expected in reality to progress

irregularly throughout the twenty-four hours.

These conclusions may now, perhaps, be regarded as more than sur-

mises. In the 'Met. Zeitschrift ' for September 1895 Dr. van Bemmelen

has described phenomena he terms Nachstorung, which appear to be of the

same general character as, if not identical with, what has been termed

here the non-cyclic effect.

As the title he selected implies, Dr. van Bemmelen associates the

phenomena very intimately with magnetic storms. His investigations

have included data from a variety of stations ; and whilst his theoretical

conclusions may, perhaps, undergo modification in the future, his work

certainly indicates that an increase of knowledge as to this outstanding

phenomenon on ' quiet ' days is likely to be of service in the general theory

of terrestrial magnetism.

     § 12. In the meantime it might be safest not to assume that the non-
cyclic element is an effect, and a preceding magnetic storm a cause. The

fact that the horizontal force, for instance, tends to rise abnormally fast

during a ' quiet ' day may, of course, merely represent a recovery from an

abnormal loss occasioned by a magnetic storm ; but it is at least con-

ceivable that the abnormal fall during a magnetic storm may be partly a

consequence of abnormal increase jDreceding it, or the two phenomena
may be effects of a common cause.

If ' quiet ' days, with no appreciable disturbance, were the rule, one

might possibly determine with ease the relationships of any given 'quiet'

(lay to a preceding or succeeding disturbed day ; but appreciable move-

ments will usually be found both before and after a ' quiet ' daj^ at no great

interval of time. If the causes operating in large and small disturbances

are the same, then it is not improbable a priori that a small disturbance

within a day or two of a ' quiet ' day may have more to do with it than a

large disturbance a week befoi-e or after. It should also be remembered
       --

238 REPORT-- 1896.

·that General Sabine found that whilst, as a rule, large disturbances lowered
the horizontal and raised the vertical force, the opposite results ensued in

a very considerable number of instances.
     In proposing any additions to the existing ' quiet ' day system, or any

substitute, it must be remembered that one of the main objects aimed at
by its introduction was a substantial saving in the labour required to
obtain comparable results from different observatories. The tabulation of
the whole mass of curves was felt in most cases too serious a burden.
Considerable light might be thrown on the question of the uniformity or
variableness of the non-cyclic element throughout the day by a very
simple addition, viz., curve measurements at the noons preceding and suc-
ceeding each ' quiet' day. In the course of this paper other suggestions
have been made, but they could be put into effect only at observatories
prepared to tabulate all the curves.

     In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the assistance I have derived

from discussing a variety of the points involved with Mr. T. W. Baker,
Chief Assistant at the Kew Observatory.

                                         APPENDIX.
                             Remarks hy W. Ellis, Esq., F.R.S.

Having had the opportunity of reading Dr. Chree's report on non-

cyclic magnetic effects, I would beg to be allowed to offer the following

remai-ks :

     I had read with great interest Dr. Chree's ' Comparison and Reduc-

tion of Magnetic Observations,' forming the report of the Magnetic Com-

mittee for the year 1895, in which he discusses the Kew magnetic results

on 'quiet' days for the years 1890 to 1894. I had lately commenced to
work up in a similar way the corresponding Greenwich results in order
to make comparisons between Greenwich and Kew, when treated for the

same years in a similar manner. Interesting questions are involved,
since it cannot be said to be at present known how far the magnetic

changes at two places not remotely distant one from the other should be

expected to be similar, and if not similar to what extent there may be

difference, and also whether any part of such difference might be instru-

mental. It is not satisfactory to compare results for one period with

results for another place for a different period, because at any one place

the phenomena may vary considerably at different times. But my work

is not sufficiently advanced to enable me to put the results at present into
shape ; still I may perhaps give some information bearing on points now
discussed by Dr. Chree. In Table I. he gives the mean non-cyclic effect
for 'quiet' days for different magnetic elements for each month of the year,

Mydeduced from the Kew observations of the six years 1890 to 1895.
numbers for Greenwich are for the five years 1890 to 1894. At Kew the

non-cyclic change in declination is positive in the first five, and in the

ninth, tenth, and eleventh months of the year, and negative in the

remaining months. At Greenwich it is positive in the first five months

and in the eleventh month, and negative in the other months. At both
Kew =places the largest positive value is in January,
                                                                            4- 0'"63, Green-

are (effect xlO*" in C.G.S. units), in January, February, October, and

Greenwich, the values being +62, +5.3, +7.3, and +57 respectively.

the non-cyclic effect in different months at the two places. The mean for

8, and at Greenwich           18. In this comparison it

is to be remembered that the Kew results depend on the observations of

six years, and the Greenwich results only on those of five years.

    As regards now the mean values in separate years (Table III.) ; of

the five years 1890 to 1894 the non-cyclic change in declination is in the

same direction in four of the five years at both places ; in horizontal force
in the same direction in all years, and in vertical force in three years.

The actual numbers are :

whole earth at precisely the same moment of absolute time (see ' Proc.

Roy. Soc' vol. lii. p. 191).  But an instantaneous magnetic shock

sensible over the whole globe could scarcely, one would imagine, arise

from action from within alone ; and since magnetic disturbances are more
frequent when sunspots are numerically high, there seems reason to

suppose that the exciting cause is in such cases mainly external. To

pursue this matter is, however, rather to enter the region of speculation.

It may perhaps be remarked that the mean non-cyclic change for
+ --.horizontal force and vertical force on 'quiet' days is 40 and
                                                                        18

+ --all days is correspondingly
                              34 and       8 respectively. Thus the rela-

tion in both elements is of the same character.

   A part of my work consisted of a comparison of diurnal inequalities

of the magnetic elements on ' quiet ' days with those found by including all

<lays (always excepting the excessive magnetic disturbances), and also of

.a comparison of diurnal range as given :  (1)  by 'quiet' days as observed
                                                                                                                                              ;

(2) by 'quiet' days corrected for non-cyclic change ; and (3) by including

all days, in all cases for the different months of the year ; but tlie work

is not sufficiently advanced to enable any particulars to be given.

Dr. Chree, referring to a previous report of the Magnetic Committee

and to a paper by Messrs. Robson and Smith in the ' Phil. Mag.' for

August 1890, speaks of the differences between diurnal ranges deduced

from unrestricted days, that is all days, and from ' quiet ' days. I may

perhaps point out that these comparisons were between ' quiet ' days at Kew

and all days at Greenwich, and were for the element of declination only.

Jn such a comparison the question of difference of locality must be taken

into account, and also possibly to some extent the difference of instruments.

Rut in a paper which I communicated to the ' Phil. Mag.' for January 1891

I made a more direct comparison of results, for the one year 1889, compar-

ing the diurnal inequalities for 'quiet' days (five in each month) at

Greenwich with those for all days at the same place. This comparison

was made for all the three elements of declination, horizontal force, and

vertical force. The five-day results were not corrected for non-cyclic

change, but in declination and vertical force this was evidently small.

The results show a marked difference between the diurnal inequalities for

"^juiet ' days and for all days. The later work in this dii'ection, yet incom-

plete, to which I have above referred, includes a discussion of the diurnal

inequalities for the five years 1890 to 1894 for 'quiet' days and for all

days, and the results seem likely to support those found for the single

year 1889.

not be advantageous to substitute for the internal thermometer a thermo-

electric arrangement whereby the solar radiation should be measured by

Athe deflection of a galvanometer.                                      thin disk of blackened copper was

lixed in the position previously occupied by the flattened bulb of the

internal thermometer, and two wires led from this disk, namely, a

platinoid wire from behind the middle point of the disk and a copper

wire from the edge, the second junction of the two metals being embedded!

in the solid copper of the case, the temperature of which was given by the

Acase-thermometers.        d'Arsonval galvanometer was intercalated in the

thermo-electric circuit, and the difterence of temperatures of the twO'

junctions was given by the deflection of tlie mirror, which was read by

eye by means of a divided scale. This arrangement Avas found to work

in  a  very  satisfactory  manner                                  the  obser\'ations  could  be  taken  in  a
                                                                ;

shorter time than with the thermometer ; and on reducing the results by

the formula given in a former report it was found that the numbers

obtained for a magnitude theoretically proportional to the radiation came

out very consistent with one another when they were deduced from

different trios of readings taken on the same occasion. Professor McLeod

had not, however, sufficient leisure to continue the experiments as he

wished, and INIr. W. E. Wilson took charge of the instrument with a view

to continue the experiments.

    Mr. Wilson modifled the apparatus by introducing an arrangement by

wliich the light reflected by the mirror of the galvanometer, instead of

serving for eye c-bservations, was received on a photographic plate which

descended by clockwork, and recorded the deviations of the mirror at

times which were recorded by a fixed light falling on the plate, which was

interrupted at each second, so that the former light traced out a curve,

the ordinates of which corresponded to the deflections, while tlie abscissae

gave the time.

    In this manner very neat curves were obtained, which gave a perma-

nent recoj'd of the observations. This record was of course exempt from

possible errors of reading, and could be dealt with at leisure. In a later

arrangement tlie interruptions at each second Avere i-ecorded on the curve

itself as well as on the line of abscissa;, a method which presents certain

advantages for the subsequent reduction.

    In order to obtain a base line corresponding to an equality of tempera-

ture of the disk and the case, the plate v,as started, and the permanently

fixed light and that reflected from the mirror not yet deflected were

allowed to record themselves a few seconds before the sun's rays were

allowed to fall on the plate. The latter gave a short straight line, parallel

to the axis of abscissae, corresponding to no deviation, from which the

curve started when the light of the sun was let on.

    The curves obtained in the preliminary trials Avere sent to Sir George

8tokes for reduction. Tlie rapidity of the change from the straight line

traced before incidence of the sun's rays to a curve which showed no sign

of the discontinuity of the initial conditions showed that the effect of the

inertia of the galvanometer was practically insensible, provided at least a

very few seconds were allowed for the instrument to get into train, that

is, provided a minute portion of the curve, iiear the point cf sudden

change in the conditions, were excluded in the reduction.

       The galvanometer was dead-beat, but it is conceivable that the

damping force might have been such as to cause a sensible difference

between the angular position of the mirror of the galvanometer and that
                                                                                                       ON SOLAR RADIATION.  243

corresponding to equilibrium between the torsional force at the moment

and the deflecting force belonging to the thermo-electric current at the
Abame moment.
                special experiment showed, however, that such was not

the case, and that the difference between tho actual position and that

corresponding to equilibrium was practically insensible, provided a very

few seconds were allowed to elapse after any sudden change of the nature

of letting on or cutting off the sun's light.

It follows from this that the simple differential equation mentioned in

the report of the Committee for 1892 may be used in this case as well as
when the solar rays actuated an internal thermometer. The integral of

the differential equation shows that the curve is a logarithmic curve, the

parameter of which, or index of the exponential, is constant, provided the

constant relating to cooling, the q of that report, is the same under all

circumstances.

     Measurement of tlie cur\es obtained showed that they agreed extremely

well with logarithmic curves. Any two logarithmic curves, of which the

parameter is the same, may be superposed by moving one relatively to the

other without disturbing the parallelism of their axes, but not if the

pai-ameters are different. In general the curves obtained seemed to be

sensibly superposable, indicating that q was not merely constant during
an exposure made under gi^-en circumstances, but even when the circum-

stances were different                                                                                 as, for example, when one diaphragm was replaced
                                                                                                    ;

by another of twice the area. In one case, however, it seemed that the

coefficient was slightly but sensibly smaller. The constancy or otherwise

of (7 is a point still under examination. Should it prove to be sensibly

different when the circumstances are changed, the expression may still be

obtained from three observations, that is, from three points of the curve.

If, for the sake of simplifying the formula, the intervals of time are

chosen equal, the expression {\iif l{- l^HC) has merely to be multiplied
by q, the expression for which need not at present be written down, in

order to obtain a measure of the radiation. It may be well to remark

that this measure is merely relative ; the question of obtaining the radia-
tion in absolute measure is one into which the Committee have not as yet

entered.

     Professor Herbert JMcLeod, Professor W. C. Roberts-Austen,

     Mr. H. G. Madan, and Mr. D. H. Nagel.

The work of collecting and arranging the titles of papers on subjects

related to spectroscopy has been continued up to the present date.
     In the Report presented by the Committee last year it was proposed

to discontinue the work at the end of 1895, and it was suggested that the
four sections of the list of titles should be printed as a separate publica-
tion. In view, however, of the meeting of the International Committee

to consider the preparation of a catalogue of scientific literature, the

Committee now proposes to continue the work up to the year 1900. so as
to complete the list up to the time when the International Bureau will
commence its labours.

     The Committee, therefore, asks for reappointment.

The bibliography of the subject having been completed for the last Report,
the Committee have been able to give their full time to experimental work

during the past year. In addition to the appended results on the arrange-
ments adopted for the work, the determination of bismuth, antimony and
tin, and the separation of the Uvo latter, the work on the determination of
cobalt, nickel and zinc is well advanced, and will be included, together with
further work on bismutli, in the next Report of the Committee.

     The examination of methods for the electrolytic estimation of this
metal was conducted in the chemical laboratory of Trinity College, Dublin.

     The electrolytic department of the laboratory is iitted in the usual
way. The currents lequired are derived from the ' Bristol ' type of storage
cells, made up in sets of si.x in each case, with connections .so arranged

that currents of 'l amperes and 4, 8, or 12 volts can be obtained as required.
These cells, whicli are compact and light, have given very satisfactory
results during two years' frequent use, and are now in perfectly good order.

ON KLKCTUOLYTIC METHODS OF QUAXTITATIVK ANALYSIS. 245

The measurements of currents for most purposes is effected by the

\3sual gravity ammeters indicating 0'5 to 2 amperes, but much smaller

currents  than  O'O  ampere  must  be  used  in  bismuth     estimations                                               the

astatic galvanometer, with silk fibre suspension, and carefully calibrated

Ain the position in which it was used.  curve was plotted for converting

deflections into amperes, so that O'Ol ampere could be read directly, and

O'OOl ampere current measured by interpolation. Pro\isiou was also

made for slmnting in a gravity voltmeter.

For bismuth estimation a box of coils giving high resistances was used

for regulating the current, as the platinoid spiral with slide, in genera'

use in the laboratoiy, did not offer more than 30 ohms resistance.

   A long series of preliminaiy experiments made with bismuth nitrate

solutions and different forms of electrodes indicated :

     1. That the conical form of negative electrode is not suitable for use
ill the estimations of bismuth, as it is difficult to get good adherent deposits
on the cones, unless the solutions are very dilute.

     2. That the large, smooth surface of a carefully spun platinum dish is
liest suited fur the negative pole in bismuth estimations. The dishes used
in the test estimations weighed from 3-5 to 38 grammes, and the internal

areas averaged 190 square centimetres.
     3. That a large flat spiral of platinum wire for the positive electrode is

more satisfactory than a disc, as it allows free circulation in the liquid.

   A large number of experiments were made in the first instance with a

view to ascertain the kind of solution most convenient for electrolysis,
the nitrate or sulphate being used as the staiting point in the production
of the different liquids actually electrolysed. Irregular results were

obtained with the simple nitrate containing varying proportions of free

nitric acid ; but good determinations were more easily made in solutions
of the sulphate when electrolysed by currents of 0'08 to 0'2 ampere.

    On the other hand, for the purposes of actual analysis, it seemed of
more practical importance to ascertain how far the more convenient

nitrate solution could be made to afford good reguline deposits of bismuth,
which should admit of washing without loss or material oxidation. It
was found that careful adjustment of the current is one of the elements
of success, but not the only one, and that 0-03 ampere is the maximum
current that should be used nearly to the end of the operation, though
O'l may be passed to complete deposition. Regulation of the current did

not alone prove suflicient to neutralise the effect of excess of niti-ic acid,

and most of the substances were tried which have been recommended for
use in similar electrolyses. Of these, metaphosphoric acid and citric acid
proved so much better than any others Ave employed that our attention
was directed chiefly to examine their eftects in test experiments with
bismuth nitrate.

                                          Test Experiments.

     The bismuth used in the preparation of the test solutions was carefully
purified. In the first instance it was repeatedly fused with small quan-
tities of nitre and cast. This metal was then heated to low redness for
fifteen minutes with potassium cyanide and sulphur, with constant
stirring ; was again cast, and reheated to bright redness with 5 per cent,
of a mixture of pure sodium and potassium carbonate. The fine metal so
obtained was dissolved in nitric acid, the solution evaporated to a small
bulk, and then precipitated as oxynitrate by water. The washed pro-

duct -svas again dissoh'ecl in nitric acid, and \vas fractionally precipitated
by ammonia, the first and last fractions Ijcing rejected. The middle
fraction, after thorough washing, -was preserved and used in the prepara-

tion of the final test solutions of bismuth.

     The first solution of bismuth nitrate prepared contained, in 25 c.c,

0-125 grme. of bismuth. This contained a sufficient excess of nitric acid
to prevent precipitation unless diluted with about ten volumes of water.

     In the following series of estimations 25 c.c. of the solution were used
in each case, and either diluted to 150 c.c. in a platinum dish with water

only, or made up to the total volume of 150 c.c. with water after addition
of the various substances stated below. The electrolysis was then com-
menced with the current specified, and the action usually allowed to
continue all night. At the end the current was generally increased, in

order to complete the deposition.

    As slight oxidation takes place at the edge of the liquid even with
apparently very good reguline deposits, the latter, when washed, dried,

and weighed, were in some cases oxidised by nitric acid, the solution
carefully evaporated to dryness, and heated until the bismuth nitrate was
converted wholly into BioO-,. Fi'om the oxide obtained the weight of Bi
was then calculated. This operation is easilj' executed in the electrolytic
dish, and was found to be a useful check, especially when the results of

electrolysis seemed too good.

      Operating in this ^vay, the results on the preceding page, from 1 to 11,
were ol>tained with 25 c.c. of liismuth nitrate solution=0'125 grnie. of Bi
diluted to 150 c.c.

     Experiments 12 and 13 were made with solutions of different strengths
and larger proportions of nitric acid than those which precede.

      So far as experiments with the simple nitrate solutions were concerned
the results merely confirmed all our previous experience, as it is very
ditticult to obtain a good adherent dep>osit on electrolysis except from very

·dilute solutions.

      Tlie results obtained witli metaphosphoric acid under the conditions
specified indicate that the reagent controls deposition in a very marked
way, and enables us to get good adherent reguline deposits even in

presence of much free nitric acid and when using a comparatively strong
current. The use of metaphosplioric acid is therefore attended %vith

considerable advantage in the case of simple bismuth nitrate solutions.
     Citric acid has proved quite as effective as metaphosphoric acid, and

»ives a wider range of utility in general analysis. Moreover bismuth can
be separated from alkaline citrate solution in good condition and with
considerable accuracy ; hence we are disposed to prefer the use of citric
acid to that of metaphosphoric acid in electrolytic determinations of
bismuth.

     The separation of bismuth from stronger solutions and from other dis-

solved metals will be considered in the next report.

      The Ajjparatus employed and the Arrangament of tlie Circidts for
         Electrolytic Analysis. By Charles A. KoiiN, Ph.D., B.Sc.

     The arrangements for electrolytic work described in this portion of the
Report ha%'e been fitted up in the Chemical Laboratory of University
College, Liverpool, where the work on the determination iif antimony and
tin and their separation has been carried out.

   A set of five secondary cells charged by a dynamo were employed

tlu-oughout the analyses.

                               Electrodes.

Platinum dishes of about 200 c.c. capacity, and weighing 37-38

grme., were used as the cathode, and small platinum discs with holes

bored through them to admit of the escape of the evolved gases as the

anode. For the determination of both antimony and tin, sand-blasted

phitinum  dishes  were  found  preferable  to  the  ordinary polished dishes
                                                                                                                                              ;

this is especially the case when the deposition of a metal is effected

from a hot solution. The electrodes were kept 20 mm. apart. Glass

stands with brass supports as described by Classen were used to hold the

electrodes, the support for the dishes being covered with an asbestos card

when lieating was necessary.

   A suitable ampere-meter for electrolytic analysis has long been a de-

sideratum. The use of the water voltameter which was formerly employed
has for obvious reasons been abandoned, and the ampere-meters on the
market are almost all cither too restricted in their range or lacking in
sensibility ; in addition their internal resistance is so high that it must
always be allowed for whenever the instrument is not in circuit. The

                                             is composed almost entirely of
                                             iron and steel, with an air-gap
                                             of 2 mm. in thickness. The
                                             steel is carefully magnetised and
                                             ' aged,' and the circuit is so de-
                                             signed that the demagnetising
                                             force is negligible. The chief

                                             part of the electric circuit is the

                                             moving coil, which conveys the

                                             current, or a portion of the
                                             current to be measured.

                                                  In the voltmeter the coil is
                                             placed in series with a resistance
                                             of manganin ; in the ampere-
                                             meter it is placed in parallel with
                                             a small resistance. The whole
                                             length of the scale is about 220"*
                                             of arc. Currents of all mag-

                                             nitudes may be measured from

The ampere-ineter actually employed had a range of from 0-3-5

amperes, the graduations corresponding to 0-02 of an ampere. The
internal resistance was 0-03 ohm, and the readings above O'l ampere
perfectly accurate and constant. For currents below 0-1 ampere an
instrument with the range to 0-1 ampere must be substituted, but such

small currents are not required for the experiments described in this

portion of the report. Small rheostats with mercury connections were used
as resistances, one for each circuit, each having a series of resistance coils
from ^ up to 40 ohms, and a total resistance of 80^ ohms.

     The current density is in all cases calculated on 100 sq. cm. of cathode
surface, and expressed as C.D.,og.

                                    Arrangement of the Circuits.

     The accompanying plans show the ai-rangement adopted for six circuits.

   AThe tables Band are each divided into three parts by thin strips

of wood, the current being carried in each case by wires from the brass
terminals ' 6 ' to the stand for the electrodes, which is placed between
them. The circuit is completed or broken by an ordinary electric light

switch, ' S.'

     The centre-table contains all the connections to the ampere-meter,
voltmeter, and resistances, in addition to the instruments themselves, thus

leaving the tables on which the analyses are carried out perfectly free
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

this is a decided convenience. This centre- table is provided with a flap-

cover, so that the instruments are protected, except when measurements

are being taken.

     The details of the connections on the centre-table for three of the

Dcircuits are shown on Fig. 2. The board D, which is fixed on to the

centre-table, carries two small boards A' and B', fitted with mercury-

mcup connections ' ' ; it also carries three small blocks, C, on each of

which are fixed three brass binding-screws, connected underneath by a
broad copper strip. R,, E,,, and R3 are the resistance boxes.

     The negative wire from the secondary cells passes direct to the con-

necting board C,, fixed on the wall at the back of the tables, the remaining
wires from the batteries passing to the switch-board (Fig. 2), so that any

number of cells from one up to six can be put into use. From the ter-

minal of the switch-board a wire passes to the connecting board Co, and
thence to the table A, where it is divided in parallel into the three circuits
1, 2 and 3 by a small connecting board which, together with the necessary

Awiring, runs under the ledge of the table (Fig. 1). The circuit is com-

pleted from the connecting board Cj through the mercury cup 'm ' on the
board A' (Fig. 2), marked ' to circuits.' This cup is connected to the

other cups 1, 2 and 3 on the same board by spanners of stout copper wire
with ebonite handles. The resistance of the spanner is negligible, as is
that of the ampere-meter, but in cases where that of the latter has to be
considered, a spanner must be used, having an equivalent resistance.
Similar spanners are used for the ampere-meter and voltmeter connections

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

they are all of different lengths so as to prevent mistakes in taking

rent passes througli the resistance box E], tlien to the block C4, and finally

Ato tlie table  to complete the circuit. By placing the spanner between

7)11 ^iid the cup on the board A' leading to the ampere-meter, m', the current

is similarly completed through the ampere-meter, so that the reading is

taken without stopping the current. The connections to the voltmeter will

be clear from the diagram ; it is simply a branch from each of the circuits.

     After adding the sodium sulphide to tlic antimony chloride the solu-
tion was filtered into a platinum dish, diluted to 175 c.c. with water and
electrolysed. The fleposited metal was washed successively with alcohol
and ether and dried in the air bath at 80° C. before weighing.

                                                               Serie.s I.

                                                       Antimony.

    The object of this series of experiments was to ascertain how varia-

tions in the quantity of sodium sulphide present, in excess, in the solution
of the sulpho-salt, afiected the deposition of the antimony, and what
degree of accuracy was obtainable with varying quantities of metal under
the most favourable conditions.

     The electrolyses were in all cases conducted in the cold solution and
allowed to go over night ; an excess of sodium sulphide above that
required to form the sodium sulpho-antimonite was always present. The

--results are recorded in the following table :

     The separation of sulpliur at tlie cathode must be due to a secondary

decomposition, -svhich is prevented provided there is a certain excess of
the sulphide present. It appears immaterial whetlier this excess is

increased or not, for in IS'os. 9, 10, and 11 three times as much sulphide
was added as in Nos. 12, 10, and 1-1 for the same quantities of antimony.
From this the method is reliable, provided 30 c.c. of sodium sulphide of
sp. gr. 1"18 are added for e\ ery 02 grme. of antimony, and up to 50 c.c.
can be used with safety. Classen and others recommend this proportion

the above experiments point out the necessity for it.
     The current density of 0'15 to 0*20 ampere per 100 sq. cm. should not

be exceeded, otherwise the metal does not adhere so well to the electrode.
The completion of the deposition is best tested by withdrawing a little of
the solution from tlie dish with a capillary tube, and testing it with acid
for the presence of antimony sulphide.

     The addition of ccmxtlc soda to the sodium sulphide has no disadvan-
tageous effect on the method as described. Under similar conditions to
the above, in whicli 30 c.c. of sulphide solution and 2 grme. of sodium
hydrate were added, O'lol-l grme. antimony were found for 0-1515 taken.
Caustic soda is added in the separation of antimony and tin electrolyti-
cally, hence it was desirable to ascertain its influence, if any.

     The solutions of the sulpho-salt were quite free from polysulphides, but
should these be present they must be oxidised with hydrogen peroxide.

     The time required for the deposition of antimony is considerably
shortened by conducting the electrolysis in the warm solution. The
antimony solution is treated with sodium sulphide as described, and
electrolysed with a current of 1 ampere ; 0'2 grme. of metal can be readily
deposited in 2h hours. Under the right conditions the deposit is bright
and metallic in appearance. The following table records the results

is reliable, as shown in Xos. 2 to 6, though rather less so for small quan-
tities of metal than when the electrolysis is conducted in the cold solution.
The temperature should not exceed 50° to 60°. The deposit is bright
and metallic in appearance, and adheres well to the dish.

              Deposition of Antimony from Ammonium Tartrate Solution,

     Parodi and Mascazzini {loc. cit.) state that antimony can be deposited

from a solution of its chloride in ammonium tartrate, but give no experi-

mental data. According to Classen an adherent deposit is obtained from
a potassium tartrate solution, but tlie separation takes too long to be of

value for analysis. As very few results have been published on this

method a series of experiments were tried. These show that the complete
deposition of antimony from a solution of an alkali tartrate is possible, in
about nineteen houi's, with a current density per 100 sq. cm. of 0'15 am-
pere. The deposit, however, does not possess the bright metallic appear-
ance of that obtained from sodium sulphide solution ; it is dark and dull
and does not adhere very fast to the dish. Still it can usually be washed
without loss, although with quantities of metal, above O'l grme., this
was not possible, hence the low result in No. 1. Also when the current
is allowed to exceed 0-15 ampere per 100 sq. cm. the deposit is less
adherent and apt to Avash off. Nos. 2, 9, and 10 illustrate this. The method
of analysis was to neutralise the solution of antimony chloride and add

the ammonium tartrate in a 12 per cent, solution, the electrolysis being
conducted in the cold solution and over night. The following results Avere

obtained :

Although accurate results can be obtained by electrolysing an ammonium
tartrate solution of an antimony salt the method requires much greater

attention and the conditions are more limited than the above ; it is, there-
fore, not to be recommended from a practical standpoint, whereas the
deposition from a solution of the sulpho-salt possesses advantages over the
ordinary gravimetric inethods for the determination of antimony both in
regard to ra^^idity and accuracy.

this, were it not that the deposit then obtained is always more or less
powdery in form, and does not adhere sufficiently well to the dish to admit
of beint; washed without loss. The method can be made to yield fair
results if the solution be kept just acid throughout the electrolysis by the

·addition of oxalic or acetic acid from time to time, as required (Series II.)
but such a procedure requires constant attention, thus withdrawing at

once one of the most marked advantages of electrolytic analysis.
     The tin solution used in the following experiments was prepared by dis-

solving pure tin in pure hydrochloric acid, the acid solution being neutra-

lised with ammonium hydrate before use and diluted to 175 c.c. The

     Preliminary Expeeimexts, in which 120 c.c. of the ammonium oxalate

solution were added for 0-1 grme. of tin, showed that the solution be-
comes alkaline and separates stannic acid after 6 hours, during which
time only GO-70 per cent, of the metal is precipitated. The decomposition

may be represented by the equation :

(Nos. n, 9, 1 and 1 3), it is quite evident that the method is unreliable. With

a current density of 0-3 to 0-5 ampere, either throughout the experiment,
or increased up to 1"0 ampere to-wards the completion of the electrolysis,
as in Nos. 9, 10, the deposition is incomplete, and no advantage is

gained by tvanniTif/ the sohUion to 60°-70° C. as in Nos. 11 and 12. The

Adish, and the results are altogether more reliable.  current of OS

ampere is best, and 18-19 hours must l^e allowed for the complete deposi-

tion even of such small quantities as taken in Nos. 10, 11, 12, for the last

traces are only very slowly separated from solution. If a stronger current

(1-0 ampere) be employed the deposit does not udliere properly. The only

way to tell whether the deposition is complete is to expose a fresh portion

of the surface of the catliode to the solution, by diluting the contents of

the dish, and to observe whether any more metal is separated after con-

tinuing the passage of the current for one hour ; none of the ordinary

tests for tin are sufficiently delicate to indicate the completion of the

Aelectrolysis.  comparison of Nos. 13, 14, lo, in which the amount of

acetic acid added was varied, show that from 1-5-25 c.c. of a 50 per cent,

solution of acetic acid is most favourable. The larger quantity was found

the more reliable.

This method may be regarded as giving accurate results under the

conditions mentioned ; but it is extremely important to keep the current
steady, and not to exceed 0'3 to O^-i ampere per 100 sq. cm. of cathode

surface, otherwise it is impossible to be certain of a firm deposit.

     Engel (loc. cit.) has recently shown that tlie electrolytic determination

hydroxylamine sulphate alone, or of the sulphate or hydrochloride in addi-

tion to ammonium acetate and tartaric acid. The presence of such a

reducing agent as hydroxylamine prevents the separation of stannic acid

the deposition of tin from ammonium oxalate solution reliable, and the

     Classen Las taken advantage of the fact that tin is not deposited from
a concentrated solution of the sodium sulpho-salt upon electrolysis in
order to separate it from antimony. The mixed sulphides are dissolved
in sodium sulphide, 1-2 grme. of sodium hydrate added, and the

solution electrolysed, either cold with a current of 0-2 ampei'e, or warm
·with a current of about 1 '0 ampere. Any polysulphides present must be
oxidised with hydrogen peroxide. The deposited antimony is washed and

dried as usual. The residual solution contains the tin, which is detei'-
]nined either by boiling with ammonium sulphate and electrolysing the

solution of the ammonium sulpho-salt thus formed, or by converting the
sulpliide of tin into stannic oxide, and this into the double ammonium

oxalate for electrolysis.

A few experiments were first tried to ascertain under what conditions

tin is not deposited from its sodium sulpho-salt. The tin was first precipi-

tated as sulphide, the precii^itate thoroughly washed, and then dissolved

in sodium sulphide solution of sp. gr. 1-18. The solution was diluted to

Whenever tlie sodium sulpho-salt solution was coloured yellow by the
presence of polysulphides these were oxidised by gentle '.varrning with a

little hydrogen peroxide.

   A considerable number of experiments were made, using varying pro-

portions of antimony and tin, from which the following typical results

are less favourable, and with a ratio of tin to antimony £,bove 2 : 1 quite
unreliable (Nos. 18 and 19). In presence of an excess of antimony the
method is satisfactory (Nos. 9-15). Classen's published results on his
method of separation do not give instances of larger proportions of tin
to antimony than 2 to 1 . The metliod requires care and special attention
to the strength of current employed, the purity of the sodium sulphide
used, and the thorough washing of the precipitated sulphides.

      Note on the Sejmration of Arsenic from Antimony and Tin dectrolyticaUy.

     It has been shown by Classen that antimony is deposited free
from arsenic from a solution of their sodium sulpho-salts, provided the
latter is first completely oxidised to arsenic acid ; but in the presence of
tin the arsenic must be removed from the solution before the electrolytic
determination of the tin can be proceeded with, after the antimony has
been deposited. Electrolysis, therefore, offers no advantage whatever
under these conditions, and no experiments were carried out with
mixtures of the three metals. The most rational method of procedure
in presence of arsenic is to first remove it from the mixture by Fischer's
distillation method, as described by one of us ('J. Soc. Chem. Ind.,' 1889,
viii. p. 256), and then to separate the tin and antimony electrolytically in

the residual solution.

The award of a grant of 50/. from the funds of the Association has-

enabled us to prosecute our researches without interruption. The branch
of the investigation with which we have been occupied has been the

determination of the precise nature of the furfural-yielding constituents
of straws.

     During the summers of 1894 and 1895 we made investigations on the
growing pkmt (barley) to ascertain the relative rate of accumulation of
these furfuroids in the plant tissues. For these investigations we selected
two of the typical experimental plots of the Royal Agricultural Society's
station at Woburn, the one being permanently unmanured, the other
receiving a maximum treatment with fertilisers, the pair thus representing
extreme conditions of soil nutrition. For the supplies of matei'ial we are
indebted to Dr. Voelcker, the Society's chemist. To Messrs. Voelcker we
are also indebted for assistance and co-operation in other ways, a large
part of our experimental work having been conducted at their labora-

tories.

      These investigations gave us positive indications, in general terms, as to^
the origin and distribution of the furf uroids, and their relationship to the
conditions of assimilation and secondary changes obtaining in the plant.

Having laid this necessary foundation, we have during the past year

applied ourselves to the particular problem of isolating these carbo-
hydrates in a condition suitable for the direct diagnosis of their constitu-
tion. The methods suggested by our general survey of their ' chemicaJ
ON THE CARBOHYDRATES OF CEREAL STRAWS.                                                     2G3

habit' were those of acid hydrolysis, and the problem resolved itself into
an investigation of the most favourable conditions of selective attack l)v
suitable acids. To simplify the problem we confined ourselves at first to
the celluloses proper, isolated from the straws by the usual methods of

treatment.

     The results of these investigations, which occupied us for six months,
are recorded in a paper communicated to the Chemical Society, and
published in the Journal for June 1896, p. 804.

     The method of attack employed consisted in digesting the celluloses

for fifteen minutes in a 1 per cent, solution of suljihuric acid, at a
temperature of 140-150° C.

    By this method we are enabled to separate the furfuroids almost
quantitatively, and in a condition of molecular simplicity. As obtained

from the celluloses, the reactions of these compounds are those of a pentose

y%monoformal C^Hj,03/ /CH,. It does not follow, however, that when
                          no/

isolated directly from the straws themselves, or from the stems in earlier

periods of growth, the whole of the furfuroids will be found to have this

constitution. Our subsequent work has been directed especially to this
question. The problem involved may be briefly stated as follows :

     The pentoses are formed in the plant from the hexoses. In this

process a terminal CHjOH group is eliminated. The mechanism of the

change, which must involve an oxidation to CO, is probably one of re-

arrangement, and not an oxidation from without. The pentose monoformal

represents the intermediate term of the series. The tendency to the

transformation must belong either to the special configuration of the

hexose, or to tlie special mode of aggregation of the molecules in the form

of a tissue substance or cellulose. Assuming the former, it may result

from these investigations that oiie of the hexoses as yet unknown will be

CH2OHfound to have its terminal  group in a specially sensitive condition

OHby reason of exceptional configuration, i.e., disposition of its alcoholic

groups. It is noteworthy, in fact, that the four hexoses, as yet unknown,

are of configurations suggesting a wider divei'gence from the better known

carbohydrates than these show amongst themselves. Thus :

celluloses (obtained from the mature straws), they yield only in small

part (20 per cent.) to the action of yeast (in neutral solution). On the

other hand, on hydrolysing ·withH2S04.2H90, a solution of the furfuroids

is obtained which yields much more readily to yeast, and the proportion

fermented amounted to 80 per cent.

Again, the early growth (barley) of the pi-esent year was submitted to

the treatment with dilute acid at high temperatures. In the solution the

constants bearing on this point were as under, calculated per cent, of the

After fermentation the solution contained traces only of furfuroids, and

the CuO reduction had fallen to 7-1.

Then, again, the osazones obtainable from the hydrolysed solutions

indicate important variations in the constitution of the furfuroids. The

solutions previously obtained from the celluloses at high temperatures gave

osazones of m.^x 14.5-155°. The solutions which we are now obtaining

from the plant tissues in their earlier stages of growth give osazones melt-

ing at temperatures e.xceeding 180°. On the other hand again, from the

lignocelluloses (which also yield their furfuroids to the acid solution at

high temperatures), hydrolysed pi-oducts are obtained, the osazones of

which melt at temperatures as far removed on the other side from the

melting points of the pentosazones, viz., at 110-120°.

It appears, therefore, that the furfuroids of the vegetable world are a

diversiiied group. In addition to the pentoses themselves they include

monoformal derivatives of the pentoses, and possibly also hexoses, cer-

tainly some of their derivatives. In the latter sub-group we may include

COOHGlycuronic acid,      (CH0H)4.C0H., as it also yields furfural as a

product of the action of hydrochloric acid.

   A complete investigation of these compounds therefore offers not

merely developments of the special chemistry of the carbohydrates, but

from their wide distribution in the plant world it is clear that they play

Aan important part in the general physiology of tissue formation.    good

deal of interest also evidently centres in the problem of their fate in

the processes of animal digestion. From the investigations of Stone,

Agr. Science, 1893, G) it appears that the tissue furfuroids of fodder

plants are in effect largely digested (60-80 per cent.) by the herbivora.

H. Weiske has also recently contributed to the same subject (' Bied. Centr.,'

25, 1 .3), and arrives at a similar conclusion. Though digested however,
it is still an open (juestion as to what nutritive value they may have.

It needs no furtlier demonstration at this stage that the subject calls

for extended investigation from various points of view : that it is a sub-

ject offering more than ordinary promise of positive results.

As stated above in this report, our immediate object at the present

time is the isolation of the furfuroids of the cereal stems in the earlier

Westages of growth.       have already found that the process of acid diges-

tion adopted in the case of the straw celluloses gives an equally satis-

factory separation of the furfuroids of the growing tissues. These we

--have to investigate by the standard methods 1 . ultimate analysis ; 2. con-

version into osazones ; 3. fermentation ; 4. oxidation to mono- and dibasic
acids ; and so forth. Such investigations have been in progress during

the last three months.

    consisting of Professor W. A. Tildeiv and Professor H. E. Arm-

     strong. {Drawn up hi/ Professor Armstrong.)

The completion of the investigation of the fourteen possible tricldoro-

naphthalenes (including tlie pi'oof that there are only fourteen) by Dr.

"Wynne and the writer (referred to in the last report), following that of

the ten possible dichloronaphthalenes, marks the termination of a section

--of our work perhaps of greater importance than any other, establishing,

as it does, two complete series of reference compounds by means of which

all other di- and tri-derivatives of naphthalene may be classified ; whilst,

at the same time, it aflbrds unquestionable confirmation of the accuracy of

the train of argument on which our present views of the constitution

of benzenoid compounds are based, and places the symmetrical structure of

naphthalene beyond all doubt.

Although great progress has been made in collecting the material

needed for the discussion of the laws which govern substitution in the

naphthalene series in the case of derivatives containing either halogens,

or nitro or other oxylic groups, or araidogen, or hydroxyl, before entering

on the final consideration of the results, it is essential to obtain fui'ther

evidence as to the manner in which the interactions occur, and particu-

larly as to the nature of the ' isomeric changes ' involved in the formation

--of many sulphonic acids an all-important, but seemingly very complex,

problem.

Much has been done during the year towards procuring the informa-

tion needed, especially in the case of the naphthols, which claim attention

--on account of the remarkable ' plasticity ' they manifest a plasticity that

seems to distinguish them from all other derivatives of naphthalene, due

apparently, at least in part, to the readiness with which they are con-

verted into keto-compounds of the type first discovered by Zincke.

OHIn order to study the influence of the  group undistxrbed, i.e., to

prevent any change taking place in it such as is involved in the formation

of a keto-compound, numerous exj^eriments have been made with the

methoxy- and ethoxynaphthalenes in the writer's laboratory. Dr. Lap-

worth has very kindly undertaken the study of the sulphonic acids of the

/3-compounds, and his results ' form a valuable addition to our knowledge,

as such substances afford well-defined crystalline sulphochlorides, sulphon-

amides, <tc., a class of derivatives which cannot be prepared from the

naphthol-acids. One very remarkable result has been arrived at by Dr.

Lapworth. The initial product formed on sulphonating a cold solution cf

/3-ethoxynaphthalene is the 2 : 1 acid in a nearly pure state ; but if the

product be kept at the ordinary temperature it spontaneously changes into

a mixture of the 2:1' and 2 : 3' acids, the change being complete, how-
ever, at the end of twelve to fifteen hours. When /)-methoxynaphthalene

is similarly treated it also yields practically nothing but the 2 : 1 acid,

          ' Cf. Proceedings of the Chemical Society, 1S05.

which gradually changes on keeping ; but in this case the change takes
place mucli more slowly, being incomplete at the end of five or six days.
The changes which apparently take place are those indicated by the

     It is difficult to believe that hydrolysis and resulphonation go on in
a stiff, pasty mass at ordinary temjjeratures, and the transformation would

seem to be more probably the result of direct isomeric change ; but much

must be done before this question can be finally discussed.
     a-Methoxy- and a-ethoxynaphthalene do not show any similar be-

haviour, and yield only the 1 : 4 acid, which apparently does not undergo

change when heated. ^Ir. Shelton, who has examined the acids at my

request, has prepared from them a series of crystallised derivatives, viz.

The behaviour of /3-methoxy- and ethoxynaphthalene towards bromine

is normal, products being obtained which correspond to those prepared

from /3-naphthol ; the investigation of the crystallographic relationship of
these promises to afford interesting results, and is being carried on by Mr.

Bennett.

It was shown by Mr. Rossiter and the writer that nitro-/3-naphthol

may be prepared directly from /3-n3phthol by means of nitrogen j^eroxide;

it appears that it may equally well be obtained by means of nitric acid. The

acid is carefully added to a very cold solution of the najjhthol in acetic acid,

and the solution is subsequently mixed with an excess of sodium sulphite.

But the yield is poor, seldom exceeding 40 per cent, of the theoretical

Aamount.  better result is obtained by very carefully nitrating chloro- or        I

bromonaphthol and reducing with sulphite.

The nitro-bromo-keto-naphthalene formed on nitrating dibromo-/3-

naphthol is readily and completely reduced by sodium sulphite, thus

making it possible to obtain a practically theoretical yield of nitro-bromo-

tration of the inhibiting effect of contiguous ortho groups to which Victor

Meyer has called attention so frequently.

In seeking to remove the atom of halogen in the a-position in the

derivatives of /vnaphthol containing halogens, 1-chloro- and 1 : 3 dichloro-

/3-naphthol were heated with sodium as well as potassium sulphite in the

hope of obtaining a-sulphonic acids ; the desired change was effected in
the case of the mono- but not in that of the di-chloro-compound.

Experiments carried out by Mr. Davis have led to the discovery of a

simple means of converting 1 : 3' dibromo into 3' bromo-/3-naphthol (m.p.

127°), consisting in the mere digestion of the dibromo-compound with a solu-

tion of hydrogen iodide                                                                                                     but, again, in this case, we have hitherto failed in

extending the use of the method to other derivatives containing halogens.

its acetyl derivative to the action of bromine ; the results show that the

     Mr. Davis has made much progress in an investigation of the nitro-
and nitrobromo-/3-ethoxyiiaphthalenes, paying special attention to their

crystallographic characters ; they are all intensely yellow-coloured sub-

stances, and apparently the colour is an intrinsic property. As the corre-

sponding phenol derivatives are colourless substances, it will be of interest
to institute an exact comparison between the two series.

     It should also be mentioned that, in the course of their work during the

year, Dr. Wynne and the writer have been able to confirm Cleve's observa-

tion that the 1 : 3 nitro-acid is among the products of the nitration of

naphthalene-/3-sulphonic acid (' Proceedings of the Chemical Society,' 1895,

No. 158, p. 238). This result is of interest, as no other case is known of

iJie direct formation of a ?neto-di-derivative of naj^hthalene.

The Teaching of Science in Elementary Schools.-- Eej)ort of the Com-
     mittee, consisting of Dr. J. H. Gladstone (Chairman), Professor

    H. E. Armstroxg (Secretary), Professor W. 11. Dunstan, Mr.

     George Gladstone, Sir John Lubijock, Sir Philip Magnus, Sir
     H. E. RoscoE, and Professor S. P. Thompson.

Your Committee have the satisfaction of reporting that the return of the

Education Department for this year .shows continued j^rogress in respect
ef the teaching of science subjects in Elementary Schools. Under the old
regime, which existed until 1890, 'English,' by which was meant the
·elements of English Grammar, including parsing and analysis of sen-
tences, was an obligatory subject if any of the class subjects were taught
in a school ; and as Geography has always enjoyed a considerable measure
of popularity, no room was practically left for Elementary Science.
Hence during the eight years ending with 1890 the number of depart-
ments of schools in which these three class subjects were taught was as

follows :

 --Class Subjects. Departments
            --

           ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 2G9

leaving 22,765 as tlie number of departments with which the foregoing
table has to deal. But it must be borne in mind that History is taken in
:^,597, and Needlework (for girls) in 7,39G departments, making, with the
other three subjects in the table, 44,687 in all. This shows an average of
nearly two class subjects to each department. As, however, thei'e were no
less than 5,872 departments in which only one class subject was taken, it

is evident that the plan of teaching one subject in the lower division of a
.school and another subject in the upper division, thus counting twice over
in the statistical table, is largely adopted. This is further borne out by
the fact that, while the Education Department only recognises two class
subjects taken by any individual scholar, there are 4,458 departments in
which three, and 284 in which four or five, of these class subjects are
taught. That Elementary Science is taught in 1,712 departments must,

therefore, be accepted with the reservation that in many cases it is only a

portion of the school that gets the benefit of this instruction.

     As a matter of fact, though the means of getting at the precise

numbers are not available, it can be asserted that Elementary Science has,

in very many cases, been taught only in the lower standards as a prepara-

tion for the study of scientific specific subjects in the upper portion of the

school. This arrangement has received the approval of Her Majesty'-s-

Inspectors, as well as of managers and teachers ; and this year the plan

has received further recognition by the introduction into the Day School

Code of 1896 of 'alternative coui-ses in English, Geography, and History
for schools which take other class subjects in the lowest three standards,'
the other subjects referred to (though there is nominally a considerable
choice) being practically Object Lessons or Elementary Science. Object

Lessons, in fact, are now made obligatory as a class subject in the three

lowest standai'ds if only one class subject be taken. It is satisfactory tO'

find that there is an actual diminution in the number of girls' departments
taking Needlework as a class subject as compared with former years ; not
that this art is neglected, but that it is more frequently taken now as an

additional subject for the one shilling grant, so leaving the field free for
two class subjects in addition.

     With increased attention to Object Lessons and Elementary Science in

the lower portion of the schools, it is reasonable to expect progress in
the teaching of the scientific specific subjects in the higher standards

                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and the return for the last five years confirms this expectation. The
number of scholars examined in the following subjects is shown in the
table annexed :

    Specific Subjects.-- Children
                 --

--270 KEPORT 189G.

     The numbers for the last year show a greater proportional increase
than in any previous year. This is especially noticeable in Algebra,
Domestic Economy, Mensuration, Mechanics, and Chemistry. The prin-
cipal falling-off is in the subject of Sound, Light, and Heat, probably due
to the very wide extent of that subject. Last year it was noted that
very nearly half the students in Mechanics had reached the second or

third stage in that subject ; this year's Report is not so favourable in
that particular, nearly three-fifths of the students in 1894-95 being in
the first stage. In Chemistry, on the other hand, there is an improve-

ment on last year, more than one-third of the whole number having been
examined in the second stage.

     Estimating the number of scholars in Standards Y., VI., and VII. at
090,000, the percentage of the number examined in these specific subjects
as compared with the number of children qualified to take them is 22*7 ;
but it should be remembered that many of the children take more than
one subject for examination. The following table gives the percentage for

each year since 1882 :

School Board in Hackney and the Tower Hamlets. The work has con-

tinued to develop, the most satisfactory element being the manner in

which the interest of the teachers themselves has been stimulated. Pro-

gress has been made in dealing with a much larger number of teachers

than hitherto ; and the teaching throughout the schools shows marked
improvement in quality and enthusiasm genuine efforts are now made

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

by the teachers to induce their scholars to think. The number of schools

attempting experimental work will soon be largely increased, owing to the

appointment of an additional demonstrator. The one in the Tower Hamlets

and Hackney Division has held classes for women teachers also in Experi-

mental Science, especially in i-elation to the  home                         thus  a large  number
                                                                          ;

of teachers are prepared to give some reality to their teaching in Domestic

Economy, and by it to benefit their scholai-s to a greater extent. It is
satisfactory to note that a request emanating from the teachers themselves
has led to the establishment of similar classes in South London under
another of the Board's demonstrators, and it is hoped before the winter

is past that like facilities will be offered to teachers in all parts cf the

metropolis.

    With regard to the instruction of pupil teachers, the expectation

referred to in the Report for 1894 has not been realised. No definite

course of practical science has been rendered obligatory, but the Educa-
tion Department has fallen back upon the old jilan of giving marks
for certificates from the Science and Art Department. These certificates

must, however, have been gained either in the year of the Queen's

Scholarship Examination or in the preceding year. It is also now pro-
vided that no student may be registered in the advanced stage of any

subject until he has passed the examination of the Department in the
elementary stage, or has passed some corresponding examination which

is considered by the Department to sufficiently meet the requirements of

Athe case.  change has also been made in the mode of assessing the

grants by the Science and Art Department, which it is believed will

conduce to the improvement of the study of science.

    With regard to the .syllabus used in the schools themselve.s, that of
mechanics is very largely taken, but much of it must necessarily be

taught with the sole object of giving information devoid of illustration

or experimental proof. It is not planned in accordance with modern
ideas of science teaching, and should be materially altered. The Domestic
Economy Syllabus (for girls) also needs complete reconstruction for similar

reasons.

     Your Committee consider that the time has come when Educational
authorities should definitely lay down a scheme of Elementary Experi-

mental Science, to be taken by every scholar before he is allowed to

specialise into the various branches of science.

The all-important point in elementary schools is to train teachers to

regard science teaching as a means of mental culture, and to get them

to teach accordingly. The courses in the training colleges and pupil

teachers'  centres  appear  to work  in  exactly  the                        opposite  direction                                      so

of scientific method is apt to be almost entirely ignored.

            ON PROXIMATE CONSTITUENTS OF COAL.            341

     In 1874 Dondorff drew attention to the occurrence in several West-
phalian gas coals of a blackish solid, with a reddish brown colour in
reflected light, having a brown streak. This substance is found in thin
leaflets on this coal, and is almost entirely soluble in ether, forming a
light yellow solution, which fluoresces not unlike solutions of the salts of

quinine.

    By the extraction of a Westphalian gas coal with ether Muck has

obtained an ethereal solution of a similar character, and from it obtained
a solid of the following percentage composition :

             C=87-22, H=9-20, 0=2-29, S=l-29 (nitrogen absent).

     This substance, when heated in a platinum crucible, leaves a coke-like
residue, amounting to 32-09 per cent. The author considers this substance
to be widely diffused in coal, and has shown it to exist in varying amounts
in different parts of the same seam. Associated with this investigation is
that of P. Siepmann, who has submitted the gas coal of the Pluto mine,
Westphalia, to a systematic extraction with chloroform, ether, and alcohol,

obtaining the following results :

     The chloroform exti-act amounted to 1-25 per cent, of the coal ; the
solution, dark yellow to brown in colour, possessed a strong green fluo-
 rescence ; the composition of the extract was

             0=83-46, H=7-93, = 4-27, N=2-71, S=l-63.

     The residue, after extraction with chloroform, gave, when treated with
ether, a light yellow solution having a bluish green fluorescence, from which
a solid was obtained amounting to 0*3 per cent, of the coal, and containing

                           0=84-82, H=10-51 and 0=4-67.

     The residue treated with alcohol gave a solution similar in character
to the ethereal solution. The amount removed by the alcohol was 0-25
per cent, of the coal, and the composition of the dissolved solid was found
to be

                                0=72-52, H=10-08, 0=17-4.

After the above treatment the residual coal was again extracted with

chloroform, which removed 075 per cent, of the coal, and left on evapo-

ration a dark brown, pitch-like mass, which gave the following results on

analysis :

            H N0=78-82, = 8-56, 0=9-97, (trace), S=2-65.

     The last chloroform solution was dark brown in colour and feebly

fluorescent.

     The composition of the coal before and after this treatment is given
below :

After treatment , , . .

     According to H. Reinsch, alcohol extracts from coal a substance sup-
posed to be altered ' chenopodin,' a body which the author had discovered
in the sap of Melilotus alhus, and to which he attributes the composition
C12HJ3O8N. In 1885 P. Reinsch concluded that coal consists of two
                                                                        '

classes of substances, one soluble in alkalis, forming coloured solutions,

and a second insoluble.

By the use of phenol as a solvent E. Guignet has extracted from

2 to 4 per cent, of a brown solid from coal, which is precipitated from the

solution by alcohol. The finely powdered coal treated with nitric acid

yields solutions containing oxalic acid and trinitroresorcinol ; the insoluble

residue contains apparently nitro-compounds, or bodies similar to nitro-

Acellulose.  portion of this residue is dissolved by caustic alkalis and

ammonia, forming brown-coloured solutions.

Guignet, led by the formation of trinitroresorcinol, as mentioned above,

attempted to obtain resorcinol by fusion of the coal with caustic soda and

distillation in a bath of molten lead, but obtained ammonia and aniline

only. The residue after this treatment was, however, found to be partially

dissolved by water, forming dark brown solutions, from which acids pre-

cipitated out humus-like substances. Guignet concludes these bodies are

derived from the cellulose-residues of tlie coal, and that the trinitro-

resorcinol owes its oi'igin to the resinous and wax-like constituents.

     During the session 1889-90 Mr. Saville Shaw, Lecturer in Chemistry

at the Durham College of Science, Newcastle-upon Tyne, made some ex-

periments on the action of a mixture of concentrated sulphuric and nitric

acids on bituminous coal. The coal, in a finely powdered condition, was

allowed to remain for three weeks in contact with the mixed acids, and

then poui'ed into a large volume of water, filtered and thoroughly washed.

The dried residue differs but slightly in appearance from the original coal,

but had evidently undergone change in composition, as after this treat-

ment it gave as much as 77 per cent, of ' volatile matter,' whereas the coal

contained but 27 per cent. ;  further when heated in a test-tube  it                        '

                                                                      ' pufis

Awith slight flame, resembling in this respect gun-cotton.  considerable

portion of this ' nitro-coal ' is soluble in caustic alkalis, yielding \ery dark
brown solutions, from which on acidifying bulky dark brown precipitates

are formed. The precipitates, washed and dried, form brilliantly black

friable masses, which have lost the semi- explosive properties of the original

'nitro-coal.' Methyl alcohol dissolves some 11 per cent, of the 'nitro-

coal,' the solution yielding a black scaly product on evaporation, which,

when heated, suddenly decomposes, leaving a very bulky residue of cai'bon.

Attempts to prepai-e reduction products from this nitro-coal were un-

successful.

In a note published in the ' Proceedings of the Chemical Society

(1891-92, p. 9) R. J. Friswell described the results obtained by treating

finely powdered coal with dilute nitric acid ; a considerable jjortion of the

coal is thus converted into a black insoluble acid, which behaves very much

as a nitro-compound.

Mention should also be made of the investigations of Mr. Watson

Smith, published in 1891, on the soluble and resinoid constituents of

bituminous coal. The soluble material extracted by benzene from a

Japanese coal Mr. Watson Smith has shown to contain phenols, nitro-

genous organic bases, and also some aromatic hydrocarbons.

In a previous report experiments with various solvents on a bitu-

minous coal from the Hutton seam in the county of Durham were

referred to, but, owing to the small yields obtained, this method of

attacking the problem as to the nature of the proximate constituents of

coal has been relinquished.

The oxidation of the finely powdered coal with aqueous solutions of
                                                                                    --

potassium permanganate, in some cases made alkaline with caustic potash,

appeared to offer a more promising method of attack. The coal uses up

very considerable quantities of the permanganate, and dark brown solu-

tions are obtained. From these solutions it has been attempted, by the

aid of the formation of insoluble salts, to isolate some of the acids which

result from the oxidation of the coal in this way. The difficulties met

with arising from the unsatisfactory properties of many of these salts,

which are usually obtained in the form of gelatinous, clayey solids, difficult

to wash and obtain in a state of purity suitable for analysis, have led to

the abandonment of this reagent.

More promising results have been obtained by acting upon the coal

with dilute hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate. Mr. J. A. Smythe,

B.Sc. of the Durham College of Science, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, has under-

taken the investigation of this action for the purposes of this committee.

    When finely divided coal is boiled for several hours with dilute hydro-

chloric acid, and potassium chlorate added from time to time, the coal

gradually assumes a brown colour, and a brown solid collects on the

surface of the yellow liquid. The coal, after lengthened treatment, is

filtered off, washed, and dried at 100° C. The product is invariably found

to have increased in weight, and when extracted with alcohol or acetone

some 30 to 35 per cent, of the material is dissolved out by either of these

solvents                                        of the two, acetone is the more powerful solvent, leaving a coal-
                                             ;

like insoluble residue. The solution obtained in this manner is next dis-

tilled, and after removal of the sohent a dark reddish brown resinous

mass is left, which, when finely ground, forms a dark brown homogeneous

powder. The finely divided powder was extracted with benzene ; the
portion insoluble in benzene was treated with alcohol, in which some

readily dissolved, leaving a residue sparingly soluble in hot alcohol.

The benzene solution, after removal of the benzene, leaAes a dark

I'esinous mass, which, when ground, forms a brown powder, which is dis-

solved not only by benzene and acetone, but also by ethei", chloroform,

glacial acetic acid, phenol, and nitrotoluene, but is insoluble in carbon

disulphide, petroleum ether, and water. The solutions of this body are

all dark brown, almost black, and from these it is always deposited in an

amorphous condition. The analysis of this substance gave the following

results, from which a formula, C3oH22ClgOio, has been deduced :

      Although the action of hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate on
the coal is a slow one, it is much more thorough in its attack than other
oxidising agents tried. The coal left after treatment and removal of
oxidised product with acetone, when submitted to a second treatment
with acid and chlorate of potash, is still further attacked and converted
into products similar to those formed in the first instance, and it appears
that the proportion of oxidised product increases with each successive
oxidation. To study the mode of action, 10 grams of tlie coal were boiled
with dilute acid and 20 grams of chlorate of potash, added in small
quantities at a time ; the action continued for forty-four hours. The
dried product was found to have increased by 21 per cent, in weight, and
of this 62"7 per cent, was dissolved by acetone. The residue left after
treatment with acetone weighed ·5'27 grams, which was again oxidised for
forty hours. Of the dried product 74 per cent, was removed by acetone,
and the remaining 1"26 gram, after a third and similar treatment, gave a
product from which acetone dissolved some 7 7 "8 per cent., leaving
0"32 gram of coal-like insoluble residue.

     The analysis of the coal after it had been treated four time with these
reagents shows an increased percentage in carbon and Ijydrogen and the

presence of a trace of chlorine.

     From the above it is evident that the coal substance is powerfully

attacked by hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate, but the products of
this action are for the most part complex substances, from which at

present but little information can be derived as to the nature of the

materials from Avhich they are formed. These bodies appear to be acidic
in properties, and form dark brown solutions with caustic alkalis and
ammonia, from which metallic salt solutions, such as barium chloride,
lead nitrate, silver nitrate, &c., precipitate out dark coloured gelatinous
salts, which are difficult to obtain in a state of sufiicient purity for
analysis. The attempts to obtain information as to the constitution of
these chlorinated compounds have up to thepresent yielded no- satisfactory

results.

     The compositioia and physical properties of these chlorinated com-
pounds recall those described by Messrs. Cross and Bevan in their inves-

--tigations of jute for example, the substance described by these authors as

tetrachlorobastin (C33H3yCl.<0,g), from which they have obtained proto-
catechuic acid by fusion with potash.

     The treatment of cannel coal with hydi'ochloric acid and potassium
chlorate results in the production of compounds similar to those obtained
from the coal of the Hutton seam ; the oxidation product soluble in alcohol
contained some 24- 1.3 per cent, of chlorine.

   A sample of bitumen submitted to a similar treatment gave a product

from which ether dissolves about two-thirds, the ethereal solution on
evaporation leaving a dark viscous residue, which was found to contain

11 "06 per cent, of chlorine.
      Whilst postponing for the present the further study of these chlorinated

compounds, Mr. Smythe has begun the investigation of the action of
hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate in ' brown coal.' For this
purpose samples of brown coal were obtained from Briihl, near Cologne :
this variety of coal is much more readily attacked than the coal from
Durham. It is also noteworthy that whilst the dry oxidised product from
the latter weighs more than the coal, in the case of the brown coal there
is a notable decrease in the weight. Further, there is a much larger
--346 REPORT 189G.

proportion of the oxidised product soluble in acetone, as the following
details of an experiment with 10 grains of linely ground coal show.

     Ten grams of brown coal boiled for 1 2 hours with dilute hydrochloric
acid and 20 grams of potassium chlorate ; the insoluble mass was filtered
off, washed, and dried. The dried solid weighed 6 82 grams : of this 72-4
per cent, was soluble in acetone. The portion insoluble in acetone, viz.,
1"88 gram, was treated for 12 hours more with hydrochloric acid and
potassium chlorate, giving a solid product of 1*49 gram, of which 79"8
per cent, was dissolved by acetone. The chlorinated compounds formed
in this manner are very similar in appearance to those obtained from the
Hutton seam coal, and probably of a similar character. The crude solid
left after the evaporation of the acetone was found to contain some 22-93

per cent, of chlorine.

     The investigation of these substances as also the products formed by
the oxidation of brown coal with solutions of potassium permanganate

are still in progress.

 The Production of Haloids from Pure Materials.--Interim Peport of a

     Committee, consisting of Professor H. E. Armstrong, Professor W.
     R, DuNSTAN, Mr. C. H. Bothamley, and Mr. W. A. Shenstone

       {Secretary^ (Prawn up hij the Secretary.')

 Considerable progress has been made with the work of this Committee
 during the past year. The difficulties mentioned in past reports having
 at length been overcome, a number of experiments are in hand which will
 it is believed be completed early in 1897. Meanwhile some of the material
 prepared has been made useful for some subsidiary investigations which

 also are approaching completion. No further grant is at present necessary.

 But it is recommended that the Committee be reappointed.

--Tlie Action of Light upon Pyed Colours. Report of Committee,

      consisting of Professor T. E. Thorpe (CiLairman), Professor J. J.

     Hummel (Secretary), Dr. W. H. Perkin, Professor W. J. Russell,

      Captain Abney, Professor "W. Stroud, and Professor R. Meldola.
      (Prawn up by the Secretary.)

During the past year (1895-96) the work of this Committee has been
continued, and a large number of wool and silk patterns, dyed with
various natural and artificial blue and green colouring matters, have
been examined with respect to their power of resisting the fading action

 of light.

     The general method of preparing the dyed patterns, and the manner
of exposing them under glass, with free access of air and moisture, were
the same as already adopted in previous years.

      The thanks of the Committee are again due to James A. Hirst, Esq.,
in whose grounds the patterns were exposed at Adel, near Leeds.

      Each dyed pattern was divided into six pieces, one of which was
protected from the action of light, while the others were exposed for
different periods of time. These ' periods of exposure ' were made equivalent
to those adopted in previous years by exposing, along with the patterns,
special series of ' standards,' dyed with the same colouring matters as were
then selected for this purpose. The standards were allowed to fade to the
same extent as those which marked off the ' fading period ' in previous years,
before being renewed or before removing a set of dyed patterns from the
action of light. The patterns exposed during the past year are therefore
comparable, in respect of the amount of fading action to which they have
been submitted, with the dyes already reported upon.

     The patterns were all put out for exposure on July 19, 1895, cer-

--tain sets being subsequently removed on the following dates : August 12,

September 3, September 20, 1895 ; April 1, July 9, 1896. Of these five
'periods of exposure' thus marked off, periods 1, 2, 3 were equivalent to
each othtT in fading power, whereas periods 4 and 5 were each equivalent
to four of the first period in this respect ; hence five patterns of each
colour have been submitted respectively to an amount of fading equal

--to 1, 2, 3, 7, and 11 times that of the first 'fading period' selected viz.,

July 19 to August 12, 1895.
     The dyed and faded patterns have been entered in pattern-card books

in such a manner that they can be readily compared with each other.
--348 KEPORT 1896.

     The following tables give the general result of the exposure experi-
ments made during the year 1895-96, the coloui-s being divided, according
to their behaviour towards light, into the following five classes : Very
fugitive, fugitive, moderately fast, fast, very fast.

     The initial numbers refer to the order of the patterns in the pattern-
books. The S. and J. numbers refer to Schultz and Julius's ' Tabel-

larische Uebersicht der kiinstlichen organischen Farbstoffen.'
     In the case of colouring matters requiring mordants, the particular

mordant employed is indicated in brackets after the name of the dye-

stuff.

                 Class I. Vert Fugitive Colours. (Wool.)

    Many of the colours of this class have faded so rapidly that at the end

of the first 'fading period' (July 19 to August 12, 1895) only a very faint
colour remains, and at the end of the fifth period (one year) all traces of
the original colour have disappeared, the woollen cloth being either white
or of a yellowish or greyish appearance.

  -- --Notes. Certain colours in this class e.g. Gentianine, &c. fade

during the first period to a grey colour possessing a moderate degree of

fastness. Neutral Blue is characterised by fading to a dull reddish colour,

Gallanilic Indigo P S and Diamine Blue 6 G, when completely faded^

leave the wool of a pronounced yellowish tint.

                         Class II. Fugitive Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class show very marked fading at the end of the
second 'fading period ' (August 12 to September 3, 1895), and after a year's

exposure they have entirely faded, or only a tint remains.

--Note. That Gentiana Blue 6B has proved to be fast is very remark-

able, since the basic colours, and particularly those of the triphenyl-

methane group, are usually so fugitive. During the first fading period

the bloom of the colour disappears, but the remaining colour fades very

little even throughout the period of a whole year.

                 Class V. Very Fast Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class show a very gradual fading during the dif-
ferent periods, and even after a year's exposure a moderately good colour

remains.

--Notes. The gi-eat fastness of the Brilliant Alizarin Blues is remark-

able, since they belong to a group of colouring matters which has not hitherto

furnished fast colours. The same remark applies to Coelestine Blue,

although this colour is not so fast as the foregoing. The fastness of the

various Alizarin Blues (oxyketone colours) is proverbial, and along with

the colours just named they may well be regarded as worthy competitors of

indigo for the production of fast blues. The chief difference of behaviour

of Indigo Blue and some of the Alizarin Blues is that the latter tend to

acquire a reddish tint, whereas the former does not.

The remarkable fastness of Prussian Blue on wool is such that the

    Notes.--The great fastness of the quinone-oxime colours when fixed
with iron mordant is worthy of special notice. The fastness of Coerulein

green as a Triphenylmetliane Colour is also remarkable, but although

Ccerulein is usually classed as a Triphenylmethane Colour, its constitution

when fully determined may cause it to be more properly placed in some

other class.

                                              Silk Patterns.

     Most of the foregoing colours were also dyed on silk, and the patterns
were exposed to light along with those on wool. The relative fastness of
the various colours was, for the most part, the same as on wool, the

                                                                                                            Aa2

differences observed being too unimportant to necessitate a special classi-

fication for silk.

     The Chinese natural dyestuff Lo-kav fixed on silk with alum mordant
is much faster than the same colour fixed on cotton from a soap bath. It
was not found possible to apply it satisfactorily to wool.

     Vat Indigo Blue is apparently less fast on silk than on wool, and on
this fibre some of the Alizarin Blues, and notably the Brilliant Alizarin
Blues, are much faster than Indigo Blue. As on wool, so on silk, Prussian

Blue is faster to light than all other blues.

     J. WiNDOES, appointed to open further sections in the neighbourhoodj

(About 12 feet of Inferior Oolite strata can be made out below.)

The faulted state of the bank prevents exact measui'ement of the

series now assumed to be Fullonian. These beds had previously been

classed with the Inferior Oolite. Notwithstanding the great care taken

in making a practically vertical section, a series of Great Oolite beds was
found at a much lower level than the Slate. The error was indicated in

the Second Report, and the greater part of beds Nos. 18 to 26 liave to be

excised from the list.

The additions to our knowledge consist mainly in the discovery of the

strata with vertical plant-markings (evidently the equivalent of the

Lower Estuarine Series of the Northamptonshire Inferior Oolite), and in

the particulars given of the thickness of the higher beds of the Inferior

Oolite and the FuUonian strata. Fawler, two miles distant, has been

supposed to mark the virtual disappearance of the Inferior Oolite. Sir

Joseph Prestwich, however, had grouped with the Inferior Oolite certain

beds (14 feet 6 inches thick) which had been proved in the boring at

Wytham,  near  Oxford '                              and Mr. H. B, Woodward has classed with
                                                  ;

the Inferior Oolite Series 30 feet of strata proved in a boring at Witney.^

These correlations were inferential, but the facts now brought forward

give them support.

The Committee have the honour to report that during the last year 196

photographs have been received, bringing the total number in the collection

Aup to 1,412.  detailed list is annexed : it sliows that the Committee are

largely indebted to Mr. Godfrey Bingley and to Mr. W. Whitaker. The

latter has sent a considerable number of photographs, many of them old

ones, which it would have been difficult to obtain otherwise ; the former,
in addition to a set to be specially mentioned later on, has contiibuted a

beautiful series of views taken along the Yorkshire coast, which we trust

is a first contribution to the survey of the entire coast suggested by Mr.

Woodall some time ago. Mr. Bingley also sends photographs of the re-

markable perched blocks about Norber, near Clapham. To these donors

and to Miss Andrews, Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Atchison, Mr. Flowers, Mr.

Piquet, Mr. Preston, Mr. W. Sinclair, Mr. Small, Mr. Stilgoe, Mr. A. O.

Walker, and Mr. H. B. Woodward, to the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union,

and to the Leeds Geological Association, the thanks of the Committee are

especially due.

and in those of former years follows. From this it will be seen that, while

some counties have been surveyed by the camera in considerable detail,

in others little or nothing has been done. It will be well, therefore, to

direct special effort towards having the geological phenomena of these

counties photographically registered.

    No special attempt has been made this year to obtain prints in order

to see how many would be likely to flow in without sending circula,rs out
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the result is apparent on an analysis of the list. But for the photographs

of three contributors the number would be exceptionally small. This

shows that constant effort is required to complete the collection, and it

must not be relaxed if it is desired that the work should be brought to a

satisfactory conclusion. Circulars must be regularly sent to the Field

Clubs and Natural History Societies, and to other regular and likely con-

tributors, a constant if small expense being undertaken by the Com-

mittee.

Not many of the photographs received this year have yet been

mounted, and there are still some of the older ones which require mount-

ing or remounting before it is possible to display the whole collection at

its new home in Jermyn Street, to which the whole collection has now

been sent ; the bulk of it can, however, be inspected on application at the

Library at the Museum of Practical Geology at 28 Jermyn Street, S.W.
The method adopted by the Committee, after much consideration, has

proved to be an unqualified success, and not the least advantage is that
it permits of the periodical rearrangement of the collection, which is so
essential. This emphasises the necessity, often urged by the Committee,
that prints should, whenever possible, be sent unmounted. The direc-
tions sent by the donors with regard to mounting are strictly adhered

to, and if donors wish to mount their own prints the standard cards will
always be sent them for the purpose.

ON PHOTOGRAPHS OF GEOLOGICAL INTEREST.  359

is included in the following list, and the Yorkshire Geological and Poly-
technic Society has kindly sent a copy of the number of its 'Proceedings
containing the paper. The Secretaries will be glad to receive not only
prints of photographs so reproduced, but, if possible, a copy of the plates

or publication containing the reproduction of them.

     Since the Committee began their labours a number of bodies, such as
the Geologists' Association and the South-Eastern Union of Natural
History Societies, have undertaken the acquisition of photographs of
geological interest, and in some cases, as in "Warwickshire, a complete
photographic survey, including that of geological phenomena, is in pro-

gress. It is desirable that duplicate prints of such photographs as are

of geological interest should lind their way into the central and j^arent

collection.

     The Committee ask for their reappointment, with a small grant tr
enable them to make a special effort to reach those localities which have no
at present contributed much or at all to the collection.

      SEVENTH LIST OF GEOLOGICAL PHOTOGRAPHS.

                                          (to august 1896.)

   --Note. This list contains the subjects of geological photographs,

copies of which have been received by the Secretaries of the Committee
since the publication of the last report. Photographers are asked to
affix the registered numbers, as given below, to their negatives for con-

venience of future reference. Their own numbers, where given, are
added, in the same order, to enable them to do so.

     Copies of photographs desired can, in most instances, be obtained
from the photographer direct, or from the officers of the Local Society
under whose auspices the views were taken.

    The price at which copies may be obtained depends on the size of the

print and on local circumstances, over which the Committee have no

control.

     The Committee find it necessary to reiterate the fact that they do not
assume the copyright of any i^hotographs included in this list. Inquiries
respecting photographs, and applications for permission to reproduce

them, should not be addressed to the Committee, but to the photographers

direct.

    Copies of photographs should in future be sent to W. W. Watts,

28 Jermyn Street, London, S.W.

366 REPORT-- 1896.

--Erratic Blocks of the British Isles. First Beport of the Committee,

     consistinrj of Professor E. Hull (Chairman), Professor T. G.
    BoNNEY, Mr. P. F. Kendall {Secretary), Mr. C. E. De Rance,

    Professor W. J. Sollas, Mr. E. H, Tiddeman, Eev. S. IST. Har-

     rison, Mr. J. Horne, cvnd Mr. Dugald Bell. (Brawn up by the

       Secretary.)

The Committee were reconstituted at the Ipswich meeting of the Asso-
ciation, so that the erratics of the whole of the British Isles now come

within their purAdew. The Scottish Corresponding Societies have heen
invited to aid in devising a scheme of organisation by which the desired

--end the collection of significant facts regarding the distribution of ice-
--borne blocks may most speedily and Avith the least waste of power be

attained. Several Societies have made a favourable response, and it is
hoped that before the presentation of the next report a considerable body

of evidence will have been collected.

     In England the work of organisation has been advanced a notable way

by the formation of a boulder committee by the Lincolnshire Naturalists'
Union on similar lines to that which has done, and is doing, such valuable

systematic work in Yorkshire. The Rev. W. Tuckwell has accepted the

secretaryship of the new organisation, and his well-known energy and
enthusiasm are guarantees that the work will be carried on persistently
and thoroughly. The proximity of the active sub-committee working in

the East Riding of Yorkshire has been a great advantage to the Lincoln-

shire Committee, who have had the advantage of the advice and active

co-operation in the field of several experienced boulder hunters from
Yorkshire.

     Mr. Tuckwell's first report records 102 bouldei-s. These include many

examples of characteristic Scandinavian rocks, such as the well-known

Augite-syenite and Rhomb-porphyry. One example of the former rock,
observed near Louth, is the largest specimen yet found in England, and it

is satisfactory to learn that Mr. Tuckwell has taken effective measures for
its preservation. Another notable record is that of three specimens of
Shap granite, the first recorded in Lincolnshire, one of which was found
imbedded in undisturbed glacial deposits at South Ferriby, while another
was found built into a tenth-century Saxon wall at Irby.

      The Yorkshire Boulder Committee have again clone most excellent
 work, the value of whicli is enhanced by care displayed by the secretar}',
Mr. Tate, to investigate personally all boulders of more common interest
or novelty, and by the petrological knowledge which he brings to the

 work.

      The reports sent in from the East Riding are an enumeration of no
 fewer than 2,600 boulders, and complete an exhaustive catalogue of all
 the Ijoulders at present visible in the clifi's or on the beach along the whole
 coast-line of Holderness from Spurn Point to Bridlington, a distance of

 36 miles. Among these were many examples of Augite-syenite and

 Rhomb-porphyry.

    A report by Messrs. Herbert Muff and Thomas Sheppard brings out

 the extraordinary prevalence of boulders of Shap granite at Robin
 Hood's Bay where no fewer than 81, varying from a few inches up to
             ON THE ERRATIC ]5L0CKS OF THE BRITISH ISLES.                                                                                                                     367

3 feet 6 inches in diameter, were observed. In contrast to this, Messrs.

Davis and Stather report that among the 133 large boulders (1 foot and
upward in diameter) and thousands of smaller ones observed by them on
four miles of coast between Redcar and Saltburn, not a single Shap
boulder was seen, nor any Augite-syenite nor Rhomb-porphyry.

A. very valuable series of records come from the valley of the Yorkshire

Calder, the boulders consisting, as in previous reports, of Lake District

igneous rocks and some from the Carboniferous series ; but the special

interest of those now reported is that the route taken by the stones is
now indicated by the completion of a continuous train of erratics over the
Walsden Pass at Summit and thence to Todraorden.

     The anomalous and isolated group found at Barnsley is reported upon.
The constituent boulders include basalts and granites of types not recog-
nised elsewhere in the district, and the group must be regarded with a
good deal of suspicion, especially in view of the fact that it is in close

proximity to a navigable canal.

     Reports are also furnished of the boulders in a remarkable detached

patch of Boulder- clay at Balby, near Doncaster. At this place was found

a handsome boulder of Shap granite, the most southerly example yet
observed on the eastern side of the Pennine Chain.

     It is gratifying to learn that, at the i-equest of the Doncaster Natural

History and Mici'oscopical Society, this interesting boulder and another
of Lake District andesite have been placed by the Corporation of Don-
caster in the Free Library. The Yorkshire records conclude with a report

upon the stones found in the great crescentic drift-ridges which run across
the Vale of York respectively at Escrick and at York itself. In both of
these boulders of Shap granite were found.

In Lancashire but little has been done during the past                                                                                                 year                   but Mr.
                                                                                                                                                                           ;

J. W. Stather, of Hull, found a large pebble of Shap granite on the

shores of the Mersey at the Dingle, near Liverpool. Mr. Lomas found at

the same place a drusy granite resembling that of Goat Fell, Arran.

The  latter  is  the   first                                              example      found    in England                                        but  the  Rev.              S. N.

Harrison sends records of both the granites of Arran and a ' felspar-

porphyry ' of the same island, from the Isle of Man.

     The Belfast Field naturalists continue their work in the north-east of
Ireland. It is interesting to observe that Foraminifera are found in

many of the Boulder-clays of their district. Pebbles of the Riebeckite

Eurite of Ailsa Craig are very abundant in the Boulder- clays near

Belfast.

      All the boulders tabulated (p . 374) were in situ in the clay or were close
to the cliffs from which they had recently fallen. For convenience of com-
parison the 36 miles of coast are divided into Sections A, B, C, «Sz;c.,
usually indicated by some well-marked natural feature or landmark. The

    Hawkshaw, aiul Hon. P. Fawcett, appointed to consider a i/roject

    for investigating the 8tr%ictv,re of a Coral Reef htj Boring and

      Sounding.

As mentioned in the report presented to the Ipswich meeting, the

Council of the Royal Society had inquired from the Admiralty whether

the Government would be able to assist an expedition by putting a sur-

veying vessel at its disposal. In the course of the autumn a repl)'^ to this

Myinquiry was received to the effect that  Lords would be willing to

convey the members of the expedition and their apparatus, as far as pos-

sible, to Funafuti, which had been already suggested as a favourable spot

Afor the investigation.  grant of 800^. was made from the fund placed

by Government at the disposal of the Royal Society, and a further grant

was made from funds administered by the Council, with the result that

Professor Sollas, with Mr. Stanley Gardner, of Cambridge, as naturalist,

and assistants from Sydney, sailed from that harbour in H.M.S. 'Penguin,'

commanded by Captain Field, on May 1. But, even with the above

assistance, the expedition could not have been sent had it not been for the

great help given in Sydney by Professors Stuart and David, by Mr. W. H. S.
Slee, Chief Inspector of Mines, and by the Department of Mines of New

South Wales. It is due to them that boring tools and workmen have

been lent by that Department, with the result that the cost of the under-

taking has been practically halved.

News has been already received frorii Professor Sollas. The first

attempts unfortunately proved unsuccessful, as a quicksand was struck, at

a depth of about 65 feet, which choked the machine ; but fresh apparatus

was on its way from Sydney, and it was hoped that more favourable

results would attend the next trial. The news of that is expected shortly.

The grant of 10^. was drawn and applied towards the necessary expenses

preliminary to the expedition. As the cost of the undertaking is almost

certain to exceed the sum granted by the Royal Society, the Committee

suggest that a liberal grant be made in aid of the boring, and that it be

placed in the hands of a small committee.
--378 REPORT 1896.

  --p.g. During the meeting news was received from Professor Sollas

that the second attempt had been defeated, at a slightly greater depth, by
a similar cause, the difficulty being increased by the presence of hard
lumps of coral, like boulders, in the loose stuff. Thus the attempt to
obtain a boring deep enough to throw much light on the structure had

been a failure. Still the expedition had succeeded in ascertaining many

facts which it was hoped would be intei'esting and valuable.

                                                     I. Introduction.

Since the presentation of their interim Report last year on the investi-
gation of the shell-bearing deposits in Kintyre, the members of the
Committee have carried out boring operations with the view of proving
the extension of the shelly clay near Cleongart. The grant from the
British Association having been insufficient for the work, the Committee
cordially acknowledge a grant in aid from the Council of the Royal
Society of London, obtained through the courtesy and kindly interest of
Sir Archibald Geikie.

                                      II. Geographical Position.

The shell- bearing deposits in Kintyre, investigated by the Committee

during 1895-6, occur at three localities on the west side of the peninsula

and to the north of Machrihanish Bay (see maps, figs. 1 and 4). They

are exposed in three stream sections :              (1)        in Tangy Burn                                                    (2) in Drumore
                                                                                                                             ;

Burn                      (3)  in  a  stream  near  Cleongart, which  run                  more                                 or  less  parallel
                       ;

with each other in a westerly direction towards the Atlantic.

             III. Previous Observations regarding the Shelly Clay, <&c.

     In 1852 Professor James Nicol, of Aberdeen,' chronicled the important
fact that ' many of the striated boulders in the clays of Kintyre are
apparently derived from a distance, and some detached travelled stones are

seen on the surface.' He further observed near Macharioch several large

boulders of white granite, ' resembling the granite of Arran, which is the
nearest place where this rock occurs in situ, though at the distance of
23 miles across the deep hollow of Kilbrennan Sound.' Striated rocks
were noted at several localities, and he gives a few instances from the

                                     ' Quart. Journ. Geol. Soo., vol. viii. p. 406.

overlies shell-bearing clay. The latter is dark grey in colour, and con-
trasts strongly with the overlying boulder-clay, which is of a dull reddish
brown. The two clays are equally distinct in composition.

     ' The shell-bearing clay as exposed in this section is seen standing up

in the boulder clay like a boss or knoll. ... At the greatest part visible

it is 13 feet high, and it can be traced as it thins down, along the edge of
the streamlet for a distance of 60 or 70 yards. Its exact depth could not
be ascertained, but as the rock is seen at a short distance on either hand,
it is probably not more than a few feet deeper than what is exposed.

   --' The fossils in this deposit are but thinly met with molluscs in

particular are rare Leda 2]yg7ncea being the prevailing shell, with an
occasional Leda jxrnula, Venibs ovata, and a few fragments of other species.
These were submitted to Mr. J. G. Jeffreys, and at least two of them have
proved to be of much interest, viz., Fecten Groenlandicus and Montaciota

elevata.

     ' Pecten Groenlandicus has been met with on the east coast at Mon-
trose, Errol and Ehe, but not before in the west of Scotland. . . .
Montacuta elevata is an Arctic species, and new to the glacial clays of

Britain.

' Ostracoda and Foraminifera are more numerously represented in this

deposit, eighteen species of the former and twenty-three of the latter

having been obtained.'

   A list of the organic remains from the shelly clay of Tangy Glen is

appended to the foregoing paper.

   --Drumore Burn. Another exposure of shelly clay was observed

by Mr. Symes, of H.M. Geological Survey, in the course of his detailed

survey of the peninsula of Kintyre. In the Drumore Burn 3 miles N.

of Tangy Glen the shelly clay appears to underlie reddish b(julder-clay,

--and yields broken fragments of shells.
    Cleongart. By far the best section of shelly clay yet observed in

Kintyre was discovered by Mr. Alex. Gray, of Campbelton, in a stream

near Cleongart, about 4 miles N. of Tangy Glen, where it is overlaid by a

Agreat thickness of boulder-clay.  large collection of organic remains was

obtained by Mr. Gray from this deposit, which were named by Dr.

Robertson, and appear in the list appended to this Report.

The Committee desire to acknowledge the valuable services rendered

by Mr. Gray in the course of their investigations during 189.5-96. He

not only placed at their disposal his knowledge of the locality and his

observations on this deposit, but he also superintended for several days

continuously the boring operations at Cleongart. These services the Com-
mittee feel they cannot overestimate, and in other respects also Mr. Gray
did much to assist the Committee in their work.

IV. Detailed Examination of the Shell-hearing Deposits by the Committee.

   --Tangy Glen. The lower part of this glen forms, for a distance of

about half a mile, a deep rocky gorge carved out of mica-schist.
Further up the glen the shelly clay appears on the left or south bank of
the stream, overlaid by boulder-clay. During th(i visit of the Committee
         ON THE SHELL-BEARING DEPOSITS IN KINTYRE.  381

it was observed that the section described by Dr. Robertson in 187 3 had
become overgrown with herbage and bushes, and was also partly concealed
by a low breast wall. Several artificial cuttings were made on the face of
the bank, and samples of the clay were taken for examination. The

observations of the Committee, so far as they went, confirmed those of

Messrs. Robertson and Crosskey in the paper referred to.
     The shelly clay is a stiflf, fine, bluish grey clay, upwards of 5 feet of

the deposit being laid bare. The upper portion seemed to be afiected by
exposure to the weather, and the darkish-blue colour was chietiy apparent
in the lower part. About 30 feet of reddish boulder-clay with numerous
boulders lie above the shelly clay, rising to a greater height further back

from the stream.

    At this point there is evidence of land-slips on the face of the bank,

so that the two deposits are sometimes intermingled.
     The top of the shelly clay as exposed in the trench made by the Com-

mittee was found by Mr. Eraser, C.E., to be 135^ feet above the level of

--the sea.
     Drimiore Glen. The lower part of this glen shows prominent cliffs
of red sandstone (Upper Old Red Sandstone), the strata dipping at angles
of about 8° down stream. Overlying the sandstone is a considerable

thickness of grey boulder-clay, full of boulders of crystalline schists.

The sides of the glen are in some places masked by the boulder-clay
slipping down over them. Resting apparently on the sandstone, however,
and under the boulder- clay, there are occasional patches of gravel and sand
and brown sandy clay, in the upper part of which some shells and shelly

fragments have been found.
     The ti ip of the brown shelly clay here was found by Mr. Fraser to be

199 feet above the level of the sea.

   --Cleongart Burn. As this is the most important section of shelly

clay hitherto observed in Kintyre, the Committee confined their detailed

observations chiefly to it.

    As in Drumore, the lower part of the glen is occupied by red sand-

stone (Upper Old Red), which in places forms prominent cliffs, rising to a

height of 20 feet or 30 feet. The sandstone is nearly horizontal, or inclined
westwards at an angle of 8° to 10°, resting unconformably on the crystal-

line schists.

     About 44 yards eastwards from the unconformable junction of the red
sandstone and the schist visible in the bed of the stream, the main section of
the shelly clay occurs on the south bank of the Burn, whei'e it is overlaid by

a great thickness of boulder-clay. The shelly clay is a stiff, dark, bluish

clay, comparatively free from stones in the upper part, though here and

Anthere throughout the section well-rounded stones are met with.  ex-

amination of the included blocks, the average size of which varies from

1 inch to 3 inches across, shows that they are chiefly of local origin,

being composed mainly of mica-schist with granular quartz- schist, and

hornblende-schist. No fragment of red sandstone was observed in this
deposit in the main section. No striations were observed on any of the

stones.

Shells were found in abundance during the first visit of the Committee

in 1895, a feature which was probably due to long exposure of the mate-

rials to the action of the weather, and the removal of the clay from the

surface by the rain.
--382 REPORT 1896.

   --Some of the species were particularly abundant as, for example,

Turritella, Cyprina, Astarte, Leda, &,c. Many were in excellent preser-

vation, but others were broken and fragmentary. Some of the smallest
shells, Ledas and others, were entire.

     The lower part of the shelly clay near the level of the stream being
concealed by a talus, the Committee resolved to cut a trench to show a
vertical section of the deposits down to the level of the stream. The
clay was found to rest upon a bed of compact coarse sand and gravel,
cut open to a depth of 3 feet 10 inches, no shell fragments being visible.
The boundary between the compact shelly clay above and the sand and
gravel below was sharply defined, and to all appearance horizontal. Fine

shelly mud immediately overlay the sand and gravel. Higher up, the

clay contained abundance of shells and a very few small water- worn
stones ; one stone, the largest found in the trench, appeared to be finely

striated.

     Owing to the percolation of water from the stream, the cutting was
not continued downward to the solid rock ; but the mica-schist is visible
in the bed of the Burn a few yards further down or west of the main

section.

    As will be seen from the section (fig. 2), the visible thickness of shelly

clay, resting on coarse sand and gravel, is 27^ feet ; and the thick-
ness of boulder-clay to the top of the bank is 74 feet.

      This overlying boulder-clay is of a reddish-brown colour, charged
abundantly with boulders, some of which are striated. These consist
mainly of crystalline schists of local origin, with a marked absence of

fragments of red sandstone. Though boulders of Arran granite were not
observed in the boulder-clay of the main section, they occur in considerable
numbers in the immediate neighbourhood, both on the surface and in the

agi'ound-moraine.

     The shelly clay is also visible at one or two points on the north bank
of the Cleongart Burn, where it is in like manner overlaid by reddish-
brown boulder-clay. It has not proved so fossiliferous there as in the
section on the southern bank which has just been described, but a few
shells have been found in it.

     With the view of proving the extension of the shelly clay along the
stream course in an easterly direction, the Committee put down a series

of shallow bores as represented in the accompanying ground-plan (fig. 3).'
Blue clay, resembling the shelly clay, was recognised in the samples
obtained from the three bores Nos. 1, 2, and 3, 22 yards, 44 yards, and
66 yards respectively east of the main section.

    No shells or other organic remains, except one or two fresh-water

Foraminifera, were found in the materials from these bores.

   A small exposure of a similar clay was visible still further east, or

88 yards distant from the main section. This contained some small frag-
ments of shells, and a few Ostracoda and Foraminifera.

     Seeing that the shelly clay had been found in each of these three glens
at nearly the same elevation, the Committee next considered it of im-
portance to test its extension southward from Cleongart, in the direction
of Drumore Glen. For this purpose a trench was first cut along the top
of the shelly clay in the main section at Cleongart, extending for about

     ' These shallow bores were about 10 feet above the level of the stream, and
respectively 23, 21, and 34 feet back from it.

8 feet undei" the boulder-clay of the south bank. The shelly clay was

found to continue in a nearly horizontal position as far as the cutting
was carried. It was then deemed advisable to sink bores farther back,

in the bank and at the top of it, for the purpose of ascertaining whether

the shelly clay still continued in that direction under the boulder-clay.

Two points were accordingly marked off, one being in the slope, and the

other four yards into the held above, the horizontal distances being

respectively 34 and 54 yards from the top of the exposed face of the

shelly clay (see sketch-plan of ground, fig. 3, and section, fig. 2).

    Work was begun first at the bore in the slope, 34 yards distant

horizontally, from the top of the exposed face of shelly clay. Here it

was estimated that the shelly clay, if it extended so far horizontally,

might be met with at a depth of 46 feet from the surface. The boring
through the stiff', stony, boulder- clay was attended with considerable
difficulties. At the depth of 45 feet, however, the borers actually reached
the shelly clay, and after passing downward through 10 feet of it, they
struck upon a rock or boulder which arrested their pi'ogress. The Com-

mittee did not think that they had reached the bottom of the shelly clay.

If this were the case, it would seem to show that the deposit was rapidly

thinning out, and might be met with only sparingly, if at all, farther

back. Till this point was tested, the Committee considered it unnecessary

to make any detailed examination of the clay from this bore, it being chieffy

important to examine it at the most distant locality where it should be

found.

They therefore transferred operations to the upper station, which

had been marked off' at the top of the south bank. Here, after a good
many difficulties and delays, the shelly clay was struck at a depth of

76 feet from the surface, which also corresponded very well with the

estimate that had been made beforehand. Mr. Gray was by this time

fortunately able to be with the borers, and give them the benefit of his
direction and supervision, and also to mark and lay aside samples of the

clay from various depths, which were sent on to Dr. Robertson for

examination (see Section VI., Dr. Robertson's Report). The clay was

found to continue downwards, with some variations in colour and com-

po.sition, for a depth of about 20 feet from the point where first met

Awith.  good many Ostracoda and Foraminifera were found in it by Dr.

Robertson, and a few fragments of shells. The bore was sunk to a

depth of 97 feet, the deposit becoming very stony towards the bottom',

and finally resembling the hard, compact gravel underlying the shelly clay

in the main section. The thickness of the shelly clay here met with

seemed to confirm the conclusion of the Committee that the bottom of

the deposit had not been reached in the first bore.
     The Committee regard the proved extension of the shelly clay thus far,

under the boulder-clay, as a point of much interest, and as favouring the
conclusion that it may extend more or less continuously, about the same
level, from one glen to another. They were desirous of putting down
another bore, still further south, to test or confirm this conclusion. But
the surface of the ground here consists of great mounds and ridges of

boulder- clay, which would render boring operations in that direction
tedious and costly, as well as uncertain ; and their available means
being l^y this time more than exhausted, they were obliged to stop,

and can only state the result of these operations, so far as they have

gone.

                V. Direction of Ice-jiow in Kintyre.

The direction of the ice-flow in Kintyre is of great importance in
Ai-elation to the investigations referred to the Committee.
                                                                list of localities

where striations were observed, based on observations made by Mr. Symes

in the course of the geological survey, is here given with the sanction of

the Director-General. With the view of presenting these observations in a

cleai-er form, they have prepared a map (tig. 4) of the district extending

from West Loch Tarbert in the north to the Mull of Kintyre in the south.

The observations of Mr. Symes have clearly demonstrated that Kintyre

has been glaciated by ice which crossed the peninsula in a westerly direc-
Ation from the Firth of Clyde to the Atlantic.
                                                 glance at the appended

list and stri;e map will show that the average direction in tlie neighbour-
hood of West Loch Tarbert is W. 20° S. Proceeding southwards along

the watershed between Carradale on the east coast and Cleongart and

Drumore on the west, many of the strife point due W., while some

instances trend W. 10°-20° S. Along the transverse hollow at Camp-
belton the direction varies from W. to W. 20° N. In that portion of

the peninsula lying to the south and south-west of Campbelton the trend

is variable  :  along the east coast  it varies  from W. to S.  25° W.                             in the
                                                                                                ;

Cannie Glen from W. 20° N. to W. 43° S. ; while near the west coast it

W.is .5° N". It is oljvious therefore that throughout Kintyre there must

have been a powerful deflection of the ice which enabled it to cross the

watershed, ranging in height from 896 feet near West Loch Tarbert to

1,462 feet near the Mull of Kintyre.

occurrence of granite boulders derived from the mass in the north of Arran.
They are met with in the boulder-clay and on the surface of the ground
throughout the peninsula from the Mull of Kintyre to a point several

miles noi'th of Carradale Bay. Mr. Synies has noted many examples in
the course of his survey of the region, and the members of the Committee
who visited Kintyre likewise recorded several instances. The determina-

tion of the northern limit of Arran granite boulders is a point of con-

siderable interest in relation to the extent of the deflection of the ice

across the peninsula. With the view of obtaining evidence on this question
the Secretary of the Committee paid a special visit to Carradale Bay and
traced the boulders northwards to Grogport, on the east coast. Mr. B. N.

Peach, F.R.S., has noted erratics of quartz-felsite, resembling the quartz-

felsite or trachyte of Drumadoon in Arran.
     Reference may also be made to the fact that along the west coast

between Cleongart and Tangy Glen, where a narrow belt of Upper Old

Red Sandstone, resting unconformably on the crystalline schists, fringes

the coast, no fragments of red sandstone derived from this patch have

been observed in the boulder- clay to the east, while blocks of the local
crystalline schists have been carried westwards on to the area occupied by

the Upper Old Red Sandstone.

        VI. Report hy Dr. David Robertson, F.G.S., F.L.S.,
               Mem. Imp. Roy. Zool. Botan. Soc, Vienna.

In the preparation of the clays for taking the percentage of mud, sand,

and gravel of the diflerent deposits, the term ' mud ' is that which passes

through a sieve     of  ninety-six meshes to  the  inch                         'sand'   is  that which
                                                                             ;

passes  through  a  sieve of  twenty-four  meshes to  the                       inch  ;  ' gravel                             is  that
                                                                                                                           '

which is retained   in  the same sieve of  twenty-four                          meshes   to  the                              inch
                                                                                                                                               ;

and ' floats ' is that which is gathered on the surface of the water when

the dry clay is put in and stirred up.
     I have all the materials parcelled separately, except the muds, which

passed away in the washing. I have samples of the sand in small bottles,
so that each sample can be compared with the others. The stones and

gravels are parcelled up for the same purpose.

     The gravels are mostly water- worn ; some are angular, the proportions

differing more or less in different samples. No striations were noticed on
the stones, large or small, with the exception of one stone sent me by

Mr. Gray, 2 lb. weight, which is well striated on the line of the longest

axis on the under side, and obliquely on the upper. It seems possible,

however, that this stone may have got into the shelly clay from the

adjoining boulder-clay above.

    On our visit to the Cleongart deposit, no whole shells with their valves

together could be seen, except one or two of the very smallest. This

may be very well accounted for. Our friend, Mr. Gray, the discoverer

of this shelly deposit some years ago, had made several visits to the place,

and had gathered nearly all the shells worth taking that weathering had

exposed, probably for a long time past. These are now to be seen in
the Campbelton Museum. Although fragments of shells are still found

thickly strewn over the bank, they are but sparsely met with in the dark

blue clay underneath. This also may be explained by the action of

weathering.
--390 REPORT 1896.

The most remarkable feature of this deposit is the condition of the

shells of Cyprina islandica, Turritella terehra, and Fuaus contrarius. In

the case of C. islandica, which is plentiful in the deposit, it is remarkable

that they are all excessively fractured, not through the thinnest portions
only, but across the thickest parts of the shell. This is all the more sur-

prising, as there is no visible striation, aqueous action, or abrasion on the
fragments of the shells that would account for such destruction. The

late  Dr. Jeffreys stated  :         ' In a post-glacial or raised beach at Golspie,
                                  '

Sutherlandshire, close to high-water mark, I noticed that valves were

heaped up in extraordinary confusion, generally in fragments. ... I was

told by Mr. Bean, that on pouring boiling water on the living shells

(C. islandica) a succession of reports ensued as if a volley had been fired.
. . . The action of severe frost at the period when the climate and other
conditions resembled those of polar regions, might have had the same

effect on the shells.' It seems probable that if great heat does splinter

the shells, intense frost may do the same. On the other hand, it may be

stated that while dredging in the yacht ' Medusa,' in seventy to eighty

fathoms, between Brodick and Little Cuml)rae, fragments were frequently

brought up of C. islandica with the fractured edge quite sharp, and

.showing no rubbing or marks of striation. Whatever the cause may

be, it does not seem to be of frequent occurrence in other post-tertiary

deposits. In all the Clyde beds that I haA'e examined, the species is

generally moderately common, and a broken valve is quite exceptional.

      Turritella terebra is another shell that has suffered a great amount

of breakage. It is the prevailing shell of the deposit, occurring in great

abundance, yet I did not see one perfect specimen. They do not seem

to have undergone the same kind of treatment in the breakage as

C. islandica, having been chiefly, or all, broken transversely at the groove

between the whorls, the whorls themselves having nearly all escaped

injury. Seeing the great destruction of C. islandica in the same deposit,

it is difficult to conceive how the prominent whorls of T. terehra were not

crushed in the same way.

Fusus contrarius is remarkable, being sinistral, which is very rare in

our present seas. They are common in the English Crag, but this is the

only occurrence I know of having been i^ecorded in British Post-

Tertiaries.

     Stones mostly water- worn, some angular ; no striations observed. This

shows a much higher percentage of mud, and a smaller percentage of
gravel and sand than the above, which may be accounted for by much of
the fine mud and sand being washed away from the overlying weathered
surface clay, and a portion of the stones slipping down from tlie higher

boulder-clay and mixing with the surface shelly clay.

                                    Remarks.

In some of the parcels from these various depths the gravel was

Amostly angular in others, more or less water-worn.  good deal of it

might be called a coarse sand, but some of the stones were about the size

of ordinary gooseberries. No striation was observed on any of them.

By whatever means the shelly clay was laid down, it will be seen from

the following Table that there had been at least three distinct changes

in the deposition of the sediment. In the lowest division, including the

depths 97 up to 94, the dry clay was of a light brown colour, friable and

easily broken. In the next section, including depths 92 feet 9 inches up

to 87 feet, the dry clay was of a dark bluish slate colour, hard and diffi-

cult to break. The uppermost section, including depths 85 to 76 feet,

when dry, was of a light brown The clay from 76 down to 79| feet was

hard, and disintegrated slowly from 80 to 85 feet it was less hard, and

disintegrated more freely.

It is not without interest to note the variations of the colours and

hardness of the clays as they ; ire built uj) one above another, as well as

the number of species of the                  the different zones, together

with their living distribution.

There are three species of Foraminifera in this deposit that have not

been found in Recent deposits in the British Isles, viz., Discorbina 2)oly-

stomelloides, Pohjstomella macella, and Rotalia orbicularis. All three in

the fossil state are, so far as I know, only found in Scotland in the

shelly clay deposits of Kintyre, not rarely but frequently ; and I may

say that Rotalia orhictdaris is a prevailing species in the deposit.

      Their southern widely distributed living habitats are (1) Discorbina

polystomelloides, at three different stations among the islands south of

New Guinea, namely, off Booby Island in 6 to 8 fathoms, off "Wednesday

Island and Flinders' Passage, and the Australian coral reefs.

     (2) Polysfomella macella, northern temperate zone, the Mediterranean

and Adriatic being apparently its northern limit. As fossil it has been

certain species of Foraminifera, characteristic of warm-temperate and

                                             VII. Conclusion.

      In presenting this report on the shell-bearing deposits of Kintyre, the
members of the Committee have endeavoured to give an impartial state-
ment of the evidence bearing on the nature of these deposits ; leaving

those interested in the question of their origin to draw their own conclu-

sions from the ascertained facts.
     The Committee have again had the great benefit of Dr. David

Robertson's co-operation in examining the samples of clay taken from the
sections and the borings. This he has done with all his wonted care and

minuteness, and the value of his Report will be appreciated by all who

are interested in these researches.

    Mr. P. F. Kendall, another member of Committee, also examined a
parcel of the shelly clay from the main section at Cleongart, and his

observations so far corresponded with those of Dr. Robertson.

     The maps and section exhibited to the Geological Section were care-
fully prepared by Mr. Fraser, C.E., of Inverness, from measurements
taken by him during a visit to the locality in the summer of the present

year.

This Committee was appointed with the object of clearing up certain

doubtful points as to the relation of Palfeolithic man to the Glacial epoch.

Hoxne, on the borders of Norfolk and Suffolk, was selected as the best

locality for the investigation, for Palseolithic implements and various

fossiliferous strata were there known to occur in close proximity to

undisturbed Boulder Clay, and it was probable that a single excavation

Awould be sufficient to decide several of the disputed questions.  few

words as to previous investigations will explain the state of our know-

ledge when the Committee commenced work.

                                                Previous Observers.

      John Frere, in 1797, recorded in a letter the occurrence of abundant
 Palfeolithic implements.' These seem to have been obtained from the
northern end of the pit, now abandoned and overgrown with oak-trees
apparently about ninety years old. Implements seem to have been more
plentiful there than in the part now worked, for Frere speaks of the
occurrence ' at the rate of five or six in a square yard.' One in about ten

square yards is nearer the rate at the present day.

     Mr. John Evans was the lirst of late years to call attention to Frere's
discoveries, and he visited Hoxne with Mr. Prestwich. They sank some

pits in 1859.^

      In 1860 and 1864 Professor Prestwich published descriptions of the
strata at Hoxne, showing that certain beds with leaves and freshwater
shells underlay the Palpeolithic deposits, and that these lacustrine strata
rested on Boulder Clay."*

     Thomas Belt subsequently (in 1876) tried to prove the interglacial age of
the implement-bearing loams, laying special stress on the occurrence in the
pit in Oakley Park of a small patch of Chalky Boulder Clay overlying

the loam."*

   A year or two later Mr. H. B. Woodward and Mr. Clement Reid

examined a new cut made to drain the brickyard into Gold Brook, and
saw Palieolithic deposits resting on Chalky Boulder Clay.

     In 1888 Mr. Clement Reid and Mr. H. JST. Ridley found that the
patch of Boulder Clay noticed by Belt above the Paleolithic deposits was

merely the remains of some clay brought to the pit, and that this Boulder
Clay distinctly rested in one place on the recent vegetable soil. They also
discovered numerous Arctic plants in the clays, but were unable to ascer-
tain the exact relations of the deposits, for the pit was full of water.'
They returned, therefore, in 1895, and made a series of borings, which
pointed to a succession like that now demonstrated ; but, as the results
were not conclusive, the manuscript notes '^ were reserved for incorpora-

tion in this Report.

       Field Work.

The Committee hoped to commence work at Hoxne immediately after

the close of the Ipswich meeting ; but unexpected difficulty was met with
in obtaining permission to make the excavations, so that the most favour-

able season was thus lost. Nothing could be done during the winter

but as soon as the days became longer and the weather more propitious,

renewed application was made, and Mr. Stafford, on behalf of the

owners, immediately granted the necessary facilities. On March 23 Mr.

Clement Reid went to Hoxne, and remained in charge of the work

throughout, Mr. E. P. Ridley, of Ipswich, visiting the place twice during

the ten days. During these days a pit was sunk in the brickyard to a

depth of 20 feet, and a boring from the bottom of this pit was carried

22 feet lower, till the glacial sands were reached. The Section obtained,

and the large samples of the strata taken to London for examination,

proved of so great interest that it was thought desirable to complete the

investigation by continuing the chain of borings right across the old basin

or channel. Permission to bore in Oakley Park was at once given by Mr.

Hay, the tenant of the estate, and an application was made by Sir John

Evans and Sir Archibald Geikie to the Royal Society, which granted an

additional sum of 30^. With this grant stronger boring tools were hired

from Messrs. Le Grand and SutclifF, and work was recommenced on May 6,

Mr. Reid again taking charge for the fortnight that it lasted. Twelve

additional borings were made, and as nine of these reached the base of the

lacustrine deposits, we have now sufficient evidence to draw an accurate

·Section across the ancient silted-up channel (see Plate).

Having the experience of 1888 and 1895 to guide them, they were able

at once to select the spot where the buried channel was probably deepest,

and where each of the deposits contained in it was fossiliferous. The site

(BHselected had, in fact, one of the trial borings of 1895      2) at its

southern end, and it was within 3 or 4 yards of the flooded pit out of

which the Arctic plants discovered in 1888 had been thrown. The length

of the hole was 23^ feet, and the breadth nearly 4 feet, the intention being

to work the clay in steps, as the men are accustomed to do. It was found,

however, that the lacustrine deposits were considerably thicker than had

lieen estimated, so after a time the hole was reduced to a vertical shaft,

the material and water being removed by a well-sinker's tub and windlass.
The Section (fig. 1) will explain the mode of work. The principal, in

fact the only real, difficulty met with was due to a spring flowing from the

gravel at the south end of the pit. This necessitated constant attention
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

a sump was made to prevent the lower working being flooded, and the

water was baled out from this sump. The lower part of the pit yielded

little water, but the spring above filled the pit to within 5 feet of the

therefore decided to give up sinking and to bore to the base of the lacustrine

4Hclay. This was reached at a depth of  feet from the present surface

i.e. about 51 feet from the old surface before the brickyard was worked.

Directly the auger penetrated the clay and sank into the sand below,

water rose so as to stop work ; there was no need, however, to Ijore fur-

ther, as the doubtful points were already settled.

As the work progressed large samples were selected from each fossili-

ferous bed for further examination, and to prevent any chance of mixture

the boxes from Bed C were nailed up and sent away before the lignite

below was disturbed. These samples have been minutely examined and

washed for fossils in London, Miss Morse undertaking part of Bed C, and

Mr. Reid superintending the washing of the others.

As Boulder Clay was the only deposit met with in the borings, and

not seen in the trial-hole, there is no necessity here to describe each
boring in detail ; the particulars will be found in the Appendix, and the

position of each is marked on the Map and Section. Suffice it here to say

that they show clearly the contour of the ancient channel, prove that it
is narrow, and excavated through glacial deposits, and show that the
Chalky Boulder Clay (the latest Boulder Clay of Suffolk) lies beneath all
of the lacustrine deposits. The chain of borings was carried approxi-
mately east and west, so as to cross the old channel nearly at right angles.

A few borings out of the line of section seem to indicate that the channel

runs nearly north and south. It was out of the question to trace out the
course of the channel, for it makes no sign at the surface, and to follow
it would need a multitude of borings, most of which would be of little or

no interest.

     This is the only deposit usually exposed in the brickyard, and from it
the Palajolithic implements (see fig. 3) are obtained. Hoxne Brickyard
for many years seems to have been worked mainly for this upper brick-
earth, from which are made the red bricks. It thus happens that over an

Aextensive area nearly the whole of Bed has been removed, and the

sides of the pit are so overgrown that it is difficult to obtain detailed
measurements. There are clear sections, however, on the opposite side of

the road in the new pit in Oakley Park where this brickearth is now worked

living within a few miles of Hoxne. The mammals are widely migrating

The borings show that the fossiliferous Palaeolithic brickearth when

traced westward overlaps the other fluviatile deposits, to rest at last imme-

diately on Boulder Clay. They indicate also that the laminated brick-

earth entirely disappears about the middle of Oakley Park, where it

There is commonly to be found at the base of the Palseolithic brick-

earth a seam of fine gravel mixed with vegetable matter. This gravel

was 2 or 3 feet thick in our trial pit, but it contained neither imple-

ments nor fossils. As, however, it yielded a small worked flake in one of

our trial borings (BH 1 of 1895), it deserves separate notice, especially

as Frere appears to have obtained his implements from this gravel, and not

Afrom the brickearth above.  good implement found in 1877 by Messrs.

"H. B. Woodward and Clement Reid, at the east side of the brickyard,

seemed also to have come from this horizon.

                             BedC.

Immediately beneath the Palaeolithic deposits is found the 'black

earth ' of the brickmakers, though the term is also sometimes applied to

carbonaceous parts of the upper deposit. This black earth has only been

partly dug over the area already worked for Bed A. It is used for white

bricks, which are less in demand than the red ones, and as the pits

become flooded when digging ceases sections are seldom visible.

In the trial-pit this black earth was found to be 13 feet in thickness.

It consists of alternating thin layers of carbonaceous loam, sand, and

vegetable matter, sand and small clay-pebbles becoming very abundant in

the lower part. Vegetable remains, such as decayed leaves, twigs, and

seams of moss, are so abundant as to render the loam fissile throughout.

Scattered freshwater shells occur, though not in great numbers or in much

variety. Fish bones also occur ; but no trace of large mammalia was
found, and the workmen state that they have never come across any

bones below Bed A. The distal end of a small indeterminable mammalian

femur was obtained on washing some of the material.

The leaves so abundant in Bed C always belong to three species of

dwarf Arctic willow, or, more rarely, to the dwarf Arctic birch. The

twigs and stems retaining their bark also belong evidently to the same

species. Though fragments of larger wood occur, these are always worn,

without bark, and have probably been dei'ived from the destruction of
ABeds D and E.
                single waterworn nut of the hornbeam and one or

two broken seeds of yew must be placed in the same category, and several

other plants, only represented by woody seeds confined to the gravelly

lower part of the deposit, are also in all probability only present as deri-

vatives from the breaking up of the older deposits. An attempt has been

clay-gravel which undoubtedly contain derivative fossils. It will imme-

diately occur to any botanist looking at the list that several of the

plants, besides those marked as derivative, are species not likely to have
lived with the dwarf Arctic willows and birch. But as we wish to use the

list for the determination of the climatic conditions which reigned when

the deposit was being formed, it is clear that we have no right first to

reject certain species that seem to contradict the other evidence, and then

Weto argue as though we weie dealing with a homogeneous flora.  can

say, however, that the fragile specimens, such as leaves, moss, and delicate

seeds, which cannot have been washed out of an older deposit, all represent

a homogeneous Arctic or high alpine flora. Trees, with the possible ex-

ception of the alder, seem to have been entirely absent, and the climate

was probably not unlike that of the cold treeless regions of North

America and Siberia.

Though so lai'ge a quantity of material was removed in oui' trial-pit,

the number of leaves obtained in good preservation was not great ; we
obtained, in fact, fewer good specimens than in 1888. The reason of the

decay of the leaves must be sought in the fact that we struck the centre

of the old channel, where the deposits are exceptionally sandy, and the

Wecirculation of the water is greatest.   were able to preserve only the

smaller tough leaves of Salix myrsinites, though larger decayed ones are

not uncommon. Of Bettda nana we have not been able to save a single

fragment, although leaves were seen on splitting the wet loam. The

     The 1888 list adds the following species, though we cannot be per-

fectly sure that they are all from Bed C. They also were determined by

Mr. Mitten :--

lirachythecium rutabulum, Bruoli and                                                                     Webera albicans, Sclnmp.

Acroceratium cuspidatum, 3Iitt.

     The animal remains associated with these plants are very few. They
include only a small indeterminable mammalian bone, some Ostracoda, a
few laeetles, among which Mr. Waterhouse finds Hylesinus fraxini?^
some small galls, and six species of freshwater mollusca :

    No implements have yet been found in Bed C ; but as the pits are in

the centre of the channel or lake, and no stone over an inch in diameter
was seen, negative evidence is of little value till the margin and gravelly
deposits of the same age have been searched.

                                                Bed D.

     The character of the deposit changes suddenly immediately beneath the
lowest seam containing Arctic willows, though the abruptness of the change
is somewhat masked by the inclusion of derived material in the newer

strata. Bed C rests on a mass of lignite from 1 to 3 feet in thickness.

This lignite, at the spot where the trial-pit was sunk, evidently repre-

--sents an ancient alder-carr growing in the old channel just as alder-

carrs now grow on the marsh-lands throughout the eastern counties. The

bulk of the deposit is composed of alder-wood, retaining its bark, but
more or less decayed, mingled with cones, seeds, and leaves of the same
tree. The lignite contains also other seeds in profusion, but nearly all
belong to a few swamp-loving plants, such as are usually to be found in
an alder-carr, or in the pools or sluggish channels that intersect it.
There is little or no drifted material, and the few plants that did not live
on the spot are, with the exception of the hornbeam, berry-bearing
species, the fruits of which are habitually dispersed far and wide by birds.
Even the winged seeds of the thistle and dandelion, usually to be found
iu ancient alluvial deposits, are missing, and we have an extremely

restricted flora, every member of which, however, grew in all probability
within a few yards of the place where it is now found. The whole of the
thirty-seven species of flowering plants now determined are still living in

the county.

   A few Valvata piscinalis, a Pisidinm, one or two indeterminable fish-

bones, and some elytra of beetles are the only animal remains yet met
with in the lignite. Mr. Waterhouse observes among the elytra some

The oak wood obtained by Professor Prestwich from the workmen

may belong to this horizon, though none was met with in the trial-pit.
The piece of pine-bark and the seed of cornel, found among disturbed
material in 1888 by Messrs. Reid and Ridley, may both belong to recent

specimens; these species therefore should not be included in the list without

Afurther corroboration.  pit sunk at the margin instead of in the centre

of the channel would probably yield many more dry-soil species, and

might also yield traces of man.

    Mr. Mitten records the following mosses from this horizon, and it may

be observed that the conclusions he comes to with regard to the climatic

Dand other conditions under which Beds C and were deposited agree

closely with those arrived at from an examination of the flowering

plants :

                                               Bed E.

     The lignite just described rests on a mass of green carbonaceous clay
with lacustrine shells, fish-remains, and a few drifted seeds belonging to
the same plants as occur in the bed above. This clay is not used in the
brickyard ; but our trial-pit was sunk about a foot into it, and then a
boring was carried to its base. The upper part of the clay is green, hard,
                                --

and tough, so that it breaks under the spade instead of cutting ; below it
becomes rather softer and more carbonaceous ; at its base it contains an

admixture of sand derived from the Glacial or Crag beds beneath. This clay

is a most unmanageable deposit from which to obtain fossils. It does not

show any tendency  to go  to pieces  in water,  even after  thorough  drying
                                                                                                      ;

and long-continued boiling with soda does not help to disintegrate it. It

seems to contain an admixture of animal matter, for in the flame it gives

o& smoke and smells strongly. The intractable nature of the matrix

made it only possible to obtain the fossils by breaking the clay, and thus

many of the seeds were destroyed or rendered indeterminable. The fossils

obtained from this clay were :

                                                Boidder Clay.

    The Boulder Clay at Hoxne calls for no special remark. It is a tough

mass principally composed of Jurassic clay and fragments of Chalk, with
scattered flints, septaria, and, more rarely, older rocks. Nearly all the
stones are striated. This clay is in fact pait of the extensive sheet of
Chalky Boulder Clay which covers so large a part of our eastern counties.
It can be well seen in the Clay-pit on the east side of Gold Brook, near
the Brickyard (see Map, fig. 2).

                                               Glacial Sand.

     The sand beneath the Boulder Clay was reached at a depth of 24 feet

in a boring (BH 9) put down in the Clay-pit just mentioned as occurring

east of the Brickyard. Sand, apparently of the same age, was again met

with in (BH 11) and in the boring (BH 8) made at the bottom of our

trial-pit, where the Boulder Clay seems entirely to have been cut through
before the lacustrine deposits were laid down. In this latter case, however,

it is possible that Crag may have been reached, for the sandy base of Bed

E was full of small derivative valves of Balanus such as are so abundant

in the Norwich Crag.

                                                       Conclusions.

     The facts gathered in the course of this inquiry enable us partly to
trace the history of this old buried river-channel. It seems never to have
been a channel of much importance, but more probably the valley of a
small tributary stream than that of a river. Its history seems to have been

--as follows : After the disappearance of the ice which deposited the Chalky

higher than at present, so that the Hoxne channel cuuld Ijc excavated to
a depth slightly below that of the present main c-hannel of the river
Waveney. Then gradual subsidence turned this channel into a shallow

freshwater lake, in which 20 feet of the lacustrine clay E was deposited.

After the lake had silted up it was overgrown by a dense thicket of alders,
which by their decay formed the lignite D, containing a Temperate flora
like that of bed E. Next a further slight suljsidence, or perhaps an
irregular silting up of the lower part of the channel, caused lacustrine
conditions to reappear, and another 20 feet of lacustrine strata (C) to be

--deposited but the climate had again become colder in fact it was now
                                                                          ;

an Arctic or sub- Arctic one. Then followed the floods which deposited the

Palaeolithic Beds B and A, only parts of which seem to be truly fluviatile;

--and finally the strata became sandy and perhaps of eolian origin. To

summarise : The channel after being scoured to a depth equal to that of
the existing valley of the Waveney, and considerably below that of its
existing tributaries, the river Dove and Gold Brook, was filled up with
fully 50 feet of sediment. It was in fact so completely filled that the
streams have since taken quite different courses, and we cannot identify
the Pleistocene channel as belonging to any existing valley.

     During the excavation and silting up of the channel the cliinatic con-
ditions seem to have changed at least twice. Of the nature of the transi-
tion from the Arctic conditions indicated by the Boulder Clay to the mild

DEperiod represented by the lacustrine clay and the lignite we have at

present no evidence. But of the existence of a mild period subsequent
to the formation of the Chalky Boulder Clay and previous to the reappear-
ance of Arctic conditions, we can now produce sufficient evidence in the long

Dlist of Temperate plants found in Beds and E. The Pahieolithic deposits

at Hoxne are therefore not only later than the latest Boulder Clay of
East Anglia, but are separated from it by two climatic waves, with

corresponding changes of the flora. Such sweeping changes cannot have
been local ; they must have affected wide areas.

     It may perhaj^s be advisable before concluding to guard ourselves

against any misapprehension as to the exact outcome of this inquiry. It

is true that the evidence is now perfectly clear that the well-known Palaeo-
lithic implements of Hoxne are much later than the Boulder Clay of that
district. But it by no means follows that man did not live in the district

Dwhile the Arctic leaf-bed C or the lacustrine strata and E were being

deposited, though no implements (or stones of any sort over an inch in

diameter) were found in them. It is possible that in other districts man
may be inter- Glacial or pre-Glacial, but on this question the Hoxne exca-
vations throw no light ; they only show that a race of men using imple-
ments of the Hoxne type certainly inhabited Suffolk long after the latest

glaciation of that district. Whether precisely the same form of imple-
ment is likely to have been in use in Britain in both pre-Glacial and post-
(ilacial times is a question into which we need not enter.

    Garwood (Secretary), and Mr. A. H. Poord, appointed to study

     the Life-zones in the British Garhoniferous Rods. (Drawn up hij

     Mr. Garwood.)

Ix a paper read before the British Association at Ipswich, in 1895, two

of us called attention to the work of Dr. Waagen on the Upper Palaeozoic

rocks of the Salt Range, and gave reasons for supposing that the Car-
boniferous rocks of Britain might be divided into zones. ' In that paper
it was suggested ' that a Committee be appointed to inquire into the

possibility of dividing the Carboniferous rocks into zones, to call the
attention of local observers to the desirability of collecting fossils with
this view, and, if possible, to retain the services of eminent specialists to

whom these fossils may be submitted.' This Committee was appointed,

and the members thereof beg leave to submit their /eport.
     The Committee believe that the following districts would furnish

good results, and recommend that those whose names are appended to

the various districts be asked to take charge of their particular districts
and to endeavour to carry out therein the objects of the Committee :

     England and Wales : Northumberland and the Border, Professor
G. A. Lebour ; Northern part of Pennine chain and adjoining regions,
Messrs. Garwood and Marr ; Southern part of ditto and adjoining regions,
Mr. P. F. Kendall and Dr. Wheelton Hind ; North Wales, Mr. G. H.

     The Committee recommend that the following directions for working
be communicated to the various workers :

    1. When po.'ssible, a typical measured section should be given of each

locality examined, with notes of as many confirmatory sections as possible.
    2. Any specimen not actually found in situ, to be labelled to that

effect, with the exact conditions under which it was found noted.
     o. All specimens should be labelled with the local name of the bed,

wivino- as many additional details as possible, and in all cases the exact

locality, which should further be noted on a lai'ge-scale map.

      4. All specimens should be labelled luhen found.
     .5. So far as possible, workers are recommended to collect from one
bed at a time, and to pack the specimens from each bed in a separate
parcel before commencing to collect from another bed.
      6. Attention should be paid to apparently identical forms separated

by many feet or yards of deposit, as the forms may be mutations ; large

suites of such specimens should be collected ; indeed

     7. As large a number of specimens as possible should be obtained of

each species in every bed examined.
      8. Absence of fossils in any bed should be noted whenever possible.
     9. Attempts should be made to record the relative abundance of

fossils, which may be roughly done by recording those which are very
rare (v. r.), i-are (r.), common (c), and very common (v. c).

      10. In case of beds being obviously rich in micro-organisms, large

pieces should be collected for future examination.
      11. Considering the importance which cherts have assumed, it is very

desirable to collect specimens of cherts.

    Specimens may be kept by the discoverers or forwarded to the
Secretary of the Connnittee (E. J. Garwood, Drydeu Chambers, 119
Oxford Street, London, W.) on loan or for retention.

    The Committee recommend that the names of those whom they have

mentioned as likely to undertake the charge of districts be added to the

Committee, and that the following palaeontologists be asked to co-operate

with the other members, and to identify such fossils as may be submitted

--to them, their names being also added (when not previously mentioned) to

those of the Committee : Dr. G. J. Hinde (radiolaria and sponges). Pro-

fessor H. A. Nicholson (corals), Mr. J. W. Kirkby (entomostraca). Dr. H.
Woodward (other Crustacea), Mr. F. A. Bather (echinoderms and brachio-

pods), Dr. Wheelton Hind and Mr. E. J. Garwood (lamellibranchs and
gastropods), Messrs. G. C. Crick and A. H. Foord (cephalopods). Dr.

R. H. Traquair (fish), and Mr. R. Kidston (plants).
     The Committee i-ecommend that a grant of 151. be applied for in

order to pay for the services of collectors, who are to be under the direc-

tion of the Secretary of the Committee.

This Committee have now been at work for four years. It is difficult, how-
ever, to dissociate this work from the previous and the contemporaneous
work carried on by the Liverpool Marine Biology Committee. Conse-

quently it will probably best serve the interests of science if this final

report be made to include references to all the work that has been done
of recent years on the marine fauna and flora of the Irish Sea.

       HISTORICAL.

A good deal of exploring work in the Irish Sea has been done in the

past by Edward Forbes, McAndrew, Price, Byerley, Marrat, Moore, Hig-
gins, CoUingwood, and others ; but the more modern investigations date
from the formation of the Liverpool Marine Biology Committee in March

1885. After a year's work on the investigation of the fauna and flora of

Liverpool Bay and the neighbouring seas, the Committee published in
January 1886 the first volume of ' Reports upon the Fauna of Liverpool

Bay.' In this first volume they recorded all previous speciographic work
done in the district, and also the results of their own dredging and other

collecting expeditions, amounting in all to 013 species, of which 235 had

not been found before in the district (see fig. 1, p. 450).
     During the second year's work the Committee felt the need of a bio-

logical station near to one of their richer collecting grounds, and so the

Puflin Island Station was fitted up and opened in May 1 387. At the end

of that year the first annual report was issued under the title of ' The

Foundation and First Season's Work of the Liverpool Marine Biological

Station, Puffin Island.' From this time onwards an annual report on

the work of the L.M.B.C. has been published at the end of each year,

the ninth appearing in December 1895. The larger publications, the

--volumes of the 'Fauna,' have appeared at intervals of three years the

first in 1886, the second in 1889, the third in 1892, and the fourth in 1895.
The records in the second volume brought the number of known species

in the fauna up to 1,456, the third raised it to 1,685, and the fourth to
2,025. The total number to date is 2,133. Volume i. gives the record

of the investigations prior to the foundation of the biological station.

Volumes ii. and iii. record the observations made at Puffin Island ; while
volume iv. opens the account of the Port Erin Station.

In 1892 the Committee I'elinquished Puffin Island and built the new

Biological Station at a very much more convenient and richer locality,

Port Erin, at the south-west end of the Isle of Man. This establishment

was formally opened on June 4, 1892, by his Excellency Dr. Spencer

Walpole, Lieut.-Governor of the island. In the following year a second

--building-- the Aquarium was added, and since then the institution has

been constantly in use, and has pi'oved increasingly useful each season,
both to members of the Committee and to other naturalists. Since the
opening of the Port Erin Station, in 1892, fifty-six biologists have paid
over 200 longer or shorter visits for the purpose of woi-king at the marine
fauna and flora.

     The British Association Committee for the investigation of the Marine
Zoology, Botany, and Geology of the Irish Sea were appointed in 1892,
and three previous reports have been submitted. The first, laid befoi-e
the jSTottingham meeting in 1893, gave an account of the limits and more
prominent physical conditions of the area under investigation, with a brief
interim notice of the dredging expeditions undertaken during the year.
The second report, at the Oxford meeting in 1891, gave a fuller description
of the methods of work on one of the dredging expeditions, and also in-
cluded an account of the distribution of the submailne deposits of the
area, and a notice of the chief results of the year's work, including some
new species. The third report, given last year at Ipswich, dealt chiefly with
the submarine deposits, the investigation of the surface currents, and with
the distribution of animals as shown from dredging statistics. The pre-
vious reports have all been ^jrovisional only, and in none of them have
more than a few of the more prominent of the animals obtained been
mentioned. In this final report, consequently, we give for the first time
a complete list of all the species we have been able to record from our area
of the Irish Sea ; and to render this list more useful we append to each
name a brief reference to the volume and page of the report or paper in
which the species was recorded. First, however, we give a brief account
of the work of the past year, so as to complete the record of our collecting

expeditions.

                         THE YEAR'S WORK.

     Since September 1895 the Committee have organised eight dredging

expeditions, nearly all in steamers, as follows :

   --I. October 27, 1895. Hired steamer 'Rose Ann.' Localities dredged

--and trawled : off Port Erin and along S.E. side of Isle of Man, from

the Calf Sound to Langness, at depths of 15 to 20 fathoms.

   --II. November 21, 1895. Small boats. Localities dredged :--Port

Erin Bay, in depths up to 7 fathoms.

   --III. February 2, 1896. Hired steamer 'Rose Ann.' Localities dredged

--and trawled : through the Calf Sound, and off its eastern and western

ends, at depths of 16 to 20 fathoms.

     IV. March 14, 1896.--Sea Fisheries steamer 'John Fell.' Off Port

Erin,

   --V. April 5, 1896. Hired steamer 'Rose Ann.' Localities trawled :

out in the deep chamiel, 12 miles S.W. of Calf; bottom reamy mud, with

many spawning fish ; depths 40 to 50 fathoms.

   --VI. April21-24, 1896.--Sea Fisheries steamer 'John Fell.' Localities

trawled : deep channel, 12 miles S.W. of Calf, and further north to
opposite Port Erin ; also west of Dalby, 8 miles off ; reamy bottom ; depths
20 to 40 fathoms.

   --VIL May 29 and 30, 1896.-- Sea Fisheries steamer 'John Fell.'

 22 fathoms.

   --Two of these expeditions those at Easter in the ' Rose Ami, and at
--the end of April in the ' John Fell ' were particularly successful, and

resulted in the capture of a number of new and interesting species.
Amongst these is a large green Gephyrean worm, which is either Thalas-
sema gigas, M. Miiller, or a new species of Thalassema with a remarkable
pigment ; and a Cumacean, for which a new genus is necessary.

     Additions have been made during the year to most of the groups of
invertebrate animals, and these will be found noted in the lists below ·
but Mr. A. O. Walker has prepared the following special account of the

--higher Crustacea obtained on these expeditions :

     The following species of Crustacea Malacostraca have been added "
to the fauna since the last report. Nearly all were dredged off the S. end

of the Isle of Man in the ' John Fell ' expedition, from April 22 to 24

1896.

       CONCLUDING REMARKS.

Although tliis is put forward as a final report of the present Com-

mittee, they do not desire thereby to indicate that the work of exploring

the zoology, botany, and geology of the Irish Sea "is finished. Probably

such an investigation can never be finished ; but the Committee feel that

the occasion of the British Association meeting in Liverpool is one that

they ought to take advantage of to present a report which is final, in the

sense that it completes the present series of reports, and brings together

and sums up the results of all previous marine biological work in the

district (see figs. 1 and 2).

For the future, they hope that the work will be carried on actively by

the Liverpool Marine Biology Committee, the body of investigators by

whom most of the work has been done in the past. The Port Erin

Biological Station is equipped for such work, and the British Association
oan best render efiective help by supporting the general investigations

"Carried on at that station, or by giving grants for special researches.

    As may be seen from this and the preceding reports, the greater part

of the work of the Committee has been zoological ; botany, however, has

been represented by several investigators, and lists are given above of
the marine algse, including diatoms. Professor Weiss, a member of the

Committee, has commenced observations on the reproduction of diatoms,
and has collected much material for an investigation of the coralline

alga;, upon both of which he will report to the Liverpool Biological

Society during next session.

In regard to the geology of the sea-floor, Mr. Clement Reid considers

remarked upon the characteristics of the deposits ; he has all the material,

ox THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  451

--litrd Migration in Great Britain and Ireland. Report of the Com-

     mittee, consisting of Professor Newton (Ghaimian), Mr. John
     CoRDEAUx (Secretary), Mr. John A. Harvie-Brown, Mr. R. M.
    Barrington, Mr. W. Eagle Clarke, and Rev. E. P. Knubley,

      appointed for the jmrpose of inakiv/j a Digest of the Observations on
      the Migrations of Birds at Lighthouses and Lightvessels, 1880-1887.

Your Committee have at last the pleasure of reporting that the Digest
which they were appointed to make of the observations on the Migration of

Birds taken at Lighthouses and Lightvessels from 1880 to 1887 has been
completed, and of presenting the same to the Association.

     As has been before stated at meetings of the Association, this Digest
is the work of one of their number, and the remaining Members of the

Committee have to record their deep sense of the obligation under which
they lie to Mr. William Eagle Clarke, of the Science and Art Museum,
Edinburgh, for the assiduity with which he has so long laboured on the
enormous task he undertook, and to congratulate him on the success with

 which he has overcome the countless difficulties it presented.
      In these congratulations the Committee feel that they are entitled to

 ask the Association to join, as well as ornithologists of all countries.

      It cannot be doubted that henceforth, as regards the British Islands,

there is now established a lirm basis on which may rest a sound and
proper conception of many of the phenomena of British migration, for

 this Digest contains a plain statement of ascertained facts, and is wholly
free from theory or speculation of any kind. Thus it will be found to
 differ from almost everything that has hitherto been published on the

 subject,

     In saying this much your Committee would, however, guard them-

--selves from the inference that the business is exhausted on the contrary,

 a very great deal more is yet to be learned from a further examination of
 the observations which have been collected at the Lighthouses and Light-
 ships, while the whole subject of inland migration is untouched. Whether
 it will be possible for the Committee to proceed further must entirely de-

 pend on the action of the Association ; but they may say that Mr. Clarke,

 so far from being deterred by the magnitude of the task with which he
 has so successfully grappled, is willing to work out the details of migra-
 tion for each of the species to which the observations refer, and has even
 already begun to do so ; and it is to be hoped that he will receive some

 encouragement to continue such useful work. And the Committee may re-

 mark that the very considerable funds that private generosity has placed
 at their service are now exhausted.

      Though on the present occasion the thanks of the Committee are so

 certainly due to Mr. Clarke, they feel that, while presenting what may be

 their final Report, they must again acknowledge their indebtedness to all

 who have helped them in prosecuting their enquiries ; first, to the Master

 and Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, the Commissioners of Northern
 Lights, and the Commissioners of Irish Lights ; but more especially to the

 men of the several Lighthouses and Lightships, without whose cheerful

 and intelligent co-operation nothing could have been done.

coasts of the British Islands, to tlie Committee appointed by the British

Association for the investigation of that sabject, during the years

1880-1887 inclusive, I beg to offer an explanation regarding the lapse of

time that has taken place between my appointment and the completion of

the work.

In a word, this has been entirely due to the magnitude of the under-

taking.

I was Instructed to base the Digest upon an examination de novo

of the whole of the information furnished to the Committee during the

eight years of its active existence. Thus the whole of the data required

to be reduced to order before it was available for the purposes of the

--Digest. Moreover, at the outset there presented itself for consideration

an extremely perplexing problem, namely -How to treat or arrange such

a vast array of facts on a systematic plan which would render them com-

prehensive, and at the same time suited to the enquiry in all its varied

aspects. It was not until a number of abortive attempts had been

embarked upon that a plan was devised which met the very special

requirements of the case. The scheme finally adopted took the form of a

Schedule. This was designed to show graphically for each species during

each month (1) on what Day ; (2) Coast ; (3) Station ; (4) in what Num-
bers ; and (5) whether during the Day or Night the particular species

was observed during the particular month and year. It is needless to

remark that such a systematic tabulation of at least one hundred thousand

records, culled from several thousands of forms tilled in by the Light

Keepers, in each of which species were numerous and the dates wide-

ranging, proved to be both a long and laborious task.
    The results now presented are, for the lirst time, based upon the ex-

amination of the lohole of the information communicated to the Committee

for all the coasts : a most necessary condition, for from such a complete

and comprehensive examination alone could it be at all possible to obtain

results worthy of the enquiry, and an accurate knowledge of the nature of

the various phenomena associated with the migration of British and Irish
birds. Indeed, it is now in our power to declare that it is quite impos-

sible, at certain seasons, to distinguish between the widely different

Immigratory and Emigratory movements, without due examination and

consideration of the whole of the observations, a fact the non-realisation

of which has been fruitful of much misconception and of many misleading

statements in the past.

It is manifestly impossible to conduct an enquiry into the migration

of birds over the entire British area, or even of the smallest section of

Ait, under other than imperfect conditions.  hundred circumstances are
--against such a desirable consummation even if a party of trained orni-

thologists were placed at each station, it would fail to secure anything like

perfect results.

Remembering, then, the peculiar difficulties and the drawbacks that

beset such an investigation, and the further fact that the entire staff of
                    ON tup: migration of birds.                                                                                                                                                                              453

observers were volunteers, the nature of the data obtained is most satis-

factory. It lias proved to be adequate for the purpose of the inquiry,

and surprisingly accurate. Indeed, it is often quite wonderful how the
observations made at a particular station are borne out by the records at

others.

     The object of the enquiry was to obtain full and trustworthy infor-
mation in connection with the migratory movements of birds as observed

on our coasts, and not to solve problems connected with the causes

of the phenomena, the evolution of tlie migratory instinct, or other purely

theoretical aspects of the general subject.

    As regards the importance of this investigation, it must be borne in
mind that the observers were most favourably stationed for witnessing

migration in its various phases, and that such a voluminous and complete
set of observations has never been amassed at any previous period in the

liistory of the study of bird-migration. Its special nature can only be

fully appreciated when it is realised that, in order to study the pheno-
mena of bird-migration in the British Islands, it is necessary that the
data upon which any deductions may be satisfactorily or safely founded

should be based upon observations taken synchronously at stations encir-
cling the entire coasts. This cardinal and most important condition has
been attempted and accomplished for the lirst time, either in this or any

other country, through the labours of the Committee.

     The meteorological aspect of the subject has received very careful
attention, and with interesting and important results. In connection
with this portion of the work the ' Daily Weather Reports ' issued by the

Meteorological Office have been consulted and correlated with the data

relating to the migratory movements for each year of the inquiry.

Finally, I may state that the results now communicated are based ab-

solutely upon  the  records                                                                                         obtained  by  the  Committee                                                                and,  also,  that  I
                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

have approached the subject with an open mind and without preconceived

ideas. I have considered tliis not the place for theory, but for the esta-

blishment of facts, and for deductions drawn from a direct study of the

observations placed in my hands.

Bird Migration as observed on the British axd Irish Coasts.

The migration of birds, as observed in the British Islands, is a very

complex phenomenon                                                                                                  more so, perhaps, than in  any other region of                                                           the
                                                                                                                 ;

globe. This is readily accounted for.

First, the Geographical position of the British Islands is eminently

favourable. Placed, as our Isles are, between South-western Europe and

the Scandinavian Peninsula, Iceland, and Greenland, they lie directly in

the course of the legions of migratory birds which annually make a double

journey between their northern summer and their southern winter

quai-ters. For these Birds of Passage our shores form not only a main

and much accustomed highway, but afford convenient resting quarters.

Secondly, our Islands have a vast bird-population of their own, and

the majority of these birds belong to purely migratory species. Some of
them are either Summer Visitors from the southern regions or Winter

Visitors from continental Europe, Iceland, etc.

    Thirdly, many individuals of species which are sedentary in our Islands

are strictly migratory. This is especially the case in the more northern
                         --

454 REPORT 1896.

and elevated portions of the British area ; hence these species are said to
be ' Partial Migrants.'

     Finally, our remarkably variable climate is a constant element of dis-

turbance, causing much migration within the British area itself and inter-

migration with the islands off our western coasts, especially with Ireland.
This occurs during the winter months, and hence these migrations will be
alluded to in this report as 'Winter Movements.'

     The above important considerations and influences result not only in
much migration of a varied nature being witnessed on our shores, but
often, through a combination of meteorological conditions, in more than
one movement being observed in progress simultaneously, adding much
further intricacy to an already complicated series of phenomena.

     Having thus shortly described the British Islands as a highway for
and as a source of migration, having mentioned the nature of the various
movements observed on our coasts, and having alluded to the influence
exerted by climatic conditions upon the bird-population of our area, I
may now proceed to discuss the main results obtained through the enquiry
under the following sections : (1) Geographical, (2) Seasonal, and (3)

Meteorological.

                                                GEOGRAPHICAL.

   --General. In passing from their summer to their winter haunts, birds

proceed from a northern to a southern clime, and vice versa in the spring.
It does not at all follow, however, that these seasonal haunts are reached
by a simple movement from north to south, or the reverse. Each species
or individual of migratory bird has its particular summer and winter

--resorts, and these do not necessarily lie in the same meridian indeed this

is often far from being the case. To attain these particular seasonal
habitats many of tlie voyagers must depart more or less considerably from
a direct course. This is especially the case in Western Europe, where,
owing to the south-western extension of the land-masses, and the conse-
quent irregularity of the coast line, various more or less devious routes
must be, and are followed. The interposition of the British Islands between
the north-western portion of the Continental Area on the one hand and
Iceland and Greenland on the other, is an important additional factor in

this deviation.

     The geographical distribution of birds during migration on the British
and Irish Coasts, and the routes traversed, naturally depend upon the
nature of the particular movement.

      The chief and most interesting movements from tlie geographical
standpoint are the intermigrations between our Islands and Europe.
There are, however, a number of movements between the various sections
of the British and Irish areas which are of considerable importance.

   --Intermigration betiveen Britain and Northern Continental Eurojye.

Between Britain and Continental Europe travel a host of migrants which
are either birds of passage on, or winter visitors to, our shores. The
former visit our eastern coast-line in spring when journeying to their
northern summer haunts lying to the north-east of Britain, and again in
autumn when returning to their winter quarters to the south of our
Islands. The %vinter visitors are chiefly individuals from the ranks of
certain species of the birds of passage which winter in the British area
and emigrate to the north-east in the spring.

     lu the autumn these numerous migrants cross the North Sea and
ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.                                     465

arrive on the east shores of Britain at points between the Shetland Isles

and the Humber or the northern seaboard of Norfolk. All the move-

ments do not necessarily cover this extensive stretch of coast-line, but such
is not infrequently the case. Indeed, as a rule, they are recorded from

the greater part of the region indicated. It is possible to define the
southern limit on the coast at which these birds sti-ike Britain, with a

considerable degree of precision. No section of the British coast is so

well equipped with light-stations as that which lies between the north
coast of Norfolk and Dungeness. In addition to an average number of
lighthouses, there is a fleet of lightships oQ.' the coast, which are most
favourably situated for recording the movements of birds crossing the

North Sea to the English coast. These lightships have furnished the
Committee with some of the most carefully kept records to be found

among the returns, and it is a very significant fact that these great

autumn immigratory movements are not observed at these south-eastern

lighthouses and lightships. Evidence of a particularly important nature,

in this connection, is also afforded by the records kept at the Outer Dow-
sinw Lightship, the most isolated of the stations in the North Sea, situated

--about 38 miles E.S.E. of the mouth of the Humber. At this station these

important movements are not observed another significant fact, indicat-
ing- unmistakably that these migrants pass to the northward or westward

of this Lightship.

     The conclusion at which I have arrived, after a long and careful study
·of the records, is that these immigrants and emigrants from and to
Northern Europe pass and repass between this portion of the Continent
and Britain by crossing the North Sea in autumn in a south-westerly

direction, and in spring in a north-easterly one,^ and that, while the limit
to their flight in the north is the Shetland Islands, that on the south ex-
tends to the coast of Norfolk.^ During these movements the more

southern portion of the east coast of England is reached after the arrival

of the immigrants on the more northern portions.
     It is to be remarked, also, as beai'ing upon this important point, that

<ill the species occur on migration in the Orkney and Shetland Islands,

but not in the Fffiroes.^ And, further, all the British birds of passage to
Northern Europe are either summer visitors to Scandinavia or are regular

migrants along the western shores of that peninsula.

     After arriving on our eastern shores, these immigrants from the

-- --north some of them after resting for a while move either down the

east coast, en route for more southern winter quarters, or, if winter
Avisitors, to their accustomed haunts in Britain and Ireland.
                                                               few occur

as birds of passage on the west coast and in Ireland, which they reach

by overland routes across Britain, and then pass southwards to their

winter quarters. The west coasts, however, do not receive directly any

immigrants from Continental Europe.

Intermigration between the South-east Coast of England and the Coast

     ' The direction varies. It is probably more westerly (in autumn) or easterly (in
spring) at the most northern British stations, and south-south-westerly (in autumn)

or north-north-easterly (in spring) at the stations on the east coast of England.
     - The formation adopted by the migrants during passage would seem to be an

-- --extended line perhaps a series of lines whose right wing extends to the Northern

Islands and its left wing to the coast of Norfolk.

    A' few species occur in the F;eroes on migration, but these are also summer

visitors to those islands and to Iceland.

--<of "Western Eurojn--^ East and West Route. This is one of the discoveries

of the enquiry. It has been already shown that the more southern section
of the East coast of England does not receive immigrants direct from
Northern Europe. There is, however, a considerable amount of migration

of a particular description, and on the part of certain species, observed
at the lightships and lighthouses between the Kentish coast and the
Wash. During the autumn, day after day, a stream of migrants, often

of great volume, is observed off the coast, flowing chiefly from the south-
east to the north-west at the more northerly stations, and from east to
west at the southerly ones, across the southernmost waters of the North

Sea. This will be hereafter mentioned as the ' East and West Route.'
From the stations off the mouth of the Thames as a centre, the birds-
either sweej) up the east coast, sometimes to and beyond the Tees (many

proceeding inland as they go), or pass to the west along the southern

shores of England. These important immigrations set in during the latter

days of September, reach their maximum in October, and continue at

intervals until November. They are chronicled with wonderful precision

and regularity in the returns from the stations on the south-east coast of

England. They are renewed during winter on occasions of exceptionally

severe cold, but the birds then jDass to the westward along our southern

shores.

     There are some remarkable features associated with these movements :

(1)  They are  frequently observed                                  for  several or many                                                                                                                                              consecutive  days

     Whether this east to west stream is a branch of one that passes down

the coast of Continental Europe, or whether it has its source in Central

Europe, is a matter of conjecture.^

     The conclusions relating to these continental migration-routes have
been chiefly based upon the autumn data, because the information for
that season is much more voluminous and complete. When, however,,
we come to examine the information relating to the spring movements,,
with a view to ascertaining how far they corroborate the conclusions

so clearly indicated by the autumn chronicles, it is satisfactory to find

decided evidence that the birds retrace their flight to the north and east
along precisely the same lines as those along which the autumnal

     ' It is probable that such species as the Golden Oriole, Hoopoe, &c., which occur
annually during spring and autumn migration in southern and south-eastein
England, and the Black Redstart as a winter visitor, are birds that proceed along
this route to and from our Islands.

rence of the Rook so frequently and in such numbers is suggestive of a Central

southerly and westerly journeys wei-e performed. Thus in the sprin o
these birds depart from the same sections of our eastern seaboai-d as

witnessed their arrival in the autumn.

   --Intermigration between Ilehgolayid and Britain. Much prominence

has been given in some of the Annual Reports issued by the Committee,,

and in Herr Gatke's book, ' Die Vogelwarte Helgoland,' to an intermigrar

tion between Heligoland and the east coast of England by a direct east-to-
west autumn, and it is to be presumed west-to-east spring, movements

Herr Gatke most obligingly communicated the details of the bird-

movements observed on Heligoland for four of the years (1883--1886)

during which the inquiry was being prosecuted over the British area.
These two sets of data have been carefully examined and compared, and

it has been found that the dates of the chief movements of the species
common to Heligoland and Eastern Britain seldom if ever correspond, and

do not bear out this theory ; that particular species which are irregular as
migrants in Britain, such as the Ortolan Bunting, and others, occur regu-
larly, often indeed in 'rushes,' at the more favoured isle off the mouth of

the Elbe ; that other species, which are very rare on our British shores,,
occur in Heligoland as i-egular migrants and in considerable numbers, as.

Motacilla Jiava, Anthus Ricliardi, &c. ; while species common to both

islands occur in 'flights like clouds,' in 'hundreds of thousands,' 'thou-

sands upon thousands,' in ' marvellous numbers,' ' astonishing flights,' and

so on, at Heligoland, at periods when there is not a single observation for

Athe same species on the English shores.  study of the phenomena of

migration at the stations on the east and west sides of the North Sea

compels the investigator to come to the conclusion that Heligoland and

Britain draw their migratory hosts from different sourceg. The ordinary-

movements of any common migratory bird occur in each month of its

seasonal flight-pei'iods, and the mere coincidence of the species being ob-

served simultaneously in ordinary numbers on both sides of the North Sea

has no significance whatever. It is not impossible or improbable tha.t

birds may occasionally cross the German Ocean by an east-to-west flight.

in the latitude of Heligoland, but our data lead us to believe that sucli

cases are the rare exception and not the rule.

  --Intermigration between Britain and Foiroes, Iceland, and Greenland.

The Faroes, Iceland, and Greenland are the summer home of several Palaj-

arctic species which occur as bii-ds of passage on the British coasts. Tb,&

majority of these visit Iceland, and Greenland claims only two or three of

them (Wheatear, White AVagtail, and Whimbrel). It is natural that these-

birds being of strictly Old World species, our Islands should lie in the-
course of their migrations. It is quite pos.sible that these migrants may

pass along both the eastern and western coasts of Britain and the coasts

of Ireland. Here, at any rate, we have evidence that these birds are ob-
served on passage on our western shores. It may be that some of the

birds proceed also along our eastern seaboard, but this is a point difticult

to determine. There is good evidence, however, that important move-

ments of Redwings, Wheatears, and Whimbrels are observed on the west-

ern coast of Great Britain and the Irish coasts (both east and west as

regards the passage of the Whimbrel), which are not observed elsewhere.

Such a fact points to the independent nature of these west coast flights,
and indicates that, in some instances at least, the western route alone is

followed.

It is thus evident that, so far as concerns the movements of the birds
458 EEPORT-- 1896.

of passage to and from their northern breedin<]f haunts, the British east
and west coast migratory movements are very distinct in their characters.
The west coast does not receive immigrants direct from Europe, nor do
these continental breeding species depart from its shores in the spring.

Indeed, it is quite remarkable how rare, or comparatively rare, certain

 well-known east coast species are on the western portion of our shores.

     With the movements of the British migratory birds next to be con-

sidered it is quite different, for, with the exception of a few species whose

summer haunts are much circumscribed iii our Islands, the movements are
not only common to both coasts, but the great emigratory flights are
usually simultaneously observed on the east, west, and south coasts, and
also on those of Ireland.

      The west coast of Great Britain and the Irish coasts are thus only
under much migration during the great autumn departure movements from
our shores, and to a less extent during the return movements in spring.

     Ititermigration between Great Britain and Ireland and the South, &c.--
 Having shortly described the migratory movements between the British

 Islands and Northern and Western Europe, undertaken by birds of pass-
age and winter visitors to our Islands, the routes on our coasts along
which the summer visitors ' travel to and from their breeding quarters

in Great Britain and Ireland now demand attention in tlieir geographical

.aspect. It will be convenient also to refer to the routes between the dif-
ferent portions of the British area under this division.

   --The autumn or emigratory movements will be described but it is

necessary to remark that the data clearly indicate that the spring migra-
tory movements along our western shores are simply return movements,
on the part of the same species, along the same lines of flight as those laid

down for the autumn.
      The movements of these groups of migrants will be treated of under

the various sections of our coasts. The first movement on the part of all
emigrants among British birds is to the coast, which is reached in some
cases, no doubt, by particular inland routes.

   --East Coast of Great Britain. The emigratory movements on the east

coast are very simple in their geographical aspect. When the coast is

reached, the emigrants follow the coastline southward, gathering strength
as they go, and finally quit our shores at various points on the south
coast of England.

     It is during such autumnal movements that the more southern coast-
line of Eastern England, and its off-shore fleet of lightships, record night
migration. The ranks of the British emigrants are, as we have said, re-
cruited as they fly onward, and if a great movement should be in progress,

the causing-influence will affect also many birds of passage which may be
sojourning on our shores. Two wings of the migratory army thus com-

bine, and a great ' rush ' to the south is the result.

   --West Coast of Great Britain. The emigratory movements which pass

down the west coast are far from being so simple in their geographical

details as those observed on the east.

     That such should be the case is not surprising. Here we have Ireland,
the Isle of Man, the Hebrides, and an extremely irregular coastline exer-
cising their varied influences. In addition, there are intermigrations

      ' Those birds which have been described as ' partial migrants ' are included in

this category.
--

ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  459

between these off-lying isles and the mainland, and often movements of
an independent nature in some portion of the western area.

     The general route followed by these departing birds has its north-
western source in the Outer Hebrides, and after leaving Barra Head it
joins an important stream from the Inner Hebrides at 8kerryvore. The
course then followed is vid Dhuheartach, Islay, the Wigtonshire coast,
the Isle of Man, Anglesey, and the South Bishop (off Pembrokeshire).
Finally, the south-western coast of England is reached (possibly in part
by an overland route across Devonshire and Cornwall) between the
Scilly Islands and Start Point.

      In its course southward considerable tributaries, so to speak, are
received at Cantire, Arran, the Ayrshire and Wigtonshire coasts, and the

Solway, of birds passing down the west coast of Scotland. At the

Bristol Channel emigrants are received from western England and Wales,
and often also important contributions are added from the south-eastern

coast of Ireland.

     In connection with these movements there are several more or less
important features to note. (1) The English shores of the Irish Sea,

-- --i.e. the coasts of Cumberland and Lancashire lie off the main line of

these movements. (2) The north coast of Ireland, which seems to lie
right in the course of the birds, and which would naturally be expected
to come in for a considerable share of such movements, appears to be only
occasionally affected by them. (3) The Irish contributory movements when
they occur are chiefly, nay almost entirely, observed on the southern, and
especially the south-eastern coasts. (4) The south-western coast of
England and Wales i.e. from the mouth of the Bristol Channel to the

--Land's End and the Scilly Isles appears to be especially affected when

there are considerable movements on the southern and south-eastern
coasts of Ireland, implying that there is much intermigration between
these particular portions of the English and Irish coasts. Sometimes,

however, these emigrations from Ireland only affect the south-west coast
of England from the Bishop's Rock (off Scilly) to Start Point.

  --li-ish Coasts. The Irish chronicles have been most excellently and

carefully kept, and the returns of specimens killed against the lanterns
a,t the stations have been larger and more valuable than those furnished
from the coasts of Great Britain.

     The coasts of Ireland do not constitute in themselves a main highway
for birds, though they participate, along with the western shores of Great
Britain, in certain movements to and from the far north on the part of

the section of the birds of passage ah-eady alluded to. Indeed, the

majority of the migrants observed on the shores of the sister isle are

probably the migratory members of her own avifauna.
     The movements of departing birds during the autumn at the southern

and south-eastern stations have already been mentioned, and when mi-
gration is going on at this part of the coast there is often recorded an
emigratory movement along the western coast from Slyne Head south-

wards, which probably forms a contributory stream to the general

movement to the south. These Irish emigrations, as a rule, occur
simultaneously with similar movements passing down the western coast of
Great Britain, and the two streams meet and unite at points between the
Bristol Channel and the Scilly Isles. Some of the Irish autumnal

flights, however, are quite independent of these general movements.

     There is much evidence to show that not only do the autumnal
460 REPORT-- 1896.

emigrants depart from the south-east coast of Ireland en route for more
southern winter-quarters, but also, strange to say, that many birds (e.g.
Thrushes, Redwings, Blackbirds, Chaffinches, Greenfinches, Linnets, Star-
lings, Larks) almost simultaneously enter that country by this very same
section of her shores, in order to winter within her limits. These
immigrants are often observed ai-riving from the south-east in great
numbers for several days in succession. The English west coast observa-

tions also bear evidence that such movements proceed across St. George's
Channel in a north-westerly direction. TJiese cross-channel flights are
 usually observed during the daytime, but sometimes the arrival of certain
of these birds on the Irish coast takes pln,ce during the night.

      According to the records it is only occasionally, as already stated,
that the southerly autumnal movements from Western Scotland are

observed at the northern Irish stations. Now and then, however, there

is evidence that a considerable number of birds do arrive on, or skirt, the
north coast of Ireland during the more pronounced west coast emigratory

 fiights.

      Independently of, and in addition to, these main Irish migratory
movements. Thrushes, Larks, and Starlings occur in October and November
on the northern coasts of Ireland from Tory Island to the Maidens as
immigrants from Scotland. These are to be correlated with movements
of the same species observed at the Rhinns of Islay and the Wigton
coast. Larks, too, are often recorded for this route during the daytime.

      There are also autumnal movements between Ireland and England
and Wales by an east to west flight across the Irish Sea, on the part

of Starlings, Chaffinches, Greenfinches, Larks, and sometimes of various
species of Thrushes. Anglesey is the chief Welsh point, and Rockabill
(off the north coast of Co. Dublin) the main Irish station at which these
departures and arrivals are observed.

     The migratory movements observed on the west coast of Ireland are
neither many nor important, and consist almost entirely of movements
on the part of emigratory Irish birds. There are, however, remarkable
immigrations from home sources witnessed on the west coast and its off-
lying islets during great cold and snow, to which we shall have occasion
to refer under the Seasonal and Meteorological Sections of this Report.

   --South Coast of England. It is much to be regretted that observations

relating to the migrations of birds on the southern coast of England
as a whole were not obtained by the Committee. The data bearing
upon this important English coast-line are from a few stations on the
south-eastern and south-western portions only.

     This information points to (1) a considerable amount of migration
taking place between these portions of the coast-line and South-western
Europe, and (2) important movements passing along the entire coast-line
from east to west in autumn and probably vice versa in spring.

     The south coast is naturally the great scene of the arrival and
departure of migratory birds of all descriptions, but the movements along
shore are, perhaps, in some of their aspects, moi-e interesting. Regarding
these last, much remains to be ascertained concerning their precise nature
and the destination of some of the birds travelling along this route.

     In the autumn this coasting stream of birds has its source chiefly in
the immigratcry movements from the Continent across the southern
watersof the North Sea by the East and West Route, of which it is but

a continuation. It is possible also that British emigrants, after passing
ON THE MIGRATION OF BIKDS.  461

down the east coast of England, may turn to the westward and skirt

the south coast, but this is not shown with certainty.
     The continental immigrants strike the Kentish shore, and, as has

been already stated, some pass to the north along the east coast of

England, while others pursue a westerly course along our shores of the
Channel. The stations on the south-western coast again record these
migrants, and the probable destination of many, perhaps most of them, is
Ireland, on whose south-eastern shores the birds are chronicled, almost
simultaneously, as arriving in great numbers from the south-east.

   --It is possible, however, that some of these birds the Skylark espe-
--cially may reach a much more remarkable destination, for one branch of

tbe stream sweeps northwards, being observed at the mouth of the Bristol

Channel, at Anglesey, and at the Isle of Man stations, proceeding to the

west and north-west, probably to Northern Ireland ; while on the
Wigtonshire coast and at the rocks of Dhuheartach and Skerryvore these
birds are noted as moving in the direction of the Outer Hebrides.

     The great autumnal movements from east to west along the south
coast of England are renewed in winter, when that season is characterised
by periods of unusual cold. At such times it is possible that this
western stream is composed in part of native emigrants Avhich have
passed down our eastern coasts, as well as of birds of continental

origin.

   --Channel Islands. Records from the Hanois Lighthouse, situated

some two miles off the west coast of Guernsey, were furnished for
each of the years of the enquiry, and afford some useful information.
These, when compared with the English and Irish chronicles, show that
on nearly every occasion on which considerable migration was observed
at this station in the autumn, there was also much emigration going on
practically simultaneously on the south-west coast of England. It is
necessary, however, to state that a number of important movements on the
south-west coast of England do not appear in the records for Hanois,

indicating, perhaps, that many movements to the south in autumn and to

the north in spring pass to the westward of this station. In the spring,
Swallows are observed passing to both the north-east and north-west in

great numbers during April and May, and a number of other summer

birds are recorded on passage.

                                                       SEASONAL.

     The Seasonal Section of the Report is readily subdivided for treat-
ment into Autunni, Winter, and Spring.

   A few words are necessary in explanation of the differences between

the autumn, spring, and winter migratory movements as observed in the
British Isles, for they are performed under very different conditions and
influences. These remarks apply more particularly to the birds of
passage, yet they are also applicable, to some extent, to our native

seasonal visitors.

     In the Autumn the birds, when they appear on our shores, liave

--accomplished the great business of the year procreation. Food is still

abundant in their favourite resting haunts, and hence there is no par-

ticular hurry to move southwards. Thus many species tarry on our

coasts or in their vicinity, some for a considerable period. Their numbers
are, of course, incomparably greater than during the northward journey,
462 REPORT-- 1896.

as they are swelled by the numerous young birds, now a few weeks old.
All these circumstances and conditions combine to make the autumn
movements comparatively easy of observation.

     In Spring the conditions are quite different. The all-absorbing duties
of the season and the procreative influence are upon the voyagers, and

since our Islands form one of the last stages in the journey of many

species, the birds usually hurry on after a short sojourn for rest and food
only. Thus the spring movements do not afford much facility or oppor-
tunity for observation ; indeed, with most species their appearance

amounts to 'here to-day, off to-morrow.' Hence some species and many
individuals entirely escape notice at a number of the observing stations.

     All that it is necessary to say here regarding the Winter Movements is

that they are entirely the effect of severe weather.

   --Autumn Immigration. -As the summer, more particularly the arctic

summer, is at its height during July, it is not to be expected that immi-

grants among the northern summer-birds would appear on our shores on
their return journey during this month. The initial movements of the
autumn, whatever their significance may be, do, as a matter of fact, set
in towards the end of July. Of the species observed, the Whimbrel
and the Knot are the most frequently recorded. The Green Sandpiper,
Curlew Sandpiper, Bar-tailed Godwit, and Turnstone are less frequent.

A few others appear only occasionally in the chronicles of the month.

      In all probability these July immigrants, or the majority of them, are
non-breeding birds of their respective species, which have not, perhaps,
proceeded far beyond the limits of Britain on their spring journey north-
ward. That such is the case is borne out by the fact that these July birds

are all, so far as reported, adults.

     Immigration sets in in earnest during August on the part of those
species breeding northwards beyond the British area, and either occurring
as birds of passage or as winter visitors to our isles. The former include
the northern representatives of several species which are summer visitors
to Britain. The return movements of twenty-six species of birds whose
summer haunts lie entirely beyond the British area are chronicled for the

month.
     During Septembkr a marked increase in immigration takes place as

regards both species and more especially individuals. In all, over forty
species of European birds which do not summer in Britain are recorded
as migrants for September, including all the species regularly recorded
for August. In some years (1881 and 1883) there have occurred in Sep-
tember the first of the great autumnal ' rushes ' of immigrants from the
north to our shores. These decided movements are, however, entirely
the effect of meteorological conditions at the seat of emigration, of which
special mention is presently to be made in the Meteorological section.

     In October the flood of immigratory birds reaches its highest level,
and there are experienced those vast ' rushes ' upon our shores just
mentioned. The additions to the list of extra-British breeding species
are comparatively numerous, forty-seven species of regular birds of
passage, besides many other birds breeding in both Northern Europe and
Britain, being recorded. But, on the other hand, the movements of cer-

tain other species have, according to our chronicles, already ceased to

occur, and it may be taken that the majority have passed,' while a few

others do not appear so numerously as heretofore.

    ' Tliese are the White Wagtail, Temminck's Stint, Wood Sandpiper, Green Sand-

piper, and Spotted Redshank.
ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.                                          463

     The immigr.atory movements occurring in Novkmber are not only on
a very much reduced scale, but after the middle of the month the immigra-
tion of such birds as spend the summer in the North entirely ceases, with the

exception of those of certain marine species (Ducks, Gulls, Grebes, Swans),
whose late movements to the South are dependent upon severe weather

conditions.' This is entirely contrary to the views hitherto propounded

regarding the limits of these movements, but it is, nevertheless, a fact

Avell established by this inquiry.

   A few (six only 2) northern summer birds which do not breed in

Britain still occur as immigrants during the earlier days of the month,

often in considerable numbers. The additions for the month are species

which only occasionally occur, and whose appearance is in some cases
Aindicative of weather influences.
                                    few northern species are recorded
--more numerously during November than earlier in the autumn namely,

the Lapland Bunting, the Swans, Ducks generally, the Ringdove, the

winter Grebes, and the Little Auk, the last, however, irregularly.

     The immigrants hitherto considered are those derived from the north.
There now remain for treatment those which reach us by a westerly
movement along the East and West Route, and arrive on the south-

eastern shores of England. These diurnal movements set in during-
the latter days of September, when Larks, ' Crows ' (Rooks), Tree-
Sparrows, and some Redbreasts are observed. Immigration increases in
volume in October, when, in addition to the species mentioned. Black-
birds, Thrushes, Grey Crows, Chaffinches, Greenfinches, Goldcrests,
and, occasionally. Woodcocks are observed. The movements continue
until the middle of November, when they too, during ordinary seasons,
cease to be observed. They are renewed again, however, on the part
of Larks, Starlings, Thrushes, and Lapwings on the advent of great
cold, when the birds chiefly pass westwards along the south coast of

England.

     During immigration our shores are reached during the late night or

early morning on the part of migrants from the north. On the contrary

the immigratory movements from the east, across the narrows of the

--North Sea, appear to be performed during the daytime.
    Autumn Emigration. It is somewhat difficult to determine what
species among our British summer visitors are true emigrants during

July. There is no doubt, however, that the departure of adult Cuckoos
dates from the latter days of the month, when they not only appear on
the coast-line, but are occasionally killed against the lanterns of the light-
stations. The Swift is another species that appears with some frequency

at the stations, which fact indicates that the ebb of its summer sojourn

in Bi-itain has begun. During the month, especially towards its close,

there are now and then records of the movements of small numbers

of * Thrushes, * Blackbirds, * Wheatears, Whinchats, Redstarts, * Red-

breasts, Whitethroats, Goldcrests, Chiffchafls, Willow Warblers, Pied

Wagtails, Grey Wagtails, Meadow Pipits, Swallows, House Martins,

    ' On a few occasions during the j-ears of the inquiry sereral Thrushes, Fieldfares,
Woodcocks, Snipes, and Plovers have been observed in the Orkneys and Shetlands {e.g.

(lurinj? the exceptionally severe winters of 1882 and 188(5). These may, perhaps,

have been immigrants, or they may have been birds that, had moved to island-haunts

from the mainland during the period of great cold.

        These are the Redwing, Fieldfare, Great Grey Shrike, Brambling, Jack Snipe,
and Knot. The Snow Bunting also occurs in some numbers.

Chaffinches, Starlings, Rooks, * Skylarks, Short-eared Owls, Herons, Grey-

lag Geese, Land Rails, and Richardson's Skuas.

      It is well, however, to bear in mind, in connection with such July
movements, that during this month there is a vast increase in our
feathered population in the shape of birds but a few weeks old. These

youngsters are many of them outcasts whose parents are engaged with
second families, and many of them may, in their wanderings, finally reach

the coast, where their appeai'ance is daly chronicled by the observers.
      Another class of migratory birds, namely, certain Plovers and Sand-

pipers wliich spend the summer inland and the autumn and winter on the
shore, also appear on the coast in small numbers accompanied by their young.

-- --The young of several species of sea-fowl Razorbill, Guillemot, and Puffin

are mentioned as leaving their rocky nursei'ies during the month. Lastly,

it is certain that some of the movements recorded for this month are due

to spells of ungenial weather. This aspect of July emigration, however,
belongs to, and will be treated of under, the Meteorological Section of this

 Digest.

     During August much emigration among our summer visitors is
witnessed, and thirty-three species are recorded as departing. Of the

birds which are partially migratory, no fewer than thirty -four species are
noticed as emigratory during August, though, perhaps, all are not neces-
sarily passing beyond the British area.

      Both these groups of emigrants are in all probability swelled during
this and other months by birds of the same species, which pass the sum-
mer in countries north of the British Isles, and which, having reached
our shores as immigrants, are also moving southwards along our coast-

 lines.

      September witnesses the height and close of the emigration of the
bulk of the smaller British summer visitor.-^, most of which are absent
from the chronicles for October. The movements of forty-two of these
emigrants appear in the records for the month ; while those of the partial
migrants are also considerable, over forty species being recorded. There
are often during this month considerable emigratory ' rushes ' on the part
of both these groups of migratory birds, due to outbursts of ungenial
 weather in our Islands.

      The October emigrants among the summer birds are not numerous,
and consist of laggard representatives of their kinds. Only twenty-two
species are recorded in the chronicles for the month, and some of these
are onlj' observed occasionally. The partial migrants, on the other hand,
are much on the move, and are numerous both as regards individuals and
species, their ranks, no doubt, being considerably recruited by numbers
of the same species from the north, which sooner or later emigrate in
 their company. These movements are often pronounced, and ' rushes
are recorded ; but they cease by or during the fii-st half of November.

      It is during the great autumn emigrations that the birds are observed
 on all our shores simultaneously.

      Emigratory birds are observed passing southwards, and feeding as
they go during the daytime ; but their flight to lands beyond our shores
is usually undertaken during the nighttime.

      Under certain peculiar weather conditions, which will be fully ex-

 lanterns.

plained in their proper place, there are immigratory and emigratory
movements simultaneously observed on our coasts, the former aflFecting

--the east coast line only.
     Winter Movements. In November, and not later than the middle of
the month, the ordinary autumnal southward movements on the part
of birds of passage and of British emigrants cease.

     These normal seasonal movements are followed later in the month by
emigratory -movements of a very different nature, and entirely due
to a decided fall in temperature, usually in the form of outbursts of

frost, and to snow. These conditions drive certain species specially
affected either to warmer districts within the British area, or to southern
regions beyond our shores. Such movements as these naturally become
more pronounced as the winter advances, and especially so during severe
seasons. They are repeated during each cold spell in the months of
December, January, February, and in some exceptional seasons as
late as the third week of March.

    As soon as frost sets in, particularly if accompanied by snow and

sleet, even if it is only locally dift'used, it causes an immediate rush to
the coast and its adjacent islands, especially to the western seaboard and

to Ireland, where a milder climate usually prevails.
     The appearance of these birds on the coast in the late autumn and

winter has led them to be regarded as immigrants from abroad. But
when the whole of the data relating to their distribution is examined,
the true nature of these movements is no longer doubtful ; and this is

the case quite apart from the weather conditions, which, in all instances,

also afford an unfailing clue to their true character.
     If the cold is very severe and prolonged, the isles off the south-

west coast, such as Scilly and those off the west coast of Ireland, are

sought, and many birds are observed at the southern stations to quit
both Britain and Ireland. At such times these great western movements

form the most prominent feature of the winter migratory records.
    In the terrible December of 1882, even these usually safe western

retreats failed the refugees, and many succumbed, the hardy Snow Bunt-

ing perishing along with the rest. The Januaries of 1881, 1885, and
1887 were also very severe, and were months of great cold- weather move-

ments. In 1881 many birds died of starvation at Valentia, then the

least cold corner of the British area.

     During exceptionally severe winters there is a renewal of immigratory

movements from the continent by way of the East and West Route across
the southern portion of the North Sea. On arriving on our south-eastern

shores the Larks, Starlings, Thrushes, and Lapwings, which are the species
recorded, move along the south coast of England, and probably seek the

warmth of the South-west, the Scilly Isles, and Ireland.

The species which appear to be specially susceptible to cold, either

constitutionally or through deprivation of food (most probably the latter),
are the Mistletoe Thrush, Song Thrush, Redwing, Fieldfare, Blackbird,

Greenfinch, Linnet, Starling, Lark, AVater Rail, Lapwing, Curlew, Snipe,

and Woodcock.
     In mild winters the only movements recorded are a few local

migrations, which strictly coincide with the occasional periods of cold

from which hardly any season is entirely exempt.

Cold-weather migration is performed during both the night- and day-

time. If the flight is an extended one it is probably undertaken at night,

 466 REPORT-- 1896.

 for much emigration is observed at southern stations during the hours of

 darkness.

   --Spring Immigration. The first bird-harbingers of spring are recorded

 for February, when during genial periods such partial migrants
 within the British area as the Pied Wagtail and Lapwing return to the
 Orkneys and other northern stations, where these species are summer

 birds. Certain rock-breeding sea-fowl are also noted as visitors to their

 nesting haunts.

      There is in addition indication of a return movement during mild
 weather on the part of Fieldfares, Kedwings, Thrushes, Blackbirds, kc,
 which had fled the country through the winter cold. During February
certain summer visitors have occasionally put in a phenomenally early
appearance. In 1885 and 1887 the Wheatear was seen ; in 1887 a Ring
 Ouzel was shot at one of the light- stations ; and in 1886 (on the 24th)
a solitary Swallow was observed at the Eddystone.

      During the genial periods usually experienced in the changeable

month of March there is a considerable immigration or return of the

birds which quitted our Islands through the pressure of the severe
weather conditions of winter, and also of some partial migrants, including

many Gold Crests and Pied Wagtails. In most years the advent of a few
summer visitors is recorded. The Ring Ouzel, Wheatear, Whinchat,
Willow Wren, Chiffchaff, Swallow, Sand Martin, Cuckoo,' Land Rail,

Garganey, Whimbrel, and Sandwich Tern are recorded for the month,
some of them once only, and others rarely.

     April is a month of pronounced immigration on the part of the
summer visitors, for no less than thirty-seven species are recorded in the

chronicles. It thus witnesses the arrival of certainly the majority of

species among the spring migrants, though, perhaps, not of individuals.
There arrive, also, a number of migratory birds belonging to species

which are either resident in, or winter visitors to, Britain, which have

wintered to the south of us and now appear as summer birds, or as birds
of passage on their way to the north.

     In connection with the arrival of these earliest immigrants among our
summer visitors during March or April a remarkable and interesting fact

--remains to be mentioned namely, that the great majority of these birds

--are recorded first for the south-western area of the British region the

south-west coast of England and Ireland. Thus in March, out of
94 observations 71, or 75 per cent., were made in the south-west. In
April, out of 157 first records of the arrivals of summer visitors, no less
than 115, or nearly 74 per cent., are chronicled for the south-west coast
and Ireland. These numbers and percentages, however, should be
considerably higher and more remarkable, for it must be explained
that during the years 1880 and 1881 there were no spring data for
Ireland, and in 1883 there was no return made for the west coast of
England, while the east coast has been credited, in the statistics quoted,
with the observations made during all the years of the inquiry. It thus
seems probable that the first arrival of the spring migrants not unnatu-
rally occurs on those parts of our isles which are the warmest so early in

the season.

    During May the immigration of summer birds still flows into our

Islands. Several species make their first appearance, and a number of

                           ' At Langness, Isle of Man, March 28, 1887.
ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  467

others are more abundantly recorded than hitherto. There are also con-
siderable arrivals of Wheatears, Warblers, Swallows, and Sandpipers and
Plovers of Aarious species, on our southern coast quite down to the end
of the month, some of their movements being very marked. These are
undoubtedly birds of passage, on their way to northern summer haunts

beyond the limits of the British Isles, for our own birds of the same species

are then busily engaged in incubation or tending their young.

     During the first half of June several species whose breeding range
extends to the Polar regions. appear in considerable numbers on our shores
on their way to the far north ; a few appear even still later. The chief
among these late birds of passage are the Grey Plover and the Knot, and
less numerously or less frequently the Snow Bunting, Wigeon, Barnacle
Goose, ' Grey Geese,' Swans, the Dotterel, Turnstone, Sanderling, Ruff,
Bar-taiied Godwit, Whimbrel, and a few Great Northern Divers.'

     In connection with the spring immigration it has to be remarked that

the observations are all in favour of the theory that the earliest arrivals

among the summer visitors to our Islands are British-breeding birds.
This is borne out by the fact, well known to all lield-naturalists, that our
summer birds appear in their breeding haunts in our islands immediately

after their first appearance on our coasts in the spring. Additional proof

is furnished by the fact that summer birds arrive in Britain at earlier
dates than in Heligoland, where nearly all the species observed are en
route for more northern lands than ours. The further fact already men-
tioned, that down to the end of May, and in some instances the first half of
June, large numbers of birds of species which are summer visitants to
Britain, arrive on and pass along our coast as birds of passage, proves that
the migrants bound for the north are the last of their kind to appear in

the British area.

  --Spring Emigration. The spring emigration from the British Isles ta

continental Europe sets in on the part of certain species early in the year,
indeed before the winter emigratory movements have ceased to take place.

     Thus in February, in some seasons, ' Geese ' are recorded as moving
northwards in considerable numbera. The chief emigratory movements
of this month, however, are the departure of Larks and Rooks along the
' East and West Route ' to the Continent. These take place in some years
during the early days of the month, and are observed on the south-east

--coast of England chiefly at the lightships off the coasts of Essex and
--Kent where the birds observed are proceeding in a south-easterly and

easterly direction across tlje North Sea, returning by the same lines of
flight as those along which they travelled to our shores in the autumn.

    During March these south-easterly movements become more pro-

nounced, and the emigrants include the Hooded Crow, Rook, and
Skylark. Emigration for the north also commences, and the following
winter visitors are recorded as leaving our Islands during the month :
Great Grey Shrike, Shore Lark, Swans, ' Wild Geese,' Gadwall, Scaup,
Golden-eye, Long-tailed Duck, Red-throated Diver, and probably many

others. In March, too, certain species (Greenfinch, Chaffinch, Twite),
which regularly seek the islands off the west coast of Ireland as winter
retreats, are mentioned as taking their departure for the summer.

     ' The fact that these birds, or most of them, should arrive on our shores as birds
of passage thus late in the migratory season, lends some countenance to the theory
that the birds of certain species going furthest north in summer go the furthest south

for winter quarters.

                                                                                                   HH2
468 REPORT-- 1896.

     The mild spells of April induce a considerable amount of emigra-
tion, for their northern summer haunts, on the part of no less than
thirty -four species. These comprise fifteen Passeres, two Birds of Prey,
nine Ducks and Geese, six Waders, one Skua, and one Diver, all of
them belonging to species which have wintered in our Islands, or off our
shores. The emigration to the Continent by the ' East and West Route '
across the North Sea also proceeds during April, the species observed
departing during the month being the Rook, the Hooded Crow, and the

Tree Sparrow. No migratory movements, however, are recorded for this

route after this month.

    May is a month of much emigration on the part both of birds which

have wintered in our Islands, and of birds of passage (including many
individuals of species which are summer visitors to Britain). In all, no
less than fifty-three species of regular emigrants are recorded in the May

returns, showing that the movements to the northern breeding grounds

reach their maximum during this month, and often take the form of

' rushes ' after the birds have been held back by spells of ungenial weather.
The northward movements from our shores of a few species, whose breed-

ing range lies within the Polar regions, are also observed down to the

middle of June, or even beyond that date, and have already been noticed.
     The departure for their northern summer quarters of the spring birds

of passage and of the winter visitors to Britain takes place from our
eastern coasts and the northern isles ; a few only of the species, such as

the Redwing, W^heatear, White Wagtail, Barnacle Goose, Swans, Whim-

brel, &c., passing up our western coasts, possibly en route for Iceland.

                                              METEOROLOGICAL.

     Special attention has been bestowed upon this section of the Digest,
since the actual relationships between migrational and meteorological
phenomena have not hitherto received the attention they deserve, no
doubt because the necessary sets of data for a satisfactory investigation
of the problem were not obtainable. The material collected by the Com-
mittee has proved in all respects most valuable for establishing a useful
comparison between these two sets of phenomena, and for determining, to
a certain extent, the precise influence exercised by the weather upon
bird movements. The standard for the weather has been the ' Daily
Weather Reports ' issued by the Meteorological Office. For the loan of a
complete set of these valuable official I'ecords for the eight years of the

inquiry, I am indebted to the Council of the Leeds Philosophical and

Literary Society, through its esteemed Hon. Secretary, Richard Reynolds,
Esq., an obligation I here desire to fully acknowledge.

     It may be well to state that these 'Daily Reports' are based upon
observations made at fifty-four stations, distributed over Western

Europe between Haparanda and Bodo in the North, and Toulon,
Biarritz, and Corunna in the South ; as well as all parts of Great Britain
and Ireland.

    When studying bird migration in connection with meteorological con-

ditions, it is essential that the weather peculiarities synchronous with the
setting in of the emigration, and prevailing in the particular area in

which the movement had its origin, should be considered. This alone
has any true bearing upon emigration ; not the weather prevailing upon
the shores reached after an extended migratory flight. Thus the conti-
nental weather conditions must be consulted in connection with the
--

    ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  469

arrival of immigrants in the British Isles in spring and autumn, and our
home records referred to for an explanation of the movements of emi-
grants during the spring, autumn, and winter.

    As the result of an extensive series of comparisons instituted between

the two sets of phenomena, it has been ascertained that they are most inti-
mately associated, and that a knowledge of the meteorological conditions
prevailing during the movements in most instances contributes in no
small degree to a correct intei'pretation of their precise nature and the

seat of their origin.

     The weather influences are of two kinds, as treated of separately

below

  --I. Ordinary Weather Influences. It is found that in both the spring

and autumn migratory periods there are spells of genial weather without
marked features, other than those favourable for migration. During
these the movements of the various species are of an even-flowing and

continuous nature. If the weather should prove slightly unsettled during
such periods, it is a inatter of indifference to the migrants ; if more pro-
nouncedly so, their movements are slightly quickened thereby.

    This may be termed normal migration under ordinary weather con-

ditions.

     The duration of such favourable spells, however, is sooner or later
broken by the advent of a cyclonic period of a more or less severe type.
This interferes, to a greater or lesser degree, with the progress of the

migratory movements.

   --II. Extraordinary Weather Influences. These are exerted by the pre-

valence of particular weather conditions, which may act either (1) as

barriers to the ordinary movements, or (2) in diaraeti'ically the opposite
direction as incentives to great movements or ' rushes,' as they have been

termed.

     The weather barriers to bird-migration are unfavourable conditions of
a pronounced nature, which interrupt and make impossible, during their

prevalence, the ordinary seasonal movements.
     The weather incentives to migration are widely diflferent in their nature

and may take several forms. First, there may be favourable weather-
periods immediately following unfavourable periods. Secondly, they may

be due to weather in certain respects unfavourable to the birds, such as
a decided fall in temperature, which either compels the birds to move, or

acts as a warning that the time has arrived for their departure south-

wards. Such cold spells are characteristic of anticyclonio periods, when

the weather is calm and highly favourable for a prolonged flight.
Thirdly, and on the other hand, the advent in spring of a genial spell,
especially if accompanied by a rise of temperature, is an incentive to a
move to the northward for the summer haunts.

     The weather influences thus vary considerably ; but temperature
plays the most important part in the various seasonal movements, and is
the main controlling factor in all extraordinary movements, other
meteorological conditions being suitable. Each movement, however, has
its peculiarity, and the conditions controlling it are often due to meteoro-
logical phenomena of a more or less complex nature, most of which,
perhaps, admit of explanation.

   --Meteorology and AiUuimi Immigration. The immigratory movements

of the early autumn are those already mentioned as normal migration
under ordinary weather conditions, and need no further notice.
470 REPORT--1 896

     It is not until late in September, and during October and early
November, that the movements into our Islands from the north-east are
sufficiently pronounced to permit of their being associated with and
attributable to the great weather changes of the autumn. In ordinary
seasons the period named is characterised by a series of great immigratory

movements simultaneously performed not only by many species, but also
by a vast number of individuals.

     It has been ascertained that all these great movements are due to
the prevalence in north-western Europe of weather conditions favourable

--for emigration. These conditions are the result of the following type of

pressure distribution namely, the presence of a large and well-defined
anticyclone over the Scandinavian Peninsula, with gentle gradients ex-

tending in a south-westei'ly direction over the North Sea. On the other

hand, cyclonic conditions prevail to the westward of the British area,
with a low-pressure centre off the west coast of Ireland, or, though less
frequently, over areas further to the south. Under these pressure con-

ditions the weather is clear and cold, with light variable airs over Norway
and Sweden ; while in Britain the sky is overcast, and moderate to strong

easterly winds are experienced, with fog not unfrequently prevailing at

many east coast stations.
     The formation of these conditions in the autumn usually follows the

--passing away from Scandinavia the area in which the movement has its
--origin of a spell of a more or less pronounced cyclonic nature, during

the prevalence of which the ordinary course of the emigratory movements

 is either interrupted or rendered impossible.

      The effects of this sequence of meteorological conditions on bird

 migration are remarkable.
      During the cyclonic spell a weather barrier arrests the progress of,

and dams back as it were, the ordinary seasonal migratory stream.
These periods, too, are not unfrequently characterised by weather of
great ungeniaiity, and this, no doubt, gives the summer birds warning
that the time for seeking the south has arrived. Upon the duration and
 severity of these preliminary conditions depends, to some extent, the
 magnitude of the emigratory movement that follows.

      The formation of the anticyclone removes the cyclonic weather barrier,
 releases the flood, and provides conditions favourable for migration,
 adding also an incentive in the form of a decided fall in temperature.
 Thus it is not a matter for surprise that such a combination of meteoro-

 logical conditions in the north should produce a rush to the southwards of
 those vast numbers of migratory birds which appear during the hours of
 darkness on our eastern coasts at the fall of each year, and whose move-
 ments often extend over several successive nights.

      These great movements occur most frequently in October, but during
 that month in the year 1887 no such immigration was recorded for our

 coasts. On examining the Meteorological Record, it is found that this

 peculiar type of weather only prevailed for a few hours on the 9th, and
 that a marked immigratory movement immediately set in, only to be
 checked by the dispersal of the conditions necessary for a great emigration
 from North-Western Europe. This fact illustrates in a remarkable manner

 how very direct the bearing of these conditions is upon the great autumn
 migratory movements between Northern Europe and Eastern Great

 Britain.

      The movements just described take place when gentle pressure-
ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  471

gradients bridge, as it were, the North Sea, with fine weather between
Scandinavia and Britain. Such an extension, however^ of the favourable

--conditions does not always prevail for the entire journey that is to say,

they do not always reach to the British side of the North Sea. Indeed,
it not unfrequently happens that the birds reach our shores under more

or less unfavourable weather conditions. When such is the case the

immigrants arrive in Britain in a correspondingly exhausted condition,

and, no doubt, many sometimes perish during the journey. An exa-

mination of the weather data for such occasions reveals a very simple
explanation of this peculiar, and partially unfavourable, phase in

--Migration-Meteorology. It is as follows : Though the weather-condi-

tions at the area of departure be entirely favourable for emigration, and
induce the birds to move southwards, the conditions prevailing on the
British coast are unfavourable, oiving to the too close proximity or the

depth of the western lotv-pressure centre . On the location and character

of this cyclonic centre entirely depends the nature of the weather in the
immediate neighbourhood of our shores. If the western cyclonic system
is too close to Britain, or if the depression is exceptionally deep, then
unfavourable conditions for migration, with strong winds, prevail beyond

our eastern shores, and the birds perform the latter portion of their

journey under trying conditions. On the other hand, if it is ofiF our

western shores and shallow, then fine-weather gradients entirely bridge

the North Sea.
     Between these extremes of autumnal migration-weather there are

intermediate phases, whose influences are easily determined by a study of

the two sets of phenomena.
     The autumnal immigration from the east by the ' East and West

Route ' across the narrows of the North Sea to the south-east coast of

England remains to be considered in connection with its meteorological

aspects. Concerning this, however, there is not much to be explained.

It has been ascertained that the movements take place during favourable
weather conditions, and that they are most pronounced when the per-
fectly calm conditions and cold of anticyclonic periods prevail. They are

interrupted by rough weather, to be renewed with increased momentum

when the cyclonic spell is broken.

   --Simultaneous Autumn Immigration and Em,igration. It has been

mentioned in the Seasonal Section of this Report, that under certain con-
ditions in the late autumn decided immigratory and emigratory movements

are witnessed in progress simultaneously. On these not very frequent

occasions, it has been clearly ascertained that the anticyclone in North-
western Europe covers an unusually wide area. This is due to the gentle
character of its gradients, which, having their centre over Scandinavia,

extend in a south-westerly direction to and beyond the limits of the

British Isles. Thus there prevail over this exceptionally extensive region

all the conditions already described as favourable for great emigratory

movements. The result is a great simultaneous inpouring of birds on oui-
east coast and a general outpouring from all British coasts of migrants of
many species.

   --Aut2i7nn Emigration. The autumnal emigratory movements are con-

trolled, so far as they may be affected by meteorological phenomena, by

weather-conditions prevailing in the British area.

     The chief feature in migration during the earlier autumn days is the
departure of British summer birds, including those which have been
472 REPORT-- 1896.

described as partial migrants. During the prevalence of fine weather or
 of weather not ungenial for the time of the year, these emigrants slip
 away gradually and almost unobserved, except by those favourably

stationed on and olf our coasts, by whom land birds are only seen when

migrating. The pulse, so to speak, of these movements is, however, from
 time to time manifestly quickened under the influence of ungenial
weather conditions of a not too pronounced nature, the chief stimulant

 being a fall in the temperature.

     Even July, in certain seasons, has its ungenial spells, and so it was
 in the years 1882 and 1883, which were remarkable for their periods of
unseasonable weather. These outbursts make themselves felt on our
 feathered population, and result in movements of a partial nature, per-
 haps, but which have left their mark on the migration record. The
 weather influences inciting these incipient movements are a com-
 plete break-up of genial and normal conditions and the prevalence of
 unsettled conditions, not unfrequently accompanied by thunder and heavy
rains, and a decided fall in temperature. The result upon our summer
visitants, or it may be upon their young, is that many of them move from
 their accustomed haunts, and appear on the coast at the light stations

-- --sometimes at the lanterns where their occurrence is duly chronicled.

The species chiefly affected are the *Thrush, *Redbreast, Wheatear,
 *Whitethroat, Willow Warbler, Swallow, Martin, *Swift, and *Cuckoo.'

     During August the ordinary emigratory movements of the autumn

--set in, and are usually performed under ordinary conditions namely, fine

weather. The weather influences other than normal are the same un-
genial spells, especially if accompanied by cold, alluded to for July.
These, however, are not frequent in most seasons, and yet no season is
entirely free from them.

     With the great increase to emigration that characterises September,

there are recorded, usually on several occasions during the month, very

decided movements which may be fairly termed emigratory 'rushes.'
These occur simultaneously with the weather spells which, among other

characters, are remarkable for a decided fall in temperature, sometimes

amounting to many degrees. In one instance, on September 15, 1886,
the difference in temperature amounted to as much as 20° in twenty-four

hours, and naturally produced a marked effect in the emigration returns.
The conditions causing such decided falls in the thermometer, in the

great majority of instances, are northerly winds, and as these may be due

to anticyclonic weather conditions their force is usually slight. Some-
 times, however, these cold spells prevail with a light southerly wind.
This was the case on September 5, 1885, when a cold, showery period
caused much emigration. That low temperatures are the pi'ime factors is
clearly demonstrated by the September records ; inasmuch as during
this month there are unsettled periods which are not characterised by
cold, and it is found that their influence on migration is comparatively

insignificant. When the unsettled periods become very pronounced or

develop gales, which is sometimes the case during this month, the weather
barrier thus formed arrests the emigratory movements, which are ren-
dered impossible under such adverse conditions.

     The great autumnal emigratory movements, however, occur late in

     ' Those marked thus * are recorded as having been killed at the lanterns during
this month.
ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  473

September, during October, and early in November. These are the
result of the identical weather-conditions which cause similar emigratory

movements from northern Europe, except that the conditions favourable
for emigration prevail over the British area and to the southwards, and
do not extend northwards. Indeed, the movement is usually kept quite
distinct from an immigration by the interposition of weather barriers to
the north, which cut off migratory communication between our shores
and those of north-western Europe. These barriers most frequently take
the form of a subsidiary low-pressure area lying over the North Sea
between Great Britain and Scandinavia.

      These great emigrations from Britain and Ireland, like the great immi-
grations from northern Europe at the same season, set in on tlie passing
away of the cyclonic conditions unfavourable for bird-migration, and on
the prevalence of an anticyclonic, or fine weather, spell with its charac-
teristic calm and cold. In this case, too, the unfavourable conditions

which have passed away probably act as a warning to many laggards
among the migratory birds, while the cold adds an additional spur and

swells the ranks of the departing birds.

     During October movements are observed locally, which are directly
traceable to the influence exerted on emigration by a considerable lower-
ing of the temperature over a particular area. Thus, for example, on
October 20, 1883, there was a remarkable movement of Swallows to the

south-east coast of Ireland. On this day there was a decided fall in

temperature, the lowest readings being recorded for Ireland, where these

laggard summer-birds had until then found congenial quarters.
     Again, on October 10, 1885, a local movement to the southward

of Thrushes and Blackbirds was recorded at stations in the north of

Scotland, and in this instance, too, the meteorological data afford the
information that a fall in temperature had occurred within that area.

     The emigratory movements in the late autumn and winter are, as has

been already stated in this Report, attributable to the direct pressure of
severe weather-conditions, in the shape of frost or heavy snow. It has
been said, too, that these movements on the part of our resident and

visitant birds are renewed with each outburst of cold, &c., during Novem-

--ber, December, January, February, and early March in some years down

to the third week of the latter month. Little more need be said regard-

ing these simple weather influences on British bird-emigration.
      In certain years, however, the months of midwinter are characterised by

conditions of Arctic severity. The January of 1881 was the most terrible

month of the period covered by the inquiry. During its severe days many

hundreds of birds perished even in the climatically most favourably

--situated portions of the British area namely, the isles off the south-west

coast of Ireland. The dominant feature of this month was intense cold,
which for about three weeks reigned supreme in all parts of the British
area, and was accompanied by severe, harsh gales and heavy snow.

Thus, in spite of an exceptionally warm period during the month,
the mean temperature for this January was from 5° to 12° below the

average.

   --Spring/ Imvxigration. In connection with the spring immigration,

two very remarkable instances occurred on February 17, 1887. On this

day several Wheatears arrived at the Chicken's Rock Lighthouse, and a
Ring Ouzel was observed and shot at the Longship station. This date is

--exceptionally early for these species indeed, they are the earliest records
474 REPORT-- 1896.

registered for any spring migrants during the eight years of the inquiry.

It is noteworthy to iind, from the ' Daily Weather Report,' that this

portion of the British area was the warmest spot in Western Europe on

the date in question.

During genial intervals in March, summer birds arrive, the AVheateai'

appearing some years in considerable numbers. In 1884, during a

prolonged spell of warm weather, exceeding in warmth anything recorded

for very many years, which followed a period of shai-p frosts and snow,

no fewer than six species of spring migrants were recorded as arriving in

our Islands. Again, in 1886, five species were noted for a similar genial

period. On the other hand, in the cold wintry March of 1883 one summer-

-- --bird alone the Wheatear was noted. Another March colder than the

average was experienced in 1885, during which the arrival of three species

only was chronicled.

Since the first arrivals of the summer birds appear, as a rule, in March,

it may here be remarked that the climatic peculiarities of the British area

would appear to play an important part in the geographical distribution

of these early immigrants.

The remarkable fact that the great majority of the summer visitors to

our Islands are first observed on the shores of the south-west of England

and Ireland, has already been mentioned. This holds good even in

ordinary and genial seasons, but in cold ones it is almost entirely the

case. Thus in March, 1887, with its monotonously low temperature, the

arrival of six species was recorded on twelve occasions, all for the south-

-- --west. During the exceptionally cold and rough March of 1883, only one

species the Wheatear was observed on two occasions, both at stations

on the west coast of Ireland where the temperature was highest. Again,

in the cold March of 188.5 every record but one of the fourteen chronicled

was made in this same mild region of the British area.

It must not, however, be supposed that the thermometric conditions

prevailing in our Islands are the cause of the northward movements to

WeBritain and Ireland in the spring.  must seek their cause in weather

conditions and influences prevailing and acting in regions to the south of

our Islands.

   A careful comparison has been made between the migrational and

meteorological phenomena in connection with these spring emigratory

movements from the continent. As the result it has invariably been found

that all such movements, except those performed late in the season, are to

be correlated with a rise of temperature in south-western Europe and

perhaps in northern Africa. That this induces the birds to embark on

their northward journey does not admit of doubt. It is worthy of note

that in not a few instances such movements are recorded for dates on

which the temperature in our Islands was lower than immediately before

the immigration. This clearly indicates that the increase of warmth at

the seat of emigration is the main factor controlling the spring move-

ments to the north. This rise in temperature in south-western Europe

may, and sometimes does, extend to and prevail over the British Isles.

Apart from this simple phenomenon no other peculiar meteorological

condition appears to be associated with these spring movements from

--southern Europe to the British Islands.
     Spring Emigration from Britain. The movements of birds from our

Islands to the northern breeding grounds in spring are influenced by the

weather conditions which prevail in the British area, as all our emigratory
ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  47 -J

movements naturally are. That such is the case is manifest on a com-
parison being instituted between the migrational and the meteorological

data for spring. Here, as abroad, it is found, other conditions being

equal, that increase in temperature is the main influencing factor, and
also that upon it depends, to a considerable degree, the extent of the

movement.
     The emigratory movements from Great Britain and Ireland naturally

take place at later dates than the corresponding movements into our
Islands from the south. Thus it is not until April, and especially May,
that the decided or great departure movements are recorded which are
relevant to the particular investigation under consideration.

     In April the tine weather or anticyclonic periods have varying emigra-
tional values, depending entirely on their temperature. They are favourable

if characterised by high, or moderately high, temperatures ; or they may

be distinctly unfavourable through their decided cold. There is, however,

a medium even in the influence of anticyclonic spells, and thus during
periods which are moderately cold but calm, some emigration, of a

straggling nature it is true, is recorded.
      In spring, too, cyclonic periods vary also in their influences on emi-

gration. They are, as a rule, unfavourable owing to their high winds

and ungeniality. On the other hand, when they are of a mild type and
characterised by warm rain and soft breezes, following a cold anticyclonic

spell in April, they are found to be distinctly favourable to a northward
movement from our Islands.

      The great spring emigratory flights, and most of the lesser ones too,
are embarked upon under precisely the same type of pressure distribution
as that described as being so markedly favourable for the autumn passage
of birds across the North Sea to our Islands, namely, the presence of a
high pressure centre to the north-east of our Islands over Norway and
Sweden, with gentle gradients to the south-west. Under such circum-
stances of pressure distribution the North Sea between our Islands and
the Scandinavian peninsula is spanned by fine weather, and moderate
easterly or southerly bi-eezes prevail. Such highly favourable periods, as
in the autumn, usually follow spells of weather decidedly ungenial for

bird migration.

     Some of these spring movements to the north are occasionally

undertaken during somewhat unfavourable weather. Even in May

there are a few records of emigration during sleet, cold rain, and north-
east breezes, but it has to be explained that these flights followed
prolonged spells of ungenial weather, with decidedly low temperature,
late in the season, and were genial when compared with the preceding

conditions.

   -- --Late in the spring at the end of May and in June it is not surprising

to find that meteorological influences do not play an important part in
the last movements to the north. That this should be the case is due,
 no doubt, to the advanced state of the season and its settled, or com-

 paratively settled, weather.

   --Winds. The importance attached to winds in connection with bird-

 migration has hitherto been much over-estimated by popular writers, and

 their influence, such as it is, misunderstood.

      The conclusions to be drawn from a careful study of the subject are :
 (1) that the direction of the wind has no influence whatever as an
                                                                      --

476 REPORT-- 1896.

incentive to migration ; but that (2) its force is certainly an important

factor, inasmuch as it may make migi'ation an impossibility, arrest to a

greater or lesser degree its progress, or even blow birds out of their

course. AVe have the clearest proof, indeed, that birds do not emigrate

when the winds are exceptionally high, though they sometimes pass into

high winds and gales when en route, under the meteorological conditions

--which have already been described and explained. Ordinary winds that

--is, winds not too strong appear to be of small concern to the birds, for

they are recorded as migrating with winds blowing from all quarters.

It is, however, a fact that particular winds almost invariably prevail

during the great autumnal movements, and these have hitherto been con-

sidered by some as the direct incentives to such migrations. Such is not the

case, and it may be at once stated that these supposed favourable breezes

are simply another direct result of the pressure distribution favourable

to the movements. This peculiar type of weather has already been fully

described and its effects discussed ; the winds prevailing and dependent
upon these barometric conditions are easterly, chiefly south-easterly

breezes. There is really no reason why westerly (west, north-west, and

south-west) winds, not too strong of course, should not, other things being

equal, be in every way as suitable for migratory movements as those

varying between such divergent points as north-east to south. When,

however, we come to inquire into the meteorological conditions producing

these westerly winds, the reason for their unsuitability becomes at once

apparent. These winds are the result of types of pressure-disti'ibutiun

which are fatal to migration between north-western Europe and Britain,

namely, the presence of cyclonic areas to the north-east or east of the

British Isles. This means that the area under disturbed conditions would

be the very region from which v.'e derive our autumn immigrants and

render emigration from such sources impossible. Such areas of disturb-

ance, with their high westerly and north-westerly winds, indeed, often

extend to and influence the weather in our Islands, and interfere with

the British emigratory movements in both autumn and spring.

Strong winds have a curious eftect on the flight of Gulls, compelling

them to move in a direction more or less directly heading the wind. Thus

a strong westerly wind causes great numbers of Gulls to seek the estuaries

and bays of our east coast. On the other hand, strong easterly winds

will fill the estuaries and sea-lochs of the west coasts with these birds.

The lee side of islands is also sought under similar conditions of the

Awind.  south-easterly wind, for the same reason, causes considerable

numbers of Gulls of various species to pass southward along the eastern

coast of Britain. Large parties of Gulls are also recorded as passing N.

--sometimes for a whole day with a N.N.W. wind. These movements are

more or less local, and the birds return, no doubt, to their regular haunts

in a few hours' time. They are, moreover, chiefly observed in the autumn.

   --Gales. One effect of gales has already been alluded to, namely, that

they arrest or make impossible the migratory movements.
    At sea, however, they have a direct influence on the migrations of

certain marine species, such as Skuas, Phalaropes, Petrels, ifcc. These

birds in the autumn are occasionally driven out of their course by severe
gales, and appear on our coasts in exceptional numbei's. At such times,

     Fog. It often happens that during an important migratory move-

ment in the autumn or winter, fog prevails. On such occasions more

birds than usual approach the lanterns of the light- stations and are
killed, sometimes in considerable numbers, by striking against the glass.
This phenomenon is another effect of those anticyclonic spells which
have been mentioned as favourable to and causing emigration, and it is
thus not surprising that the birds should encounter foggy weather

during their movements. Such atmospheric conditions are well known to

meteorologists to be characteristic of these high -pressure systems, and of
their frosty periods, which latter are also the chief cause of the winter
movements.

     There is also some direct evidence that birds lose themselves in foggy
weather, since practically non-migratory species, such as Sparrows, appear
during its prevalence at unusual seasons at stations just off the coast.

                         Conclusion.

In conclusion it remains to be stated that this is merely a Sum-

mary of the Results obtained from a careful study of the data. It is

not claimed for the Digest that it is exhaustive in any department.

Indeed, such is far from being the case, and it is recognised that much yet

remains to be extracted from the enormous mass of information now

reduced to order. Further research will, no doubt, yield results of a

useful, if not an important nature.

It has been found impossible here to enter into many interesting

details in connection with the facts now established, while a vast amount

of useful information of a statistical nature awaits publication. Much of

the latter, however, can only be treated of under the numerous species to

which it relates.

To the further consideration of the data, with a view to obtaining

mypossible new and interesting facts, I am still actively devoting  atten-

tion. I trust in due course to make a more detailed and supplementary

communication on Bird-migration in the British Islands, and on the inter-

relationship existing between it and the various other phenomena with

which it is associated.

The Table in the Naples Zoological Station hired by the British Associa-

tion has been occupied during the past year, under the sanction of your
Committee, by Mr. H. Chas. Williamson, whose objects of research were
(a) the life-history of the eel and (b) the absorption of the yolk, and other
points in the development of pelagic teleostean ova. Mr. Williamson's
investigations extended from August 15, 1895, to July 16, 1896, with
two intervals of absence for the purpose of prosecuting observations in
other localities in connection with these researches. The nature of the
work undertaken is indicated in the report furnislied by Mr. Williamson,
which is appended.

    An application for jjermission to use the Table during the ensuing

year has been received from Mr. M. D. Hill, who wishes to investigate

the ova of certain Hydrozoa.

     Your Committee trust that the General Committee will sanction the
payment of the grant of 100/., as in previous years, for the hire of the

Table in the Zoological Station at Naples.
     Early in the coming year the Naples Zoological Station will celebi-ate

its twenty-fifth anniversary, the foundation-stone having been laid in April
1872. The occasion will be one of special interest, as it marks a period
dui'ing which about 1,000 naturalists of various nations have worked at
Naples, and more than thirty smaller institutions have sprung into

existence elsewhere. It is not too much to say that the Naples Station,

as their forerunner, has entirely changed the conditions of marine ])iolo-

gical study.

    As evidence of the successful management of the undertaking, it is

sufficient to refer to the steady development and extension of scope
recorded year by year, as well as to the constantly increasing popularity
of the Naples Station as an international centre for research. That this
feeling is actively maintained is shown by the fact that since the last
report the Smithsonian Institute has renewed its contract with the Station
for a term of years, and that new tables have been taken by the Columbia

College of New York, as well as by Roumania and Bulgaria. The

University of Strassburg has also renewed its contract for five years.
     During the past year the two steamers belonging to the Station have

been repaired and improved at a cost of 20,000 francs, and a new com-
pound engine by Thornycroft has been bought for 10,000 francs. Other
improvements and additions to the general equipment of the station, too
numerous to mention here, have also been made.

    The small zoological station established on the island of New Britain

(mentioned in your Committee's last report) has been developing slowly,

under the auspices of the Naples Station. The German Colonial Office
and the Berlin Academy have recently granted 250^. and 150^. respec-

tively for the purpose of sending out Dr. Dahl, of Kiel, to investigate the
fauna, both terrestrial and marine.

     The progress of the various publications undertaken by the station is
summarised as follows :

I. Report on the Occuj)ation of tlie Table. By Mr. H. Chas.

                                       Williamson.

     During 1895-9G, for three separate periods of three months each,
I have been engaged in the study of (a) the life-history of the eel and
{h) the absorption of the yolk, and other points in the development of

pelagic teleostean ova.

(a) On the Life-history of the Eel.

In connection with this subject, I have been enabled to examine the

large eggs first described by Raffiiele,^ and referred by that author with

reservation to the family of the Mursenidse, a diagnosis which has since

Areceived support from Grassi.^  large number of elveos and of eels of

various sizes above that stage were supplied me during the winter. In

the intervals between the periods of occupation of the Table I was absent

from Naples in connection with this research.

        (b) On the Absorption of the Yolk in Pelagic Teleostean Ova.

     The process of the absorption of the yolk in teleostean ova is not one
which has received much direct attention. In demersal eggs the absorp-
tion of the yolk is mainly effected by means of an elaborate vitelline
blood circulation. In pelagic ova, with one or two rare exceptions, it is
stated generally no vitelline circulation exists. The study of this subject
involves an examination almost solely of live eggs. I find that, in a

480 REPORT-- 1896.

number of pelagic ova which I have been able to examine, there is a

distinct, though very much modified, vitelline circulation. The elements

of this circulation are not, however, blood corpuscles, but yolk corpuscles.

In the ova of eic/ht species · I found this circulation, the corpuscles of

which are derived from the periblast. Contemporaneously with the

--formation of the heart have appeared the primary vessels viz. (a) the

two lateral arteries uniting to form the median trunk, which passes

posteriorly a  point  a  little short of  the tip of  the tail                           (6)  the primitive
                                                                                      ;

caudal vein, which debouches into the posterior end of the yolk-sac. The

pulsations of the heart are at first feeble and slow. The venous end of

Athe heart is open to the interior of the yolk-sac.   few corpuscles are

now seen to pass from the yolk-sac into the heart. These corpuscles,

which proceed singly and at intervals, are seen moving along the arterial

trunks to the tail, and immediately thereafter appear in the caudal vein,

from which they pass into the yolk-sac. They then, with varying speed,

pass over the ventral surface of the yolk and enter the heart. Some of

the corpuscles proceed directly from the posterior end of the yolk-sac to

the heart without ; others become attached to the periblast, and remain

fast for longer or shorter intervals. On the posterior surface of the yolk,

where the caudal vein enters the yolk-sac, the periblast shows a well-

marked furrow, which has been worn in it by the circulating fluid.

Before the heart begins to beat, corpuscles, similar to the later

circulating corpuscles, are seen on the periblast, and that these cor-

puscles, derived from the periblast, become the circulating corpuscles

there is no doubt. At first, and even up to the time of hatching, the

corpuscles are few in number. Only in the case of the three species of

the eggs of Murjenidse have I been able to study the circulation fully.

Eggs of other species which I examined presented difficulties, owing to

their small size, presence of oil globules, or on account of the supply of

specimens being insufficient. Only in the case of two species, in addition

to those of the Mursenidse, was I able to obtain the ova in abundance.

The corpuscles are minute, irregular in shape and size. In certain of the

eggs the presence of the corpuscles on the periblast, and in motion in the

yolk-sac, the connection between the caudal vein and yolk-sac, and the

furrow continuing the caudal vein on the periblast have been regarded as

sufficient evidence that a circulation of yolk corpuscles, similar to that
Aclearly followed in others, was present.
                                                      certain amount of yolk-

absorption no doubt takes place at the parts of the embryo in connection

with the yolk, but after the formation of the tail of the embryo that

absorption is probably very slight. The heart of the embiyo in a pelagic

ovum is said to pulsate before any blood is present, but the heart is not,

however, without a circulation. It is extremely probable that there is, in

addition to the yolk corpuscles, a circulating fluid of some sort being

directed through the vessels by the heart. The first corpuscles are then

formed in the periblast, and pass into the circulating fluid, the existence
Aof which it is not unreasonable to postulate.
                                                      second method of adding

corpuscles to the circulation is shown in a number of ova. This is a

process of budding from the periblast. Slender pseudopodium-like pro-

cesses are thrown out from the surface of the periblast, and from the tips
of these processes are budded off corpuscles which enter the heart and the
·circulation. These processes have been noticed by several authors, among

others by Ryder. I have been able to observe these processes in the eggs
of seven species. The eggs of the Murasnidte, from their large size, offer
facilities for the study of this process of budding, and in these eggs the

difi'erent stages have been successfully followed. TJie process is very

slow, and may easily be overlooked. In the other species, the ova of

which are small, the presence of the pseudopodial processes was noted.
In these, unless a large number of eggs is obtainable, it is almost impos-
sible to follow the actual budding off of the corpuscle. The corpuscles

derived from the process of budding do not appear to differ from the
primary corpuscles derived from the periblast. They are irregular in
shape and size, and show, at least in some cases, nuclei. There is thus,

previous to the advent of the blood circulation, a circulation of corpuscles

derived from the periblast in two ways, (1) by simple direct transference

from the surface of the periblast                                                                                           (2)  transference by means of  a process

of budding.

    That the processes mentioned above are general I am led to belie^-e
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

lout I have not yet had the opportunity of examining a sufficient number

of species to enable me to make a generalised statement.

( Other points in development, which occupied my attention at Naples,

T must leave over until I have had an opportunity of continuing my

observations.

    Any reference on my part to the advantages afforded by the Zoological

Station at Naples is quite uncalled for. This subject has more than once

been treated by zoologists more competent to judge than I am. To me

the opportunity given by the Committee of the British Association to

occupy the Table at Naples has been of incalculable value, and my sincere

thanks are offered for the honour so done me.

--African Lake Fauna. Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr.

    P. L. SCLATER (Chairman), Dr. John Murray, Professor E. Ray

    Lankester, Professor W. A. Herdman, and Professor G. B.
     Howes (Secretary).

On reaching Blantyre, Mr. T. E. Moore, to whom the Committee had

entrusted the investigation of the fauna of Lake Tanganyika, being

detained by the Nyasa war, took the opportunity of visiting Lake

Shirwa, and made observations upon a Green Bacterium, which appears

to swarm there. Proceeding subsequently to Tanganyika, he reports that

the fresh-water Medusa there (Limnoclida tanganyikce) is exceedingly

abundant, and announces the discovery of an apparent dimorphism in

certain specimens, with active proliferation of each of the dimorphic

Heforms.        has also collected fishes, molluscs, Crustacea, and plants, all

of which bear out the conclusion that Lakes Tanganyika and Nyasa are

quite distinct in origin, and has discovered a large fresh-water sponge.

Mr. Moore has also made geological collections, with a special view to

their bearings upon the origin of the great African Lakes. After visiting

some of the smaller lakes, he proposes shortly to start on his return

journey to this country. Under these circumstances the Committee pro-

pose to defer their final report on the results arrived at by Mr. Moore

until the next meeting of the Association, and ask that they may be

reappointed in the meanwhile without any further grant.
ON THE LABORATORY OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. 485

--Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Plymouth. Report of

     the Committee, consisting of Mr. G. C. Bourne (Chairman), Pro-
    fessor E. Ray Lankester (Secretary), Professor M. Foster, and

     Professor S. H. Vines, appointed to investigate the Relations
     between Physical Conditions and Marine Fauna and Flora.

Algological Notes for Plymouth District. By Mr. George Brebner.

From January to April (1896) inclusive I had the privilege of occupying

the British Association's table. As a result of my investigations the

following marine algae were added to the local flora, several of which were
new to Britain, and others (marked thus *) were species or forms new to

science.

          NEW TO BRITAIN.

          Myxophyce^.

Oscillatoria rosea, Cm. (Queen's Ground.)
Symploca atlantica, Gom. f. purpurea, Batt. (Yealm.)

Hyella ccespitosa. Born, et Flah. var. nitida, Batt.

          PHiEOPHYCEiE.

Ralfsia disciformis (Cm.), Batt. (Yealm.).

                                           Floride^.

*Acrochcetiu7n endophyticum, Batt. (Off west end of breakwater.)

 Cruoria rosea. Cm. f. purpurea, Batt. (Yealm.)

  Cruorioj)sis cruciata, Duf. (Queen's Ground.)
  Cruoriopsis Hauckii, Batt. (Off west end of breakwater.)

 Peyssonelia rupestris, Cm. (Queen's Ground.)

          NEW TO PLYMOUTH DISTRICT.

                                   Chlorophyce^.
Cladophora hirta, Kiitz. (Drake's Island.)

          PH.EOPHYCEiE.

       Lithoderma fatiscens, Aresch. (Bovisand Bay). (Plurilocular spo-
rangia not previously found in Britain.)

          Floride^.

       Acrochcetiuni microscopicum. Nag.
       Peyssonelia Harveyana, Crn. (Queen's Ground.)
       Rhododermis elegans, Crn. (Queen's Ground, &c.)
       Lithothamnion Stromfeltii, Foslie. (Queen's Ground.)

      Peyssonelia Rosenvingii Schm. (Wembury Bay.)

    The new species of Acrochcetiuni is interesting on account of the main

--part of the thallus being endophytic namely, in Dasya coccinea (Huds).
--Ag. this alga therefore occupying in the genus Acrochmtium a position

analogous to that of Rhodochorton membranaceiun Magn. in its genus.
A. endophyticum, Batt., was described in the barren condition at the
Linnean meeting of December 19, 1895, but the monosporangia were not
found till January 1896.
480 KEPORT-- 1896.

Cruoria rosea, Cm. f. purpurea, Batt., is probably only a more ad-

vanced stage in the life-history of Cruoria rosea, Crn., than had hitherto

been recognised. It is so like the figure of Crouan's Cruoria purpurea

that it would iave been identified as such by Mr. Edw. Batters and

myself but for the fact that our solitary specimen showed several inter-

mediate connecting stages.

Crtwriojjsis Hauckii, Batt., is an interesting member of the

SquamariacesB, obtained from a stone dredged off the west end of the

breakwater. The tetraspores showed almost every transition from zonate

to cruciate. It most nearly resembles Cruoriella annorica of Hauck

(non Crouan). As one of the two species bearing the name Cruoriella

armorica will have to be renamed, Mr. Batters proposes to call our

plant as above.

The other finds do not call for special mention.

Interesting results were obtained from a cultivation experiment with

Ahn/eltia plicata, Fr. The nature of its fructification has not been

satisfactorily made out. The late Professor Fr. Schmitz maintained that

it was a parasite {Sterrocolax decipiens, Schm.), and that the true repro-

ductive organs had not yet been found. His view, however, while widely

accepted by algologists, was opposed by Reinke and othei's. This plant,

richly supplied with 'nemathecia,' was placed in sterilised sea-water on

February 1, 1896, and after two months (March 30) a very great number

of germinated spores, in the shape of small discs, were found on the sides

of the glass jar. The structure and appearance of those discs were such as

to strongly support the view that the supposed parasite of Schmitz was in

reality the sporogenic nemathecium, or fructification, of Ahnfeltia plicata.

Unfortunately, owing to the difficulties of cultivation, I did not succeed

in definitely settling this point, as the culture did not get beyond the disc

stage                     but, if  the  opportunity  offers, another  year  I  hope to repeat this
                       ;

experiment under more favourable conditions.

As part of my investigation J am studying the attaching-discs of the

red sea-weeds, or Floridese, in order to ascertain to what extent the

-- --conditions found by me in Dumontia Jiliformis (Fl. Dan.) Grev. (' Journal

of the Linnean Soc' Botany vol. xxx. p. 436) prevail in other species. So
far I have found no other red sea- weed which shows a mode of development,

from an attaching-disc, similar to that described for D. Jiliformis (1. c).

A large number of the Floridete (e.g. Gigartiria, Polyides, Stenogramme) are

connected with their attaching disc by a simple parenchyma-like tissue
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

one or two species of those which have attaching discs present somewhat

diflPerent features, and when their structure is more fully worked out will

be worth describing and figuring, but they in no way resemble the con-

ditions found in D. Jiliformis.

In conclusion I should like to state that two or three of the above

finds are entirely due to Mr. Batters, the material having simply been

forwarded to him from the Laboratory at my request. He, moreover, has

very kindly acted as expert for me by naming such algae as seemed to
me to be interesting or new, the Plymouth Marine Biological Laboratory

not being well supplied with the literature necessary for algological

research.

The diagnosis of -4 cr. endophyticum, Batt., and particulars with regard

to the other new to Britain marine algse, may be found in ' The Journal of

Botany' for September, 1896, under 'New or Critical British Sea-weeds,'

by Mr. Edw. Batters.
ON THE BIOLOGY OF OCEANIC ISLANDS.  487

--TJie Necessity for the Immediate Investigation of the Biology of Oceanic
     Islands. Report of the Goonmittee, consisting of Sir W. H.
     Flower {Chairman), Professor A. C. Haddon {Secretary), Mr.
     Gr. C. Bourne, Dr. H. 0. Forbes, Professor W. A. Herdman, Dr.
      John Murray, Professor A. Newton, Mr. A. E. Shipley, and,
     Professor W. F. R. Weldon. {Drawn up by the Secretary.)

Those students of Botany, Zoology, and Anthropology who have at all

considered the matter, are impressed with the fact that the present time

is a very critical period for the native flora and fauna of many parts of
the world. Owing to the spread of commerce, the eflfects of colonisation,
and the intentional or accidental importation of plants and animals, a very

rapid change is affecting the character of the indigenous life of numerous
districts. This is notably the case in oceanic islands, the area of which is
often extremely limited, and whose native forms have been found to be
specially liable to be swamped by the immigrants ; but it is just those spots
which are of especial interest to the naturalist, on account of their isola-

tion from the great land areas. Thus the flora and fauna of many of the

most interesting districts for the field-naturalist are in our day becoming
largely exterminated before they have been adequately recorded. The
Committee, while fully recognising that it is unwise to compare the rela-
tive values of different branches of science, are strongly of opinion that
the naturalists of a future date will have a just cause of complaint against

us if we have not done our best to save to science a record of these
vanishing forms. Certain branches of enquiry may safely be left to the
next generation, but the investigation of disappearing animals and plants

--can, in many cases, be undertaken by us alone and even now much has

disappeared and more is fast passing away. It is, perhaps, scarcely neces-
sary to point out that this investigation is not a matter of interest to
the systematist only, but it is of great importance in connection with the
problems of geographical distribution, variation, adaptation to the environ-
ment, and the like.

   We need only refer to the Reports of the Committee on the Zoology

of the Sandwich Islands, and those of the Committee of the Zoology and

Botany of the West India Islands, to show that some work is being done
in this direction by the British Association and other scientific societies,
but we would urge that much more should be done by the Governments,
scientific societies and private individuals of this and other countries.

     Mr. Perkins' investigations in the Hawaiian group prove that quite a
noticeable decrease in the indigenous fauna is taking place each season.
The district around Honolulu was perhaps originally the richest in
endemic forms, but now introduced forms are in vast preponderance ; the
distinctive fauna of the plains, if there was one, has quite disappeared.
Captain Cook found certain birds, for example, near the shore ; of these,
some are extinct, and others are to be found only in the mountains. The
area of the whole group is somewhat larger than Yorkshire. If the
diminution of the fauna is so marked in such a comparatively large group
as the Hawaiian Islands, how much greater must it be in the small

islands.
483 REPORT--1896.

Mr. Knight, in the ' Cruise of the Falcon,' describes the prostrate

Weforests of the island of Trinidad in the South Atlantic.  never can

know what was the nature and extent of this vanished flora and fauna.

What is taking place in the small islands holds good to a somewhat

less extent for the larger ones. In New Zealand the Government is

taking steps to preserve certain well-known vestiges of its ancient fauna,

which are in imminent danger of extermination ; but it does not interest

itself in the inconspicuous forms, which are subject to the same danger,

nor does the New Zealand Government systematically investigate the

existing fauna of the group.

     It is necessary that such investigations should be undertaken by a

competent naturalist. He should not only be a good collector, but a keen

observer, in fact, a naturalist in the true sense of the term ; for unless
the work is well done it had almost be better left undone. There are

many examples of collecting being so imperfectly done as to lead to very-

erroneous conclusions. It takes time for a naturalist to become acquainted

with the local types. The endemics do not show themselves, as usually

the conditions of life are such that insects, for example, live retired

lives and are not seen, while those that manifest themselves are oftert

foreigners.

     The extermination of animal life is more rapid and striking than that
of plants, but what has been stated for animals must be applied to plants-

as well.

     Not less important than the foregoing is the study of the anthropology

of these districts. The Tasmanians have entirely disappeared and we
know extremely little about this interesting people. In many islands the

natives are fast dying out, and in more they have become so modified by

contact with the white man and by crossings due to deportation by

Europeans, that immediate steps are necessary to record the anthropo-

logical data that remain. Only those who have a personal acquaintance
with Oceania, or those who have carefully followed the recent literature-

of the subject, can have an idea of the pressing need there is for prompt

action. No one can deny that it is our bounden duty to record the

physical characteristics, the handicrafts, the psychology, ceremoniaV

observances and religious beliefs of vanishing peoples ; this also is a work
which in many cases can alone be accomplished by the present generation.

    There is no difficulty in finding men competent to undertake such

investigations if the funds were forthcoming. For the Committee to
satisfactorily organise any expedition it would be necessary to have a per-
manent income or at all events an adequate amount for a defined number

of years. Experience has shown that an annual sum of 400/. is necessary
to equip and maintain one naturalist.

     The Coinmittee ask to be reappointed, and hope to propose a definite
scheme at the next meeting of the Association.

      Since the above was in print Dr. D. Sharp has received a letter from
 Mr. Perkins, in which the following passage occurs : this is so appropriate

--that we do not hesitate to quote it in full : ' The country where I camped

here (Lihue, Kauai) was a low-lying, densely covered forest bogland, at

first sight a paradise for Carabidse, and differing from any other place

known to me. Its fauna is entirely lost for ever.

     ' I turned during my stay thousands of logs, any one of which at

4,000 feet would have yielded Carabidse. Of all these there was not a

single one under whicli Plieidole megacephala had not a nest, and I never
beat a tree without this ant coming down in scores. The only endemic
insects seen were two earwigs, which appear to be (as I had already found
out on Oahu and Maiu) the only native insects which can resist the ant.

It was hardly possible for me to reach the ground behind the forest, but
when I did get beyond the ant on one occasion, in pouring rain, I got

some native beetles.' July 21, 1896.

--Index Genermn et Specierum Animalium. Report of a Committee,

    consisting of Sir W. H. Flower {Chairman), Mr. P. L. Sclater,

Dr. H. Woodward, and Mr. F. A. Bather (Secretary), ajypointecl

for superintending the Compilation of an Index Genermn et

Speciemm Animalium.                                          f

In consequence of Mr. W. L. Sclater leaving England for South Africa,

your Committee has added to its number Mr. F. A. Bather, who has

served as secretary. During this past year considerable interest has been

aroused in this work in connection both with the synopsis of species of

living animals proposed to be issued by the German Zoological Society,

under the title ' Das Tierreich,' and with the scheme for a subject cata-

logue of scientific literature discussed at the recent International Congress

on scientific bibliography. The importance of this work has been acknow-

ledged by the British Association Committee on Zoological Bibliography

and Publication, and a resolution bearing on the subject will be found in
Athe Report of that Committee.
                                paper entitled ' Explanation of the

Plan adopted for preparing the Index Generum et Specierum Animalium '

was read by Mr. Sherborn before the Zoological Society on June 2, and
will be published in its ' Proceedings.' To this paper those who require

detailed information on the present condition of the work may be referred.

Since the commencement of this work in 1890, a total of 130,000 refer-

ences has been accumulated in duplicate, and a mass of literature has

been carefully and thoroughly indexed. The time available for the work

has amounted to about three years, and the whole work has been done by

Mr. C. Davies Sherborn, the compiler. Every reference slip is at once

sorted into its alphabetical order under the Genus, and the MS. is acces-

sible at the British Museum (Natural History) for daily reference. The

Museum Authorities furnish cabinets and accommodation for the MS.,

Aand the work is also carried on in that building.  considerable number

of bibliographic researches of value have been made, the fixation of the

dates of publication being regarded as of prime importance.

    Your Committee has requested Mr. Sherborn to conduct his work in
such a manner that the Index should be published in three parts, dealing

with the literature from 1758 to 1800, 1800 to 1850, 1850 to 1900,
respectively, and to complete the first of these parts as quickly as

possible.

Your Committee begs to urge upon the Association the importance of

completing this work at as early a date as possible, and venture to recom-
mend that it be reappointed with a grant of £100, so that Mr. Sherborn

may be provided with some secretarial assistance.

490 REPORT-- 1896.

--Zoological Bibliography and Publication. Report of the Committee,

    consisting of Sir W. H. Flower (Chairman), Professor W. A.
    Herdman, Mr, W. E. Hoyle, Dr. P. L. Sclater, Mr. Adam

      Sedgwick, Dr. D. Sharp, Mr. C. D. Sherborn, Rev. T. R. R.

    Stebbing, Professor W. F. R. Weldon, and Mr. F. A. Bather

       (Secretary).

In consequence of the International Conference on scientific bibliography

convened by the Royal Society, and held from July 14 to 17, your Com-
mittee has deferred expressing any opinion with regard to questions
of international co-operation or the use of any system of numerical

nota^on.

     With a view of obtaining a body of opinion to guide it in its decision,
your Committee is circulating among various experts, both British and

foreign, not included in the Committee, the following questions :

(A) The first questions to be decided are those of Publication, since a

bibliography cannot be compiled till it is settled what is to be included.

     (1) What constitutes publication ? It is suggested that private pre-
sentation by the author is not publication, but that the work must be

Anobtainable by any individual through ordinary trade channels.

exception must be made in the case of reports and bulletins issued by

public bodies gratis to all bonajide applicants, since some of these are not

allowed to be sold.

(2) What is the date ofjmblication ? If private presentation be dis-

regarded, as suggested, then the date of private distribution of an author's

separate copies cannot be accepted ; neither can we accept the date of the

reading of a paper before a learned society, or even that of the issue of

an abstract thereof to the fellows of such society.

    (3) As a corollary to the above, it was recognised at the meeting on
May 7, that the issue of authors^ separate copies before the issue of the

complete volume leads to confusion. Various reasons, however, seem to

render this pi-actice a common one, and it is desirable that some remedy

should be found. It would be possible either to issue each paper or

memoir as soon as printed, with separate pagination and in a separate

wrapper, as done by the Royal Society and the Swedish Royal Academy

of Science ; or to issue the volumes sheet by sheet, as matter might come

to hand and be printed. On this any suggestions would be very welcome.

     (4) Is it advisable to limit the recognition of publication (a) in manner,

or (b) in matter ? (a) Zoologists have generally refused to accept names

of species appearing in the daily press, accompanied by descriptions pos-

sibly sent by telegraph ; but where are we to draw the line between tlie

popular newspaper or magazine, and, say, the Philosophical Transactions

of the Royal Society ? It is a serious matter to restrict publication, yet

the modern increase of mushroom magazines suggests the desirability of

legislation in this direction. Again, are we to recognise new names pub-

lished in an unsigned footnote to a report on a public discussion on a

totally distinct subject ? Here, again, where is the line to be drawn ?
Is a name appearing in the explanation to a plate and not in the text to

be accepted ? (b) Can any restriction be placed on language 1 Russian

and  Czech are  recognised                                     what about Japanese ?  Is it advisable to
                                                            ;
----                                                                                     --

ignore certain authors who refuse to comply with the recognised usages
of zoologists, e.g., by brazenly misdating their publications or by persistent
ignoring of the work of others 1

(B) The following questions arise in connection with Bibliography :

     (1) What limits should be set to hiblioyraphy ? The aim is to bring to
the workers on any one subject information as to all works published on

that subject. Bibliography is limited (a) in degree, {h) in kind), (a) There

are limits to the minuteness of subdivision : is the minute system of

slips (such as a slip for every mention of each species), proposed by the Royal

Society, feasible or desirable ? [h) Bibliography being a ' description of

writings,' it does not include criticism or interpretation other than may

Howbe needed to explain obscurities.   far should criticism enter into

bibliography ?

     (2) What means can he adopted for producing co-operation between the

various bibliographers ? Two means have lately come into prominence :
(a) the International Bureau at Zurich ; (b) the Dewey Decimal System

of Classification. («) The International Bureau has suffered at the in-
ception of its work through the serious illness of Dr. H. H. Field, so that

the results can hardly be criticised as yet. (b) The Dewey Decimal Classifi-
cation has recently been explained for English readers by Mr. W. E. Hoyle

in ' Natural Science,' vol. ix. pp. 4.3-48, July, 1896. Both of these means
will necessarily be discussed by the International Congress on Scientific

Bibliography, and the Zurich Bureau would doubtless be absorbed in any

ultimate scheme. Any suggestions for the improvement of the Royal

Society schemes, so far as they refer to zoology and paleontology, will

be welcomed by the present Committee.

     (3) Is it advisable that authors and editors should co-operate with
bibliographers in the ways that have recently been suggested, viz. : (a) by

construction of  catalogue or  index  slips                  (6)  by  heading  articles  with
                                                          ;

their decimal number ? Examples of catalogue slips may be seen in recent

issues of the Proceedings of the Royal Society, and the Quarterly Journal

of Microscopical Science, while the decimal number has been employed in
the Revue Scientifique, Bidletin de VAssociation pmir VAvancement des

     It is proposed to sift opinions obtained on these points, and to report
on them on a future occasion.

     Your Committee has also ventured to utilise its existence in sending

out the following circular to the editors of all publications connected with

zoology :

  --Dear Sir, I am desired by the Committee of the British Association

on Zoological Bibliography and Publication to draw your attention to the

following statement :

     It is the general opinion of scientific workers, with which the Com-

mittee cordially agrees :

     (1) That each part of a serial publication should have the date of

actual publication, as near as may be, printed on the wrapper, and, when

possible, on the last sheet sent to press.
     (2) That authors' separate copies should be issued with the original

pagination and plate-numbers clearly indicated on each page and plate,
and with a reference to the oi'iginal place of publication.
                                          --

492 REPORT-- 1896.

     (3) That authors' separate copies should not be distributed privately
before the paper has been published in the regular manner.

     The Committee, however, observes that these customs are by no means
universal, and constant complaints are made that one or other of them is
not put into force. In case the Publication or Society with which you
are connected does not comply with these desiderata, the Committee ven-
tures to ask whether it would not be possible for it so to comply in future.
Should you, however, have any good reasons against the adoption of these
suggestions, the Committee would be much obliged if you would kindly

inform it of your reasons, in order that it may be guided in its future

action.

     The Committee further begs to ask for your co-operation in the follow-
ing matter. There are certain rules of conduct upon which the best
workers are agreed, but which it is impossible to enforce, and to which it
is difiBcult to convert the mass of writers. These are :

     (4) That it is desirable to express the subject of one's paper in its title,
while keeping the title as concise as possible.

     (5) That new species should be properly diagnosed and figured when

possible.

     (6) That new names should not be proposed in irrelevant footnotes or
anonymous paragraphs.

     (7) That references to previous publications should be made fully and

correctly, if possible, in accordance with one of the recognised sets of
rules for quotation, such as that recently adopted by the French Zoological

Society.

     The Committee ventures to point out that these and similar matters
are wholly within the control of editors [redaction) and publishing com-
mittees, and any assistance which you can lend in putting them into effect
will be valued, not merely by the Committee, but, we feel sure, by zoolo-

gists in general.

     The answers received to this circular will, it is hoped, enable your
Committee to make further suggestions upon certain practical points.

     Your Committee desires that the following unanimous resolution should
be conveyed to tlie Committee of Recommendations : ' Considering how
important to zoologists is the speedy completion of the Index Generum et
Specierum Animalium, now being compiled by Mr. Charles Davies Sher-
born under another Committee of this Association, the present Committee
begs to urge upon the Association the advisability of extending to this

Index substantial pecuniary support.'
      Finally, your Committee ventures to recommend its re- appointment,

with a grant of bl. towards the expenses of printing and posting circulars.

--work have been published on Orthoptera by Herr Brunner von

Wattenwyl (P.Z.S., 1895), on Slugs by Mr. W. E. Collinge (P. Malaco-

1896). The arrangement with the trustees of the Bernice P. Bishop

Museum in Honolulu, alluded to in the last report, has been

ratified, and the Committee is consequently not in need of funds at
present. Immediately after its last reappointment, the Committee lost
one of its members, Professor C. V. Riley, through his decease conse-
quent on a lamentable accident. It again applies for reappointment and
the sanction of the Association for having availed itself of the offer of the
trustees previously mentioned. This was asked for last year, and no
doubt it was intended that it should be granted ; but by some inad-
vertence the power actually given was only ' to avail themselves of such

assistance in their investigations as may be offered by the Hawaiian
Government.' No assistance of any importance has been rendered by the

Hawaiian Government.

--TJie Position of Geography in the Educational System of the Country.

     Interim Report of the Committee, consisting ofMr. H. J. Mackinder,
     (Chairman), Mr. A. J. Herbertson (Secretary), Mr. J. Scott
     Keltie, Dr. H. R. Mill, Mr. E. G. Ravenstein, and Mr. Eli
     SOWERBUTTS.

No account of the position of geography in our educational system can be

adequate which is not based on a comparison with Mr. Scott Keltie's well-

known and admirable report on Geographical Education prepared for the

Royal Geographical Society twelve years ago.' It is the best account we

possess of the position of geography at that time, not only in our own, but

also in other countries.

Since it was published several changes for the better have to be

chronicled, but unfortunately much of the criticism of the comparative

neglect of geography in the schools and colleges of the nation that should

foster it most remains only too true. Changes have occurred abroad as

well as at home, and the Committee deem it advisable to compare the

advances made in other lands with our own progress in recent years.

The best way to do this would be to make personal inspections similar

to those  made by  Mr. Keltie                                             but  as  the  Committee  have  no  funds at
                                                                       ;

their disposal, it has been necessary to carry on their work mainly by

correspondence. Information as to the position of geography has been

sought and obtained from educational authorities all over the country, and

from those of other lands, and the Committee desire to acknowledge their

indebtedness to many correspondents.

In the case of secondary schools, the Committee have had the benefit

of the inquiries carried on by the Geographical Association, whose object

is to improve the position of geography in such schools. The Committee

would draw attention to the memorial prepared by this Association, as a

result of their investigation. This memorial has been sent to the principal

examining bodies in the kingdom.

The Committee would also emphasize the need for immediate improve-

ment in the training of teachers in geogi'aphy, and the increase and exten-

sion of geographical work in the Universities, as recommended by the

International Geographical Congress last year.

The Committee consider it better to postpone the presentation of their

extended report to the Association until next year, as all the documents

necessary for a complete report have not yet come to hand. Accordingly

they ask that they may be reappointed.

Three sets of instruments (including barometers and anemometers)

accompany this report were made by the Secretary, and those for the

remaining stations by the Chairman of your Committee. The barometer

i-eadings, unless stated otherwise, have been reduced to 32° and corrected

for gravity, but no attempt has been made to reduce them to the sea-

been determined by spirit-levelling, and with the extension of railway

surveys this information is likely to be forthcoming at an early date.

     oj 'the Committee, consisting of Professor L. F. Vernon Harcourt,
    Professor Unwin, Mr. G. F. Deacon, and Mr. AV. H. Wheeler

     (Secretary). (Draivn up hij tlte Secretanj.)

After the appointment of the Committee at the Meeting at Ipswich
a copy of the paper on the Effect of Wind and Atmospheric Pressure, read

at tlie meeting at Ipswich, was sent to the authorities of all the principal
l)orts in the Kingdom ; and also through the Foreign Office to the Hydro-
graphic Departments of the principal maritime ports abroad. The paper

was accompanied by a letter asking on behalf of the Committee for
any information as to the records of tides affected by gales or in any way
bearing on the subject dealt with in the paper, and a form showing the

information required.

To these communications a large number of replies were received

expressing the willingness of the senders to co-operate in the inquiry as

far as possible. In the great majority of cases, however, the recoi'ds of

the tides at the ports and of the meteorological conditions were not kept

in such a manner as to l)e useful in affording the information required.

Five ports were selected as fairly representing the tidal conditions

round the English coast. The tidal records of these ports were freely

placed at the disposal of the Committee : those at Liverpool for the tides

by Mr. M. A. Sweney, R.jST., the Marine Surveyor, and for the barometer

and wind by Mr. W. E. Plummer, of the Bidston Observatory, with the

consent of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board ; those for Sheerness

and Portsmouth  by  Admiral Wharton,  Hydrographer of  the Admiralty
                                                                                                                    ;

and those at Hull by Mr. E. Lake, the Manager of the Hull Docks of the

North-Eastern Railway Company. Those for Boston are from the register

of tides kept hj Captain Hudson, the Harbour IMaster.

Mr. Deas, on 1)ehalf of the Clyde Navigation Trustees, furnished

diagrams and particulars of the principal gales which occurred on the

Clyde during the last few years.

The Government of India, through the Secretary of State for India,

offered to place at the disposal of the Committee the records of the tides
observed at the several ports, and also forwarded a copy of the Handbook
of Cyclonic Storms in the Bay of Bengal. The time available has rendered

it impossible as yet to make use of this information.
     The Norwegian Government forwarded for the use of the Committee

five volumes containing tables relating to tidal and meteorological

conditions on the coasts of Norway. These volumes contain a large

amount of valuable information, but there has not been time as yet to

make use of them.

     Copies of the Reports for 1894, 1895, 1896, prepared for the Canadian

Government, on the ' Tides and Currents in Canadian Waters,' have also

been sent by Mr. W. Bell Dawson, C.E., the Engineer in charge of the

Tidal Survey.

   A copy of ' De Ingenieur ' of September 26, 1891, published at the

Hague, containing an article by M. E. Engelenberg, C.E., on the ' Influence

of the Wind both in Direction and Pressure upon the Sea Level,' was sent

for the purpose of assisting in this investigation by M. Ortt, of the H-i ""

504 REPORT--1896.

This article has been translated into English. It contains valuable
information and statistics bearing on this subject.

     The analysis of the Tidal Records of the ports of Liverpool, Ports-
mouth, Sheerness, Boston, and Hull has occupied all the time available.

Had more opportunity been afforded it was intended to extend the inA'esti-

gation over a greater number of years.
     In considering the report it must be borne in mind that the object of

the investigation was only for the practical purpose of ascertaining
whether the records of the wind and atmospheric pressure as obtained by
an observer at any particular port afibrded a reliable guide to pilots and
mo.riners navigating vessels over bars and up the channels of tidal rivers,
and to those engaged in coast work, as to the variations to be expected in
the height of the tides from those ascertained by calculation and given in
the Admiralty or local tables.

     The deductions to be drawn from a careful examination of the
information embodied in the following tables are

      1. That the tides are influenced both by atmospheric pressure and by
 the wind to an extent which considerably affects their height.

      2. That the heiglit of about one-fourth of the tides is affected by wind.
      3. That the atmospheric pressure affecting the tides operates over so
 wide an area that the local indications given by the barometer at any
 particular port do not affoid any reliable guide as to the effect on the tide

 at that port.

       4. That although, so far as average results go, there can be traced a direct
 connection between the force and direction of the wind, and the variation

 in the height of the tides, yet that there is so much discrepancy in the
 average results when applied to individual tides that no reliable formula
 can be established for indicating the amount of variation in the height of

 the tide due to any given force of wind.
       r>. The results given in the tables relating to atmospheric pressure

  indicate that the effect of this is greater than has generally been allowed,
 a variation of half an inch from the average pressure causing a variation
  of 15 inches in the heiglit of the tides.

       It has sometimes been stated that an abnormally high tide is fol-
  lowed by a correspondingly low ebb. The investigations of the Dutch
  Engineers on the coast of Holland indicate that the efl'ect of gales on the
  tides is to raise both the low and high water level.

       The accompanying diagrams of the tides of December 1895 at
  Flushing, sent by M. Ortt, and of the corresponding tides on the Clyde,
  sent by Mr. James Deas, show that on this occasion the result of the gale
  was to raise the mean level of the sea at those places during the gale.

                             Atmospheric Pressure and the Tides.

       The variation in tlie pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of the
  sea must exercise a considerable effect on the tides. It is, however, very
  doubtful whether any reliable forecast of the effect can be deduced from
  the readings of the barometer at anyone station. AVater being practically
  incompressible, the variation of pressure on the Avhole surface of a basin
  filled with water, to which there is no outlet, cannot have any effect in

   raising or lowering the surface. If, however, the jsressure is high over
  one part of the basin and low on the other part, a variation in the height
   of the water in one part, as compared with the other, will take place.

An instance of this is afforded by the eifect of the great anticyclone

which occurred over the South of Europe in 1882, when the level of the
water of the Mediterranean at Antibes was lowered a foot, owing to the

exceptionally high pressure, the surface of sevei-al inland lakes being
lowered at the same time. It is stated l^y Mr. Bell Dawson, C.E., in his
' Report of the Survey of the Tides and Currents in Canadian Waters,

1894, that a difference of barometric pressure tends to produce a flow
from the higher towards the lower pressure, and that 'in the land-locked

area of the Gulf of St. Lawrence he found that the atmospheric pressure

influenced the flow of the water through the narrow inlets of that gulf,
and that in the Gulf of Mexico, with a high barometer over tlie area of
the gulf, and a lower pressure over the ocean outside, the speed of the
Gulf Stream is appreciably affected.'

     The effect of atmospheric pressure in raising and lowering the tides

was investigated by Sir J. W. Lubbock and communicated to the Royal

Society, the general conclusion he arrived at being that a rise of one inch
in the barometer caused a depression in the height of the tides in the

Thames of 7 inches, in the Mersey of 11 inches, and in the Avon of
\'2>\ inches. The paper on the subject does not, however, give any

adequate information as to the elimination of the effect of the wind from
the calculations on which these figures are based.

     Admiral Wharton, the Hydrographer of the Admiralty, in his address
to the Geographical Section at Oxford in 1894, stated that a difference of
one inch in the barometer has been shown to be followed by a difference
of one foot in the mean level of the sea, and that in those parts of the

world where the mean height of the barometer varies much with the

seasons, and the tidal range is small, this efl^ect is very marked.
     This subject was brought before the Meteorological Society in 188G, and

the Shipmasters' Society in 1894, in papers read by Captain Greenwood,
ox EFFECT OF AVIND AND ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE ON THE TIDES. 507

of Glasson Dock.  The results deduced were based on observations
                                                                                                                                                                                                           _

made over a lengthened period of the atmospheric gradients in the Irish
Sea from the south of iSt. George's Channel to Morecambe Bay. The

mean gradient over this distance-- over 240 miles-- he found to be

0-043 in., the mercury standing higher to that amount in the south.

He also .states that no storm of serious extent prevails over the United

Kingdom, unless there be a difference of pressure between any two

stations of the Meteorological Department exceeding h in., and that the

force of wind on the Beaufort scale does not exceed from live to .six,

unless the gradient is as high as 0-02 in fifteen miles. On the data

obtained. Captain Greenwood prepared a table for use on that part of the

coast, showing the effect of the difference of the gradient on the tides.

This table is given in the ' Kludometric ' Tide Table published by him

annually.

    From an analysis of the tides at five ports round the coast, given in

the following tables, it will be seen that, taking all tides raised or lowered

more than six inches from the calculated height, when the wind was

blowing with a force less than three of the Beaufort scale, coincident with

a variation in atmospheric pressure of 0-25 inch from the average,
the number of tides affected by the pressure, as recorded by the barometer

reading at local stations in a manner that would naturally be expected,

was nearly equal to those affected in a contrary direction, 56 per cent,
being depressed when the pressure was above the average, or raised when

it was below, and 44 per cent, being influenced in the opposite direction.
      These results indicate that the reading of the barometer at a single

port is not a reliable guide as to the effect of pressure in raising or

lowering the height of the tide, and that no reliable data as to the effect
of atmospheric pressure on the tides can be arrived at, except by simul-

taneous observations of the barometer, the wind, and the tides over

extended areas of both land and sea.

Tables, when the wind did not exceed a force of 3 on the Beaufort scale
(as reduced from the mean velocity), and the barometer was 0-25 inch above
or below the average.

    Low water of spring tides is taken as 9 feet below the Old Dock sill.

      Holden's Tide Tables appear to give the predicted tides too low, 78 per

cent, of the tides being above those given in the Tide Tables, a mean of

--1-04 foot, and only 22 percent, below a mean of 0-46 foot. This, to

a certain extent, atfects the results obtained in the above table.

22 per cent, below, an average of 0"46 foot. This to some extent affects

the results given.

     Of about 2,800 tides recorded in the two years, .393, or 192 in a year,
or about 14 per cent., can be traced as being affected by the wind. Of
these 192 tides, 140, or about 73 per cent., were increased by south-
easterly and south-westerly winds blowing more or less in the same
direction as the flood tide, and only two depressed by northerly winds,
leaving 50 tides, or about 26 per cent., as affected by wind blowing in an
opposite direction to that which might have been expected.

         Summary.

     Taking the mean I'esult of the five ports, the following results are

obtained :

     180 tides are affected by the wind in a year, or about 26 per cent, of

the whole.
      123 are either increased by winds blowing with the tide or depressed

by winds against the tide.
     67 are influenced in an opposite way.
     The mean force of the wind affecting these tides is 4-02 (Beaufort

scale).

    With the mean rise of the tide above low water of spring tides
18"14 feet, the mean variation in the height of the tides is 1389 inches.

    As showing the extent to which tides may be affected by wind during

gales, the following variations from the expected or natural height are
taken from the observations contained in the preceding tables :

Aberdeen, about 270 miles, varied from 0-12 inch to 0-49 inch, the
depression being in the north, the barometer there being 1 inch below

the average. On the 18th and 19th, the days of the gale, the barometer

rose rapidly until it became in the north 0-21 inch above the average,
and in the south 0'43 inch below, the gradient being reversed to 0'65
inch on the 18th and 0"53 inch on the 19th, with the depression in the
south. The general direction of the wind was north-west to north-east,
blowing after midday on the 18th with a force from 8 to 10. The effect
of these gales, blowing from opposite directions, affected all the ports

round the coast, but in a very varying degree. On the north-east coast
the effect was not great, but in the Wash and in the southern part of the

North Sea its effect was felt to such an extent that at Boston the difference
between two succeeding tides was 7 feet 8 inches ; at Yarmouth G feet
2 inches, which is more than the total rise of a spring tide ; at Dover
the variation was 5 feet 3 inches ; while at Portsmouth it was only 1 foot

9 inches, and at Avonmouth 3 feet 9 inches. At Liverpool, on the 17th,

the wind was blovring from S.E. to S.W. with force of 5 ; on the 18th it

backed to the N.W. with force of 6 to 7.

     In the following table two tides are given at twenty-four hours'
interval on the 17th and 18th.

In the gale of November 13th, 1894, the wind at the Scillj'- Islands

blew strongly from the north-west, backing on the following day to the

south-west with a force of 7. At Holyhead, on the 13th, the wind was

from the west in the morning with a force of 6, backing to south-west in

the evening, and blowing with force of 8, and continuing in that quarter

during the rest of the week. At Belfast and Cork the direction was S.W.,

force 8. On the north-east coast the direction was S.W., force moderate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

further down the coast on 13th the direction was W.N.W., force 5,

changing to S.W., force 9 ; in the English Channel, direction S.W., force
7 to 10. The barometer was about 0"25 below the mean, the gradient

between Scilly and Ardrossan being 0-84. The steepest gradient was

across England, being as between Scilly and Denmark 0-84, the readingbeing

29-84 at the former place, and 29-00 at the latter. Full moon was on

the 13th. With these conditions the tides were aflected as follows :
    At Holyhead the evening tide on the 13th was raised 4 feet above

the natural height. The wind continued to blow here stiffly from the

south-west all the week, and the tides were all above the natural height,

varying from 2 feet 5 inches to 4 feet above.

At Belfast the tide on the 13th was raised 4 feet 10 inches, and the

mean increase for five tides was 2 feet 9 inches above.
    At Cork on the 11th the tide was raised 2 feet 8 inches, and on the

13th 2 feet 5 inches.

At Liverpool the evening tide of the 13th was raised 3 feet above the

natural height, and the succeeding tides 1 foot 2 inches and 1 foot

10 inches.

At Glasson Dock the evening tide of the 1 3th was 2 feet, G inches

higher, and the succeeding tides 10 inches and 12 inches higher.

At Leith on the east coast the evening tide of the 14th was raised

2 feet 3 inches ; and at Sunderland 2 feet 9 inches.
    Lower down the coast the force of the S.W. gale was more felt,

blowing in the "Wash with force of 8.

    At Hull the tides of the 12th were depressed respectively 1 foot

6 inches and  1  foot                                 on the 13th  1  foot 2 inches and   foot 2 inches ; and
                                                   ;

on the 14th 1 foot 8 inches and 1 foot 5 inches.

At Boston the evening tide of the 1 3th was depressed 1 foot 2 inches,

and the morning tide of the 14th 3 feet 5 inches, the evening tide being

raised 1 foot, and the next morning tide 1 1 inches.

    At Dover, the force and direction of the wind being the same as in the

Wash, the morning tide was depressed 3 feet 3 inches, the evening tide

being raised 1 foot 6 inches.

At Sheerness the tide was depressed 1 foot 6 inches in the evening of

the 14th, and raised 3 feet 3 inches on the morning of the 15th. At the

Victoria and Albert Dock the tide was depressed 3 feet 5 inches in the

evening of the 14th, and raised 1 foot 8 inches on the following morning.

At the lower end of the Eng»lish Channel the effect of this south-west
gale was to raise the tides
                                                      2  feet         at  Portsmouth  on  the  eveninag  of  the

l3th, and the two succeeding tides 1 foot 10 inches and 1 foot 6 inches.

At Devonport the morning tide of the 14th was raised 2 feet 9 inches,

and the two following tides 1 foot 9 inches and 2 feet 2 inches.

In the Bristol Channel the tides were raised 1 foot 4 inches at Cardiff,

and 1 foot 5 inches at Avonmouth.

    The mean result of the eflFect at fourteen ports round the coast was

--;is follows : The mean rise of the spring tides at these places is

L'0-43 feet, the mean force of the wind was 6-78, and the mean variation
of the tides from the natural height 2-70 feet. On the west coast the

tides were raised by the gale 3| feet, and on the east coast depressed to

mean barometer 29-19. The p.m. tide of the 15th was 4 feet 6 inches

above the normal height, being the highest tide of which there is any

record. The two following tides were raised 1 foot 5 inches and 1 foot

11 inches.

     At Glasgow tlie wind from the 11th to the 16th was principally from

the S.W., blowing with force of 8 on the 11th to 6 on the 16th, the

barometer avei-aging 1-26 below the mean, and the lowest readin"- bein"

28-31 on 11th. On the 11th high water occurred three hours before the

proper   time,   and   rose 6 feet above the natural height                                                                                                                                      on the following
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

day the tide was raised 2 feet 1 inch. On the 16th the tide reached high

water 2| hours before the proper time, it then ebbed 2 feet 6 inches and

flowed again 3 feet, the height reached being 5 feet above the natural

height.

                              Gale, December 1895.

    From the 1st to the 7th the wind was blowing from the S.W. with a
mean force of 5, increasing to a gale on the 5th and 6 th, the force on the

west coast being from 8 to 9 and on the east from 5 to 6. The mean
barometer on the east coast was 29-87 at the North Foreland, and

29-44 at Leith, showing a gradient of 0-43 ; and on the west coast 30-04

at the Scilly Islands, and 29-10 at Ardrossan, a gradient of 0-94, the
mean resultant being a S.W. gradient of 0-60.

    At Leith on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th the wind was from the S.W., the
average force was 4-83, the maximum on the 5th being 6. The averacre

increase in the height of the tide was 1 foot 3 inches, the maximum

increase being 2 feet 6 inches on the 5th. On the 6th and 7th the wind
was from the N.W., mean force 3-75, mean increase of tide 2 feet, greatest

force of wind 5, and greatest increase of tide 2 feet 5 inches.

     It will thus be seen that at this station the tides were increased both

by S.W. and N.W. winds.

     At Grimsby, near the mouth of the Humber, the wind from the 1st

to the 5th was from the S.W., blowing with a mean force of 5, increasin<r

to a gale with a force of 8 on the 5th. From the 6th to the 8th the

direction was from the N.W., with force of 6 to 7 ; and from the 8th

to the 10th S.W., with force of from 3 to 6. The mean force for the

whole period was 5. On the 1st the tides were raised at Grimsby

1  foot  3 inches and 8 inches                                                                                               on the 2nd, 1      foot 9       inches and                                                 3 inches                                  on

                                        I. The Past.

A UNIFORM system of screw threads was first proposed by the late Sir

Joseph AVhitworth in 1842, and his thread, a compromise of the numerous
threads then in use, has become of almost universal use for all large

-- --screws that is, screws of over \ in. diameter in the United Kingdom.

     Mr. William Sellers in 1864 introduced another thread in the United
States of America, which has come into very general use in that country,
and this thread has recently been accepted by the French.

     In 1881 the British Association formed a committee to determine a
gauge for the manufacture of the various small screws used in electrical
apparatus, clock work, and for other analogous purposes ; and after three
years of unremitting labour this committee, in 1884, recommended a screw
gauge which has come into very general use in this country, ft was
based on the metrical system, and with one slight modification on the
system adopted in 1880 by the Swiss watchmakers.

   --The series of screws recommended is given in the following taljle :

                                     II. The Present.

     The Committee were formed ' to consider means by which better prac-
tical effect can be given to the introduction of the Screw Gauge proposed

by the Association in 1884.' They have held many meetings. They have
added Colonel Watkin, C.B., RA., Mr. E. Rigg, and JMr. W. A. Price to
their number. They have received great assistance from the Pratt and
AVhitney Company of Hartford (Connecticut, United States of America),
who supplied each member of the Committee with a copy of their book on

' Standards of Length and their Practical Application.' They were unfor-
tunately deprived of the services of Mr. Hewitt, who was seized with a very
severe illness after the first meeting, but they recei\ed from him his paper

' On the Manufacture of Standard Screws for Machine-made Watches,' read

before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in October 1894 ; a paper
which has been of great service. Mr. Griffith, representing the Council,
attended regularly, and took advantage of his presence in the United

States of America to visit the Pratt and Whitney works.
     Evidence was taken by the Committee from large users of the screws.

Mr. Willmot, of the Post Office Factory, stated that the Post Office had
used some tens of millions of screws made to the British Association gauge,
and he had never received a single complaint.

     Various apparatus for measuring screws and different methods of testing
their accuracy were carefully considered and discussed.

     The Committee came to the conclusion that it was necessary to con-
sider the subject from the three points of view of the Standards Office,
the Works Manager, and the Workman.

                           1. The Standards Office.

This must include, not only the custody of recognised and authen-

ticated standards, but also a scientific mode of measuring the dimensions

of commercial gauges and screws themselves, and of comparing their

accuracy with the authorised standards. The peculiarity of the British

Association gauge is this, that material standards are not impera-

tively necessary. Thetable of dimensions given at page 527, together with

the formula, enables any draughtsman to reproduce the form and pitch to

any desired scale on paper. Colonel Watkin has shown to the Committee

how to throw side by side, for purposes of very accurate comparison, a

photographic image of

(a) The screw to be examined.

(b) The standard with which it is to be compared.

A(c) scale which may be divided to yTranoth of an inch, the images of

these three objects being so close to one another that a comparison to

a very high degree of accuracy can be made. The Appendix to this Re-

port contains a description of Colonel Watkin's method.

     Mr. Price submitted to the Committee a microscopical method of
measuring screws. The screw to be measured is attached to the stage of

the microscope, the traversing slide of which is provided with a vernier

and scale, while a vertical cross-hair in the eye-piece forms the index of

the instrument. AVhen the microscope has been adjusted for clear focus

the screw is traversed across the field until the cross-hair intersects tlie

thread of the screw at the desired point. The traversing screw of the

.slide is then turned until the corresponding point of the next thread is

intersected by the cross-hair, and the reading of the vernier on the scale

gives the measurement of the pitch with great accuracy. Mr. Buckney

showed also how the angle of the thread could be accurately verified by
this method by having suitable hairs.

                                       2, The Works Manager.

     The Committee, after considering various methods, came to the con-
clusion that male gauges for ordinary workshop use were best tested, as
regards pitch and form of thread, by a template or ' comb ' for each number,
the accuracy of which has been verified by the photographic method.
The screw to be tested is placed against the teeth of the comb, and the
correctness of its fit verified by the eye against a light background.

      The external dimensions of the screw can be obtained by any good
micrometer gauge, and the internal diameter or core by a gauge such as
that which is described in the Appendix by Mr. Stroh.

      The Committee have failed to discover any very reliable method of

testing, to any degree of accuracy, a female standard gauge. No clearance

was allowed in the original definition of the system between the male
and female standards. Hence a mathematically accurate male gauge
cannot be screwed into a mathematically accurate female gauge. But

-- --by allowing a certain mai'gin a maximum and minimum diameter an

internal compatibility of dimensions is allowed in the workshop gauges,
which is of a sound, practical character. The female screw must always
be a little larger than the standard male gauge, but this must never exceed

what is known as a ' good fit.'

   A working margin is given in Appendix III. by a table prepared by

Mr. Le Neve Foster.
     Mr. Price, on belialf of the Committee, has made a series of measure-

ments of certain sizes of B.A. screws which show the limits within which
they are obtained in practice. His measurements indicate that the
variation from the full diameter, which must be allowed for necessary
inequalities in manufacture, is not a function of the diameter, but is rather
in the nature of a constant quantity. This quantity appears to be
approximately 1 mil. below the full diameter for all brass screws of sizes
Nos. to llj and !·;> mil. for all iron and steel screws of the same sizes.

                                         3. Tlie Workman.

     The measuring gauge, available to the workman as well as to the fore-

man, is one that need not possess the mathematical accuracy of the
standard gauges, but nevertheless it must not be allowed to deteriorate
or to maintain false belief in its accuracy. Those that are subject to
pressure and friction must necessarily wear, become distorted, and, in
time, inaccurate. Hence the Committee were anxious to obtain a mode
of comparison which would be free from this source of error. The most
important measurement, whose accuracy should be easily verified by the

workman is that of the pitch, and this is easily effected with the ' half-
nut gauge ' described in Appendix II.

     The Committee are i^leased to find that the result of their inquiry and
discussion enables them to recommend for general use means of comparison
which do not involve the wear and deterioration of the gauges. Defor-
mation is confined to the taps and screw-plates, and as frequent verifica-
tion of the manufactured screw is desirable continued accuracy is insured.
With the introduction of simple methods of comparison and measurement
errors in the screws issued and want of interchangeability are rendered
improbable in a well-regulated shop, and unnecessary in any place.

    There remains now to determine a place where material standard

gauges are available for immediate comparison, and where the photographic
and microscopic methods can be readily applied to verify gauges and to
obtain a record of those submitted for examination. This means work

to be done, expenses to be incurred, and fees to be paid, as is now done at

the Kew Observatory for chronometers, thermometers, «fcc.

      Ill, The Future,

     The opinions fonned by the Committee, after full and exhaustive dis-
cussions, for furthering the objects to be attained may be summarised as

follows :

     (a) The Committee recommend the construction and housing of the comb
form of gauges or templates of the B. A. screw thread, by comparison with
which master gauges or templates may be exactly and conveniently verified.

     (b) That, as no exact system of testing female threads has yet been
devised, the Committee restrict themselves to recommending means for
keeping male threads to gauge, and this they consider will be sufficient

for the purpose of securing practical uniformity in female screws.

     (c) Male threads can best be measured by the comb, combined with

suitably arranged tests to give the correct diameters.
      (d) That for purposes of verification or standardisation the gauges to

be deposited for reference should consist of a complete set of these comb-

pieces, and a complete corresponding set of male screws, so that new
combs can be compared Avith those deposited, or male screws can be com-
pared with the standard combs with great accuracy by the photographic
or the microscopic method, and that these two methods may be conve-

niently used to check and corroborate each other.
      (e) That in order to obtain interchangeability of these male screws for

practical workshop use it is sufl&cient that they should satisfy the following

tests :

     (1) There should be no appreciable difference in the fit of the screw
with a standard comb having not less than twelve teeth.

     (2) The diameter of the core must not exceed that laid down by the

B.A. specification.
     (3) The diameter of the screw measured over the thread must not ex-

ceed that laid down by the B.A. specification.
     (4) The diameter of the screw measured over the thread must not fall

short of that laid down by the B.A. specification by more than a certain
amount, which amount depends on the class of work and purpose to which

the screw is to be applied.

     The amount referred to in (4) must be settled by the persons in con-

trol of the work for which the screws are to be used.
     (/) They recommend for general use in the workshop the half-nut

gauge, as described in Appendix II., combined with inside and outside

diameter gauges.

     The Committee, in printing the tables, Appendix III., for which they

have to thank Mr. Le Neve Foster and Mr. Price, do not take the respon-
sibility of recommending any limits, but publish the information as an
indication of the limits of accuracy within which these screws may be

expected to be produced in practice.
     If the recommendations of the Committee be approved of, they further

recommend that the Committee should be reappointed for the purpose of
obtaining and verifying standard combs and male screws, and determining

the future home of the gauges.  mm2

Enlarged Shadoiv Photographs o/Scrcus. By Col. Watkin, C.B., S.A., d;c.

     The objects aimed at in producing enlarged photographs of screws

are

{a) To provide a means of verifying the accuracy of the shape of a

thread.

{b) To provide a means of accurately gauging the dimensions of screw-

threads.  .

    (c) To provide a record or certificate of a screw, in a similar manner

to the certificate of accuracy given by Kew Observatory.

    As in this process a standard scale is photographed at the same time

as the screw, a direct reading to any desired accuracy can be obtained.
There seems to be hardly any limit to the amount of enlargement, as
the difficulties inherent to the enlargement of an ordinary negative do not
apply to this process.

     The question arises, Does the shadow photograph give accuracy as

regards

1 Dimensions
                                                      ;

2. Shape of thread ?

     To test (1) a Xo. 2 B.A. thread was enlarged 37'IS times. The linear

dimensions could in this photo be measured to at least 3-jtVo^1i o^ ^'^ inch..
     The diameter, pitch, and angle of thread of this particular screw were

gauged by a member of the Committee, and found to be

             By an Elliott gauge .                           . O-ISIS 1 ,.          ^

Fig. 1 shows a reduced copy of an actual photograph and scale.

    As regards (2) there has been considerable discussion as to whether

the shadow photograph gave the true shape of the tliread. There are

          ! iG. 2.                                           two methods of obtaining a

                                                             one in which the axis of the

                                                             screw is at right angles to the

                                                             beam of light ; the other in
A which the axis of the screw

                                                             is inclined at an angle which

                                                             differs from the right angle

                                                             by the angle of the pitch of

                                                             the screw.

                                                             As regards the first method,

                                                             a mathematical consideration

worked out by Mr. Price seems to show that a slight correction of about

·^ degree in the total angle of the screw thread would have to be made.

I think, as regards the second method, no correction is required. In any

case the correction is so small that for practical purposes it might be
neglected, as on a No. 2 B. A. thread it only represents about ^o'jntth of
an inch, and proportionately less on the smaller sizes.

     However, to determine practically whether this was the case, I
suggested filing away a part of the screw to be photographed to make it a
comb. There could be no doubt that the photo of such a comb would
give the true shape of the thread. Mr. Stroh kindly supplied such a
screw. From the photos it would appear that there is no practical differ-
ence in the shape, and that therefore the photograph of a complete screw

gives a true record of the shape as well as the dimensions.

     The following gives the detail of the method employed in photographing

the screws :

On a plate A, b, c, d, fig. 2, is a block, E, to which is secured a glass

Ascale, F, which has been carefully etched with lines ^^^ inch apart.  piece

of spring brass, hg, serves to hold the screw kk to be photographed, with

its axis parallel to the plate A, b, c, d. The distance of the screw from

the plate can be adjusted by means of the screw i, so that when the scale

    Fig. 3.

is sharply focussed on the screen the shadow of the screw may also be

brought into focus.
     The frame A, B, c. D, fig. 2, is adjusted in the same position as an

ordinary microscopic slide in a magic lantern arranged for microscopic
work ; only I found it desirable to employ a photographic lens of modern
design instead of the usual objective.

     The arrangement is shown in the accompanying diagram, fig. 3, where

     A represents the limelight ; b the ordinary condenser ; c Alum trough

           to stop the heat rays ; d Small condensing lens ; E Screw, in its
           frame as described in fig, 2 ; f Photographic lens ; G Milled head
            screw for focussing the lens f.

      In the gauge represented in fig. 4 the hole a is for the external
diameter. It should be of exactly the diameter given in the table of
                           ON THE SCREW GAUGE.                                                                 53:

Asizes for B.A. screws.         screw should pass into this liole freely, but

without much shake. The hole b is the minimum gauge, and the screw

should not pass into this hole. The difference of diameter between the

holes  a and  b  has  not  yet  been  determined  by the  Committee                                        in  the

a screw should just turn freely. The hole d is for the diameter of the

core, but as it is impossible, without turning down some of the threads

of a screw, to pass the core of it into this hole, the gauge e is provided

for gauging the core, or, in other words, the depth of the thread. It

consists of a fork the inner edges of which are shaped so as to enter

between the threads of a screw. The correctness of the pitch of a screw

is ascertained by placing it in the comb/ and against the back-rest g, and

by holding the gauge against the light or a white paper.
     It has been found by practice that there is considerable difficulty in

making these combs with any degree of accuracy, and also that it would
be almost impossible to carry out the above form of gauge for the smaller
sizes. It is therefore suggested that the gauge represented in fig. 5 has
certain advantages over the comb-gauge. With this the half-nut h is
employed for verifying the pitch of screws instead of the comb. The
half-nut can be carried out with greater certainty and ease, and is there-
fore less costly, and there is no difficulty in making it for the smaller
sizes, as shown in fig. 6. Gauges on the principle of figs. 5 and 6 have
also the advantage of being more compact and stronger for workshop

use.

   --The process of making the half-nut gauges is the following : T%\ o

have to be made at one time. When the two steel bars intended for

the gauges are filed to shape they are placed together, as shown in sketch
--oob REPORT 1896.

(a and I) ; a temjDoraiy rivet or bolt is put through the hole c, and the

ends intended to receive the half-nut device are clamped together as

Ashown.      hole of the diameter of the core is then drilled across the two

                                         Fig

bars at d, so that each bar receives one half of it. Tlie clamp is then
unscrewed, the bars are slightly separated, the tap is inserted between

them, and the clamp screw tightened again gently. Of course now the

two steel bars cannot meet, being prevented by the insertion of the tap.
But the smooth end of the tap is now fixed in a chuck on a lathe, and is
rotated forwai-ds and backwards, while the clamp screw is tightened from
time to time. This is carried on till the threads forming the half- nuts

are complete. It is only necessary towards the end of the operation to

separate the bars once or twice for the purpose of removing the bur
which is raised by the operation.

     Of the measurements given in the following table all, excepting the
No. 8 steel and No. 11 brass screws, were made with a gauge of which
the zero was out of adjustment, the measures to be reduced by -0002 in

the first 9 columns.

     These measurements were made to ascertain within what limits a
screw maker can work, not as chausson screws with their theoretical

diameters.

     It seems that 1 -2 inch below the full diameter is all that is required
for brass screws JSTos. to 11, and that the same is required for nil sizes.

     It is clear that steel screws are more troublesome than brass, but the
lot of No. 4 steel examined were probably not made with sufficient care.

    of the Committee, consisting of Professor A. B. W. Kennedy, F.B.S.

     {Chairman), Professor J. A. Ewing, F.R.S., Professor D. S.

    Capper, Professor T. H. Beare, and Professor W. C. Unwin,

     F.B.S. (Secretart/). (Ih-axvn up by the Secretary.)

It was stated in the previous report, presented at Ipswich in 1895, that
the Committee had decided initially to investigate the accuracy of instru-
ments for measuring the tension coefficient of elasticity, or Young's
modulus.

     It was decided that sets of standard test bars should be prepared to
be subjected to tension and the extensions measured by the instruments
in use in different engineering laboratories. The forms of the test bars

are shown in ligs. 1 and 2. Two of the standard test bars of each set

were cylindrical bars with screwed ends suitable for use with shackles
having spherical seatings. The third bar of each set was a flat bar
suitable for wedge grips. All the cylindrical bars were cut from a single
bar of specially strong steel rolled for the Committee by the Blenavon
Company. The flat bars were cut from a single plate of good mild steel.
Four sets were prepared, of which two were used for most of the measure-
ments. The bars were marked as follows :

     Flat bars. A, B, C, D, of mild steel, approximately 2 inches by h inch

in section.

     Cylindrical bars, E, F, G, H, of special steel, approximately 1 J inch in

diameter.

     Cylindrical bars, K, L, M, N, of special steel, approximately | inch in

diameter.

    The bars were carefully prepared by Mr. R. W. Munro. The

cylindrical bars had marked gauge points suitable for extensometers
8 inches, 10 inches, 16 inches, or 20 inches in length. The flat bars had
gauge points for extensometers 8 inches or 10 inches in length.

     In order to obtain some preliminary information as to the mechanical
properties of the standard bars, one round bar and one flat bar were
tested in the testing machine at the Central Technical College. The
following table gives the results obtained

Test sheet forms were drawn up by the Committee, to Le issued to

different observers with the sets of test bars, on which the observations

Awere to be recorded in a uniform manner.  sample of the form of ob-

servation sheet prepared by the Committee is printed on the opposite page.

In January 1895 two sets of test bars were sent out, to be circulated

amongst those observers who had consented to make measurements for
Athe Committee.

of stress to which the bar is subjected, then a different value of the mean

extension will be found for different values of the increment of load for

which the extension is observed.

Professor Kennedy suggested that the simple arithmetical mean of the

·observed extensions should be compared with the mean extension taken

«ut in the following way.

Suppose six micrometer readings are taken for six equal increments of

load. The extension is calculated for the first and fourth, the second and

fifth, and the  third  and         sixth- loading                                                     the  mean of  these is then taken.

 being sheltered by Ireland from the tumultuous and overwhelming seas
 of the Atlantic, ami further guarded by the Hanking coasts of Wales,
 Cumberland, South Scotland, and the ofl'-lying Isle of Man, its position

--as an examination of the map of the British Isles clearly shows is

assimilated more to a port situated within a large lake, like those of the
North American Continent, than one on an open and exposed seaboard

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

·while the numerous sheltered roadsteads, deep estuaries, and good har-
bours abounding along these coasts afford such facilities for economic
interchange of traffic as nowhere else exist throughout the coasts of Great

Britaiii.

     To these peaceful advantages is to be added the invaluable feature of
its unique position as regards safety in time of war, for, though modern
battleships, by reason of their great speed and comparative invulnera-
bility, are able to swoop down and make unlooked-for raids on an enemy's
coast, it may be considered that, while England maintains her supremacy
of the sea, a prudent hostile commander would scarcely risk annihilation
by attacking a seaport such as Liverpool, approachable only through the
well-guarded narrows of St. George's Channel, or the still narrower and
more easily watched North Channel by the Mull of Cantire, and further
protected by the mass of banks outside the port, the channels through
which could be easily defended. Landward, Liverpool has a supreme
advantage over the rest of England by being in close proximity to the

chief centres of manufacturing industry, as well as to great coal-fields
and salt-mines, which are most important adjuncts to its trade.

     Furtiier swelling the list of favourable elements are the unusual and
peculiar characteristics of the river Mersey itself ; namely, a deep,
capacious, and sheltered roadstead close to its mouth, with shores suitable
for the construction of docks and approached by easy sea channels, and so
large a tidal range and other such physical conditions as to enable it to

--maintain its natural advantages without the aid of art except as regards

its bar, eleven miles seaward of its mouth, where nature is now

being assisted by special dredging operations to improve its deep-water

condition.

     These salient advantages, now so briefly outlined, will readily account

for the Mersey having been wisely selected as the best and most secure
position for a great northern trading and distributing centre, to which

the merchandise of the world now easily gravitates.
     The foresight evidenced in such a selection has been more than amply

justified, for, from a small beginning, less than 200 years ago, when the

era of the manufacturing trade of the northern counties was com-
mencing, Liverpool has expanded ^jari passu with that trade, from its
position of an insignificant fishing village of a few hundred inhabitants
to that of the second, if not the pi'emier, commercial port of the world,

and now has, with its surrounding urban districts, a population of

upwards of 800,000.
     This splendid and unrivalled progress, though in some degree owing

to the foresight of its early founders and later administrators, is due
primarily to the natural advantages before mentioned, and chiefly to the
magnificent stretch of upwards of six miles of deep water which the
Mersey presents and maintains immediately in front of the city and its
suburbs, thus allowing docks of convenient form and size to be constructed
along its foreshore, easy of approach, thoroughly sheltered, and in all
respects suitable for sliips of every class, both large and small.

550 KEPORT-- 180G.

     In olden times, and while Liverpool ^v-as still in its infancy, the sea
trade of this part of Eiigland was carried on through the ports of Preston
and Chester, and that of the south-west of the country by Bristol and
Milford Haven.

     Preston was a prominent port of the Romans, but lost its value, even
in the early days of light-draught vessels, by the deterioration and silting
up of the river Ribble and the exposed condition of its estuary ; while
Chester, which chiefly commanded the trade and intercourse with Ireland,
though also a favoured port with the Saxons and Romans, became obsolete
from a like cause. It may, however, be remarked that the authorities of
both the Ribble and the Dee have, in recent days, sought the aid of
artificial works to improve the navigable condition of these rivers.

     The precise origin of the name ' Liverpool ' has for long been some-
what a difficulty to all inquirers, and, though a great variety of opinions

have from time to time been under discussion, no definite conclusion has
been come to, the meaning of the first portion of the name, ' Liver,' being
the knotty point of contention.

     "Without having gone sufficiently into the question to justify more than
a general opinion on the much-mooted point, it appears to the author
sufficiently reasonable to suppose that, as the ancient seal on the old deeds
of the Corporation, also on the present city arms, is emblazoned with a
traditional bird called the ' liver,' generally accepted as the cormorant

(though, as some suggest, it may have been originally intended for the

more noble symbolic eagle of St. John, the patron saint of the guilds of
that day), it is very probable that the first portion of the name is derived
from that source, and that the creek or pool, evidenced by ancient maps
as existing towards the centre of the old town, was the habitation of the

cormorant, thus providing a fitting terminal for tlie ornithological puzzle.

     As in tlie case of the doubtful origin of the name ' Liverpool,' and

the variety of opinions that have been urged on the point, a difficulty

exists, though probably not so prominently, as to the origin of the name
' Mersey,' though it is generally accepted that the river was so called from
having been the northern boundary line of the kingdom of Mercia, and

this appears to be a reasonable explanation.
      It is stated by Picton, in his history of the district, that the earliest

documentary evidence having reference to Liverpool is of the date 1004,
when it is said to be mentioned in a deed of the reign of King Ethelred.

     He also relates that King John, about the year 1170, founded the

borough and port of Liverpool, and constructed a castle for their defence
this was chiefly with a view to facilitate the communication with Ireland,
which was in a chronic state of disaffection and disturbance, rather than
as a commercial enterprise, which in those days was little thought of.

     The ri\ er Mersey first takes that name in Cheshire at a point four
miles to the east of the town of Stockport, at the junction of the two small
 rivers Goyt and Etherow, which severally rise in the high lands bordering
 South Yorkshire, North Derbyshire, and Cheshire. They are insignificant
 streams, scarce worthy of the name of rivers, their courses being narrow,
tortuous, and irregular.

      The length of the river Mersey proper, from the point of junction
 above mentioned to its mouth between the north end of Liverpool on

the Lancashire shore and Xew Brighton on the Cheshire shore, is 56

 miles. It has, as tributaries, the Tame, running into it near Stockport,
 and the Irwell, one of its most important afiluents, which has its source ia

North Lancashire, and which, after receiving the waters of minor streams,
passes through the city of Manchester, and joins the Mersey at Flixton,
eight miles lower down. Between that point and Warrington the Mersey
receives from the adjoining marshes the waters of several small streams.
The aggregate drainage area of the combined catchment basins above

Warrington is about 750 square miles. From Warrington downward to
Runcorn, a distance of about ten miles, it partakes of the form of an
ordinary narrow tidal river, passing through the low-lying marsh lands of

the district with little fall.

    At the town of Runcorn, where the name Runcorn Gap fitly describes

the narrow and si^ecial configuration of its high and abrupt red sandstone
shores, the Mersey is crossed by the high-level viaduct which carries the

London and North-western Railway to Liverpool. From this point the

river passes into the enlarged portion of the estuary, which at high tide
assumes the appearance of a large inland lake. Reaching seaward to the
south end of Liverpool, a distance of about 12^ miles, by from 2 to 3
miles wide, with an area of 30 square miles, it is filled to about half-tide
level with a deposit of sand, which mostly becomes dry at low tide. This
part of the river, owing to its form and size, plays an important part in
maintaining the deep water abreast of Liverpool, as well as the sea

·channels.

     About 2^ miles below Runcorn the river Weaver passes into the

Mersey on its left bank, and, with its tributaries, forms its most important
adjunct, being the chief drainage basin of mid-Cheshire, with a water-
shed of 550 square miles.

     Below the mouth of the Weaver the adjoining part of Cheshire
is drained by the Gowy and a few other insignificant streams, while

·on the Lancashire side minor streams of a like character drain that

district.

     The drainage of the city of Liverpool is effected by an ordinary system
of sewers which pass into large intercepting culverts, carried at intervals
through the Dock Estate into the river. Owing to the large volume of
tidal water which daily passes backwards and forwards, the material from
this source is swept away, leaving little or no trace of fouling along the

foreshores.

     The aggregate drainage area of these several rivers and streams
is computed at 1,724 square miles. The total amount of up-river water
discharging into the estuary in each twelve hours is estimated at from
two to thi'ee million cubic yards, while the volume of tidal water on high
springs is computed at about 710 million cubic yards, and on low neaps at
281 million cubic yards. It should not be inferred from this disparity in
quantity between the volume of upland water and that of the tides that
the former does not play an important part in the regime of the river
on the contrary, the river channel is formed primarily by the land water,
and the wandering tendency which it displays in its downward course to

the sea is the first step towards insuring the capacity of the estuary
being fully maintained. This is efiected by its action in grooving out the
surface of the sandbanks, so forming minor channels to receive the
in-flowing tide, which, running through them with great velocity, enlarges
and extends them. This process, repeated in all the varying positions
which the channels take, ploughs up the whole area of the estuary from

shore to shore, so preventing the growth of the banks by accretion and
the tidal displacement which would follow such accretion.
--552 REPORT 1896.

     Near the point where the Mersey leaves the wide portion and enters
the comparatively narrow channel abreast of Liverpool, it assumes the

condition of a magnificent deep-water river passing shore lines largely in

rock, and midway of its course of about six miles to the sea it gradually
narrows to a width of 1,000 yards, widening again towards its mouth to
about 1,800 yards. There is ample width in this deep reach of the river
for the convenient handling and anchoring of a large number of the
largest ships, the soundings at low water for the most part ranging from

40 to 50 feet, with considerable areas below 60 feet. It is here welt
sheltered by the high lands on the Cheshire shore from all winds from

south to west, and by the Lancashire shore from south to north. Tha
Bay, as has been said, is open to north and north-west gales, and these
cause heavy seas on the banks, which, however, having their crests for
the most part much above low-water level, act to a very considerabls
extent as breakwaters, and modify greatly the force of the waves through
the sea channels as well as at the mouth of the river and along the lino
of docks. From the point where the river Mersey enters the sea at

New Brighton on the Cheshire shore, that shore trends westerly in a

straight line to the mouth of the Dee, a distance of about eight miles,
and the Lancashire shore in a straight line northerly for a like distance.
Within these coast-lines are contained about 23,000 acres of sand*
banks, which dry at low tides, and form the formidable barrier fronting

the port.

     Doubtless a large proportion of this enormous mass of sand is brought
from the adjoining coasts of Wales, by the action of the sea and currents)
and deposited within this rectangular area, which it cannot pass, to

"xvhich is added the large quantity that is necessarily brought down by

the river from the continual wasting of its banks and foreshores, as also
from the quantity of detritus that is constantly being conveyed seawards-
by floods and freshets.

     Over and through these banks the flood and ebb tides force thei?
way, maintaining, however, one large well-defined deep channel, used by
all the important ships of the port, with two subsidiary channels of

less value.

     The main channel is known as the Crosby, and for the first six miles-

of its course it takes a straight and northerly direction, running parallel
Avith the Lancashire coast, and at low tide skirting its extended sandy
foreshore in front of the suburbs of Seaforth, Waterloo, and Formby,.
while the main body of the great Burbo Bank forms its seaward barrier
and boundary. The continuity of the inner face of the Burbo is-
frequently broken by creeks, depressions, and shallow channels, evidencing
the eflbrts of the ebb currents to find their way to the open sea through a

shorter course than that of the main channel. At the end of the six-mile-

reach, which is marked by the Crosby Lightship, the Channel trends,
with a gradual curve seaward, in a north-westei-ly direction to the Bap,
which is about five miles from the Crosby Light, and thence forces and
maintains its way through the enormous mass of sand, which forms the
great Burbo and Taylor's Banks, and which, but for this severance, would
present a solid unbroken mass, with a sea face in the form of an ordinary
beach. The outer portion of the main channel is known as the Queen's

Channel.

     The Crosby Channel, considering its leeshore position, and its being
flanked and almost surrounded by vast masses of mobile sand, lias maici-

tained its general conditions, both as regards position and capacity, with

singular regularity, so that the conditions of navigation have remained

practically uniform.

     This indicates the value of the tidal volume flowing into and out of
the Upper Estuary, and clearly points out the vital necessity of main-

taining it undiminished and untrammelled to the fullest possible extent.
     The Bar, as is doubtless well understood, is a sandy accumulation or

ridge, with a long sloping foreshore on each side, stretching across the

mouth  of  the  main  channel                                                                                                on  plan  its  form  is  that of  an irregular

curve, somewhat in the shape of a horseshoe with its convex side seaward,

separating the deep water of the channel from that of the ofting. It is
the result of the loss of concentration of the current due to the channel

departing from its regularity of form where it issues from the banks
and meets their outer or sea slopes. It is joined up on its north flank t®

the tail or westernmost extremity of the most seawardly bank of the
group known as the Zebra Flats, which forms an extension of Taylor's
Bank under water, and on the south to the western spit of the

Little Burbo.

The Bar is not constant in {position, but has been found to be moving

slowly seaward, in accord with the growth of the banks in a like direction,

maintaining, however, its general characteristics. [Further on, the

author refers to the works undertaken to give increased depth of

water on the Bar.]

  --In addition to this main channel, there are two minor or subsidiary

channels, viz. the Formby Channel and the Rock Channel. The-

former is a prolongation nearly in the same direction as that of the inner

reach of the main channel, which it leaves at a point abreast of th«

Crosby Lightship and continues in a northerly direction to the Formby

Spit, after which it reaches the open sea, five miles from its junction witk

the Crosby Channel. It is narrow, shallow, and somewhat tortuous when

it leaves the main channel, but is thoroughly buoyed, and is used by

small vessels proceeding to and from the north, as it saves a detour dc

several miles.

     The Rock Channel, so called from the rocks which crop up at the

point at New Brighton, where it leaves the main channel, runs from that

point westerly, nearly parallel to the Cheshire shore for a distance of six

miles, when it turns to the north-west and passes into the Bay by aa
outlet known as the Horse Channel, between a spit of the Great Burbo
and the East Hoyle Bank, which separates the water of the river

Mersey from that of the river Dee.

     Before the Crosby Channel with its bar entrance became stable and
pronounced, the Rock was the chief channel to and from the port, owing

Avider and deeper than at present, it having considerably deteriorated

outside the Bar. Out at sea, some eiglit miles from the Bar, a lightship
known as the North-west Lightship is moored, this being the first floating
light to be picked up by vessels making for the port. There are, however,
along the north coast of Wales, to as far as Holyhead, several light-
houses maintained at the expense of the port of Liverpool. Each
important station has its distinguishing light and fog-signal. In addition
to the lightships in the main channel, there are also a number of lighted
gas-buoys. The dredged cut at the Bar is also defined by two lighted
buoys on each side.

     The system of buoyage adopted in the sea channels of the Mersey
is that approved in 1883 by the Conference on Buoyage in Ports of the
CTnited Kingdom, of which Captain Graham Hills, R.N., then Marine
Surveyor to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, was a prominent
member.

     The width of the main channel varies in its several reaches, its deep-
water fairway being outlined by the buoys referred to, which are moored
to give a width of channel from 800 to 1,400 yards.

     Doubtless the several features are well understood and appreciated by
navigators, but they present such interesting characteristics as to render
them worthy of the attention even of land.smen and laymen unacquainted
with the locality. It will be evident from the foregoing necessarily very
general description that the main sea-channels of the Mersey being wide,
deep, thoroughly well buoyed and lighted, and provided with powerful
fog-horns at all the leading points, there is no difficulty in entering or
leaving the Mersey by day or night, which facility is essential in a sea-
port used by such an enormous number of vessels, of all sizes and classes,
as carry on its trade.

      Until a few years ago vessels arriving at the approaches to the port
occasionally ran some risk, and were, in some cases, subject to considerable
inconvenience through being compelled to wait in the open bay outside
the Bar until there was sufficient water over it to enable them to cross

safely. By the very extensive dredging operations carried out in recent
years, and to which the author now proposes to make some reference,

this difficulty has practically been entirely removed.
     It has been mentioned above that the main channel of the Mersey has

maintained its general features with regularity, so that the conditions
of navigation have remained practically uniform. This applies, amongst
other features, to the depth of water over the Bar, wliich has generally
under natural conditions been about 10 or 11 feet below low water of
spring tides. Sometimes in the course of changes it has been somewhat
greater or less. Assuming a depth on the Bar of 10 feet below low-water
springs, then, with the range of tide obtaining in Liverpool Bay, the
depth of water over the Bar at high water would scarcely ever be less than
.30 feet, and would vary between that and about 40 feet, so that at high
water (that is, about once every twelve hours) any vessel could enter
or leave the port. Doubtless, therefore, the measure of inconvenience

was not great when vessels were small and slow ; but in recent years,
where the size and speed of steamers have greatly increased, the detention
at the Bar of vessels arriving at or about low water became a serious

inconvenience, especially in the case of the ocean greyhounds carrying
a large number of impatient passengers.

     Previous to 1890 no attempt had been made to obtain by artificial

works more than the natural rleptli of water on the Bar, except that about

the year 1838, when the condition of the sea channels for navigation was

below the normal efficiency as regards depth and otherwise, Captain

Denham, the Marine Surveyor of that day, was authorised to harrow or

rake across the Bar in the channel then forming in the course of natural

Achanges at the outer end of the main channel.    sum of between 3,0001,

and 4,000^. was spent in this work, the precise effect of which is uncertain,

as in the course of nature a channel having the normal depth was formed

in this position and was adopted for navigation.

It must not be inferred that the subject of the Bar obstruction was

lost sight of through the period intervening between Captain Denham's

experiment and the commencement of practical work. On the contrary,

it had never ceased to be a source of anxiety to the authorities, and more

particularly, in recent years, to the Dock Board, and the author as their

engineer, and suggestions for its amelioration had from time to time been

under consideration.

There was, however, a natural and wise hesitation to tackle a question

that presented such formidable difficulties and responsibilities, both physi-

cal and financial, at all events unless and until there appeared a fair

prospect of obtaining successful and satisfactory results within reasonable

limits, both as regards time and expenditure.

    At New York, the western terminus of the great Atlantic ferry, in-

convenience arising from a similar cause had been felt, and after failure

of certain expedients, experiments by dredging the obstructed channel,

undertaken in 1885 and subsequent years, met with a considerable degree

of success. Although the problems were by no means the same, the

Newdifficulties at Liverpool being infinitely greater than those at  York,

the success at the latter port appeared to warrant an experiment on the

Bar at Liverpool, and it was accordingly decided to undertake an experi-

ment of some magnitude in dredging.

    Had the lowering of the Bar Ijeen dependent on the old-fashioned

bucket system of dredging, excellent as it is for some positions, experience

teaches that in this instance costly failure would have been inevitable.

The employment of the centrifugal pump as a dredger, which is a com-

paratively recent application, offered the best, and practically the only,

means of removing the Mersey Bar, which consists of sand of various

degrees of fineness. The author had made early experiments with the

centrifugal pump as a dredger, these being carried out after an examina-

tion which he made in 1876 of a plan he saw in practice in the sandy bed

of the river Loire in France, where he found a suction dredger at work

in clearing out the foundations for a bridge over that river. His first

attempt to adapt this principle to the work on the Dock Estate at Liver-

pool was by fitting up an old mud hopper barge with a centrifugal pump

and trailing suction-pipe, for the purpose of testing its ability to remove the

silty accumulation from the docks, and thus supersede the clumsy bucket

system which was found very inconvenient to work in such confined spaces,

and was costly.

This experiment, for the most part, failed by reason of the light

flocculent character of the material to be dealt with, and consequent im-

possibility to retain it within the hoppers, as also from the frequency of

foreign substances which had fallen into the docks, such as ropes, baskets,

bags, mats, and the like, choking and breaking down the suction pipes.
--ho6 REPORT 1896.

     The system, lio\ve\'er, gave such evidence of ultimate success (provided
the material was of a suitable character) that further experiments were
successfully made at that time on the sandbanks within the river. When,
therefore, there appeared a possibility of success warranting an experi-
ment in dredging the Mersey Bar, the experience in pump-dredging indi-
cated the method to be adopted, and the adaptation and use of two of the
Board's 500-ton steam hopper barges, followed in course by the construc-
tion and setting to work of the gigantic dredger Brancker, novel in many
features besides her size, of 3,000 tons capacity, and capable of filling
herself in about three-quarters of an hour, resulted in a notable ameliora-

tion of the condition of the Bar.

From a channel, having in 1890 a minimum depth of 11 feet at low

water of lowest tides between the fairway buoys, the Bar has now cut

through it a channel 1,500 feet wide between its buoyed alignments, with

--a minimum depth of 24 feet and so small a depth only in a few isolated
--patches over its area by far the greater portion ranging to a depth o£

28 feet.

It is fortunate that so important an improvement of the access to the

port has been secured at a time when the enormous growth in the size of

ships, the frequency of their voyages,. and the urgency of trade competi-

tion absolutely demanded some advance of the kind. This achievement

has not, of course, been attained without considerable expenditure, of

which the cost of the two 3,000- ton dredgers (the Brancker above referred

to having been followed by the G. B. Crow, of like capacity), which had to

be specially designed and constructed for the purpose, forms an important

item. The total quantity of sand removed to this date (September 1896)

and deposited in a safe position, whence it cannot return to its old site,

amounts to 15,511,390 tons, the actual cost of tlie operation being at the

Arate of \\d. per ton.  description of this work has been so fully and

exhaustively given in the paper read to the British Association last yeav

by the author's son and chief assistant, Mr. A. G. Lyster, that it is un-

necessary here to enlarge further on the subject beyond stating that since

last year costly additions have been made to the plant, which, by mini-

mising the chance of a breakdown, still better ensure a successful

issue.

    The subject of the tides may be considered as collateral to that of the

channels. They are another important feature in the welfare of the Port,

demanding some slight notice, and as a preliminary it may be well to

explain the standard by which local tides are measured.
     The datura level, long since arbitrarily adopted for all engineering

work in connection with the Mersey, is that of the level of the sill of the

first dock constructed, which has long since disappeared, but the level has

been transferred to the bench mark on the wall of one of the more
recently constructed pier-heads. This local datum is known as the ' Old
Dock Sill.'

     Several years ago a Committee of the British Association considered
closely its relation to other standard levels, and its relation to Ordnance
datum was then determined to be that the latter was 4'67 feet above Old

Dock Sill. It may be noted in passing that the Ordnance datum wa.s
settled from observation taken by Boyal Engineers of the mean level of
the sea at Liverpool during a certain month in the year 1841. The rela-
tions of a number of important tidal levels to Old Dock Sill, mostly taken

     The abnormally high range of tide in this locality, as shown by the

foregoing figures, is sufficiently interesting to warrant a brief explanation

of its causes. It is, shortly, due to the fact that a part of the great tidal
wave, generated in southern latitudes, enters St. George's Channel round
by the south of Ireland, and thence moves forward simultaneously in one
vast current throughout, to a position in the Irish Sea abreast of the Isle
of Man, where it meets that part of the ocean tide which passes by the
north of Ireland and turns southwardly with great velocity through the
North Channel by the Mull of Cantire. This meeting causes an up-
heaval of the tidal volume, which is transmitted laterally to such parts of

the adjoining coasts as are within its influence, the Bay of Liverpool
coming in for its share, and thus enabling it to project a tidal wave far up
the river Mersey to Woolston Weir, 33 miles from the mouth of the
river, and to Frodsham Bridge on the Weaver, 19 miles distant from the
same point. At these points the tidal flow is barred by weirs on both

rivers.

     The gross volume thus sent into the estuary has been calculated at

710,000,000 cubic yards on springs, and 281,000,000 cubic yards on neaps.

     It now remains to describe the share which man has taken to complete
'the benefits which Nature has so lavishly bestowed, and this may best

be done by a brief and necessarily very general description of the works
·and docks which have brought Liverpool into such prominence and active
"touch with the outside world.

     The major portion of the space upon which the Liverpool docks have
^3een constructed has been gained from time to time by inclosing the
<foreshore of the river. Its width varies from 2,300 feet, where back
'land was low lying, at the mouth of the river, to 700 feet in the centre
of the river frontage of the city, opposite the narrows of the river
558 REPORT--1896.

channel, and widening again to 1,100 feet at the southern extremity,
where, however, width has only been won by excavation of the steep,
rocky banks. The river wall fronting the Estate is continuous for

six miles from the mouth of the river opposite New Brighton to the

Bouthern extremity of the developed portion of the Estate.

     The enclosure thus effected with most of the works thereon, and the
expenditure incurred thereby, have been authorised from time to time by
Acts of Parliament.

     Beyond this enclosure additional adjoining land and foreshore have been
secured further south, and will admit of dock extensions when the necessi-
ties of trade demand increased accommodation. The total area of the
Board's Estate on the Liverpool side is 1,105 acres, of which 950 acres are
developed, the remaining area being brought only into partial use for dock

purposes.

     The first dock erected in Liverpool, already referred to, was towards
the centre of the system as now existing, on the site of the Old Pool, and
was constructed, under an Act obtained in 1708, from designs of Mr.
Thomas Steers, an eminent engineer of that day. It was only four acres
in area, and afforded accommodation for 100 small vessels. It was filled
in about seventy years ago, and the group of buildings forming the Custom
House, Post Office, and Dock Offices has been built on its site.

     The earlier docks were all constructed in the vicinity of the Old Dock,
but nearer to, and running parallel with, the river, and some of them
exist to this day, partly in their original form. They were designed and
carried out by Mr. John Foster and his son, who were then the Surveyors

to the Corporation.

     In 1824 the late Mr. Jesse Hartley took charge of the engineering of
the Dock Estate, the business of which was in those days administered by
the Corporation. Mr. Hartley occupied that honourable position with
singular success for the long period of thirty-six years, and died in 1860.
During the latter portion of his useful life he was assisted by his son,

Mr. John Bernard Hartley, who succeeded him as Engineer, but who,
owing to failing health, was shortly obliged to resign.

     Undoubtedly the prominent position of Liverpool among the commer-
cial centres of the world is largely due to the practical knowledge and
ability of these eminent engineers and the success of their achievements,
at a period when the science of engineering was but imperfectly under-
stood. This is universally acknowledged both in and out of the profession.

     In 1861 the author of this paper was appointed Engineer, and has
remained so ever since. It is, however, but right to say that for the last
six years Mr. A. G. Lyster has designed and carried out all the new works
subsequent to those of the Canada, Huskisson, and Sandon improvements,
which are the last with which the author has been prominently con-

cerned.

     The Hartleys designed and carried out most of that group of docks
extending from the Prince's to the Canada on the north, and from the
Salthouse to the Brunswick on the south, including the fine blocks of
Albert and Stanley warehouses, for the storage of general produce. These
docks all present features of great similarity, having been constructed to
suit the special classes of shipping and trades which in those days were
located in difierent positions along the Estate. They now require no

special description.
       ON THYSICAL AND ENGINEERING FEATURES OF THE MERSEY. o59

     Soon after the author took charge as Engineer, it became evident that
the days of sailing ships were numbered, trade and steam developing on
all sides, so that ships of greater size, with increased speed and draught,

became the ruling requirements to ensure successful trading.

    As a natural sequence, it was found that the older docks were rapidly
becoming obsolete for this new class of ship, so that docks of improved

type had to be specially designed and brought into use with all possible
despatch. Fortunately the foresight of the Dock Board had provided for

-- --this contingency by the large enclosure about 300 acres of foreshore they

had effected north of Canada Dock. An area of about 80 acres at the

southern end of the Estate also had for some years been waiting for

development.
     These lands were handed over to the author in order to prepare

desif^ns for furnishing them in some form to meet the new conditions, the
result being that the groups, north of Canada Basin, and known as the
Alexandra" system, at the North End, and the Herculaneum at the
south, including the Harrington, Toxteth, and Union Docks, were carried

out.

     The Parliamentary Estimates for the whole of these works amounted
to 4,100,000^. The main features of these schemes, both north and south,
were such as to afford ample and convenient accommodation for ships of
the largest class, in view at the time of their design, with facility of
ingress and egress to and from the docks, and approaches with entrances
as deep as the conditions of the river would safely justify ; also abundant
quay and water space, large shed accommodation, and all requisite
appliances for the rapid discharge of goods, combined with wide roadways
and convenient lines of railway in full connection with the main trunk

lines of the country. Fortunately the large area of the enclosure at the

north and the favourable condition of the river in the vicinity admitted

of these desiderata being obtained.

     The northern scheme comprised the extension and alteration of the

Canada Basin and its pierhead, with the lowering of the level of its
floor ; the formation of the Langton Half-tide dock, which was to be the
vestibule for the surrounding group ; two graving docks, each 950 feet
long ; a branch dock for repairing purposes ; a great steam dock with
three' branches, called the Alexandra; and a dock opening out of it
called the Hornby, being the northernmost dock on the Estate. The total
water area of this group amounts to 83 acres, having an aggregate
quayage of 23,700 lineal feet. The Parliamentary Estimates for this
section of docks amounted to 2,691,360/., within which they have been
completed. They were opened for traffic on September 8, 1881, by their

 Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales.
      In designing works of this important character one of the difficult

matters to successfully accomplish is that of effecting a simple and ready
 means of keeping the approaches, entrances, and dock sills clear of silt,
 with which the water of the Mersey is largely charged. This becomes all
 the more necessary where ships are large and valuable, and difficult where

 the sills are laid at abnormally low levels.
      In the case of this group the sills were laid at twelve feet below

 datum, being the deepest in the river with the exception of those pre-
 viously constructed at the northern entrances of the Birkenhead Docks.
 For the purpose of maintaining the required depth in the dock approaches
 a special arrangement of sluices of an elaborate character was designed.
560 - REPORT-- 189G.

and carried out, passing along and incorporated with the wing walls and
pierheads of the entrances and basin, and continuing along timber piers
projecting into the river, which structures, being of a heavy and substan-
tial character, materially assist the passage of ships into and out from the
docks. The result of this arrangement is that the fairway is daily swept
clear of all sandy accumulation, and kept in perfect working order, while
the entrances are thoroughly sheltered, even in heavy on-shore gales.

     It may not be out of place to mention that one of the most important

features of successfully working a dock system, particularly in a crowded
port like Liverpool, is facility of ingress and egress, especially at times of
heavy seas and bad weather, when big ships are difficult to handle and

keep under control.
     This matter received special attention, and the approaches and

entrances were carefully designed to meet that end. The result has been
satisfactory, no difficulty having been experienced with the new entrances,
and no accident of any moment having occurred during the fifteen years
that the docks have been in work. The responsible officer in charge of
this division has informed the author that, no matter what the, weather

is, whenever a ship-master considers it safe to leave his moorings in the
river, or his berth in the dock, he can enter or leave easily and safely by

way of Canada Basin. This is all the more satisfactory as in the incep-
tion of this North End scheme it was freely predicted that in bad weather

from the north-west the entrances would be dangerously exposed, if not

unapproachable with any degree of safety. An instance may be quoted

to illustrate the facility with which vessels are worked in and out of this

group of docks. On February 13, 1889, twenty-three steamships of an

aggregate of 34,197 tons and thirty-five smaller vessels passed in and
out during the working tide of two and a third hours. This, though an
excellent record, has no doubt been since exceeded, as during the seven
years that have elapsed the docks have been largely overcrowded. Since
their openmg in 1881 they have accommodated an immense amount of
the best steam shipping of the port.

     That part of the works at the South End also included in the Act of
1873 consists of a chain of three docks, known as the Harrington,

Toxteth, and Union Docks, extending from the Herculaneum Half-tide
towards the north, up to the old Brunswick Dock. Their sills are laid at
the level of 1 2 feet below datum throughout, and their main entrances
and wing walls at Herculaneum are provided with an elaborate system of
sluices, carried under a jetty on the river-side on the same principle as

that at the North End, but alongside the river wall instead of projecting
into the river. This has been the means of fully maintaining the sills and
fairway open and free from silt and preventing the tail of the Estuary

banks from approaching too near the entrances.
     The Herculaneum Half-tide Dock, which in its original form, with

two graving docks opening out of it southward, was constructed under
the Act of 1863, was, under the Act of 1873, greatly extended eastwardly,
and an additional graving dock was constructed alongside the other two.
These docks were cut out of the solid red sandstone rock, which
originally was much higher than the present quay level. Cliffs therefore
exist on the east and soutli sides of the dock, and in the face of these
have been excavated casemates separated by solid partitions of rock.

These casemates were designed for the storage of petroleum in barrels,

and are so used. Northward of the Herculaneum Dock the Estate is
ON PHYSICAL AXD EXGIXEERING FEATURES OF THE MERSEY 5G1

narrow, and consequently clocks on the Alexandra system, of a great

trunk with branches, could not be laid out ; but the Harrington and

Toxteth take the form of long docks of ample width, and are provided

with sheds of the most modern type, double storey, of moderate width, on

the eastern quays, and single storey, of exceptionally great width, on the

western. The Union Dock forms a connecting link between the new

·deep-water dock and the older group having comparatively shallow sills.

The total area of the docks from Herculaneum to Union inclusive is

32 acres, 3, .3 48 square yards, and the quayage 8,518 lineal feet, and the

Parliamentary Estimate for the works was 1,408,640^.

At night the entrances and passages throughout the new north and

south systems are lighted at tide-time by electric lights raised on tall

lattice masts, placed on the pierheads and standing 80 feet above the

quay level ; these being amongst the first introduced into England or

elsewhere for dock purposes, as far as the Author knows.

The sills of the older docks immediately north of the Union Dock, and

extending as far north as George's Dock, are laid at a level of about

--six feet below datum six feet higher than the Herculaneum-Union group.

These older docks could not, on neap tides, be available for vessels of,

say, more than 16 feet draught, and could therefore not be safely used on

neap tides by deep-draught modern vessels. To meet this difficulty, the

Author arranged that on such tides the water in the shallow group should

be impounded at such a level as to afford ample draught for all vessels, the

only disability from which they would suffer, and this is only of a trifling

nature, being that, if required to pass between river and docks on neap

tides, they would have to do so by way of the deep-water river entrances

at Herculaneum Dock, the Union Dock being used as a lock between the

old and new groups of docks. Inasmuch as there is a considerable

loss of water by leakage at dock gates, and culverts, and for tilling graving

docks, such loss must be made good if the water is to be maintained at a

constant level, and this is done by means of a powerful installation of

centrifugal pumps, situate at the Coburg Dock, which are used to pump

water from the River Mersey into the Coburg Dock, from which it dis-

tributes itself throughout the system. By these means the effective depth

of the whole of the docks from Brunswick to George's, having an area

of about 80 acres, is practically increased to that of the lowest sills

leading to them, 12 feet below Old Dock Sill, and much detention of

vessels and consequent loss are avoided, which could not be done in any

other way, except by the reconstruction of the old docks, the cost of which

would be immense, while that of the pumps is moderate, say, some 3,000/.

per annum.

   A pumping scheme of this character was first adopted by the Author

in the case of the Sandon Graving Docks, of which there is a group of

six, opening out of the Sandon Dock, constructed in 1851, and which, owing

to the increase in the draught of ships, which prevented them entering

the shallow graving docks on neap tides, had become much less useful to

the Port than they formerly had been. Pumps were therefore provided

of sufficient power to raise the water in the docks to such height as might

be required by any individual ship, to pass her over the sill of any of the

graving docks, and so the graving docks were made fully available for
any ship which could enter the dock from which they opened, the sill of
which was much lower than those of the graving docks. The success of

this experiment warranted the extension of the system, and so it was

1896.                                                     oo

applied to the Brunswick-George's group, and, afterwards, also adopted

at Birkenhead, where the area to be deepened v/as about 150 acres, and

the difference between the outer and inner sills three feet.

In the case of each of these installations it is necessary to do the

pumping in a short time at and about liigh water, therefore the machinery

is of a very powerful character. At the Sandon there are four pumps,

each having suction pipes 36 inches diameter, and the Coburg and

Birkenhead installations each consist of three pumps having 54-inch suc-

tion pipes. Some idea of the work done may be formed when it is noted

that the discharge of each of the two last-named sets is about equal to

that of the River Thames at Teddington. They have now been at work
for many years without hitch of any kind. In referring to these schemes,

only bare facts are given, details being purposely omitted as unnecessarily

encumbering a Paper of this general character.

The works carried out under the Act of 1873 added about 41 per

cent, to the dock accommodation previously existing on the Liverpool

side of the River, and this of a class much better suited than the older

docks for modern requirements ; but, notwithstanding this fact, and that
the pumping schemes above mentioned provided much additional accom-

modation for deep-draught vessels, the necessities of the largest class of

steamers in the Port are ever pressing, and the Author is now, and has been

for some time past, carrying out a design for very important alterations

and additions to the group of docks immediately south of the Langton-

Alexandra system. The works comprised in the complete scheme are as

follov/s : the alteration by deepening and lengthening of the entrance

from the  Canada  Basin into Canada Dock                                                                                               straightening  of  the  walls of
                                                                                                                                    ;

Canada Dock and deepening of berths there ; the construction of a new

Branch dock out of Canada Dock as altered ; a new Half-tide dock to

serve as a vestibule to the improved system and having deep-water river

entrances ; and the construction of a new large and wide graving dock.
     The work of altering Canada Lock, though apparently trifling, has in

reality been of considerable magnitude and exceedingly diihcult of execu-

tion. It meant the cutting out of the masonry at the bottom of a lock

600 feet long by 100 feet broad, and providing a new floor at a level of

6 feet 3 inches lower than before, without disturbing or letting in the

side walls, which had to be underpinned for a depth of about 10 feet.

The excellence of the granite masonry of which it had been con-

structed made it doubly difficult and costly, as it was the late Mr. Jesse

Hartley's last work, and indeed his chef d'ceuvre, and the Author, com-

pelled to interfere with such a substantial model of excellent workmanship,

did so regretfully. The work, however, has been substantially completed

without accident, and ships are now daily passing to and fro through it.

Considerable and costly alterations have also been carried out within

the Canada Dock, in taking down and rebuilding in straight and con-

tinuous foi-m the old walls of contorted shape, originally built so as to

allow of the construction of Huskisson Battery, and quite unsuited for the

berthage of modern ships. The large Transatlantic steamers of the

Cunard Line now berth at the straightened west wall.

This work was rendered more difficult and expensive in consequence

of its being necessary to keep the water within the docks so as not to

allow trade to be interfered -^vith.

The new branch out of the Canada, giving a large amount of extra

accommodation to the Port, has also been completed. This dock is 1,085
        ox PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING FEATURES OF THE MERSEY. oG3

feet in length by 300 feet in width, and has an aggregate quayage of
 2,469 feet, amply provided with single and double storey sheds of large
 size with improved crane appliances. The White Star Company occupy
berths on the north and south sides of this dock, and there their largest

 steamers lie.

     In connection with the Canada a new passage 90 feet in width, with a

bridge over, lias been constructed, to join up with the Huskisson system.
     The new Half-tide Dock occupies the site of Sandou Basin and

"Wellington Half-tide Dock, and will afford room for a large number of
great vessels. The sills of the river entrances are laid at a much lower
level than any of the existing docks, viz., 20^ feet below Old Dock Sill,

so that vessels of the deepest draught will be able to enter and leave the

Half-tide on any tide in the year. On neap tides this dock will be used

as a lock for vessels passing between the River and docks, which latter

will on such tides be maintained on the impounded system, powerful
pumps being provided in positions near to the Half tide dock.

     The new Graving Dock, 920 feet long, will be constructed out of the
east quay of Canada Dock immediately north of the Branch Dock.

     Having now described the dock extensions most recently constructed
and in hand at Liverpool, the Author will, before mentioning the accom-

modation provided for some of the most noteworthy trades, refer shortly

to the history of that portion of the Mersey Dock Estate situate on the

Cheshire shore at Birkenhead.

     In 1855 the dock authorities of that day applied for Parliamentary
powers to extend their docks on the Lancashire side of the river. This
was only partially acceded to, and, in lieu of powers for their complete
proposal, it was arranged that the Birkenhead Docks, then belonging to
two independent authorities and only partially developed, should be

purchased by the Liverpool Corporation, who in those days administered
the affairs of the Liverpool Estate. Two years later the administration
of the combined Liverpool and Birkenhead Estates was handed over to an
independent Trust to be called ' The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.'
The Birkenhead system, therefore, now forms an integral portion of the
Mersey Dock Estate, and is worked in complete unison with the Liverpool

system.

     The Birkenhead Docks are constructed on the site of a tidal creek,
known as "Wallasey Pool, which extended inland for about two miles from
the left bank of the River, and formerly was the outlet of the drainage of
the low lands of the Leasowes, lying between the Dee and the Mersey.
The original design, by the late emment engineer, Mr. James Meadows
Rendel, F.R.S., having been partially carried out, was mainly completed
on the same lines by Mr. John Hartley, who, however, introduced several
important alterations when it came into Dock Board hands.

     The main features of the scheme were two large docks, called the East
and West Floats, of 1 20 acres in area, occupying a large portion of the
pool, the connection between these docks and the River being by means of
a lock, and a half-tide dock called the Alfred, the sills of which, at the
Float end, are nine feet below datum, and at the River end twelve feet

below.

    On taking charge of the engineering of the Estate in 1861, the Author
carried out these works to completion, but made several important altera-
tions in Mr. Hartley's design, unnecessary now to particularise. In con-

sequence of the entire area of the Float, East and West, being excavated

                                                                                                                                                  2
564 EEPORT-- 1896.

only to a depth of nine feet below datum, it has been found inconveniently     I
shallow for large modern ships on neap tides, to rectify which the pumping
scheme before referred to has been adopted.

     Towards the middle of the Liverpool Estate, the Author, about twenty-
five years ago, designed and carried out %,n important system of docks,
known as the Waterloo group. They consist of two docks, each running
parallel with the river, and approached from the south through the Prince's
Half-tide dock, which formed part of the design. The easternmost dock is
surrounded on three sides by warehouses of a very extensive character,
having a total length of 1,500 feet. They, with a similar group at
Birkenhead, were especially constructed for the storage of grain, which at
that time was beginning to come into the Port in large quantities. The
combined floor area of the two sets of warehouses is twenty-three acres,
and they are capable of storing upwards of 400,000 quarters. They are
equipped with a novel and elaborate system of machinery, specially de-
signed for facilitating the rapid discharge of ships, and for housing, trans-
mitting, and delivering grain, not only in the warehouse, but also from
ship to quay. This system has since everywhere become the recognised
means of dealing with grain under similar conditions.

     The import of live cattle from abroad, chiefly the United States and
Canada, has of late years assumed very large proportions, and a Foreign
Animals' Wharf, with extensive lairages and slaughter-houses, and other
necessary adjuncts have been provided. These were the first constructions
of the kind in the country, and have been increased from time to time
until they now occupy twenty-two acres ; the lairages or stables are suffi-
cient to accommodate about 8,000 head of cattle, and a vast number of
sheep, the number of cattle wliich passed through the wharf last year
having been about 200,000, and the number of sheep about 500,000. The
landing of the cattle is effected at two floating stages, alongside of which
cattle-ships can berth o.t most states of the tide. These stages are moored
in the River abreast of the walls, to which they are connected by bridges
formed of girders about 150 feet long. The accommodation thus afforded
amounts to 850 feet of lie-by. Special cattle runs are laid from the stage

to lead into the lairages.

     At Liverpool, the Coal Trade of the Port is well provided for on a
high-level structure, midway of the Estate, standing on and above the east

quays of the Bramley-Moore and Wellington Docks, and north quay of
the former. It is abundantly supplied with the most modern appliances,
viz. hydraulic cranes, and an elaborate and extensive system of sidings
and main lines in direct communication with the Lancashire and Yorkshire
 Coal- fields. The shipment by this Railway last year amounted to 809,000
tons. Recently a 25 -ton hydraulic crane has been erected on the east
quay of Herculaueum Dock, chiefly for Lancashire and Yorkshire coal for

ships' bunkers.

     At Birkenhead an important system of sidings and coal-hoists has
been constructed on the south quay of the West Float. These are worked

in connection with the coal-fields of North and South Wales, and add
materially to the trade and commerce of the Port ; an average of 1 ,190,000
 tons being annually brought to the docks for export and the use of steam-

 ships.

      The petroleum trade has of late years become so important as to
 require a large amount of accommodation in the immediate vicinity of the
 docks. In addition to the storage space provided in the casemates exca-
       ON PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING FEATURES OF THE MERSEY. 565

vated in the solid i-ock at Herculaneum Dock, to which reference has been
made, and which afforded thoroughly safe accommodation for 60,000
barrels, extensive provision for the storage of petroleum in bulk has been
made by the erection on some of the undeveloped land at the southern end
of the Liverpool Estate of a group of five tanks, varying in capacity from
2,000 to 3,000 tons, and having a total capacity of 12,500 tons.

     They are supplied from the ocean-going tank vessels, berthed alongside
the west quay of the Herculaneum Dock, the connection being by means
of pipes through which the oil is forced by the ships' pumps. Precautions
against fire are taken, and each tank stands in a moat of capacity sufficient
to hold the whole contents of the tank in case of accident. Railways are
laid in connection with each installation.

     At Birkenhead, on land belonging to the Dock Board, there are large

dep6ts for the storage of petroleum in bulk close to the docks. They
belong to the Anglo-American Oil Company, Limited, and have a total

capacity of 18,000 tons. Precautions against fire, similar to those at the
Liverpool depot, have been adopted also in these cases.

      Extensive warehouses for the storage of ordinary goods, also for the
special storage of tobacco, have been erected in various positions along the
Estate, the aggregate floor area of which is about ninety acres. Improved
buildings of an extensive character for the storage and display of wool

and tobacco are now in course of erection, from the designs of Mr. A. G.

Lyster.

     The Timber Trade of the Port is located at the north end of tlie
Estate, where large areas are occupied as storage ground and enclosed

yards.

     The handling of the immense quantities of goods of all sorts in their
transit across the Dock Estate is a very important matter, but scarcely
more than a passing reference to the appliances required for this purpose

and for working the bridges, gates, capstans, &c., can be given. It may

be said, however, that in addition to a large amount of machinery worked
by hand-power, and to the steam-power available on the steamers now
forming the great majority of the sea-carriers, there are provided by the
Dock Board a large number of steam and hydraulic cranes, including a
100-ton hydraulic crane, and a 90-ton steam crane, fixed on dock quays,
a floating steam crane capable of lifting 100 tons under certain restrictions,
and any load up to 30 tons freely, and another floating steam crane of
25-ton power. For the maintenance of the docks, and River channels,
a large fleet of dredgers of all types, and hopper barges for carrying

dredged material to sea, are provided.

     Hydraulic power is largely made use of for working bridges, gates,
capstans, &c. ; centres of hydraulic power being established at a great
many different points at Liverpool and Birkenhead.

     The means of communication between the Dock Estate and the
adjoining Towns, and between the several parts of the Estate itself, for
goods and people, are various and ample.

     The development of the City of Liverpool has steadily kept pace with
that of the docks, and the interchange of traffic between them is carried
on by means of a wide street traversing the whole length of the Estate
from north to south, upon which the side streets abut. This thorough-
fare is of suflScient width to allow of a double line of railway being laid
along its margin throughout, communicating, where necessary, with lines
along the dock quays, and also with several railway systems, which have
566 EEPOKT-- 189G.

their goods termini adjoining. There are in all about fifteen stations

along this six-mile length, divided among the London and North-Western,
Lancashire and Yorkshire, Cheshire lines. Midland, Great Northern,
Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire, and Great Western Railways,
some of which, however, having no direct rail access to Liverpool, have

depots for the interchange of traffic with their fully developed systems
at Bii'kenhead.

    For many years a service of large omnibuses traversed the dock lines,

from north to south and vice verso, every ten minutes throughout the
day, and thus added considerably to the convenient working of the

Estate.

     As, however, the docks extended, this arrangement was found to be
inconvenient and insufficient for the wants of the community, and the
Author designed an Overhead Railway to be erected at the level of
16 feet above the street lines, with spans standing on slender wrought-
iron columns, so as to offer as little impediment as possible to the under-
neath street traffic. Twenty-three stations, approached by easy stairs,
were designed to be erected along the line in convenient positions to
some of the side streets.

     It was further designed that it should be worked by electricity, that
being the simplest arrangement for a railway in such a situation. The
plans were all matured for the construction of the work, and tenders were
on the eve of being invited, when the Dock Board, as a final decision,
concluded that, considering the great labour and responsibility of admi-
nistering an Estate of such magnitude as that of the Docks, it would be
somewhat anomalous to undertake in addition such duties as those of
directing a passenger railway which was likely to develop to great magni-
tude. They therefore entered into an arrangement with a syndicate,
who undertook the work, which, to the designs and under the able
engineering direction of Sir Douglas Fox and Mr. James Henry
Greathead, has been most satisfactorily carried out to completion, and
now forms not only a most interesting engineering work, but a valuable
public convenience, daily becoming of greater magnitude and importance.

     The Mersey Tunnel railway, an important work which has added

very materially to the facilities of the passenger cross-river traffic, as
well as in effect linking up for passenger purposes the railway systems

of the Lancashire and Cheshire sides of the River, was carried out from
the designs of Sir James Brunlees and Sir Douglas Fox, and has since
been in full and constant use.

      The construction of the Tunnel presented considerable difficulties
which were very successfully overcome by the Engineers.

      Several canal systems, from up the River, work in connection with
the Dock Estate, and are important adjuncts to the trade of the Port,
the entrance to the docks being generally arranged to meet their special
tidal requirements. The only one, however, which has a direct communi-
cation with the docks is the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, which traverses
the country to the north of Liverpool, and is in direct communication
with the manufacturing and mineral centres of Lancashire and York-

shire.

      In the foregoing sketchy narrative of the Mersey and its great Sea-
port, the Author has been unwillingly compelled, by the exigencies which

a Paper of this description imposes upon him, to exclude many matters

of great interest, even a descriptive outline of Garston, Widnes, Elles-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                .

mere Port, and, though last in time by no means least in magnitude, the
Ship Canal, with its entrance at Eastham and great terminal dock system
at Slanchester, each and all of which not only add to the importance of
the River, and the trade which it fosters in its ample embrace, but also
give substantial evidence of the commercial activity of our common
country, and, as such, are well worthj' of enlarged, if not exhaustive, com-
ment. Time forbids more than this passing notice, which the Author

trusts will be sufficient apology for not dwelling ujDon them.

     While ships generally, at Liverpool, are discharged, on account of the
great range of the tide, in enclosed docks, which are open to the River
only at high water, the necessary means of access to boats at all states
of tlie tide, for communication between shore and shore, or with boats in
the River, is for the most part affi^)rded by the Floating Landing Stages,
which form a stiiking feature of the riverscape. The first stage at
Liverpool, the George's, 500 feet long, was constructed about 1847, and
the Prince's, 1,000 feet long, was constructed about 1857 ; the stages on

the Cheshire shore followed these.

     The two stages on the Liverpool side, formerly separated from each
other by a length of 500 feet for the purpose of retaining the entrance
into the old George's Basin, are now joined together, and form one con-
tinuous structure, 2,463 feet in length, 400 feet having been recently
added from the designs and under the superintendence of Mr. A. G.
Lyster. The northern extremity of the stage abuts on to a timber jetty

joined with the south pierhead of the Prince's Half-tide Dock, to be used
to facilitate the landing of cattle from Ireland and other outside ports.
The Liverpool stage is connected with the shore by a series of girder
bridges, and also by a floating roadway in the form of a bi-idge of boats,
constructed on the site of the George's Basin, and which, at low water,
rests on a stone slipway, having an inclined surface of 1 in 20, enabling

the bridge to be easily traversed by wheel traffic. At high water it is

all afloat.

     The additional 400 feet lately added to the stage has facilitated the
arrangement of the Dock Board for berthing the great Atlantic liners
alongside the stage for the purpose of landing or taking on board their
passengers, which had been discontinued for some twenty years, and
which can now be eSected at practically all states of the tide, and in an
expeditious and efiectual manner. Thus the old and inconvenient method
of landing by means of tenders has been done away with, to the great
advantage of the travelling public.

      Convenient examining rooms for the use of the Customs have long
been erected at the back of the stage, adjoining these berths, so that
little delay occurs in the transit of passengers and their baggage.

      In connection with this a very important additional improvement has
 lately been carried out, in order to render passenger service as expeditious
and convenient as possible, by the erection of a capacious railway station
on the quay adjoining, and running parallel with, the stage, thus bringing
the outgoing passengers alongside their ships, and the incoming vice versa.
This station is in direct communication with the London and North-
Western Railway. The arrangements have been designed and carried out
by Mr. A. G. Lyster.

     On the Birkenhead side of tlie River the Dock Board have constructed
a landing-stage, known as the Woodside Stage, 800 feet in length, 300

feet of which is vested in the Birkenhead Corporation. The remainder is
568 REPORT-- 183G.

in use for general dock purposes, chiefly for the landing of cattle. Con-

venient bridges connected with the quays and a floating roadway, similar

Ato that at Liverpool, have been provided for wheel trafiic.  second

stage, half a mile further north, has also been provided for general pur-

poses, but is chiefly used by cattle ships.

   A large amount of dredging is involved in keeping the docks on both

sides of the River clear of silty deposit, and different kinds of dredgers are
in use for that purpose. The material removed is chiefly composed of flne

silt and mud, and is conveyed to the sea by steam hopper barges and

deposited in positions indicated, on behalf of the Conservancy Commis-

sioners, by their Acting Consei-vator, Admiral Sir George Richards,

K.C.B., F.R.S.

The total area of the Estate, Ijoth at Liverpool and at Birkenhead,

amounts to 1,611 acres, subdivided into 546 acres of water space, made

up of docks, half-tide docks and basins, surrounded by 35 miles of quays,

warehouses, and sheds, with an aggregate floor area of over 150 acres, the
remainder being made up of timber-yards, shipbuilding-yards, open quays

and streets, with a residue of undeveloped land and foreshore. The unde-

veloped portion of the Estate includes a large area of foreshore, amounting

to about 200 acres at Tranmere, about one mile further up the river than

Woodside. This has lately been acquired by the Board for future dock

extension whenever the trade of the Port demands it.

The total number of graving docks belonging to the Mersey Docks and

Harbour Boards is twenty-three, having an aggregate length of 14,920 feet

of floor.

The total number of ships which entered the Port and paid tonnage

rates for the year ending July 1, 1896, was 23,695, having a net toimage

of 11,046,459. In this figure the tonnage in or out only is represented.

The total revenue of the Estate from all sources is about 1,400,000/.

per annum.
     The aflTairs of the Dock Trust are administered by a body named the

Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, with a number of members fixed by Act

of Parliament at 28, of whom 24 are elected by tlie Dock ratepayers, the

remaining four being nominee members ai:>pointed by the Mersey Con-

servancy Commissionei's.

This important body consists of the First Lord of the Admiralty, the

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the President of the Board of
Trade, who are represented by an Acting Conservator. That position is
now and has been for some years ably filled by Admiral Sir George

Richards, K.C.B., F.R.S. The Commissioners are appointed under the

authority of Parliament to preserve the navigation of the Mersey, from

Warrington and Frodsham bridges to the sea.

     In submitting a Paper of this general character, the Author has been
compelled, from the extent and variety of the subjects he has touched
upon, to do so in the briefest possible manner, with a view to explaining
the general features of the Dock Estate and its surroundings, rather than
dwell upon derails and special works of interest with which the history of
the Estate abounds, and which, to be properly dealt with and understood,
would require a lengthy paper to themselves.
ON THE NOIlT^T^VESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.  569

--The Korih- Weslem Trihes oj Canada. Eleventh Report of the Com-

     mittee, cons'stivq of Professor E. B. Tylor (Chairman), Mr.
     CuTHBEKT E. Peek (Secretary), Dr. G. M. Dawson, Mr. R. G.
     Halibukton, and Mr. Horatio Hale, a'pfninted to investigate th&
     Physical Characters, Langucujes, and Industrial and Social Condi-
      tions of the North-Western Tribes of the Bominion of Canada.

The Committee were originally appointed at the Montreal Meeting of the

Association in 1884, and, as indicated in the Tenth Eeport, presented last-
year at the Ipswich Meeting, it had been determined that that Report

should conclude the series. When, however, it was decided to hold the
meeting for 1897 in Toronto, it appeared to be appropriate that the work
of the Committee begun at the tirst Canadian Meeting should be con-
cluded at the second, and the Committee were accordingly continued.
The concluding Report of the Committee to be prepared for the Toronto
Meeting may afi'ord the occasion of pointing out to the Government and
public of Canada the necessity for further and systematic investigation of

the ethnology of the country.

     The Report presented herewith contains a number of observations by
Dr. Franz Boas, through whose agency the greater part of the work has
been done, chiefly supplementary to articles contained in the Fifht and
Tenth Reports. Although the result of previous journeys by Dr. Boas,

these have not been heretofore published.

     It is now hoped to include in the final Report of 1897 the results of
further field work in contemplation and to be directed toward the filling

of some gaps still existing in our general knowledge of the tribes of
British Columbia, particularly in respect to the anthropometric observa-

tions, which, in Dr. Boas' hands, have already yielded results of so much

interest.

   Sixth Report on the Indians of British Columbia. By Franz Boas.

     The following pages contain notes that were collected by me on pre-

vious journeys to the North Pacific coast. They supplement mainly the
data on the Kwakiutl Indians, given in the Fifth Report of the Com-
mittee, and those on the Nass River Indians in the Tenth Report of the

Committee.
      There still remain two important gaps in our general knowledge of

 the ethnology of the North Pacific coast. In order to fill these, further
 anthropometric investigations on the Haida and He'iltsuk- and ethno-
logical and linguistic researches among the He'iltsuk- would be required.

When these have been added to the data gathered heretofore, it will be

 possible to give a fairly satisfactory general outline of the anthropology of

British Columbia.

                                I. Notes on the Kwakiutl.

      The Kwakiutl tribes speaking the Kwakiutl dialect call themselves
by the general name of Kwd'kwakyewak'. The following notes refer to
 this group, more particularly to the tribes living at Fort Rupert.
 .70 . REPORT-- 1896.

                                            THE SHAMANS.

     The shamans are initiated by animals, supernatural beings, or by
inanimate objects. The killer whale, the wolf, frog, and black bear are
the most potent animals which have the power of initiating shamans.
The cannibal spirit BaqbakualanuQsI'wae (see Fifth Report, p. 850), the
warrior's spirit Wina'lagyilis, the fabulous sea bear Na'nis, the sea monster
Me'koatEm or K'elk-'a'yuguit, the ghosts, the hemlock-tree, and the quartz

may also initiate them. Shamans who were initiated by the killer whale

or by the wolf are considered the most powerful ones. Only innocent
youths can become shamans.

   A person who is about to become a shaman will declare that he feels

ill. For four days or longer he fasts in his house. Then he dreams that
the animal or spirit that is going to initiate him appeared to him and
promised to cure him. If he has dreamt that the killer whale appeared
to him, he asks his friends to take him to a small island ; in all other
cases he asks to be taken to a lonely place in the woods. His friends
dress him in entirely new clothing, and take him away. They build a
small hut of hemlock branches, and leave him to himself. After four days

all the shamans go to look after him. When he sees them approaching,

--he begins to sing his new songs and tells them that the killer whale or
--whatever being his protector may be has cured him and made liim a

shaman by putting quartz into his body. The old shamans place him on
a mat, and wrap him up like a corpse, while he continues to sing his songs.
They place him in their canoe, and paddle home. The father of the
young person is awaiting them on the beach, and asks if his child is alive.

They reply in the affirmative, and then he goes to clean his house. He

must even clean the chinks of the walls, and he must take particular care

that no trace of the catamenial flux of a woman is left in any part of the

house. Then he calls the whole tribe. The singers arrange themselves
in the rear of the house, while the others sit around the sides. For a few
minutes the singers beat the boards which are laid down in front of them,
and end with a long call : yoo. This is repeated three times. Then the
new shaman begins to sing in the canoe, and after a short time he appears
in the house, dressed in head-ring and neck-ring of hemlock branches, his
eyes closed, and he dances, singing his song. Four times he dances around
the fire. During this time the singing master must learn his song. After
the dance the new shaman leaves the house again and disappears in the
woods. In the evening the people begin to beat the boards and to sing the
new song of the shaman which they had learned from him in the morning.
 Then he reappears and dances again with closed eyes. This is repeated

for three nights. On the fourth night when the people begin to sing for
him he appears with open eyes. He wears a ring of red cedar bark, to
which a representation of the animal that initiated him is attached. He
Carries a rattle on which the same animal is carved. He looks around,
and says to one of the people : ' You are sick.' It is believed that the
shaman can look right through man and see the disease that is in him.

 Then he makes his first cure.

     The power of shamanism may also be obtained by purchase. The
intending purchaser invites the shaman from whom he is going to buy

 the power and the rest of the tribe to his house. There the people sing
 and the shaman dances. During his dance he throws his power into

the purchaser, who falls down like one dead, and when he recovers is

taken by the shaman into the woods, where both stay for four days.

Then he returns, and the same ceremonial is performed that has been

described before.

When the shaman has singled out a person whom he declares to be

sick, he proceeds with the following performance : He carries a small

bundle  of  bird's  down  hidden  under his                                                                      upper  lip.  He lets the sick
                                                                                                              .

person lie down, and feels his body until he finds the seat of the disease.

Then he begins to suck at the part where the sickness is supposed to be
seated, while the people beat the boards and sing his song. Three
times he endeavours to suck out the disease, but in vain. The fourth

time, after having sucked, he puts his hands before his face and bites the

inside of his cheek so that blood flows and gathers in the down that

he is can-ying in his mouth. Then he takes it unnoticed from his mouth,

Nowfind hides it in his hands.    he begins to suck again, holding his

hands close to that part of the body where the disease is supposed to be
.seated. Then he removes them, blows on them, and on opening his
hands the bloody ball of down is seen adhering to the palm of the
shaman. After a short while he closes his hands again, applies them

once more, and shows one or four pieces of quartz, which he is supposed

to have removed from the body of the sick person. Then he closes his

hands again, and upon a renewed application produces the feathers, which .

he declares to be the soul of the patient. He turns his hands palm down-

ward, so that the ball adheres to his hand. If it becomes detached and

falls down, it signifies that the patient will die an early death. If the

ball adheres, he will recover.

     For four months the shaman continues to make cures similar to the

one described here. Every fourth day he must bathe. After this time

people whom he treats are expected to pay him for his services.

     It is forbidden to pass behind the back of a shaman while he is

eating, because it is believed that he would then eat the soul of the
person passing him in this manner. The person as well as the shaman

would fall in a swoon. Blood flows from the shaman's mouth, because
the soul is too large for him and is tearing him. Then the clan of the

person whose soul he has swallowed must assemble and sing the song of

the shaman. The latter begins to move, and vomits blood, which he tries

to hold in his hands. After a short time he opens his palms, and shows
a small bloody ball, the soul which he had swallowed. Then he rises,
while the person whose soul he had swallowed is placed on a mat in the

rear of the house. The shaman goes around the fire, and finally throws

the soul at its owner. Then he steps up to him, blows upon his
head, and the person recovers. It is said that the shaman in this
case also bites his cheek and hides some bird's down in his mouth, which

soaks up the blood and is made to represent the soul. The person whose
soul was swallowed must pay four or five blankets for the harm he has
done to the shaman, and for his own cure.

The protector of a shaman informs him if an epidemic should be

about to visit the tribe. Then he warns the people, and in order to

avert the danger lets them go through the following ceremony. He

resorts to a lonely place in the woods for one day. In the evening the

people assemble in his house and beat the boards three times. When

they begin to beat the boards the fourth time, he enters, wearing a large

ring of hemlock branches. It is believed that the souls of unborn
children and also those of deceased members of the tribe are hanging
572 REPORT--1896.

on the branches of the ring, ten to each branch. He talks to them, and
brushes them off from the ring. When he enters another shaman goes

to meet him, and strews bird's down on to the ring and on the shaman's
head. Then the latter walks around the fire, and stays in the rear of the

house. Now every member of the tribe must go to him, and he ' puts

them through the ring.' The person who is thus cleansed must extend
his right hand first, and put it through the ring, which is then passed
over his head, and down along the body, which is wiped with the ring.

When the ring has almost reached the feet of the person, the latter must

turn to the left, and step out of it with his right foot first, turn on that
foot, take out the left foot and turn once more to the left, standmg on

the left foot. Every member of the tribe is made to pass through
the ring. It is believed that this is a means of preventing the outbreak
of the epidemic. Sick persons must pass through the ring four times.
Nobody is allowed to speak or to laugh during this pei'formance. After
the shaman has finished, he speaks to the people, making statements
intended to show them that he knows even their most secret thoughts.

     The shaman wears his neck-ring of red cedar bark all the time.
     Powerful shamans are able to transform stones into berries.
    Their dance is so powerful that the ground gives way under their
steps, and they disappear underground.

    The husband of an enceinte woman in the seventh month of preg-

nancy prepares to insure an easy delivery by collecting the following
four medicines : four tentacles of a squid, a snake's tail, four toes of a
574 REPORT-- 1896.

toad, and seeds of Peucedanum leiocarpuni, Nutt. If the birth should

prove to be hard, these objects are charred, powdered, and drunk by the
mother. The toad's toes are also moved downward along her back.
This is called ' making the child jump ' {dd'yuqste). It is worth re-

marking that Peucedanimi leiocarpuni is used as a powerful medicine

also by the Salisli tribes of Vancouver Island (see Sixth Report of the

Committee, 1890, p. 577), who call the plant k'Eqme'n, while the Kwakiutl

call it k-'aqmcn. Judging from the form of the word, I think that it is

rather Salish ^han Kwakiutl. Certainly the belief in the power of this

plant was transmitted from one tribe to the other.

During the period of pregnancy the husband must avoid to encounter

squids, as this would have the effect of producing a hard delivery.

When the woman is about to be confined, she leaves the house accom-

panied by two of her friends who are to assist her. The latter dig a hole

in the ground, and one of them sits down on the edge of the hole,

stretching her legs across it so that her feet and the calves of her

legs rest on the opposite edge. Then she spreads her legs, and the woman
who is about to be confined sits down on her lap, straddling her legs so
that both her feet hang down in the pit. The two women clasp each
other's arms tightly. The third woman squats behind the one who is

about to be confined, pressing her knees against her back and embracing

her closely, so that her right arm passes over the right shoulder, her left

arm under the left arm of her friend. The child is allowed to lie in the

pit until after the afterbirth has been borne. Then the navel string is

tied and cut, and the child is taken up.
AFor four days the afterbirth is kept in the house.
                                                     twig of yew

wood about four inches long is pointed and pushed into the navel string,

which is then tied up. Four layers of cedar bark are wrapped around

the afterbirth. That of boys is in most cases buried in front of the

house-door. That of girls is buried at high-water mark. It is believed

that this will make them expert clam-diggers. The afterbirth of boys is

sometimes exposed at places where ravens will eat it. It is believed that

then the boys will be able to see the future.

The navel string is believed to be a means of making children expert

in various occupations. It is fastened to a mask or to a knife, which are

then used by a good dancer or carver, as the case mny be. Then the child

will become a good dancer or carver. If it is desired to make a boy a good

singer, his navel string is attached to the baton of the singing master.

Then the boy calls every morning on the singing master while he is taking

his breakfast. The singing master takes his baton and moves it once down

the right side of the boy's body, then down the left side ; once more
down the right side, and once more down the left side. Then he gives the

child some of his food. This, it is believed, will make him a good singer.

I referred in the Fifth (p. 847) and Sixth (p. 614) Reports to the beliefs

in regard to twins. I have received the following additional information

in regard to this subject. Four days after the birth of twins, mother and

father must leave the village and resort to the woods, where they stay for

a prolonged period. They separate, and each must pretend to be married

to a log, with which they lie d^wn every night. They are forbidden to

touch each other. They must not touch their hair. Every fourth day

they bathe, rub their bodies with hemlock twigs, and wipe them with

white shredded cedar bark. Tlieir faces are painted red all the time. For

this purpose they do not use vermilion, but ochre. They are not allowed
ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                      575

to do any work. These practices are continued for a period of sixteen

months. During this pei'iod they must not borrow canoes or paddles

from other people ; they must use bucket and dishes of their own. If
they should use the belongings of other persons, the latter would have

also twin children. The woman must not dig clams and the man must

not catch salmon, else the clams and the salmon would disappear. They

must not go near a fire in which bracken roots are being roasted. It is

believed that the birth of twins will produce permanent backaches in the

parents. In order to avert this, the man, a short time after the birth,

induces a young man to have intercourse with his wife, while she in turn

procures a girl for her husband. It is believed that then the backache

Awill attack them.  year after the birth of the twins the parents put

wedges and hammers into a basket, which they take on their backs and

carry into the woods. Then they drive the wedges into a tree, asking it

to permit them to work again after a lapse of four months.

All the young women go to the pit over which the twins were born and

squat over it, leaning on their knuckles, because it is believed that after

doing so they will be sure to bear children.

                    BURIAL.

    When a person is about to die, his friends spit water all over his body.

After death the body is carefully washed, so that every particle of the

bodies of the survivors that might adhere to the corpse may be removed.
Even the places where their breath might have touched the body must be

carefully washed. This is done in order to pi'event that the survivors
might accidentally bewitch themselves (see Sixth Report, p. 610). If the
death occurs during the night, the body is left in the house until day-
light ; if it occurs during the day, it is removed at once. It must not
be taken out of the door, else other inmates of the house would be sure to

die soon. Either a hole is made in one of the walls, through which the

5                   Fig. 1.

body is carried out, or it is lifted through the roof. It is placed behind
the house to be put into the box that is to serve as a coffin. If it were

placed in the coffin inside the house, the souls of the other inmates would
enter the coffin too, and then all would die. The coffin is placed at the
right-hand side of the body. Then a speaker calls the relatives of the
deceased, saying : ' Let the dead one take away all the sickness of his
friends.' Then they all come and sit down at the side of the corpse, wail-

ing for a short time. Now they arise and give the body a kick. They

turn once toward the left, and give the body another kick, repeating this
576  .  REPORT-- 189S.

action four times. This is called ' pushing away the love of the deceased,'
that he may not appear in their dreams, and that his mf^mory may not
trouble them.' Then the wife of the deceased lets the children take off
their shirts and sit down, turning their backs towards the corpse. She
takes his hand and moves it down the backs of the children, then moving
the hand back to the chest of the body. AVith this motion she takes the
sickness out of the bodies of the children and places it into the body of
the deceased, who thus takes it away with him when he is buried.

     After this ceremony an olachen net is placed over the head of the
body, his face is painted red, and the body is wrapped in a blanket. Then

it is tied up, the knees being drawn up to the chin. Now four men of

the clans of which the deceased was not a member lift the body to place
it into the box. Four times they raise it. The fourth time they actually

lift it over the box. Four times they move, but only the fourth time they
actually let it down into the box. If the box should prove too small, they
must not take it out again, but the body is squeezed in as best they can,
even if they should have to break its neck or feet. The head is placed at
the edge where the sides of the box are sewed up (see Fifth Report, p. 817)
because the soul is believed to escape through the joint. The soul leaves
the body on the fourth day after death, escaping through the place where
the frontal fontanel of the child is located. The box is tied up, as indi-

cated in fig. 1. As soon as the four men who carry the coffin to the burial-
garound raise it the women cease to wail, because their tears would

recall the deceased. The relatives are not allowed to attend the funeral,
as it is believed that their souls would stay with that of their dead friend.

Twelve women accompany the coffin. Children are not allowed to go
with it. When the tree on which the body is to be deposited has been
reached, four poor men are sent up to carry a rope by which to haul up

the coffin. When they have reached the branch on which the coffin

is to be placed, they lower the rope. The men who remained below pre-
tend three times to tie the rope to the coffin. The fourth time they really
tie it. Then the men in the tree pull up the rope. Three times they rest

in pulling it up, so that the coffin reaches its linal resting-place after

having been pulled four times. It is placed on the branch and covered

with a large board. Then the men climb down again, cutting off the

branches for some distance under the coffin. When the men come down
from the tree, the women resume their wailing. They scratch their cheeks

with their nails. (The Koskimo use shells for this purpose.) After they
have returned to the village the blankets and mats which the deceased
used are burnt, together with the objects which he used. Food is also
burnt for him. All this is intended for his use, and is burnt because the
dead can use only burnt objects. If he has left a widow, she must use

his blankets, mats, kettle, &c., once before they are burnt. After the death

of a woman the widower must do the same. After four days a person

belonging to another clan cuts the hair of the mourners. The hair is

 burnt. This service is paid for heavily, because it is believed to shorten

the life of the one who has rendered it. The climbers receive a payment
of two blankets each ; those who placed the corpse in the coffin and carried

it to the burial-ground receive one blanket each for their services.

     ' The widow and the children of the deceased wear striacrs made of monntain-
 groat wool and white cedar bark mixed, one around the neck, one ai-ound the waist,
and two connecting ones down the chest ; also strings of the same material around
 wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles.

Chiefs and common people were buried on separate trees. There is

also a separate tree on which twins are buried.

     Nowadays the bodies are mostly buried in small grave-houses. The

custom of raising the coffin three times before it is placed in its final resting-

place is still adhered to.

     The customs of the Koskimo and Tlatlasiqoala differ somewhat fi'om

those of the Kwakiutl. They place the body in the box in the house.
Before doing so the box is turned round four times. Then a hole is cut

into the bottom of the box with an axe, whicli is raised three times before

the hole is really cut. This is the breathing hole of the soul, which does
not die or escape until the fourth day after the death of the body. The

coffin, before it is carried to the burial-ground, is placed on the beach.

The Kwakiutl paint twins, before they are buried, red all over. Four

feathers are attached to the coffin. Nobody is allowed to wail for them.

A surviving twin is washed in the water with which the corpse of the

dead one was washed.

    When a person dies by an accident, and his body is not recovered, a

grave is made for him, which consists simply of painted boards. The say-

ing is that, if this were not done, it would be as though a dog had died.

Nobody is allowed to walk behind such a grave, as by doing so he would

indicate his desire to lie in a grave.

    The widow, particularly if she has many children, must undergo a very
rigorous ceremonial. On the evening of the third day after the death of
her husband, her hair is cut. At the same time a small hut is built for

her. It is made of the mats which were hanging around the bed of the

deceased. The roof is made of the boards which were placed over his bed

in order to keep the soot off". An old woman, preferably one who has

been a widow four times, is appointed to assist her. On the fourth

morning after the death of her husband, she must rise before the crows

cry. She is not allowed to lie down, but must sit all night with her knees

drawn up to her chest. She eats only four bites four times a day, and

drinks only four mouthfuls four times a day. Before taking water or food

she raises it three times. If she thinks that her husband has been

murdered, she takes her food up, saying that it is the neck of her husband's

enemy, and calling his name, she bites it four times. Then she throws it
into the fire, saying : ' This will be your food when you are dead.' That

means that the person whom she named must soon die. When she is

tired she stretches her legs, first the one, then the other, naming her

enemy. This is also believed to bring him death. After four days the

old woman washes her and wipes her with a ring of hemlock branches, as

described above. This is repeated four times in intervals of four days.

After the last washing her old blanket is hung over the stump of a tree,

and her hat, which she wears all the time, is hung on top of the stump.
Then she is given new clothing, and is taken back to the house. There she
must stay in one corner, where she has a small fire of her own. Her

children are not allowed to see her. When she leaves the house, she must

pass out of a small door of her own. Four times she must turn before

putting her foot in the doorway. Four times she must put her foot for-
ward before actually going out, and in the same manner she returns. The

old woman now washes her every sixth day, and rubs her with the ring of

hemlock branches. After the fourth washing she is permitted to come to

the fireplace, but she must avoid going around the fire. Now the old

woman washes her every eighth day, and then four times more every

twelfth day. Thus the whole period extends over one hundred and twenty-

days.

    If the woman is poor, and has many children, four washings in intervals

of ten days are substituted for the washings of the last eighty days, thus
reducing the whole period to eighty days. During all this time she must
not cut her hair. She does not wail during the first sixteen days of the
mourning period while she is confined in the small hut.

                   GAMES.

--1. Eibayu. These dice have the shape indicated in fig. 2. The

casts count according to the narrowness of the sides. This

game is also played by the Tlingit of Alaska.
-- A2. TrE'mkodyu.
                    stick, about three feet long, with a

knob at its end, is thrown against an elastic board, which is

placed upright at some distance. If the stick i-ebounds and

is caught, the player gains four points. If it rebounds to

more than half the distance from the player to the board, he
gains one point. If it falls down nearer the board than one-
half the distance, or when the board is missed, the player does

not gain any point. The two players throw alternately. Each

                    has ten counters. "When one of them gains all the counters,

he is the winner of the stake. When the stick falls down so that the

end opposite the knob rests on the board, the throw counts ten points.

     3. A'laqoa, the well-known game of lehal, or hiding a bone played
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

with twenty counters.

4. T'e'nk'oayu, or carrying a heavy stone on the shoulder to test the

--strength of those who participate in the game.
     5. Mo'k'oa. This game was introduced from the Nootka. It is played

Anbetween tribes.  object is given to a member of one tribe, who hides

it. Then four members of another tribe must guess where it is. They are

allowed to guess four times. If they miss every time, they have lost.

This game is played for very high stakes.

                               VARIOUS BELIEFS ANO CUSTOMS.

     In seal feasts the chest of the seal is given to the liighest chief ; the
feet are given to those next in rank. Tlie young chiefs receive the flippers,

and the tail is given to the chief of the rival clan, who must give a feast
in return. The hunter, before returning home, cuts off" the head of the

seal and gives it to his steersman. He eats the kidney before going home,

and cuts a strip three fingers wide along the back. These customs are said
to have been instituted by O^maqt^d'latle. the ancestor of the clan
Gytfgyilham of the K''o'moyuc.

     The lowest carving on a totem pole is that which the owner inherited
from his father. The higher ones are those which he obtained by

marriage.

     The hunter, before going out to hunt seals or sea-otters, or other sea
animals, rubs his whole canoe with the branches of the white pine, in
order to take away all the bad smell that would frighten away the

animals.

     In order to secure good luck, hunters of sea animals bathe in the sea
before starting. Hunters of land animals bathe in fresh water. Both
rub their bodies with hemlock branches.

     Of the first halibut cauglit in the season the stomach is eaten first,
then the pectoral fins, next the head. The rest is divided. If this were

not done, the halibut would disappear.
     Hunters carve the figure of any remarkable animal that they have

killed on the butts of their guns, or on their bows.

The  souls  of  hunters  are  transformed     into    killer  whales                               those  of
                                                                                                ;

hunters who pursue land animals become wolves. Only when a killer

whale or a wolf dies can their souls return and be born again. Hunters

have the bow seat of their canoes ornamented, and a hole cut in the centre

of the seat. It becomes their dorsal fin when they become killer whales

after their death. It is believed that, after the death of a hunter, the
killer whale into which he has been transformed will come to the village

and show itself. When a great number of killer whales approach a village,

it is believed that they come to fetch a soul.
     Not only hunters are transformed into killer whales. I was told that

at one time a killer whale had been killed, the flipper of which showed a
scar as though it had been burnt. Not long before this event a girl had
died who had at one time burnt her hand. She was identified with the

killer whale.

    When a wolf has been killed, it is placed on a blanket. Its heart is

taken out, and all those who have assisted in killing it must take four

morsels of the heart. Then they wail over the body :

     AlawestEns hegyoso qens nEmoqtseqde      Woei.e.,  ! our great friend.

AThen the body is covered with a blanket and buried.          bow or a gun

with which a wolf has been killed is unlucky, and is given away by the

owner. The killing of a wolf produces scarcity of game.

Wolf's heart and fat are used as medicines for heart diseases (see

Sixth Report, p. 613).

    Women are forbidden to touch a wolf, as else they would lose their

husbands' aflections (see Sixth Report, p. 613).

     The screech owl is believed to be the soul of a deceased person. The

Indians catch them, paint them red, and let them free, asking for long

life.

    The root of the bracken (Pteris aquilina, L.) is believed to know

everything that is going on in the house in which it is being roasted. It

must be treated with great respect. If a person should warm his back

at the fire in which it is being roasted, he will have backache. Parents

of twins, and people who have had sexual intercourse a short time pre-

viously, must not enter a house in which the roots ai'e being roasted.

    When a person dreams that he goes up a mountain and the latter tilts

over, it signifies that he will die soon.

    The gum of the red pine is chewed. That of the white pine is not
used by girls, because it is believed to make them pregnant.

     The world is described as a house. The east is the door of the house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the west is the rear of the house. North is called ' up the river,' south
' down the river.' In the north of the world is the mouth of the earth.
There the dead descend to the country of the ghosts.

     The part of the beach immediately to the west of Fort Rupert, in front
of the place where formerly the village of the sub-tribe Kue'qa stood,
is called the village of the ghosts, who are believed to reside there from

time to time.

580 REPORT-- 189G.

    When there is an eclipse of the sun a man, named Bd'wule, is required

to sing :

Hok'oai', hok'oai', hok'oalai', a'tlas lalaq ts'a'ya laqsgya Bawule'

Vomit it, vomit it, vomit it, else you will be the younger brotlier

    of Bawule'.

    In order to gain the love of a girl the following philter is used : The
tongues and gizzards of a raven and of a woodpecker are placed in a

hollow stick, together with some saliva. They are mixed with the latter ;
the tube is closed and worn under the blanket. The underlying idea was

explained to me thus : The woodpecker and the raven are pretty bii'ds ;
therefore the girl will consider the man who wears them just as pretty and

attractive.

     The tongue of a snake or of a frog is also used as a philter. They are
believed to make the wearer irresistible to everybody.

    Another philter is as follows : The man wears a snake skin on his

body for some time. About the month of August he gathers a root

called tVe'tayas, which resembles in shape two people embracing each

other. He procures four hairs of the girl whom he loves, which, together

with four hairs of his own, he places between the two portions of the root

which resemble the two people. The root is tied up with sinews taken

from a corpse, and wrapped in the snake-skin which the man has been

wearing. For four days after, the man must not look at the girl. Then

she will call him, but he must not follow her. Finally she will come to him.

In order to bewitch a person it is necessary to obtain some of his soiled

clothing, hair, or blood. I described some methods of witchcraft in the

Sixth Report (p. 612). The following method is also used : The clothing
of the enemy is placed in the mouth of a lizard, the head of which has

been cut ofl'. Then a snake's head is pulled over the lizard's head, so that

the latter is in the mouth of the snake. The whole is placed in the
mouth of a frog, which is then sewn up. This bundle is tied as tightly as

possible with the sinews of a corpse, and placed inside a stick which has

been hollowed out, and is then tied up again wilh the sinews of a corpse.

The whole is then covered with gum. This package is placed on the top

of a hemlock -tree which is growing at a windy place. In winter this

method of witchcraft does not do much harm, but as soon as it grows
warm the victim must die.

If a person is believed to be bewitched (e'k-a) his body is rubbed with

white cedar bark, which is then divided into four parts, and buried in

front of four houses, so that the people when entering or leaving the house

must step over it. This will break the spell.

If the children of a couple always die while very young, the little

Afinger of the last child to die is wound with a string.  notch is cut in

the upper rim of the burial box, in which the finger is placed. Then the

cover is put on, and the finger is cut off. It is hidden in the woods that

nobody may find it. The body of the child is placed on a new tree, not

(^n the tree on which other children are put.

               II. The Houses op the Tsimshian and Msk-a'

     The houses of the Tsimshian and of the Nisk-a' are square wooden
structures, like those of the Haida and Kwakiutl, but they differ some-
what in the details of construction. While the house of the Haida (see

--582 REPORT 1896.

Dr. G. M. Dawson, ' Report of Progress, Geol. Surv. of Canada,' 1878-79,
Plates III., IV., and V.), generally has on each side of the central line
three heavy beams which support the roof, the house of the Tsimshian
and of the Kwakiutl has only one pair of heavy beams, one on each side
of the doorway. In the Kwakiutl house these two beams, which rest on
heavy posts, stand no more than 6 feet apart (see ' Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus.,'

1888, p. 210). In the houses of the Tsimshian and Nisk'a' they stand
about halfway between the central line and the lateral walls. This
arrangement necessitates that provision is made for a ridge-beam. The

heavy beams B rest on the uprights U, which are seldom carved. On

top of the beams four supports S are laid, on which rests the ridge-
beam R. The latter consists of two parts, leaving a space in the middle for

Rthe smoke-hole. Sometimes, but not regularly, two additional beams rest

on these supports. In a few cases the central ridge-beam is tlien sup-
ported by a smaller support S'. The lower end of tlie roof is either
arranged as shown in figs. 3 and 4, or as indicated in fig. 5. In the former

                                                                    Fig. 5.

Vcase the roof-supports are separate from the walls ; a beam is laid on

the uprights C, and the roof-boards rest on the beams R, B, and V.

PIn the latter case (fig. 5) the corner-post  is connected with the rear

corner-post by a square beam which supports the lower ends of the

roof- boards. The walls of the old houses consist of horizontal planks of

great width. The thick planks of the front, rear, and sides (figs. 4, 5)
are grooved, and the thinner planks are let into these grooves. The two

mouldings of the front are also thick planks, which are grooved. Over
Dthe door
           is a short, heavy plank, on which rests a single thinner

vertical plank. The construction of the back may be seen in fig. 3.

Sometimes the houses are built on steep banks, so that only the rear

half is built on the ground. In this case a foundation of heavy
Acedar- trees is built.
                         short log is placed with its end into the bank, the

butt end standing out towards the beach, where the side wall is to be.

Another log is placed in the same manner where the second side wall is

Ato be.  third heavy log is placed over the butts of the two projecting

logs. Then two more logs are put on top of the preceding one with their

ends into the bank, and thus a foundation is built up to the level of ttie

embankment. This is covered with a platform, and the house is built

about eight or ten feet back from its outer edge, so that the platform

forms the front portion of the floor of the house, and also a walk leading

to the house-door.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             i

III. The Growth of Indian Children from the Interior op I

                          British Columbia.          '

     The table below shows the results of a compilation of the rates

--of growth of Indian children of the following tribes : Ntlakya'pamu^,

Shuswap, Okanagan, Kalispelm, Yakima, Warm Springs. I have com-

bined all these tribes, because the adults have very nearly the same

stature, and because the geographical environment is very much alikt.

The numbers of individuals are rather small, but nevertheless a feiv

results of general interest may be deduced from it.  ;

It will be noticed that in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth yeai's

girls are taller than boys. This agrees closely with the period during

which the same phenomenon takes place among the whites, and is later

than among the Indians of southern latitudes. The decrease in variability

is not very well marked, probably because there is a considerable uncer-

tainty in regard to the estimated ages of the children. Still, it appears

that there is a distinct drop in the fifteenth year in boys, and in the

thirteenth year in girls. Among the Mission Indians of Southern Cali-

fornia this drop takes place between the thirteenth and fourteenth years

in boys, between the ninth and eleventh years in girls. Among the white

children of Massachusetts the drop takes place between the fifteenth and

sixteenth years in boys, between the fourteenth and fifteenth years in

girls i.e., nearly at the same time as, or a little later than, among the

Indians of British Columbia.

    As my treatment of the Nisk-a language in the Tenth Report of the Committee

was verj- brief, I give here some additional information in regard to it.
     In the Fifth Report (p. 878; I have treated the formation of the plural in the

Tsimshian, and Count von der Sehulenburg has treated the same subject on pp. 9 ff. of
his work (' Die Sprache der Zimsblan-Indianer.' Braunschweig, isoi). The principles
underlying the formation of the plural will become clearer b)- the following remarks
on the formation of the plural in the Niska dialect :

          ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                           587

          id'hjf, to tlr.inder.               Jtasa't, to want.
          saaniDvo'k-, to rebuke.             tlmd'Em, to help.

          dB'lBmEq/i\ to reply.               gyi'dEq, to ask.
          mc'lEli', to dtinin.                hola'n, to leave something.
          iS'miii, to sing.                   J«7^' to feel.
          ffi/v, to see.

     2. The plural is formed by reduplication, the beginning of the word, as far as the
first consonant following the first vowel, being repeated with weakened vowel. The
accent of the word is not changed. The reduplicated syllable remains separated
from the reduplicated word by a hiatus.

     This is particularly evident in words beginning with a vowel. In these there is a
distinct pause between the terminal consonant of the reduplication and the initial
vowel of the reduplicated word :

          OH plural iu'u'n, to throw.         a'lgyiq  plural ETa'lgyiq, to speak.

          dm ,, j'.m'd'm, good.

    It seems to me that this method of forming the plural may be considered dupli-

cation affected by certain laws of euphony. Monosyllabic words beginning and
terminating either with a vowel or with a single consonant, according to the rule
given above, are duplicated. Monosyllabic words terminating with a combination

of consonants drop all the elements of the terminal cluster of consonants, except
the first one, because else there would be a great accumulation of consonants in the
middle of the word. The same causes that bring about the elision of the terminal

cluster of consonants probably affect polysyllabic words in such a manner that the
whole end of the word was dropped. This seems the more likely, as the repeated
syllable has its vowel weakened. If a polysyllabic word was thus repeated the effect
must have been very similar to the repetition of a word with a terminal cluster of
consonants. For instance, w^w^'h, to know, duplicated with weakened vowels, would
form indmvuld' H . In this word, according to the rule governing the reduplication
of monosyllabic words with a terminal cluster of consonants, the first w would drop

out, so that the form wuhvulu'H would originate.

    A few euphonic changes of consonants take place :

     hy, gy, and It, following the first vowel of the word, are aspirated in the redupli-
cation, and form w.

   y and k- are also aspirated, and form q.

    y becomes the surd aspirate //.
     ts becomes s.

     The weakened vowels have a tendency to change into e or i. The variability and
indistinctness of the vowels make it difficult to establish a general rule.

     I classify the examples in order to bring out the points referred to above.

     7(. Words beginning with combinations of consonants do not always reduplicate
in the manner described above, as it sometimes results in an accumulation of con-

sonants in the middle of the word. If such inadmissible clusters should result, only
the first consonant of the word is repeated. In such cases initial q is transformed
into k\

    i. Words beginning with Aw have in the plural Iivw. When km is considered as
one syllable, the semi-vowel m standing for a weak ii and tv, the reduplicated form
would be hwhn\ which, when pronounced rapidly and with the following vowel, must

naturally become hiiw. I believe, therefore, that this plural must be included in the

reduplications :

hma         plural huwa', name.                   h/vtl       plural hilwi'l, to do.

                                                Composition.

    The composition of words in Tsimshian and Nisk-a is remarkably loose. Although
there are a great number of formative elements which have no independent existence
they do not combine very intimately with the words to which they are prefixed. I
pointed out before that the reduplicated syllable remains separated from the stem
by a hiatus or pause. The same is true of all compositions, as the following examples

will show :

                                         hagun^ie'E, to walk towards.

                                                ts'EDi'a'kys, in water.

                                           Isg-Ern'oH, to throw into (from top).

    This loose connection is also shown by the fact that in compounds the plural is
formed from the stem alone.

kidts'a'p        plural       kaltsEts'a'p, town.   mU'bEnsk plural nsEpse'VEnsk, friend.
knlkni'lp                     kalhuivd'lp, house

    There are very few cases of contractions.                                                                                                                      The end of Ihis word was

Appendix. Tn-elee tables, sliorcing for each divhion of schools the number of
      cldldren seen, the number presenting one or more class of defect. The classes
       of defect are distributed first under school standards, secondly in age groups 595

The Committee, acting in conjunction with a committee appointed for
the same purpose by the International Congress of Hygiene and Demo-
graphy, and the British Medical Association, is now able to give a

further account of the 50,000 children examined individually, 1892-94,
in sixty-three schools, together with some information bearing on the

causation of defects in childhood.

     The methods of examination and the points observed were described
in our first report. The total number of boys and girls, with each class of
defect, was given in 1894. In our last report the number of boys and
girls, with the individual defects, was given as distributed in twelve
divisions of schools, representing Board schools, Voluntary schools, the

nationalities and social classes ; also the primary classes of defect in pro-
portions on the number of children seen and the number noted.

     In each of the following tables the heading shows the division of
schools dealt with. The cases are arranged first in school standards,

secondly in age groups. Standard contains children too old for the

infant school and too dull or backward for Standard I. In Table VII. the

column headed 'No standard' contains the boys in a high-class school

--which was not arranged in standards. The average ages as recognised for
pupils in the standards i-espectively are :  Infants, five years and under
                                                                                                                                                   ;

Standard I., six years, rising a standard a year, so that at twelve years of

age the child may reach Standard VII.

The primary main classes of defect are indicated in the tables by

symbols :

     A. Defect in develojmient only : not in combination with other class of

defect.

     B. Abiiornud nerve-signs only ; not in combination with other class of

defect.
      C. Pale, thin, or delicate only.

     D. Reported as mentally dull or hackivard only.

     Six other primary groups are arranged by taking cases with two main

classes of defect only.

     Four primary groups present three main classes of defect only.
     One primary group presents the four main classes of defect combined

-- --in each case.

    The remainder groups E, F, and G contain the cases with defects

not classed above as main classes ; such as eye cases, children maimed or

crippled, <fec.

   We thus show for each division of schools the children who presented

an observed defect in development of body, in nerve status, in physical
health and nutrition, and those reported by the teachers as dull or back-

ward, arranged in primary groups presenting only the class of defect indi-

cated by the formula. To obtain the total number of cases with any class
of defect, whether comljined with other class of defect or not, the numbers

representing all the primary groups containing such defect must be added

together. The total or compound group AB=primary AB + ABC + ABD

+ABCD. It is also possible, for the purposes of research, to arrange

from the tables the children in whom any class of defect is absent, and
thus compare their conditions in contrast with the children in whom sucli

defects were present. Such actuarial work is useful in seeking tlie
causation of defects. Examples liave been worked out by Dr. Francis
Warner.

     This arrangement of our cases has afforded much information for the
solution of certain problems, and the means of answering many questions
concerning conditions of childhood. It has become possible to compare
similar groups of children under varied environment and at different ages.

     Comparison of the cases presenting some defect, as to their ages in
relation to the standard in which they were placed, shows that 25'6 per
cent, of the boys and 26 '3 per cent, of the girls were over the average age
recognised for the standard. Thus evidence is obtained of a lower mental

status in children with the signs of defect, apart from the report of the

teachers, while the value of the signs observed is indicated. Facts such
as these can be arranged for any division of schools.

It is well known that developmental and congenital defect forms an

appreciable cause in the high rate of infant mortality, esjaecially among

males                        many                    children,  however,  with the lesser degrees of   defect,    survive
                         ;

to school age, and form 88 per cent, of the boys and 6'8 per cent, of the

girls seen in schools. It was shown in our report of 1894 that conditions

of defect are frequently associated in children ; the tables now puljlished
make it possible to show that such conditions vary in boys and in girls

respectively in the age groups.

Among the children with developmental de/ects, those who are seven

years old and under have the lowest percentage association with additional

or acquired defects. This is more marked among boys than girls. They

have, however, a tendency to acquire nerve-disturbance, delicacy, and

mental dulness under the continued action of their environment, as they

grow older                                           this  is   specially marked with the girls.       When eight to ten
                                                  ;

years of age the proportion of those children who have acquired additional

defects has risen 7 per cent. ; while at twelve years and older only 37 per

cent, of the boys and 25 per cent, of the girls with developmental defects

are free from additional or acquired delicacy, nerve-disturbance, or mental

dulness. Further, among developmental defect cases, the signs of nerve-

disturbance are more associated with other defect in boys under eleven

years                        while                   at    all  ages the  association with  low   nutrition  and  mental
                          ;

dulness is greater in girls. At eleven years of age and over, develop-

mental defect is most associated with nerve- disturbance, delicacy, and

dulness in the girls.

The calculations upon Avhich these statements are made, as founded

upon the tables here given, will be found in the 'Statistical Journal,'
March 1896.

     Brain-disorderliness, as indicated by abnormal nerve-signs, is a more
potent cause of mental dulness than congenital defect of development of

the body. Nerve-signs, whether they occur alone or in combination with
defect in development or not, are more directly connected with low mental
ability than congenital defect of the body. This is most marked in
children seven years and under, particularly with girls ; in the age-group
eight to ten it is most marked with boys ; while at eleven years and over
it is about equal in the sexes. It should thus be an object, in training
children, to prevent them from acquiring any abnormal nerve-signs.

     In the London Board schools efficient physical training was given (these
children are presented in Tables I. to IV.) , in the Scotch Board school
(see Table VI.) no physical training was given. The physical condition

--of the Scotch children was better developmental cases, boys 8 per cent.,

girls 4-6 per cent. ; and delicate children, boys 2*2 per cent., girls 3-3 per

--cent., as against, in the London schools developmental cases, boys 8*5 per

cent., girls 6-8 per cent. ; and delicate children, boys 2-8 per cent., girls

3*4 per cent. When, however, we come to look to their brain status, we

find, in the Scotch school, 13-6 per cent, boys and 10*3 per cent, girls
with abnormal nerve-signs, while 9-8 per cent, boys and 6-2 per cent, girls
are dull or backward pupils; as against, in the London schools, 9-7 per
cent, boys, and 8"2 per cent, girls with nerve-signs, and 7*9 percent, boys,
and 7*1 per cent, girls reported as dull pupils. Further analysis of the
cases shows the nerve-signs as probably connected with the larger propor-
tion of dull pupils. The inference is that good physical training lessens
the proportion of children with inco-ordinated brain action, and coinci-

dently the proportion of dull pupils.

     Many other points of interest might be dealt with on the basis of the
facts arranged in the tables, and answers can be given therefrom to many

questions raised from time to time. In the last two reports we have dealt
mostly with the main classes of defects ; in searching for the means of
removing or preventing them it will be necessaiy to make further analysis
and classification of the individual defects, especially as to the nerve-
signs. Cases presenting each nerve-sign should be classified, as the main
class of nerve-cases has been classified ; we should thus obtain information
as to the lines of causation of each, and their relative significance. As all
our cases are recorded on separate cards, this can readily be done, but the
work would involve much clerical labour.

      The Committee desire to be reappointed, and ask a grant in aid of this

work.

                                            Description of Tables.

      Each table is arranged for a division of schools as given in the heading.
 Cases are distributed into primary groups presenting only the class of
 defect indicated by the symbols. The numbers on the left hand refer to
 definition of the class, as given in the full report published.' In the first

 half of the table the groups are distributed according to educational

 standards. The numbers seen and the numbers noted are given at the
 bottom of this section of the table.

       In the second half of the table the groups are distributed according

 to ages.

1. As in previous years, the Committee have had the advantage of the
co-operation of several gentlemen not members of the Association, but
delegates of various learned bodies who are interested in the Survey.

Mr. George Payne, one of the delegates of the Society of Antiquaries,

and Mr. E. Clodd, Mr. G. L. Gomme, and Mi'. J. Jacobs, the repre-
sentatives of the Folklore Society, Sir C. M. Kennedy, K.C.M.G.,
representing the Royal Statistical Society, Mr. Edward Laws, the Ven.

Archdeacon Thomas, Mr. S. W. Williams, and Professor John Rhys,

representing the Cambrian Archaeological Association, and Dr. C. R.
Browne, a representative of the Royal Irish Academy, have continued
their valuable services. Other members of the Committee are delegated

by the Anthropological Institute.
      2. In previous reports, the Committee presented a list of villages or

places which, in the opinion of competent persons consulted by the Com-
 mittee, appeared especially to deserve ethnographic study. They also
 recorded the commencement of such study in several parts of the United
 Kingdom by observers residing in the respective neighbourhoods. Since
 the last meeting of the Association the Committee have taken an impor-
 tant step in advance by commissioning the Rev. Dr. Walter Gregor to
 make a special visit to the district of Galloway for the purpose of the

survey. He remained there during part of the months of October and

 November 1895, and paid another visit in the spring of the present year.

 On these occasions he collected a considerable amount of information on

 the current traditions and folklore of the district, and took measurements
 of a number of the inhabitants. The Committee have requested him to
 complete his observations on the people of Galloway, and to commence a
 similar systematic survey of Ayrshire, the results of which will, it is

 expected, be ready for insertion in their next Report. Dr. Gregor pos-
 sesses special qualifications for this work, and his preliminary notes ai-e
 appended to this Report, not merely as being of interest in themselves, but
 as indicating by example the manner of recording folklore.

       3. The tabulation of the results of Dr. Gregor's physical measure-
  ments, and of those which the Committee have received from other sources.
         --

--608 REPORT 1896.

is deferred to a future Report. The Committee hope also, if reappointed,

in future Reports to supply bibliographical information.
     4. The Committee have provided, for the use of observers of the

physical characters of the people, a number of the following instruments

graduated in millimetres :

                      A1. two-metre tape.
                      A2. pair of folding callipers.
                      A3. folding square.
                       A4. small set-square.

Sets of these have been supplied to applicants in various parts of the

country, who will communicate to the Committee the measurements they
take. Others are still available for use by competent observers who may

desire to borrow them, and those at present in circulation will be reissued
as soon as returned. Several applications were made in consequence of
an announcement on the matter inserted in the ' Academy,' ' Athenaeum,'

and ' Nature ' by the courtesy of the editors of those journals.
     5. The Committee have to thank the Rev. Fletcher Moss, of Didsbui-y,

for a number of measurements and other observations.
     6. The Committee are much indebted to Mr. G. Paul for undertaking

to organise, through communications to the local papers circulating in
Nidderdale, and communications with the local Naturalists' Club, a survey
of that district, the results of which the Committee hope to receive in due

course.

7. Tlie Buchan Field Club has published a series of observations made

by Mr. John Gray, B.Sc, and Mr. Tocher, secretary of the club, upon

the anthropological characters of the people of East Aberdeenshire. It is

proceeding with the work upon the lines laid down by this Committee.

8. The Irish Ethnographic Committee, consisting of Professors Cun-

ningham and Haddon, members of this Committee, and Professors Haugh-

ton and Wright, is engaged in tabulating the results of the measurements

of over 500 individuals taken during the last four years in the Anthro-

pometric Laboratory of Trinity College, Dublin. It is intended to

tabulate the statistics with reference to ethnography, to the occupation

of the subjects, and to the success of the students. For the first of these

the subjects will be grouped geographically, according to the districts

from which their parents come, in probably a dozen groups. Dr. C. R.

Browne, who co-operates with this Committee, has undertaken the work
Aof tabulating the observations and calculating the indices.
                                                              Report

from the Committee is appended.

9. The Cambridge Ethnographic Survey Committee have also com-

menced operations. They are at present investigating the villages of

Barrington and Foxton, but as yet there are no i-esults available for this

Report.

     10. The Committee have to thank the Congress of Archaeological
Societies in union with the Society of Antiquaries of London for printing
and circulating among their members a large number of this Committee's
code of instructions, with Mr. Hartland's explanatory paper appended
thereto. At the Canterbury Meeting of the Royal Archa?ological Insti-
tute a discussion has taken place on the subject of an ethnographical

survey of Kent.

     IL Appended to this Report is an important communication made to
this Committee by Mr. Laurence Gomme, on the method of determining
     ox THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 609

the value of folklore as ethnological data. The recommendations of Mr.

Gomme will be found to be valuable when the stage arrives at which it is

practicable and necessary to compare the collections made by the Com-

mittee in different localities.

     12. The Committee have learned with much gratification from Mr.
Oriffith that the establishment of similar committees for the Dominion of
Canada and the United States of America, working on the same lines as

this Committee, is in contemplation.
     13. The Committee look upon these several results of their work as

encouraging, and ask to be reappointed for the purpose of continuing it.
They also ask for a further grant of 50/., having wholly expended the

sum granted for the present year.

                              APPENDIX I.

--The Ethnographical Survey of Ireland. Report of the Committee, con-

     sisting of Dr. C. R. Browne, Professor D. J. Cunningham, Dr. S.
    Haughton, Professor E. Perceval Wright, and Professor A. C.

    Haddon [Secretary). [Drawn up by the Secretary.)

Last year the Royal Irish Academy published ' a Report by Dr. C. R.

Browne on ' The Ethnography of the Mullet, Inishkea Islands, and

Portacloy, co. Mayo,' illustrated by three plates of photographs. This is

the third Report issued by the Dublin Ethnographic Committee, and the

--investigation was carried out on the same lines as previously that is, it

embraces the physiography of the district, anthropography (physical

--chai'acters and statistics, vital statistics personal and economic, phy-

siology, folk-names) ; sociology (occupations, customs, food, clothing,

dwellings, and transport) ; folklore, archaeology (survivals and antiqui-

ties) ; history, &c. The district investigated is a very wild and remote

part of Ireland, and, in spite of great difficulties. Dr. Browne has

Aproduced a valuable and interesting memoir.                        full series of observa-

tions were taken on sixty-two adult males, and the eye and hair colours

of 494 individuals were recorded. The average stature of the men is

1"725 m. (about 5 ft. 8 in.) ; they are stoutly built and broad-shouldered.
Over 80 per cent, of the adults have brown or dark hair, and about the

same number have light eyes ; but the eyes of the women run darker
than those of the men. The cephalic index of the men is mainly (39)

mesaticephalic, there being 20 brachycephals and only 3 dolichocephals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

if two units are deducted (as is often done to compare with cranial

indices), the numbers are 41 mesati-, 10 brachy-, and 11 dolicho-cephals.

The mean cephalic index is 79'4, the facial is 111 '9, and the nasal 64.
Dr. Browne analyses the differences of the people from the various

districts. Thus the North Inishkea and the Portacloy are the tallest

(av. 1'727 m.^.5 ft. 8 in.) ; but the former have the shortest arms, the

proportion of span to height  being  102-45                         while  at Portacloy it  is
                                                                 ;

105-65, and intermediate elsewhere. The nigrescence index is as follows :

Inishkea Islands 10-5, Mullet 62-3, Portacloy 77-5 ; thus the islands show
argreater proportion of light hair. There is a greater tendency to brachy-

cephalism in South Inishkea and Portacloy, and none of these men were

district, being cut off by a semicircle of mountains fi-om the rest of the

county. The people, who are much intermarried, are largely descended

Afrom Ulster settlers.  statement, originally made by an anonymous

writer, has somehow gained currency, and has been repeatedly quoted
abroad, noticeably by M. de Quatrefages and by M. Devay, that the

descendants of the Ulster people, driven two centuries ago into Sligo and

Mayo, had dwindled into dwarfs of 5 feet 2 inches high, prognathous,
and pot-bellied. Dr. Browne found that the average height of these

people is 1'721 m. (5 feet 7| inches), and they exhibited no sign of physical

degeneracy ; they are very healthy, fond of music and dancing, given to
joking, and sharp in business. Though there is a coast-line of forty-

seven miles, nearly all the men are farmers. The houses are of a some-
what better order than those commonly found in the West of Ireland.
Fifty men were measured, and the hair and eye colours of 298 individuals
noted. The mean cephalic index is 80-5 (78-.5), facial index 112-6, and

nasal index 63-9. Full details, as in the last Report, will shortly be

published in the ' Proceedings' of -the Royal Irish Academy.

                              APPENDIX II.

               Report of the EthnograjMcal Survey of Pembrokeshire.

                           By Edward Laws, Esq., F.S.A.

    At the annual meeting of the Cambrian Archseological Association,
held at Launceston in August 189.5, Mr. Henry Owen, F.S.A., and myself

were requested to institute an archteological survey of the county of
Pembroke.

    Mr. Owen undertook to compile a bibliography --no slight task, for

though Pembroke is comparatively a small county it has perhaps been

more freely ink -bespattered than any shire in Wales. Mr. Owen has now

ready for press an annotated catalogue of printed books referring to the
county. This list he will present to the committee appointed by the
Cambrian Archffiological Association at their meeting on the 7th Septem-

ber in Aberystwith. When the catalogue of printed books has been issued

it is proposed to prepare and print a list of MSS. relating to the county
of Pembroke. This is a work that cries aloud for the worker. The list of
MSS. relating to the Welsh counties preserved in the British Museum was
compiled just one hundred years ago, and other great libraries are equally

behind the times.

     I myself undertook to raise a company of Pembrokeshire men, and

with their assistance archaeologically annotate the 6 -inch ordnance survey

of the county of Pembroke. I have now ready for press thirty quarter
sheets, and hope before the end of the month of August to receive twenty

more.

     The system we have adopted is as follows : I send out one or more
quarter sheets to a volunteer worker, requesting that he will mark thereon

with a pinhole the position of the following objects :

    Camps or spaces enclosed by earthworks.
    Camps or .spaces enclosed by stone wall.
                      -- --X

ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 61

     Camps or spaces enclosed by banks or walls at right angles.

     Earthworks which do not enclose a space.
     Settlements as shown by hut foundations, animal bones, sheila, &c.
      Interments, barrows, graves.
      Megalithic remains, cromlechs, rocking stones, menhirs, holed stones,

stone circles.

    Inscribed stones, with Ogam or Roman lettering, or carved.

     Stone implements, or flint chips.
     Bronze implements.

      Pottery.

      Coins.
      Ecclesiastical buildings, or remains.
      Military buildmgs, or remains.

     Domestic buildings, manor houses, &c., or remains.

       Battle-fields.

     Holy wells.
     Localities connected with legends.
      Other spots of archaeological interest.

    Having marked these spots on the map with a pinhole, the assistant
is requested to put a number on the back of the map by his pinhole, and

a symbol on the face (for this purpose he has been supplied with a
simple code of symbols, which seems to answer fairly well), and then on a
separate piece of paper to writ#his remarks, measurements, &c.

    On receipt of the quarter sheet with the accompanying notes, I

schedule the latter thus :

        Symbol No. Locality Object Notes and References.
                  ||            ||

     I look up former descriptions of the object already published and give

them in the fifth column. If the object is technical, such as an Ogam or
inscribed stone, I ask aid from an expert ; if something that seems to me

important or incomprehensible, I personally inspect.
     Of the thirty quarter sheets received two have proved barren ; on the

remaining twenty-eight I find 24.6 objects marked, and of these 106 have

escaped the Ordnance Surveyor.

The gentlemen to whom I am indebted for this valuable assistance are

six in  number :  Lieut. Howorth, R.A. ;  Lieut.-Col. Lambton                                                                                  A. H.
                                                                                                                                            ;

Lascelles, Esq. ; Henry Mathias, Esq. ; Thos.  Wall,  Esq.,  M.D.                                                                              Mr.
                                                                                  ;

Henry Williams, editor of the ' Pembroke County Guardian.'

These gentlemen still hold some sheets, and a good many more have

been distributed among other friends, which I hope shortly to receive.

    When finished each quarter sheet will be complete in itself, and, if my

Committee think good, can be supplied to members and non-members of

the Association at a cost very little exceeding the original price of the

map.
     Our associate, Mr. Williams, has been good enough to give up to the

survey a column of newspaper in which to collect notices of the customs,

traditions, and superstitions of the people. As the ' Pembroke County

Guardian' is published at Solva, in the Welsh-speaking districtof Pembroke-

shire, this is a very valuable aid, for although the English-speaking portion

of the county has been well exploited, the Welshery is still untrodden

when properly digested, we hope to reprint at the end of the year. Two
notes I will give as specimens :^

    Y1. The Vicar of Pontfaen draws attention to a custom called ' Wyl-

nos,' or the Wake Night.

     Formerly, the day before burial, the corpse was removed from the
coffin, a rope passed under the arms, by which it was drawn up the chim-
ney of the house, then lowered again and replaced in the coffin. Tliis

ghastly ceremony was common in the last century : the last recorded per-

formance took place at the Old Mill on the glebe land of Pontfaen.
      Several persons have corroborated the vicar's story as to this unnatural

performance.

     2. The hell-hounds, whist-hounds, or dandy-dogs, as they are called in
diflferent places, are still occasionally heard on the slopes of Precelli, but

here they are termed ' Own bendith y Mamau.'

                              APPENDIX III.

               Preliminary Report on Folklore in Galloway, Scotland.

                         By Rev. Walter Gkegor, LL.D.

     On October 16, 1895, I went, on the invitation of Sir Herbert Max-
well, to the Airlour, parish of Mochrum, Wigtownshire. He afforded me,

 durinf' the time I was his guest, every facility to carry out the work
 entrusted to me. From one of his workmen, John Thomson, aged seventy
 years, I obtained the Folk-tale of ' Marget Totts ' and the tale of Aiken-
 drum the Brownie, along with a good many items of folklore, including

 the mode of cutting 'The Have.' On Monday the 21st, on the invitation

 of Mr. Wright of Alticry, I went to Alticry House, and took measure-
 ments of three men, two farmers and Mr. Wright's gamekeeper, from the

 last of whom I got some rhymes and other items of folklore. In the
 parish of Mochrum seven sets of measurements were got, and one was

 obtained in the neighbouring parish of Glasserton. The best thanks of
 the Committee are due to Sir Herbert and Lady Maxwell, as well as to
 the Misses Maxwell for their helpful kindness. Mr. Wright showed

 great attention. On Tuesday, October 22, I went to Soulseat, the Manse
 of Inch, the residence of the Rev. Mr. Paton. He used every exertion
 to help me to carry out the wishes of the Committee. He took me to

  those of his parishioners whose ancestors had been for the longest period

 in Galloway. From this parish, Stranraer and Stoneykirk, were obtained
  eleven sets of measurements, nine males and two females. The difficulty
  met with in those parishes is the mixture of modern Ii-ish. With the

  help of Mr. and Mrs. Paton those whose ancestors were Irish either on
  the father's or mother's side were avoided as much as possible in the parish
  of Inch, though it was not always convenient to do so. From Inch were
  obtained several rhymes and other items of folklore. I have to say that
  Mr. and Mrs. Paton were most kind, and without Mr. Paton's help not

  much could have been accomplished. On October 29 I went to the Manse

  of Minnigaff, and was most cordially received by Mr. and Mrs. Reid.

  Mr. Reid spared no pains to meet my wishes, both by driving me for
  miles through the wild Galloway moors and by taking me to those he
  considered able to help me both in Minnigaff and in Newton-Stewart.
     ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 613

Eleven measurements of males and ten of females were obtained, along

with some folklore.
    Some items of folklore have not been communicated to the Com-

mittee, as I wish to make further investigation into them. It will be

--seen that twenty-eight measurements of males and twehe of females in
--all forty have been obtained, along with a considerable amount of folk-

lore. The items of folklore which follow are numbered for facility of
reference, and the place where each was obtained is indicated at the

commencement of the paragraph.
     I have only to add that nothing could exceed the kindness and

courtesy with which I was received by all, and the readiness with which
all eave themselves to be measured, and that all were much interested in

the survey.

     1. Mochrum. ' Marget Totts.'-- Once on a time a man was very hard

towards his wife, and laid tasks on her no one could accomplish. He

at one time gave her such a quantity of flax to spin within a tixed time

that the work was beyond human power. As she was sitting in the
house bemoaning herself, and thinking of what was to be done, a woman
entered. Seeing her in great distress and perplexity, she asked her what

was the matter with her. She told her of the task that had been laid
on her by her husband. The stranger said to her : ' I'll tack awa' yir
lint an spin't t' you, an bring't back t' you on such and such a day

(naming the day), if ye can tell me my name.' The guidwife agreed at
once, and gave the woman the lint. But she was now in as great straits

as ever, and could in no way come to her apparent friend's name, and the
day on which the lint was to be brought back was drawing near. As she

was one day sitting at her wits' end in the house a man came in. He

asked her what ailed her that she was looking so cast down and sad. She

told him all her tale. Now near the house there was a small hill covered
with thorn bushes and whins. The man told her to go to this hill and

hide herself among the bushes near an open space on it, and she would
hear something to help her. She did as she was told. She had not
been long in her hiding-place till a lot of fairy women came with their
spinning wheels and sat down on the open space not far from her. She
saw her friend amongst them. As she span she went on saying, ' Little

does the guidwife ken it my name's Marget Totts.' The woman with-

drew without being seen by the fairies. The day fixed for bringing

back the yarn came, and the woman appeared with it. ' Here's yir yarn,
if ye can tell me what my name is.' ' Your name's Marget Totts,' said

the guidwife. The spinner went up the lum in a blaze of fire, and left

the yarn.

   --2. Mochrum, The Brownie is believed to be, for the most part, of a

 kind, obliging disposition.

   A Brownie that bore the name of Aikendrum went one day to the

mill of Birhosh and ofiered his services to the guidwife on the sole con-

dition of getting a 'cogful o' brose each evening atween the licht an the

dark ' as his wages. He took in hand for this wages to bring all the grain

into the .stackyard and to thresh it, and to gather the sheep into the ' rees.'

The guidwife was quite keen for keeping him, but the daughters objected
as no wooers would come to the house so long as Aikendrum was in it.
The mother ordered silence, and took the Brownie into service. The
harvest was late, and he began his work at once. Within a short time

 all the grain was safe in the stackyard. One evening he was ordered to

goather in all the sheep. By morning, when the family was astir, the

sheep were all in the 'rees.' 'It must have been a hard job for you,

said the guidwife, on seeing what had been done. ' I had mair trouble,'

said the Brownie, ' wi a little broon ane Avi' waggin' horns nor a' the laive

Athegither.' The little ' broon ane wi' waggin horns ' was a hare.

married daughter came to live at the mill. One day she gave him a

pair of her husband's breeks. He was so offended that he left at once.

Before going away he took out the two millstones and threw them into

--the weal below the bridge over the Bladnach. He would liave nothing

more than his fixed wages 'the cogful of brose.'

  --3. Mochrum. The following story was told to my informant when a

boy by an old woman eighty years of age. It was on the Sacrament

Sunday, ' the langest day in June.' She was a girl at the time, and was

left to look after the house in the absence of the other members of the

family at church. She went outside and sat down on a stone 't' read her
beuk.' While sitting and reading she saw ' the bonniest wee man she

ever saw in her life come oot amon' the thorn busses, go to the kiln

kno\i^e, and sit doon on the loupin-on-stane, and for twa oors he played
on the bagpipes " The Birks o' Aberfoyle," the bonniest music she ever

heard in her life.' The bonnie wee man was dressed in green, braided

with yellow, and had a four-cornered hat.

  --4. Mochrum. About forty-eight years ago, as some men were approach-

ing the bridge over the Airlour Burn, a big black dog with fire flying out

of his mouth was seen crossing the road into a wood on the opposite side

of the road. Before any of them could come up to him, he had entered

the wood and disappeared.

   --5. Mochrum. It is considered to be unlucky to cart away ' standing

stones,' i.e. the stones of the circles called Druidical.

  --6. Mochrum. It is unlucky to cart away any of the soil from a grave-

yard, however long it has ceased to be used. There is a farm called

Kirkland in the parish of Mochrum. On it is a spot said to have been

used as a burial-ground long ago. It remained untouched till about

sixty years ago. At that time the tenant set about carting away the soil.

Hardly had he begun work when two of the horses fell dead.

  --7. Mochrum. To forget the Sabbath-day and to begin to work as on

week-days was very unlucky. The farmer of D                                                                       once forgot that it

Awas the Sabbath, and yoked the plough as usual.                                                                  man going to church

saw him ploughing                                                                          he  ran  to  him  and  told him what day it was.  The

farmer said he had forgotten. Within a year the farmer, his wife, and

--the farm had all gone to ruin.
     8. Mochrum. If one was leaving a house with a grudge and did not

wish the incoming tenant to thrive, the following ceremony was gone

through. After all the furniture was taken out, the house was swept

clean and all the ashes were removed from the hearth, which was also

swept quite clean. Stones were then placed upright on the hearth, in the

same way as peats are placed to make a fire. Those that entered the

house would be as bare as the house, and there would be no luck to the

Myindwellers till that fire (of stone) would burn.                                                                informant has seen

such.

   --9. Mochrum. On taking up one's abode in a house from which others

had removed, in case ' ill had been left on the house,' a hen, a cat, a dog,

or other living creature was thrown into it.

informant once went through this incantation, but when she came to the
last bit she turned and fled in fright lest ' Uncle Geordie ' should make

   --18. Mochrum. If an unmarried woman takes one of her shirts and goes

to a stream, well, or loch where three lairds' lands meet, washes it in the
water, returns home, hangs it in front of the fire, goes to bed, and lies

awake, she will see her future husband come and turn the article of

dress.

will made a present of a sovereign to the couple.

years ago) the chief day for celebrating marriages. Few marriages took

place on Friday. Now Friday is the chief day.

and ' fired ' in front of the fire. At the evening meal a dish of ' brose,'

called the ' melder brose,' was served to the whole household, and then a

Apiece of the bannock was given to each member of the family.                      small

give a portion of unthreshed oats to each of the horses and the cattle of

the farm.

   --121. Mochrum. One must have on some piece of new dress on New

Year's Day.

   --122. Minnigaff. As the clock strikes twelve at night on Hogmanay

a large Isonfire is kindled on the Green of the village of Minnigaff. For
some weeks before the boys are busy collecting brushwood and pieces of

fallen trees from the neighbouring woods. The Earl of Galloway, to

whom the woods belong, gives all facilities for this purpose. By the last
day of the year a goodly quantity of material has been gathered. On that

day everyone is busy in erecting the pile to be burned, and before the
appointed hour everything is ready. There is no ceremony before or at
the kindling, and there is no special person set apart to apply the fire. The
pile burns through the night and commonly through part of next day.
It is always erected on the same spot. About seventy years ago the
bonfire was composed of different material. For months before the bones
all round the district were collected and stored in a little hut built by the

boys with rough stones in a corner of the village green. The bones of
622 EEPORT-- 1896.

any animal that had died and been buried for a considerable time were

dug up and stored. For about a fortnight previous to Hogmanay the

boys went the round of the village and laid all the peat-stacks under

tribute. The peats were all carefully stowed away till required. On the

last day of the year the peats were first piled up, and then the pile was
covered with the bones. At twelve o'clock at night the whole was set on

fire, and the younger part of those present ran round the blazing pile, but

Myno words were repeated.        informant (eighty-three years of age) has

Heengaged in all this.  also said that he as well as others used to get

empty tar-barrels, put a little tar into them, place them on their heads,

have the tar in them set on fire, and, with them blazing on their heads,
parade the village. About thirty years ago those in authority set them-
selves to put down the custom. The bonfire was erected as usual, but

the word went round that the kindling of it was to be prevented, and if
anyone succeeded in kindling it every endeavour would be made to ' droon't

oot,' and this could have been easily done, as the village pump is quite

close to the site of the bonfire. Nothing daunted, the villagers assembled

to wait the current of events. As the midnight hour approached, the
policeman made his appeai-ance carrying a pail. He came up to the pile,

put down his pail, and began to walk round and round the green. The

boys stood at a distance, peeping from e"\'ery corner, and watching if an

Aopportunity of throwing a piece of fire on the pile could be found.  few

yards from where it stood is a house in which lived at that time a woman

named Jess Clelland. Jess was on the side of the old custom, and she

was on the watch to outdo the men of authority. The policeman took a

rather wider turn than usual, and when his back was turned Jess seized a

burning peat from her hearth, rushed out, and thrust it into the 1)onfire.

"When the policeman turned he saw the pile in a blaze. He ran, seized

the pail, and made for the pump, The pump-handle was gone, and the

policeman withdrew. Jess gained the victory. Let Mi*. Lang indite an

ode to her.

tar-barrel is fixed on two long poles by means of two cross-bars. The
barrel is well filled with tar and paraftin. The whole is mounted on the
shoulders of four (?) men, and the contents of the barrel are set on fire,
The procession marches along the street past the ]:)ridge over the Cree

that leads to MinnigafF village. Wherx the end of tlie street is reached
the processionists retrace their steps till they come to tlie bridge. This

they cross and march through the village of Minnigaff to the green, where
the bonfire is now in full blaze. Here they get their barrel replenished

if need be. They then retrace their steps through the village and over the
bridge to Newton-Stewart, and then along the street to ' The Angle,' the
point from which they started. Here the poles and barrel are tlirown
down and the whole burned. During the procession the carriers of the
blazing barrel are changed every now and again. Last year an attempt

was made to put a stop to the procession, under the plea that it gave
occasion to much drunkenness. Mr. J. Reid, the minister of Minnigaff,

remonstrated with the autliorities against such a step, and most luckily

his remonstrance prevailed, and the procession took place with all order,

Mr. Reid himself being witness.

              The 'Hare:

--127. 3fochruni. Notwithstanding the introduction of reaping ma-

chines, the ' hai-e ' is still cut in the old fashion. Here is the mode of
Acutting it.
              small quantity is left to form the ' hare.' It is divided

into three parts and plaited, and the ears are tied into a knot. The

reapers then retire the distance of a few yards, and each throws his or

her 'heuk,' i.e. hook, in turn, and tries to hit and cut down the 'hare.'

It must be cut below the grain-knot, and the reapers continue to throw

their hooks in regular succession till one is skilful enough to cut it below

the knot. This one is said to be the ' best han',' and receives as reward

double the quantity of whisky the others receive. The ' hare ' is carried

home and given to the female servant in the kitchen, who places it over

the kitchen-door inside. The christian name of the first male that

enters the kitchen is the christian name of her future husband. If there

are several female servants, each in turn, as agreed, gets her chance.

The ' hare ' is allowed to hang for a considerable length of time in the

place where it is first laid.

  --128. Minnigaff. The 'hare' was often kept till the following

harvest.

  --129. Minnigaff. The one that cut the 'hare' carried it home and

placed it over the kitchen door, and the kitchenmaid had to kiss the first

man or boy that entered.

  --130. Inch. When the 'hare ' was cut, there was great cheering. It

was carried home and placed over the kitchen door. The goodwife had

to kiss the first male that entered.

  --131. Minnigaff. When the 'hare' was cut the unmarried reapers

ran with all speed home, and the one that reached it first was the first to

be married.

   --132. Mochrum. -In reaping grain during the time of harvest a reaper,

if a capable reaper, was set to reap ' a rigg.' The first ' rigg ' was called

the 'pint,' i.e. point, and the one that reaped was named the 'pintsman.'

The last ' rigg ' of those occupied by a set of reapers was called the ' heel,'
and the reaper bore the same name. In cutting the ' hare ' the ' pintsman '

was the first to throw the ' heuk,' and then each reaper threw in succes-

sion till it came to the ' heel,' if it had not been cut before. If not cut

the first round, the same mode was followed till it was cut.

  --133. Mochrum. The ' Winter,' i.e. the one that took the last load of

grain to the stackyard, was treated in a somewhat rough manner. Some

one of his fellow-servants watched for him to dash over him a quantity of

dirty water, and the dirtier so much the better. To avoid such a bath he

Myhim the dirty water went.   informant has been so served oftener

--than once.
    134. Mochrum. It may be stated that for each four capable reapers

there was one to bind and ' stook,' i.e. set the sheaves on end opposite

each other with the heads pressed together. There were commonly twelve

sheaves in the ' stook,' i.e. six on each side.

    My informants have all assisted in cutting the ' hare.' ·

 On the Method of determining the Value of Folklore as Ethnological Data.
                           By G. Laurence Gomme, F.S.A.

      The survey of one distinctive area, such as Galloway, by so well trained
 an observer as Dr. Gregor, has brought into notice a number of customs
 and superstitions differing from each other in form, motif and in almost
 all characteristics. The question is. Of what value is this material as
 data for ethnology, and how are we to find out the value ? The Com-
 mittee engaged upon this important inquiry will have collections from
 other parts of the British Isles, indeed, it is to be hoped, from all parts,
 before their work is finished ; and it is important that at this early stage
 it should be understood upon what basis they are going to work. Dr.
 Gregor has rightly put his collections into the suuple form of a catalogue.
 That is the only way in which they should appear fresh from the hands

--of the collector. But other branches of the survey physical types and

 measurements, material monuments, implements, and other evidence of

 --the history of the district from the earliest times though presented in the

 same unattractive form of a catalogue, are practically all ready to be dealt
            ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 627

      with upon approved and sjenerally recognised principles ; and it is in
       respect of folklore only that no principle lias been determined or even
      discussed, upon which to arrange the material placed before us.

            In the following pages I shall attempt to determine such a principle.
       For this pui'pose I shall need to select some one custom or belief as an
       illustration of the method of dealing with all items of custom and belief.
       Fortunately there is ample material to select from, and I shall take the

     fire custom at Minnigaft" (No. 122) for my purpose. I shall endeavour to

      show how this custom has to be treated if it is to he of value for ethno-
       graphical purposes ; and I shall suggest that each single custom and
      belief must be treated in the same way and on the same lines.

                         1. The Principles of Analysis and Classification.

           It is generally admitted that much of the custom and belief which is

     known under the name of folklore is ancient. How ancient, or, being

      ancient, how much it contributes to the history of ancient times, has not

       been determined. It is even questionable whether the general admission
       of the antiquity of popular custom and belief is of any value, because,

      although specialists who deal with the myths and early religions of the

        ancestors of civilised people use the evidence of folklore, the general

       historian is always loth to admit such evidence even if he is aware that it

         exists.

          The historian is not altogether to blame. He has nothing very
      definite to work upon. Even the great work of Grimm is open to the

       criticism that it does not prove the antiquity of popular custom and

I --belief it merely states the proposition, and then relies for proof upon the
       accumulation of an enormous number of examples and the almost entire
       impossibility of suggesting any other origin than that of antiquity for such
       a. mass of non-Christian material. Then the great work of Grimm,
       ethnographical in its methods, has never been followed up by similar work
       for other countries. The philosophy of folklore has taken up almost all
       the time of our scholars and students, and its contribution to the anthro-
       pology of the civilised races has not been made out.
             In all scientific investigation nothing is accepted as proved except
       upon the most careful and laborious investigation. Darwin's great work
       is the result of such an accumulation of experiments in all branches of
        natural history that no naturalist could, even if he would, aflbrd to neglect
       such evidence. The mathematical element of proof formed so large a
       proportion of the entire case that it was impossible to upset it unless, by
        following exactly the same laborious methods, it had been found that there
      was a mathematical answer to the pi'oblem as stated by Darwin. And no
        such answer has been forthcoming.
            The exact opposite of this process has obtained among investigators
       into the origin of custom and belief. The comparative method of inquiry
        has been used to an extreme extent. The unmeaning custom or belief of
        the peasantry of the western world of civilisation has been taken into the
        domains of savagery or barbarism for an explanation without any thought
        as to what this action really signifies to the history of the custom or belief
      in question. No doubt the explanation thus afforded is correct in most
        cases ; but I question whether such an explanation will be admitted as
        an important element in the history of European peoples until it has been
        proved to be scientifically justified. J?or it must be obvious that the
                                                                                                           ss2
628 REPORT--1896.

effective comparison of a traditional peasant custom or belief with a
savage custom or belief is only a very short cut indeed to the true process
that has been accomplished. This process includes the comparison of an
isolated custom or belief belonging, perhaps secretly, to a particular place,

a particular class of persons, or perhaps a particular family or person, with
a custom or belief which is part of a whole system belonging to a savage
race or tribe ; of a custom or belief whose only sanction is tradition, the
conservative instinct to do what has been done by one's ancestoz's, with a
custom or belief whose sanction is the professed and established polity or
religion of a people ; of a custom or belief which is embedded in a civilisa-
tion, of which it is not a part and to which it is antagonistic, with

a custom or belief which helps to make up the civilisation of which

it is part. In carrying out such a comparison, therefore, a very long
joui-ney back into the past of the civilised race has been performed, for
unless it be admitted that civilised people consciously borrow from savages
and barbaric peoples, or constantly revert to a savage original type oli

mental and social condition, the effect of such a comparison as we have
taken for an example is to take back the custom or belief of the modern
peasant to a date when a people of savage or barbaric culture occupied the
country now occupied by their descendants, the peasants in question, and

to compare the custom or belief of tliis ancient savage or barbaric culture
with the custom or belief of modern savage or barbaric culture. The line
of comparison is not therefore simply drawn level fi'om civilisation to
savagery ; but it consists, first, of two vertical lines from civilisation and
savagery respectively, drawn to a height scaled to represent the antiquity
of savage culture in modern Europe, and then the level horizontal line
drawn to join the two vertical lines. Thus the line of comparison is

ancient savagery   ancient savagery

savagery           civilisation

     The custom and belief of savage and barbaric races have been gene-
rally accepted as identical with the custom and belief of early or primitive
man. It has followed from this that wherever, as is so often the case,
the custom and belief surviving among the peoples of civilised countries-
are found to be exactly or nearly parallel to savage or barbaric custom and
belief, these survivals are put down as belonging to early or primitive
peoples. This conclusion is in the main correct ; but it is correct not
because it has been proved by the best methods to be so, but because, of

all possible explanations, this is the only one that meets the general posi-
tion in a satisfactory manner.

     If this be the short-cut process that has been accomplished by the

comparative method of research, it must be drawn out in detail if we

would scientifically prove its results, and if those results are to be recog-
nised by the historian as new data for the prehistoric periods. The
magnitude of such an enquiry as this suggests has to be considered. The
labour and research might in point of volume be out of proportion to the

results, and it may be questioned, as it has already been questioned by

inference, whether it is worth the while. The first answer to this objection
     ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. G29

is that all histoi'ical investigation is justified, however much the labour,

however extensive tlie research. Secondly, considering the very few results
which the study of folklore has hitherto produced upon the investigations
into Prehistoric Europe, it must be worth while for the student of custom
and belief to conduct his experiments upon a recognised plan in order to
get at the secret of man's place in the struggle for existence, which is
determined more by psychological than by physical phenomena. Thirdly,
if the psychical anthropology of prehistoric times is to be sought for in the
customs and beliefs of modern savages, it is of vital importance to anthropo-
logical science that this should be established by methods exactly detined.
Whatever of traditional custom and belief is capable of bearing the test

and of being definitely labelled as belonging to prehistoric man becomes

thereafter the data for the psychical anthropology of civilised man.

    Now if the several items of custom and belief preserved by tradition

are really ancient in their origin, they must be floating fragments, as it

--were, of an ancient system of custom and belief the cultus of the people

among whom they originated. This cultus has been destroyed. It has

either struggled unsuccessfully against foreign and more vigorous systems
of religion and society, or it has slowly developed from one stage to

another. In the western world at all events we know that the former
has been the process at work, and that it is matter of definite historical
record that all non-Christian culture has had to succumb to Christianity.
To be of service to the historian of our country and people, therefore, each
floating fragment of ancient custom and belief must not only be labelled
' ancient,' but it must be placed back in the system from which it has been
torn away. To do this is to a great extent to restore the ancient system

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and to restore an ancient system of culture, even if the restoration be
only a mosaic and a shattered mosaic, is to bring into evidence the pre-
historic race of people to which it belongs.

     This hypothesis of traditional custom and belief being relics of an
ancient cultus helps to form the method and principles of enquiry. It
would be impossible to suppose that all these relics have been preserved
equally well, all at the same stage cf arrested development, all equally
untouched by later influences. Their existence has been attacked in
different places, at different times, by different influences ; and therefore
the actual form of their survival must vary almost as frequently as an
example occurs. The modern connection of a custom or belief is no
sure guide, and is very often a misleading guide, to its ancient connection.
It is only by correct analysis and classification, therefore, that the various
examples can be put into a condition for examination and identification.

    We have for our purpose nothing more than a series of notes of cus-

toms and beliefs obtaining among the lower and lowest classes of the
people, and not being the direct teaching of any religious or academic
body. These notes are very unequal in value owing to the manner in
which they have been made. They are often accidental, they are seldom
if ever the result of trained observation, and they are often mixed up
with theories as to their origin and relationship to modern society and
modern religious beliefs.

     The method of using these notes for scientific purposes is therefore a
very important matter. It is essential that each single item should be
treated definitely and separately from all other items, and, further, that
the exact wording of the original note upon each separate item should be
kept intact. The original account of every custom and belief is an

630 REPORT--1896.

organism, not to be tampered with except for the purpose of scientific

analysis, and then after that purpose has been effected all the parts must

be put together again, and the oiiginal organism restored to its form.

The handling of each custom or belief and of its separate parts in this

way enables us, in the first place, to disentangle it from the particular

personal or social stratum in which it happens to have been preserved,

and, secondly, to j^repare it for the place to which it may ultimately be

found to belong. The first step in this preparation is to get together all the

examples which have been preserved, and to compare these examples with

each other, first as to common features of likeness, secondly as to features

of unlikeness. By this process we are able to restore whatever may be

--really deficient from insufficiency of any particular record and such a
--restoration is above all things essential and to present for examination

not an isolated specimen but a series of specimens, each of which helps to

bring back to observation some portion of the original.

The first important characteristic which distinguishes a custom or

belief in survival from a custom or belief belonginc; to an established

system is that not only do different examples present points of common

likeness, but also points of unlikeness. The points of likeness are used

to determine and classify all the examples of one custom or belief, the

points of unlikeness to trace out the line of decay inherent in survivals.

This partial equation and partial divergence between different examples

of the same custom or belief allows a very important point to be made in

Wethe study of survivals.  can estimate the value of the elements which

equate in any number of examples, and the value of the elements which

diverge ; and by noting how these values differ in the various examples

we may discover an overlapping of example with example which is of the

Autmost importance.  certain custom consists, say, of six elements, «, h^

c, d, e,/. Another example of the same custom has four of these elements,

Aa, b, c, (I, and two divergences, g, h.              third example has elements

Aa, b, and divergences </, h, i, k.       further example has none of the

radical  elements,  but only divergences          h,  i,  I,  m.  Then the statement

                                            ff,

of the case is reduced to the followinc: :

ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 631

Howelements ; ' and the question is,                                            can these be determined ? As a rule

it will be found that the radical elements are the most constant parts of

the whole group of examples, appearing more frequently, possessing

greater adherence to a common form, changing (when they do change) with

slighter  variations                                         while  the  divergent  elements,                                  on  the  other  hand,
                                                          ;

assume many different varieties of form, are by no means of constant

occurrence, and do not even amongst themselves tend to a common form.

To these considerations, derived entirely from a study of the analysis, is

to be added the fact that the radical elements are alone capable of being

equated with customs or beliefs obtaining among savage or barbaric

peoples.

    When any given custom or belief, having undergone this double pro-

cess of analysis of component elements and classification of the individual

examples, reveals a distinct parallel between its radical elements and the

elements of a custom or belief occupying a place in the cultus of a barbaric

or savage people, we may then, and only then, discuss its right to a gene-

alogy which can be traced back to a prehistoric cultus of the same stage

of development as that of modern barbarism or savagery. This right will

depend upon several important conditions. The custom in question must

in the first place be not a single isolated example of such a possible ge-

nealogy, but must be found associated with several other customs, each of

which, being treated in exactly the same manner, has been found to ex-

hibit exactly the same relationship to the same barbaric or savage cultus

or religion. In this way classification and analysis go hand in hand as

the necessary methods of studying survivals. Without analysis we cannot

properly arrive  at  a                                       classification of  examples                                       without classification we
                                                                                                                            ;

cannot work out the genealogy of survivals. The argument for detecting

in modern survivals the last fragments of a once prevailing system basea

upon this extensive groundwork is of itself a very strong one, and can

only be upset by one counter argument. This is nothing less than proof

that no such system ever existed, or could have possibly existed, in the
country or among the people, where and among which the survivals have

been discovered. Clearly the burden of such a proof could hardly be sup-

ported ; for the very fact of the existence of such survivals becomes in
itself one of the strongest arguments for the existence of the original

system from which they descended, and of the race or people among

whom such original system obtained.

                               2. Fire Rites and Ceremonies.

     The particular custom which I purpose examining on the principles
laid down relates to the use of fire. I shall not attempt to draw any
general conclusions until the work of analysis and classification is
completed, but shall first of all simply put together the evidence as it
appears from the notes of the collectors and chroniclers of this group
of customs. Apart, however, from general conclusioiis, there are a
few special characteristics which it will be well to specify during the
progress of our work, partly because their significance would not appear
so usefully if deferred until the work of analysis and classification is
completed, and partly to avoid what must always be an obstacle to

--researches of this kind namely, repetition of description.

     The most important example is the well-known custom of burning
the clavie at Burghead. The fire is made by the youths of the village,
who must be the sons of the original inhabitants, and every stranger is
632 REPORT--1896.

rigidly excluded from the cereinony.' This is a clear recognition of the
blood bond, because the early ties of relationship still hold their place
against the later ties of locality, a mere resident not being recognised as a
person fitted to take part in the ceremony. Secondly, the clavie must be
lighted by a burning peat, the custom being that no form of modern
lighting is allowed to approach the precincts.^ The next point is that

the smoking embers of the clavie were scattered among the assembled

villagers, by whom they were eagerly caught at, and with them the fire on

the cottage hearth was at once kindled.^

    The date fixed upon for the ceremony, namely, New Year's Eve, is the

next important element to note, it being obvious that a fire kindled on the
last day of the old year, and allowed to burn into the first morning of the

new year, has carried on its flame from one year to another, though actually

--only through one year's end into another year a fiction which may very well

stand for an original perpetual burning. And, finally, there are details of
ritual in this custom which are as significant of archaic origin as they could
well be. The object of the ceremony is the perambulation, with the sacred

fire, of the bounds of the village and of the fishing boats. At certain houses

and at certain street corners a halt was made, and a brand whipped out

of the clavie and hurled among the crowd. He who seized the brand was

the favourite of fortune during the nionths of the coming new year. After-
wards the fire was carried to a small artificial promontory, where a circular
heap of stones, called the ' Durie,' was built up for the purpose, and the
still burning clavie was jslaced in the hollow centre, from which it was
distributed to the villagers.^ The whole community joined in the ceremony
as an act necessary to its welfare and prosperity during the year. If the
bearer stumbled it was looked upon as a dire calamity foretelling disaster
to the place, and certain death to the bearer in the course of the next
year."* As the ceremony was therefore a sacred one, those who took
part in it, especially those who acted as carriers of the fire, would be

honoured above their fellows by the distinction. Accordingly, in the
clavie custom, ' the first lift is an honour,' and was usually conferred upon

some member of the community who had recently been married. As soon

as one bearer gave signs of exhaustion, another took his place, and should
any of them meet with an accident during the journey ' the misfortune
excites no pity even among his near relatives.' ^

      Injury in the service of the fire is clearly not a misfortune, but a
sign of I'ecognition of dutiful service ; and it is just possible that

the prominence given to the recently married member of the community
may represent some early recognition of the service thereby rendered in

securing a future mother of the kindred. In entire keeping with these
very significant facts are the details attending the construction of the fire-
pile. ' Unwritten but unvarying laws ' regulate every action, one of

which laws is that every article is borrowed, nothing bought. And in

this we have, I think, a clear indication of the time when personal
property in the nature of tools was not the subject of barter --a time,
that is, before the days of commercial economics, and consequently coinci-

dent with tribal society. This indication of a prehistoric date for the
origin of the custom is confirmed by one other detail, namely, that although

the long nail which fastens the staves of the clavie is iron, and is made
specially for the purpose by the village smith, the hammer used for the
purpose must be a round stone.'

    The completeness of the Burghead example in so many details of

signiticance enables us to fix upon it as the typical form of survival of the
fire-custom. The justification for this conclusion will appear later on, when
we have fully examined the other examples and compared them with the
Burghead example; but in the meantime I can state that it has no parallel
for completeness anywhere. I will now set out the elements it contains

in the shape of a formula, so that reference back to these elements may
be made in as simple manner as possible. The following is the formula

required :

    (a) The fire is made by a group of men connected by a common

descent, that is, a kindred.

     (5) The original inhabitants of a village form the unit from which
common descent is traced.

     (c) The flame for the fire is obtained in a sacred manner.
      (d) Continuous life of the fire (symbolised).
     (e) The house-fire is derived from the village-fire.
     (/) The possession of an ember is the means of good fortune.
     (g) The bounds of the village have the fire carried round them.
     (h) Welfare and prosperity of the community dependent upon the
performance of the ceremony.
     (i) The bearers of the fire are honoured.
      (k) Early economic conditions are enforced in the performance of the

ceremony.
      (l) Stone-age implements are used.

   A custom in Lanarkshire has preserved some essential elements of the

Burghead example. Thus, at Biggar the villagers collect a large quantity
of fuel, and about nine o'clock on the last day of the old year the pile is
lighted, each member of the crowd ' thinking it a duty to cast into the
flaming mass some additional portion of material.' It is necessary to

maintain the fire until New Year's day is far advanced, and if the house

fire has been allowed to become extinguished, recourse must be had to the
village pile.'-* Here the collective action of the villagers, the connection
between the village-fire and the house-fires, and the symbolical continuation
of the fire from one year to the next year, are still closely preserved. But
the sanction for the proceeding has changed. In the Burghead example
 the prosperity of the whole community depended upon the lighting of the
 village-fire ; in the Biggar example it was to provide the flame for the house-

fire on account of the unluck of giving out fire on New Year's day. The

 two sanctions, different in form, are practically identical in motif; the
 Burghead example in this, as in other features, is the more archaic ; the
 Biggar example has assumed the usual condition of survivals and substituted
 the non-specific notion of unluck for the specific notion of prosperity of
 the community as the sanction for the ceremony of the village-fire. In
 this respect the Biggar example is an important link in the evidence we are

     ' Folklore Journal, vii. 13. The stone is thrown away after use ; and it may be
 that in this act we have an indication of the sacred character of the stone, in that it

now seeking. It is, on the one hand, definitely connected with the

form preserved at Burghead; on the other hand it departs from that form
in one important particular which, however, as we shall see, reappears in

many other examples which do not equate so nearly in other respects with
the Burghead example. Thus, we have a partial equation and a partial

divergence in the Biggar example, as compared with the typical form of

Burghead, and the formula would appear as follows :

(b) Making the fire by group of co- villagers.

{d) Continuous life of the village-fire,
(e) Lighting of the family fires by the village-fire,
(m) Unlucky to give fire from the house.

So that the Biggar example equates with the typical foi'm at Burghead in
three elements, and introduces the first divergence in the belief of unluck
attending the giving out of fire from the house. That this belief is an
essential part of the custom is an important factor in the argument

it is because of this taboo against giving fire from the house that the
village-fire is necessary, and the two conceptions are part and parcel of the

same set of beliefs.

   We can now go forward to examine other examples of the fire cus-

tom. In the country parts of Ireland (unfortunately no direct locality is
fixed upon) the May-day fire was formed by the inhabitants of each village.

When the fire had nearly expired each individual present provided himself

with a braune or ember of the fire to carry home, and if it becomes
extinguished before reaching the house it is an omen of impending mis-
fortune ; the new fire is kindled with this spark. They also throw lighted
embers into the cornfields, or among the potato crops or the fiax to preserve
them from witchcraft and to ensure a good return. ' Here there are three
elements of the typical form, h, e, and g ; and possibly a variation of f.

The divergences, however, are extremely impoi'tant. Many of the old

people might be seen circumambulating the tire and repeating to them-

selves certain prayers. If a man was about to perform a long journey he

leaped backwards and forwards three times through the fire to give him
success in his undertaking ; if about to wed he did it to purify himself for

the marriage state ; if going to undertake some hazardous enterprise he

did it to render himself invulnerable ; as the fire sank low the girls tripped

across it to procure good husbands, women great with child to ensure a

happy delivery ; and children were carried across.^ These details give us
two additional divergences, namely :

(?i) Walking round the fire saying prayers.
(o) Passing through the fii'e for success and good luck.

The significance of these rites lies in the fact that they are perfoi'med

for the express purpose of obtaining aid in time of need. They brought

the devotee into direct and close contact with the fire, and hence

obtained for him its protection.  This  is  the  meaning of  the  ceremony
                                                                                                   ;

and it allows no room for a trace of a malevolent deity demanding

sacrifice, whether human or animal, all the evidence pointing to a

     ' Wilde's Irish Popular SiipernHtions, 49 ; Vallancey, Collectanea, ii. 67, records

beneficent influence affording help to those who performed the necessary-

rites. Other examples only confirm this view, the significance of wliich

will presently appear. The Manx custom was to light fiies on the hill-

tops on the eve of St. John the Baptist and on May-day. The household
fires were put out on that day and rekindled with some of the sacred fire.
This fire was also placed on the windward side of fields, so that the smoke
might pass over the corn ; and the cattle were driven between two fires as
an antidote against murrain or any pestilential distemper.' This preserves

--four elements of the typical form b, d, e, and g and one important

divergence, o. The contact with fire as the means of obtaining its
support is here extended to animals. Beginning with the fields and boats
in the Burghead type form, the action was extended to crops generally,
and to human beings in the Irish example, and to the corn crops and

animals in the Manx example. There can be no doubt that we are

dealing with the same rite in all these cases ; and as no idea of a sacrifice
could occur in the case of the fields and crops, as no idea of a sacrifice is

conveyed by the actual ceremony performed by animals and human beings,

it is important to note that the evidence so far distinctly points to the
conception of contact with some sacred power to ensure help and jjrotec-
tion, and therefore negatives any supposition of a sacrifice. In the
western islands of Scotland the ceremony was for " eighty-one married

men (being thought the necessary number for effecting this design) " to

take two great planks of wood, and nine of them were employed by turns
to rub one of the planks against the other until the heat thereof produced
fire. From this forced fire each family is supplied with new flame to light
its household fire which had previously been put out.^ Elsewhere it is
mentioned that it was an ancient custom to make a fiery circle about the

houses, corn, cattle, itc, belonging to each particular family ; a man carried

fire in his right hand and went round. ^ This example equates with ele-
ments 6, e, and g of the type, and sujjplies a new and very important
variant of the method of kindling the fire, c.

     In the Burghead example it was noted that the sanction of married

life was an element in the choice of the man who was to be the bearer of

the fire ; in this western isle example it is the same sanction which governs

the choice of the men to create the fire, and the significant repetition of
this feature cannot be wholly due to accident. But the Scottish historian,

Hector Boece, tells a curious legend about the fire on the same island

--Lewis to which Martin refers. ' The fame is,' says Boece, ' als sone as

the fire gangis furth (dies out) in this ile, the man that is haldin of maist
clone and innocent life layis one wosp of stra on the alter, and when the

pepill are gevin maist devotly to thair jiraers, the wosp kindelies in ane
bleis.'"* Here the resort is to the church, where miraculous fire is obtained

for the same purpose as the sacred forced fire ; and it may be that we have

a late example of the method the Church adopted to occupy the place of

the older religion. The point is of some importance, because we shall
presently have to note the survival of these fire customs among the ritual

observances of the early Church.
     All these examples point to a periodical renewal of fire on some par-

ticular day, the last day of the old year, May eve, and so on ; and the

significance of these, in the indication they give of continuous life, has been

noted. I now come to examples of sacred fires which are not created on

a particular day, but for a particular purpose. The points of contact

between the two groups of examples are, however, many. The alleged

purpose of the lire in these new examples is the same as one of the cere-

monies performed during the fire ritual in the examples just given ; the

actual mode of  creating  the fire is the  same                            the connection between the
                                                                        ;

village-fire and the house-fires is the same. In short, the elements of each

example are the same, but the assumed importance of each element in the

popular mind is not the same.

In the isle of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland, the people carried

to the top of Carnmoor a wheel and nine spindles of oak-wood. They

extinguished every tire in every house within sight of the hill, and the

wheel was then turned from east to west over the nine spindles long

enough to produce fire by friction. They then sacrificed a heifer, cutting

in pieces and burning while yet alive the diseased part. Finally, they

lighted their own hearths from the pile, and ended by feasting on the

remains of the heifer. The cause of the ceremony was to cure the disease

among the black cattle.' Here we have three elements of the typical form

b, c, and e, and the important divergence o. More important, how-

ever, are the facts of sacrifice and the sacred feast ; and I suggest that

these are not radical elements, but signs of the degradation of the ritual

into other uses or channels. Clearly there is no connection between the

sacrifice and the ceremony of lighting the house-fires from the village-fire
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

and as this element is the strongest link to the other examples which have

been examined it must be regarded as the test of origins. Another form

of this example confirms this view. In the Highlands and in Caithness

new fires were made ' to defeat sorceries.' ' Certain persons who have the

power to do so ' were sent for to raise the new fire.- The qualification of
the persons engaged in the ceremony is extremely important. It may

point to a kind of priesthood, or to the descendants of persons originally

Upqualified.    to the present it is remarkable that no idea of a priesthood

is hinted at in these customs and on this I shall have something to say
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

presently ; while in the Burghead typical form common descent from origi-
nally qualified persons, who were not priests, appears. In the absence,
then, of direct evidence on this important point, I am inclined to class the

* certain persons ' of the Caithness custom with the common descendants

of qualified persons of the Burghead custom.'* The ceremonial of creating

the fire is very curious. Upon any small island in a river or lake a cir-

cular booth of stone or turf was erected, on which a couple or rafter of a

birch tree was placed, and the roof covered over. In the centre was set a

perpendicular post fixed by a wooden pin to the couple, the lower end

being placed in an oblong groove on the floor, and another pole was placed

horizontally between the upright post and the legs of the couple, into

both of which the ends, being tapered, were inserted. This horizontal

Survey of Caithness, the same ceremony as that described by Logan, which, however,
says, instead of ' certain persons,' that ' charm doctors ' superintended the lighting of
the new fire. This, of course, may point to a priesthood, but I do not think it does,
and the point needs further investigation.

timber was called the auger, being provided with four short arms or

spokes by which it could be turned round. As many men as could be

coUected'are then set to work, having first divested themselves of all kinds

of metal. From this the new fire was instantly procured, and all other

fires having been quenched with water ' they were rekindled from the new-

fire and accounted sacred ; and the cattle were successively made to smell
them. 2 In many ways this is more important than the Mull example.
It gives five elements, a, b, c, e, and 2, and the important divergence
o, which imposes the smelling of the fire by the cattle. In this

latter incident lies the justification for asserting that cattle sacrifice

is no part of this ritual. It is contact with the sacred element which
is necessary, not sacrifice. So, too, in Moray, when a contagious dis-
ease occurred among the cattle, the people of the villages extinguished

all their liousehold tires and tlien produced a fire by means of friction. On

this a vessel was placed in which juniper branches were boiled, and with

this decoction all the cattle were sprinkled. On the conclusion of the

ceremonies the household fires were relighted by a brand from the friction

fire.^ Shaw wrote this account in the last century, and it is somewhat

difl&cult to localise the customs he records. He says that the midsummer

solemnity was celebrated by making ' the deas-soil about their fields of
corn with burning torches of wood in their hands to obtain a blessing on

their corns.' On Midsummer eve ' they kindle fires near their corn fields

and walk round them with burning torches,' and ' the like solemnity was
kept on the eve of the first of November as a thanksgiving for the safe
ingathering of the produce of the fields.'^ This example yields five ele-

ments, 6, c, d, e, and g ; and it accentuates the conception of contact with,
rather than sacrifice to, fire by the act of sprinkling water heated by fire
instead of the natural action of the smoke as an indication of contact.

     With these facts before us we pass on to the well-known example at
Kildare sanctioned and upheld by the Christian Church. Giraldus Cam-

brensis is the authority for this. He says that ' the nuns and holy women

tend and feed the fire, adding fuel with such watchful care that from the
time of St. Bridget it has continued burning through a long course of
years.' Twenty nuns were engaged. Each of them had the care of the
fire for a single night in turn, and on the evening before the twentieth
night, the last nun, having heaped wood upon the fire, said : ' Bridget, take

charge of your own fire, for this night belongs to you.' The nuns then left
the fire, and in the morning it was found alight as usual. The fire was
surrounded by a hedge made of stakes and brushwood, and forming a

circle within which no male could enter.^ Giraldus wrote in the twelfth
century, and St. Bridget was born, according to tradition, in 453. This
would give a life of seven hundred years for this fire. Henry de Londres,
Archbishop of Dublin, caused it to be extinguished in 1220, but it was
afterwards again lighted and remained so until the suppression of the
monasteries by Henry VIII.^ This supplies remarkable evidence of the
fact of perpetual fire, which has only been symbolised in the examples
hitherto adduced, but on the other hand the adaptation to church and

monastic purposes has left the Kildare example shorn of other primitive

charactei'istics, except perhaps the substitution of an artificial kindred,

the monastic group, for the real kindred. There are also two divergent

elements, f, q, in the virgin attendants and the circular form of the fire.
It leads us, however, to the action of the Church elsewhere. In the

island of Inismurray is the church of Teach-na-Teinedh, or the Chuich of

Fire, and there was formerly a remarkable flagstone upon which, accord-

ing to tradition, the monks kept a fire always burning for use by the

islanders.' The flagstone is called Leac-na-Teinidh, the Stone of Fire.

It consists of seven stones, four of which are placed on edge and set

deeply in the ground in the manner of a cist. The sides face as nearly

as possible the cardinal points, and are in position not coincident with

the surrounding walls of the church. The natives aver that here of old

burnt a perpetual fire, from which, all the hearths on the island which

from any cause had become extinguished were rekindled.^ Here we have

elements a, d, and e, and the fact of perpetual fire. In England, church-

wardens'  accounts  contain  entries  of  payment  for  fuel  '  for  the  holy                  ;  '  ^

                                                                                 fire

and the explanation of these entries is that hallowed or holy fire was

kindled in the church porch on the morning of Easter Eve, and was

obtained from the sun by means of a cry.stal or burning glass if the

morning was bright, or a flint and steel if the weather was unpropitious.

This fire was blessed by the priest, and from it the Paschal candle, the

lamps of the church, and the candles on the altar were lighted for Easter

Day. The people, too, took home with them a light from the sanctuary,

and the hearth that had been allowed to become cold and brandless then

became wai-m and bright once more, and the evening candle shone

brightly again with a flame from the new hallowed fire."* This would

seem almost to be a direct handing on of the pagan sacred fire to the

Christian priesthood. At least four elements, a, c, d, and e, of the type

are preserved, the continuation of the light from Easter eve to Easter

morn being of the same characteristic as that from New Year's eve to
New Year's morn already dealt with, as Easter was looked upon by the

early Church as the beginning of the Christian year.''

Finally we turn from the church to the record evidence of the Irish

tribal system. In an ancient tract which was written at the time of the

break-up of the Irish tribal system, and shows the transition from blood-

ties to economical ties, a chieftain, who is not noble, but who represents

the tribesmen as their chief official, stands out as the outcome of this

the ceremony above described is necessary, and he draws it up ' from the older ritual
and the early liturgical writers in those parts of (lermany which heard and took their
(Jhristian belief from Anglo-Saxon preachers.'

    * There may he something of archaic significance, too, in Dr. Rook's observation

that ' for church use at least this fire might truly be said to have lived the whole year
through, for as lamp was lighted from lamp it thus kept on burning from one Holy

transition period. He was known as the Bruighfer chief ; and among his

duties and privileges, enumerated with the usual precision of the Irish
legal treatises, are certain objects which ' he shall have without borrow-

--ing a grinding-stone, a mallet, an axe, a hatchet, a spear for killing

cattle, ever-living fire, a candle upon a candelabra without fail, a perfect
plough with all its requirements.' ' I refer back to the Burghead custom
to note the significant parallel in the taboo against borrowed articles, ^ to
the specified articles themselves in connection with the consti'uction of the
clavie, and to the ' ever-living fire ' of the Bruighfer chief.

     Here the examination of the more perfect examples of the custom

--fire that is, those which contain the element of the house-fires of the
--family units being derived from the village-fire ends ; and we must next

ask as to the less perfect examples. These will be found to consist of

many well-known, but little understood, customs, which equate with the

examples just dealt with in one or more particulars, and which gradually
shade oflT into examples which have reached the last stages of decadence.
Perhaps with few other instances of traditional usage has the unfettered
imagination of writers been more busy than with this. The lighting of
fii'es at Easter, May-day, Midsummer, and Yule, has been so wide-

spread in the Celtic parts of the islands that the subject has been
peculiarly attractive to every school of Celtic scholarship. The result is

unfortunate for the cause of science. It has served to make the subject
peculiarly distasteful to sober inquirers who do not care to go on a roving
expedition to Phcenicia and all sorts of ancient civilisations for the origin
of a cult the remnants of which exist in modern Britain ; and hence very
little attention has been given to the evidence supplied by the customs
themselves when studied with due regard to scientific conditions.

      Leaving out of consideration all those general statements as to lighting
of fires on particular festivals, which do not supply any of the details which
have been the subject of particular observation, I will proceed to classify
those definite examples of ceremonial fires which do not contain the

essential feature of supplying the flame for the household fire, the object

of the classification being to see how far their elements equate with the
elements of the more perfect examples already examined.

     In Cornwall the festival fires were kindled on the eve of St. John the
Baptist. The people attended with lighted torches and made their
perambulations round the fires and proceeded from village to village.^
Later writers give further details, but do not state that the house-fires

were lighted from the village-fire. At Penzance young men and women
passed up and down the streets where fires were lighted, swinging round

their heads heavy torches, the flames of which almost equalled those of

tar-barrels. At the close of the proceedings a great number of persons of

both sexes used to join hand in hand forming a long string, and running
through the streets playing thread-the-needle, and leaping over the yet
glowing embers.^ Sir Arthur Mitchell, has collected from the Kirk

' Brelwn Law Tracts, iv. 311.

     - It seems probable that the word bonfire is derived from boon-fire, i.e. from he
fact that the materials were obtained by boons gathered from everyone in the neigh-
bourhood. (See Ellis's Brand, i. 301.) Murray, however, decides that etymologi-

cally the derivation is from bone fire.

many interesting particulars of the attempt to put down the burning of

clavies round the boats and the fields of the fisherfolk and peasantry in
the country round about Burghead, attempts which take back the custom
to 1655, when it was considered an ancient 'idolatrous and heathenish
practice,' and shows that the custom of ' burning the clavie is not a

ceremony peculiar to Ijurghead, and has no special connection either with

that spot or with a sea-going community.' ' At Warkworth in North-

umberland every year the farmers kindled a new fire with some ceremony

at a certain farm agreed upon, and the cattle were then shut up in the
straw barn, where the fire was kept up among them for some time, after

which a lighted brand was carried on to the next farm where preparations

had been made for a similar proceeding. If the In-and went out, the virtue
was gone ; and that year would be looked forward to with dread of many
deaths among the herd.'^ In Herefordshire and Somersetshire fires wei'e

made in the fields to bless the apples.^ It will be readily detected that

these examples contain four elements Avhich belong also to the group of
examples just examined, b, c, g, h, and only one divergent element, namely,

the Penzance thread-the-needle ceremony (r). Perhaps the Warkworth

custom of carrying fire from farm to farm is the divergent form (s) of the

lighting of the house-fire at the village-fire.

     One thing further has to be noticed, and this is of singular interest to

the present line of enquiry, because it links on fire customs to an im-

portant social institution. The meeting -place of the tribe, sacred to it

in many ways, is preserved in many places throughout the kingdom ; and

some years ago I collected the evidence together in my little book ' Primi-
Wetive Folk Moots.'
                     have seen how the fire is connected with the tribal

chieftains in Irish evidence, and we know that the care of the tribal fire

was a part of the chief's duty as priest-king of the tribe. The relation-

ship of the place of fire-kindling to the place of meeting is therefore an

important feature of the cult. Is it to be found among the surviving

fire customs of the class we have been examining 1

   A splendid example is to be found in Ayrshire. The Torbolton moot

hill and the ancient so-called altar for kindling the tire adjoin each other.

The moot hill was used as a meeting-place until recent times, while the

fire-kindlin"- is carried on to this day. The date is the nearest Tuesday

to June 3 ; the fire is kept burning for three days, and the boys of the

neit^hbourhood indulge in the ancient practice of ' leaping on the altar.' ''

I have not been able yet to give other examples of the close connection

between the tribal meeting-place and the  place  for kindling the fire                                                                                                           but
                                                                                                                                                                              ;

I suggest that the various toot hills throughout the country, and the

many examples of a second and smaller hill, or a second and smaller stone,

which occur near to the hill or stone of meeting, afford ample ground for

believing that the necessary evidence will be forthcoming when my

researches are completed.

    These examples complete the evidence I am able to bring forward as
to the village phase of the fire custom, and I will now tabulate the results

up to this point. The following table gives the result of the analysis of

nature of the sanctity conveyed from the village fire to the house-fires?

Perhaps we may not get this question answered from the evidence

afforded by British usage ; but at all events it leads up to another pertinent
question, namely, whether the kindling of the house-fires from the village-
fire on one particular day in the year signifies the sanctity of the house-
fire on that particular day only, or a sanctity which can only be conveyed
by contact with the village-fire. There can be little doubt that the latter
is the true interpretation of the rite ; and it carries with it the assumption
that throughout the year, from one anniversary of the formal lighting of
the village-fire to another, the house-fire must have retained the sanctity
derived from the village -fire. The only method of doing this is by con-
tinuous life, a feature we are already familiar with in connection with the

village-fire.

     The examples to be taken first are those house-fires which have already
been mentioned as actually derived from the village-fire. The house-tires
of Burghead, having been kindled from the clavie as already described,
were kept up throughout the year, ' it being considered lucky to keep the
flame from the clavie all the rest of the year.' ' The Lanarkshire example
is not so perfect, the continuous life . of the house-tire, lighted from the
village pile, being represented only for the period of transition from old
year to new year, and not for the actual year, it being considered ' un-
lucky to give out a light to anyone on the morning of the new year.' ^
The Irish example falls into line by the evidence of Sir William Wilde

that ' portions of the extinguished [village] tire are generally retained in

--each family ' ·* a form which we may accept as an obvious divergence from

the continuous house-tire. In the Manx evidence we once more get a per-

fect form. There is not one of the native families ' but keeps a small
quantity of tire continually burning, no one daring to depend on his
neighbour's vigilance in a thing which he imagines is of such consequence,
everyone consequently believing that if it should happen that no tire were
to be found throughout tho island most terrible revolution and mischief
would immediately ensue.' ^ The Western Islands example again is not
so clear, Martin simply saying that ' the tires in the j^arish were extin-

guished,' 5 each family being then supplied with new flame from the

village-fire ; but there can be little doubt that the continuous life of the
house-fire is here symbolised if not actually recorded. In one of the
islands of St. Kilda the evidence is complete. Turf fires are always kept
burning, and if one happens to go out a live turf is borrowed from a
neighbour. The fires of St. Kilda have probably been burning for
centuries.'' The fact of continuous life and its syrabolisation in a recog-
nised form are therefore both represented in these examples.

     In the next grouj) of examples we have the house-tires kept alive

perpetually without renewal from the village-fire. This divergence from
the more primitive form need not surprise us. The more archaic
elements in the fire-cult would be the first to die out before the march of

new social and economical ideas, and these are undoubtedly those ele-

iiients which belong to the village phase. The family element, left to
struggle on by itself, would take upon itself some of the features thus lost,

especially such an extremely important characteristic as that of perpetual

life. This is the explanation of the following remarkable survival. In
Lakeland of northern England the old hearth-fire was raked or put into a

condition of smouldering at nights with superstitious reverence, and was
thus ' kept up from day to day, from month to month, from year to year,
and from generation to generation,' and more instances than one are

known ' where the house-fire had been kept up for three generations, and

during all that time had been so zealously guarded that it had not been

once allowed to go out. There is a well-known instance where a man had
what he called his "grandfather's fire," that is, a fire that was known to

have been kept up without extinction for at least three generations, and

when it once accidentally went out he went to some woodcutters who had

lighted their fire from his and brought back from their fire a fire to his

own hearth, that thus he might possess as it were the seeds of his ances-

tors' original fire.' ' The elimination of the ceremony of annual renewal

in this case has caused the accentuation of the idea of perpetual life, but

the process for renewal where perpetual life has been broken by accident

brings back the old conception of the house-fire being derived from a

sacred source.

This example, significant as it is of itself, becomes all the more so

when it is discovered that other examples of the house-fire which do not

renew their life annually from the village-fire have adopted a form of

annual renewal which cannot but be considered as due to an original

Werenewal from the village-fire.  have seen above that this particular

element would be the first to give way before advancing civilisation.

Granting that this had taken place in cases where the perpetuation of

the cult of the house-fire was inclined to go on much longer in sur-

vival, we should get a form of annual renewal minus the village- fire from

Awhich such renewal was obtained.  further advance in the line of

degradation may lead us to a form of annual renewal where not only

has the village-fire ceased to be a part of the ceremony, but some other

element has been introduced into the gap caused by the village-fire

having dropped out of the ceremony. Thus there are two groups of fire

--customs to allow for one where annual renewal pure and simple takes

place, or is symbolised as taking place ; the second where annual renewal
takes place in connection with some other element than that of fire.

     The examples where the annual renewal is symbolised are numerous.

They take the following forms : embers of a particular fire are preserved
to light the next anniversary fire, old and new fires being thus connected

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the fire of New Year's eve in the old year is kept alight until New Year's

morn in the new year, old and new years being thus connected by an un-

extinguished fire ; the prohibition against giving light out of the house at
certain sacred periods, or on certain sacred days, the life of eA'ery house-

fire being thus held to be sacred on that day and kept up by the house-
family itself and not by kindling from without. Variations of these forms
will of course occur, but these variations do not suggest new forms of the

symbolisation of the annual renewal of the house-fire. They only show
the direction which degradation of the survivals takes when once symbo-
lisation is made to do duty for actual fact.

In these cases annual renewal from an old fire, which was in turn

derived from an old fire, and so on backwards, takes back the 'seed of the

fire ' to the original method of obtainizig it, namely, from the village-
fire ; and in this way these imperfect examples are connected with the per-
fect examples. But the formula of annual renewal also contains the

formula of continuous life, and it becomes a ' struggle for existence ' be-

tween these two formulse as to which should ultimately prevail in deter-

mining the form which each survival should finally take. In the first

of the above-mentioned groups both  formula;  appear                              in  the  second  and
                                                                               ;

third only the symbolism of continuous life ; and thus we obtain a very

instructive lesson in the process of degradation in survivals.

Of the first form a Nottinghamshire example is the best. There must

always be a portion of last year's yule log left in the house to be burnt

upon the next Christmas eve. The method is to first put a bit of last

year's log into the fireplace and burn it, then the fresh log must be put on

the fire and be allowed to burn for a little while. It must then be taken

off and burnt a little every night until New Year's eve, when it is put on

the fire and burnt, all except the small portion which is kept in the house

until next Christmas Day. It is believed that the observance of this

custom will ' keep the witch away.' ' I do not think the significance of

this piece of ritual will be lost upon any student ; and the sanction for its

due observance is the safety of the household, the same sanction, that is,

which was noted among the survivals of the tribal fire rites at Burghead,

in the Isle of Man, and elsewhere. In Lincolnshire the yule log was placed

with ceremony on the fii'e on Christmas eve, the unconsumed part of the

old log having been carefully preserved to burn with the new one.^ In

Northamptonshire it is taken from the fire when only half burnt and care-

fully preserved in a cellar or some other safe place, its possession being

looked upon as bringing good luck to the house and preventing fire

throughout the coming year.'' This last divergence in the form of pro-

.itection obtained from the fire is clearly a modern addition due to associa-

 tion of ideas ; and we next come upon an example of this form of
..protection when it is unaccompanied, as in the present case, with the more

archaic conception of safety to the family being bound up with the

preservation of the sacred lire. In Northumberland a fragment of the

Christmas log was saved for next Christmas,'' during which time it secures

the house from fire, and a small piece of it thrown into a fire occurring at

Aeither the log or the candle till the proper period.                             piece of the candle

is also kept to ensure good luck.-^ Here yule log and yule candle are

evidently struggling for mastery as the emblem of the house-fire annually

renewed, while the foreign element of protection from fire receives its

 most advanced form. The same evidence is derived from the district of

.

Nidderdale. Thei'e the fag-end of last year's yule log is used to light the

new one, which in its turn is saved for a like purpose in the following year.

.Each house is provided with twelve or more candles, which are all lighted

together on Christmas eve, and the members of the household hold tliem

in their fingers alight for about ten minutes, when all but one are extin-

guished, and the one is left to cut the cheese by. After dark no person

must take a light out of doors, as it is considered unlucky to do so.' In

the North Riding of Yorkshire a large tire, known as yule clog, is made on

Christmas eve, a piece of the clog being carefully preserved by the house-

wife, and on New Year's eve no one will suffer a light to be taken from

Wehis tire.^  now turn to the simplest form of this group. In Cornwall,

the Christmas log was lighted by a portion saved from the last year's

fire.^

     Of the second group the most remarkable example is the South Yorkshire

practice at Penistone. When the yule log was burnt on Christmas eve

the tire was not allowed to go out during the night, and in the morning
whatever burning ashes were left in the grate were cai-ef ully collected and

taken down into the cellar and put under the ' milk benk ' [stone bench

where the milk vessels stood]. These ashes were supposed to ' keep the

witch away ' during the following year and bring good luck to the house ;
they were kept for years, forming a great pile in the cellar, and were not
allowed to bo taken away.^ Although in tliis example we for the first time

lose the element of annual renewal which has hitherto been present in all

the examples, it is remarkable that other important elements remain. Not

only do we get here the symbolism of continued life in the burning from

Christmas eve to Christmas morn, but in the sacred character of the ashes

preserved from year to year; and once again the connection of the house-

fire with the prosperity of the family is contained in the survival. In

Derbyshire exactly the same custom obtains, but it has reached its last

stage of decline, as it is not in an absolute form, but only permissive. If
the yule log is not burnt away on Christmas eve, the ashes or embers must

on no account be taken out of the house.''

    Next we note some customs where the Christmas log is kept alight

during the whole season of Christmas and New Year, and the continuity

of life in the fii'e is expressly made a solemn act of ritual, while the

element of annual renewal has almost, if not entirely, disappeared. In

Shropshire, half a century ago, the scene of lighting the hearth-fire

on Christmas eve to continue burning throughout the Christmas season

might have been witnessed in the hill country, from Clunbury and Worthen

Ato Pulverbatch and Pontesbury.  great trunk of seasoned oak, holly,

yew, or crabtree was drawn by horses to the house door, and thence by the

aid of rollers and levers placed at the back of the wide open hearth. The

embers were raked up to it every night, and it was carefully tended that

it might not go out during the whole season, during which time no light

might either be struck, given, or borrowed.'' On all fours with the other

yule log and the Christmas candle, and it is possible that we have here the meeting of
two intiucnces, northern and. southern, upon the waning archaism of the Christmas

festival.

examples, as to the sacred character of the house-fire during the Christmas

or New Year season, this example emphasises one important particular,

namely, thattheunluck of giving out a light includes the prohibition against

receiving a light or making a light. Clearly, therefore, we have here

symbolised in very direct form the continuous life of the New Year's house-

fire during the season which carries it on from the old year into the new.
In Warwickshire the Christmas block was not to be entirely reduced to
ashes until the end of the twelve days of Christmas.'

    The limitation of continuous burning through New Year's eve and

morn has now to be considered as the last of this group, symbolising

that the house-fire was carried on from one year to another. In
Lancashire if any householder's fire does not burn through the night

of New Year's eve it betokens bad luck through the ensuing year ; and if

any one allow another to take a live coal, or to light a candle, on that
eve, the bad luck extends to the grantor.^ In the border counties it is

deemed highly unlucky to let the fire out on New Year's eve, All-

Halloween, Midsummer eve, and Christmas eve, and no one will on the
following morning give out a light lest he should give away his luck for

the season.^

     In the Northumberland example, quoted above, it was seen how the
more modern yule candle was apparently displacing the archaic yule log.

This provides the necessaiy connecting link to a group of customs where

the burning of a candle or lamp all night on Chi'istmas or New Year's

 eve appears as the sole remaining form of the survival. That this custom
is a direct and genuine descendant from the house- fire can be proved by
the fortunate preservation of the ' missing link ' evidence between it and
 the Northumberland type. This comes from Lyiiie Regis, where the
 wood ashes of the family were formerly sold throughout the year as they

 were made, the person who purchased them being obliged to send as a
 present on Candlemas day a large candle. This candle was lighted in
 the evening, and only upon its self-extinction did the family retire to

 rest.'' I think this explains the significance of the bui-ning candle

 in connection with the survival of the house-fire cult ; for the trans-

ference fi'om Christmas or New Yeai's eve to Candlemas Day is not a

 serious flaw in the argument. I pass, then, to the more general form of
 keeping a burning candle all night on certain sacred anniversaries. In
 Yorkshire it was believed that unless this was done on Christmas eve
 there would be a death in thehouse.'' In Scotland candles of a particular
 kind were made for Christmas Day, and each candle must be so large as to
 burn from the time of its being lighted till the day be done ; if it did not,
 the circumstance would be an omen of ill-luck to the family for the
 ensuing year. In some parts the candle is not allowed to burn out, but
 is extinguished and carefully locked up in a chest, in order to be burnt

 out at the owner's date-wake."

      The third form of this particular phase of the cult of the house-

     · Dyer's Popular Customs, p. 56. There is also the case of Dublin where, because
the Ma3'-day fires were prohibited, the people fix a bush in the middle of the street
and stick it full of lighted candles (^Gent. Mag. 1791, p. 428),

     ^ Jamieson, Dictionary, s.v. ' Yule.'
     ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 647

fire does not assume many variations. It will be remembered that

the prohibition against giving out fire included, in the Shropshire
example, the prohibition against receiving it or creating it ; and this
significant inclusion of three definite forms for lighting the house-fire

from within the house appears to suggest that continuation of the house-
fire was symbolised. Further down, however, this symbolisation is re-
duced to very simple limits ; but simple as they are they are connected

directly with the whole system of the house-fire cult. ' No fire must on
any account be taken out of the house between Christmas eve and New

Year's eve,' is the Derbyshire survival ; ' and perhaps, as it carries the

practice over a period longer than a particular day, it may be taken as

the most archaic. In Scotland people would not allow a coal to be

carried out of their house to that of a neighbour on Christmas Day, New

Year's Day, Handsel Monday, and Rood Day, the reason being that it
might be employed for the purpose of witchcraft.- Here again we have
not a continuous period bub certain selected sacred days. In North-

umberland, however, although the ceremonial of the Christmas log

obtains, as we have already noted, in a somewhat degraded form, it is

only on New Year's Day that the prohibition against giving out fire

obtains.^ In the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, the people will not
allow any fire to be taken out of their houses on Old Christmas

Day.^

     In Herefordshire we meet with the extreme divergent form of this cus-
tom, showing the direction of its decline into mere superstition. On Old
Christmas Day and during the twelve days no person must borrow fire,
but they may purchase it with some trifle or other, for instance a pin.-^

         4. The House-Jire Cult continued : Customs associated with the
                                              Household Fire.

     In the most perfect examples of the village-fire ceremonial certain
elements were noted to be associated with the formal attribute of the fire

-- --perpetual life which, whether in their primary forms or in divergence

from the primary form, were ascertained to contain fragments of ritual or
primitive associations. Such associations cannot be claimed for the survi-
vals of the house-fire in its formal attribute of continuous life, because
the observers of examples of continuous life in the house-fire have not
extended their work to gather together what the peasantry thought

about, or how they treated the fire thus guarded from extinction. There
are, however, one or two associated customs which have been noted, and
these are of some importance. On the other hand there is another body
of customs, drawn altogether from another set of examples, generally
from another part of the country, which can only be explained by re-
ferring their origin to the same system of fire customs as those which

stamp the village-fire and the house-fii-es lighted therefrom.

    We will note, first, the few actually associated customs. In Lewis

after the house-fire has been newly kindled from the village-fire, ' a pot
full of water is quickly set on it and afterwards sprinkled upon the
people infected with the plague or upon the cattle that have the murrain.*

Pire is also carried 'round about women before they are churched after

child-bearing, and it is used likewise about children until they be christ-
ened, both which are performed in the morning and at night ... as an
effectual means to preserve both the mother and the infant from the

power of evil spirits who are ready at such times to do mischief and
sometimes carry away the infant.' ' In the Western Isles of Scotland, as
Candlemas Day comes round, the mistress and servants of each family,

taking a sheaf of oats, dress it up in woman's apparel, and after putting
it in a large basket, beside which a wooden club is placed, they cry three
times, ' Briid is come, Briid is welcome.' This they do just before going
to bed, and as soon as they rise in the morning they look among the ashes,
expecting to see the impression of Briid's club therfe, which if they do, they
reckon it a true presage of a good crop and prosperous year.'^ The same

conception is more generally expressed in the Manx custom. In many of

tlie upland cottages it is customary for the housewife, after raking the fire
for the night, and just before stepping into bed, to spread the ashes smooth
over the Hoor with the tongs, in the hope of finding in them, next morning,
the trace of a foot. Should the toes of this ominous print point towards

the door, then it is believed a member of the family will die in the course

of the year ; but should the heel of the fairy foot point in that direction,
then it is firmly believed that the family will be augmented within the
same period.^

      I will next proceed to formulate the various elements which distinguish
the ceremonies of the house-fire in those examples which are unconnected
with any of the evidence previously dealt with

      That the hearth is the residence of a house-spirit is to be illustrated

by many scraps of our fairy mythology. In a seventeenth-century work
quoted by Brand, we read ' Doth not the warm zeal of an Englishman's

devotion (who was ever observed to contend most stifly pro aris et focis)

make him maintain and defend the sacred hearth, as the sanctuary and

chief place of residence of the tutelary lares and household gods, and the
only court where the lady fairies convene to dance and revel ? ' (ii. 504).
Maids are punished by the fairies (fairies being the generic folklore title
for any form of spirit) for untidy household habits, and particularly for
not attending properly to the hearth. Thus in the old ballad of ' Robin

Goodfellow ' it is said :

                      ' Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths uiiswcpt.
                         There pinch the maids as blue as bilbery.'

swept, and a vessel of water placed for their use before the family retire

setting them down make a courtesie to each.' Drayton, in the ' Nymphidia,'

records a piece of genuine traditional folklore in the following lines :

                            ' Hence shadows, seeming idle shapes
                              Of little friskina: Elves and Apes,
                            To earth do make their wanton scapes,
                                 As hope of pastime hastes them
                             Which maids think on the hearth they see

                         When fires well near consumed be,

                               These dancing haves by two and three,
                                     Just as their fancy casts them.'

The same idea is given by Reginald Scott. ' Indeed, your grandam's

maids were wont to set a bowl of milk before him (Incubus) and his

cousin Eobin Goodfellow, for grinding of malt or mustard, and sweeping

the house at midnight.' ^ Not above forty or fifty years ago, says Brand,

in his ' Description of Orkney, Zetland, itc.,' almost every family had a

' Brownie, or evil spirit, so called, who served them, to whom they gave a

sacrifice for its service ; as when they churned their milk they took a part

thereof, and sprinkled every corner of the house with it for Brownie's

use ; likewise when they brewed they had a stone, which they called

Brownie's stone, wherein there was a little hole into which they poured

Wesome wort for a sacrifice to Brownie.' ^  get a glimpse of the same

living belief in the hearth-spirit in Ireland. Among the Irish the expres-

sion ' the breaking of cinders ' means to charge and confirm guilt on a

man at his own hearth, so that his fire, which represents his honour, is

broken up into cinders. The trampling of a man's cinders was one of the

greatest insults which could be offered to him, as it conveyed the idea of

guilt, and not only on the individual himself, but also on his family and

household.^

    At Fermanagh, a peculiar manner of cursing, rapidly dying out, is
usually fulminated by tenants who suppose themselves to be in danger of

wrongful eviction. The 'plaintiff' collects from the surrounding fields as

many small boulders as will fill the principal hearth of the holding he is
being compelled to surrender. These he piles in the manner of turf sods

arranged for firing, and then, kneeling down, prays that until that heap burns

may every kind of bad luck and misfortune attend the landlord and his

family to untold generations. Rising, he takes the stones in armfuls and
hurls them here and there in loch, pool, boghole or stream, so that by no

possibility could the collection be recovered.'*

    From Cornwall I have obtained a note of a custom which is, to all

intents and purposes, a hearth sacrifice. The practice of resorting to the
hearth, and touching the cravel (the mantle-stone across the head of an

open chimney) with the forehead, and casting into the fire a handful of
dry grass, or anything picked up that will burn, is regarded as the most

effectual means of averting any impending evils of a mysterious nature.''

These are the general superstitions which indicate a peculiar set of

beliefs attaching to the domestic hearth in places where it is no longer

specific ceremonials of marriage and birth. In north-east Scotland the

bride was led straight to the hearth, and into her hands were put the tongs,

with which she made up the fire. The besom was at times substituted for

the tongs, when she swept the hearth. The crook was then swung three

times round her head, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

and with the prayer, ' May the Almichty mack this umman a gueedwife.'

The last act of her installation as ' gueedwife ' was leading her to the gir-

nal or mehl-boivie, and pressing her hand into the meal as far as possible.

This last action, it was believed, secured in all time coming abundance

of the stafi" of life in the household. ' Again, when the bride is entering

her future home, two of her female friends meet her at the door, the

one bearing a towel or napkin, and the other a dish filled with various

kinds of bread. The towel or napkin is spread over her head, and the

bread is then poured over her. It is gathered up by the children who

have collected round the door. In former times the bride was then led up

to the hearth, and, after the fire had been scattered, the tongs Avere put

into her hand, and she made it up.-

In Scotland, according to Mr. Gregor's account, on the birth of the

child the mother and offspring were sained, a ceremony which was done

Ain the following manner : fir-candle was lighted and carried three times

round the bed, if it was in a position to allow of this being done, and if

this could not be done, it was whirled three times round their heads ; a

Bible and bread and cheese, or a Bible and a biscuit, were placed under

the pillow, and the words were repeated, ' May the Almichty debar a' ill
frae this umman, an be aboot ir, an bliss ir an ir bairn.' When the biscuit

or the bread and cheese had served their purpose, they were distributed

among the unmarried friends and acquaintances, to be placed under their

pillows to evoke dreams. Among some of the fishing population a fir-

candle or a basket containing bread and cheese was placed on the bed to

keep the fairies at a distance.^ Dalyell records the following curious

custom : ' The child put on a cloth spread over a basket containing pro-

--visions was conveyed thrice round the crook of the chimney ' · thus pre-

serving the proximity of fire. Pennant describes a christening feast in

the Highlands, wherein the father placed a basket of food across the fire,

and handed the infant three times over the food and flame. '^

In West Galway we meet with the curious notion that no fire must be

removed out of a house in which a child is born until the mother is up

and well.''

The mothers of Scotland are much afraid of the household fairy who

changes the new-born babe                                                                                                         and  the  question  is  put  to the  test by  an

appeal to the house-fire. Mr. Gregor says the hearth was piled with peat,

and when the fire was at its strength, the suspected changeling was placed

in front of it and as near as possible nob to be scorched, or it was sus-

pended in a basket over the fire. If it was a ' changeling child ' it made

its escape by the lum, throwing back words of scorn as it disappeared. '^

piece of a branch of a hazel tree, and into this basket the suspected

changeling was laid. Careful watch was kept till it screamed. If it

screamed it was a changeling, and it was held fast to prevent its escape.

In Scotland we meet with the significant extinction of fire, on the

occasion of a death, Pennant stating, in his ' Tour in Scotland : ' ' All

Howfire is extinguished where a corpse is kept.'  clearly fire is repre-

sented at death is shown, I think, by the widespread custom of the use

of torches and lights while the body is lying in the house, a custom that

is lengthily described by Brand. ^

     There is one other instance of the special use of the hearth-fire

which I must mention before passing on. Mr. Hunt I'elates a story

in his ' Popular Romances of the West of England ' ^ which well intro-

duces the subject. ' The child of a miner who had been suffering from a

disease, and had been sent on several occasions to the doctor without

any good resulting, was one day discovered by the father to be "over-

looked." The gossips of the parish had for some time insisted upon the

fact that the child had been ill-wished, and that she would never be

better until "the spell was taken off her." It was then formally an-

nounced that the girl could never recover unless three burning sticks were

taken from the hearth of the " overlooker," and the child was made to

walk three times over them when they were laid across on the ground,

and then quench the fire with water.'

                           5. Comparison with Primitive Custom.

     This survey, by analysis and classification, of the fire customs sur-
viving in Britain has been kept clear of any terminology which is not
actually justified by the circumstances of each individual example or
group of examples. But it cannot have escaped notice that the facts
which have been quoted all tend in one direction, namely to the con-
nection of the fire customs with the family, and through the family to
some unit larger than the family, represented by the modern village in a
geographical sense and by a group of common descendants in a personal

sense.

     But if we are justified in using such significant terminology as this,
we have already made the first step towards the identification of these
survivals as the remnants of a system of tire-worship belonging to some
one or other of the early tribes who conquered Britain before they had

conformed to the Christian religion ; for I shall assert that the con-
nection between the modern village-fire and the house-fire is due to the
survival in traditional custom of the ancient connection between the

tribal fire and the family or clan fire. When, therefore, in addition to
this essential feature of the connection between the village-fire and the
house-fire, an examination of the details of both village-fire customs and

house-fire customs has revealed certain significant indications of the once
sacred character of these fires, of ceremonies which recall almost the

                            ' Gregor, op. cit. p. 9.

formula of a lost religious rite, and of usages which go back to pre-

--historic civilisation for their only possible explanation when it has been

found that these conceptions cluster round the burning embers of the
modern fire, the case for deciding that the whole group of evidence
belongs to the ancient tribal fire cult is provisionally at all events amply

made out, and there only remains the work of comparison with the

tribal fire cult of a primitive people to complete the proof.
      Let us, however, first note whither this conclusion almost insensibly

leads us. Nearly every writer on this subject has, it seems to me,

begun at the wrong end. He has commenced with the few references to

the god Bel, and has built up a theory of sacrifice and worship which
has little or no evidence in its favour in the examples which have been

examined in the previous pages. And in thus accentuating the re-

ligious element of these rites he has left wholly untouched the one

clue to their origin, namely, the social organisation of the people who

performed them. It is always useless to discuss early religions with-
out taking count of the social organism of which the religion is
only a portion. Early peoples did not differentiate, as modern peoples
do, between the various elements of their culture ; all the parts were
closely interwoven, and cannot be divorced from each other even for

the purpose of a separate analysis. To have established that these fire
customs are intimately connected with a social unit is to connect them
with a tribal religion and tribal society, and to limit their interpretation
and meaning by what is conveyed by the term tribal. That term is
applicable to the conditions of both the Celtic and Teutonic settlers of
this country ; and it is to these peoples, therefore, branches of the Aryan-
speaking peoples, that we must provisionally at all events allot that
portion of the tribal system which has been revealed by the customs
already examined. They reveal the solemn rekindling of the tribal fire
at least once a year, and the carrying of the sacred fiame therefrom to
the fire of the household, as the two essential details of the cult ; and
the several very significant rites which accompany these details are all
illustrative of the tribal conditions to which the whole ceremonial

 belongs.

      Having ascertained all there is to be deduced from the several elements
preserved in the customs, there is one very important matter finally to be

--considered from an element which does not appear in the customs I mean

 the entire absence of anything like a priestly caste as the necessary
 performers of the sacred rites ; and the question is : Is this absence due to
the degradation of the modern forms in survival, or is it due to the original
 conditions from which the survivals have descended 1 This is one of the
 questions not to be answered from the study of survivals, but which can

 only be deferred until the conclusions to be drawn from comparison with

 primitive rites are before us.

    We will now turn, for confirmation of these views, to the comparison

 of the survivals of the British tribal fire cult with the system belonging to

 the early Aryan tribes elsewhere than in Britain.
      The points of analogy are numerous and important enough to establish

 the intimate connection between the British and non-British evidence.
 But in one very important particular, just where it might be expected
 perhaps that the analogy of the modern survival to the early Aryan
 survival would not obtain, the conclusions drawn are very considerably
ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 653

strengthened. If the house-fire was in itself continuously kept up as

a sacred duty, how is it that the time arrives for it to be put out and

relighted from the tribal fire ? Is this indeed a primitive characteristic,
or is it a form of decay into which the survival has fallen ? This is an

important question, because if it has to be answered in the latter direction

the answer would tell against the  general  evidence of  which  it is  a part
                                                                                                      ;

but if it can be answered in the first sense, namely, that it is a primitive

characteristic, it strengthens the position immeasurably.

     The reasons for renewing the house-fire once a year at a solemn tribal
festival are indeed not far to seek. Its employment in daily life, more
particularly by its application to industrial purposes, made fire unhallowed

according to the notions of the ancient Iranians ; and hence it had to be

purified from time to time, and to be brought back to the ' lawful place,'
the holy fire altar of the community, from whence a fresh brand was

obtained wherewith to revive the fire of the home hearth. ' This explanation

is, in fact, drawn from the early Avesta religion, and it not only accounts
for the fire cult belonging to that religion, but also for customs among

Greeks and Germans. There can be no harm, therefore, in using it to

explain some of the peasant customs in Britain. It suggests that the

annual or periodical extinction and renewal of the house-fire and the

continuity of it from the time of its renewal to the time of its extinction
are primary forms of survivals of the sacred hearth-fire in modern peasant

custom. One other detail I must mention. It will be remembered that
I laid special emphasis upon the fact that animals and human beings being

made to ' pass through fire ' did not tell for evidence of sacrifice, but for

evidence of contact with some sacred element in the fire. This, too, is con-

firmed by the tribal fire cult of the Iranians : ' From the smoke and the

flame of fire it was believed that the will of the deity could be recognised.

His crackling flame was the means whereby he spoke to men.' -

I shall not elaborate further on this occasion the parallels between the

fire customs of Britain, which I have here classified and analysed, and the

fire customs of the primitive Aryan tribes. But I will refer to Mr. J. G.

Frazer's admirable paper on ' The Prytaneum, the Temple of Vesta,

the Vestals, Perpetual Fires,' in the 'Journal of Philology,' vol. xiv.

pp. 145-172, as the parallel evidence in Greek belief-- evidence so mar-

shalled and arranged as to make it nearly unnecessary to attempt an

exhaustive comparison, especially on an occasion like the present, when

detail is not so needed as general principles. Suffice it to say, then, that

the scattered remnants of fire customs which appear in our folklore can

be restored by the comparative method, only possible when we have duly

classified and analysed the customs, as a part of the early tribal system of

organisation-- a system, be it remembered, which governed every detail of

early life, political, religious, and social, and which has left its marks on

the map of Britain and on the early constitutional history of our people.

The importance of this conclusion to folklore is that it enables us to

proceed from the identification of tribal custom and belief to the identifi-

cation of tribes : from the identification of tribes to the identification of

races ; and the importance of it to history is that it gives to historical

<lata a large body of evidence not otherwise obtainable.

        6. The Tribal System from the Evidence of Early Eecords.

The importance of studying the details of the tribal organisation in

the early development of Aryan-speaking peoples has only been tardily

recognised by historians. The material for it is not in fact to be found in

the records, and it is only the recent comparative study of institutions

which has revealed the tribal organisation as the basis of the early economic

and social condition, and has enabled the student of records to understand

passages that once passed for corrupted or obsolete texts not to be under-

stood easily by modern commentators. From early records the tribe is

seen very dimly ; from the comparative study of legal institutions it is

seen more clearly in so far as its own construction and position are con-

cerned, less clearly when attempted to be identified in any particular

country of Europe whose history has flowed on into the existing civili-

sation. Probably in Britain these two conditions are exemplified more

sharply than elsewhere, the one in the Celtic divisions of the country, the

other in the Teutonic.

     The Celtic tribe can be studied from the early MSS. of Scotland, Wales,

and Ireland ; and the fascination of Celtic studies generally has caused
a considerable amount of very valuable research. The Teutonic tribe is

less observable from the laws, the poems, and the charters which have

come down from early English times ; and research into this branch of our
history has concerned itself more with the origins of existiiig institutions

than with the relics of lost institutions. It is taken for granted that some
sort of tribal system existed ; but what has become of it, and how it has
stamped itself upon the history of the people, have never been shown.

The records have been studied through a long line of eminent scholars,

of which the names of Stubbs, Freeman, Kemble, Elton, Skene, Maine,

and Seebohm, stand out conspicuously. Bishop Stubbs contents himself

with a masterly sketch in brief of the arrival of the first tribes of English-

men, stating it as the starting-point of his investigations that ' the invaders

come in families and kindreds and in the full organisation of their tribes
. . . the tribe was as complete when it had removed to Kent as when

it stayed in Jutland : the magistrate was the ruler of the tribe, not of the

soil ;  the  divisions  were  those of  the folk  and  the host,  not of  the land
                                                                                                        ;

the laws were the usages of the nation, not of the territory.' ' Cleai-ly as

this is put, it does not entirely shake off the influence of Kemble and of

Freeman, neither of whom quite got clear of the terminology of a territorial

constitution. Mr. Elton breaks new ground and deals with some of the

anthropological evidence which was ignored by his predecessors ; but the
evidence of the tribe is lost in his accumulations of the fragments of

primitive custom and belief. Mr. Skene deals rather with the tribes

themselves than with the tribal organisation under which they lived.

And thus it is only from Sir Henry Maine and Mr. Seebohm that the

tribal life of the British peoples receives any light ; the former deals with
it from the juridical side, and the latter from the economical. It is

therefore obvious that the history of the tribal constitution is not exhausted

by these authorities ; and Mr. Seebohm very grudgingly allows that folklore

may be the means of restoring some of the lost evidence of the tribal

system which is not supplied from the records.^

     3. The blood-tie is reckoned by fatherhood, with power to reckon

8. Sonship is the essential factor of the tribal marriage system.

    The tribe as known to traditional custom and belief contains the germs
of all this and something more, namely, the cement which bound tribesmen

--together and formed them into an inseparable group the cement of a

tribal religion which had its seat in the fire of the tribe and the clan.

                        7. Conclusion.

I have stated above that, after the work of classification and compari-

son is completed for any one custom, there are further conditions before

the first results of comparison can be properly and finally accepted. One

of these conditions imposes the necessity for proving that the fire customs

which have by the application of the comparative method been identified

with the fire customs of the early tribal system of Aryan peoples shall,

upon examination, be found to be associated with other customs which,

upon classification and comparison, can be identified with the Aryan

inhabitants of these islands. This work is, of course, a matter of time

and further research ; and we can only accept the conclusion I have drawn

in this report as preliminary to the final results whenever they be obtained.

In the meantime, justification for this conclusion is derived from the

--evidence of the records upon the tribal system evidence which is com-

plementary to that derived from traditional custom, I have, however,

also prepared a diagram to show how this part of the investigation may

be most readily proved. I first of all mark on a map of Britain the

places where the fire customs obtain. I then join these places together

by a straight line, and, withdrawing from this result all reference to the

inap which formed the basis of it, a geometrical figure of a certain shape

in outline and a certain shape in internal detail is obtained. This figure is
Weof great importance.
                        may call it, for practical use, ' the ethnological

test-figure.' Upon working out other groups of customs the process

would be to see how far the same figure is reproduced, and how far one

figure of a series differs from other figures, whether in simply being

incomplete or whether in radical form. I have not been able, in the time at

my disposal, to bring forward a test case, that is, another custom of Aryan

origin to equate with the fire custom, but from some provisional studies I

am satisfied that the test-figure produced by the fire customs will be pro-

--duced by other customs similarly dealt with. In the meantime there is

the important question to ask Are there customs which will not produce

 the test-figure ? For the purpose of answering this I have compared
 roughly the important group of customs relating to water- worship.

     Now I have stated in my 'Ethnology in Folklore' reasons for consider-

 ing water-worship customs to be non- Aryan in origin, to belong, therefore,
 to the pre-Celtic people of these islands ; and it is remarkable that the

 'ethnological test- figure ' produced from the water customs differs radi-
cally from that produced by the fire customs. I suggest, therefore, that

in this intei-esting fact we have provisionally a proof of the value of
this method of studying the ethnological basis of folklore.

The fifth season of the Exploration of the Lake or Marsh Village near

yielded results of more than ordinary interest and importance. The
recent dry weather has been most favourable for deep digging, the ground
being examined in many places to the depth of nine or ten feet ; a depth
not admissible in former seasons owing to flooding by rain, or the rapid
percolation of water from the surrounding peat. Since presenting this
report at Ipswich the following work has been carried out. The remaining
500 feet of the palisading bordering the village has been traced, and the
peat examined immediately contiguous and outside it for the width of
from 10 to 40 feet. The circumference of the village has now been
completely explored, and an accurate and detailed plan of it made.
Besides this eight more dwelling mounds have been examined, together
with the spaces of ground between and around them. The portions of
the border palisading remaining over from last year and exposed this
season were situate at the north and south sides of the settlement, and at
both places it was found to be stronger and in a better state of pre-
servation than elsewhere. In many places, but more especially at the
south part of the border, the horizontal pieces of timber and trunks
of trees, although much displaced and decayed, still formed a platform
3 feet thick ; and the vertical palisading posts bordering this frequently
formed a line three or four abreast.

     Near the north edge of the village some large mortised oak beams
were found in situ, and fixed by their original piles. Other beams of the
same kind were discovered among the timber forming the substructure of

an adjacent dwelling mound, evidently not in their original position. As

a rule, where the palisading was strongest, the peat outside contained
a larger amount of debris, and the signs of occupation were dug up
at a greater depth than elsewhere.

     With regard to tlie construction of the dwellings, an important

discovery of wattle work was made early in the season. Among the
wood and debris underlying the clay of a dwelling mound three hurdles

were uncovered ; the more complete one measured 6 feet 3 inches high
by 10 feet 6 inches wide, with an average space between the upright
posts of 5 inches. In close proximity to the hurdles was a beam of oak,
having small mortise holes arranged along one side parallel to the edge

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

the distance between the holes exactly tallied with the spaces between the

hurdle posts. From the way the under surface of the beam was cut

and notched, it was evident that it had been placed at right angles to a
Wesimilar piece of timber.
                                    have here distinct proof that some of

the dwellings were not angular, and that the walls were about G feet in

lieight.

With reference to th6 eight dwelling mounds examined, one especially

needs mentioning, although all have yielded their various points of

interest. The mound in question was one of the largest in the field, and

was found to be composed of nine layers of clay or floors, with a total

thickness of 6 feet, the substructure being 3 feet in depth. At or near the

centre    seven  superimposed  hearths  were  unearthed                                           the two uppermost
                                                                                               ;

were constructed of stone, the rest being composed either of gravel

or baked clay. The fifth hearth made of clay was the most remarkable

one of the series, its shape was, roughly speaking, a square of

5 feet 3 inches with  the  corners  rounded                               it  was  raised         4  inches  above
                                                                       ;

the surrounding Hoor level, and its edges bevelled off ; the surface was

smooth and flat and covered with an impressed decoration of circles

measuring 5| inches in diameter, arranged in rows parallel to the edges.

In the clay floor apparently corresponding to hearth No. 4, a basin shaped

hollow was found measuring 2 feet in diameter and 9 inches deep, with

the sides and base baked hard ; with the exception of a little fire ash,

it contained nothing of importance. Near the edge of No. 3 hearth a

circular hole was discovered 6 inches in diameter and about 9 inches

deep, filled with charcoal and fire ash. There was also a somewhat simi-

lar hole near hearth No. 5, but of larger size. The dwelling correspond-

ing to the lowest floor had evidently been destroyed with fire, as shown

by the quantity of baked clay bearing wattle, timber, and crevice marks,,

and also by the pieces of charred timber. Passing now to the smaller

--objects, the following may be mentioned.
      Wood. The handle of a quern.

Two blocks, probably the sockets for the pivots of a door.

     Several lathe-turned wheel spokes and part of an axle box similar
in shape to the piece discovered and described last year.

   A large ladle quite complete, and parts of two smaller ones.

     Portions of two small tubs cut from the solid, one being decorated"
with two bands of incised herring-bone pattern.

      Part of a large basin-shaped bowl cut from the solid, with a grooved
rim intended for holding the projecting moulding of a cover ; the outer
surface of the fragment is ornamented with an incised circular design.

     Amongst other things made of wood may be noticed fragments of'

several stave-made tubs or cups, j^ieces of awl and spade handles, a
mallet, part of a basket, and fragments of a thin piece of wood fifteen
inches long by three inches wide, perforated with small holes at the
ends and along one ridge, and ornamented on one side with a triangular-

design.

  --Pottery. As in former seasons quantities of both wheel- and liand-

made pottery have been met with, and include six vessels quite perfect ;
many others, although found in fragments, will be complete when recon-

structed. Several new designs of ornamented pottery have been met with,

this season.

  --Flint. Some well-made scrapers and a few cores and flakes.

     <S'<one.-- Spindle whorls, whetstones, and three circular and saddle-
shaped querns.

   A saw.
   A gouge.

    And a billhook, all of which were found intact with wooden handles.

    Part of a second billhook.

    A stay or loop.
    A roughly semicircular-shaped implement fifteen inches long, pointed

out and bent at one end for fixing in a handle.

    A bar of iron eighteen inches long.

                                                   spindle whorl, a fishing-net weight or plummet.
     --Kimeridge Shale. Fragments of several armlets and rings.
     --Glass. Three complete blue beads.
    --Horn. More than thirty pieces of cut horn, including
                                                                                                                                                                                               ferrules

--Ahaftings, handles, cheek pieces, and eight long-handled weaving combs.
     Worked Bone.                                     number of implements, among them being needles,

gouges, polishing bones, and twenty or more perforated metacarpal sheep

bones.

  --Baked Clay other tJian Pottery. Portions of several large triangular

blocks or loom weights, spindle whorls, sling pellets, and part of a small

three-cornered crucible.

   --Human Bones. The following list of human remains have been found

at various parts of the excavation this season :

   A1. complete adult skull, badly cut in the occipital region.

     2. Three more or less complete skeletons of very young children ; one

was found on the floor of a dwelling two feet from the hearth.

    3. An adult skull in fragments, and portions of the lower extremities

belonging to the same body.

   --4. Several fragments from other bodies one of these, a clavicle, bears

distinct traces of having been gnawed by a dog.

     Bones of animals have been as abundant as formerly. Geological and

botanical specimens have been collected and carefully preserved for ex-

amination                                          among the latter is  a  sack  full of sloe, wild plum stones, and
                                                ;

other seeds, found together within the space of a few feet among the

debris outside the palisading.

     Shallow test borings have been made through the peat at various

parts of the village, and in the surrounding fields. The greatest depth

of   peat  met with                                   has been sixteen feet                                                                                              underlying  it  is a  layer  of  soft
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

blue clay more than six feet thick, The borings are being extended at

intervals of 100 yards in a line north and south of the village between

the raised lands of Glastonbury and Godney. Of the original sixty-five
dwelling mounds there still remain twenty- six unopened ; these, together
with the spaces of ground around them and near the centre of the village,

representing more than one-third of the total area of the settlement, await

future e.xamination. Some of the more recent discoveries are being

exhibited during the meeting of the Association.

 Linguistic and Anthropoloriieal GJoaracteristics of the North Dravidian

   -- --and Kolarian Iidces. the Urdnws. Report of the Committee^ con-

     sisting of Mr. E. Sidney Hartland (Chairman), Mr. Hugh

      Rayniurd, juu. (Secretary), Professor A. C. Haddon, and Mr.
      J. L. Myres.

 This Committee was appointed to report upon the materials accumulated

by Mr. Hugh Raynbird, jun., during several years' residence among the

 JJriinios and other non- Aryan races of Chui!ia Nagpiir. The languages
of these races are almost unknown to philology. Di-. Oscar Flex has
published an elementary introduction to JJrknw, and there are grammars
and vocabularies of an elementary character in some of the Kolarian
dialects, but these languages have not yet been treated scientifically or
fully. Mr. Raynbird has collected, including variants, more than 800
folk-tales, 4,000 folk-songs, many riddles, proverbs, and phrases ; has
compiled vocabularies, and begun a systematic JJr-hiiv grammar. His
materials are already partially, and will, it is hoped, be eventually wholly,
deposited with the Royal Asiatic Society, where they will be accesr.ible to
specialists. Mr. Raynbird is now in England, but is prevented by his

circumstances from devoting his time to the elaboration of his materials.

He hopes eventually to be enabled to return to India to resume his

investigations.

     The Committee have conferred with Mr. Raynbird, have examined
some part of his materials, and have assisted him to prepare some part of
them for publication ; a representative selection from them is appended,
consisting of three tales which illustrate points in the cosmology, historical
traditions and customs of the JJrkmus, Avith Mr. Raynbird's explanatory

notes.

     As the work of translation, transcription, and indexing so large a mass
of quite new and unfamiliar data is necessarily slow and laborious, the

Committee ask to be re-appointed, and hope at the end of the coming
year to be in a position to recommend the Association to take effective

action in the matter.

                                  APPENDIX.

                                I. The Sun and the Moon.

    This tale was first of all told to me in English by a Christian Uraon
named Elias Bochcho whilst we were out for a walk together. As soon as
we got home he wrote it down for me in English. I then asked him if he
could write it down in the Uraon language, and he did so.

    He was at that time a schoolmaster in the S.P.G. Mission school at
Ranchi. He could speak and write High Hindi and the dialect of Eastern
Hindi spoken in Chutia Nagpur. He was well acquainted with both the
Roman and Devanagri characters. I taught him Church history, Euclid,

and Algebra, and he was the most intelligent specimen of his race I have
met with.

    He said that the tale was told him by his mother. She belonged to a
                                                                            uu 2

small village named Chipra, which lies six miles to the west of Ranchi,
the chief town in the wild and hilly district of Chutia Nagpur. This is
the most western part of Bengal, and borders on the Central Provinces of
India. This old woman was entirely uneducated. She only understood
the Uraon language and perhaps a little rustic Hindi. She had very little

idea of civilisation.

     There are internal evidences of matter, idioms, and words in the tale

itself which seem to me to stamp it as a genuine Uraon folk tale and not
made up by the Christian narrator or boi'rowed from literary or Aryan

sources.

     1. Once upon a time the Moon covered up her children with a large
leaf basket, and, having boiled sweet potatoes, sat down to eat them.

     2. At that time the Sun came to her and said : ' Sister, what are you
eating 1 Give me also a little.'

     3. The Moon gave.
     4. The Sun tasted it, and asked, her : ' Sister, what is this 1
    5. The ]Moon said : ' I have boiled my children from hunger, and I am

eating them.'

     6. The Sun slunk away to his home, and boiled his children iii a very
large pot and ate them.

     7. Then the Moon uncovered her children.
     8. The Sun saw this, and he seized a bow to kill the 3Ioon with, and

chased her.

     9. Tlie Moon went and hid in a banyan tree.
     10. The Sun came up and hit the Moon, and took out a small piece.

     11. The Kunr'qars (that is, the Ui"an?rs) say that the same banyan

tree is seen in the Moon to this day.
    12. Again, they say that the Sun cut the Moon in two ; therefore the

Moon is sometimes small and sometimes large.
     13. They say there were also many children of the Sun, but if they

had remained all men would have died from the heat.

          III. The Tale of Badgo Village.

    This tale was first of all written down for me as an exercise in English
by one of my pupils, the Rev. Markas Manjan, a native Uraon pastor in
the S.P.G. Mission in Chutia Nagpur. He came originally from the

village of Dadgo. It is a remote village about twenty miles south-west of

ARanchi.  few miles south of it we begin to meet with the Uriyas, the

Aryan people who inhabit Orissa, and who speak a language closely allied

to Bengali. Markas Manjan wrote the tale first in English, but long

afterwards I got the Uraon version from him. The two versions agree in

all important particulars.

    Though Markas Manjan could write in the Roman and Deva Nagri

characters, and was a fair High Hindu and English scholar, I very much

doubt if he had ever read any tales, as his education had been for the

most part in Biblical and theological literature.

     This tale is important, as containing much undesigned evidence about

--the habits and customs of the Uraons. E.g. :

1. Division of lands.

2. Husking of rice. (Manner and locality.)

3 Two kinds of rice fields. (Upland and lowland.)
          UN LINGUISTIC AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS. 661

    4. Human sacrifice. (Compare the Meriah of the Khauds of Central

India.)

      5. Drinking of I'ice beer ; &c.

     1. Dadgo is a small village eighteen miles south-west of Ranclii.^
     2. Formerly it was a large village, but now it has been divided into
three villages, viz. Dadgo, Balandu, and Nawatoli.
     3. At first it was divided in two villages, viz. Dadgo and Nawatoli,
and the latter was quite separate from Dadgo, but the other two were

I'eckoned as one.

     4. The following tale is told about the separation of Dadgo and

Balandu.

    5. Dadgo itself was a big village, and contained many rich people.
     6. In such villages there are many young women, and they make their

Kiwri (i.e. the place where the rice is husked) outside the village.

     7. According to this custom the young women here also had made

their Kawi outside the village, just where two tamarind trees now stand

south of Markas Manjan's (the narrator's) house.

    8. Now it happened that a man called by the JJrdnivs Onc^ok, and by the

Sadans (low caste Hindus) Otanga (i.e. a man who offers human sacrifice
to his god), came by with a boy in his bag, whom he was carrying to

sacrifice.

     9. Hearing the noise made by the people he thought they were tipsy.

    10. He hung the bag on a tamarind tree, and going into a house he

asked for rice-beer.

    11. When he had taken rice-beer, then he became tipsy.

     12. Meanwhile the young women of the village came to the tamarind

tree to separate the husks from the rice.
     13. They saw the bag and heard the child cry inside the bag.
     14. They took away the child, and in place of it they put some thorny

bushes and lumps of earth.

     15. Next morning the man came to the tree and took the bag on his
back and went away on his journey.

    16. And it is said that when the thorns pricked him, he said, 'Be
quiet, little child, now we are near your mother ; ' for the man did not
know what the young women of the village had done.

     17. That little child was brought up by the chief men of the village,
and when he became a young man his marriage took place.

     18. After this the chief men of the village consulted together among

themselves about him, and settled that some portion of the land, apart
from their children, should be given to him, because he was their adopted

child.

     19. It is said that in those days there was more rain in Cliu^ia
Nagpur than nowadays, and therefore the land which is called ' chaura,'
i.e. the high land, was more fertile than the ' kudar,' i.e. the lowland.

    20. Now when the chief men of the village met to fix what part of

the village they should give to him, they chose that part M'here the soil

was least fertile, and thus they gave their adopted son the spot on which
the village of Balandu now stands.

     21. They gave half of the lands to him.
     22. This'is now more fertile than the other part.

                  ' Eanchi is the chief town of the province of Chuiia Nagpur.
          '

662 REPORT-- 1896.

     23. So Balandu is now a bigger village than Dadgo, because it has
more fertile land than Dadgo.

    24. And thus the inhabitants of Dadgo are very poor.

     25. It is now a very small village, and contains only twenty or thirty

houses.

     26. It now belongs to Jagnath Ivhutiya, who is one of the heathen

priests of Puri.

    27. He got it from the king of Chutia Nagpur.

     28. The king presented it to him when he was on pilgrimage to

Puri.

          XII. Tale of a Mouse.

This tale was told by our ayah or nurse, Elisaba, wife of Budhu. She

came originally from the village of Kachabai'i, on the south-west side of

Ranch] . She could neither read nor write, and understood very little

High Hindi, but could talk fluently in Eastern Hindi. _

    This tale was written down for- me by my wife, Asa Lak~a (' Hope

Tiger '), a Christian XJraon, who could at that time read and write in the
Devanagri character only. She has since come to England and learnt to
read and write English. She assists me in these studies.

   My wife was told this tale also by Susannah, the wife of Philip the

carpenter. Susannah is also from the village of Kachabari.

   A1. mouse had a field.

    2. He ploughed it and sowed hemp in it.

     3. In course of time the hemp grew up and blossomed.
     4. The mouse was always watching it.
    5. One day, what happened 1 Some young women, who were picking
herbs,' went into that hemp field, and were engaged picking the hemp

flowers.

Who6. At once the mouse cried out, '  myis picking  flowers 1 '

7. The young women heard him crying out and ran away.

8. Whilst they were running away, the comb of ojie of them dropped

in the field.

    9. As the mouse was going along he found the comb and took it home.

    10. When the young women had gone a little distance, they saw that

one of them had lost her comb.
     1 1 . Then she, whose comb was lost, said to the others, ' Come along,

we will go and look for my comb.'

     12. Then they all went to look for the comb, and wandered about in

the hemp-field looking for it, but could not find it.

     13. The mouse soon came forward from somewhere or othei', and said,

' What do you want in my field ?

     14. They said, ' AVe are looking for a comb give it to us if you have
                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

found it.'

    15. He said, 'Whose comb is lost? If she will live with me then I

will give it, otherwise I will not.'

    16. She said, ' I will go and live with you. Give me my comb.'

     17. Then he gave up the comb, and took her away to his home.

    18. When they arrived she would not enter his house.

     19. Then the mouse said :

    ' By ' herbs ' would be meant any kind of greens or leaves boiled to eat as a

relish with rice.

(Song)  ' Will you enter my house or not ?

         Will you remain crying ?

         Give me my hemp flower.
         Go to your parent's home.'

20. Then she entered the house, but did not want to cook the food.
21. Then he said :

(Song)  ' Will you cook or not ?

         Will you remain standing ?

         Give me my hemp flower.

         Go to your parent's home.'

22. Then she cooked the food.
23. After eating and drinking, he told her to spread a mat.

(Song)  ' Will you spread the mat or not ?

         Will you remain standing ?

         Give me my hemp flower.

         Go to your pai'ent's home.'

     24. Afterwards she spread the mat, and they lay down, to sleep.
     25. Early the next morning they both went to her parent's home.
     26. The mouse was darting about saluting every one.
     27. Whilst he was engaged saluting he fell into some hot rice-broth,
and after struggling a time he died.

       The possible Infedivity of the Oyster, and upon the Green Disease

          in Oysters. By Professor Rubert "W. Boyce, M.B., M.R.C.S.,
          and Professor W. A. Herdman, B.Sc, F.R.S., University College,

I Liverpool; being the First Report of the Committee, consisting of
          Professor W. A. Herdman {Chairman), Professor R. Boyce

            (Secretary), Mr. G. C. Bourne, and Professor C. S. Sherrington,

             appointed to report on the Elucidation of the Life Conditions of the

            Oyster under Normal and Abnormal Environment, including in the

            latter the effect of sewage matter and pathogenic organisms.

     At the last meeting of the British Association, Ipswich, 1895, we brought
      forward, as a paper ' On Oysters and Tyjshoid ' laid before Section D,

       some results based upon the artificial feeding and cultivation of oysters
       in sewage-contaminated sea-water. AVe concluded that the laying do\vn
       of oysters in localities where there was a constant change of water, by
       tidal current or otherwise, was beneficial to the health of the oyster, and
       "we surmised that by methods similar to those employed in the bassins de
       digorgement of the French ostreiculturist, where the oysters are carefully
        subjected to a natural process of cleaning, oysters previously contaminated
       with sewage could be freed of pathogenic organisms or their products
        without spoiling the oyster.

       --Nature of Present Report. The present report, which is still incom-

       plete, deals almost exclusively with the bacteriology of the oyster and the
       behaviour of the Bacillus typhosus in sea-water and in the oyster. The
       subject of the green coloration in oysters will be treated more fully in a
       subsequent report. The questions investigated are the following :

            I. The identification and difierentiation of the Bacillus typhosus and
        B. coli communis.

   We have systematically tested the majority of the chief differential

reactions upon samples of Bacillus typhosus and B. coli obtained from
numerous sources, and have in all cases found unmistakable differences
between the two bacilli.

demonstrate, there is an enormous difference between the number of

organisms appearing upon the agar incubated at the high temperature and

the simple or sea-water gelatine incubated at the low temperature. This

heat method of separation proved quite equal to, if not better than, the

carbolic acid or potassic iodide methods.

  --ExiKriments. In the first six cases examined precautions were taken

to ensure that the oysters were especially fresh ; in the other cases they
were obtained haphazard from the vai'ious shops (see table opposite).

The number of organisms taken from the stomach of the oyster which

could survive a temperature of 37° C. were comparatively small. In

a very large proportion of cases (^ to ^) the organism present was

of the presence of this coli group the identification of the B. typhostis

would be difficult in nature. "We cannot at present state whether the

coli group found in these experiments indicates sewage contamination, or

whether we are dealing with a group common in the intestine of the

oyster and in salt-water. The matter is being investigated by us. But

as bearing upon the next question we have found that the perfectly fresh

oyster contains far fewer bacteria, and that the percentage of B. coli is
much less.

cate, comparing the large number of bacilli present in the water with
those found in the alimentary tract, that the bacilli perish in the

intestine.

oyster are still under investigation, and we hope to give a fuller account of
Weit in our next report.
                          do not doubt that these oysters are in a

thoroughly healthy condition, and their colour is not due to copper or iron.

There is, however, a pale greenness (quite different in appearance from

the blue-green of the ' huitres de Marennes ') which we have met with in
some American oysters laid down in this country, and which we regard

as a disease. It is characterised by a leucocytosis in which enormous

numbers of leucocytes come out on the surface of the body, and especially

on the mantle. The green patches visible to the eye correspond to

accumulations of the leucocytes, which in mass have a green tint. These

cells are granular and amteboid. The granules do not give any dsfinite
reaction with the aniline stains, and so far we have not made out their
precise nature. Associated with the green disease we have found numerous

exceedingly small flagellate organisms both in the blood and in the green

patches, and observations so far lead us to believe that there is some
Werelationship between the two.
                                 have tried growing oysters under

various unusual conditions, including the addition to the sea-water of

fluids from alkali works, such as may enter our estuaries, in the hope of

getting some clue to the cause of this green disease, but have so far failed

to reproduce exactly in the laboratory the changes which apparently take

place in nature. Our present opinion, however, is that oysters exhibiting

this pale-green leucocytosis are in an unhealthy state, and we may add

that we find the liver in these specimens is histologically in an abnormal,

shrunken, and degenerate condition. Whether actually ' unfit for food

or not, they are at any rate in very ' poor ' condition, and have lost the

aroma and flavour of the normal healthy oyster.

     Phonograph, and on the Form of the Voice-curves made hy the

      Instrument}

1. The work of the Committee has, during the past year, been directed

to improving the method by which the curves of the phonograph may be

transcribed. The arrangement described in the 'Journal of Anatomy

and Physiology ' for July 1895 has been much improved in two respects :

(1) by driving the phonograph at a slow  rate  by a  small  electric  motor
                                                                                                ;

and (2) by adapting the recording lever, now made of aluminium, to a

new form of siphon recorder.^ In this way beautiful curves may be

obtained, amplified from 500 to 800 times, and on strips of telegraph

      The Committee are much iadebted to Lord Kelvia for encouragement during
the research. They also desire to express their obligations to Mr. Reid and to Mr.
Keen, of James White and Co , for executing the mechanical devices employed.

paper moving at such a speed that the vibrations occurring in 0'5 second
are spread over a distance of about 12 feet. The curves are thus greatly

amplified, and the following facts may be demonstrated graphically :

(1) That many instruments have a curve-form so characteristic as to

enable one by inspecting the curve to recognise the insti-ument. (2) That

the curve-forms of sounds produced by instruments giving a pure tone

are comparatively simple, while the curve-forms of instruments giving a

mixed tone (with numerous partials) are more complicated. (3) That
the curve forms of sounds produced by a band of music, or such a noise

clang as that of a boiler-maker's shop, are very complicated. (4) That if
the tone of an instrument predominates in the sound of a band, the

characteristic curve-form may be seen, modified to some extent by the

other instruments. (5) That the curve-forms indicating a gradation from

a tone of one pitch to a tone of another pitch maybe observed. (6) That

when numerous sounds, varyii^g in pitch, follow each other in rapid suc-

cession (as when a j^iece of music is quickly played), from ten to fifteen

vibrations appear to be sufficient to enable the ear to appreciate the

relative pitch of any one of the tones, or, in other words, pitch may be

appreciated by vibrations lasting only a fraction of a second. This time

cannot yet be definitely stated, as it has been found to vary from i^th to

Jjjth of a second.'

     2. The Committee has carefully studied the mechanism of the recording

2yoint in the Encjlishforni of the j)honotjraph, and they have constructed a
model which makes the matter easily understood. The original tinfoil
phonograph was so constructed that when the diaphi-agm was pressed
inwards by the condensation of the air wave, the marker made a corre-
sponding depression on the tinfoil, and when the diminution of pressure

came on, corresponding to the rarefaction of the air wave, the marker

passed away from the tinfoil. There were thus a series of marks the

deptli of each of which corresponded to the degree of pressure on the

Adiaphragm.  hasty inspection of the more complicated apparatus

in the English model might lead one to suppose that the action in it was
of the same nature, but a careful scrutiny will show that this is not the

case. By a large model made for the Committee it can be seen that,

when pressure is made on the diaphi'agm, the effect is to cause the cutting
edge of the recording gouge to be directed downwards. As the cutting
edge of the gouge is directed against the wax cylinder, and is opposed to the

rotation of the latter, it is evident that this change of the angle of the

gouge to a downward direction will cause the gouge to cut a deeper

groove into the wax cylinder. The depth of the groove, as determined by

the angular movement, is therefore a measure of the pi'essure on the glass
disk. It must be borne in mind that when no pressure is exerted on the

glass disk the marker cuts a groove. "When there is greater pressure, by

the cutting edge being placed at a larger angle with the tangent of the

curved surface of the cylinder, a deeper groove will he cut. On the other

hand, when the cutting edge is placed at a smaller angle with the tangent

of the curved surface of the cylinder a shallower groove will be ploughed

on the surface of the wax cylinder. It follows that, if the sound acting

on the wax cylinder of the phonograph be very intense, during the

increase of pressure, the groove will be deep, and during the diminution

    ' A detailed account of the investigation will appear in the Trans, of the Royal

Soc.of Edin.,\^^Q.

of pressure the groove will be shallow ; and so great may be the difierence

between the plus pressure of condensation and the minus pressure of rare-

faction that during the latter the recording point may only skim the
surface of the wax cylinder, without making any groove. This explains

an anomaly in several of the photographs taken of portions of the surface
of the wax cylinder. For example, a photograph of a portion of a record

taken of sound emitted by a full organ shows deep furrows, continued for

a considerable distance, corresponding to the long chord-like sounds of the
instrument, and these are succeeded by portions in which there is no
groove. In this case, so great has been the rebound from the state of

great pressure that the cutting edge has only slid along the surface of the

wax cylinder without cutting a groove.

     It is possible that here we have the explanation of one of the imperfec-

tions of the phonograph, or, perhaps, rather an illustration of the wrong
way of using the instrument. All who have tried the instrument must
have observed that the best effects are obtained by tones of moderate
intensity. If too weak, the tones given out by reproduction are only
imperfectly heard on account of their weak intensity, and by no system of

reinforcement or electrical relays can these be made fairly audible. On

--the other hand, if too strong, there are two risks : (1st) The intensity of

the tone may cause a jarring between the end of the wire in the loop

connecting the wire of the lever with the wire from the glass disk, and,
as this is communicated to the glass disk, a noise is produced ; and (2nd)

the intensity of the tone may be so great as to cause, during the rarefaction

of the air corresponding to the diminution of pressure, the recording

marker to come to the surface of the wax cylinder, or even to leave it

altogether. Suppose the marker just skims the surface, it will produce a
friction sound which must affect quality, and suppose the marker leaves
the surface altogether for a fraction of a second, there will be a rebound
from the glass disk (owing to the removal of pressure coming from the
marker) which is not exactly the same as the diminution of pressui-e due
to the rarefaction of the aerial wave in the immediately preceding vibration
These changes must affect quality of tone.

     3. The Committee has also been engaged on a method of recording
variations in the intensity of the sounds of the fhonofjraph. Suppose a
series of sound waves of gradually increasing intensity to act on the disk
of the phonograph, the pressure on the disk will gradually increase, and
the normal groove will be cut deeper. In this process each vibration wil.
be a little deeper than the one immediately befoi-e it, but the difference in
depth will be very small. If the increase of pressure of the note or chord
lasted more than half a second, the extent of surface covered by the
recording point during that time would be nearly 7 inches, and there
might be from 500 to 1,000 depressions in that distance. Suppose, now,
that we recorded all these little depressions, it will be evident that the
gradually increasing differences in height of the little curves would
scarcely be appreciable. The slow method of recording vibrations, there-
fore, whilst it is the method by which data can be obtained that have to
do with pitch and quality, will fail in giving us a record of variations in
intensity. This aspect of the matter came under notice at an early period
of the investigation. So far as the Committee are aware, no one has
attacked this side of the problem. Nothing is more striking in listening
to the phonograph when it is reproducing either human speech or musical
672 REPORT-- 1896.

sounds than the way in which it catches every inflection of the voice or
the slightest emphasis, diminuendo, and crescendo of the sound. This

must be due to variations of pressure. How may these variations be

recorded 1

      The most evident method is to attempt to record mechanically the
variations in an electro-magnet produced by pressures on a variable
resistance apparatus in the same circuit. The first attempt of the
Committee was to place Graham's transmitter over the glass disk of the
phonograph and to place in the same circuit an electromagnetic marker
such as is used for physiological purposes. This gave poor results, but

still they were encouraging. On placing a Breguet's chronograph in
circuit the results were much better, and it was evident that there was a

movement of the vibrator of the chronograph for each note or chord
emitted by the phonograph. The Committee then heard of an ingenious
apparatus devised by Heurtley of Breslau, by which he has succeeded in
recording by electrical and mechanical arrangements the sounds of the
heart. His apparatus consists essentially of a large stethoscope on which
a peculiar resonator is fixed. The I'esonator carries a small wooden
tuning-fork, between the prongs of which is fixed a simple microphonic
contact of two carbon buttons. This is one half of the apparatus. The
other half consists of an electro-magnet, over the poles of which is fixed,
face downwards, a shallow tambour, of the Marey pattern, having on its
under surface a broad ferrotype plate. This tambour is then connected
with an extremely delicate recording tambour. It is evident that the
second half of this apparatus is exactly what is wanted for the phono-
graph work, and, by the kindness of Professor Heurtley, the apparatus

was made in Tiibingen without delay. When placed in the circuit along

with the carbon transmitter the pen of the recording tambour moves at
right angles to the line of revolution of the cylinder with each tone and

chord played by the phonograph. When the ear perceives tones of con-

siderable intensity the lever point is seen moving through a greater
distance than when the tones are weaker ; consequently we have a

graphic record of the variations in intensity. If the recording cylinder

is timed to travel at the same rate as the cylinder of the phonograph,
then the curves on the former exactly correspond to the ensemble of the
minute marks on the latter corresponding to a particular variation in

intensity. When the recording cylinder is caused to travel as fast as the

phonograph cylinder, the variation in the heights of the curves recorded

on the revolving cylinder is not so apparent as when the recording
cylinder travels more slowly. It is easy, however, to time the rate of
revolution of both cylinders by a chronograph. Thus we have found that
when the recording cylinder is travelling at such a rate that an extent of
surface of one-fourth of an inch corresponds to one-fourth of a second, an
easily read tracing is obtained. In such a distance we may have one little
wave representing the pressure of a chord lasting for one-fourth of a
second, or we may have from two to as many as fifteen little waves, often
varying much in general character. Suppose we find as many as fifteen

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

then each must have lasted not more than ^V^h of a second. Even then
the ear is able to follow the individual notes when the phonogi-aph is
listened to simultaneously. This may be readily done either by listening
directly to the phonograph or by connecting a telephone with the secon-
daiy of an induction coil, while the current in which the variable resistance
            ox PHYSIOLOGICAL APPLICATIOXS OF THE PHONOGRAPH. G73

apparatus is interposed passed through the primary. If, then, we hold
the telephone to the ear while we look at the little pen writing on the

 recording drum, it is easy to see that the sensations are simultaneous.

Now if a note of a pitch, say, of 300 vibrations per second lasts only

^jigth of a second, it is evident that only five vibrations must have occurred

in that time. This shows that we may appreciate a tone and decide

as to its pitch if only five vibrations fall on the ear. This conclusion
coincides with the opinion previously arrived at from a careful inspection
of the photographs and of the mechanically recorded curves. Of course

we assume that the music is being played by the phonograph in its proper
tempo. If the phonograph is made to travel faster, possibly it may be
found that pitch may be appreciated for even shorter periods. Examina-

tion of the curves shows that as a rule no ' chord ' lasts longer than half a
second. This method of recording seems well suited to the study of the

time relations if a series of complex sounds pour in upon the ear. By

causing the lever of the tambour to act on the siphon recorder, large curves
are readily obtained, and a complete tracing of a piece of music from the

phonograph cylinder may be transcribed on a band of paper about four

feet in length.

     If one doubts whether the movements of the recording lever are ex-,
pressions of the tones of the phonograph, three ways are open by which

--the statement may be put to the test : (1) Listen attentively with the

telephone, and at the same time watch the recording point. The sensa-
tions of hearing and of vision for any particular note are simultaneous.
(2) Remove the elastic tube from the recording tambour and place it
in the ear, and the music will be heard. (3) Lead the elastic tube from
the electric tambour to a recording phonograph, and a feeble record will
be obtained of the music, showing that all the vibrations are present.
In the last two experiments, as might be expected, quality suffers, but
the rhythm, the tempo, and the general character of the tune are repro-

duced.

     The apparatus may also be used for recording phonetic sounds, such as

syllabic sounds, words, sentences, «kc.

     4. The Committee desire reappointment and an additional grant of
i")/. It is proposed to carry out the following work during the year

1896-97 :--

     (1) To continue tha investigation, with the improved recorder, of the
phonographic curves of one or two selected instruments.

     (2) To investigate the curves of speech, taking simple syllabic sounds,
such as man, can, pat, rat, »tc.

     (3) To begin a series of phonographic records of dialects with the
view of ascertaining how far such records can be made available for
philological purposes. This investigation was suggested in the report of
the Committee made to the meeting at Ipswich in 1895, but it had to be
delayed from pressure of other woik.

   On the Ascent of Water hi Trees. By Francis Darwin, F.E.8.

                  [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

Within the last few years the problem of the ascent of water has entered
 on a new stage of existence. The researches which have led to this new

 development are of such weight and extent that they might alone occupy
 our time. It will be necessary, therefore, to avoid, as far as possible, going
 into ancient history. But it will conduce to clearness to recall some of
 the main stepping-stones in the progress of the subject.

   --The two questions to be considered are (1) What is the path of the

ascending water ? {'!) What are the forces which produce the rise ?

      (1) The first question has gone through curious vicissitudes. The>
majority of earlier writers assumed that the water travelled in the vessels.
This was not, however, a uniform view. Cpesalpinus, 1583, seems ' to have
thought that water moved by imbibition in the ' nerves.' Malpighi and

Ray held that the vessels serve for air, and the wood fibres for the ascent
of water. Halfcs,^ who believed in the 'sap-vessels' as conduits, speculated

on the passage upwards of water between the wood and the bark. Also,^

that water may travel as vapour not in the liquid state. In the present
century Treviranus,'* 1835, held tliat water travelled in vessels De CandoUe,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

1832, that the intercellular spaces were the conduits. In Balfour's 'Manual
of Botany,' 1863, vessels, cells, and intercellular spaces are spoken of as
transmitting the ascending water.

     The change in botanical opinion was introduced by the great authority
of Sachs,' who took up Unger's view*"^ that the transpiration current travels
in tlie thickness of the walls as water of imbibition.

   --Then followed the reaction against the irabibitionists a reaction'

which has maintained its position up to the present time. Boehm, who
had never adoj^jted the imbibition theory, must liave tlie credit of initiating
this change : his style was confused and his argument marred by many

faults, but the reaction should in fairness be considered as a conversion
to his views, as far as the path of the travelling water is concerned.

Nevertheless, it was the work of others who principally forced the change

on botanists e.g., von Hohnel,^ Elfving,^ Russow,^ R. Hartig,'" Vesque,"
Godlewski,'^ and others.

     (2) The second question has a curious history, and one that is not
particularly creditable to botanists generally. It has been characterised

ON THE ASCENT OF WATER IN TREES.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  G75

by loose reasoning, vagueness as to physical laws, and a general tendency
to avoid the problem, and to sci'amble round it in a mist of vis a terrjo,
capillarity, Jamin chains, osmosis, and barometric pressure.

    An exception to this accusation (to which I personally plead guilty) is

to be found in Sachs' imbibition theory, in which, at any rate, the baro-
 metric errors were avoided, though it has difficulties of its own, as Elf vin'^

has pointed out.

     But the most hopeful change in botanical speculation began with those
naturalists who, concluding that no purely physical causes could account
for the facts, invoked the help of the living elements in the wood. To
Westermaier ' and Godlewski ^ is due the credit of this notable advance

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

for, whether future research uphold or destroy their conclusions, it claims
our sympathy as a serious facing of the problem by an ingenious and

rational hypothesis.^

    We may pass over the cloud which arose to witness for and against

these theories, and proceed at once to Strasburger's great work,^ in which,
with wonderful courage and with the industry of genius, he set himself
to work out the problem de novo, both anatomically and physiologically.

myIn opinion it is difficult to praise too highly this great effort of

Strasburger's.

    Strasburger's general conclusion is now well known. He convinced

himself that liquid can be raised to heights greater than that of the
barometric column in cut stems, in which the living elements have been
killed. Therefore, the cause of the rise could not be (1) barometric
pressure, (2) nor root pressure, (3) nor could it be due to the action of

the living elements of the wood. His conclusions may be stated as
follows :--

     {a) The sscent of water is not dependent on living elements, but is a
purely physical phenomenon.

     (6) None of the physical explanations hitherto made are sufficient to

account for the facts.

     Strasburger has been most unjustly depreciated, because his book ends

in this confession of ignorance. I do not share such a view. I think to

establish such distinct, though negative, conclusions would be, in this

most nebulous of subjects, an advance of great value. Whether he has

established these conclusions must of course be a matter of opinion. To

discuss tliem both would be to go over 500 pages of Strasburger's book, and
will not here be attempted. Conclusion («) that the ascent is not de-
pendent on living elements must, however briefly, be discussed, because it

is hei-e that the roads divide. If we agree with Strasburger, we know
that we must seek along the physical line ; if %ve differ from him, we are

bound to seek for the missing evidence of the action of the living

elements.

  --Schtvendener's Criticism. Perhaps the best plan will be to consider

the most serious criticism that has been published of Strasburger's
work, namely, Schwendener's paper ' Zur Kritik,' &c.'^

--676 REPORT 1896.

Schwendener objects that although a continuous column of water

cannot be raised by air pressure to a greater height than that of the

barometric column, yet when broken into a number of columns, as in the

case of a Jamin chain, that a column considerably over 10 m., even as

much as 13 or 14 m., of water can be suspended. This, though not fatal

to Strasburger's conclusions, is no doubt a serious criticism. For if 13 m.

can be supported, some of Strasburger's experiments are inconclusive. He

finds that a branch can suck up a poisonous fluid to over 10 m., and, as

above explained, argues that all ascent above that height, not being due

to barometric pressure or to the living elements (since the wood is

poisoned), is for the present inexplicable. But, if Schwendener is right,

the effect above 10 m. may have been due to atmospheric pressure.

Askenasy (loc. cit. infra, 1895, p. 6) objects to Schwendener that the

supposed action cannot be continuous. By repeating the diminution of

air pressure at the upper end the movement of water becomes less and

less, and sinks to almost nothing. Askenasy adds, moreover, that the

amount of water which could be raised according to Schwendener's theory

would be very small.

One difficulty about Schwendener's theory is that the result depends

on the length of the elements of which the chain is made up (such

element being a water column plus an air bubble). In his paper ' Ueber

das Saftsteigen ' ' he finds that the elements of the chain in Fayus equal

in round numbers 0'5 mm. In his paper "^ ' Wasserbewegung in der

Jamin'schen Kette ' he finds the element in Acer j)seHdo-j}latanus=-0'9 mm.,

in Acer platanoides and Uhnus ejf)isct=^0"2. But the calculation (1892,

p. 934) is based on the exi.stence of a chain in which the wate^ columns

are each 10 mm. in length ; a condition of things which he allows does not

.occur in living trees.

     But even if we allow Schwendener to prove theoretically the possi-

bility of a Jamin chain being raised to a height much greater than that

of a barometric column, I do not think he' invalidates Strasburger's posi-

tion. Schwendener's idea necessitates tlie travelling of a Jamin chain as

a whole, i.e., the translation, not only of water, but of air bubbles. But

this cannot (as Strasburger points out) apply to liis experiments on coni-

fers, in which the movement of air to such an extent is impossible.'^

And for the case of dicotyledonous woods, Strasburger has shown that

the movement of air is excluded by the fact that transverse walls occur

in the vessels at comparatively short distances. In Aristolochia the sec-

tions may be as long as 3 m., but in ordinary woods, according to Adler,''

we get :  Alnus, 6 cm. ;  Corylus,  11 cm. ;  Betula,  12 cm.                         Quercus,
                                                                                   ;

57 cm. ; Robinia, 69 cm. These facts seem impossible to reconcile with

Schwendener's views.

  --Action of the Poisonoris Fluids i>i Strasburger's Experiments.

The question whether the living elements are killed in Strasburger's

experiments is of primary importance in the problem.

  --Schwendener does not criticise it at length ; he seems to assume ·' as
--far as I can understand that since the death of the tissues extends

gradually from the cut end upwards, there are living cells in the upper

          ' K. Preuss. Akad. 1886, p. 661.

part which may still be effecti\p. He also doubts ' whether the cells were
always killed at once.' The tirst objection of Schwendener's may or may

not be sound, but in any case it does not (as Strasburger points out) ac-
count for the experiment ' in which an oak stem was poisoned by picric
acid, and three days afterwards was placed in fuchsin-picric. The second

reagent had to travel in tissues already killed with picric acid, yet a height

of 22 m. was reached.
     The question whether the reagents kill the cells in Strasburger's

experiments does not lend itself to discussion. It is diiiicult to see how
they should escape, and we have Strasburger's direct statement that the
living tissues were visibly killed. It must not be forgotten that in some

of his experiments the death of the tissues was produced by prolonged
boiling, not by poisons.^ Thus the lower 12 m. of a Wistaria stem were
killed in this way, yet liquid was sucked up to a height of 108 cm. In
the Histolog. Beitr., v. p. 64, he has repeated his air-pump experiment,
using a boiled yew branch, and found that eosin was sucked up from a

vessel in which almost complete \acuum was established, so the action of

living elements and of atmospheric pressure was excluded.

    On the whole, the balance of evidence is, in my judgment, against the

belief that the living elements are necessary for the rise of water. In

other words, I think we should be justified, from Strasburger's work, in

seeking the cause of ascent in the action of purely physical laws.

  --Strasburger's general argument from the structure of wood. It seems

sometimes to be forgotten that, apart from the physiological or experi-

mental evidence, there is another line of argument founded on the

structure of wood. Strasburger's unrivalled knowledge allows him to use

this ai-gument Avith authority, and he seems to me to use it with effect.

Thus ^ he points out that though in coniferous wood the action of the

living elements in pumping water is conceivable, yet this is far from being

universally the case. He points out that in the monocotyledons such

theories meet with almost unconquerable difficulties. This is, he says,

Heespecially the case in Dracfena.          goes on to point to difficulties in the

case of such dicotyledons as Albizzia. The case may perhaps best be put

in the generalised manner that Strasburger himself employs.-* If the

living elements are of such importance as Godlewski, Westermaier, and

Schwendener hold, we ought not to find these difficulties; we ought

rather to find structural peculiarities pointing distinctly to the existence

of such functions. For instance, we ought to find the tracheal water-path

actually interrupted by living elements, which might act like a series of
pumping stations one above the other. It should, however, be remem-
bered that if we deny the importance of the medullary rays and other
living elements in raising watei', we ought to be able to point more clearly
than we can at present to the function of the medullary rays and to

structural adaptations to these functions.

   --The ivork of Dixon and Joly and of Ashenasy. I now pass on to the

recent woi-k in which Strasburger's indications to search along a purely
physical line have been followed ; namely, the paper of Dixon and Joly,'

     ' Hist. Beitr. v. p. 12.               Also Annals of Bot., vol. viii. ; Phil. Trans.,

which was followed by that of Askenasy.* The leading idea common
to these works is now well known, namely, that the raising of water

to the tops of trees depends on the quality which water possesses of

resisting tensile stress. To most botanists the existence of this quality
is a new idea. To believe that columns of water should hang in the

tracheals like solid bodies, and should, like them, transmit downwards the

pull exerted on them at their upper ends by the transpiring leaves, is

to some of us equivalent to believing in ropes of sand.

Askenasy has earned the gratitude of his botanical readers by giving

some of the evidence which demonstrates the existence of this property of

Awater.^      tube a meter in length was filled by Donny with water, and the

remaining space was as far as possible freed from air. When the tube was

placed vertically the water-column at the tipper end hung there, and could
not be made to break or free itself from the glass bj^ violent shaking.

Berthelot filled a thick-wall capillary tube completely with water at

28°-30 C.° ; it was ahowed to cool to 18°, so that the space left Ijy the

shrinking of water was filled with air. It was then sealed up and again

warmed to 28"-30°, so that the air was dissolved in the water. When it

was allowed to cool again it retained its A'olume, filling the tube com-

Apletely.     slight shake, however, allowed the water to break and return

to its proper volume at 18° with the appearance of a bubble of air. In

this experiment the water contained air, yet it seems to have been until

recently assumed by some physicists that, to show cohesion, water must

be air-free. If this were the case the application of the principle to

plants would be impossible. Dixon and Joly have, however, proved that

this is not so, and this forms an important part of their contribution to

the subject.

They also ^ investigated the amount of tension which water under

these circumstances will bear, and found it about equal to seven atmo-

spheres. If, therefore, tlie leaves at the top of a tall tree can exert the

requisite upward jiull on the water in the trunk, it seems certain (if no

other conditions in the problem interfere) that the pull can be transmitted

to the level of the ground. This opens up the question whether the leaves

can exert this traction on the water in the tracheals, and what is equally

important. Are there any factors in the j^roblem incompatible with the

theory ?

   --1. The sucking force of tlie leaves. In Dixon and Joly's first paper '

tliey assume that tractional force is given by the meniscuses ' formed

in the membranous rcseau of the evaporating cell walls,' as well as pos-

Wesibly by the osmotic action of the cells of the mesophyll.  shall take

these theories in order. Our knowledge of the cell wall does not allow us

to believe in the existence of pores visible with even the highest powers of

the microscope. Dixon's more general expressioit,''' ' surface tension forces

developed in the substance of the walls of the evajiorating cells,' is there-

fore preferable. But Askenasy seems to rue to state the matter much

more con^'eniently by using the term ' imbibition.' ^ The force with which

vegetable membranes, e.g., the thallus of Laminaria, absorb water has been

demonstrated by Reinke and others, and the existence of such a force is

familiar to botanists.

     Both Askenasy (Joe. cit.) and Dixon and Joly - have pointed out that the

force of imbiljition, or the surface tension forces, as the case may be, can

exert a tractional effect on the water in the tracheals, when the turges-

cence of the mesophyll has been destroyed. But Askenasy in his original

paper (1895), Dixon in the January 1896 paper, and again Askenasy in his

second paper (March, 1896) have also considered the imbibitional or surface

tension forces in connection with the turgescent cell. In his 1896 paper

Dixon in fact gives up the view published in the Phil. Trans, and adopts

the view given by Askenasy in his original j^aper, that the tractional force

is supplied by the osmotic suck of the leaves. It must clearly be under-

stood that this does not remove imbibition from the problem. It is one

of the chief merits of Askenasys work that he clearly sees and states the

important relation between these foi'ces.'^ The sun's heat causes the

evaporation of the water with which the walls of the mesophyll cells are

imbibed : this water is replaced by imbibition from the cell-sap. The con-

centration of the cell-sap so produced maintains the osmotic force of the

cell, which again exerts suction on the watei" on the tracheals.*

I have now given, in its simplest form, the modern theory of the rise

of water. Apart from the main idea, it combines the points of several

familiar views. Imbibition becomes a factor of paramount importance,

though not in the way that Sachs employs it. The suspended threads

of water remind us of Elfving's cajaillary theory, while the living-element

--factor is represented by the turgescent mesophyll cells.
     Resistance. It is not possible to discuss the question whether the

tractional forces in the leaf are sufficient for the work imposed on them
until we know what is the resistance to the passage of water through wood.

For it is clear that the work done by the leaf includes, not only the lifting

of a given column, but the overcoming of the resistance to its How.

The resistance to the flow of the transjjiration current is in want of

further investigation. Janse ' has discussed the question, and points out

{he. cit., p. 36) that two kinds of resistance must be reckoned with. The
first (which he calls statical) is illustrated by means of a cylinder of Pinus

wood fixed to the short arm of a J tube filled with water, when it was

found that in five days the level of water in the long arm was only
1 mm. above that in the short arm."* That is to say, Avheii time enough

is given, the resistance is practically nothing. Janse has also investigated

the resistance to the passage of water flowing through wood at the rate of

an ordinary transpiration current. His method seems to me open to criti-

mycism, but this is not the place to give  reasons.  His experiments give

a wide range of results. With Pinus strobus a pressure of water equal to

ten times the length of the wood was required to force water through at

a pace equal to the transpiration current. In Ginkgo the pressure was

twenty-one times the length of the wood. Strasburger ' has repeated

Janse's experiment, and finds a column ' several times the length of the

object ' necessarj'. Nageli - found that 760 mm. of mercury were needed

to force water through fresh coniferous wood at tJie rate of ttV mm. per
second, i.e., at 180 mm. per hour. If we allow one metre per hour as a

fair transpiration rate,'' Ave get a pressure of 5 atmospheres required to

produce such a flow. To return to Janse's experiments : even if we

=assume that the resistance (expressed in water) 5 times the length, it

is clear that with a tree 40 m. in height, the resistance of 20 atmospheres

has to be overcome. This would not be a pressui'e greater than that which

osmotic forces are able to exert ; but when we come to a tree of 80 m.

in height, and a resistance of 40 atmospheres, the thing becomes serious."*

A great difficulty in the question of resistance is that the results hitherto

obtained are (though here I speak doubtfully) much greater than those

obtained by physicists for the resistance of water flowing in glass capil-

laries. Until this discrepancy is explained, it is rash to argue from our

present basis of knowledge.''

   --Is the osmotic siick sufficient ? The osmotic force of a turgescent cell

is usually measured by its power of producing hydrostatic pressure within

the cell. Thus, De Vries'' investigated the force necessary to extend

a plasmolysecl shoot to its original length ; Westermaier ^ the weight

necessary to crush a tissue of given area ; Pfeff"er ^ the pressure exerted

by growing roots ; Krabbe '^ the pressure under which cambium is capable

of maintaining its growth.

    The figures obtained by these naturalists have a wide range ; it may

be said that the hydrostatic pressure varies between 3 and 20 atmospheres.

Another method is to ascertain the osmotic strength of tJie cell-sa}} in

terms of a KNO;j solution, and calculate the pressure which such a solution

KNO^can produce. According to Pfeflfer,'" 1 per cent.  with artificial

=membrane gives a pressure of 176 cm. 2'3 atmospheres. DeVries'^
=calculates that in a cell a O'l equivalent solution (practically 1 per cent.)

Wegives a pressure of 3 atmospheres.  may therefore take it as between

2'5 and 3 atmospheres. Now, De Vries found that beetroot requires

6-7 per cent. KNOj to plasmolyse it; this would mean 15 -- 21 atmo-

spheres. I do not know what is the greatest pressure which has been

estimated in this way. Probably Wieler's '^ estimate of the pressure in

the developing medullaiy ray cells of Finns sylvestris at 21 atmospheres

is the highest. It is clear that investigation of the osmotic capacity of

assumed. Thus Schwendener (JiT. Prevss. Aliad., 1886, p. 584) calculates from an

was only 2 metres per day.

leaves for high trees is wanted ; also investigations of the variation in
osmotic power produced by varying resistances in the flow of the current.
The experiments of Pfeffer and others ' show that the osmotic strength of

--cell-sap is capable of great adaptation to circumstances cells respond

by increased turgescence to various stimuli. Whether they can respond

sufficiently to account for the ascent of water is another question.

    My own opinion is that the question of resistance to the flow of water

is a difficulty which the authors of the modern theory have not sufficiently

met. Unless it can be shown that the resistance to the flow of water in
wood is less than that indicated by existing researches, we must face
the fact that we do not at present know of osmotic forces which we can

suppose capable of raising water to a greater height than 40 metres.

   --Continuity of the luater in the tracheah. The theory we are considering

apparently requires that there shall be continuous columns of water from

leaf to root, because a break in the column means a collapse of the
machinery. This seems at first sight a fair assumption, though I doubt
its complete correctness. It is in any case worthy of discussion. It has
been constantly insisted on by Sachs and others tlaat at the time of most

active transpiration the vessels contain air, and not water. It is therefore

a violent disturbance of our current views to believe in continuous

columns of water.

    For evidence on this point we are chiefly indebted to Strasburger. It

is a remarkable fact that he should, without any theory to encourage such

a view, have come to the conclusion that approximate continuity of water

columns is a condition of primary importance, and that he should have

made out the cognate fact that the whole of the alburnum need not be

simultaneously occupied  by a transpiration current                                                                                     parts of  it may be  so

occupied, while parts of it are filled with air, and do not function as water

ways. This is a valuable contribution to knowledge, and to the adherents

of the new theory it is priceless ; the very existence of their hypothesis
may depend on it.

Strasburger's statements and reasoning are by no means accepted by

everyone ; for instance, Schwendener refuses to take them seriously.^
     Strasburger has microscopically examined the condition of the tracheals

as regards air.^ He found in the spruce fir in July ' almost no air bubbles '

in the Avood of the current year, but air in considerable quantity in four-

year-old wood. In the same month Pinus Salzmanni {Laricio) showed
scattered bubbles in the spring wood of last year, and more in the autumn
wood. In a larch there were only very occasional bubbles in the two
last years' wood. In the silver fir the current year's wood was practically
free from air : the air increased in the inner rings. Tsuga canadensis
had no air in this year's wood, only a little in last year's, and an in-
creasing quantity in the older rings, the fifth being very rich in air. In

February Finns strobus had hardly any air in this year's wood, and the

silver fir was all but free from it in the youngest ring. Robinia in July

had the youngest wood almost air-free. Ficus elastica and spuria, various

Acacias, and willows gave vessels not entirely free from air, but nearly so.

682 REPORT--1896.

He concludes ' that the path of the transpiration current is not absolutely

free from air. The younger wood, which especially functions as the water-
carrier, is the most free.

     Dixon and Joly quote Strasburger's results, which they consider
sufficiently favourable to their views. They rely, in addition, on the
impermeability of wet cell-walls to air isolating the conduits in which

air has appeared ; and on the possibility that the air may be redissolved

under root pressure,- an idea well worth testing.
      I think Strasburgei''s facts are not so favourable to their theory as

these authors believe ; in the same way it seems to me that Askenasy is
rash in saying ^ that the tracheals in many cases contain continuous

columns of water. It is true that this statement does not affect the
validity of his general argument, since he faces the undoubted occurrence

of air bubbles in many cases. This is undoubtedly necessary, and fortu-
nately we can once more turn to the Leitnnyshalbnen. Sti'asburger states

that he has seen water creep past the air bubbles ' in coniferous tracheids.
The best evidence for this seems ta be the fact mentioned '' that the part
of a single tracheid in front of an air bubble gets red with absorbed
eosin, though the neighbouring tracheids are colourless. This clearly
suggests the creej^ing round the bubble which Strasburger believes in.
Schwendener^ has been unable to confirm Strasburger's microscopic obser-
vations, and, moreover, denies the physical possibility of the phenomena.

I am unable to judge of the validity of Schwendener's theoretic objections,

and must leave this point. It is a question of great importance whether
it is possible that on the breaking of a column of water a film of water
remains surrounding the air bubble, and capable of holding the two
columns together. If this is impossible we must suspend our judgment
until we know more of the contents of the tracheals.

     To sum up this part of the subject, we may believe that the tracheals
in their youngest condition may contain water in continuous columns,

since the cambium cells from which they arise certainly contain fluid.
But we know also that this condition is not absolutely maintained, since
Strasburger has shown that the young wood contains air, though in small
quantity. "We must therefore believe either (1) that the ti-anspiration

·current is able to travel past the air-bubbles, or (2) that tracheals partly

filled with air may again become continuous waterways by solution of the
air. If we adopt the first alternative we must believe that the film of

water between the bubble and the wall of the vessel is able to bear such
a tensile stress that it can serve to link the column above with the
column below the bubble. But this is analogous to trusting a rope so

neai'ly cut through that only a few threads remain intact. With regard
to the second alternative, we have at least indications from Strasburger's
 work that a tracheal, partly filled with air, does not necessarily remain

permanently functionless (see Leitunr/shahnen, p. 692).

   --The isolation of the tracheals. There are a number of points connected

with the structure and properties of wood which ought to be considered

in relation to the modem theories. Want of space forbids my doing more

than referring to two of them.
     The resistance which the wetted cell- wall offers to the passage of un-

dissolved air is a point on which many writers have laid stress. It is
clear that on any theory of the movement of water in the tracheal? it

is essential that air should not filter into the waterway. This necessity

is not, however, stronger in the case of the modern theories we are consider-
ing. The pressure tending to fill the tracheals with air from outside cannot
be greater than atmospheric pressure, and since the wetted cell walls of
g& ymnospermous wood can resist the passage of air under a pi^essure of
about an atmosphere,' we need not fear criticism of the theory on this
ground. The above remarks seem, however, to be needed in face of the
frequently recurring statement that wet wood membranes are impermeable
to fi'ee air. Schwendener has some good remarks on this head.-

      Strasburger has called attention to the important subject of the

Whenlocalisation or isolation of vessels or of certain lines of tracheids.

this is possible we may have one set of tracheals containing continuous

water columns, while neighbouring ones contain air at negative pressure.^
This is especially important in connection with the Dixon-Joly-Askenasy
theory, since, if there were no such isolation, a functioning tracheal con-
taining a continuous column of water would give up its water to one which
was not functioning. In other words, the inactive tracheals would, by nega-
tive pressure, suck water from the active ones. In the coniferous trees the

young wood is cut oft' by the absence of pits in the tangential walls ^ from
free communication with the older wood, where air is more frequent.

     In the same Avay the valve-like closure of the pits by the aspiration
of the pit membrane comes to be a subject of much importance.

     At present I merely wish to show by a couple of examples the necessity
of a complete study of the minute structure of wood in relation to the

modern theories. It is at least a hopeful fact for Messrs. Dixon, Joly, and
Askenasy that we cannot point to anything in the anatomy of wood which
is absolutely inconsistent with their views. Finally, with regard to the

question at large, whether we are friends or opponents of Messrs.

Dixon, Joly, and Askenasy's theory, the broad facts remain, that water
has the power of resisting tensile stress, and that this fact must hence-

forth be a factor in the problem. There are difficulties in the way of our
authors' theory, but it is especially deserving of notice that many of these

difficulties are equally serious in the case of any theory which excludes
the help of the living elements of the wood, and assumes a flow of water
in the tracheals. The authors have not only suggested a vera causa, but

have done so without multiplying difficulties. There is therefore a dis-

tinct balance in their favour.

     Huxley, quoting from Goethe, makes use of the expression thiitige

Skepsis. It is a frame of mind highly appropriate to us in the present
juncture if we interpret it to mean a state of doubt who.se fruit is activity,
and if we translate activity by experiment.

The Committee are not yet in a position to present a definitive report ; in

the meantime they desire to place on record the results obtained by in-

dividual members of the Committee and others, as their experience may

be of immediate service to those interested in this subject.

    Mr. W. Gardiner points out tliat in his opinion the processes of

(1) killing, and (2) fixing and mounting, have not been kept sufficiently

distinct. The killing of the protoplasm should be as rapid as possible, so

Heas to avoid active plasraolysis.   suggests (1) hot glacial acetic acid,

owing   to  its  power  of  rapid  penetration  ;  (2)  superheated  steam                       (3)  strong
                                                                                              ;

alcohol. If a rapidly acting substance cannot be used, a poisonous solu-

tion, possessing as nearly as possible the same osmotic equivalent as the

cell-sap, should be employed. After the tissues have been killed they may

be preserved in any suitable liquids, e.g. 70 per cent, spirit, or solution of

formic aldehyde.

     Professor Farmer has made a number of experiments with formic

aldehyde. He agrees with Mr. Gardiner as to the advisability of a

preliminary and rapid killing, and finds that green parts of plants im-

mersed in strong alcohol for a short time, then transferred to strong

solutions of copper acetate, and finally preserved in formic aldehyde, gave

better results than when the preliminary killing in spirit was omitted.

For most plants experimented on, he finds that strong solutions (15-30 per

cent, of the commercial ' formaline ') in weak (15-20 per cent.) spirit give
better results than weaker solutions. In all cases the specimens were

greatly improved by the treatment with copper acetate or sulphate (see

Professor Trail's report. Appendix II.). Without this, the green colour

had, with but few exceptions, failed after immersion in the formic aldehyde

for four months, although they had in some cases shown no change until

three months had elapsed.

    Mr. J. R. Jackson, of the Royal Gardens, Kew, finds that a saturated

solution of salt, boiled to expel air, and carefully stoppered, is useful for

many fieshy fruits, some of which, e.g. apples, retain their colour very

well under this treatment. He finds Goadby's solution, formerly so much

employed, unsatisfactory, and considers methylated spirit, on the whole,

the best of the liquids in common use. Formic aldehyde has been tried on
a number of plants, with good results in some cases, especially with those

fruits with red or reddish tints and firm flesh.

     In drying large specimens of succulent plants or fruits, it is important

that the process should not be hurried, or cracking and warping may

ensue.

     The following methods, devisetl by Mr. Tagg, assistant in the museum

--at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, are in use there :

   --1. For cementing Specimens to Glass, Mica, <&c. Gelatine is necessary

for large specimens, and though becoming opaque in alcohol may be used

when the specimen is sufficiently large to hide the cement.

Delicate specimens that dry when exposed to air for a very short time

can be fixed to the glass with gelatine while still in alcohol. To do this a

pipette with hot water jacket is required (see figure).

  --Pipette. An ordinary pipette is surrounded by an outer tube forming

a jacket, in which water is put.

   --Method of using Pipette with Hot-water Jacket. Gelatine is taken

into the pipette, the outer tube filled with water, and the whole

placed in a beaker of boiling water till the

water in the jacket surrounding the pip-

ette is also boiling. The specimen is laid

in a flat dish in alcohol ; at the bottom is
also the glass to which specimen is to be

cemented. Having decided where specimen

shall be fastened, the pipette with hot water

is put quickly into the sjDirit, its , orifice is

made to touch the glass, and some of the hot

gelatine is forced out. With the other hand

the specimen is now gently pressed into the

still soft gelatine and held in position for a

second or two. The gelatine soon hardens,

and the specimen is permanently fixed.

   --2. For making flat-sided Vessels to hold

Sp)ecimens. Pieces of glass are cut to required Boiling water

sizes for the sides of the vessel, and are then

fastened together in the following manner :

1 oz. Nelson's amber gelatine is soaked in

water for twelve hours. Water not absorbed

is poured off, and the softened gelatine is

melted over hot water. To this are added 0"5       Gelatine
grm. of bichromate of potash and 10 drops of

glycerine. The cement is put on warm.

Professor Errera sent an account of ex-

periments conducted in his museum in Brus-

sels, and his statements are in agreement with

those already set forth. He finally decides

against all liquid preservative media in cases

in which it is desired to retain the original

colour, and substitutes a method of rapid                      Iliibber pad to make

desiccation in sand. By this means he has                        joint water-tight.

been able to prepare specimens which have

remained unaltered as to colour for a considerable number of years. The

method was described by E. Cornells in ' La Belgique horticole,' August

1880. Professor Errera states that the drying in vacno, as recommended

by E. Cornelis, is, however, unnecessary. The dried specimens are preserved

in airtight bottles, which contain in their hollowed stoppers some calcium

oxide, in order to absorb any moisture from the air within the bottles.

The reports of Professors Errera and Trail appear of special import-

ance, and are printed in full, forming Appendices I. and II.

jusqu'ici employes a I'lnstitut Botanique sont : le ' liquide au sublime,' la
solution saturee de sel marin, et les solutions de formol (=aldehyde

formique).

     Notre liquide au sublime a la composition suivante :

  --Liquide cm sublime'. Nos essais avec ce liquide datent de 1893.

    En voici le resultat : Les feuilles vertes sont soit decolorees [Lathyrus,

Dioscorea), soit plus ou moins brunies {Quercus, Huinulus). Les racines
sont bien conservees (Lathyrus). Les feuilles rouges (Quercus) et les
fleurs rouges (Freycinetia) sont brunies.

(VjEthalium sejyticum se sont bien conservees.

     Les Champignons [Aiiwnita, Clavaria, Sajyrolegnia) ont pris une teinte

   --Solutions deformol (=aldehyde formique). Nos essais avec ce liquide

datent de 1894. II n'est pas invraisemblable que I'aldehyde formique
puisse se decomposer en presence des matieres organiques, de sorte que la
concentration des solutions baisse sans doute progressivement.

     Dans le formol a 1 pour mille, les parties vegetales charnues depassant
le niveau du liquide ont generalement moisi, et le liquide lui-meme s'est

couvert d'une couche epaisse de mycelium. Un mycelium analogue se

developpe parfois a la surface du formol a 1 pour mille, meme

lorsque aucun tissu vegetal ne vient eraerger.
     Pour les objets qui sont depuis le printemps de 1894 dans le formol a

1 pour mille, on remarque que :

     Les feuilles sont devenues vert-sale (Lamium, Arum) ou sont com-

pletement decolorees (Sinapis).
      Les tissus incolores le sont restes (racines de Sinapis, racines d'Uvony-

mus) ou ont bruni (fleurs de Vihurnuvi).
      Les corolles bleuatres {FritiUaria jjersica) sont decolorees.
      Les corolles rouges [Antirrhinum majus) ont conserve une certaine

coloration ; les rouge-brunatres [Primula variabilis) egalement.

     La coloration du spadice A'Arxim maculatum reste bien marque'e ;
seulement, du violet fonce elle a passe a une teinte bleuatre intense.

       ON PRESERVATIOX OF PLANTS FOR EXHIBITION.                    G89

     Dans tous les liquides aqueux (A-F), les tissus sont deja devenus
flasques ; les matiyres colorantes rouges, roses, bleues, solubles dans I'eau,

ont disparu ; le jaune insoluble (CoroniUa) s'est bien conserve ; la chloro-

phylle commence a brunir dans la plupart des feuilles, sauf Selaginella,
Pandanus et Oplistnenus, qui se sont, jusqu'ici, parfaitement conserves,
avec leur teinte verte et leur panachure blanche.

     Dans les alcools faibles (G-J) les tissus sont devenus flasques ; dans

I'alcool a 60 pour cent (K) et surtout dans celui a 70 pour cent (L), ils le
sont devenus beaucoup moins. Les tissus rouges, roses et bleus sont

decolor^s comme dans les liquides aqueux ; le jaune s'est moins bien con-

serve ; les tissus verts se decolorent ou brunissent.
     Dans I'alcool acidul^ (M) beaucoup de tissus ont bruni, mais ils sont

en train de se decolorer ensuite. Les tissus rouges, roses et bleus ont
perdu leur matiere colorante ; la fleur jaune a pris une teinte sale.

     L'alcool avec chlorure d'aluminium (N) n'a pr^sente aucun avantage

--reel.
     Conclusion. Des divers liquides essayes, aucun ne conserve d'une
manifere satisfaisante et durable la couleur des objets verts. Pour certains
objets colores (fleurs jaunes, spadices d'Arum, fleurs rouges d'Anti7-rhinum,
Primula, etc.), les liquides aqueux (liquide au sublim^, ou formol a 1 pour

cent) conviennent assez bien.

    En somme, dans les Musees, les objets conserves dans les liquides ne

seront agreables a I'ceil qu'a la condition d'etre uniformement decolor^s,
blanchis, par le procede de de Vries. H. de Vries conserve les objets

ainsi decolores dans I'alcool ordinaire. On pourrait aussi, je pense, une

fois qu'ils sont tout a fait decolores, les conserver dans le liquide au
sublim^ (plus stable que le liquide au formol, plus economique que Talcool),
mais additionne d'alcool ou de glycerine de maniere a abaisser autant qu'il
est necessaire son point de congelation.

     Bien plus que les liquides, je recommanderai pour les Musees la con-

servation a sec.

                                   II. Conservation a Sec.

On saifc que les tissus vegetaux se conservent fort bien quand on les

dessfeche dans du sable chaud.

Ce procede a et^ applique avec un succes remarquable par un pharma-

cien beige bien connu, feu Louis Cornells de Diest (Belgique).

J'ai examine recemment des fleurs conservees a la lumiere par ce

procede depuis j)lus de seize ans et je puis declarer qu'i^ n'est guere j)os-

sihle de souhaiter mieux. Les fleurs ont si admirablement gard(5 leur

forme et, presque toutes, aussi leur couleur, qu'on les dirait cueillies

depuis un instant. Les teintes blanches, roses {Gloxinia), rouges {Hya-

cinthus, Pentstemon), violettes (Hijacinthus, Franciscea), bleu-pale (Scilla),

jaunes (Linaria vulgaris) sont parfaites. Certains rouges sont devenus

plus fonces qu'a I'etat frais {Digitalis purpurea).

Parmi les sepales verts, datant de plus de 16 ans, quelques-uns ont

assez bien conserve leur teinte ; d'autres ont bruni ou ont pali. Le
neveu et successeur de Louis Cornells, M. Joseph Cornells, pharmacien a

Ciney (Belgique), m'assure que les feuilles, bourgeons et racines se con-

servent aussi bien que les fleurs : mais ce point meriterait d'etre bien fixe

par de nouveaux essais.

Le procede employe a ete publie par son auteur dans la Belgique horti-

cole (aout 1880). II est d'application facile. M. Clautriau, que j'avais

690 REPORT--1896.

prie d'en faire I'essai, a obtenu un succes complet, comme pourront le con-
stater mes honorables collegues de la Commission : je viens, en effet, de
leur adresser par I'intermediaire de M. le professeur J. B. Farmer un
flacon avec les fleurs et les feuilles que M. Clautriau a ainsi dessechees.

Ce sont les specimens suivants :

Feuilles de :                         Fleurs de :
   Begonia Rex.                           Goldfussia a^iisophylla.
    Oplismeiius iinheciUis,fol. var.     CoroniUa glauca.

   Asplenium diversifolium.              Lamprococcus miniatus.
                                         Monochoitum ensiferum.
   Adiantum Cajnllus- Veneris.            Camellia japonica, fol, var.
Rameau de :
                                          Azalea amcena.
    Asj}aragus })lumostis.
                                         Kennedya sp.

                                          Gestiera sp.

Voici la marche a suivre :
Le specimen a conserver est pique dans un pot a fleurs ou dans un

cornet en papier, a moitie reniplis de sable sec et propre. Puis, on verse

doucement une nouvelle quantite de sable, de fa^on a recouvrir complete-

ment I'objet. II est laisse en cet etat, soit en presence d'acide sulfurique

sous une cloche oi\ Ton fait le vide et que Ton peut placer ensuite dans un

Aendroit chaud, soit simplement dans une etuve port^e a 35°-40° C.      ce

point de vue, les chambres thermostatiques ou les armoires chauflfantes,

comme il en existe maintenant dans la plupart de nos Instituts, con-

viennent fort bien. Apres quelques jours (8-10 au plus), le specimen doit

--etre retir^ du sable avec beaucoup de precaution, a cause de sa grande

fragilite. On le depouille du sable qui y adhere souvent, au moyen d'un

pinceau fin ou en laissant tomber sur lui du sable grossier d'une certaine

hauteur. II suffit maintenant de conserver I'objet dans un milieu bien
sec. Le mieux est de le placer dans un flacon a large goulot,' ferm(5 a

I'emeri par un bouchon de verre creux dont la cavite est aux deux tiers

remplie de fragments de chaux vive, retenus par un morceau de peau. Si

le flacon n'est pas souvent ouvert, la chaux vive n'a pas besoin d'etre

renouvel^e.

     Comme les objets sont extremement cassants, il peut etre utile de

les immobiliser en les coUant, par une goutte de gomnie arabique.

D'apres Cornells, la dessiccation reussit d'autant mieux qu'elle a ete

plus rapide : c'est pour cette raison qu'il a employe le vide ; mais cela n'est

nullement necessaire.

    Au sujet des changements de teintes que les fleurs ainsi traitees peu-

vent presenter, je crois bien faire en transcrivant les quelques renseigne-

·ments publics par Cornells (loc. cit.) :

    Un' certain nombre de fleurs changent de couleur par le fait de la

dessiccation seule par exemple, la Mauve qui est rose devient bleue
                                                                             ;

d'autres foncent en couleur ; ex. : la Passiflore, la Digitale pourpr^e, le

Colchique, la Fumeterre, etc.

' L'action de la lumi^re sur les couleurs des fleurs est tres- variable et

il n'est jamais possible de dire a priori quel en sera le r^sultat. Certaines

fleurs resistent parfaitement a la lumiere, meme a la lumiere directe du

soleil ; d'autres soiit deja influencees par la lumiei'e diffuse ; enfin il y en

a qui sont meme decolorees dans une demi-obscurite. Parmi les fleurs, les

jaunes sont les plus sensibles a Taction de la luiniere plus de la moitie
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

de celles experimentees sont completement decolorees. Trois plantes,
VAhutilon Sellowi, le Fritillaria imperialis et le Vanda suavis, presentent
un ph^nomene toutefois inattendu : par la dessiccation ces fleurs prennent
une couleur d'un brun roux et lorsqu'on les expose au soleil elles repren-
nent une couleur qui se rapproche assez de la primitive, excepte pour le

Fritillaria, qui devient violet.

      ' II est assez curieux de voir des fleurs repreiidre leur couleur au soleil,
alors que la plupart des autres la perdent.'

   --Conclusion. En resume, la dessiccation au sable, suivant le mode

applique par J. Cornelis, donne des resultats excellents pour un grand
nombre de specimens vegetaux int^ressants a exhiber au public.

    Au dire de I'auteur, c'est pour les fleurs jaunes qu'il convient le moins

bien. Mais peut-etre sufiit-il de les soustraire a la lumiere trop vive.

On a vu, du reste, que, dans nos quelques essais, les couleurs jaunes se

maintiennent justement tres bien dans le liquide au sublime ou dans celui

au formol.

   --Algues marines. J'ajouterai que Ton peut garder a sec les grandes

Algues marines (i^t<ci6S, Laminaria, etc.) en leur conservant leur souplesse,
si on les plonge d'abord, pendant 2-3 jours, dans I'eau de mer additionnee
de ^/lo de glycerine, et qu'on les laisse ensuite secher a I'air.

                             III. Preparation des Specimens.

   --De Vries. II a deja ete question du procede de de Vries pour la

decoloration des tissus vegetaux.

   --Vert de Methyle. D'un autre cote, j'ai obtenu de bons resultats dans

quelques essais d^ja anciens, en recolorant au moyen de vert de methyle

des tissus decolores par I'alcool. Les feuilles destinees k etre montrees
aux eleves et conservees dans la glycerine aqueuse, ont ainsi repris, en
apparence, leur teinte verte naturelle.

   --lode. Pour I'etude de la formation et de la disparition de Vamidon dans

les feuilles, on obtient des specimens tres instructifs par la methode succes-
sivement employee par Bohm, Hanstein et Sachs, et generalement connue

sous le nom de ' Sachs' Jodprobe.' Ces objets seront conserves dans de

I'alcool iode etendu de deux volumes d'eau, en flacons bien bouches.

     Une methode similaire m'a donne des preparations tout aussi

demonstratives pour I'accumulation et I'emploi du glycogene chez les
Champignons. Les pedicelles de Phallus imjncdicus conviennent tout

 specialement.

                             IV. Montage des Specimens.

   --Photoxyline. Pour mettre sous les yeux des visiteurs une serie de

sp(3cimens dans Talcool representant, par exemple, les etapes du developpe-
 mgnt d'un Gastromycete, ou diverses periodes de la germination, ou les
 ^tats successifs d'une fleur proterandrique, ou les stades de la digestion
 d'un insecte par une feuille de Drosera, etc., ou bien encore pour main-
 tenir les objets dans une position immuable, il est souvent nt^cessaire de
 les fixer sur une lame de verre. Le meilleur procede est I'emploi de la

 photoxyline.

      Les objets frais ou sortis de I'alcool sont colics sur le verre au moyen

 d'une goutte d'une solution sirupeuse de photoxyline de Griibler, dans
                         ----

692 REPORT-- 1896.

un melange de parties egales d'ether et d'alcool absolu. On plonge

ensuite la lame de verre avec I'objet, pendant 5 minutes, dans I'alcool a

70 pour cent. On retire et on conserve de preference dans Talcool fort, a

92 pour cent. La photoxyline est ainsi transparente et invisible.

L'alcool    absolu  dissoudrait    la    photoxyline                                                I'alcool trop  faible la
                                                                                                 ;

rendrait trouble. L'alcool acidule par HCl detache les objets.

     Dans les liquides au formbl, il y a e'galement moyen d'attacher les
objets avec de la photoxyline ; mais les details du procede ne me sont

pas encore connus.

   --Lames de Verre bleu. Quant aux specimens rendus absolument blancs

par le proc^d^ de de Vries, je les ai vu fixer (a I'LTniversite de Gand, si

je ne me trompe) sur une lame de verre, non pas blanc, mais bleu-fonce.

Cela est souvent d'un joli effet.

                    V. Recipients et Fermeture.

Je n'ai rien de particulier a- dire a ce sujet. Les flacons a faces

paralleles  sont,  dans  bien  de  cas,  pr^f^rables  aux                                           flacons  cylindriques
                                                                                                                                                           ;

mais ils sont d'un prix ^levd.

J'ai parle plus haut des 'flacons dessiccateurs Cornelis,' et de leur

emploi.

     La fermeture des recipients au moyen de bouchons en verre ou de

lames de verre est plus Elegante qu'au moyen de bouchons en li^ge.
Rien a en dire. Si Ton veut obtenir un bouchage hermetique au moyen

d'un bouchon en liege, il faut le plonger d'abord dans de la paraffine tres-

chaude, pour qu'il s'en impregne. Puis, apres I'avoir applique sur le flacon,

ou recouvre d'une nouvelle couche de paraffine le bord du flacon et le

bouchon lui-meme.

                               VI. IEtiquetage.

--jStiquettes. Inutile de dire que I'e^tiquette doit etre aussi claire que

possible, indiquant au public non seulement le nom de I'objet et son

origine, mais ^attirant encore I'attention sur les details les plus

Ainteressants.     ce point de vue, comme a tant d'autres, les collections

du Natii,ral History Museum, CvomvreW Road, sont du reste des modeles,

--Aet c'est aux Continentaux a y prendre des lemons.
Encre.             d^faut d'une etiquette imprimee, il faut naturellement

qu'on se serve d'une encre indelebile. Les encres dites a I'aniline sont

a rejeter. Mon regrette coUegue, M. le professeur Bommer, assurait

que les encres Stephens' ' Blue Black ' sont les meilleures pour I'etiquetage

des collections. Je n'ai point a ce sujet d'experience personnelle etendue.

Si le Comity le juge utile, je pourrai lui communiquer ulterieurement

quelques details compldmentaires, ainsi qu'un certain nombre de renseigne-

ments bibliographiques.

Report on the Preservation of Vegetable Specimens for Museums,

              By Professor J. W. H. Trail, M.A., F.E.S.

                                                     Killing.

    All plants or parts intended for museum specimens should be killed

as rapidly as possible, to prevent changes in the preservative fluids or

while being dried. This may be effected by dipping them for a few

minutes into boiling water, or (better) into strong alcohol, cold or hot.
ON PRESERVATION OF PLANTS FOR EXHIBITION.                            693

                            Preservative Media.

--Spirit. I have used this medium for a number of years, usually-

diluted with 30 to 50 per cent, of water. I still employ it, but to a

much less amount, and seldom as the only medium. It serves excellently

after treatment with cupric acetate in suitable cases. Specimens treated

in this way seldom discolour spirit sufficiently to require it to be changed.
I have employed the acid spirit to decolourise specimens that would

otherwise become dark in spirit ; but I seldom now attempt or wish to

obtain bleached preparations. The retention of the more or less natural

colours renders specimens both more pleasing and more instructive.

Formic Aldehyde (Formol).--! have used this for over^two years

with varying results, employing solutions of from 5 to 5 per cent,

in water. Even the weakest solutions have in some cases proved

sufficient when the object  is  small  relatively to  the amount of  the fluid
                                                                                                          ;

but in many cases there appeared a fungus after a few weeks in the weak

solutions. I now employ habitually a 2 per cent, solution, except for

fleshy specimens or where there is relatively little space for the fluid in

the jar owing to the size of the specimen. Under these precautions I

have not found the fungi appear. The colour of the specimens is not

always well preserved, but they are usually superior to specimens treated

with spirit alone in my experience. The 2 per cent, solution has in my

--experience retained the colours best.
     Cupric Acetate and Acetic Acid. I have experimented with the object
of retaining the green colour in preparations in fluids by forming the

compounds of chlorophyll and copper. The results have been very satis-
factory in some cases, notably so in Lycoptoditini and Selaginella, and

good, though with a bluish tinge in the green, in most plants that are

free from tannin. Where tannin is present it combines with the copper
and discolours the specimen ; hence this method does not succeed where it

occurs. The method is as follows : Acetic acid has cupric acetate dis-

solved in it to saturation, and 1 part of the solution is added to 4 of
water, which should have been distilled if not naturally soft. Or 1 part

of acetic acid may be added to 4 of water, and this solution may be

saturated with cupric acetate. In some cases it is sufiicient to employ
1 part of acid in 10 or even more of water. Sometimes one, sometimes

another of these solutions has given the best results, according to the

material to be treated. In each case the treatment is the same. The

specimen, after having been washed clean, is submerged in the solution,
and remains in it for at least a month ; it sufiers no harm even if left a

good deal longer. When it is to be transferred to the permanent pre-

servative fluid it is washed in water, to remove any particles of acetate
from the surface, and is then at once put into its jar in spirit or in what-

ever other fluid is used. Specimens successfully treated in this way may

be exposed to sunlight with impunity. Specimens are apt to become soft

under this treatment.

    The cupric acetate solution may be used again and again, but acetate

should be added occasionally to keep a sufficiently strong solution.

    Brine, Alum Solution, Wickersheimer's Solution, Glycerine (10 to 50

per cent, in water), Barff's Boroglyceride (1 in from 20 to 50 of water),
and Boracic Acid (1 per cent, in water) have all given good results in
some cases. The solutions of the salts are apt to become turbid and to
allow the growth of fungi, especially if any part of the specimens is
uncovered. It is better to wash both the specimens and the vesselg

with an alcoholic solution of mercuric chloride before mounting the speci-
mens for permanent preservation.

     Potassium Acetate, used with the same precaution as to disinfection,
makes a useful medium in some cases in a saturated solution in water.

    Acetic Acid diluted with from 1 to 4 parts water has been used by me

with fair success as a preservative solution for some things.
      \3Iercioric Chloride, \ ounce to one gallon of distilled or soft water,

renewed every year or two, preserves fruits. Glycerine may be added to

bring the fluid to the proper density.
     Salicylic Acid, about 1 ounce to 5 gallons of water, with glycerine added

--in propoi-tion to juiciness of fruits, usually from S to 15 per cent.
     Salicylic Acid. 1 ounce is dissolved in 8 ounces of alcohol, which

is added to 2 gallons of soft or distilled water. Recommended for dark

fruits.

     Zinc Chloride, 2 per cent, dissolved in water and filtered. Recom-
mended for light-coloured and for yellow fruits.

      Siolphurous Acid, 2 ounces of concentrated solution in 1 gallon of soft
or distilled water. Said to be useful, but bleaches some and overcoloui-s
other fruits.

     Sodium Bisulphite, \ ounce, spirit 4 ounces, water 1 gallon. Dissolve
the salt in half a pint of the water, add the rest of the water and the
spirit, and filter.

     Kerosene when pure is said to be good for fruits of Rubus.
     I have not tried the methods within the brackets, owing to want of

facilities while extension of buildings is going on.]

                                    Dry Preparation.

   --For Herbarium. For over twenty years I have employed wire frames,

obtaining the requisite pressure by use of rug-straps or of old and pliant
rope secured over the ends as well as the sides of the bundle. Pressure
suflicient only to prevent shrinkage gives the best results. The wire
frames permit of the easy application of artificial heat, and the results as
to colour of all parts and as to retention of shape have been excellent,

with a minimum of labour in changing papers. Plants that require

specially careful handling and dissections are, of course, treated in thin
sheets of paper, in which they lie till dry, the thin sheets being trans-
ferred unopened to the new sheets in changing the papers.

   --For ' Habit ' and as Museum Specimens. The specimens are exposed

 to dry air without special precautions, or are sometimes secured to prevent

 warping, or hung up in the position most likely to preserve the forms,
 a weight sometimes being suspended from each to prevent distortions in

 drying.

      Some can be treated most satisfactorily by placing them in a box
 prepared with a sliding bottom and a wire partition near it to lay the
 plants on or to support them in it. Fine clean silver sand is then run
 around and between all parts of the specimen, and the box is placed for
 some days in a dry warm place until the plant is dried.

                                    Preparation of Specimens.

       Boiling has proved effective in preserving the natural arrangements of
 protoplasm, &c., in Spirogyra and other microscopic plants ; and it has

 also been resorted to by me with advantage to prevent blackening of the

 tissues in some of the species notoriously apt to become black, both as
 herbarium specimens and in fluid.
ON ^RESERVATIO^" OF PLANTS FOR EXHIBITION.  G95

     I have also resorted to it with advantage in preparing succulent plants
that are difficult to kill and to free of moisture, and also in lessening the
tendency to the fall of the leaves in certain plants, such as Erica.

     [Exposure to Vapour of Chloroform, Ether, or other poisonous gases till
the plants are dead serves the same ends.)

   --Colouring or Staining. I have employed this to bring into greater

clearness the course of the bundles, but not to any great extent. Red or
purplish-red iiowers will retain their colour, or more often be coloured

more brightly than natural, if dipped, before they are pressed, into a
mixture of one part hydrochloric acid in four of spirit.

  --Drying Fungi. I have tried the method devised by Mr. English ; but

my results have not been satisfactory, though the form has in a good

many been fairly well preserved. Hard fungi diy easily and well if exposed

to air in a dry place.

                                 Mounting Preparations.

               Dry Preparations, including Herbarium Specimens,

     Fixing to paper is done with fish-glue. The simplest and quickest

Amethod I find to be as follows :-- sheet of plate glass slightly larger

than the herbarium sheet has a thin layer of glue smeared uniformly over
it. The plant is then laid on this, and is pressed gently. Thus each part
tliat will touch the paper has received a little of the glue, and on the
specimen being laid on the paper it adheres wherever it should do so, and

no other part is smeared. Of course this method is not stiited for weak
plants that could not be lifted without injury. The specimens after
having been glued are placed under pressure for some hours.

      Special dissections, seeds, and other small portions I place in a special
envelope on the sheet, or under a piece of mica or of the gelatine used in
Christmas crackers.

      Preparations in Boxes are also fixed with fish-glue usually, unless the
surface of attachment is very small, in which case they are secured by
threads or wires to the bottom of the box.

   --Preparations in Fluids. Photoxylin has been found to give sufficiently

good results with many small objects, the slight opacity that is apt to

show not being a serious objection to its use. Gelatine is used for larger

 objects.

      Silk Thread has also proved very useful for some kinds of objects,
 allowing them to be easily fixed to mica or glass tablets, or to strips of
 hard paraffin, which do well sometimes. To the paraffin the specimens
 can sometimes be fixed conveniently by the use of a hot rod or wire to
 melt it at the point of contact. I have recently used xylonite for supports,
 but have scarcely had sufficient experience of it to warrant a definite
 conclusion. It appears to do best in solutions of formalin. Black xylonite

 loses its colour in spirit.

                           Poisoning Dry Preparations.

    Mercuric Chloride is the substance of which I make most use for
poisoning herbarium specimens, and also for disinfecting specimens and
jars for fluid preparations. The herbarium specimens are most con-
veniently treated by dipping them into the solution, of the usual strength,
in a shallow earthenware dish, handling them with wooden forceps, and
placing them till quite dry under pressure between sheets of paper.

Carbon Bisulphide is also most useful for fumigating bundles occasionally,
the whole bundle being placed for a day or two in a large trough rendered
air-tight by the usual method, the atmosphere in it being saturated with

the vapour.

                                      Exhibition of Specimens.

     Morphological Preparations and Dissections to illustrate Systematic
Characters, if mounted like hei'barium specimens on stiff paper, and also
ordinary herbarium specimens, can be well exhibited on any available
wall-space by a method that I have used for some time, and that permits
the rapid change of the specimens when desired, they being kept when
not exhibited in the ordinary herbarium cases or in boxes. The sheets to

be exhibited are placed in frames each consisting of a stiff back of card-
board and front of glass, the two being separated by strips of wood, which
in some are | in. and in others only -jfV in- thick. The fourth side (top) is
left open, and through it the sheet is dropped into the space. I use
different sizes of frames, the largest being 17^ in. by 11 in. in surface.

To support the frames strips of wood are fixed against the wall, each
strip being grooved so as to hold the frames both above and below itself,
as shown in the sketches in the margin. The specimens are quite
protected from injury and dust, and are very easily and rapidly inserted
and removed at will.

                                      Vessels for Specimens.

  --Fluid Preparations. For these, after having tried all the various

forms of jars and bottles that I could procure, I prefer the jar in most
cases, and, where the expense is not an insurmountable obstacle, the
rectangular jar with polished front. This is, of course, if the preparation
is to be mounted for permanent preservation. For small objects I
sometimes prefer bottles, either round or flat, as the narrower neck is

more easily secured.

    Dry Preparations I usually place in glass-topped boxes if it is desirable

to protect them specially.

Methods op Sealing.

--Hermetical Sealing. I have employed this method with success for

small objects that can be preserved in fluid or dry in tubes, e.g. some

--Agalls ; but it is suited to only a limited number.
Corks for Bottles and Jars.  coat of paraffin or of collodion helps

a good deal to retard evaporation through corks, while not preventing

their removal when wished.
--Glass Topis. I use these for the jars, the cover and the mouth of the
Ajar both being ground.
                            convenient cement is isinglass dissolved in

acetic acid, heated slightly to render it fit for use. This permits of the

top being readily removed when necessary. It is rendered more secure
by two coats of collodion painted over it when fii'm.

It is convenient to provide for the addition of fluid to replace any lost

by evaporation after a time by having a small hole bored through the
Aglass cover. This hole is closed with a cork.
                                                       more elaborate cement,

composed of gum mastic, isinglass, and acetic acid, with a small admixture

of gum galbanum and gum ammoniac, has proved useful and reliable in

--my experience.
     Labelling. I employ manuscript, type-written, or printed labels, as

may be determined by the advantages in each case, and by the expense.

Section A.--MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE

--President of the Section Professor J. J. Thomson, M.A., D.'Sc, FiR.S.

                  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.

     The President delivered the following Address :

There is a melancholy reminiscence connected with this meeting pf our Section,

Alor when the British Association last met in Liverpool the chair in Section

was occupied hy Clerk-Maxwell. In the quarter of a century which has elapsed
since that meeting, one of the most important advances made in our science has
heen the researches which, inspired hy Maxwell's view of electrical action, con-
firmed that view, and revolutionised our conception of the processes occurring in

the electro-magnetic field. When the Association last met in Liverpool Maxwell's

view was almost without supporters ; to-day its opponents are fewer than its sup-
porters then. Maxwell's theory, which is the development and extension of
Faraday's, has not only aftected our way of regarding the older phenomena of
electricity, it has, in the hands of Hertz and others, led to the discovery of whole
regions of phenomena previously undreamt of. It is sad to think that his prema-
ture death prevented him from reaping the harvest he had sown. His writings
are, however, with us, and are a storehouse to which we continually turn, and
never, I think, without finding something valuable and suggestive.

                                       ' Thus ye teach us day by day,

                                    Wisdom, though now far away.'

The past year has been rich in matters of interest to physicists. In it has

occurred the jubilee of Lord Kelvin's tenure of the Professorship of Natui-al Philo-

sophy at the University of Glasgow. Some of us were privileged to see this year

at Glasgow an event unprecedented in the history of physical science in England,

when congratulations to Lord Kelvin on the jubilee of his professorship were

offered by people of every condition and country Every scientific society and

every scientific man is Lord Kelvin's debtor ; but no society and no body of

men  owe  him  a  greater  debt  than Section 2V of the British Association                                                                                                                                                              he has
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

done more for this Section than any one else, he has rarely missed its meetings, he

has contributed to the Section papers which will make its proceedings imperishable,

and by his enthusiasm he has year by year inspired the workers in this Section to

renew with increased vigour their struggles to penetrate the secrets of Nature.

Long may we continue to receive from him the encouragement and assistance

which have been so freely given for the past half-century.

    By the death of Sir W. R. Grove, the inventor of Grove's cell, we have lost a

physicist whose name is a familiar one in every laboratory in the world. Besides
the Grove cell, we owe to him the discovery of the gas battery, and a series of re-

searches on the electrical behaviour of gases, whose importance is only now beginning

                                           zz2

to be appreciated. His essay on the correlation of the physical forces had great
influence in promoting that belief in the unity of the various branches of physics

which is one of the characteristic features of modem natural philosophy.
     In the late Professor Stoletow, of Moscow, we have lost the author of a series

of most interesting researches on the electrical properties of gases illuminated by

ultra-violet light, researches which, from their place of publication, are, I am afraid,
not so well known in this country as they deserve to be.

     As one who unfortunately of late years has had only too many opportunities of

judging of the teaching of science in our public and secondary schools, I should
like to bear testimony to the great improvement which has taken place in the
teaching of physics in these schools during the past ten years. The standard at^
tained in physics by the pupils of these schools is increasing year by year, and
great credit is due to those by whose labours this improvement has been accom-

plished. I hope I may not be considered ungrateful if I express the opinion that
in the zeal and energy which is now spent in the teaching of physics in schools,
there may lurk a temptation to make the pupils cover too much ground. You
may by careful organisation and arrangement ensure that boys shall be taken over
many branches of physics in the course of a short time ; it is indeed not uncommon

to find boys of 17 or 18 wlio have compassed almost the whole range of physical

subjects. But although you may increase the rate at which information is ac-

quired, you cannot increase in anything like the same proportion the rate at which
the subject is assimilated, so as to become a means of strengthening the mind and
a permanent mental endowment when the facts have long been forgotten.

      Physics can be taught so as to be a subject of the greatest possible educational

value, but when it is so it is not so much because the student acquires a knowledge
of a number of interesting and important facts, as by the mental training the study
artbrda in, as Maxwell said, * bringing our theoretical Icnowledge to bear on the
objects and the objects on our theoretical knowledge.' I think this training can be
got better by going very slowly through such a subject as mechanics, making the
students try innumerable experiments of the simplest and, what is a matter of im-

portance in school teaching, of the most inexpensive kind, but always endeavouring
to arrive at numerical results, rather than by attempting to cover the whole range
of mechanics, light, heat, sound, electricity, and magnetism. I confess I regret the

presence in examinations intended for school boys of many of these subjects.

      I think, too, that in the teaching of physics at our universities there is perhaps

a tendency to make the course too complex and too complete. I refer especially
to the training of those students who intend to become physicists. I think that

after a student has been trained to take accurate observations, to be alive to those

pitfalls and errors to which all experiments are liable, mischief may in some cases

be done if, with the view of learning a knowledge of methods, he is kept perform-
ing elaborate experiments, the results of which are well known. It is not given to

many to wear a load of learning lightly as a flower. With many students a load

of learning, especially if it takes a long time to acquire, is apt to crush enthusiasm.

Now, there is, I think, hardly any quality more essential to success in physical
investigations than enthusiasm. Any investigation in experimental physics
requires a large expenditure of both time and patience ; the apparatus seldom,
if ever, begins by behaving as it ought ; there are times when all the forces of
nature, all the properties of matter, seem to be fighting against us: the instruments
behave in the most capricious way, and we appreciate Coutts Trotter's saying, that
the doctrine of the constancy of nature could never have been discovered in a labora-
tory. These difficulties have to be overcome, but it may take weeks or months to do

so, and, unless the student is enthusiastic, he is apt to retire disheartened from the

contest. I think, therefore, that the preservation of youthful enthusiasm is one of

mythe most important points for consideration in the training of physicists. In

opinion this can best be done by allowing the student, even before he is supposed
to be acquainted with the whole of physics, to begin some original research of a

simple kind under the guidance of a teacher who will encourage him and assist in

the removal of difficulties. If the student once tastes the delights of the successful
completion of an investigation, be is not likely to go back, and will be better

equipped for investigating the secrets of nature than if, like the White Knight of

' Alice in Wonderland,' he commences his career knowing how to, measure

or weigh every physical quantity under the sun, hut with little desire or

enthusiasm to have anything to do with any of them. Even for those students

who intend to devote themselves to other pursuits than physical investigation, the

henefits dei'ived from original investigation as a means of general education can

haidly he over-estimated ; the necessity it entails of independent thought, perseve-

rance in overcoming difficulties, and the weighing of evidence gives it an educational

Wevalue which can hardly be rivalled.                         have to congratulate ourselves that

through the munificence of Mr. Ludwig Mond, in providing and endowing a labora-

tory for research, the opportunities for pursuing original investigations in this country

have been greatly increased.

    The discovery at the end of last year by Professor Rontgen of a new kind of

radiation from a highly exhausted tube thi-ough which an electric discharge is

passing has aroused an amount of interest unprecedented in the history of physical

science. The elfects produced inside such a tube by the cathode rays, the

bright phosphorescence of the glass, the shadows thrown hy opaque objects, the

deflection of the I'ays by a magnet, have, thanks to the researches of Crookes and

Goldstein, long been lamiliar to us, but it is only recently that the remarkable

etiects wliich occur outside such a tube have been discovered. In 1 893 Lenard,

using a tube provided with a window made of a very thin plate of aluminium,

found that a screen impregnated with a solution of a phosphorescent substance

hecame luminous if placed outside the tube in the prolongation of the line from the

cathode through the aluminium window. He also found that photographic plates

placed outside the tube in th is line were affected, and electrified bodies were discharged

he also obtained by these rays photographs through plates of aluminium or quartz.

He foimd that the rays were affected by a magnet, and regarded them as the pro-

longations of the cathode rays. This discovery was at the end of last year followed
by that of Rontgen, who found that the region round the discharge tube is traversed

by rays which affect a photographic plate after passing through substances

such as aluminium or cardboard, which are opaque to ordinary light ; which pass

from one substance to another, without any refraction, and with but little regular

Wereflection ; and which are not affected by a magnet.        may, I think, for the

purposes of discussion, conveniently divide the rays occurring in or near a vacuum

tube traversed hy an electric current into three classes, without thereby implying

Wethat they are necessarily distinctly different in physical character.                                                                                                                                                                                                             have (1)

rays outside the tube, which are also deflected by a magnet ; and (3) the Rontgen

rays, which are not, as far as is known, deflected by a magnet. Two views are held

as  to  the  nature  of the cathode  rays                     one view is, that they are particles of gae
                                                           ;

carrying charges of negative electricity, and moving with great velocities which

they have acquired as they travelled through the intense electric field which exists

in the neighbourhood of the negative electrode. The phosphorescence of the glass

is on this view produced by the impact of these rapidly moving charged particles,

though whether it is produced by the mechanical violence of the impact, or whether

--it is due to an electro-magnetic impulse produced bv the sudden reversal of the

velocity of the negatively charged particle whether, in fact, it is due to mechanical

or electrical causes, is an open question. This view of the constitution of the

cathode rays explains in a simple way the deflection of those rays in a magnetic

field, and it has lately received strong confirmation from the results of an experiment

made by Perriu. Perrin placed inside the exhausted tube a cylindrical metal

vessel with a small hole in it, and connected this cylinder with the leaves of a gold-
leaf electroscope. The cathode rays could, by means of a magnet, be guided so as

either to pass into the cylinder through the aperture, or turned quite away from it.
Perrin found that when the cathode rays passed into the cylinder the gold leaf of

the electroscope diverged, and had a negative charge, showing that the bundle of

cathode rays enclosed by the cylinder had a charge of negative electricity. Crookes

had many years ago exposed a disc connected with a gold-leaf electroscope to -.the

bombsirdment of the cathode rays, and found that the disc received a slight />o««<tVie

chargfe ; with tlvis arrangement, however, the charged particles had to give up tiieir

charges to the' disc if the gold leaves of the electroscope were to be aftected, and we'

know that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get electricity out of a

charged gas m^rfely by Ijringing the gas in contact with a metal. Lord" Kelvin's

electric strainers are an example of this. It is a feature of Perrin's experiment

that since it acts by induction the indications of the electroscope are independent

of the communication of the charges of electricity from the gas to the cylinder, and

since the cathode rays fall on the inside of the cylinder the electroscope would

not be affected, even if there were such an effect as is produced when ultra-violet

light_ falls upon the surface of an electro-negative metal when the metal acquires a

positive charge. Suiceany such process cannot affect the total amount of electricity

inside the cylinder, it will not affect the gold leaves of the electroscope; in fact,

Perrin's experiments prove that the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity.

    The other view held as to the constitution of the cathode rays is that they are

waves in the ether. It would seem difficult to account for the result of Perrin's

experiment on this view, and also I think verj' difficult to account for the magnetic

deflection of the rays. Let us take the case of a uniform magnetic field: the

experiments which have been made on the magnetic deflection of these rays seem^
to make it clear that in a magnetic field which is sensibly uniform, the path of

these rays is curved                                                                              now if these  rays were  due to ether waves, the curvature of
                                                                                               ;

the path would show that the velocity of propagation of these waves varied from

point to point of the path. That is, the velocity of propagation of these waves is

not only afiected by the magnetic field, it is affected differently at different parts

of the field.. But in a uniform field what is there to differentiate one part

from another; 'f;o as to account for the variability of the velocity of wave

propagation in such a field P The curvature of the path in a uniform field

could not be accounted for by supposing that the velocity of this wave motion

depended on the strength of the magnetic field, or that the magnetic field,

by distorting the shape of the boundary of the negative dark space, changed

the direction of the wave front, and so produced a deflection of the rays. The

chief reason for supposing that the cathode rays are a species of wave motion is

afforded by Lenard's discovery, that when the cathode rays in a vacuum tube fall

on a thin aluminium window in the tube, rays having similar properties are

observed on the side of the window outside the tube : this is readily explained on

the hypothesis that the rays are a species of wave motion to which "the window is

partially transparent, while it is not very likely that particles of the gas in the

tube could ftjrce their way through a piece of metal. This discovery of Lenard'.'^

does not, however, seem to me incompatible with the view that the cathode rays are

due to negatively charged particles moving with high velocities. The space outside

Lenard's tube TOTist have been traversed by Eontgen rays : these would put the

surrounding gas in a state in which a current would be readily started in the gas if
any electromotive force acted upon it. Now, though the metal window in Lenard's

experiments Vs^as connected with the earth, and would, therefore, screen off' from the

outside of the tflbe any effect arising from slow electrostatic changes in the tube, it

does not follow that it would be able to screen off' the electrostatic effect of charged

particles moving to and from the tube with veiy great rapidity. For in order to

screen off' electrostatic effects, there must be a definitedistribution of electrification

over the screen : changes in this distribution, however, take a finite time, which

depends upon the dimensions of the screen and the electrical conductivity of the

material of which it is made. If the electrical changes in the tube take place at

above a certain rate, the distribution of electricity on the screen will not have time

to adjust itself, and the screen will cease to shield ofl' all electrostatic effects. Thus

the very rapid electrical changes which would take place if rapidly moving charged

mbodies were striking against the window might give rise to electromotive forces
     the region outside the window, and produce conA'ection currents in the gas
which has been made a conductor by the Rontgen rays. The Lenard rays would

thus be analogous in character to the cathode rays, both being convective currents

of electricity. Though there are some points in the behaviour of these Lenard rays

which do not admit of a very ready explanation from this point of view, yet the

difficulties in its way seem to me considerably less than that of supposing that a
wave in the ether can change its velocity when moving from point to point in a

uniform magnetic field.
WeI now pass on to the consideration of the Rontgeu rays.

acquainted Avith any crucial experiment which shows unmistakably that these rays

are waves of transverse vibration in the ether, or that they are waves of normal

vibration, or indeed that they are vibrations at all. As a working hypothesis, how-

ever, it may be worth while considering the question whether there is any property

known to be possessed by these rays which is not possessed by some form or other

of hght. The many forms of light have in the last few months received a note-

worthy addition by the discovery of M. Becquerel of an invisible radiation, possess-

means of this radiation, which, since it can be polarised, is unquestionably light,

photographs through opaque substances similar to, thougjh not so beautiful as, those

obtained by means of Rontgen rays can be taken, and, like the Rontgen rays, they

cause an electrified body on which they shine to lose its charge, whether this be

positive or negative.

The two respects in which the Rontgen rays differ from light is in the

absence of refraction and perhaps of polarisation. Let us consider the absence

Weof refraction first.     know cases in which special rays of the spectrum pass

from one substance to another without refraction; for example, Kundt showed

that gold, silver, copper, allow some rays to pass through them without bending,

while other rays are bent in the wrong direction. Pfliiger has lately found that

the same is true for some of the aniline dyes when in a solid form. In addition to
this, the theory of dispersion of light shows' that there will be no bending when the

frequency of the vibration is vei^ great. 1 have here a curve, taken from a paper

by Helmholtz, which shows the relation between the refractive index and the

frequency of vibration for a substance whose molecules have a natural period of
OKvibration, and one only ; the frequency of this vibration is represented by
                                                                               in the

diagram. The refractive index increases with the frequency of the light until the

latter is equal to the frequency of the natural vibration of the substance ; the

refractive index then diminishes, becomes less than unity, and finally approaches

unity, and is practically equal to it when the frequency of the light greatly exceeds

that of the natural vibration of the molecule. Helmholtz's results are obtained on

the supposition that a molecule of the refracting substance consists of a pair of

oppositely electrified atoms, and that the specific inductive capacity of the medium

consist«of two parts, one due to the ether, the other to the setting of the molecules

along the lines of electric force.

    Starting from this supposition we can easily see vrithout mathematical analysis'

that the relation between the refractive index and the frequency must be of the
kind indicated by the curve. Let us suppose that an electromotive force of given
amplitude acts on this mixture of molecules and ether, and let us start with the fre-
quency of the external electromotive force less than that of the free vibrations of the
molecules : as the period of the force approaches that of the molecules, the effect of

the force in pulling the molecules into line will increase ; thus the specific inductive
capacity, and therefore the refractive index, increases with the frequency of the
external force ; the effect of the force on the orientation of the molecules will be

greatest when the period of the force coincides with that of the molecules. As

long as the frequency of the force is less than that of the molecules, the external

field tends to make the molecules set so as to increase the specific inductive capacity

of the mixture ; as soon, however, as the frequency of the force exceeds that of the
molecules, the molecules, if there are no viscous forces, will all topple over and

point so as to make the part of the specific inductive capacity due to the molecules
of opposite sign to that due to the ether. Thus, for frequencies greater than that

of the molecules, the specific inductive capacity will be less than unity. When the

frequency of the force only slightly exceeds that of the molecules, the effect of the

external field on the molecules is very great, so that if there are a considerable
number of molecules, the negative part of the specific inductive capacity due to the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

molecules may be greater than the positive part due to the ether, so that the

speciWc inductive capacity of the mixture of molecules and ether would be negative
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

--no waves of this period could then travel through the medium they would be

totally reflected from the surface.

As the frequency of the force gets greater and greater, ite effect in making the

molecules set will get less and less, but the waves will continue to be totally re-

flected until the neo-ative part of the specific inductive capacity due to the mole-

cules is just equal to the positive part due to the ether. Here the refractive

index of the mixture is zero. As the frequency of the force increases, its effect on

the molecules gets less and less, so that the specific inductive capacity continually

approaches that due to the ether alone, and practically coincides with it as soon as

the frequency of the force is a considerable multiple of that of the molecules. In

this case both the specific inductive capacity and the refractive index of the medium

are the same as that of the ether, and there is consequently no refraction. Thus

the absence of refraction, instead of being in contradiction to the Rontgen rays,

being a kind of light, is exactly what we should expect if the wave-length of the

light were exceedingly small.

The other objection to these rays being a kind of light is, that there is no very

conclusive evidence of the existence of polarisation. Numerous experiments have

been made on the difference between the absorption of these rays by a pair of

tourmaline plates when their axes are crossed or parallel. Many observers have

failed to observe any difference at all between the absorption in the two cases.

Prince Galitziue and M. de Karnojitsky, by a kind of cumulative method, have

obtained photographs which seem to show that there is a slightly greater absorption

when the axes are crossed than there is when the axes are parallel. There can,

however, be no question that the effect, if it exists at all, is exceedingly small

compared with the corresponding efl"ect for visible light. Analogy, however, leads

us to expect that to get polarisation effects we must use, in the case of short

waves, polarisers of a much finer structure than would be necessary for long ones.

Thus a wire bird-cage will polarise long electrical waves, but will have no effect

on visible light. Rubens and Du Bois made an instrument which would polarise

the infra red rays by winding very fine wires very close together on a framework

this arrangement, however, was too coarse to polarise visible light. Thus, though

the structure of the tourmaline is fine enough to polarise the visible rays, it may

be much too coarse to polarise the Rontgen rays if these have exceedingly small

wave-lengths. As far as our knowledge of these rays extends, I think we may

say that though there is no direct evidence that they are a kind of light, there are

no properties of the rays which are not possessed by some variety of light.

It is clear that if the Rontgen rays are light rays, their wave-lengths are of an

entirely different order from those of visible light. It is perhaps worth notice that

on the electro-magnetic theory of light we might expect two different types of

A'ibration if we suppose that the atoms in the molecule of the vibrating substance

carried electrical charges. One set of vibrations would be due to the oscillations

of the bodies carrying the charges, the other set to the oscillation of the charges

on these bodies. The wave-length of the second set of vibrations would be com-

mensurate with molecular dimensions ; can these vibrations be the Rontgen rays ?

If so, we should expect them to be damped with such rapidity as to resemble

electrical impulses rather than sustained vibrations.

If we turn from the rays themselves to the eft'ects they produce, we find that

the rays alter the properties of the substances through which they are passing.

This change is most apparent in the effects produced on the electrical properties

Aof the substances.  gas, for example, while transmitting these rays is a con-

ductor of electricity. It retains its conducting properties for some little time

after the rays have ceased to pass through it ; but Mr. Rutherford and I have

lately found that the conductivity is destroyed if a current of electricity is sent

through the Rbntgenised gas. The gas in this state behaves in this respect like

a very dilute solution of an electrolyte. Such a solution would cease to conduct

after enough electricity had been sent through it to electrolyse all the molecules

of the electrolyte. When a current is passing through a gas exposed to the rays^
T1{ANSACT10^S OK SECTION A.  705,

the cunent destroys and the rays produce the structure which gives conductivity
to the gas ; when things have reached a steady state the rate of destruction by the
current must equal the rate of production hy the rays. The current can thus not
exceed a definite value, otherwise more of the conducting gas would be destroyed
than is produced.

      This explains the very characteristic feature that in the passage of electricity
through gases exposed to Rontgen rays the current, though at first proportional
to the electromotive force, soon reaches a value where it is almost constant and

independent of the electromotive force, and we get to a state when a tenfold

increase in the electromotive force only increases the current by a few per cent.
The conductivity under the Rontgen rays varies greatly from one gas to another,
the halogens and their gaseous compounds, the compounds of sulphur, and mercury
vapour, are among the best conductors. It is worthy of note that those gases

which are the best conductors when exposed to the rays are either elements, or
compounds of elements, which have in comparison with their valency very high

refractive indices.

     The conductivity conferred by the rays on a gas is not destroyed by a con-

siderable rise in temperature ; it is, for example, not destroyed if it be sucked

through metal tubing raised to a red heat. The conductivity is, however, de-
stroyed if the gas is made to bubble through water ; it is also destroyed if the gas
is forced through a plug of glass wool. This last effect seems to indicate that the
structure which confers conductivity on the gas is of a very coarse kind, and we
get confirmation of this from the fact that a very thin layer of gas exposed to the
Rontgen rays does not conduct nearly so well as a thicker one. I think we have

--evidence from other sources that electrical conduction is a process that requires

a considerable space a space large enough to inclose a very large number of

molecules.

     Thus Roller found that the specific resi.stauces of petroleum, turpentine,
and distilled water, when determined from experiments made witi very thin
layers of these substances, were very much larger than when determined from ex-
periments with thicker layers. Even in the case of metals there is evidence that
the metal has to be of appreciable size if it is to conduct electricity. The theory

of the scattering of light by small particles shows that, if we assume the truth

of the electro-magnetic theory of light, the effects should be different according

as the small particles are insulators or conductors. When the small particles are

non-conductors, theorv and experiment concur in showing that the direction of
complete polarisation for the scattered light is at right angles to the direction of
the incident light, while if the small particles are conductors, theory indicates
that the direction of complete polarisation makes an angle of 60° with the
incident light. This result is not, liowever, confirmed by the experiments made
by Professor Threlfall on the scattering of light by very small particles of gold.

He found that the gold scattered the light in just the same way as a non-

conductor, giving complete polarisation at right angles to the incident light.
This would seem to indicate that those very finely divided metallic particles no
longer acted as conductors. Thus there seems evidence that in the case of con-
duction through gases, througli badly conducting liquids, and through metals,
electric conduction is a process which requires a very considerable space and
aggregations of large numbers of mole'-ules. I have not been able to find any
direct experimental evidence as to whether the same is true for electrolytes.
Experiments on the resistance of thin layers of electrolytes would be of con-
siderable interest, as according to one widely accepted view of electrolysis con-
duction througli electrolytes, so far from being effected by aggregations of
molecules, takes place by means of the ion, a structure simpler than that of
the molecule, so that if this represents the process of electrolytic conduction,
there would not seem room for the occurrence of an effect which occurs with every
other kind of conduction.

     In this building it is only fitting that some reference should be made to the

question of the movement of the ether. You are all doubtless acquainted with the
heroic attempts made by Professor Lodge to set the ether in motion, and how sue-
706 . KEPORT-- 1896.

cessfully the ether- resisted them. It seems to be conclusively proved that a solid

body in motion does not set in motion the ether at an appreciable distance outside

it ; so that if the ether is disturbed at all in such a case, the disturbance is not com-

parable with that produced by a solid moving through an incompressible fluid, but

must be more analogous to that which would be produced by the motion through,

the liquid of a body of very open structure, such as a piece of wire netting, where

the motion of the fluid only extends to a distance comparable with the diameter of

the wire, and not with that of the piece of netting. There is another class of

phenomena relating to the movement of the ether which is, I think, deserving of

consideration, and that is the eflect of a varying electro-magnetic field in setting

the ether in motion. 1 do not remember to have seen it pointed out that the

electro-magnetic theory of light implicitly assumes that the ether is not set in

motion even when acted on by mechanical forces. On the electro-magnetic theory

of light such forces do exist, and the equations used are only applicable when the

ether is at rest. Consider, for example, the case of a plane electric wave travelling

Wethrough the ether.  have parallel to the wave front a varying electric polari-

sation, which on the theory is equivalent to a current ; at right angles to this, and

also in the wave-front, we have a magnetic force. Now, when a current flows

through a medium in a magnetic field there is a force acting on the medium at

right angles to the plane, which is parallel both to the current and to the magnetic

force ; there will thus be a mechanical force acting on each unit volume of the

ether when transmitting an electric wave, and since this force is at right angles to

the current and to the magnetic force, it will be in the direction in which the

wave is propagated. In the electro-magnetic theory of light, however, we assume

that this force does not set the ether in motion, as unless we made this assumption

we should have to modify our equations, as the electro-magnetic equations are not

the same in a moving field as in a field at rest. In fact, a complete discussion of

the transmission of electro-magnetic disturbances requires a knowledge of the con-

stitution of the ether, which we do not possess, ^^'e now assume that the ether is

not set in motion by an electro-magnetic wave. If we do not make this assump-

tion we must introduce into our equation quantities representing the components

of the velocity of the ether, and unless we know the constitution of the ether, so

as to be able to deduce these velocities from the forces acting on it, there will be

in the equations of the electro-magnetic field more unknown quantities than we

have equations to determine. It is, therefore, a very essential point in electro-

magnetic theory to investigate whether or not there is any motion of the ether in

Wea varying electro-magnetic field.  have at the Cavendish Laboratory, using

Professor Lodge's arrangement of interference fringes, made some experiments to

see if we could detect any movement of the ether in the neighbourhood of an

electric vibrator, using the spark which starts the vibrations as the source of light.

The movement of the ether, if it exists, will be oscillatory, and with an undamped

vibrator the average velocity would be zero ; we used, therefore, a heavily damped

vibrator, mth which the average velocity might be expected to be finite. The
Weexperiments are not complete, but so far the results are entirely negative.
                                                                               also

tried by the same method to see if we could detect any movement of the ether in

the neighbourhood of a vacuum-tube emitting Eontgen rays, but could not find any

trace of such a movement. Professor Threlfall, who independently tried the same

experiment, has, I believe, arrived at the same conclusion.

Unless the ether is immovable under the mechanical forces in a varying electro-

magnetic field, there are a multitude of phenomena awaiting discovery. If the

ether does move, then the velocity of transmission of electrical vibrations, and

therefore of light, will be affected by a steady magnetic field. Such a field, even if

containing nothing but ether, will behave towards light like a crystal, and the

Avelocity of propagation will depend upon the direction of the rays.  similar

Weresult would also hold in a steady electric field.  may hope that experiments

on these and similar points may throw somo light on the properties of tbat medium,

which is universal, which plays so large a part in our explanation of physical

phenomena, and of which we know so little.

2. On the Evolntion of Stellar Systems. By Isaac Roberts, D.Sc, F.R.S.

The evidence of stellar evolution which it is now proposed to suhmit may be
--presented in either of two forms : (1 ) By tracmg back from the visually finished
                                   they may have  been         up               this we  may term
stars to the  material  of  which                       built                ;

the analytical method. (2) By tracing their development from an amorphous

material to the visually finished stars ; this would be the synthetical method. The

first of these will now be considered.

It should be noted that the evidence has been obtained by processes which are

not subject to the disturbing influence of human or personal imperfections.

A series of photographs, untouched by handwork, were shown, and the objects

as they undoubtedly exist in the sky were thus submitted to judgment.

A small selection of characteristic photographs were exhibited by lantern

projections on a screen.
     The first was a photograph of the sky in the constellation Auriga, which was

taken with an exposure of the plate during 90 minutes, and attention was drawn
to the remarkable groups, curves, and lines of stars which were clearly shown

upon it. Some of them are constituted of bright stars of nearly equal magnitude
some are of faint stars, also of nearly equal magnitude ; some are of both bright
and faint stars, and there is much regularity in the spacing distance between the
stars in the several groups. These appearances are persistently found upon all

photographs, taken with a long exposure, in any part of the sky where the stars

are numerous.

     In order to emphasise these statements, two photographs of stars in the con-
stellation Argo and one in Cassiopeia were shown on the screen, and upon them

also was seen the appearances referred to ; and hundreds of photographs of other

regions of the sky could be shown in further confirmation of these features.
     The explanation oftered to account for the grouping of the stars, that they were

so placed from the beginning, is not the only one. Photographs were then shown

which suggest, if they do not demonstrate, stellar evolution.
     The spiral nebula in Pisces clearly shows that the spirals consist of nebulous

matter with faint stars immersed in it, and of bright stars apparently in their
completed forms. The curvatures and the general arrangements of these stars,
lx)th bright and faint, can be readily matched with similar curves seen on the
photographs already shown ; but the taint stars which are immersed in the nebu-

losity are not yet in the completed form, and will not arrive at that stage until

the whole of the nebulosity has been absorbed, when they will stand out clearly

separated like the other stars.

     The spiral nebula in the constellation Ursa Major, like the last, has spirals
formed of nebulous matter, with numerous starlike condensations in it ; and six
well-defined stars are involved at irregular intervals. The nebulous condensations
are not so regular in their outlines as are those on the first photograph, and are

suggestive of a more recent period in their development.
     The spiral nebula in Ui-sa Major, like the two others, consists of faint starlike

condensations immersed in the convolutions. There are also five well-formed

stars involved, but the stellar condensations are less fully developed in this nebula.

     The fourth photograph was of the spiral nebula in Canes Venatici, and it was
observed that the convolutions are more strongly shown in this than in the other

nebulae ; also that they consist of several well-formed stars, whilst the star-like

condensations show various degrees of development, from the likeness of a nebulous

star to that of diffused nebulosity.

     The fifth photograph, the spiral nebula in Triangulum, shows the spirals to be

crowded with stars and star-like condensations in the midst of difi"used nebulosity.

708,                          KEPORT-- 1896,

The convolutions are less symmetrical in their outlines than are those of the other

spirals exhibited.

     The evidence, part of which had been laid before the Section, is reasonably
conclusive that some, if not many, of the stars which we see in curves and in
groups strewn over the sky have been formed in the manner pointed out. There
are, besides this, other methods of stellar evolution, shown in other photographs,

--such as condensations into stars of nebulae which have not at present symmetrical

structures and outlines of globular nebulae and of annular nebulae ; but these
were not described.

If it he true that stars are evolved from spiral and other forms of nebulosity,

Weit may be asked, Whence came the nebulous matter ?  can answer with conti-

dence that it exists in very large quantities over extensive areas, and in many parts

of the sky ; and that it exists there in the form of gas, or, more probably, as

Professor Norman Lockyer urges, in his ' Meteoritic Hypothesis,' of meteors or

meteoric dust.

     There is also evidence that collisions between bodies in space take place

perhaps large bodies may collide, with the result that their component materials

would again be converted into gas, meteoric dust, and meteoric stones. What-

ever the sources of the nebular material may be, we know that collisions in space

would supply the energy requisite for the formation of the spiral nebulae, of the

existence and the forms of which now we have ample proof.

where C is a constant. The function Q. is given by

where >·, p are the heliocentric and jovicentric radii vectores.

    The curves defined by 2fi = C give a partition of space into regions where the

velocity is real, and those where it is imaginary.

    From these curves are obtained an inferior limit to the heliocentric distance of

a superior planet, and superior limits to the heliocentric and jovicentric distances
of an inferior planet and of a satellite.

     There are four critical cases, corresponding to the four exact solutions of the

problem, in which the three bodies move round without relative motion.
     Solutions of these equations, which are represented by closed curves, are called

periodic orbits, and if they are re-entrant after a single circuit, they are called
simply periodic orbits.

     The object in view is to obtain a complete synopsis of simply periodic orbits,
and of their stabilities, for all values of C. This can only be done in a concrete
case, and the sun's mass is taken as ten times that of Jove, and the orbits are
determined by the method of quadratures.

     The field to be covered is so large that up to the present time it has been
found necessary to pass over the retrograde orbits and the superior planets ; and
only a portion of the cases of inferior planets and satellites have been as yet

considered. A number of .figures were shown, amongst which may be mentioned

some exLibiting orbits of oscillating satellites, and orbits with cusps and loops.

Perhaps the most curious cases are those representing the orbits of satellites, which

present three new moons in a month, and another with five full moons in a month.

The consideration of the stability of the orbits shows that there are stable

satellites close to Jove, or at some distance from Jove; but that there is a tract

between these two in which no stable motion can take place. This conclusion

appears to throw some light ou Bode's empirical law as to the distribution of

planets and satellites.

A paper containing an account of this investigation will appear in the Acta

Mathematica of Stockholm.  _.

1. On Cathode Rays and their j)robahle connection vnth Rontgen Rays.
                  By Professor Philipp Lenakd, Aachen.

Until a few years ago it was impossible to make experiments on cathode rays

under modified conditions, because it was impossible to vary their surroundings

without at the same time altering the circumstances under which they were pro-

duced. Hertz's discovery that thin sheets of metals were transparent to the

cathode rays has enlarged the field of experiment. By making a small aluminium

window in one end of the discharge-tube the rays can now be allowed to go out

from the space where     they were generated                                                                                 they can thus be investigated without
                                                                                                                          ;

altering the conditions of generation, and therewith the properties of the rays

themselves. The cathode rays emerge into air at ordinary pressure, but they are

very rapidly absorbed by it, so that at a distance of from 6 to 8 centimetres no

trace of them is visible on a screen capable of phosphorescence. The free atmo-

sphere proves, moreover, to be a turbid medium to these rays, their propagation

behind shadow-casting objects being similar to the propagation of light in milk.

Other gases of equal density behave in the same way. But as the density of a gas

is diminished by lowering its pressure, it becomes more transparent and less

turbid. In the highest vacuum that can be produced th«re is no limit to the

transmission of the rays, and behind a diaphragm they are quite as sharp as rays

of light are under the same circumstances. From the fact that the rays are not

stopped by a space containing only minute traces of matter it is concluded that

they are processes going on in the ether.

The absorption of the rays in various substances can also be investigated. It

is found to be in every case approximately proportional to the density of the

medium, whether this be solid or gaseous, and whatever be its chemical nature.

The rays are deflected by a magnet, and it was found that in this respect there

were different kinds of cathode rays, those which are produced when the dis-

charge-tube was more exhausted being less deilectible than those produced when

it was less exhausted. The deflectibility of the rays depends also in other respects

on the circumstances of their production ; it is, however, quite unalterable by any
change in the observing-space. Whatever the nature or the pressure of the gas in

this space was, the deflectibility of the rays remained the same whenever it could

be tested i.e. whenever the density of the gas was such as allowed rays of some

sharpness to be obtained. This was the case, for instance, in common air below

about one tenth of an atmosphere, and in hydrogen of ordinary or any smaller

pressure. The deflectibility of the rays was also found to be the same before and

after traversing an air-tight sheet of aluminium set up in the observing-space.

     The deflectibility of a cathode ray once produced being thus quite unalterable,
its magnitude may serve as a characteristic to denote any particular kind of cathode

ray. Rays of smaller deflectibility were found to be less easily absorbed and

diifused by all substances than rays of greater deflectibility. It might therefore
be expected that there exists an extreme form of cathode rays which is not per-
ceptibly deflected by a magnet, and which is accordingly very slightly absorbed
nnd diffused by all substances, but which would have the same property of being
absorbed by all substances approximately in proportion to their density. The rays
discovered by Rontgen agree in these respects with such cathode rays ; they agree
with them also in other respects, and, in fact, no observation yet made contradicts
the hypothesis that the Rontgen rays are of the same nature as the cathode rays,
being an extreme form of cathode ray with zero deflectibility.

3. On the Transpareyicti of Glass and PorcJitin to the Rontgen Rays.
            By A. W. RiJCKER, F.R.S., and W. Watson, B.Sc.

     The transparency to the X-rays of a number of difterent pieces of the same

kind of glass up to a total thickness of 5'1 mm. was determined by the photometric

method.

     The results can be expressed very approximately by the formula
                                        I = I,,{0-2 + 0-8xO-.35794,},

where I,, is the intensity of the phosphorescent light when no absorbing medium is
interposed, and I the intensity when the X-rays have passed through t mm. of the
glass used. This suggests that the rays emitted by the tube consist of two great

groups, to one of which the glass is very transparent, while the remainder are
absorbed according to the ordinary law.

     Observations were then made on the ratio between the transparency of dififerent
kinds of porcelain to that of glass of the same thickness. The specimens were in
part lent by the authorities of the South Kensington Museiim, and were in part
selected from a small collection belonging to one of the authors.

     The mean results were as follows :

(5) a five-fall Sprengel pump, by means of which the density of the air inside the
tube could be reduced to any desired extent. The galvanometer was placed on a

block of paraffin between one terminal of the electric machine aiid one terminal of

the glass tube. Its deflections were read by a telescope and its sensibility was

arranged by external magnets, so that one division of deflection corresponded to

0*3 mikroampei'e. Our method of experimenting was to keep the density of the

air constant while we varied the difierence of potential between the terminals of

the tube, and taking simultaneous readings on the voltmeter and on the galvano-

meter. The electric potential was varied either by varying the speed of rotation

of the machine or by varying the distance between the needle-point terminals of

the machine, or by a combination of both.

   We found that at ordinary atmospheric density it requires a diflerence of

potential of between 2,000 and 3,000 volts at the terminals of the tulje before the

galvanometer indicates any current. As the difference of potential is now increased,

the current through the galvanometer increases at a greater ratio, so that if a curve

be drawn with difterences of potential as abscisssi and galvanometer readings or

currents as ordinates, the curve is always concave towards the axis of current.

Through this particular tube the currents at 3,000, 5,000, and 8,000 volts diiference

of potential were 7"2, 17'6, and 63'2 mikroamperes respectively. As the density of

the air was diminished, the difference of potential necessary to start a current, as

indicated by the galvanometer, gradually diminished also, till, at a density of about

rxhiJS of t'l*^ ordinary density, a few score volts were sufficient to start a current.
For the same difference of potential the current increased as the density of the air

diminished ; or, otherwise, the same current was obtained by smaller differences of

potential as the density of the air was reduced. Tims a current of about 56

mikroamperes was obtained by differences of potential of 7,400, 1,090, 700, 370,
405, 570 volts, when the densities of the air were 1 (ordinary density), 0'058,

0093, 0-0007, 0-00006, 0-000024 respectively; or, otherwise, when the air

pressures were 750, 44, 7, j, tjV, ^V millimetres of mercury respectively.

    As the air density was still further reduced, the difference of potential necessary

to start a current increased, and the current for the same difference of potential

diminished. Thus, when the density of the air was reduced to one five-millionth

of the density of air at ordinary atmospheric pressure and temperature, differences

of potential of 3,000, 5,000, and 8,000 volts gave currents of 1-3, 4-4, and 14-6

mikroamperes respectively.

' If a curve be drawn for a constant difference of potential, with air densities as

abscissae and currents as ordinates, we find the curve rising as the air density is

diminished to about j^j, or xs'cjtf of ordinary density ; then falling again as the
density is still further reduced to about a five-millionth of ordinary density. This

is the lowest density we have experimented with, but we havQ no reason to doubt
that at very much lower densities we would still be able to get measurable currents

through the tube.

We Hare now experimenting with a tube 13 cms. long and  cm. diameter,

having ball terminals of ^ cm. diameter and about 2 mm. apart. The investigation

is not complete enough for publishing any results.

                  5. The Duration of X-Radiation at each Spark.

                        By Fred. T. Trouton, M.A., D.Sc.

    The object of these experiments was to ascertain how long a Crookes' tube

continued at each spark to give out, Rontgen radiation.
     The method adopted was to rotate a metallic-toothed wheel (cut out of sheet

zinc) interposed between a tube and a sensitive photographic plate. Only one spark
is allowed to pass by making one brake of the primary of the inductive coil used.
The departure from sharpness of outline of the image of the moving teeth on
712 REPORT-- 1896.

development ia observed and measured in terms of the width of a tooth. If the
speed of rotation is known, the length of time the effective radiation persists can
be at once deduced.

   A mercury brake worked simply by hand was generally used. The tube was

distant from the plate about eight centimetres.

    When the wheel is rotated sufficiently fast, a drawing out of the image is

always observed ; but the amount of this drawing out in each case is found to vary
in an important way with circumstances, and is probably but a measure of the
length of time the E.M.F. remains above the value necessary for discharge, and

--thus ultimately depends upon the arrangements used the coil, &c.

     If a spark gap in parallel with the tube be provided, the drawing out is cut

short by the passage of a spark at the gap. How early this occurs depends on the

distance between the sparking points. In this way comparatively sharp-looking

images are obtainable without otherwise altering the arrangements.

     The time the radiation lasted, as measured from the photographs obtained in
this way, varied from, roughly, the gj^ to the xtjJoti '^^ ^ second. In the first
case the points were too far apart for a spark to pass ; in the latter the points were
as near as possible consistent with getting any photographic effect.

     Experiments can also be made b)' using a phosphorescent screen, but the
measurements are not capable of being made with the same certainty : however,
it is a more convenient way to demonstrate the existence of the early cut-ofi' in the
duration of the radiation caused by a parallel spark.

    When the brake of the primary is made by hand by means of the usual hammer

arrangements, the results sometimes are difficult to explain. Often three images
appear as if three sparks occurred, each image being drawn out. This might be
merely due to something oscillatory in the circuits, but for the fact that the character

of the drawing out is peculiar, the half shadow region shading the wrong way.
That is to say, instead of passing uniformly in shade from the longer exposed parts

to the parts always covered while the radiation lasted, there is a fiuctuation in
intensity, so that a tooth is bounded first by a dark line or band, while the region
longer exposed outside this is not so black.

G. 0>t the delations between Kathode Kays, Bontgen Hays, and Becquerel
              Rays. By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, F.R.S.

     The author described experiments, made with vacuum tubes of several shapes,
to test several points in the relations between the various kinds of rays. It was
found that when kathode rays were caused to fall on an oblique platinum piece in
the interior of the tube, true kathodic shadows could be obtained in the rays
reflected from the platinum surface, from metallic and other objects interposed
between this target and the walls of the tube. These shadows were deflected
by magnets, and were affected in size by electrifying the interposed objects. At
the same time, and when the tube was sufficiently highly exhausted, Rontgen-ray
shadows were obtained on a luminescent screen outside ; but these shadows, unlike
ihe shadows of the reflected kathodic rays within the tube, were not deflected by
either magnetic or electrostatic influences. Experiments on filtering the kathodic
rays, direct and reflected, through screens of aluminium of various thicknesses
showed that the more deflectable rays were more easily stopped by screens than tha
less deflectable ; and that the power of producing luminescence in different bodies
differed for rays of different deflectability. Uranium, as a target, appeared to be
more active than platinum in evoking emission of Rontgen rays.

              By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, D.Sc, F.R.S. .

     This phenomenon, discovered by the author independently at the same time
with M. Henri Becquerel, consists in the persistent emission by certain substances,
notably by metallic uranium and its salts, of invisible rays which closely resemble
Rontgen rays in their photographic action, and in their power of penetrating
aluminium, and of producing diselectrification.

     The author finds the order of transparency of substances to be different for

these rays from that which exists for Rontgen's rays. He has also observed

photographic action through opaqiie screens of paper by light emitted from phos-
phorus slowly oxidising in air. The hyperphosphorescence of uranium in the
metallic state is about equal in darkness and when exposed to light, but with
uranium nitrate the continued stimulation of light promotes the emission of these

rays. No similar rays exist either in arc light or in sunlight as observed in

 London.

     The teiBperature coefficient is only one ten-tliousandth of a volt for 1° Centi-

grade.

     The cell has many other advantages. Its resistance remains constant, and is

lower than in most other cells used as standards. Notwithstanding this, the cell
 protects itself against a charging current from other sources, as well as from dis-
turhing tendency due to short circuit.

     The reason for this immunity from permanent disturbance is not yet clear, and
the authors are engaged in investigating it.

                   By the Rev. Robert Harley, M.A., F.R.S.

    The linear differential equations whose forms are recorded in this paper stand
in a very close and important relation to the trinomial forms of algebraic equations.

For, on the one hand, the complete integration of the differential equations deter-
mines the form of the roots of the algebraic equations, and, on the other, the general
solution of the algebraic equations determines the complete integrals of the several
differential equations ; so that the relation is reciprocal. In fact, the algebraic
equations and their corresponding differential equations are co-resolvents.

     In a paper printed in the British Association Report for 1878, at pp. 466-8, it
is shown that if y be a function of .r, and a, b, c arbitraries independent of .?· and w,

           5. On the Plotting out of Great Circle Routes on a Chart.
      By H. M. Taylor, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

     It is proposed that on the charts used by ocean-going vessels a series of curves
should be engraved, each curve representing accurately a great Circle.

    It is shown how such a series of curves may, without the use of mathematical
calculations, be made use of to plot out on the chart, with much accuracy, the
Great Circle route between any two points.

6. On the Stationary Motion of a System of Equal Elastic Spheres in a
     Field of no Forces when their Aggregate Volume is not Infinitely Small

The object of this paper is to prove that the velocities of spheres near to one

another are correlated.
     1. Consider first the system in which the molecules are material points, between

which there are no collisions, with their velocities distributed according to Max-
well's law. The chance that any n molecules shall have component velocities

P, and at any instant, be the component velocities of the centre of inertia of all

the molecules which at that instant are contained within a sphere of radius E.

We4. now pass to the case in which our molecules, instead of being material

7. On some Difficulties connected luith the Kinetic Theory of Gases.
                           By G. H. Bryan, Sc.D.

     The recent attacks of M. Bertrand on Maxwell's investigations emphasise the
view that all proofs of the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution involve some as-
sumption or other, and that such assumptions are only justifiable in attenuated
assemblages of molecules such as constitute an ideal gas. But if the thermal

properties of gases are really due to molecular motions, as the kinetic theory sup-

poses, the same must be true of the corresponding properties of matter in its other
states ; so that a kinetic theory of solids and liquids also must exist even though the

complete investigation of that theory may present insuperable difficulties to the
mathematician. Now, the most important physical property for which the kinetic

theory has to account is that of temperature, and the existence of such a quantity

Adepends on the fact that if a body be in thermal equilibrium with B, and also

Bwith C, then will be in thermal equilibrium with C : in other words, the condi-

Ation of thermal equilibrium between and B must be expressible in the form

                     /i(A)=/,(B)                                            (!>

where the left-hand side involves no variables depending on the state of B, and

the right-hand side involves no variables depending on the state of A.

On the assumption that the temperature of a body is proportional to the mean

kinetic energy of translation of its molecules, the condition of equal temperature

Arequires that if the mean translational energies of two sets of molecules  and

AB are equal, no energy will be transferred from  to B. Now if we take
Monly two molecules
                     and m, moving in the same straight line, the con-

dition for no transference of energy between them is not that their kinetic

energies shall he equal. Indeed, Prof. Tait has shown that this condition holds

Agood if the molecules of and B are distributed according to the Boltzmann-

Maxwell distribution, but not in general.

The author is at present investigating what restrictions are imposed on the law

of distribution of molecular velocity in order that the condition of thermal equi-

librium may be expressible in the form (1), in other words, in order that tempera-
ture may exist. The analysis is somewhat complicated, but it may be safely

concluded, even at the present stage, that the existence of temperature cannot be

inferred from dynamical considerations alone, independently of the law of dis-

tribution. It will be necessary for us to regard the laws of thermodynamics as

the fundamental assumptions of a general kinetic theory of matter rather than as

the results to he proved, and we must therefore deduce from those laws the nature

of the molecular motion which we call heat.

atoms of the whole assemblage. The next simplest case is that in which there are
two kinds of atom, h, o, with the distinction that the force between two )is and
the force between two os and the force between an h and an o are generally
different at the same distance. The mutual force between two Ks is, of course,
always the same at the same distance. So also is the mutual force between two
OS and between an h and an o.

     The object of the present communication is to find how much of the known
properties of the substances named in the title can be explained with no further

assumption except the conferring of inertia upon a Boscovich atom.

     The known chemical and physical properties to be provided for are

     1. Tliat in each of the gases named the molecule is divisible into two ; which
is the meaning of the symbols IT,,, (.).,, used to denote them in chemistry.

      2. That Ozone (O3) is a possible, though not a very stable, gaseous molecule,
consisting of a group of Oxygen atoms of which the constituents readily pass into
the configuration (0,,^ of Oxygen gas.

     3. That Peroxide of Hydrogen (II/X, or perhaps HO) is a possible, but not a
very stable, combination, which, for all we know, may exist as a liquid or a dry gas,
 but which is only generally known as a solution in water (of density 1"45 in the

highest concentration hitherto reached), readily absorbing Hydrogen or parting
with (~)xygen so as to form 11.^0.

     4. That water (H.,0) is an exceedingly stable compound in the gaseous, liquid,
or crystalline form, according to circumstances of temperature and pressure.

      5. That dry mixtures of Hydrogen and Oxygen gases, and also mixtures of
these gases with water in the same inclosure, have been kept by many experi-
menters for weeks or months, and perhaps for years, inclosed in glass vessels,
without any combination of the two gases having been detected.

      6. That Ice contracts by about 8 per cent, in melting, and that ice-cold water,

when warmed, contracts till it reaches a maximum density at about 4° C, and

expands on further elevation of temperature.

      (b) The similarity between each face and its neighbour on either side turned

      (c) The right-handed and left-handed chiralities of different crystals in nature
 with, so far as known, an equal chance of one chirality or the other in any crystal

      In the present communication it is shown that all the properties stated in this

Hschedule can be conceivably explained by making consist of two Boscovich atoms

 (Ji, A), and of two others (0, o). This essentially makes 11., consist of four A's at
 the corners of an equilateral tetrahedron, and Oo a similar configuration of four o's.
 It naturally shows Ozone as six o's at the corners of a regular octahedron. It makes

HjO (the gaseous molecule of water) consist of two o's with two Ks. attached to

one of them and two other A's attached to the other ; the Jia of each getting as
 near to the other o as the mutual repulsion of the A's allows. This configuration
 and the modification it experiences in the formation of crystals of ice are illus-
 trated by models which accompany the communication.

     To imderstand Avhat is probably the true configuration of ice-ciystal, we are

 helped by first considering a double cubic assemblage of point-atoms, such that
 each point-atom is in the centre of a cube having eight point-atoms for its corners.

This double cul)ic assemblage may be imagined as consisting of two simple cubic

 assemblages, so placed that one atom of each assemblage is in the centre of a
 cube of atoms of the other. The annexed diagram shows, in the centres of the
 circles which it contains, atoms of a double cubic assemblage, which lie in the
 plane of a pair of remote parallel edges, a d, b c, of one set of constituent cubes.
 It shows all the atoms in the lines of this plane which it contains except certain
 omissions in the lines ad, d c, made specially on account of the present applica-
 tion of the diagram. The circles of simple shading and of shading interrupted
 by two small concentric circles constitute one of the simple cubic assemblages

      to A C in the same definite ratio of perhaps about 3 to 1. It then represents what

      circles with simple shading and with shading interrupted by two concentric

I circles denoting hydrogen atoms, and the circles with shading interrupted by
      single concentric circles the oxygen atoms.
          The named properties of Quartz are explained by supposing the crystalline
      molecule to consist of three of the chemical molecules (OSiO) to be placed together
      in a manner readily imagined according to a suggestion which I communicated to
           ' The assemblage thus constituted is precisely that described in Section 24, and

3. A Magnetic Detector of Electrical Waves.
           By E. Rutherford, M.A.

It has long been known that a steel needle placed in a spiral round which an

ordinary Leyden jar discharge is passed is magnetised. The magnetism of the
needle is generally confined to the surface, and the way in which the magnetisation

varies from the surface inwards may be directly determined by dissolving the

needle slowly in acid before a magnetometer.

     If a magnetised piece of steel wire be subjected to the discharge, the magnetic

moment is always reduced, whatever the direction of the discharge. The screening

action of thin cylinders of metal for the discharge may be immediately shown by

placing tnem between the solenoid and detector needle. With a thin copper

cylinder the needle remained unaS'ected, while a few turns of tinfoil gave a small

effect.

   A short steel wire magnetised to saturation also has the remarkable property of

being able to distinguish between the two first half oscillations of the discharge. If

the needle is saturated, in one direction the first half oscillation can produce no efiiect

on the magnetism of the needle, since it is already saturated, while in the opposite

direction it produces its full effect. From the comparisons of the fall of magnetic
moment of the needle in the two cases, the damping of the discharge may be
deduced. By an application of this method also the apparent resistance of air

breaks of different lengths to the discharge was deduced, and the resistance of iron

wires for currents of high frequency of alternation obtained. Instead of a single

wire a compound needle of short thin steel wires insulated from each other by
paraffin was used. This was a sensitive means of detecting and comparing oscil-

lation of small intensity. If a circle of wire 30 cm. in diameter be taken, and the

discharge passed round only a small portion of its arc, there is quite a large effect
on the detector needle at the centre.

     If a discharge is sent longitudivally through a short magnetised steel wire, the

magnetic moment is always reduced, due to the circular magnetisation of the

surface layers of the wire. Using a thin wire in series with the circuit, oscillations

of very small frequency may thus be detected.

   A compound detector needle of fine wire placed in a solenoid of two or three

turns is a very simple and convenient means of investigating waves along wires
and determining nodes and antinodes.

   A compound detector needle was also found to be a sensitive means of detecting

Hertzian waves in free space at large distances from the vibrator.

   A collection of twenty or thirty fine steel wires, each about 1 cm. long,

was taken and formed into a compound detector needle, each wire being insulated

Afrom the other to prevent eddy currents.     fine wire solenoid of several hundred

turns was wound over it. When the small solenoid was placed in series with

receiving wires, a wave falling on the receiver set up oscillations in that circuit,
and the needle is more or less demagnetised according to the intensity of the wave.
Using large vibrators effects were obtained at a distance of over half a mile between

the vibrator and receiver.

mounted on stands sliding in an optical bench. Experiments are carried out with

divergent or parallel beam of electric radiation. To obtain a parallel beam, a

cylindrical lens of sulphur or ebonite is mounted in a square tube. This lens tube

fits on the radiator tube, and is stopped by a guide when the oscillatory spark is

at the principal focal line of the lens. The radiator tube is further provided with

a series of diaphragms by which the amount of radiation may be varied.

For experiments requiring angular measurement, a spectrometer circle is

mounted on one of the sliding stands. The spectrometer carries a circular platform

on which the various reflectors, refractors, &c., are placed. The platform carries

an index, and can rotate independently of the circle on which it is mounted. The

receiver is carried on a radial arm (provided with an mdex) and points to the

centre of the circle. An observing telescope may also be used with an objective

made of ebonite with a linear receiver at the focal plane. But an ordinary receiver

provided with a funnel is all that is necessary for ordinary experiments.

9. The E^§ect of Atmospheric Refraction on the Apparent Diurnal Move-

     ment of Stars, and a Method of allorviny for it in Astronomical

    Photography. By Professor A. A. Rambaut, M.A., Sc.D.

The variation in tbe degree of refraction which the light of a star undergoes in

passing through the earth's atmosphere, apart from irregularities which arise from
local disturbances in the strata of air, affects the apparent movement of a star, so

that the angular motion depends upon its position in the sky.

    When approaching its upper culmination the hour angle of a star is diminished

by refraction, but to a continually diminishing extent, and consequently tbe motion

of a star at this part of its course appears slower than it actually is. After
culmination the i-esult is similar, the refraction in this case throwing the apparent,

more and more to the following side of the true, image as the distance from the

meridian increases.

    When the observer's object is merely to obtain pictures of star groups the work

can be so arranged that each group is photographed when it arrives at or near the
meridian. It is different, however, when it is intended to utilise the plates for the

detection of stellar parallax. In connection with this research, it is desirable that

a large proportion of the photographs should be taken when the stars are near the
apses of their parallactic ellipses, and this condition often necessitates the photo-

graphing of stars at very large hour angles.

    If the apparent western hour angle of a star at any moment be denoted by //,
the effect of refraction in hour angle by AA, the right ascension by a, and the

sidereal time by 6 ; then

                                   h=6-a + ^.h

                           and d-nei = l + -div6, ·

Hence the expression ^ ^ measures the rate at which the apparent movement

                                 da

gains on sidereal time.

    If (^ denotes the latitude and S the declination, and if we assume m, n, fi, v,

such that

           mtan = cot (p cos h^      cot ^ = tan ^ cos //,
                                     =cot v cos jj, tan //,
           cot n = sin rti tan h,

then we may write

                   ^dh _ -I _/3 cos  sin v sin +(/^ 8)       7C

                   d6 cos S sin- n sin'- {m + d)

in which /3 is the refraction constant.
     If the telescope were required to follow the star with absolute precision it

would be necessary to construct a clockwork system which would drive the
instrument at a rate varying continually with the hour angle according to the law
expressed by this formula. In practice, however, it is sufficient to alter the rate at
intervals, the length of which will depend upon the rapidity of the refraction

changes, provided always that the error thus introduced does not exceed a certain

definite limit.

   A description of the method of making this alteration, a full account of how

formula (a) is deduced, and diagrams showing the appropriate rate for any given
hour angle and declination, and the length of exposure for which a uniform rate
is permissible, will be found in the ' Monthly Notices ' of the Royal Astronomical

Society.

   10. On the Sailing Flight of Birds. By G. H. Bryan, Se.D., F.R.S.

     That birds are capable, imder certain circumstances, of supporting themselves
indefinitely in the air without expending energy by flapping their wings is a matter

of common observation. To account for this apparent realisation of 'perpetual
                                                   ----

                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.               727

motion ' various theories have been proposed, and amongst these the most important
are the three which suppose the seat of available energy to lie in

     (1) Upward air-currents (Mr. Maxim).

     (2) Variations of the wind-velocity at different heights above the ground (Lord

"Rayleigh).

     (i^) Variations of the wind-velocity from one instant to another, the wind
habitually blowing in gusts separated by lulls (Dr. S. P. Langley and others).

    Before proceeding further, another source of energy may be mentioned, namely,

the presence of vortices, i.e., miniature whirlwinds or cyclones, in the atmosphere.

Even on a perfectly calm day one of these little vortices may sometimes be seen

travelling across a road, carrying up a funnel-shaped cloud of dust. Accordinf to
mathematical theory, a vortex always consists of the same particles of fluid ; and,
even under the modified conditions which occur in nature, our experience of
cyclones tells us that such vortices are remarkable for their persistency, and their
motions are so regular that it would be easy for birds to take advantage of them.
This would account for the fact that birds so often congregate in a certain spot

when in sailing flight.

     Against the third hypothesis it has been objected

    (i.) That to take advantage of every puff of wind in such a way as to be lifted

up by it would be an extremely difficult feat of aerial gymnastics, whereas birds
appear to circle in the air without requiring to exercise any particular alertness or

agility.

     (ii.) That the variations in wind-velocity are not sufficient to sustain the weight
of a bird in the air.

In answer to the first objection, it is to be observed that if the bird's centre of
--mass is slightly helow the wing-surface especiall)' if the wings are slightly curved
-- Weupwards the action will be purely automatic.
                                                   may illustrate this point perhaps

better by considering the parallel effect in the seeds of many composite plants

(such as the common ' dandelion '), which are supported in the air by a parachute

placed at some distance above them. If a sudden gust of wind blows upon such a

seed, the parachute is set in motion more rapidly than the seed, causing the structure

to heel over so as to receive the wind on the under surface of the parachute, and

Whenthis lifts the seed.  the wind subsides, the greater inertia of the seed carries

it on in front of the parachute, causing the latter to again present its under side to
the air, which again lifts the seed. The more the seed is blown about, the more it

rises in the air.

    This action would take place automatically in the same way in any body whose
supporting parachute, aeroplane, or wing surface was slightly above' its, centre of

mass. Tlie height of the supporting surface should not be too great, otherwise

the body would heel over too much, and would make so great an angle with the
horizon that the lift would be considerably reduced.

The effect evidently depends on the inertia of the body, and the lift could

therefore be increased by increasing the body's ma.ss. But this ^^ould also increase
the weif/Iit of the body in the same proportion, so that no advantage would be

[gained.

      The difficulty is overcome in the case of the sailing bird by the increased

[buoyancy which it is able to obtain from the air in consequence of the horizontal

jspeed at which it travels, and herein, to my mind, lies the answer to the second

joDJection. Dr. S. P. Langley ^ has found (1) that a horizontal plane under the

 with horizontal velocity than it would do if allowed to fall vertically, and (2) that
 the horse-power required to support a body iu horizontal flight by means of an

    According to tliis theorj', the sailing Hrd derives its energy from fluctuations

in the resolved part of the wind-velocity, at right angles to the bird's course.

Such side -winds would, in particular, be brought into action first on one side and
then on the other whenever the bird passed through the centre of an atmospheric
vortex. The exact part played by variations of wind-velocity in the direction of
the bird's course is more difficult to understand, but it seems improbable that such
variations alone could account for the phenomena. If the bird were moving
slowly enough to receive tlie wind sometimes in front and sometimes from behind,
it would at intermediate instants be at rest relative to the wind, and would then
obtain the minimum degree of support. If it were moving rapidly through the
air, the latter would always strike the bird in front, so that its horizontal motion

would be constantly retarded.
     Anyone watching a flock of birds will observe that they often actually are

carried up by a sudden side-gust of wind in the manner here described, showing
that if this is not the only cause of the phenomena presented by the sailing bird,
it is at any rate one of the causes. So much has been written on the subject that

it is impossible to say how far these remarks may have been anticipated by other
writers ; but I think they may help to clear up some of the difficulties which have

been experienced in accounting for the sailing flight of birds.

                                    By A. Laurence Rotch.

     This is a preliminary account of experiments being conducted at the Blue Hill
Meteorological Observatory, lioadville, Massachusetts. The author, after referring
to previous instances of the use of kites for meteorological purposes, gives details of
the apparatus and methods employed at Blue Hill in kite observations, which were
commenced in 1891, and are still being carried on. The kites are, some of
trapezoidal, and some of Hargreaves' cellular, form, and are controlled by pianoforte
wire of 300 lb. tensile strength. The pull on the wire is not allowed to exceed

125 lb. Two self-recording aluminium instruments are used, one recording, on a

single cylinder, barometric pressure, temperature, and humidity. The other records
temperature, humidity, and wind-velocity.

     Each is suspended between two kites to diminish oscillation.

    As an illustration of the importance of the use of kites in weather prediction
may be mentioned the fact, which has been demonstrated at Blue Hill, that in the
United States, at least, warm and cold waves commence in the upper regions before

they are felt at the ground. The conditions at mountain stations only approximate

to those prevailing in the free air. Kites are superior to captive balloons, as being
both cheaper and capable of flying through a greater range of wind velocity, and to

greater altitudes.

     This work praitically consists of the life-history of the instruments. It is
therein shown, as the result of observations carried on for four years, that the zero
point of a mercurial thermometer (when fully corrected for the above constants)
is a complicated function of time and temperature environment. It will be proved

experimentally that the so-called ' depression of the freezing point ' is not a constant,
but that the magnitude of the depression is a function depending upon the previous
environment and the duration of the cause of the depression.

1. Mmsiirement by means of the Spectroscope of the Telocity of Rotation of

    the Plnriets. By James E. Keeler, Sc.D.] Allegheny Observatory.

     The method of determining the velocity of rotation of a planet by means of the
spectroscope was suggested at a comparatively early date, but lit is only quite

recently that accurate measures have been made. Such measures, in which the
spectrum is photographed, instead of being observed directly, have been made by
Deslandres, JSelopolsky, Campbell, and by the author. The slit of the spectroscope
is always made to coincide as nearly as possible with the equator of the image of
the planet, so that the inclination of the planetary lines on the photographed spec-

trum may be as great as possible, and measurement of this angle gives, when the

linear dispersion and size of the image of the planet are known, the equatorial

velocity of rotation.

     In the Astrop/zi/sical Journal for May, 1895, the author gives a convenient
formula lor reducing the observations when the planet is in opposition. It is

       Y_pDLtan(^
             ^Xcos^'

If the planet is not nearly in opposition, so that the earth and sun as seen from it

are separated by the angular distance a, we must write 1 + cos o in the denominator
instead of i>. (Deslandres, C.R. 120, 417 ; Poincare, C.R. 120, 420.) The formula

then becomes

from the limb really come from a considerable depth, where the velocity of
rotation is less. The observations above given do not support this view, since the
velocity deduced from them is a little too great, It is altogether probable that
the discrepancies noted by Belopolsky are due to errors of observation. If, how-
ever, the slit were not properly placed, a velocity slightly too small would be
obtained, since the angular velocity of the surface diminishes with increasing

latitude, and falls off quite rapidly in the region near the equator.
     In 1895 the author succeeded in showing, by an extension of the same method,

that the velocity at any point on the ring of Saturn is that of a particle moving
in obedience to Kepler's third law, and hence that the ring is not a solid body.
Attempts to determine the rotation of Venus have so far been unsuccessful.

      2. On the Photo-electric Sensitlsation of Salts hy Cathodic Rays.
  Py Professor J. Elster and Professor Geitel, Wolfenbilttel, Genanny.

    The results of the investigation made by the authors may be summed up as

follows :

     Cathodic rays falling upon the chlorides of caesium, rubidium, potassium, sodium,
lithium, clear fluorspar, and even powdered glass, convert these salts into

substances which are incapable of retaining a negative charge of electricity when

exposed to light belonging to the visible part of the spectrum.
     All circumstances capable of abolishing the colours produced by cathodic

radiation also destroy the photo-electric sensitiveness.

   A complete account of the investigation will shortly be published in Y/ jede-

mann's ' Anualen.'

               4. Some Experivients on Absorption and Fluorescence.

                                 By John Burke, B.A.

     Fluorescent bodies are generally more or less transparent to the rays they emit.
The experiments were with a view to detecting whether any difference exists
between the absorption when a body is fluorescing and when not. The comparisons
were made with a form of double slit photometer in which photography was
employed, described at length in the paper. Allowing for the various sources of

error which may possibly arise, there still i-emains a marked difference between the

intensity of the light transmitted in the two cases, amounting in some instances
to a ditterence of 40 per cent, in the absorptive power. Thus a substance such as
uranium glass would appear to be less transparent to the yellow rays from a candle
in daylight than in the dark. The latter part of the paper deals with the influence
of dissociation on fluorescence and with the theory of fluorescence iiself.

5, On Homogeneous Structures and the Symmetrical Partitioning of them-,
    v:ith application to Crystals.^ By William Barlow.

     This paper is the outcome of several years' study of the geometrical possibilities
of symmetrical space relations, the importance of which in regard to crystals has
long been recognised, and whose value in relation to the fundamental concepts of
matter generally is of late becoming more and more appreciated. The inquiry is
a purely geometrical one, and is therefore independent of any particular concept as
to the ultimate nature of matter.

     The basis of the investigation is a definition of homogeneity of structure which

runs as follows :

whose situations in the structure are precisely similar, so that all of the infinite

number of g'eonietrical point-systems respectively obtained by taking all similarly
situated ])oints are regular infinite point-systems defined by Sohncke as systems of
points such that the arrangement about any one of these points of the rest of the
points of the system is the same as it is about any other of them.'

      This definition is not limited in its application to point-systems or assemblages

cf particles ; it may be obeyed by any kind of structure, whetlier material or merely

geometrical, whether filling space or continuously ramifying through it, or distributed
through it in discrete patches. It may, too, be obeyed by structures whose parts are
in motion, provided the similai'ity extends to the movements of similar parts ; but
the similar movements need not be simultaneous ; they may, for example, resemble
the rhythmically related movements of combinedJigure skntin;/.

     The models employed to show the nature of the repetition in space which cha-
racterises different types of homogeneous structure consist of symmetrically arranged
dolls' hands, the reason for employing these objects being that they are familiar and
and at the same time of so exceptional a shape as to avoid any suggestion that a
particular form is essential for the ultimate parts of a structure.

      Primarily the structures are to be regarded as not partitioned into parts, the

tvpe of homogeneity being expressed in a more general manner when there is no

partitioning.

     The number of different types of symmetrical arrangement presented by all
unpartitioned homogeneous structures is 230.

     As to the symmetrical partitioning of homogeneous structures the author points
out that many different types of partitioning into molecular units are possible for
each typei of structure, and appends a fragment of a table of the types of partitioning

which pertain to the different types of structure belonging to the cubic system.

G. The Division of an Alternating Current in Parallel Circuits ivith

                   Mutual Induction. By Frederick Bedell.

   A divided circuit with mutual induction between the two branches is the same

as a transformer with the primarj' and secondary circuits connected in parallel.

The problem may be treated in the same manner as that of the transformer. The

electromotive force equations for the two circuits are similar, the internal electro-
motive forces in each being equal to the same impressed electromotive force. The

electromotive force of mutual induction will be positive or negative according to
the sense or direction in which the coils are connected. If the coils are connected
so that the ampere turns of the two coils assist each other, the electromotive force
of self and mutual induction will be of the same sign, and the coefficient of mutual
induction will be positive. If the coils are connected so that the two oppose each
other, the electromotive force of mutual induction will be opposed in sign to that

Mof self-induction. The coefficient of mutual induction may accordingly be plus

or minus M. Writing the electromotive force as a function of the time, the
electromotive force equations for the two circuits are

MDue =f(t) = Rji'i + LiD/i +     ;

e =f{t) = R,,«., + LjD/j ± MDij

R Lwhere e and i represent current and electromotive force, and represent resist-

Dance and self-induction, and stands for the operator -- . The solution of these

                                                                                                      at

equations gives us the values for the currents in the two circuits, and their phase

relations. Where the coils are opposed and nearly similar, the angle of phase
difference between the currents depends largely upon the amount of magnetic

leakage.

     The graphical treatment of the problem shows this relation more clearly. The
electromotive force to overcome the resistance of each circuit is represented by a
vector in the direction of the current. The electromotive forces of self and mutual

induction are at right angles to the currents in their respective circuits. This

gives us three vectors for the electromotive forces in either circuit, and the sum of

these three vectors in either circuit is equal to the electromotive force impressed

upon the two circuits. The direction of the vector representing the electromotive
force of mutual induction depends upon the sense in which the coils are

connected.

     The equivalent resistance and self-induction of the two coils together, whether
they are additive or opposed, may be found by resolving the electromotive force
into two components, one in the direction of the main current, and the other at
right angles to it. The resultant of these components may be obtained graphically
and from them the values of the equivalent resistance R^, and the equivalent self-
induction L'. The equivalent resistance and self-induction of their branches may
be obtained in the same manner.

     Particular cases may be discussed by assuming definite values for the constants

 of the circuits or definite relations between them.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.

     Tlie President delivered the following Address :

In endeavouring' to fix upon a suitable theme for the address I knew you
would to-day expect from me, I have felt that I ought to give due considei'ation
to the interests which tie this magnificent city of Liverpool, whose hospitality we

Benjoy this week, to Section of the British Association.

     I have therefore chosen to give you a brief history of the manufacture of
chlorine, with the progress of which this city and its neighbourhood have been
very conspicuously and very honourably connected, not only as regards quantity
I believe this neighbourhood produces to-day nearly as much chlorine as the rest

--of this world together but more particularly by having originated, worked out,

and carried into practice several of the most important improvements ever intro-

duced into this manufacture. I was confirmed in my choice by the fact that this

manufacture has been influenced and perfected in an extraordinary degree by the
rapid assimilation and application of the results of purely scientific investigations

and of new scientific theories, and oilers a very remarkable example of the

incalculable value to our commercial interests of the progress of pure science.
     The early history of chlorine is particularly interesting, as it played a most

important ry/c in the development of chemical theories. There can be no doubt

that the Arabian alchemist Geber, who lived eleven hundred years ago, must have
known that ' Aqua PiCgia,' which he prepared by distilling a mixture of salt,

nitre, and vitriol, gave ofl" on heating very corrosive, evil-smelling, greenish-
yellow fumes, and all his followers throughout a thousand years must have been

more or less molested by these fumes whenever they used Aqua Regia, the one

solvent of the gold they attempted so persistently to produce.
     But it was not until 1774 that the great Swedish chemist Scheele succeeded

in establishing the character of these fumes. He discovered that on heating

manganese with muriatic acid he obtained fumes very similar to those given off
by ' Aqua Eegia,' and found that these fumes constituted a permanent gas of
yellowish-green colour, very pungent odour, very corrosive, very irritating to the
respiratory organs, and which had the power of destroying organic colouring

matters.

      According to the views prevalent at the time, Scheele considered that the
manganese had removed phlogiston from the muriatic acid, and he consequently
called the gas dephlogisticated muriatic acid.

    When during the next decade Lavoisier successfully attacked, and after a

memorable struggle completely upset, the phlogiston theory and laid the founda-
tions of our modern chemistry, Berthollet, the eminent 'father' of physical
                                    --

                        TRANSACTIOINS OF SECTION B.                   735

-- --chemistry the science of to-day endeavoured to determine the place of Scheele's

gas in the new theorJ^ Lavoisier was of opinion that all acids, including muriatic

acid, contain oxygen. BerthoUet found that a solution of Scheele's gas in

water, when exposed to the sunlight, gives off oxygen and leaves behind muriatic

acid. He considered this as proof that this gas consists of muriatic acid and

oxygen, and called it oxygenated muriatic acid.

     In the year 1785 BerthoUet conceived the idea of utilising the colour-

destroying powers of this gas for bleaching purposes. He prepared the gas by
heating a mixture of salt, manganese, and vitriol. He used a solution of the gas

in water for bleaching, and subsequently discovered that the product obtained by

absorbing the gas in a solution of cau?tic potash possessed great advantages in

practice.

This solution was prepared as early as 1789, at the chemical works on the

Quai de Javelle, in Paris, and is still made and used there under the name of
' Eau de Javelle.'

     James Watt, whose great mind was not entirely taken up with that greatest

-- --of all inventions his steam-engine by wliich he has benefited the human race
--more than any other man, but who also did excellent work in chemistry became

acquainted in Paris with BerthoUet's process, and brought it to Scotland. Here

it was taken up with that energy characteristic of the Scotch, and a great stride

forward was made when, in 1798, Charles Tennant, the founder of the great firm,

which has only recently lapsed into the United Alkali Compajiy, began to use

milk of lime, in place of the more costly caustic potash, in making a bleaching

liquid ; and a still greater advance was made when, in the following year,

Tennant proposed to absorb the chlorine by hydrate of lime, and thus to produce

a dry substance, since known under the name of bleaching powder, which allowed

the bleaching powers of chlorine to be transported to any distance.

In order to give you a conception of the theoretical ideas prevalent at this

time, I will read to you a passage from an interesting treatise on the art of

bleaching published in 1799 by Higgins. In his chapter ' On bleaching with the

oxygenated muriatic acid, and on the methods of preparing it ' he explains the

theory of the process as follows :

' Slanganese is an oxyd, a metal saturated with oxygen gas. Common salt is

composed of muriatic acid and an alkaline salt called soda, the same which barilla

affords. Manganese has greater affinity to sulphuric acid than to its oxygen, and

the soda of the salt greater afhnity to sulphuric acid than to the muriatic acid

gas                     hence it necessarily follows  that these two  gases (or rather their gravitating
                     ;

matter) must be liberated from their former union in immediate contact with each

other ; and although thev have but a weak affinity to one another, they unite in

their nascent state, that is to say, before they individually unite to caloric, and

-separately assume the gaseous state; for ox)'geu gas and muriatic acid gas already

formed will not unite when mixed, in consequence principally of the distance at

which their respective atmospheres of caloric keep their gravitating particles

asunder. The compound resulting from these two gases still retains the property

of assuming the gaseous state, and is the oxygenated muriatic gas.'

Interesting as these views may appear, considering the time they were pub-

mlished, you will notice that the role played by the manganese        the process and

the chemical nature of this substance were not at all understood. The law of

multiple proportions had not yet been propounded by John Ualton, and the

researches of Berzelius on the oxides of manganese were only published thirteen

years later, in 1812. The green gas we are considering was still looked upon as

muriatic acid, to which oxygen had been added, in contradistinction to Scheele's

view, who considered it as muriatic acid, from which, something, viz., phlogiston,

had been abstracted.

It was Humphry Davy who had, by a series of brilliant investigations carried

·out in the Laboratory of the Royal Institution between 1808 and 1810, accumu-

lated fact upon fact to prove that the gas hitherto called oxygenated muriatic acid

did not contain oxygen. He announced in an historic paper, which he read before

the Royal Society on July 1:?, 1810, liis conclusion that this gas was an elementary

body, whicli iu muriatic acid was combined with hydrogen, and for which he
proposed the name ' chlorine/ derived from the Greek ;^XQ)pds, signifying ' green,'

the colour by which the gas is distinguished.

The numerous communications which Humphry Davy made to the Royal

Society on this subject form one of the brightest and most interesting chapters iu

the history of chemistry. They have recently been reprinted by the Alembic

Society, and I cannot too highly recommend their study to the young students of

our science.

I need not remind those who have followed the history of chemistry how hotly

and persistently Davy's views were combated by a number of the most eminent

chemists of his time, led by Berzelius himself; how long the chlorine controversy

divided the chemical world ; how triumphantly Davy emerged from it ; how com-

pletely his views were  recognised                                                    and  how very instrumental  they have been in

    The hope, however, which Davy expressed in that same historic paper, ' that
these new views would perhaps facilitate one of the greatest problems in economi-

cal chemistry, the decomposition of the muriates of soda and potash,' was not to

be realised so soon. Although it had changed its name, chlorine was still for

many years manufactured by heating a mixture of salt, manganese, and sulphuric

acid iu leaden stills, as before.

This process leaves a residue consisting of sulphate of soda and sulphate of

manganese, and for some time attempts were made to recover the sulphate of soda

from these residues, and to use it for the manufacture of carbonate of soda by the

Le Blanc process. On the other hand, the Le Blanc process, which had been dis-

covered and put into jiractice almost simultaneously with Berthollet's chlorine

process, decomposed salt by sulphuric acid, and sent the muriatic acid evolved

into the atmosphere, causing a great nuis^ance to tlie neighbourhood.

Naturally, therefore, when Mr. William Gossage had succeeded in devising

plant for condensing this muriatic acid, the manufacturers of chlorine reverted to

the original process of Scheele, and heated manganese with the muriatic acid thus

obtained. Since then the manufacture of chlorine had become a by-product of

the manufacture of soda by the Le Blanc process, and remained so till very

recently.

For a great many years the muriatic acid was allowed to fict upon native ores

of manganese in closed vessels of earthenware or stone, to which heat could be

applied, either externally or internally. These native manganese ores, containing

only a certain amount of peroxide, converted only a certain percentage of the

muriatic acid employed into free chlorine, the rest combining with the manganese

and iron contained in the ore, and forming a brown and very acid solution, which

it was a great difiiculty for the manufacturer to get rid of. Consequently, many

attempts were made to regenerate peroxide of manganese from these waste liquors,

so as to use it over again in the production of chlorine.

These, however, for a long time remained unsuccessful, because the exact

conditions for super-oxidising the protoxide of manganese by means of atmospheric

air were not yet known.

Meantime, viz., in 1845, Mr. Dunlop introduced into the works created by his-

grandfather, Mr. Charles Tennant, at St. Ilollox, a new and very interesting

method for producing chlorine, which was in a certain measure a return to the

process used by the alchemists.

     Indeed, the first part of this process consisted in decomposing a mixture of

--salt and nitre with oil of vitriol a reaction that had been made use of for so many

centuries ! The chlorine so obtained is, however, not pure, but a mixture of

chlorine Avith oxides of nitrogen and hydrochloric acid, which Mr. Dunlop had to

find means to eliuiinate.

For separating the nitrous oxides, Mr. Dunlop adopted the method introduced

twenty years before by the great Gay-Lussac in connection with vitriol-making,

viz., absorption by sulphuric acid, and the nitro-sulphuric acid thus formed he also

utilised in the same way as that obtained from the towers which still bear Gay-

Lussac's illustrious name, viz., by using it in the vitriol process in lieu of nitric
                                                                                  --

acid, lie then freed his chlorine gas from hydrochloric acid by washing with

water, and so obtained it pure. This process possessed two distinct advantages :

(1) it yielded a very much larger amount of chlorine from the same amount of
salt ; and (2) the nitric acid, which was used for oxidising the hydrogen in the
hydrochloric acid, was not lost, because the oxides of nitrogen to which it was

reduced answered the purpose for which the acid itself had previously been

employed. But this process was very limited in its application, as it could only

be worked to the extent to which nitric acid was used in vitriol-making.

    The process has been at work at St. RoUox for over fifty years, and, as far as I

know, is still in operation there ; but I am not aware that it has ever been taken

up elsewhere.

Within the last few years, however, several serious attempts have been made

to give to this process a wider scope by regenerating nitric acid from the nitro-

sulphuric acid and employing it over and over again to produce chloruie from hydro-

chloric acid. Quite a number of patents have been taken out for this purpose, all

employing atmospheric air for reconverting the nitrous oxides into nitric acid, and

differing mainly in details of apparatus and methods of work, and several of these

have been put to practical test on a fairly large scale in this neighbourhood, and

also in Glasgow, Middlesbrough, and elsewhere. As I do not want to keep you

here the whole afternoon, I have to draw the line somewhere as to what 1 shall

include in this brief history of the manufacture of chlorine, and have had to decide

to restrict myself to those methods which have actually attained the rank of

manufacturing processes on a large scale. As none of the processes just referred

to have attained that position, you will excuse me for not entering into further

details respecting them.

Mr. Duulop's process only produced a very small portion of the chlorine

manufactured at that time at St. llollox, the remainder being made, as before,

from native manganese and muriatic acid, leaving behind the very offensive waste

liquors I have mentioned before, which increased from year to year, and became

more and more difficult to get rid of. The problem of recovering from these liquors

the manganese in the form of peroxide Mr. Dunlop succeeded in solving in 18.55.

    He neutralised the free acid and precipitated the iron present by treating these

liquors with ground chalk in the cold and settling out, and in later years filter-

pressing the precipitate, which left him a solution of chloride of manganese, mixed

only with chloride of calcium. This was treated with a fresh quantity of milk of

chalk, but this time under pressure in closed vessels provided with agitators and

heated by steam, vmder which conditions all the manganese was precipitated as

carbonate of manganese. This precipitate was filtered off and well drained, and

was then passed on iron trays mounted on carriages through long chambers, in

which it was exposed to hot air at a temperature of 300° C, the process being

practically made continuous, one tray at the one end being taken out of these

chambers, and a fresh tray being put in at the other end. One passage through

these chambers sufficed to convert the carbonate of manganese into peroxide,

which was used in place of, and in the same way as, the native manganese.

The whole of the residual liquors made at the large works at St. Rollox have

been treated by this process with signal success for a long number of years. For

a short time the process was discontinued in favour of the Weldon process (of

which I have to speak next) ; but after two years Dunlop 's process was taken up

myagain, and, to the best of  knowledge, it is still in operation to this day. It

has, however, just like Mr. Dunlop's first chlorine process, never left the place of its

birth (St. Rollox), although it was for a period of over ten years without a rival.

     In 1866 Mr. Walter Weldon patented a modification of a process proposed
by Mr, William Gossage in 1837 for recovering the manganese that had been

used in the manufacture of chlorine. Mr. Gossage had proposed to treat the

residual liquors of this manufacture by lime, and to oxidise the resulting protoxide

of manganese by bringing it into frequent and intimate contact with atmospheric

-- --air. This process and several modifications thereof subsequently patented had

been tried in various places without success. Mr. Weldon, hovpever, did succeed

-- --in obtaining a very satisfactory result, possibly even probably because, not
738 KEPOKT-- 1896.

beinpf a chemist, he did not add the equivalent quantity of lime to his liquor to

precipitate the manganese, hut used an excess. However, Mr. Weldon, if he was

not a chemist at that time, was a man of genius and of great perseverance. He

soon made himself a chemist, and having once got a satisfactory result, he studied

every small detail of the reaction with the utmost tenacity until he had thoroughly

established how this satisfactory result could be obtained on the largest scale with

the greatest regularity and certainty.

    He even went further, and added considerably to our theoretical knowledge of

the character of manganese peroxide and similar peroxides by putting forward the

view that these compounds possess the character of weak acids. He explained in
this way the necessity for the presence of an excess of lime or other base if the

oxidation of the precipitated protoxide of manganese by means of atmospheric air

was to proceed at a sufficiently rapid rate. He pointed out that the product had

to be considered as a manganite of calcium, a view which has since been

thoroughly proved by the investigations of Goergen and others ; and it is only fair
to state that Weldon's process is not only a process for recovering the peroxide of

manganese originally used, but that be introduced a new substance, viz., manga-

nite of calcium, to be continuously used over and over again in the manufacture of

chlorine.

Mr. Weldon had the good fortune that his ideas were taken up with fervency

by Colonel Gamble of St. Helens, and that Colonel Gamble's manager, Mr. F.

Bramwell, placed all his experience as a consummate technical chemist and

engineer at Mr. Weldon's disposal, and assisted him in carrying his ideas into

practice. The result was that a process which many able men had tried in vain

to realise for thirty years became in the hands of Mr. Weldon and his coadjutors

within a few years one of the greatest successes achieved in manufacturing

chemistry.

The Weldon process commences by treating the residual liquor with ground

chalk or limestone, thus neutralising the free acid and precipitating any sulphuric

acid and oxide of iron present. The clarified liquor is run into a tall cylindrical

vessel, and milk of lime is added in sufficient quantity to precipitate all the

manganese in the form of protoxide. An additional quantity of milk of lime, from

one-tifth to one-third of the quantity previously used, is then introduced, and air

passed through the vessel by means of an air-compressor. After a few hours all

the manganese is converted into peroxide ; the contents of the vessel are then run

off; the mud, now everywhere known as ' Weldon mud,' is settled, and the clear
liquor run to waste. The mud is then pumped into large closed stone stills, where

it meets with muriatic acid, chlorine is given off, and the residual liquor treated

as before.

You note that this process works without tiny manipulation, merely by the

circulation of liquids and thick magmas which are moved by pumping machinery.
As compared to older processes it also has the great advantage that it requires

very little time for completing the cycle of operations, so that large quantities of

chlorine can be produced by a very simple and inexpensive plant. These advan-

tages secured for this process the quite unprecedented success that within a few

years it was adopted, with a few isolated exceptions, by every large manufacturer

of chlorine in the world yet it possessed a distinct drawback, viz., that it pro-
                                                                                                                                      ;

duced considerably less chlorine from a given quantity of muriatic acid than either

native manganese of good quality or Mr. Dunlop's recovered manganese. At that

time, however, muriatic acid was produced as a by-product of the Le Blanc pro-

cess so largely in excess of what could be utilised that it was generally looked

upon as a waste product of no value. Mr. Weldon himself was one of the very
few who foresaw that this state of things could not always continue. The am-

monia soda process was casting its shadow before it. Patented in 1838 by Messrs.

Dyar and Hemming it was only after the lapse of thirty years (during which a

number of manufacturing chemists of the highest standing had in vain endeavoured

to carry it into practice) that this process was raised to the rank of a manufactur-

ing process through the indomitable perseverance of Mr. Ernest Solvay, of Brussels,

Aand his clear perception of its practical and theoretical intricacies.  few years
TRANSACT] ONS OF SECTION B.  739

later, in 1872, Mr. Weldon already gave his attention to the problem of obtaining

the chlorine of the salt used in this process in the form of muriatic acid. He pro-
posed to recover the ammonia from the ammonium chloride obtained in thi^

manufacture by magnesia instead of lime, thus obtaining magnesium chloride
instead of calcium chloride, and to produce muriatic acid from this magnesium

chloride by a process patented by Clemm in 1863, viz., by evaporating the solution,

heating the residue in the presence of steam, and condensing the acid vapours

given oflP.

     Strange to say, this same method had been patented by Mr. Ernest Solvny
within twenty-four hours before Mr. Weldon lodged his specification. It has
been frequently tried with many modifications, but has never been found practic-
able. Soon afterwards Mr. Weldon, with the object of reducing the muriatic acid
required by his first process, proposed to replace the lime in this process by mag-
nesia, and so to produce a manganite of magnesia. After treating this with
muriatic acid and liberating chlorine he proceeded to evaporate the residual
liquors to dryness, during which operation all the chlorine they contain would be
disengaged as hydrochloric acid and collected in condensers, while the dry residue,
after being heated to dull redness in the presence of air, would be reconverted

into manganite of magnesia.

     This process was made the subject of long and extensive experiments at the
works of Messrs. Gamble at St. Helens, but did not realise Mr. Weldon's expecta-
tions. It, however, led to some further interesting developments, to which 1 shall

refer later on.

     Those of you who were present at the last meeting of the British Association

in this city will remember that this Section had the advantage of listening to a
paper by Mr. Weldon on his chlorine process, and also to another highly interest-
ing paper by Mr. Henry Deacon of Widnes ' on a new chlorine process without

manganese.' And those of you who came with the then President of the Section

(Professor Roscoe) to Widnes to visit the works of Messrs. Gaskell, Deacon, and Co.
will well remember that at these works they saw side by side Weldon's process
and Deacon's process in operation, and no one present will have forgotten the
thoughtful, flashing eyes and impressive face of Mr. Deacon when he explained to
his visitors the theoretical views he had formed as regards his process.

     Mr. Deacon had made a careful study of thermo-chemistry, which had been
greatly developed during the preceding decade by the painstaking, accurate, and
comprehensive experiments of Julius Thomsen and of Berthelot, and had led the
latter to generalisations which, although not fully accepted by scientific men,
have been of immense service to manufacturing chemistr)'.

     Mr. Deacon came to the conclusion that, it' a mixture of hydrochloric acid with
atmospheric air was heated in the presence of a suitable substance capable of
initiating the interaction of these two gases by its affinity to both, it would to a
very great extent be converted into chlorine with the simultaneous formation of
steam, because the formation of steam from oxygen and hydrogen gives rise to the
evolution of a considerably larger quantity of heat than the combination of
hydrogen and chlorine. Mr. Deacon found that the salts of copper were a A'ery
suitable substance for this purpose, and took out a patent for this process in 1868.

He entrusted the study of the theoretical and practical problems connected with
this process to Dr. Ferdinand Hurter, who carried them out in a manner which

will always remain memorable, and will never be surpassed, as an example of the
application of scientific methods to manufacturing problems, and which soon
placed this beautiful and simple process on a sound basis as a manufacturing

operation.

   -- --In the ordinary course of manufacture the major part about two-thirds of

the hydrochloric acid is obtained mixed with air and a certain amount of steam, but
otherwise very little contaminated. Instead of condensing the muriatic acid from
this mixture of gases by bruiging it into contact with water, Mr. Deacon passed it
through a long series of cooling pipes to condense the steam, which of course
absorbed hydrochloric acid, and formed a certain quantity of strong muriatic
acid. The mixture of gases waa then passed through an iron superheater to raise
7iO EEPORT-- 1896.

it to the required temperature, and tlience through a mass of broken bricks im-
pregnated with sulphate or chloride of copper contained in a chamber or cylinder
called a decomposer, which was protected from loss of heat by being placed in a
brick furnace kept sufficiently hot. In this apparatus from 50 to 60 per cent, of
the hydrochloric acid in the mixture of gases was burnt to steam and chlorine. In
order to separate this chlorine from the steam and the remaining hydrochloric
acid the gases were washed with water, and subsequently with sulphuric acid.

The mixture now consisted of nitrogen and oxygen, containing about 10 -per cent,

of chlorine gas, which could be utilised without any difficulty in the manufacture
of bleach liquors and chlorate of potash, and which Mr. Deacon also succeeded
in using for the manufacture of bleaching powder, by bringing it into contact

in specially constructed chambers with large surfaces of hydrate of lime.
Within recent years this latter object has been attained in a more expeditious and
perfect manner by continuous mechanical apparatus (of which those constructed
by Mr. Kobert Hasenclever and Dr. Carl Langer have been the most successful),
in which the hydrate of lime is transported in a coutinuous stream by single or
double conveyors in an opposite direction to the current of dilute chlorine, and the
bleaching powder formed delivered direct into casks, thereby avoiding the intensely
disagreeable work of packing this offensive substance by hand.

     Mr. Deacon's beautiful and scientific process thus involves still less movement
of materials than the very simple process of Mr. Weldon, because in lieu of large
volumes of liquids he only moves a current of gas through his apparatus, wliich
requires a minimum of energy. The only raw material used for converting hydro-

chloric acid into chlorine is atmospheric air, the cheapest of all at our command.
The hydrochloric acid which has not been converted into chlorine by the process is

all obtained, dissolved in water, as muriatic acid, and is not lost, as in previous
processes, but is still available to be converted into chlorine by other methods, or
to be used for other purposes.

      In spite of these distinct advantages, this process took a long time before
it became adopted as widely as it undoubtedly deserved. This was mainly due to
the fact that the economy in the use of muriatic acid which it effected was at

the time when the process was brought out, and for many years afterwards, no
object to the majority of chlorine manufacturers, who were still producing more
of this commodity than they could use. Moreover, there were other reasons. The

plant required for this process, although so simple in principle, is very bulky
in proportion to the quantity of chlorine produced, and, as I have pointed out, the

process only succeeded in converting about one-third of the hydrochloric acid
produced into chlorine, the remainder being obtained as muriatic acid, which had in

most instances to be converted into chlorine by the Weldon process; so that the
Deacon process did not constitute an entirely self-contained method for this
manufacture. This defect, of small moment as long as muriatic acid was produced
in excessive quantities, was only remedied by an invention of Mr. Robert
Hasenclever a short number of years ago ; when by the rapid development of the
ammonia soda process the previously existing state of things had been completely
changed, and when, at least on the Continent, muriatic acid was no longer an
abundant and valueless by-product, but, on the contrary, the alkali produced
by the Le Blanc process had become a by-product of the manufacture of chlorine.
Mr. Hasenclever, in order to make the whole of the muriatic acid he produces avail-
able for conversion into chlorine by the Deacon process, introduces the liquid

muriatic acid in a continuous stream into hot sulphuric acid contained in a series

of stone vessels, through which he passes a current of air. He thus obtains

a mixture of hydrochloric acid and air, well adapted for the Deacon process,
the water of the muriatic acid remaining with the sulphuric acid, from which it

is subsequently eliminated by evaporation. In this way the chlorine in the

hydrochloric acid can be almost entirely obtained in its free state by the simplest
imaginable means, and with the intervention of no other chemical agent than
atmospheric air. Since their introduction the Deacon process has supplanted the

Weldon process in nearly all the largest chlorine works in France and Germany,
and is now also making very rapid progress in this country.
TRANSACTIO>"S OF SECTION B.  741

    Mr. Weldon, when lie decided to give up liis manganite of magnesia process,
by no means relaxed liis efforts to work out a chlorine process which should

utilise the whole of the muriatic acid. While working with manganite of
magnesia he found that magnesia alone would answer the purpose without the
presence of the peroxide of manganese. lie obtained the assistance of M. Pechiney,

of Salindres, and in conjunction with him worked out what has become known as
the ' Weldon-Pechiney ' process, which was first patented in 1884.

     This process consists in neutralising muriatic acid by magnesia, concentrating
the solution to a point at which it does not yet give off any hydrochloric acid, and
then mixing into it a fresh quantity of magnesia so as to obtain a solid oxychloride
of magnesium. This is broken up into small pieces, which are heated up rapidly to a
high temperature without contact with the heating medium, while a current of
air is passing through them. The oxychloride of magnesium containing a large
quantity of water, this treatment yields a mixture of chlorine and hydrochloric
acid with air and steam, the same as the Deacon process, and this is treated in a

very similar way to eliminate the steam and the acid from the chlorine. The acid

condensed is, of course, treated with a fresh quantity of magnesia, so that the
whole of the chlorine which it contains is gradually obtained in the free state.

     The rapid heating to a high temperature of the oxychloride of magnesium with-
out contact with the heating medium was an extremely difficult practical problem,
which has been solved by M. Pechiney and hia able assistant, M. Boulouvard, in a
very ingenious and entirely novel way.

     They lined a large wrought-iron box with fire-bricks, and built inside of this
vertical fire-brick walls with small empty spaces between them, thus forming a
number of very narrow chambers, so arranged that thej- could all be filled from
the top of the box, and emptied from the bottom. These chambers they heated to
a very high temperature by passing a gas flame through them, thus storing up in
the brick walls enough heat to cany out and complete the decomposition of the
magnesium oxychloride, with which the chamber was filled when hot enough.

     Mr. Weldon himself called this apparatus a ' baker's oven,' in which trade

certainly the same principle has been employed from time immemorial ; but to my

knowledge it had never before been used in any chemical industry. This process

has been at work at M. Pechiney's large alkali works at Salindres, and is now at
work in this country at the chlorate of potash works of Messrs. AUbright and

Wilson at Oldbury, a manufacture for which it offers special advantages. Mr.
Weldon and M. Pechiney had expected that this process would become specially

useful in connection with the ammonia soda process by preparing in the way pro-
posed by Mr. Solvay and Mr. Weldon in 1872 a solution of magnesium chloride

as a by-product of this manufacture, but instead of obtaining muriatic acid from

this solution by Olemm's process, to tre.at it by the new process, so as to obtain the
bulk of the chlorine at once in the free state. But M. Pechiney did no more suc-
 ceed than his predecessors in recovering the ammonia by means of magnesia in a

satisfactory way.

      Quite recently, however, it has been applied to obtain chlorine in connection

with the ammonia soda process by Dr. Pick, of Ozakowa, in Austria. He recovers

the ammonia, as usual, by means of lime, and converts the solution of chloride of
calcium, obtained by a process patented by Mr. Weldon in 1869, viz., by treatment
with magnesia and carbonic acid under pressure, into chloride of magnesium with
the formation of carbonate of lime. The magnesium chloride solution is then con-
centrated and treated by the Weldon-Pechiney process.

      I have repeatedly referred during this brief history to the great change which
has been brought about in the position of chlorine manufacture by the develop-
ment of the ammonia soda process, and have pointed out that the muriatic acid
which for a long time was the by-product of the Le Blanc process, without value,
thereby became gradually its main and most valuable product, while the alkali
became its by-product.

     I have told you how, very early in the history of this process, Mr. Solvay and

Mr. Weldon proposed means to provide for this contingency, and how Mr. Weldon

continued to improve these moans until the time of his death. Mr. Solvay, on his
742 REPORT-- 1896.

part, also followed up the subject with that tenacity and sincerity of purpose
which distinguish him, his endeavours being mainly directed to producing
chlorine direct from the chloride of calcium running away from his works by mix-
ino- it with clay and passing air through the mixture at very high temperatures,
thus producing chlorine and a silicate of calcium, which could be utilised in cement-

making. The very high temperatures required prevented, however, this process

from becoming a practical success.

     1 have already told you what a complicated series of operations Dr. Pick Las
lately resorted to in order to obtain the chlorine from this chloride of calcium.
Yet the problem of obtaining chlorine as a by-product of the ammonia soda process

presents itself as a very simple one.

     This process produces a precipitate of bicarbonate of soda and a solution of

chloride of ammonium by treating natural brine or an artificially made solution of
salt, in which a certain amount of ammonia has been dissolved, with carbonic acid.
In their original patent of 1838 Messrs. Dyar and Hemming proposed to evaporate
this solution of ammonium chloride and to distil the resulting dry product with

lime to recover the ammonia. Now all that seemed to be necessary to obtain the

chlorine from this ammonium chloride was to substitute another o.\ide for lime in
the distillation process, which would liberate tlie ammonia and form a chloride

which on treatment with atmospheric air would give off its chlorine and reproduce

the original oxide. The whole of the reactions for producing carbonate of soda

and bleaching powder from salt would thus be reduced to their simplest possible

form ; the solution of salt, as we obtain it in the form of brine direct from the soil,
would be treated with ammonia and carbonic acid to produce bicarbonate and

subsequently monocarbonate of soda ; the limestone used for producing the carbonic
acid would yield the lime required for absorbing the chlorine, and produce bleaching

powder instead of being run into the rivers in combination with chlorine in the
useless form of chloride of calcium ; and both the ammonia used as an intermediary

in the production of soda and the metallic oxide used as an intermediary in the

production of chlorine would be continuously recovered.

The realisation of this fascinating problem has occupied me for a great many
Ayears. In the laboratory I obtained soon almost theoretical results.
                                                                       very large

number of oxides and even of salts of weak acids were found to decompose

ammonium chloride in the desired way ; but the best results (as was to be clearlv

anticipated from thermo-chemical data) were given by oxide of nickel.

     "When, however, I came to carry this process out on a large scale, I met with
the most formidable difficulties, which it took many years to overcome successfully.

    The very fact that ammonium chloride vapour forms so readily metallic chlo-

rides when brought in contact at an elevated temperature with metals or oxides,

or even silicates, led to the greatest difficulty, viz., that of constructing apparatus

which would not be readily destroyed by it.

Amongst the metals we found that platinum and gold were the only ones not

attacked at all. Antimony was but little attacked, and nickel resisted very well if

not exposed to too high a temperature, so that it could be, and is being, used for

such parts of the plant as are not directly exposed to heat. The other parts of the
apparatus coming in contact with the ammonium chloride vapour I ultimately

succeeded in constructing of cast and wrought iron, lined with fire-bricks or

Doulton tiles, the joints between these being made by means of a cement consisting

of sulphate of baryta and waterglass.

After means had been devised for preventing the breaking of the joints

through the unequal expansion of the iron and the earthenware, the plant so

constructed has lasted very well.

Oxide of nickel, which had proved the most suitable material for the process in

the laboratory, gave equally good chemical results on the large scale, but occasion-

ally a small quantity of nickel chloride was volatilised through local over-heating,

Wewhich, however, was sufficient to gradually make up the chlorine conduits.

therefore looked out for an active material free from this objection. Theoretical

considerations indicated magnesia as the next best substance, but it was found that

the magnesium chloride formed was not anhydrous, but retained a certain amount
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B,  743

of the steam formed by the reaction, which gave rise to the formation of a con-

siderable quantity of hydrochloric acid on treatment with hot air. In conjunction
with Dr. Eschellman (who carried out the experiments for me), I succeeded in

reducing the quantity of this hydrochloric acid to a negligible amount by adding
to the magnesia a certain amount of chloride of potassium, which probably has the

effect of forming an anhydrous double chloride.

     This mixture of magnesia and potassium chloride is, after the addition of a
certain quantity of china clay, made into small pills in order to give a free and

regular passage throughout their entire mass to the hot air and other gases with

which they have to be treated. In order to avoid as far as possible the handling-

and consequent breaking of these pills, I vapourise the ammonium chloride in a

special apparatus, and take the vapours through these pills and subsequently pass

hot air through, and then again ammonium chloride vapour, and so on, without

the pills changing their place.

     The vapourisation of the ammonium chloride is carried out in long cast-iron

retorts lined with thin Doulton tiles, and placed almost vertically in a furnace
which is kept by producer gas at a very steady and regular temperature. These

retorts are kept nearly full with ammonium chloride, so as to have as much active
heating surface as possible. From time to time a charge of ammonium chloride is

introduced through a hopper at the top of these retorts, which is closed by a nickel

plug. The ammonium chloride used is very pure, being crystallised out from its
solution as produced in the ammonia soda manufacture by a process patented by

Mr. Gustav Jarmay, which consists in lowering the temperature of these solutions
considerably below 0° C. by means of refrigerating machinery. The retorts will

therefore evaporate a very large amount of ammonium chloride before it becomes

necessary to take out through a door at their bottom the non-volatile impurities which

accumulate in them. The ammonium chloride vapour is taken from these retorta

by cast-iron pipes lined with tiles and placed in a brick channel, in which they are kept

hot, to prevent the solidification of the vapour, to large upright wrought-iron cylin-
ders which are lined with a considerable thickness of fire-bricks, and are filled with
the magnesia pills, which are, from the previous operations, left at a temperature

of about 300° C. On its passage through the pills the chlorine in the vapours is

completely retained by them, the ammonia and water vapour formed pass on and
are taken to a suitable condensing apparatus. The reaction of the ammonium
chloride vapour upon magnesia being exo-thermic, the temperature of the pills
rises during this operation, and no addition of heat is necessary to complete it.
The temperature, however, does not rise sufficiently to satisfactorily complete th&
second operation, viz., the liberation of the chlorine and the re-conversion of the
magnesium chloride into magnesium oxide by means of air. This reaction is
slightly endo-thermic, and thus abrsorbs a small amount of heat, which has to be
provided in one way or another. I effect this by heating the pills to a somewhat
higher temperature than is required for the action of the air upon them, viz., tcv
'}00° C, by passing through them a current of a dry inert gas free from oxygen
 heated by a Siemens-Cowper stove to the required temperature. I use for this-
purpose the gas leaving the carbonating plant of the ammonia soda process.

      This current of gas also carries out of the apparatus the small amount of
 ammonia which was left in between the pills. It is washed to absorb this
 .ammonia, and after washing this ^'ame gas is passed again through the Siemens-
 Cowper stove, and thus constantly circulated through the apparatus, taking up the

heat from the stove and transferring it to the pills. When these have attained the

 required temperature, the hot inert gas is stopped and a current of hot air passed
 through, which has also been heated to 600° 0. in a similar stove. The air acts-
 rapidly upon the magnesium chloride, and leaves the apparatus charged with 18 to-
 SiOper cent, of chlorine and a small amount of hydrochloric acid. The chlorine-
 comes gradually down, and when it has reached about 3 per cent, the temperature-
 of the air entering the apparatus is lowered to 360° 0. by the admixture of cold
 air to the hot air from the stove , and the weak chlorine leaving the apparatus is

passed through a second stove, in which its temperature is raised again to 600° C,

 and passed into another cylinder full of pills which are just ready lo receive the

Ahot-air current.   series of four cylinders is required to procure the necessary

continuity for the process.

     The chlorine gas is washed with a strong solution of chloride of calcium,
which completely retains all the hydrochloric acid, and is then absorbed in an
apparatus invented by Dr. Carl Langer, by hydrate of lime, which is made to pass
by a series of interlocked transporting twin-screws in an opposite direction to the
current of gas, and produces very good and strong bleaching powder, in spite of
the varying strength of the chlorine gas. The hydrochloric acid absorbed by the
solution of calcium chloride can by heating this solution be readily driven out and

collected.

    This process has now been in operation on a considerable scale at our works at

"Winnington for several years, with constantly improving results, notably with

regard to the loss of ammonia, which has gradually been reduced to a small

amount. The process has fully attained my object, viz., to enable the ammonia

soda process to compete, not only in the production of carbonate of soda, but also

in the production of bleaching powder, with the Le Blanc process.

     Nevertheless, I have hesitated to extend tliis process as rapidly as I should
otherwise have done, because very shortlj^ after I had overcome all its difliculties,
entirely different methods from those hitherto employed for the manufacture of
chlorine were actively pushed forward in different parts of the globe, for which
great advantages were claimed, but the real importance and capabilities of which

were and are up to this date very difficult to judge. I refer to the processes for

producing chlorine by electrolysis.

    During the first decade of this century, Humphry Davy had by innumerable

experiments established all the leading facts concerning the decomposing action of

an electric current upon chemical compounds. Amongst these he was the first to
discover that solutions of alkaline chlorides, when submitted to the action of a
current, yield chlorine. His successor at the Royal Institution, Michael Faraday,
worked out and proved the fundamental law of electrolysis, known to everybody
as ' Faraday's Law,' which has enabled us to calculate exactly the amount of
current required to produce by electrolysis any definite quantity of chlorine.
NaturalW, since these two eminent men had so clearly shown the way, numerous
inventors have endeavoured to work out processes baaed on these principles for the

production of chlorine on a manufacturing scale, but only during the last few years

have these met with any measure of success.
     It has taken all this time for the classical work of Faraday on electro-mag-

netism to develop into the modern magneto-electric machine, capable of producing
electricity in sufficient quantity to make it available for chemical operations on a
large scale; for you must keep in mind that an electric installation sufficient to

light a large town will only produce a very moderate quantity of chemicals.
     In applying electricity to the production of chlorine various ways have been

followed, both as to the raw materials and as to the apparatus employed. While

most inventors have proposed to electrolyse a solution of chloride of sodium, and

to produce tliereby chlorine and caustic soda, I am not aware that up to this day

any quantity of caustic soda made by electrolysis has been put on to the market.
     Only two electrolytic works producing chlorine on a really large scale are in

operation to-day. Both electrolyse chloride of potassium, producing as a by-
product caustic potash, which is of very much higher value than caustic soda, and
of which a larger quantity is obtained for the same amount of current expended.

These works are situated in the neighbourhood of Stassfurt, the important centre
of the chloride of potassium manufacture. The details of the plant they employ
are kept secret, but it is known that they use cells with porous diaphragms of
special construction, for which great durability is claimed. There are at this
moment a considerable number of smaller works in existence, or in course of

erection in various countries, intended to carry into practice the production of

chlorine by electrolysis by numerous methods, differing mainly in the details of

the  cells  to  be  used but some of them         also  involving  what may be  called  new  prin-
                                               ;

ciples. The most interesting of these are the processes in which mercury is used

alternately as cathode and anode, and salt as electrolyte. They aim at obtaining
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.      745

in the first instance chlorine and an amalgam of sodium, and subsequently con-
verting the latter into caustic soda hy contact with water, which certainly has
the advantage of producing a very pure solution of caustic soda. Mr. Hamilton
Castner has carried out this idea most successfully by a very beautiful decomposing
cell, which is divided into various compartments, and so arranged that by slightly
rocking the cell the mercury charged with sodium in one compartment passes into
another, where it gives up the sodium to water, and then returns to the first com-
partment, to be recharged with sodium. His process has been at work on a
small scale for some time at Oldbury, near Birmingham, and works for carrying
it out on a large scale are now being erected on the banks of the Mersey, and also
in Germany and America.

     Entirely different from the foregoing, hut still belonging to our subject, are
methods which propose to electrolyse the chlorides of heavy metals (zinc, lead,

copper, &c.) obtained in metallurgical operations or specially prepared for the pur-

pose, among which the processes of Dr. Carl Hoepfner deserve special attention.
They eliminate from the electrolyte immediately both the products of electrolysis,
chlorine on one side and zinc and copper on the other, and thus avoid all secondary
reactions, which have been the great difficulty in the electrolysis of alkaline

chlorides.

      All these processes have, however, still to stand the test of time before a final
opinion can be arrived at as to the eflect they will have upon the manufacture of

chlorine, the history of which we have been following, and this must be my excuse

for not going into further details. I have endeavoured to give you a brief history

of the past of the manufacture of chlorine, but I will to-day not attempt to deal

with its future. Yet I cannot leave my subject without stating the remarkable

fact that every one of these processes which I have described to you is still at work
to this day, even those of Scheele and Berthollet, all finding a sphere of usefulness
under the widely varying conditions under which the manufacture of chlorine is
carried on in different parts of the world.

    Let me express a hope that a hundred years hence the same will be said of the
processes now emerging and the processes still to spring out of the inventor's mind.

Rapid and varied as has been the development of this manufacture, I cannot sup-
pose that its progress is near its end, and that Nature has revealed to us all her

secrets as to how to procure chlorine with the least expenditure of trouble and

energy. I do not believe that industrial chemistry will in future be diverted from

Athis Section and have to wander to Section under the tegis of applied electricity.

I do not believe that the easiest way of effecting chemical changes will ultimateiy

be found in transforming heat and chemical affinity into electricity, tearing up
chemical compounds by this powerful medium, and then to recombine their con-

stituents in such form as we may 'require them. I am sure there isplenty of scope

for the manufacturing chemist to solve the problems before him by purely chemi-
cal means, of some of which we may as little dream to-day as a few years ago it
could have been imagined that nickel would be extracted from its ores by means

of carbon monoxide.

of energy, the Rontgen rays, which have enabled us to see through doors and walls

and to look inside the human body ; which brings before us a new form of matter,
represented by Argon and Helium, which, as their discoverers, Lord Rayleigh and
Professor Ramsay, have now abundantly proved, are certainly elementary bodies,

inasmuch as they cannot be split up farther, but are not chemical elements, as they

--possess no chemical affinity and do not enter into combinations at a meeting at

which such astounding and unexpected secrets of nature are revealed to us, who

would call in doubt that, notwithstanding the immense progress pure and applied
sciences have made during this century, new and greater and farther-reaching
discoveries are still in store for ages to come ?

                1. On Reflected Waves in the Explosion of Gases.
         By Professor H. B. Dixon, E. H. Strange, and E. Graham.

     The authors exhibited some photographs which show the return sound-wave
produced by the explosion-wave in gases when it reaches the end of the tube. The
gases were fired in a thick glass tube closed by a steel plug. The flash was photo-

graphed on a very rapidly moving film. By measuring the velocity of these
sound-waves the authors estimate the maximum temperature of the gases immedi-
ately in the wake of the explosion-wave. The maximum temperatures lie between

3,000° and 4,000° C. They are thus of the same order as those given by Bunsen, by
Bertheiot, and by ISIallard and Le Chatelier for the temperature of the explosion itself.

2. T}ie Action of Metals and their Salts on Ordinary and on Rontgen

      Rays : a Contrast. By Dr. J. H. Gladstone and W. Hibbert.

     This paper is an extension of previous work on the special properties of metals
and salts, and may be considered as an application of Rontgen rays to chemical

research.

     In regard to the rays of ordinary light solid metals absorb them completely,
and are therefore opaque. If, however, the metals combine with an electro-
negative radicle, they lose their power of absorbing light, except a few which show
the phenomena of selective absorption. Solutions of salts resemble the crystallised
solid in their action on light.

     With regard to Rontgen rays, on the contrary, metals exhibit every degree of

-- --opacity or transparency, from lithium which is practically non-absorptive to

such metals as gold and platinum, which are practically opaque. The salts of
these metals are not transparent, but the metal in them seems to have the same
effect on the Rontgen rays as in the uncombined condition. This seems to be
equally true when the salts are dissolved in water.

     The order of absorption follows that of atomic weight, as found by Barrett and
others, not that of density or combining proportion. The absorption of the
Rontgen rays by a salt solution appears to be that of both constituents of the salt
added together plus that of the solvent.

     The work was principally carried on in the laboratory of the Polytechnic,
Regent Street, London. Photographs were exhibited.

3. Limiting/ Explosive Projjortions of Acetylene and Detection and Measure-

    ment of the Gas in the Air. By Professor Frank Clowes, D.Sc.

      (Lond.
                               )

     The value of acetylene as an illuminant and the discovery of its ready pro-
duction from calcium carbide have led to the manufacture of this gas in some
quantity, and acetylene will probably be dealt with in still larger volume in the
near future. It becomes, therefore, important to devise methods of detecting its
presence in the air, arising from leakage and escape, and to measure the percentage
of the gas present at any place. It is also important to ascertain what proportions
of the gas, when present in mixture with air, will lead to explosion if the mixture

should be kindled.
     The Detection of Small Proportions of the Gas will not be readily effected by

its smell when it is prepared in a state of purity ; at present the smell is made
much more pronounced by the impurities which the commercial gas contains.
Further, the smell will not in any case furnish a means of measuring the pro-
portion present in the air. The method applied by the writer to the detection
and measurement of fire-damp and coal-gas in the air, however, serves for

detecting and measuring acetylene as well. A small hydrogen flame jet to
                                                       --

either o or 10 mil! i metres in height, as may be necessary, shows a pale but well-

defined 'cap' in air containing any pi'oportion of acetylene less than the lowest

explosive proportion. When the hydrogen flame is exposed to the air to be tested

for acetylene in a darkened space, it is at once tinged yellowish-green. The

bluish pale cap has the following heights with varying proportions of acetylene

--when the hydrogen flame is 10 millimetres in height:

0'25 per cent, gives 17 mm. cap.

   A convenient portable form of apparatus was shown by the writer, which

enabled air to be passed readily over the standard hydrogen flame in a darkened

vessel, and which quickly furnished the reading of the height of the cap.
     In DeterminiiKj the Limits of Explosibiliti/, when acetylene is mixed in

gradually increasing proportion with air and kindled, the writer adopted a simple
method referred to at the last meeting of the Association. It was found that air

must contain at least 3 per cent, of acetylene before it can be kindled by a flame

and the mixture caused to burn throughout. As the proportion of acetylene is
increased, the explosive character is augmented. When 22 per cent, of acetylene

is present, carbon begins to separate during the burning. The amount of carbon
which separates increases until the explosive character of the mixture disappears

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

this point is reached when 82 per cent, of acetylene is present in the air.

     The limiting percentages in air which are explosible are accordingly as follows,
and may be compared with those already determined by the writer for other
combustible gases : --

    5. On the Amides of the Alkali Metals and some of their Derivatives
                        By A. AV. TiTHERLEY, M.Sc, Ph.D.

    Ammonia, by the substitution of one atom of hydrogen by the alkali metals,

gives rise to a series of amides of interesting properties. The following were
prepared : sodamide, NaNH., potassamide, KNH,> ; lithamide, LiNH^ ; and rubid-

                                                                                                                                        ;

amide, RbNH,,. The metals, on heating in ammonia, rapidly decompose it, form-

ing the respective amides, especially lithium, whose action is very energetic.

The amides are white crystalline substances, easily decomposed by water. On

heating they distil or sublime without decomposition, except at high temperatures,

when they split partially into their elements. No nitrides result, although these

were stated by Davy to be formed by heating the impure sodamide and potass-

--amide he obtained his results having been vitiated by the glass vessels employed.

The melting-points of the amides are very different, and bear no connection

apparently with the atomic weights of the metals. Several substitution deri-
Hvatives were exhibited, obtained by replacing the
                                                                                                 atom of the NHo gi'oup by

    2. The Retardation of Chemical Reaction from Diminution of Space.

                          By Professor Oscar Liebreich.

    This subject may be regarded from the point of view either of Chemistry or of

Physics, as it occupies a position on the borderland between those sciences.

   We know that some of the phenomena of motion in capillary tubes differ from

those in larger vessels filled with liquid. The melting-point is higher, the freezing-
point is lower, the boiling-point is retarded. Of the phenomena of motion which

go by the name of chemical reaction we know as yet nothing, for the condensa-

tion of gases in finely pulverised substances also belongs to purely physical

phenomena.

    This investigation arose out of a previous examination of chloral hydrate,

the decomposition of which into chloroform takes place according to a well-known

formula.

     Under certain conditions this, substance undergoes a molecular change. If the

-- --melted crystals in appearance a matted mass of needles are placed in benzene,

isolated glassy-hard needles are obtained. The most varied experiments, made

for the purpose of discovering whether a different chemical substance had been

formed, proved unavailing ; but there was certainly a change as far as physical quali-

ties were concerned. The matted needle-mass dissolved in water without increase

of  volume                                       while in the  case  of  the  isolated  needles  an  increase  of  volume  was
                                              ;

proved. No chemical difference being observed, the author endeavom'ed to find

out whether both substances were alike in the velocity of reaction.

    When soda solutions are mixed with solutions of chloral hydrate, the chloro-

form dogs not separate out in oily drops, but forms a nebula of chloroform iu the
                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                    749

liquid. The microscope, too, shows only a mass of minute spots. If the liquid is

sufficiently diluted, the nebula does not form till after some minute.'?. The shape

of this nebula induced the author to study that part in the fluid, where chemical

reaction is considerably retarded, which he calls the 'dead space.'

If the solution be poured into a test tube, a space below the surface remains

clear and transparent. The first thought cannot fail to be, that this phenomenon

is caused either by sedimentation of the nebula, or by evaporation of the chloro-

form, or indeed by both. But the shape of the nebula reveals to the observer that

these cannot be the true causes. If sedimentation were the cause, the nebuia

would be lowest in the middle ; in evaporation, on the other hand, the same quan-
tity of vapour would rise from every part of the surface, and thus the shape would

be dififerent from the one actually seen. For in reality the nebula shows the shape

of an arch convex to the surface.

In order to observe this phenomenon more closely, a glass prism with an acute

angle was used. Here the appearance was remarkable. Under the surface there

was a clear space deflected in the direction of the acute angle and corresponding

to the depth of the meniscus downwards, a space which even inside the angle was

perfectly clear.

The ' dead space ' can be seen in the synthesis of indigo from orthonitrobenz-

aldehyde, but the reaction is a very rapid one, and for this reason the experiments

were made with iodic acid and sulphurous acid ; 25 grammes iodic acid per litre

--and 0-88 gramme sulphurous acid per litre the latter being the solution used by
ALandolt for his time-reactions.
                                   starch-solution demonstrates the presence of free

iodine. Both in the test tube and in the prism the same phenomena of ' dead

space ' can be observed as in the case of the chloral-hydrate reaction. This

mixture is suited to vessels of the most varied shapes, as shown by experiments of

a decisive nature. For instance, a tumbler is filled with the reacting mixture, and

some of the liquid aspirated into a glass tube. The reaction first commences in

the tumbler, and afterwards in the glass tube, and in its central line only. The

column of coloured fluid reaches below the meniscus. As in this case the space

free from reaction cannot be explained either by evaporation or by sedimentation,

it follows that the glass wall and the surface of the fluid may cause the ' dead
space.' The experiments may be modified by using a tube composed of hollow

glass bulbs connected by capillary tubes. The reaction is then visible in the

centre of the bulbs, while the liquid in the connecting capillary tubes remains per-

fectly clear. The following experiment was made to prove the retardation of
Areaction in capillary tubes.
                                   tumbler and a capillary tube were filled with

colourless reacting-fluid, and the latter was introduced into the tumbler-fluid.

After the blue reaction had taken place in the tumbler the capillary tube was

taken out. Its contents were found to have remained colourless. But when a

similar capillary tube was filled with the blue fluid, the blue colour could be dis-

tinctly seen. Tubes which had been blown into bulbs were also filled with the

reacting fluid, and it was observed that the reaction began in the centre of the

bulb.

    An instructive demonstration of the 'dead space' and its formation is made by

fixing a drop of the reacting fluid between the convex faces of two watf-h-glasses.

If the reaction be then watched from above, there is nothing extraordinary in the

fact that the blue colour grows fainter as it approaches the centre, until at last it
disappears entirely. But if, by means of an apparatus similar to those attached to

microscope tables, one of the watch-glasses be raised, a sharply defined, colourless,

and transparent patch is visible in the centre. Moreover, there is a dead space,

not only in the centre of the drop, but also at its circumference, along the stretched

surface of the fluid.

     These experiments were variously modified in order to leave no doubt that the
phenomena were not produced either by evaporation, by sedimentation, or by the

alkalinity of the glass.

    An experiment was then devised in which these three factors were completely

eliminated by means of the reaction occurring in the reduction of sesquichloride of

i;old with formate of soda. The formate of soda, again, was formed by decom-

position of chloral hydrate with a solution of carbonate of soda. These solutions
were used in the following proportions :

                   50 com. -. solution of chloral hydrate were mixed with

                    4 com. ^ solution of carbonate of soda,
                                    o

and three drops of a solution of sesquichloride of gold (1-5 per cent.) added. At a

temperature of about '22° the reaction takes place, the so-called liquid gold sepa-

rates out in the form of a violet solution. With this solution, and with the appa-

ratus described, it is not difficult to find reactions which form the ' dead space.'
Care must be taken, however, to exclude direct solar rays.

     The 'dead space ' is probably caused by internal resistance of the fluid. In a
liquid, inclosed by a hard wall, the motion of the liquid will be the more hindered
by the friction produced by this motion itself the smaller the vessel is. Not that,
of course, any change is assumed in- the coefficient, but the conclusion seems
inevitable that the smaller the space inclosing a iluid, the more nearly the fluid

resembles a solid as regards its internal resistance.

     The same must hold good in the case of an inclosed fluid, where the upper wall
is bounded by the surface-tension of the fluid, and also in the case of a fluid
bounded only by its own stretched circumference i.e., the case of the drop.

     This view of the change in the physical qualities of fluids is illustrated by some

friction-experiments.

     It a small disk-shaped float, having the smallest possible upward pressure, be
allowed to rise in a glass vessel, it will be seen to come to an apparent staudstill
half a millimetre below the surface, and then to rise to the surface with greatly
diminished velocity ; a proof that there is friction on the fluid side of the stretched

surface.

     The second experiment consists in allowing a concentrated coloured glycerine-

solution to rise in a colourless glycerine-solution of slightly greater density. If a
glass tube, fitted at its upper part with a prism filled with'the heavier solution, be
used, the current of the liquid shows the direction taken by the 'dead space,' and

thus indicates the places at which the fluid-resistance is at its maximum.
     Thus we are brought to the conclusion that liquid friction is of influence in

--the phenomenon of chemical reaction, and that in small inclosed spaces spaces in
--which the fluid is, as it were, solidified the reaction is retarded.

     It is worthy of consideration whether these observations have not an important
bearing also in relation to biological processes.

     Attention has long since been directed by the chemist and physiologist alike
to the question whether there are not modes of reaction in the limited spaces of
organisms diri'ering from those observed hitherto in the larger vessels of the chemical

laboratory.

     The results given tend to show that the small space of the cells is not
accidental, but that it has a function either to moderate or to stimulate
chemical reactions, or even to determine their direction otherwise than in larger

A (>ssels.

     Chemical reaction, thus modified, may well play an important role in cells, and

it is hoped that not only in pure chemistry, but also in the chemistry of vital

phenomena, further investigations on the lines suggested may lead to important

 results.

5, On the Velocity of Reaction before Perfect Eqtiilibrium takes place.
                           By Meyer Wildermann.

As we know, there are two kinds of equilibrium : perfect and imperfect.

Gibbs gives us the rule for distinguishing the two kinds : when n kinds of mole-

cules constitute n + 1 phases or parts of a system, the equilibrium is a perfect one

and when n kinds of molecules constitute a system of less than « + 1 phases, the

equilibrium is an imperfect one. To perfect equilibrium belong first the so-called

' physical ' reactions, where one and the same substance is in dift'erent states of

aggregation, thus forming different parts or phases of the heterogeneous system

e.g., where solid and liquid or gas, liquid and solid or gas, &c., are in equilibrium.

To perfect equilibrium belongs also the great range of ' chemical ' reactions, which
have the common feature with the physical, that to a given temperature only a

certain pressure corresponds at which the system can be in equilibrium, and the

phases may change in their mass but not in their constitution e.g., the system

OaCOg and CaO, C0,,, &c. The velocity of reaction before imperfect equilibrium

takes place (in homogeneous systems) was thoroughly investigated by Wilhelmy,

Harcourt and Esson, Gouldberg and Waage, van 't Hoff, and others. But as the

velocity of reaction before perl'ect equilibrium takes place has remained to the

present time a large and scarcely known field, and the few investigations which have

been carried out have not led to any simple results or quantitative conclusion, the

author has been induced to make the following investigation.

1. Velocity of solidification of liquids and solutions (phenol and solutions of

water in phenol). The author has investigated the velocity of solidification of

phenol and of solutions of water in phenol in a U-tube, one part of which was

replaced by a narrow tube of very thin platinum ; the U-tube was immersed in

"baths of diflTerent temperatures below the melting-point. By good arrangement

for stirring, the temperature of the bath was kept constant within the limits of

A0°05 C. The time was observed to a ^ second.  fine, very sensitive thermo-

meter was placed in the platinum tube to measure the rise of temperature of the

liquid while the reaction takes place (the rise equals more than 40 per cent, of the

total value of overcooling to -- toi). If abscissae represent the amount of overcool-

iug below the melting-point, and ordinates, the velocities of reaction, or the time

required for the passage of the solidified mass from one end of the platinum tube

to the other, we obtain straight lines, cutting the melting-point (instead of the

irregular curves of Gernez or Moore, Avhich cut the abscissae considerably below

--the melting-point) /.e., the equation '^-=e(f,,-^), (1.), where s is the time, to is

the temperature of equilibrium, holds good. The surface of the solid in contact

with the liquid remaining the same, the velocity of reaction is directly proportional

to the remoteness from the melting-point.

2. Velocity of reaction before equilibrium between liquid and solid solutions

takes place (solidification of phenol and meta-cresol). It was found that phenol
and OT-cresol form solid solutions. The «(-cresol is partly dissolved in the liquid

phenol, partly in the separated solid phenol, following the laws of van 't Hoff,
The velocities in a U-tube have been investigated, and the author finds that ihe

equation (1.) holds good.

3. Velocity of crystallisation of overcooled liquids and solutions (the solid

solvent is in equilibrium with the liquid solvent or solution). In the case of

crystallisationonly a part of the liquid becomes solid as far as necessary to bring

it to the freezing temperature. The method used is based on the principle that

the heat freed during the reaction is as completely as possible absorbed by the

liquid. Good arrangements for stirring are required. The cooling of the liquid

stirred by the surrounding medium must be so small that it may be neglected or

Aonly a small correction required (1,250 c.c. liquid is used, -t,, 1 is kept small).

very sensitive 1/100° thermometer is of first importance (with a long thin bulb as

thin as possible). The time was         observed to J second. From           the results obtained

holds good; therefore the equation ~=c(t-t^,,) --{to t), (2.), where t^^, is the tem-

perature to which the liquid was overcooled, to is the freezing-point, holds good,

i.e., the velocity of reaction is directly proportional to the surface of the solid in

contact with the liquid, and to the remoteness from the freezing temperature. The
condition is t -- to^>Q, i.e., the solid solvent is present in the liquid, and the system

is heterogeneous.
     4, Velocity of melting of solid solvents in liquid solvents or solutions (e.ff., of

ice in water or aqueous solutions). The velocity of ice melting cannot be
measured with the same accuracy as the velocity of ice separation. The author

--has carried out experimental verification of the equation --= c{f,, f), where c is

                                                                                                 dz
directly proportional to the surface of the solid in contact with the liquid, by using

cubes of ice, whose surface could be directly measured at the heginning and at the
end of the reaction, and during the reaction it could he calculated from the fall of
temperature of the investigated hquid.

     6. Velocity of crj^stallisation of oversaturated solution (equilibrium between
separated salt and salt solution). The equation (2.) holds good i.e., the velocity
of reaction is directly proportional to the surface of the salt in contact with the liquid
and to the amount of oversaturation (not to the total quantity of the salt dissolved).
This very remarkable fact throws light on the meaning of the velocity of reaction
before perfect equilibrium. Let us assume that the total quantity of the salt dissolved

-- --takes place in the reaction, then our equation will be =c(t^ t)A, where --t^ t

Ais directly propoitifmal to the surface of the separated crystals, is the concen-

tration of the liquid part of the time s. This equation can he written in the form

--=-j^ c(^i t) (A' + a), where A' is the concentration at equilibrium and a is the

amount of oversaturation at the time s. Now ^(f , - f)jV = independently of the
value --t^ t, since the concentration A' is in equilibrium with any quantity of the

salt present in the liquid. The only equation for the reaction is therefore

----j^ = c(/i t)a i.e., the equation given above.

      Since in the case of perfect equilibrium one of the parts of the heterogeneous
systein can conqilefely disappear (with the change of the temperature or of the
pressure of equilibrium), it follows that above or below the point of equilibrium

no opposite reaction occurs, and because of this when ^ becomes zero, the equili-

                                                                                                  dz

brium is a static one (and not a dynamic one, as assumed).

   We thus find that one and the same equation represents the relations of all

investigated reactions before perfect equilibrium. The equation is therefore
general, and must be put at the basis of all other reactions of more complicated
form (which will form the subject of further investigation).

      Static equilibrium because of the interference of other factors is never in reality

reached in nature. The equilibrium is never real or perfect, but only apparent.

A detailed investigation of this in the case of equilibrium between ice and water

or solution is given in the author's paper 'On the real and apparent freezing-point
and the freezing-point methods.' This gives us the possibility of explaining some of
the most important phenomena in nature, &c., as the formation of glaciers, icebergs,
snow, the melting processes, &c. All these phenomena never completely reach

the dead-point of perfect equilibrium, but a continuous change or reaction takes
place in nature.

                6. The Behaviour of Litmus in Amijhoteric Solutions.

                     By Thomas R. Bradsiiaw, B.A., M.D.

     Solutions which redden blue litmus, and at the same time turn red litmus blue,
are said to have an amphoteric {aiKpa ripas) reaction. This reaction is always

f;iveu by human urine when its acidity is low, and is in this case due to the exist-
eucu together of the dihydric and mouohydric phosphates, MIL, PO^ and M^ HPO^,

of -which the former acts as an acid and the latter as an alkali towards litmus.

The actual colour resulting is violet. No satisfactory explanation has been otiered
of the nature of the change in the litmus when the violet is produced. Ileintz '

supposed that litmus was of the nature of a diabasic acid, the red pigment con-
taining two atoms of displaceahle hydrogen, which in the blue litmus were replaced

by a metal. He supposed that the monohydric and dihydric phosphates displaced

only one atom of hydrogen or of metal, forming a body analogous to an acid salt

the violet litmus. He seems to have overlooked the fact that the violet litmus is

--only produced when both phosphates act together alone they produce red and

blue litmus.

     The object of the present communication is to show that the violet litmus is a
mechanical mixture of the red and the blue. It can be shown on theoretical

grounds that when both phosphates are present in nearly equal proportions they
must each affect the litmus in their own special way, the exact amount of blue and

red produced being determined by the mass action of the phosphates. If red

LHlitmus is provisionally represented by the formula  the reactions may be repre-

sented as follows :

 Mn M,,H PO4 + n H, PO, + 2L = (« - 1) M,HrO, + (ra + 1) iMH.PO^ + LH + LM.
n M,H PO, + tjMIL PO4 + 2 LM = {n + 1) MZHPO^ + (« - 1) MH.: PO^ + LM + LII.

The violet litmus is shown to be a mixture of the red and the blue by observing

the light transmitted through its solution by the eye and by the spectroscope.

This light is, in all respects identical with that transmitted through the red and

the blue successively. Cochineal behaves in an analogous manner.

It can be shown that acetic acid behaves in a manner analogous to litmus in

Apresence of the two phosphates.   small quantity of sodium acetate is added to

a strong solution of NaH, PO^ and Na^H PO^. On distilling the solution free

acetic acid comes over. The solution is then taken to dryness, the residue dis-

solved in water and acidulated with a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid. On

distilling a further quantity of acetic acid comes over. Thus it appears that

sodium acetate behaves in a manner analogous to blue litmus in the amphoteric

solutions. To sum up :

     1. There is no evidence to show that any special modification of litmus is pro-
duced by amphoteric solutions.

     2. Tlie violet litmus is a mixture of the red and the blue.
     3. The amount of the two forms of litmus in the amphoteric solution is deter-
mined by the mass action of the two kinds of phosphate.

7. Constitution of Sun Yelloiv or Curcumine, and Allied Colouring
         Matters. By Arthur G. Green and Andre Wahl.

When caustic soda or caustic potash is added to a hot concentrated solution of

paranitrotoluene-ortho-sulplionate of soda the liquid becomes at first bluish red,

then changes to orange and deposits a thick orange-yellow precipitate (Walter,

'Bull. Soc. Mulhouse,' 1887, 09). The yellow colouring-matter thus formed, which
is known in commerce as curcumine, sun yellow, &c., and dyes unmordanted

cotton orange-yellow shades of considerable fastness to light and other agents,

appears to consist for the most part of a body to which the constitution of an

azoxy-stilbenedisulphonic acid

by Fischer and Ilepp (;Ber.,' 26, 2231 ; 28, 2281). It had long been known that
by the action of caustic alkalies upon an alcoholic solution of paranitrotoluene a
sparingly soluble red condensation product was formed, to which no satisfactory
formula could be assigned (Klinger, 'Ber.,' 15, 866 ; 16, 941). It was shown by

Bender and Schultz that this condensation product on reduction gave diamido-
stilbene whilst curcumine on reduction gave diamidostilbenedisulphonic acid, and
that hence both products are probably stiilbene derivatives.

     In 1888 it was discovered by Bender that by condensing paranitrotoluene sul-
phonic acid with caustic soda in presence of weak reducing agents such as alcohol,
glycerol, glucose, &c., colouring-matters were obtained possessing similar properties
to curcumine, but dyeing redder shades of orange and dissolving in concentrated
sulphuric acid with a violet or blue colour instead of a red (Eng. Pat. 2664 of 1888).
It was subsequently found that these colouring-matters (so-called Mikado oranges)
were also formed by the action of mild reducing agents, such as ferrous hydrate
upon the primary condensation product (curcumine).

     Neither of the two formula which have been proposed for curcumine gives a
satisfactory explanation of its properties and reactions They aflord, for instance,
no explanation of the dye-stutf character, the great stability towards oxidising
agents, or of the difficulty of reduction to diamido-stilbene disulphonic acid. Both
formulte are based upon determinations of the quantity of hydrogen required to
reduce the colour to its leuco compound, to which an hydrazo constitution

              XH : CHy

is attributed. According to Bender 4 atoms of hydrogen are required, whilst

Fischer and Hepp find 6 atoms. In order to clear up this discrepancy Bender's

experiments were repeated exactly according to his directions, but using the free
acid of curcumine instead of the sodium salt. In agreement with Bender 4 atom*
of hydrogen were found to be required. Since, however, the properties of the

substance in no way correspond with those of an azoxy compound, and the equation

                       2C,H3(CH3)(NO.,)(S03Na) = C, ,H,N,,0(S0j,Na)2 + 3HjO

would indicate the formation of a body having 9 atoms of hydrogen less than

Bender's formula, we have been led to seek another formula more in accordance

with the facts.

     It may be supposed that the first action of caustic soda upon paranitrotoluene

sulphonicacid consists in an intramolecular oxidation giving rise to dinitrosostilbene

disulphonic acid. The two nitrogen atoms may now enter the opposite rings,
forming an unstable compound

This latter formula would therefore represent the constitution of the pure Mikado

(readily reoxidised in air)

--[N.B. The crosses indicate the position of the HSO3 groups.]

The above formulae would explain the difficulty found in reducing curcumine to

diamidostilbene disulphonic acid, also the extreme oxidisability of the leuco com-
pound in air, a property cliaracteristic ol all azines, oxazines, thiazines, &c. ; and,
moreover, by representing these compounds as derivatives of an ortho-quinone,
would account for their dye-stuff properties.

     It is probable that a similar constitution must be assigned to chloramine orange,
which is formed by oxidation of diamidostilbene disulphonic acid with sodium
hypochlorite, and to Chicago orange obtained by caustic soda condensation of
paranitrotoluene sulphonic acid with benzidine.

   --An analogous constitution is also suggested in the case of another class of

colours namely, the yellow, direct-dyeing, cottcn-colouring matters which are
obtained by the oxidation of amidothiazols such as primuline and dehydrothioto-
juidine sulphonic acid. These colouring- matters, known in commerce as oxyphenine,
chloramine yellow, chlorophenine, &c., present great analogy with the curcumine
colours in their fastness to light, acids, and alkalies and in their cheoiical properties.

     In order to determine the amount of oxygen required for their formation pure

dehydrothiotoluidine sulphonic acid was oxidised with a known quantity of sodium
hypochlorite both in the cold and at 80° C. The excess of hypochlorite was deter-

9. Nitrates : Their Occurrence and Mamifacture. By William Newton.

     The world's chief supply of nitrate is that of the northern provinces of Chili.
The nitrate here occurs in a narrow band, following the eastern foot of the coast-

line of hills at an elevation of .3,000 to 4,000 feet, and at a distance in a direct

line from the sea varying from fifteen to thirty-five miles, extending from Pisagua

in the north, to Antofagasta in the south, about 250 miles.

Owing to its rainless condition, this plain is almost absolutely devoid of growing

vegetation. Previous vegetation there has been in abundance, as shown" by the

remains of forests, a few inches below the surface, in addition to which large

quantities of organic matter are carried down by mountain floods. The decom-

position of this organic matter forms nitrate in the ordinary way, but the nitrate

has no growing vegetation to absorb it, and is therefore carried in solution by the

drainage waters of the west side of the Andes, which are always percolating under

the surface of the plain, and, at periods of about eight or nine years, even com-

pletely flood it. These waters collect at the lower side of the plain against the

coast-hills, and there evaporate under the hot, dry atmosphere.

The crude nitrate is found under a layer of a few inches of blown dust. The

first layer of nitrate-bearing strata is extremely bard rock, containing from 10 to

20 per cent, of nitrates                                                                                                            this rock varies from a few inches in thickness to 16 and

contains sometimes as much as 70 to 80 per cent, of nitrate. This layer also

varies in thickness up to 7 feet. In the extraction the boring is continued "through

this, and the whole mass is upheaved by blasting powder made on the spot.

The rock nitrate is neglected, and the cahche carted away to the crushers,

thence to large iron boiling-tanks, a favourite shape of which is 32 feet by 6 feet

broad, and 9 feet deep. In these are five coils of steam pipes, and the boiling is

done by steam at about 50 lb. pressure. The boiling tanks are connected in
series of six, so as to allow of proper lixiviation. The liquor of the tanks is run
oft" at 112° Tw. It then contains about 80 lb. of nitrate to the cubic foot, of
which it deposits 40 lb. at '25° C. The mother liquor, containing- sometimes over
2 grammes of iodine to the litre, is pumped up to the iodine house, where it is
treated with bisulphate of soda, and, after the deposition of the iodine, is, of

course, used over again in the solution of the nitrate.

     The total production of nitrate from June 1885 to June 1886 in Chili was

1,218,000 tons.

     In the year 1853 Ragsky examined the gas of a spring in Peschtoldsdorf, near
Vienna, and obtained tlie following results :

     Last year the author made a new analysis of this gas, which showed figures

but little deviating from the above-mentioned analysis

     After argon had been discovered by Rayleigh and Ramsay, it was probable

that this gas, consisting almost entirely of nitrogen, also contained argon.

     To determine this, a larger quantity of the gas (about 12 litres) was collected
and, for further examination, was dried by sulphuric acid and chloride of calcium.
The gas was passed through a glowing tube, which was half filled with copper

netting, half Avith oxide of copper.

     Leaving this tube, the gas had to pass through two soda lime and two calcium
chloride conductors, in order to absorb the water formed, and was afterwards
passed over quicksilver into a gasometer of Ehrenberg.

     In order to remove the nitrogen, glowing magnesium was used in an apparatus,
which in principle is similar to that of Schlosing fils.

     It was found of considerable advantage to use three glowing tubes with mag-
nesium. Under these circumstances an experiment which was carried out with
about two litres of the gas took seven hours before the whole of the nitrogen was
absorbed, and for a long time a high pressure on the manometer was to be
observed. Consequently the gas in the apparatus was led oft" into an eudiometer.

Now the gas containing the supposed argon, with traces of nitrogen and hydrogen,

was freed from these gases by known methods.

     After an experiment, it was found that the gas thus obtained was mixed with
a large quanity of hydrogen. The original gas having been absolutely dry, the
hydrogen coidd have had its origin in the magnesium only, as this material was
cleaned by distillation in a stream of hydrogen, at which operation considerable
quantities of this gas are absorbed (after Dumas).

     In another experiment a dry tube filled with pentoxide of phosphorus was
introduced into the hot conductor, to remove the hydrogen formed in the mag-
nesium tube by oxidising it with copper oxide and absorbing the water formed.

     The gas thus cleaned was put into Pliicker's tuhes at the glass technical Insti-

     The examination of the gas by spectral analysis was made by Professors Eder
and Valenta with their concave grating.

     The result of this examination was an absolute conformity of the spectrum of
the gas isolated by the author with Lord Rayleigh's normal spectrum of argon
determined by Eder.

     The author concluded by expressing the great pleasure he had in making this
communication upon argon in the land of its birth, and in the presence of one of its

distinguished discoverers.

C. A Modified Form of Schrotter's Apparatus for the Determ,ination of
          Carbonic Anhydride. By Charles A. Kohn, Ph.D., B.Sc.

     Of the many forms of apparatus for the estimation of carbonic anhydride by
loss, that devised by Schriitter is probably most widely in use. Compared with
 other forms, it is certainly more handy than Bunsen's apparatus, although the
 latter is more accurate, since it contains an absorption tube charged with dehy-

drated copper sulphate on pumice in addition to calcium chloride. In a modified
Bunsen apparatus described by A. Christomanos (' Ber.,' 1894, 27, 2748), the drying
tube is replaced by a small wash bottle containing concentrated sulphuric acid

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

 the advantages of the latter over calcium chloride as a drying agent are pointed
out. But this modified form suffers from the same disadvantage as the ordinarv
Schrcitter apparatus in not making any special provision for the absorption of
hydrochloric acid gas which is evolved whenever hydrochloric acid is employed in
the decomposition of a carbonate. This is a well-recognised source of error, and it
is customary to attach a tube charged with dehydrated copper sulphate on pumice
to the sulphuric acid bulb of the ordinary Schrotter apparatus in order to effect
the complete absorption of the hydrochloric acid gas. With this addition, very
reliable results can he obtained, but the method of attachment of the additional

tube is always more or less clumsy. The object of the present modification is to
overcome this, and the new form has two additional advantages. The apparatus
is more stable, and the copper sulphate tube can be easily turned through any
angle, so as to attach the indiarubher tubing for drawing air through the
apparatus, after heating to drive out the carbonic anhydride and allowing to cool.
The pumice containing the dehydrated copper sulphate is held in place by a plug
of glass wool, and the ground glass stopper below it keeps well in its place if

attached, which is run by a single secondary cell with a capacity of 25 ampere

hours. The drum revolves twice per minute, the gearing being so arranged that

about 15 cubic feet of air or other gas can be drawn through the absorbing tower

ness and continuity. The single cell is sufficient to run the meter for thirty hours.

The following Papers and Heport were read :

1. The Detection and Estimation of Carbon Monoxide in Air.

                          By Dr. J. Haldane.

This method for the determination of small percentages of carbonic oxide in

air depends on the following facts :
     Haemoglobin, the colouring matter of blood, readily combines to form similar

compounds with both oxygen and carbonic oxide. Both compounds are disso-
ciated in a vacuum, but the carbonic oxide compound (or carboxyhaemoglobin)
is much more stable than the oxygen compound (or oxyhaemoglobin). In presence
of a gas mixture containing both oxygen and carbonic oxide a mixture of carboxy-
hsemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin is formed ; and the proportions in which the
haemoglobin divides itself between the oxygen and carbonic oxide depends on the

ratios of the percentage of oxygen to that of carbonic oxide multiplied by a
constant. Hence if the percentage of oxygen in the gas mixture be known, as in

the case of ordinary air, the percentage of carbonic oxide can be inferred if the

proportions be known in which haemoglobin brought into contact with the mixture
divides itself between the two gases. Now, it is extremely easy to determine these

proportions colorimetrically by taking advantage of the fact that in dilute solution

carboxyhaemoglobin has a pink colour, while oxyhaemoglobin is yellow. By adding

a certain amount of dilute carmine solution to oxyhaemoglobin solution, the tint
of carboxyhaemoglobin solution can be exactly reproduced. In the case of a
mixture of oxyhaemoglobin and carboxyhaemoglobin, the less the proportion of the
latter present the less will be the amount of carmine required ; and from the
amount of carmine needed the proportion of carboxyhaemoglobin can easily be

estimated.

AThe author then described the process in its simplest form.  solution of blood

is first prepared of such strength as to show the difference of tint between oxy-

haemoglobin and carboxyhaemoglobin ; a suitable dilution can easily be guessed from
Athe depth of colour. About 1 in 100 is very good.
                                                    solution of carmine of a

con-esponding or slightly greater depth of colour (about -01 per cent.) is also pre-

pared. The carmine is dissolved in a minimum of ammonia, and then diluted down.
     The sample of air to be examined should be collected in a small, dry, and

clean bottle of 100 or 200 c.c. capacity, and closed with a cork soaked in paraffin

wax. This bottle is opened under the blood solution in a basin, and about 5 c.c.

of air allowed to bubble out, so as to introduce a corresponding quantity of
--7 GO REPORT 1896.

litemoglobin solution into the bottle. The bottle is then recorked, removed from

the basin, and shaken for ten minutes, so that a maximum saturation with carbonic
oxide may be attained. During the shaking the bottle must be covered, as bright
daylight alters the result very markedly. The blood solution in the bottle is then

poured out into one of three narrow test-tubes of equal diameter. Into another
of these test-tubes 5 c.c. of the original solution of blood are measured out with a
pipette. The third is filled with the same blood solution after the hsemoglobin has
been completely converted into carboxyhremoglobin by shaking for about a minute

with coal gas.

     Carmine is now added from a burette to the 6 c.c. of oxyhferaoglobin until

first the tint of the solution from the bottle of air, and afterwards the tint of the

solution saturated with coal gas attained. Water may also be added if the car-
mine solution alters the depth of colour of the liquid. From the readings of the
burette the proportion of carboxyhicmoglobin to oxyha3moglobin may easily be
calculated. In practice the estimation may be 2 per cent, too low or too high,

but this is about the limit of error.

    When 0'09 per cent, of carbonic oxide is present in the air the hcemoglobin is

shared equally between the oxygen and carbonic oxide. Tiie affinity of carbonic
oxide for haemoglobin is thus about 230 times as great as that of oxygen when

twice 0'09 or 018 per cent, of carbonic oxide is present; two-tbirds of the hajmo-

globin go to the carbon oxide and one-third to the oxygen, and so on. Roughly
speaking, the percentage of carbonic oxide in the air can be calculated by multi-
plying the number of parts of carboxyhremoglobin to one part of oxyh hemoglobin
by 0-09. Thus, if the hsemoglobin were found to be 10 per cent, saturated with
carbonic oxide, then, as there would be to each part of oxyhasmoglobin one-ninth
of carboxyhfemoglobin, one-ninth of 0'09 or 001 per cent, of carbonic oxide would

be present in the air.

     It is evident that the method cannot be used directly when high percentage.*
of carbonic oxide are present. The sample in such a case must be diluted. Coal
gas, for instance, requires dilution to about xJu'b with air when this method is

employed. When the oxygen percentage in the air is much diminished the sample

must also be largely diluted -with air, or a correction made in calculating the result.

    Blood solution was originally suggested by Vogel as a qualitative test for CO in
air. He used the spectroscopic test, and found he could detect 02 per cent, of the gas.

2. The Detection and Estimation of Carbon Monoxide in the Air hy the
             Flame-cap Test. By Professor Frank Clowes, D.Sc.

     The detection of carbon monoxide in the air is mainly of importance on account
of its poisonous nature when inhaled. It would rarely happen that serious ex-
plosions arise from its being fired in admixture with air, since a carbon monoxide
explosion is of a comparatively mild character, and further air only commences to
be feebly explosive when the carbon monoxide is present in the proportion of at
least 13 per cent. ; this is an amount which would render the air rapidly fatal to life.

    The introduction of carbon monoxide into the air may arise from leakage of
many forms of gaseous fuel, such as coal-gas, producer-gas, Dowson-g as, water-gas,

and flue-gas from smelting works, whether the metal is smelted by the old reducing

methods, or by the newer method more recently applied by Mr. Mond to the

smelting of nickel ores. This gas is also produced by the detonation of the nitro-

cotton explosives, and by the imperfect combustion of any ordinary fuel whicli may

occur either slowly or explosively. Hence cases of poisoning by this gas have
mainly arisen from the ' gas ' taken from the iron blast-furnace, from water-gas
either used alone or in the enrichment of coal-gas, from coal-gas leakage, and from

the ' after-damp ' of the colliery explosion or ' gob-fire.' It will be seen that this

insidious poison is, therefore, of not infrequent occurrence in the air. The author
finds that 0-25 per cent, of the gas can be detected in the air by a ' cap ' O'.") inch
in height over the standard hydrogen flame. This test is, therefore, sufficiently
sensitive for practical application, and furnishes the most rapid means of detecting

the gas. It fuvt!ier serves to measure the percentage of carbon monoxide present

in the air, since the height of the cap regularly increases as the amount of gas

increases. It is applied either by carrying an ordinary miner's safety-lamp provided

with a hydrogen flame into the atmosphere to be tested                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   or, since this would

jn-obably be attended with danger from carbon monoxide, the atmosphere can be

made to pass over the flame by means of a pump. This test, however, fails to

'distinguish carbonic oxide from other combustible gases, and therefore recourse
must be had to the ordinary process of absorption with cuprous chloride solution

when the distinction, as well as the estimation of this gas, is necessary. The

cuprous chloride method does not readily measure less than 5 per. cent, of the

gas in the air, and this is a seriously poisonous proportion.

Dr. Haldane's method of detection and estimation, by means of suitably diluted

blood, possesses the advantage of being delicate and distinctive, but requires good

daylight, and cannot be carried out so rapidly as the flame-cap teat can. It is,
iiowever, undoubtedly the most satisfactory metliod yet known of detecting and

estimating minute proportions of carbon monoxide in the air, and should take its
jplace amongst acknowledged methods in the chemical laboratory.

not commenced low enough down in the school. Botany, though so generally

adopted, has a very limited  educative value                                                              physiology, though                                                                                                                                                                                                             called  &    science,

i.s scarcely ever taught as a science at all ; and domestic economy is quite

pernicious. Physical geography has an educative function of its own, but, though

of immense value, its strength does not lie in the direction of scientific training-.

"What is wanted to obtain this pre-eminently important effect is a gently graduated

scientific course beginning with the simplest experiments for quite young

children, and gradually increasing in complexity till the girls reach the age of

about sixteen. It should be recognised that from beginning to end the course

should be practical in character and quantitative as far as possible. Such a course

as this can be followed if practical arithmetic be made the starting-point. This

leads naturally to elementary physics, chiefly hydrostatics, and finally to a course

of elementary chemistry. For this latter no finer scheme could be suggested than

that outlined in Dr. Armstrong's contribution to the Report of the British

Association Committee (Newcastle-on-Tyne meeting, 1889), which is of inesti-

mable value to all who are interested in the teaching of chemistry. It is an

important feature of the course I suggest that the children should use no text-

l)ooks ; their own notes written in their own words should form their books of

reference. In this way their literary powers are also cultivated ; but, above all,

the children learn to rely on themselves. The aim of science training is to teach

the girls to think for themselves, rely on themselves, and work for themselves.

They must learn to do something, and this will never happen while science work

is confined to mere lesson learning.

   --President of the Section J. E. Mare, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Sec. G.S.

                          THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17,

   The President delivered the following Address :--

The feelings of one who, heing but little versed in the economic applications of

his science, is called upon to address a meeting of the Association held in a large in-
dustrial centre might, under ordinary circumstances, he of no very pleasant character;

but I take courage when I remember that those connected with my native county,
in which we are now gathered, have taken prominent part in advancing

branches of our science which are not directly concerned with industrial affairs.

I am reminded, for instance, that one amongst you, himself a busy professional

man, has in his book on ' The Origin of Mountain Ranges ' given to the world a
theoretical work of the highest value ; that, on the opposite side of the county,

those who are responsible for the formation and management of that excellent

educational institution, the Ancoats Museum, have wisely recognised the value of
some knowledge of geology as a means of quickening our appreciation of the

beauties of Nature ; and that one who has done solid service to geology by his
teachings, who has kept before us the relationship of our science to that which is

-- --beautiful I refer to the distinguished author of 'Modern Painters' has chosen

the northern part of the county for his home, and has illustrated his teaching-
afresh by reference to the rocks of the lovely district around him. Nor can I help

--referring to one who has recently passed away the late Sir Joseph Prestwich

the last link between the pioneers of our science and the geologists of the present

day, who, though born in London, was of Lancashire family, and whom we may
surely therefore claim as one of Lancashire's worthies. With these evidences of

 the catholicity of taste on the part of geologists connected with the county, I feel

free to choose my own subject for this address, and, my time being occupied to a

large extent with academic work, I may be pardoned for treating that subject in
 academic fashion. As I have paid considerable attention to the branch of the
 science which bears the somewhat uncouth designation of stratigraphical geology^

I propose to take the present state of our knowledge of this branch as my theme.
     Of the four great divisions of geology, petrology may be claimed as being-

 largely of German origin, the great impetus to its study having been given by
 Werner and his teachings. Palaeontology may be as justly claimed by the French
 nation, Cuvier having been to so great an extent responsible for placing it upon
a scientific basis. Physical geology we may partly regard as our own, the principles
 laid down bv Hutton and supported by Playfair having received illustration from

a host of British writers, amongst whom may be mentioned Jukes, Ramsay, and
TRANSACTIOISS OF SECTION C.                 763

the brothers Geikie ; but the grand principles of physical geology have been 8o

largely illustrated by the magnificent aod simple features displayed on the otlier

side of the Atlantic that we may well refer to our American brethren as leaders in

this branch of study. The fourth branch, stratigraphical geology, is essentially

British as regards origin, and, as everyone is aware, its scientific principles were

established by William Smith, who was not only the father of English geology,

but of stratigraphical geology in general.

Few win deny that stratigraphical geology is the highest branch of the science,

for, as has been well said, it ' gathers up the sum of all that is made known by the

other departments of the science, and makes it subservient to the interpretation of

the geological history of the earth.' The object of the stratigraphical geologist is

to obtain information concerning all physical, climatic, and biological events which

have occurred during each period of the past, and to arrange them in chronological

order, so as to write a connected history of the earth. If all of this information

were at our disposal, we could write a complete earth-history, and the task of the
geologist would be ended. As it is, we have barely crossed the threshold of

discovery, and the ' imperfection of the geological record,' like the 'glorious un-

certainty ' of our national game, gives geology one of its great charms. Before

passing on to consider more particularly the present state of the subject of our

study, a few remarks upon this imperfection of the geological record may not be
out of place, seeing that the term has been used by so many modern writers, and

its exact signification occasionally misunderstood. The imperfection of the
palaeontological record is usually understood by the term when used, and it will be

considered here as an illustration of the incompleteness of our knowledge of earth-

history ; but it must be remembered that the imperfection of the physical record is
equally striking, as will be insisted on more fully in the sequel.

Specially prominent amongst the points upon which we are ignorant stands the

nature of the Precambrian faunas. The extraordinary complexity of the earliest

known Cambrian fauna has long been a matter for surprise, and the recent dis-

coveries in connection with the Olenelhis fauna do not diminish the feelino-.*

After commenting upon the varied nature of the earliest known fauna, the late

Professor Huxley, in his Address to the Geological Society in 1862, stated that

'any admissible hypothesis of progressive modification must be compatible with

persistence without progression, through indefinite periods. . , . Should such an

hypothesis eventually be proved to be true, . . . the conclusion will inevitably

present itself, that the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and Cainozoic faunte and florae, taken

together, bear somewhat the same proportion to the whole series of living beings

which have occupied this globe, as the existing fauna and flora do to them.'

Whether or not this estimate is correct, all geologists will agree that a vast period

of time must have elapsed before the Cambrian period, and yet our ignorance of
faunas existing pi-ior to the time when the Olenellus fauna occupied the Cambrian

seas is almost complete. True, many pre-Oambrian fossils have been described at
various times, but, in the opinion of many competent judges, the organic nature of

each one of these requires confirmation. I need not, however, enlarge upon this

matter, for 1 am glad to say we have amongst us a geologist who will at a later

stage read a paper before this Section upon the subject of pre-Cambrian fossils, and

there is no one better able, owing to his intimate acquaintance with the actual

relics, to present fairly and impartially the arguments which have been advanced

in favour of the organic origin of the objects which have been appealed to as

evidences of organisms of pre-Cambrian age than our revered co-worker from
WeCanada, Sir J. William Dawson.
                                  may look forward with confidence to the

future discovery of many faunas older than those of which we now possess certain

    ' Dr. C. D. Walcott, in his monograph on ' The Fauna of the Lower Cambrian or

--Olenellus Zone ' (Washington, 1890), records the following great groups as represented

in the Olenellus beds of America: Sponyiae, Hydrozoa, Actinozna, Echinodermata,
Annelida 1 (trails, burrows, and tracks), Brachiopoda, Lamellibrancliiata, Gasteropoda,

Pteropoda, Crustacea, and Trilobita. Others are known as occurring in beds of the

knowledge, Lut until these are discovered the palfoontological record must be
admitted to be in a remarkably incomplete condition. In the meantime a study
of the recent advance of our knowledg-e of early life is significant of the mode in
which still earlier faunas will probably be brought to light. In 1845 Dr. E.

Emmons described a fossil, now known to be an Olenellus, though at that time the
earliest fauna was supposed to be one containing a much later group of organisms,

and it was not until Nathorst and Brogger established the position of the Olenelhis
zone that the existence of a fauna earlier than that of which Paradoxides was a
member was admitted ; and, indeed, the Tarado.vides fauna itself was proved to be
earlier than that containing Olefins, long after these two genera had been made
familiar to palaeontologists, the Swedish palreontologist, Augelin, having referred
the Faro'loxides fauna to a period earlier than that of the one with Ohnus. It is
quite possible, therefore, that fossils are actually preserved in our museums at the
present moment which have been extracted from rocks deposited before the period
of formation of the Oleyiellus beds, though their age has not been determined. The
Olenelhii horizon now furnishes us with a datum-line from which we can work
backwards, and it is quite possible that the Keobo/i/s beds of the Salt Eange,"^
which underlie beds holding 0/e«e//M.s, really do contain, as has been maintained, a

fauna of date anterior to the formation of the Olencllns beds; and the same may

be the case with the beds containing the Proto/evi'>< fauna in Canada," for this

fauna i.^ very different from anj- known in the OIene//irs beds, or at a higher

horizon, though Mr. G. F. Matthew, to whom geologists owe a great debt for his

admirable descriptions of the early fossils of the Canadian rocks, speaks very
cautiously of the age of the beds containing Piotolenus and its associates. Not-
withstanding our ignorance of pre-Cambrian faunas, valuable work has recently
been done in proving the existence of important groups of stratified rocks deposited

previously to the formation of the beds containing the earliest known Cambrian
fossils ; I may refer especially to the proofs of the pre-Cambrian age of the
Torridon sandstone of North-west Scotland, lately furnished by the officers of the
Geological Survey, and their discovery that the maximum thickness of these
strata is over 10,000 feet.^ Amongst the sediments of this important system,
more than one fauna may be discovered, even if most of the strata were accu-
mulated with rapidity, and all geologists must hope that the officers of the Survey
who, following Nicol, Lapworth, and others, have done so much to elucidate the

--geological structure of the Scottish Highlands may obtain the legitimate reward

of their labours, and definitely prove the occurrence of rich faunas of pre-Cambrian

age in the rocks of that region.

    But, although we may look forward hopefully to the time when we may lessen

the imperfection of the records of early life upon the globe, even the most hopeful
cannot expect that record to be rendered perfect, or that it will make any near
approach to perfection. The posterior segments of the remarkable trilobite

Mesonnci^ rermontaiia are of a much more delicate character than the anterior

ones, and the resemblance of the spine on the fifteenth ' body-segment ' of this
species to the terminal spine of Olenel/us proper suggests that in the latter sub-

genus posterior segments of a purely membranous character may have existed,

devoid of hard parts. If this be so, the entire outer covering of the trilobites, at a

period not very remote from the end of pre-Cambrian times, may have been mem-
branous, and the same thing may have occurred with the structures analogous to

the hard parts of organisms of other groups. Indeed, with our present views as

to development, we can scarcely suppose that organisms acquired hard parts at a
very early period of their existence, and fauna after fauna may have occupied the
globe, and disappeared, leaving no trace of its existence, in which case we are not

likely ever to obtain definite knowledge of the characters of our earliest faunas,

and the biologist must not look to the geologist for direct information concerning

the dawn of life upon the earth.

    Proceeding now to a consideration of the faunas of the rocks formed after

pre-Cambrian times, a rough test of the imperfection of the record may_be made by

examining the gaps which occur in the vertical distribution of forms" of life. If

our knowledge of ancient faunas were very incomplete, we ought to meet with
many cases of recurrence of forms after their apparent disappearance from inter-

vening strata of considerable thickness, and many such cases have actually been

described by that eminent palaeontologist, M. J5arrande, amongst the Palaeozoic

rocks of Bohemia, though even these are gradually being reduced in number owing

to  recent  discoveries                                             indeed,  in.  the  case  of the  marine faunas, marked cases of
                                                                 ;

recurrence are comparatively rare, and the occui-rence of each form is generally

fairly unbroken from its first appearance to its final extinction, thus showing that

the imperfection of the record is by no means so marked as might be supposed.

Freshwater and terrestrial forms naturally furnish a large percentage of cases of

recurrence, owing to the comparative rarity with which deposits containing such

organisms are preserved aiuonust the strata.

   A brief consideration of the main reasons for the present imperfection of our

knowledge of the faunas of rocks formed subsequently to pre-Cambrian rimes may

be useful, and suggestive of lines along which future work may be carried out.

That detailed work in tracts of country which are yet unexplored, or have been but

imperfectly examined by the geologist, will add largely to our stock of information

needs only to be mentioned; the probable importance of work of this kind in the

future may be inferred from a consideration of the great increase of our know-

ledge of tlie Permo-Carboniferous faunas, as the result of recent labours in remote

regions. It is specially desirable that the ancient faunas and floras of tropical re-

gions should be more fully made known, as a study of these will probably throw

considerable light upon the influence of climate upon the geographical distribution

of organisms in past times. The old floras and faunas of Arctic regions are

becoming fairly well known, thanks to the zeal with which the Arctic regions have

been explored. But, confining our attention to the geology of our own country,
much remains to be done even hei-e, and local observers especially have opportuni-

ties of adding largely to our stock of knowledge, a task they have performed so

well in the past. To give examples of the value of such work, our knowledge of

the fauna of the Cambrian rocks of Britain is largely due to the present President

of the Geological Society, when resident at St. David's ; whilst the magnificent

fauna of the Wenlock limestone would have been far less perfectly known than

it is, if it were not for the collections of men like the late Colonel Fletcher and

the late Dr. Grindrod. Again, the existence of the rich fauna of the Cambridge

Greensand would have been unsuspected, had not the bed known by that name

been worked for the phosphatic nodules which it contains.

    It is very desirable that large collections of varieties of species should be made,

for in this matter the record is very imperfect. There has been, and, I fear, is still,

a tendency to reject specimens when their characters do not conform with those given

in specific descriptions, and thus much valuable material is lost. Local observers

should be specially careful to search for varieties, which may be very abundant in

places where the conditions were favourable for their production, though rare or

unknown elsewhere. Thus, I find the late Mr. W. Keeping remarking that ' it is

noteworthy that at Upware, and indeed all other places known to me, the species

of Brachiopoda [of the Iseocomlan beds] maintain much more distinctness and
isolation from one another than at Brickhill.' > The latter place appears to be one
where conditions were exceptionally favourable in Neocomian times for the pro-

duction of intermediate forms.

   A mere knowledge of varieties is, however, of no great use to the collector

without a general acquaintance with the morphology of the organisms whose

remains he extracts from the earth's strata, and one who has this can do signal

service to tlie science. It is specially important that local observers should be
willing to devote themselves to the study of particular groups of organisms, and

to collect large suites of specimens of the group they have chosen for study. With
a group like the graptolites, for instance, the specimens which are apparently best

preserved are often of little value from a morphological point of view, and frag-
ments frequently furnish more information than more complete specimens. These

fragments seldom find their way to our museums, and accordingly we may examine
a large suite of graptolites in those museums without finding any examples showing
particular structures of importance, such as the sac-like bodies carried by many of
these creatures. As an illustration of the value of work done by one who has
made a special study of a particular group of organisms, I may refer to the
remarkable success achieved by the late Mr. Norman Glass in developing the

calcareous supports of the brachial processes of Brachiopods. AVork of this cha-

racter will greatly reduce the imperfection of the record from the biologist's point

of view.

     The importance of detailed work leads one to comment upon the general
methods of research which have been largely adopted in the case of the stratified
rocks. The principle that strata are ideniitiable by their included organisms is the
basis of modern work, as it was of that which was achieved by the father of
English Geology, and the identification of strata in this manner has of recent
years been carried out in very great detail, notwithstanding the attempt on the
part of some well-known writers to show that correlation of strata in great detail
is impossible. The objection to this detailed work is mainly founded upon the
fact that it must take time for an organism or group of organisms to migrate from
one area to another, and therefore it was stated that they cannot have lived con-
temporaneously in two remote areas. But the force of this objection is practically
done away with if it can be shown that the time taken for migration is exceedingly
short as compared with the time of duration of an organism or group of organisms

--upon the earth, and this has been shown in the oidy possible way namely, by

accumulating a very great amount of evidence as the result of observation. The
eminent writers relerred to above, who were not trniued geologists, never properly
grasped the vast periods of time which must have elapsed during the occurrence of

the events which it is the geologist's province to study. An historian would speak

of events which began at noon on a certain day and ended at midnight at the
close of that day as contemporaneous with events which commenced and ended
five minutes later, and this is quite on a par with what the geologist does when

correlating strata. Nevertheless, there are many people who still view the

task of correlating minute subdivisions of stratified systems with one another
with a certain amount of suspicion, if not with positive antipathy ; but the
work must be done for all that. Brilliant generalisations are attractive as

well as valuable, but the steady accumulation of facts is as necessary for the

advancement of the science as it was in the days when the Geological Society
was founded, and its members applied themselves * to multiply and record
 observations, and patiently to await the result at some future period.' I have
already suggested a resemblance between geology and cricket, and I may be per-
mitted to point out that just as in the game the free-hitter wins the applause,
though the patient ' stone-waller ' often wins the match, so, in the science, the man

apt at brilliant generalisations gains the approval of the general public, but the
patient recorder of apparently insignificant details adds matter of permanent value

to the stores of our knowledge. In the case of stratigraphical geology, if we

were compelled to be content with correlation of systems only, and were unable to
ascertain which of the smaller series and stages were contemporaneous, but could

only speak of these as ' homotaxial,' we should be in much the same position as
the would-be antiquary who was content to consider objects fashioned by the
Romans as contemporaneous with those of mediaeval times. Under such circum-
stances geology would indeed be an uncertain science, and we should labour in the

field, knowing that a satisfactory earth-history would never be written. Let us

hope that a brighter future is in store for us, and let me urge my countrymen to

continue to study the minute subdivisions of the strata, lest they be left behind by
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                           767

the geologists of other countries, to -whom the necessity for this kind of study ia

apparent, and who are carrying it on with great success.

The value of detailed work on the part of the stratigraphical geologist is best

grasped if we consider the recent advance that has been made in our science owing

to the more or less exhaustive survey of the strata of various areas, and the appli-

Acation of the results obtained to the elucidation of earth's history.                      review of

this nature will enable us not only to see what has been done, but also to detect

lines  of inquiry which it will be useful to pursue  in  the  future                        but it is obvious
                                                                                         ;

that the subject is so wide that little more cau be attempted than to touch lightly

Aupon some of the more prominent questions.              work might well be written

Wetreating of the matters which I propose to notice.          have all read our ' Prin-

ciples of Geology,' or ' The Modern Changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants

considered as illustrative of Geology,' to quote the alternative title ; some day we
may have a book written about the ancient changes of the earth and its inhabitants

considered as illustrative of geography.

Commencing with a glance at the light thrown on inorganic changes by a

detailed examination of the strata, I may briefly allude to advances which have

recently been made in the study of denudation. The minor faults, which can only

be detected when the small subdivisions of rock-groups are followed out carefully

on the ground, have been shown to lie of great importance in defining the direction

in which the agents of denudation have operated, as demonstrated by Professor

W. C. Brogger, for instance, in the case of the Christiania Fjord ; ^ and I have

recently endeavoured to prove that certain valleys in the English Lake District

have been determined by shattered belts of country, the existence of which is

shown by following thin bands of strata along their outcrop. The importance of

the study of the strata in connection with the genesis and subsequent changes of

river-systems is admirably brought out in Professor W. M. Davis's paper on 'The

Development of certain English Rivers,- a paper which should be read by all

physical geologists ; it is, indeed, a starting-point for kindred work which remains

especially for local observers to accomplish. Study of this kind not only adds to

our knowledge of the work of geological agencies, but helps to diminish the im-

perfection of the record, for the nature of river-systems, when rightly understood,

enables us to detect the former presence of deposits over areas from which they

have long since been removed by denudation.

    An intimate acquaintance with the lithological characters of the strata of a

district affords valuable information in connection with the subject of glacial

denudation. The direction of glacial transport over the British Isles has been

largely inferred from a study of the distribution of boulders of igneous rock, whilst

those of sedimentary rock have been less carefully observed. The importance of

the latter is well shown by the work which has been done in Northern Europe in

tracing the Scandinavian boulders to their sources, a task which could not have

been performed successfully if the Scandinavian strata had not been studied in

great detail.* I shall presently have more to say with regard to work connected

with the lithological characters of the sediments. Whilst mentioning glacial

denudation, let me allude to a piece of work which should be done in great detail,

though it is not, strictly speaking, connected wiih stratigraphy, namely, the

mapping of the rocks around asserted ' rock-basins.' I can find no actual proof

of the occurrence of such basins in Britain, and it is very desh-able that the solid

rocks and the drift should be carefully inserted on large-scale maps, not only all

around the shores of several Jakes, but also between the lakes and the sea, in order

to ascertain whether the lakes are really held in rock-basins. Until this work

changed the direction of advance of geology in this country owing to his lesearcheo
' On the Microscopical Structure of Crystals, indicating the Origin of ^Minerals and.
Kocks.' I refer, of course, to Dr. il. C. Sorby. But since our attention has been

so largely directed to petrology, the study of the igneous and metamorphic rocka
has been most zealously pursued, whilst that of the sediments has been singularly
little heeded, with few exceptions, prominent amongst which is the work of
Mr. Maynard Hatchings, the results of which have been recently published in tho

* Geological Magazine.' though we must all hope that the details which havo
hitherto been supplied to us, valuable as they are, are only a foretaste of what ia

to follow from the pen of this able observer. Descriptions of the lithological
changes which occur in a vertical series of sediments, as well as of tliose which are

observed when any particular band is traced laterally, will no doubt throw ligh^

upon a number of interesting questions.
      Careful work amongst the ancient sediments, especially those which are of

organic origin, has strikingly illustrated the general identity of characters, and
therefore of methods of formation, of deposits laid down on the sea-iioors of past
 times and those which are at present in course of construction. Globigerine-oozes

 have been detected at various horizons and in many countries. Professor H.

 Alleyne Nichol.son ' has described a pteropod-ooze of Devonian age in the Hamilton
 Limestone of Canada, which is largely composed of the tests of Sft/liola; and to

 Dr. G. J. Hinde we owe the discovery of a large number of radiolarian cherts of
 Palaeozoic and Neozoic ages in various parts of the globe. The extreme thinness
 of many argillaceous deposits, which are represented elsewhere by hundreds of feet
 of strata, suggests that >ome of them, at any rate, may be analogous to the deep-
 sea clays of modern oceans, though in the case of deposits of this nature we mus%_
 depend to a large extent upon negative evidence. The uniformity of character of

 thin marine deposits over wide areas is in itself evidence of their formation a,t
 some distance Irom the land ; but although the proofs of origin of ancient sedi-

 ments far from coast-lir.es may be looked upon as permanently established, the

 evidence for their deposition at great depths below tiie ocean's surface might be
 advantageously increased in the ciise of many of them. The fairly modern sedi-
 ments, containing genera which are still in existence, are more likely to furnish
 satisfactory proofs of a deep-sea origin than are more ancient deposits. Thus the

 mexistence of Archaopnemtes and CysitchhuiS the oceanic series of Barbadoes, as

 described by Dr. J. G. Gregory, furnishes strong proofs of the deep-sea character
 of the deposits, whilst the only actual argument in favour of the deep-sea character

 of certain Pakeozoic sediments has been put forward by Professor Suess, who notes

 the similarity of certain structures of creatures ui ancient rocks t'> those possessed

 by modern deep-sea Crustacea, especially the co-existence of trilobites which are

 blind with those which have enormously developed eyes.

    A question which has been very prominently brought to the fore in recent

 years is that of the n;ode of formation of certain coral-reefs. The theory of
 Charles Darwin, lately so widely accepted as an explanation of the mode of
 formation of barrier-reefs and atolls, has been, as is well known, criticised by
 Dr. Murray, with the result that a large number of valuable observations have
 been recently made ou modern reefs, especially by biologists, as a contribution to
 the study of reef formation. Nor have geologists been inactive. Dr. E. Mojsisovics
 and Professor Dupont, to mention two prominent observers, have described knoll-
 like masses of limestone more cr less analogous, as regards structure, to modern
 coral-reefs. They consider that these have been formed by corals, and indeed
 Dupont maintains that the atoll-shape is still recognisable in ancient Devonian

                    ' Nicholson and Lydekker, JI/(7?iKfJ ^y'Pa^fWM^r'Zfl^y, chap. iL
TRANSACTIOXS OF SECTION C.  769

coral-reefs in Belgium.' I would obserA-e that all cases of ' liuoll-reefs ' of this
character have been described in districts which furnish proofs of having been

subjected to considerable erogenic disturbance, subsequent to the formation of the
rocks composing the knoll-shaped masses, whilst in areas which have not been

affected by violent earth-foldings, the reef-building corals, so far as I have been
able to ascertain, give rise to sheet-like masses, such as should be produced accord-
ing to Dr. Murray's theory. I would mention especially the reefs of the Corallian
Rocks of England, and also some admirable examples seen amongst the Carbo-
niferous Limestone strata of the great western escarpment of the Pennine Chain
which faces the Eden "S'alley in the neighbourhood of Melmerby in Cumberland.
Considering the number of dissected coral-reefs which exist amongst the strata of
the earth's crust, and the striking way in which their structure is often displayed,
it is rather i-eniarkable that comparatively little attention has been paid to them
by geologists in general, when the subject has been so prominently brought before
the scientific world, for we must surely admit that we are much more likely to gain
important information, shedding light upon the methods of reef-formation, by a
study of such dissected reefs, than by making a few bore-holes on some special
coral island. I would specially recommend geologists to make a detailed study ci'
the British coral-reefs of Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Jurassic ages.

    Turning now to organic deposits of vegetable origin, we must, as the result of

detailed work, be prepared to admit the inapplicability of any one theory of the

formation of coal seams. The ' growth-in-place ' theory may be considered fairly

well established for some coals, such as the spore-coals, whilst the ' drift ' theory
furnishes an equally satisfactory explanation of the formation of cannel-coal.

It is now clear that the application of the general term coal to a number of

materials of diverse nature, and probably of diverse origin, was largely responsible
for the dragging-out of a controversy, in which the champions of either sid«
endeavoured to explain the origin of all coal in one particular way.

     The stratigraphical geologist, attempting to restore the physical geography of
former periods, naturally pays much attention to the positions of ancient coast-
lines ; indeed, all teachers find it impossible to give an intelligible account of th«
stratified rocks without some reference to the distribution of land and sea at the
time of their formation. The general position of land-masses at various times has
been ascertained in several parts of the world, but much more information must be
gathered together before our restorations of ancient sea-margins approximate to
the truth. The Carboniferous rocks of Britain have been specially studied with
reference to the distribution of land and water during the period of their accumu-
lation, and yet we find that owing to the erroneous identitication of certain rocks
of Devonshire as grits or sandstones, which Dr. Ilinue has shown to be radiolarian
cherts, land was supposed to lie at no great distance south of this region in Lower
Carbonifei'ous times, whereas the probabilities are in favour of the existence of an
open ocean at a considerable distance from any land in that direction. This case
furnishes us with an excellent warning against generalisation upon insufficient

data.

    As a result of detailed study of the strata, the effects of earth-movements
have been largely made known to us, especially of those comparatively

local disturbances spoken of as orogenic, which are mainly connected with
mountain-building, whilst information concerning the more widely spread
epeirogenic movements is also furnished by a study of the stratified rocks. The

structure of the Alps, of the North-West Highlands of Scotland, and of the
uplifted tracts of North America is now familiar to geologists, whilst the study
of comparatively recent sediments has proved the existence of widespread and
extensive movements in times which are geologically modern; for instance, the

deep-water deposits of late Tertiary age found in the AVest Indies indicate

the occurrence of considerable uplilt in that region. But a great amount of

     ' Similar knoU-Iike masses have been described in this country by Mr. R. E.
Tiddeman as occurring in the Craven district of Yorkshire, but he does not attribute
their formation to coral-growth to any great extent.
770 REPORT--1896.

work yet remains to be done in this connection, especially concerning horizontal

distortion of masses of the earth's crust, owing to more rapid horizontal advance

of one portion than of another, during periods of movement. Not until we gather

together a large amount of information derived from actual inspection of the rocks

shall we be able to frame satisfactory theories of earth-movement, and in

the meantime we are largely dependent upon the speculations of the physicist,

often founded upon very imperfect data, on which is built an imposing super-

Westructure of mathematical reasoning.                                 have been told that our continents and

ocean-basins have been to a great extent permanent as regards position through

long geological ages ; we now reply by pointing to deep-sea sediments of nearly

all geological periods, which have been uplitted from the ocean-abysses to form

portions of  our  continents                                           and as the result of study of the distribution of fossil
                                                                    ;

organisms, we can point almost as confidently to the sites of old continents now

sunk down into the ocean depths. It seems clear that our knowledge of the causes
of earth-movements is still in its infancy, and that we must be content to wait

awhile, until we have further information at our disposal.
     Recent work has proved the intimate connection betwixt earth-movement and

the emission and intrusion of igneous rocks, and the study of igneous rocks has

advanced beyond the petrographical stage ; the rocks are now made to contribute

their share towards the history of ditferent geological periods. The part which

volcanic action has played in the actual formation of the earth's crust is well

exemplified in Sir Archibald Geikie's Presidential Addresses to the Geological

Society, wherein he treats of the former volcanic history of the British Isles.^ The

way in which extruded material contributes to the formation of sedimentary
masses has, perhaps, not been fully grasped by many writers, who frequently seem

to assume that deposition is a measure of denudation, and vice versa, whereas
deposition is only a measure of denudation, and of the material which has been

ejected in a fragmental condition from the earth's interior, which in some places

forms a very considerable percentage of the total amount of sediment.

     The intruded rocks also throw much light on past earth-history, and I cannot
give a better illustration of the valuable information which they may furnish to

the stratigraphical geologist, when rightly studied, than by referring to the

excellent and suggestive work by my colleague, Mr. Alfred Harker, on the Bala

A'^olcanic Rocks of Carnarvonshire.-

Perhaps the most striking instance of the effect which detailed stratigraphical

work has produced on geological thought is supplied by the study of the crystal-

line schists. Our knowledge of the great bulk of the rocks which enter into the

formation of a schistose complex is not very great, but the mode of production of

many of them is now well known, and tlie crude speculations of some of the early

geologists are now making way for theories founded on careful and minute obser-

vations in the field as well as in the laboratory. Recent work amongst the crystal-

line schists shows, furthermore, how careful we should be not to assume that

because we have got at the truth, we have therefore ascertained the whole truth.

We all remember how potent a factor dynamic metamorphism was supposed to be,

owing to discoveries made in the greatly disturbed rocks of Scotland and Switzer-

land ; and the action of heat was almost ignored by some writers, except as a
minor factor, in the production of metamorphic change. The latest studies amongst

the foliated rocks tend to show that heat does play a most important part in the

manufactui'e ot schists. The detailed work of Mr. George Barrow, in North-east

Forfarshire,^ has already thrown a flood of light upon the origin of certain schists,

and their connection with igneous rocks, and geologists wall look forward with

eagerness to further studies of the puzzling Highland rocks by this keen observer.

The subject of former climatic conditions is one in which the geologist has

very largely depended upon followers of other branches of science for light, and

yet it is one peculiarly within the domain of the stratigraphical geologist ; and

information which has already heen furnished concerning former climatic condi-

tions, as the result of careful study of the strata, is probably only an earnest of
what is to follow when the specialist in climatology pays attention to the records

of the rocks, and avoids the theories elaborated in the student's sanctum. The
recognition of an Ice Age in Pleistocene times at once proved the fallacy of the

supposition that there has been a gradual fall in temperature throughout geological

ages without any subsequent rise, and accordingly most theories which have been

put forward to account for former climatic change have been advanced with special

reference to the Glacial period or periods, although there are many other interest-

ing matters connected with climate with which the geologist has to deal. Never-

theless, the occurrence of glacial periods is a matter of very great interest, and

one which has deservedly received much attention, though the extremely plausible

hypothesis of Croll, and the clear manner in which it has been presented to general

readers, tended to throw other views into the shade, until quite recently, when

this hypothesis has been controverted from the point of view of the physicist. In

the meantime considerable advance has been made in our actual knowledge, and

this year, probably for the first time, and as the result of the masterly resume of

Professor Edgworth David,' the bulk of British geologists are prepared to admit

that there has been more than one glacial period, and that the evidence of glacial

conditions in the southern hemisphere in Permo-Carboniferous times is esta-

blished. Croll's hypothesis of course requires the recurrence of glacial periods, but

leaving out of account arguments not of a geological character, which have been

advanced against this hypothesis, the objection raised by Messrs. Gray and

Kendall," that in the case of the Pleistocene Ice Age ' the cold conditions

came on with extreme slowness, the refrigerations being progressive from the
Eocene period to the climax,' seems to me to be a fatal one. At the same time,

rather than asking with the above writers ' the aid of astronomers and physicists

in the solution of ' this problem, I would direct the attention of stratigraphical

geologists to it, believing that, by steady accumulation of facts, they are more

likely than any one else to furnish^the true clue to the solution of the glacial

problem.

1 have elsewhere called attention to marked changes in the faunas of the

sedimentary rocks when passing from lower to higher levels, without the evidence

of any apparent physical break, or any apparent change in the physical conditions,

so I'ar as can be judged from the lithological characters of the strata, and have

suggested that such sudden faunistic variations may be due to climate. I refer to
the matter as one which may well occupy the attention of local observers.

One of the most interesting points connected with climatic conditions is

that of the former general lateral distribution of organisms, and its dependence

upon the distribution of climatic zones. The well-known work of the late
Dr. Neumayr ° has, in the opinion of many geologists, established the existence of

climatic zones whose boundaries ran practically parallel with the equator in

Jurassic and Cretaceous times, and the possible existence of similar climatic zones

in Palseozoic times has been elsewhere suggested ; but it is very desirable that

much more work should be done upon this subject, and it can only be carried out

by paying close attention to the vertical and lateral distribution of organisms in

the stratified rocks.

So lar we have chiefly considered the importance of stratigraphical geology

Wein connection with the inorganic side of nature.  now come to the bearing of

detailed stratigraphical work upon questions concerning the life of the globe, and

here the evidence furnished by the geologist particularly appeals to the general

educated public as well as to students of other sciences.

772 REPORT-- 1896.

Attention Las just been dii-ected to the probable importance of former

climatic changes in determining: the distribution of organisms, but the whole

subject of the geographical distribution of oi'ganisms during former geological

periods, though it has already received a considerable amount of attention, will

doubtless have much further light thrown upon it as the result of careful observations

carried out amongst the stratified rocks.

So long ago as 1853, Pictet laid it down as a palseontological law that ' the

geographical distribution of species found in the strata was more extended than

the range of species of existing faunas.' One would naturally expect that at a

time when the diversity of animal organisation was not so gi-eat as it now i:?,

the species, having fewer enemies with which to cope, and on the whole not too

complex organisations to be affected by outward circumstances, would spread

further laterally than they now do ; but as we know that in earliest Cambrian

times the diversity of organisation was very coDsiderable, it is doubtful whether

any appreciable difference would be exerted upon lateral distribution then and

now, owing to this cause. At the time at which Pictet wrote, the rich fauna of

the deeper parts of the oceans, with its many widely distributed forms of life,

was unknown, and the range in space of early organisms must have then struck

every one who thought upon the subject as being greater than that of the shallow-

water organisms of existing seas, which were alone known. It is by no means

clear, however, with our present knowledge, that Pictet's supposed law holds

good, and it will require a considerable amount of work before it can be

shown to be even apparently true. Our lists of the fossils of different

areas are not sufficiently complete to allow us to generalise with safety, but

a comparison of the faunas of Australia and Britain indicates a larger

percentage of forms common to the two areas, as we examine higher groups of

the geological column. If this indication be fully borne out by further work, it

will not prove the actual truth of the law, for the apparent wider distribution of

ancient forms of life might be due to the greater probability of elevation of

ancient deep-sea sediments than of more modern ones which have not been sub-

jected to so many elevatory movements. Still, if the law be apparently true, it is

a matter of some importance to geologists ; and I have touched upon the matter

here in order once again to emphasise the possibility of correlating comparatively

small thicknesses of strata in distant regions by their included organisms.

Mention of Pictet's laws, one of which states that fossil animals were con-

structed upon the same plan as existing ones, leads me to remark upon the

frequent assumption that certain fossils are closely related to living groups, when

the resemblances between the hard parts of the living and extinct forms are only

of the most general character. There is a natural tendency to compare a fossil

with its nearest living ally, but the comparison has probably been often pushed

too far, with the result that biologists have frequently been led to look for the

ancestors of one living group exclusively amongst forms of life which are closely

related to those of another living group. The result of detailed work is to bring

out more and more prominently the very important differences between some

ancient forms and any living creature, and to throw doubts on certain compari-

sons                     thus I find several of the  well-known fossils of the Old Red  Sandstone,
                      ;

formerly referred without hesitation to the fishes, are now doubtfully placed in

that class.

The importance of detailed observation in the field is becoming every day more

apparent, and the specialist who remains in his museum examining the collections

amassed by the labours of others, and never notes the mode of occurrence of

fossils in the strata, will perhaps soon be extinct, himself an illustration of the

principle of the survival of the fittest. In the first place such a worker can

never grasp the true significance of the changes wrought on fossil relics after they

have become entombed in the strata, especially amongst those rocks which have

been subjected to profound earth-movements ; and it is to be feared that many

/species 'are still retained iu our fossil lists, whose supposed specific characters

are due to distortion by pressure. But a point of greater importance is, that one

who confines his attention to museums cannot, unless the information supplied to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               '

him be very full, distinguish the ditlerences between fossils which are variations

from a contemporaneous dominant form, such as 'sports,' and those which have

been termed 'mutations,' which existed at a later period than the forms which

they resemble. The value of the latter to those who are attempting to work out

phylogenies is obvious, and their nature can only be determined as°the result of

very laborious and accurate field-work                                                                                                                                                                                  but  such  labour  in     such  a  cause is well

dangers which beset his path from an inspection of the various phylogenetic tree?

constructed mainly after study of existing beings only, so

'       .  .  like the borealis race,

That flit ere yon can point their place ;

but recent researches amongst various groups of fossil organisms have further

illustrated the danger of theorising upon insufficient data, especially suggestive

being the discovery of closely similar forms which were formerly considered to be

much more nearly related than now proves to be the case ; thus Dr. Mojsisovics *
lias shown that Ammonites once referred to the same species are specifically dis-

tinct, though their hard parts have acquired similar structures, sometimes con-

temporaneously, sometimes at different times, and Mr. S. S. Buckman - has observed
the same thing, which he speaks of as ' heterogenetic homceomorphy ' in the case
of certain brachiopods, whilst Prof. H. A. Nicholson and I ^ have given reasons for

supposing that such heterogenetic homceomorphy, in the case of the graptolites

Las sometimes caused the inclusion in one genus of forms which have arisen from'

TWO distinct genera. As the result of careful work, dangers of the nature here

suggested will be avoided, and our chances of indicating lines of descent correctly

will be much increased. It must be remembered that, however plausible the lines
of descent indicated by students of recent forms may be, the actual links in the
chains can only be discovered by examination of the rocks ; and it is greatly to be
desired that more of our geologists who have had a thorough training in the field

should receive in addition one as thorough in the zoological laboratory. Shall I

mybe forgiven if I venture on the opinion that a certain suspicion which some of

zoological fellow countrymen have of geological methods is due to their compara-
tive ignorance of palaeontology, and that it is as important for them to obtain
some knowledge of the principles of geology as it is for the stratigraphical

palaeontologist to study the soft parts of creatures whose relatives he finds in the

stratified rocks ?

The main lines along which the organisms of some of the larger "roups have

been developed have already been indicated by several pah-Bontofooists and
detailed work has been carried out in several cases. A s examples, let me allude

to the trilobites, of which a satisfactory natural classification was outlined by the

gi-eat Barrande in those volumes of his monumental work which deal with the

fossils of this order, whilst further indication of their natural inter-relationships

has been furnished by Messrs. 0. D. Walcott, tf. F. Matthew, and others- to the

graptolites, whose relationships have been largely worked out by Professor C.

Lapworth,/aa7e princeps amongst students of the Graptoliiokleu, to whom we

have been so ably treated by I»r. C. E. Beecher,"* laro'ely from a study of recent

forms, but also after careful study of those preserved in the fossil state                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          and to the

774 REPORT-- 1896.

I might give otlier instances,' but have chosen some striking ones, four of
which especially illustrate the great advances wliich are being made in the study
of the palaeontology of the invertebrates by our American brethren.

    I have occupied the main part of my address with reasons for the need of con-

ducting stratigraphical vfork with minute accuracy. Many of you may suppose

that the necessity for working in this way is so obvious that it is a work of
supererogation to insist upon it at great length ; but experience has taught me

that many geologists consider that close attention to details is apt to deter

workers from arriving at important generalisations in the present state of our

Ascience.       review of the past history of the science shows that William

Smith, and those who followed after him, obtained their most important

results by steady application to details, and subsequent generalisation, whilst

the work of those who theorise on insufficient data is apt to be of little

avail, though often demanding attention on account of its very daring, and

because of the power of some writers to place erroneous views in an attractive

light, just as

                '       .  .  the sun can fling
                     .

                Colours as bright on exhalations bred

                By weedy pool or pestilential swamp,

                As on the rivulet, sparkling where it runs,

                Or the pellucid lake.'

Nor is there any reason to suppose that it will be otherwise in the future ; and I

am not one of those who consider that the brilliant discoveries were the exclusive

reward of the pioneers in our science, and that labourers of the present day must
be contented with the gleanings of their harvest ; on the contrary, the discoveries
which await the geologist will probably be as striking as are those which he has
made in the past. The onward march of science is a rhythmic movement, with

now a period of steady labour, anon a more rapid advance in our knowledge. It
would perhaps be going too far to say that, so far as our science is concerned, we

are living in a period rather of the former than of the latter character, though no

great geological discovery bas recently affected human thought in the way in
which it was affected by the proofs of tbe antiquity of man, and by the publication
of ' The Origin of Species.' If, however, we are to some extent gathering materials,

rather than drawing far-reaching conclusions from them, I believe this is largely

due to the great expansion which our science has undergone in recent years. It

has been said that geology is ' not so much one science, as the application of all

the physical sciences to the examination and description of the structure of the

earth, the investigation of the agencies concerned in the production of that struc-
ture, and the history of their action ' ; and tbe application of other sciences to the

elucidation of the history of our globe has been so greatly extended of recent years

that we are apt to lose sight of the fact that geology is in itself a science, and that
it is the special province of the geologist to get his facts at first hand from exami-
nation of the earth. The spectroscope and the telescope tell the geologist much
but his pioper instrument is the hammer, and the motto of every geologist should
be that which has been adopted for the Geological Congress, ' Mente et malleo.''

    At the risk of being compared to a child playing with edged tools, I cannot

help referring to the bearing of modern stratigraplucal research on the suggested
replacement of a school of uniformitarianism by one of evolution. The distin-

guished advocate of evolutionism, who addressed the Geological Society in 1869

upon the modern schools of geological thought, spoke of the school of evolution as
though it were midway between those of uniformitarianism and catastrophism, as

    --' E.g., the following papers treating of the Cephalopoda : A. Hyatt, ' Genesis

indeed it is logically, though, considering the tenets of the upholders of catastro-

phism, as opposed to those of uniformitarianism, at the time of that address, there

is no doubt that evolutionism was rather a modification of the uniformitarianism

of the period than intermediate between it and catastrophism, which was then

mypractically extinct, at any rate in Britain. Oue of  predecessors in this chair,

speaking upon this subject, says that ' the good old British ship " Uniformity,"

built by Hutton and refitted by Lyell, has won so many glorious victories in the

past, and appears still to be in such excellent fighting trim, that I see no reason

why she should haul down her colours, either to " Catastrophe " or "Evolution."

It may be so ; but I doubt the expediency of nailing those colours to the mast.
That Lyell, in his great work, proved that the agents now in operation, working

with the same activity as that which they exhibit at the present day, might pro-

duce the phenomena exhibited by the stratified rocks seems to be generally

admitted, but that is not the same thing as proving that they did so produce them

Such proof can only be acquired by that detailed examination of the strata which

I have advocated in this address, and at the time that the last edition of the

' Principles ' appeared, our knowledge of the strata was far less complete than it

has subsequently become. It appears to me that we should keep our eyes open to

the possibility of many phenomena presented by rocks, even newer than the

Archaean rocks, having been produced under diiferent conditions from those now

prevalent. The depths and salinity of the oceans, the heights and extent of con-

tinents, the conditions of volcanic action, and many other things may have been

markedly different from what they are at present, and it is surely unphilosophical to

assume conditions to have been generally similar to those of the present day on

the slender data at our disposal. Lastly, uniformitarianism, in its strictest sense,

is opposed to rhythmic recurrence of events. ' Rhythm is the rule with nature

she abhors uniformity more than she does a vacuum,' wrote Professor Tyndall,

Whymany years ago, and the remark is worth noting by geologists.  have we no

undoubted signs of glacial epochs amongst the strata from early Cambrian times to

the Great Ice Period, except in Permo-Carboniferous times P Is there not an apparent

if not a real absence of manifestation of volcanic activity over wide areas of the

earth in Mesozoic times ? Were not Devonian, Permo-Triassic, and Miocene times

periods of mountain-building over exceptionally wide areas, whilst the intervening

Aperiods were rather marked by quiet depression and sedimentation ?  study of

the evidence available in connection with questions like these suggests rhythmic

recurrence. Without any desire to advocate hasty departure from our present

methods of research, I think it should be clearly recognised that evolution may

have been an important factor in changing the conditions even of those times of

which the geologist has more direct knowledge. In this, as in many other ques-

tions, it is best to preserve an open mind ; indeed, I think that geologists will do well
to rest satisfied without an explanation to many problems, amongst them the one

just referred to ; and that working hypotheses, though useful, are better retained in

the manuscript notebooks of the workers than published in the Transactions of

learned societies, whence they filter out into popular works, to the great delight

of a sceptical public should they happen to be overthrown.

    May I trespass upon your patience for one moment longer ? As a teacher
of geology, with many years' experience in and out of a large university, I have

come to the conclusion that geology is becoming more generally recognised as a
valuable instrument of education. The memory, the reasoning faculties, and the

powers of observation are alike quickened. The work in the open air, which i,=

inseparable from a right understanding of the science, keeps the body in healths
condition. But over and above these benefits, the communing with Nature, often

in her most impressive moods, and the insignificance of events in a man's lifetime,

as compared with the ceaseless changes through the long aeons which have gone

before, so influence man's moral nature that they drive out his meaner thoughts-
and make him 'live in charity with all men.'

"^ The following Papers were read :

                           On the Geology of the Isle of Man.
                By Professor "W. Boyd Dawkins, M.A., F.B.S.

     The geology of the Isle of Man presents many points worthy of the attention
of the Geological Section. The following notes are based on my survey, during
the last ten years, on the G-inch scale, and on borings carried out under my advice

through the thick covering of drift in the north of the island.

                                                The Ordovician Massif.

     The massif of the island consists of Ordovician clay-slates, phyllites, and
quartzites, locally much folded and contorted, traversed by numerous volcanic
dykes, and penetrated at Foxdale, the Dhoon, and Santon by three bosses of
granite. They are for the most part unfossiliferous, the only three fossils as yet
found being Pala'ochorda, Dicttionemn, and a trilobite,' sufficiently perfect to be
identified with one or other of the Ordovician genera. They are probably the
south-western prolongation of the Skiddaw slates of the Lake Country beneath
the Irish Sea. They are of unknown thickness, and have a general dip seawards,
from an axis running from N.E. to S.W., the slates and shales forming the

--central nucleus of hills Snaefel, Nortli and South Earule, Cronk-na-Trelay, &c.

and the quartzites for the most part occurring in the littoral areas, and more
particularly along the south-eastern seaboard, from Ramsey to Langnesa. These

rocks have been locally very much altered by the heat caused by crushing. Where

the slates, for example, have been traversed by white quartz veins, the friction,
caused by the smashing of the quartz into the softer slates, has caused the
development of mica-schist at the point of contact, and more rarely also of
hornblende.

     The crush-conglomerates (of Ballanayre and Sulby Glen), mainly occurring in
the north of the Massif, formed by the smashing of thinly bedded quartzites and
harder slates, and their being driven into the softer slates, testify to the enormous
subterranean forces>which have been at work, as Air. Lamplugh has conclusively
shown.- The result is a conglomerate, composed of blocks great and small, mostly
rounded, and some scored like those from the glacial drift, each being covered by

a thin film of sericite.

                                 llie Carboniferous Limestone of the South.

     The Carboniferous Limestone series is seen in the south of the island, in the
area of Castletown, Langness, and Ballasalla, to rest on a sea-worn floor of the
highly contorted Ordovician rocks. At the base is the Red Conglomerate, some
15 feet thick, out of which the arches at Langness have been cut by the sea.
It is formed of pebbles, red and white vein-quartz and red quartzite, derived
from the break-up of the strata below, the grey Ordovician quartzite, with iron
pyrites, having been oxidised into the red quartzite of the pebble. On this rest
the thinly bedded limestones and shales of Castletown Bay and Derbyhaven. The
beds of limestone increase in thickness to the west of Castletown Bay and at Port .
St. Mary. To the upper portion of this series belong the black and white lime-
stones and black Poseidonia shales of Pool Vaish, and the interbedded volcanic
agglomerate, between that place and Scarlet Point. The latter is proved to have
been the site of the eruption by the Augite Porphyrite of the Stack.

     The dykes of Olivine-dolerite ' which riddle the limestone on the shore between
this point and Castletown and Kentraugh are post -Carboniferous, and are referred

by Home and A. Geikie to the Early Tertiary age. The most important of these

is the Strandhall dyke, which cuts the lode in the Ballacorkish lead-mine, the fore-

shore at Straudhall, and then runs across the peninsula of Scai'Iet, appearing again

(la the foreshore at Knock-Rushsn. It is probably continued through the Bay of
(Castletown, and is represented by the network of dykes on the foreshore close to
the Langness copper-mine, and crossing the peninsula of Langness.

     The Carboniferous Limestone is highly faulted and folded, has a westerly dip,
and has been faulted down into the Ordovician strata by the Port St. Mary fault,
extending from the sea near that place, across Bay ny Carrickey to Ballashimmin,
the throw being to the east. In consequence of this the upper strata of the Car-

boniferous Limestone are unrepresented in the south of the island.

          The Fermian Strata of the North of the Island.

The series of Red Sandstones and Conglomerates, to the east of Peel, con-

sidered by some geologists to belong to the Old lied Sandstone, and by others to

the basement beds of the Carboniferous, are of Permian age. Tliey extend

along the shore-line from the Cregmalin to Willstrand, being faulted at both these

points against the Ordovician slates. Inland their boundary is concealed by the

thick covering of drift. It probably does not extend further than about one hun-

dred yards to the south of the main road from Peel to Kirk Michael, a boring at

Ballagar having proved the slate. It consists of, A, the Peel Sandstones, and

irregular conglomerates, red, and reddish-grey and buff, 913 feet in thickness,

plunging  st,'awai;ds  at  an  angle  from 4U° to  45°                    and, B,  the Stack conglomerates
                                                                       ;

and breccias, mare or less calcareous, red, sandy, and grey, 455 feet thick,' The

true base of these strata is concealed by the glacial drift, unless it be represented by

the Red Conglomerates of the small and obscure patches faulted into the shales near

Glenfaba. The Peel Sandstones are the equivalent of the Rot-todt-liegende of the

Continent, and the I>ower Permian Sandstones of St. Bees Head and the Yale of

Eden.

The Stack conglomerates and breccias represent the base of the Magnesian

Limestone of the Upper Permian, of the North of England, described so well by

Sedgwick and Binney. They are identical in physical characters with ' the brock-

ram' of the Cumbrian area, and are proved to be post-Carboniferous by the pre-

sence of pebbles of Carboniferous Limestone.

          The Strata underneath Drift-covered Northern Plain.

     The glacial drift occupies by far the greater portion of the island, and forms
a thick mantle over the plain, extending from the abrupt Ordovician escarpment,
sweeping westwards from Ramsey towards Kirk Michael. The contrast between
this plain and the hilly region to its south rendered it probable that the strata
underneath the drift are not Ordovician ; and the high northern dip of all the
rocks, Ordovician and Permian, rendered it probable that Carboniferous Rocks,
and possibly Coal Measures, occurred below. Under these circumstances four
borings were put down in 1891-90 by Messrs. Craine, Mr. Todd being the engineer
in charge, with the following results.

     The boring at Lhen Moar^ proved the existence of the Carboniferous Lime-
stone underneath the sands, clays, and gravels of the Drift at a depth of 167
feet (J inches from the surface. The limestone dips at an angle of 40°, and is
massive. It was penetrated to a depth of 66 feet.

     The next borehole at Ballawhane, near Blue Point, about 4,050 feet to the
north-east of that at Lhen Moar, gave a most interesting section.

In tliis section tlie Triassic Sandstone cores prove a dip of 10°, wHle the

Stack series below have a dip of from 30^ to 40°. The absence of the Peel Sand-

stones proves that the Permians are faulted against the Carboniferous Limestone,

The Triassic Sandstone probably belongs to the Lower or Bunter series.

   A third boring at Knock-y-Uooney, near Rue Point, at a distance of 1,670 yards

to the north-east of Ballawhane, recently completed, has added another group of

rocks to Manx geology. The section is as follows :

dipping at an angle of 30°, and passing into the Carboniferous Limestone, here,

                                        The Boulder-drift of the North,

     The Boulder-drift of the northern plain is deposited on a floor of solid rocks,
which sinks rapidly from 160 feet on the south-west at Ballawhane to 298 feet
below high-water mark on the north-east at the Point of Ayre. It is no less than
450 feet in thickness, when the cliffs aud hills of the plain are taken into account.
It contains the usual marine shells. Inland the drift occurs to a height of more
than 600 feet above the sea. The distribution of the Foxdale granite boulders
proves that the glaciation was from north to south.

                                              The Prehistoric Strata,

     With regard to the prehistoric river terraces, and alluvia, and the peat-beds
which are considerable in the north, I will only add that the discovery of the

great Irish Elk in the peat near St. John's, and in the forest on the shore-line near
tStrandhall, proves that the island was united to Ireland or Britain in the pre-

historic age.

2. Observations on some of the Footprints from the Trias in tha

          Neighioibrhood of Liverpool. By H. C. Beasley.

The footprints generally known as those of the Cheirotherium or Cheirosaurus

have been the subject of much speculation and some study for a long time past,

but unfortunately without any very certain result ; their general character is,

however, so well knowij that I hardly need refer to them. Besides this large and

rather singular form we have a great number and variety of smaller footprints.

A number of quite distinct forms may be traced, indicating that the fauna was
Arich both in individuals and in species.
                                           slab in University College, on which

about ninety-five footprints are shown on an area of about three square feet,

illustrates this. The footprints are generally found in relief as natural casts in

sandstone of prints made in the underlying marl or clay where the wet mud

has taken the impression and afterwards been covered with sand. They occur

most plentifully along certain beds, but this is because only at those places were

the conditions favourable for their presentation. The author particularly draws

attention to the fact that the prints indicate animals of terrestrial and not marine

habits ; for, although in older accounts webbed feet are described and figured, his

own observations point to these being of very rare occurrence. This would

necessitate the existence of dry land in the neighbourhood, and must be taken

into account in any attempt to understand the formation of the Keuper. They

are found at intervals from just above the conglomerates at the base to the lower part

of the Keuper marls, the highest beds of the Keuper exposed. They have not been

found in the Bunter in this district. The Liverpool Free Museum has lately acquired

a slab from Storeton which shows some interesting forms ; one, the largest about
two inches long, is possibly of a chelonian. In the less perfect examples it is

represented by an oval pad and four projecting points slightly removed from it on

one side, but in more perfect examples it is seen that these are connected by toes

with the pad, and that the projecting points are portions of strong curved claws.

On the slab it is difficult to trace a regular series, but from measurements taken at

the quarry from portions of the same bed the author found that the feet had a

--stride of about nine inches, whilst the width of the track that is, between the
--line of impressions of the right foot and those of the left was eight inches,

indicating a broad-bodied animal. Another footprint well shown on the slab is
much smaller, being about three-quarters of an inch long, and consists of three

-- --toes of nearly equal length the middle one being the longest and a very small

toe on one side projecting from what appears to be the palmar portion of the foot.

The three longer toes lie very closely together, and quite parallel, and often the

print shows no division between them, and each terminates in a short sharp claw.

This is the form described to the Geological Section by Mr. O. W. Jeffs at the

Oxford meeting.^ They are, perhaps, better shown on a slab from the same bed of

· Brit. Assoc. Report, 1894, p. 658.

rock in tlie museum <if University College. The slab also Las a profusion of the
prints attributed to the llhynchosaurus. The author has lately been endeavouring-
to classify under certain types the more common forms for the sake of facilitating
reference ; the results are given in his paper lately published.^ Any one interested
in the subject can see numerous examples in Liverpool Museum or at University
College. But perhaps the most interesting collection is that at the Bootle Free
Museum, where what are probably the type specimens described some sixty years

ago are carefully preserved and ·well exhibited.

3. Recent Borings in the Bed Marl, near Liverpool,
                 By G. H. MoRTOx, F.G.S.

Boring in the Bed Marl near Altcar, ^orth of Liverpool.

    During the years 1890-92 an important boring was made in the Red Marl;.
rather under a mile N.N.E. of Altcar, and nearly two miles east from Formby

Station. Previous to 1890 the fonuatimi was supposed not to exceed 400 feet in

    The diamond boring machine was used, and the diameter of the bore-hole was
13 inches near the surface, 7 and 6 inches through most of the Red Marl, and

   inches in the Keuper Sandstone. The dip of the strata was supposed to be a
few degrees to the north-east, as determined by the cores brought up. The marl
separated with thin laminse, and the surfaces were often covered with pseudo-
morphic crystals of chloride of sodium from an eighth to an inch across, and they
were most numerous in the middle and lowest beds. There were many seams of
gypsum, which varied in thickness from a quarter of an inch to 3 or 4 inches, and
a few diagonal cracks filled with the same mineral traversed the beds, and often
contained fragments of marl and presented a brecciated appearance. The surfaces
of the cores of gypsum exhibited pseudomorphs like those on the marl. Most of
1 he marl was red, but sometimes a greenish grey, and the lower beds contained
the tracks of annelids, which have been found on the same horizon in several
other places in Lancashire and Cheshire. The Keuper Sandstone below the Red
^larl was red and grey in colour, and there was an abrupt change from one
formation to tlie other without any transitional strata between.

     The object of the boring was to find brine or rock-salt, but it was unsuc-
cessful, and the attempt was made in consequence of a tradition that prevails in
the neighbourhood that salt water occurs below the surface. Mr. J. Dickinson,
F.G.S. , in his Parliamentary Report on "The Salt Districts,' refers to a brine
spring mentioned by Dr. Browning, and Baines, in his 'History of Lancashire,'
states that it 'contained as much salt as that at Northwich.' Mr. Fidler in-

formed me that, though salt water has been frequently found near the surface

in various places in the district, fresh water was found on penetrating to a

greater depth.

    I am inclined to think that the salt water found about the surface of the

country is in consequence of frequent floods from the sea in former years and

the deposit of spray during storms. The wind carries the fine spray for many

miles inland, and a film of salt has been found coating windows at a distance of
twenty or thirty miles from the sea after storms, so that it is certaia to impart a

Ealtness to the soil over the land along the coast.

Another boring in the Eed Marl has been in progress during the last two

vears on the east bank of the Fender, a brook running from south to north into
the Birkett and finally into "Wallasey Pool. The object of the boring was to

obtain an additional supply of water for Birkenhead, and 1 atn indebted to

The boring was made with a revolving iron di>c with steel chisels, two feet

in diameter, suspended by a Hut rope : but tlie cores brought up were only 4 inches

across, most of the rock having been broken into fragments, sand and clay. The

cores showed that the strata were horizontal. The lied Marl was found to be

much harder than usual, and principally composed of tough argillaceous sand-

Gtones and shales, nearly all of a red colour. Very little gypsum was found, and

the entire absence of pseudomorphic crystals remarkable. It seems probable

that the deposit was formed in deeper water than the Red Marl at Altcar.

At Greasbj', a village two miles west of the boring, there are some beds, about
^two inches thick, containing small ramifying tube-like cavities from
                                                                       to n^y inch

in diameter. They have been supposed to be at the base of the Red Marl, but

were found at several horizons in the boring, and evidently do not indicate the

base, so that the beds at Greasby may be considerably above it. The Red Marl

ended at the depth of 516 feet below the surface, so that deducting G2 feet for the

superficial deposits the thicKness is 4")4 feet, being about double the amount it

was expected to be. There was an abrupt change from the Red Marl into the

underlying Keuper Sandstone, which was penetrated to the depth of 244 feet,

·when a fault was crossed and the Upper Soft Sandstone of the Bunter proved to

the depth of 133 feet.

    The Geological Survey Map of the district (Sheet 79, X.E.) distinguishes the
Red Marl from the * AVaterstones ' at the base over the centre of Wirral, but it

does not seem possible to have made such a distinction in South-west Lancashire,

where both are included in the Red 3Iarl. At Ford most of the marl is of an

arenaceous character, while on the east of Liverpool the beds are softer and include

more shale and clay. It seems, however, that the Keuper Sandstone in Wirral is

of less thickness than it is under Liverpool, and that the upper beds there are

represented by the ' Waterstones.'

    4. Erosion of the Sea Coast of Wirral. By G. H. Morton, F.G.S.

   The oldest maps of the coast of Wirral, the north-western extremity of Cheshire,

afford very little information on the exact outline of the coast in former years. It

was not until the publication of the C-inch map of the Ordnance Survey in 1880
that it became possible to make exact observations on the erosion of the coast.
The late Sir James Picton, F.S.A., in 1840, was the first to direct attention to the
waste of the land, but he had not made any personal investigation, and more

recent writers on the subject have confined themselves to showing the incorrect-
ness of some of his statements, rather than making original observations. The
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              '

782 EEPORT-- 189G.

object of this paper is to record the result of close attention given to the subject

for many years.
     Half a mile south-west of the Leasowe Embankment, and about 100 yards from

Seabank Cottages, there is an old weather-beaten brick and stone house, known as

the ' Warren,' and evidently the oldest in the neighbourhood. According to the
6-inch Ordnance Map, the distance between the house and the sea was about 130

yards, when the country was surveyed in 1871, but I found it to be 70 yards in
1890, 55 yards in March 1894, and only 45 yards in May 1896, and the residents
have shown me the position of several high sand-hills that once formed part of the

lost land.

     In an affidavit, filed in a recent case concerning the extension of the Embank-
ment, George Banks states that he had been born and had lived in the house ever
since. It was only 60 yards from high-water mark af spring tides in 1892,
' whereas when he first remembered it the house stood at least 350 yards from
high-water mark at spring tides, and the land washed away included some sand-

hills 30 and 40 feet, and one 50 or 00 feet in height.'
      The greatest erosion by the sea along the coast has taken place at Dove Point,

 about 350 yards to the south-west of the house. In 1862 there were two ' perches
 constructed of timber, one being 10 yards from the edge of the sand-hills, which
 were then about 12 feet liigh, and the other 150 yards behind, near the boundary
 of the inclosed land. The seaward Perch is shown in the frontispiece of the

 ' Geology around Liverpool.' On January 20, 1863, this Perch had become close
 to the edge of the clifl" and fell down on the shore, its original position being indi-

 cated by several masses of masom-y and large stones which had formed the foun-
 dation of the structure. The Perch was re-erected on the sand-hills, and is shown
 on the 6-inch map, but it was afterwards removed, with the one behind, to the

 north-east of the ' Warren,' so that neither of them is now in the place shown on

 the map. The foundation stones still lie on the shore in their original position.
 In consequence of the continual erosion by the sea the stones have gradually
 become further from the coast line, and in September 1894 the distance was 144
 yards, showing the erosion of the coast from 1863 to 1894 to have been between

 4 and 5 yards per annum. In May 1896 the distance had been increased to 152

 yards, proving an erosion of 8 yards in 20 months, but as they included two
 winters the loss would be 4 yards per annum.

       Soutli of Dove Point the erosion gradually decreases, but 50 yards of the sand-
 hills have been washed away on the north-east of Sandhey, though not in recent
 years, i'.s there is now a fringe of grass growing in the denuded bay for about 100
 yards, when it gradually dies away. The grounds along the sea-front at Sandhey
 are protected by an embankment and groins, which arrest the encroachment of the
 sea. Beyond, in front of Iloylake, there is no erosion, and the lied Stones at
 Ililbre Point protect ihe land from the sea.

 5, Oscillations in the Level of the Land as shoiun hy the Buried River

      Valleys and later Deposits in the Neighhourhood of Liverpool. By

      T. Mkllard Reade, F.G.S.

      The author, after describing the extensive post-Glacial deposits on the coasts of
 Ijancashire and Cheshire, consisting of blown sand resting upon a peat- and forest-

 --bed, which again rests upon scrobicularian clays and silts the tree remains, con-

  sisting of stools of oak, Scotch fir, and birch rooted into the estuarine deposits-
  shows that the whole series rest upon an eroded surface of the low-level marine
  Boulder-clays and Sands, which again repose upon the Ti iassic rocks. The surface
  of the Trias, whether Bunter or Keuper, is worn into a system of hills and valleys
  Tvliich are largely obscured and filled up with Boulder-clay.

        After a discussion of these facts the author concludes that they point to the

 --existence of three land surfaces the first in time being pre-Glacial or at least

 pre-Boulder-clay ; the second, post-Glacial, represented by the buried eroded surface
TRANSACTIONS OF 8ECTI0X C.  783

of the Boulder-clay, and the third by the peat- and forest-beds which run down to

below low-water mark.

     All these land surfaces represent periods when the land was hifrher relatively
to the sea-level than at present, the deposits restin;? se^evally upon them represent-
ing each a period of depression when the laud was relatively lower, as respects the

sea, than at present.

     It was pointed out that these indubitable earth-movements could not be
accounted for on the principle of isostasy, or loadinu- aud unloading, nor could they
be explained away by alterations of the sea-level, nor by subterranean denudation,

aud that we must therefore look for their e.xplanation.not to external causes, but to
forces acting over large areas and hidden deep down in the interior of the earth.

      6. Tertiary Dejjosits in North JIanxIand. By Alfred Bell.

     After suggesting that local agencies were sulticient to account for the glacial
phenomena in the centre and soutli of the island, the writer proceeds to give

reasons in support of his proposition that the deposits in tlie north, instead of
being, as usually supposed, of glacial origin, are really pre-Glacial, as he finds that
there are no traces of till or a ground moraine, and that the clays tiiroughout are

to a large extent free from stony matter, except such as may have been due to

floating ice, brought in after the shingle beach with Pliocene shells had been
formed.

     The shells he does not consider ' remanie,' but contemporaneous with the beach
they occur in, and to belong to the same series of pre-Glacial deposits containing
similar shells at Wexford, Aberdeen, and Iceland, of Weybourn Crag age, possibly
an unopened chapter in Pliocene geology.

     Not finding any shingle in the clifls, he concludes that the rolled stones on the
beach are far travelled, having no connection with the island deposits.

     The list of shells is the first localised one of any of the deposits in the island,
and is supplemented by notices of such species as wi-re not personally collected by
him at Shellag.

     7. On the Occurrence of SiUimanite Gneisses in Central Anglesey,
                            By Edward Greenly, F.G.S.

     The author records the occurrence of the mineral SiUimanite in certain gneisses
and schists of Central Anglesey, which are traversed by great numbers of sills and
thin bands of growth, often injected ' lit par lit.' There is an absence of chilled
edges, the granite being quite coarse at the points of contact which have been
observed. The whole series closely resembles that recently described in eastern

Sutherland by Mr. J. Home and the author, but it is also associated with the

hornblendic gneisses, whose Hebridean or Lewisian aspect has been noted by Sir
A. Geikie.

     8. On Quartzite Lenticles in the Schists of South-eastern Anglesey,
                             By Edward Greenly, F.G.S.

     The author describes the occurrence of numerous lenticles of quarlzite in the
chloritic schists of Beaumaris. They are generally from quarter of an inch to a
foot in length, but four large masses also occur, of which the largest, the quartz-
rock of I'en-y-parc, is a lenticle some 700 feet in length. These quartzite lenticles
are ascribed to a cataclastic origin, the structures resembling on a large scale

(except that the matrix is crystalline) those of themylonites of the N.W. Highlands

of Scotland. The author also compares them to the ' crush-conglomerates ' of the
Isle of Man. The whole series is probably due to the breaking down of a group
                                      --

of alternating shales and thin grits, containinj? also a few thick beds of quartzite.
Their present condition furnishes evidence of the intensity of the earth-movements
which have affected the schistose rocks of Anglesey.

              FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER Ls.

The following Papers and Report were read :

1. Pre-Camhrian Fossils. By Sir William Dawsox, LL.D., F.K.S.

The author stated that it was his object merely to introduce the specimens he

proposed to exhibit by a few remarks j'eiidered necessary by the present confusion

in the classification of pre-Cambrian rocks. He would take those of Canada and

Newfoundland as at present best known-, and locally connected with the specimens

in question.

NewHe referred first to the ' Olenelliis Zone,' and its equivalent in  Brunswick,

the 'Protolenus Fauna' of Matthew, as at present constituting the base of the
Cambrian and terminating downward in barren sandstone. This Lower Cambrian

had in Xorth America, accordinfr to Walcott, atl'orded IGo species, including all

the leading tj-pes of tlie marine invertebrates.

    JJelow the Olenellus Zone, Matthew liad found in Xew Brunswick a thiclc

series of red and greenish slates, with conglomerate at the base. It has afforded

no Trilobites, but contains a few fossils referable with some doubts to AVorms,

Mollusks, Ostracods, Brachiopods, Cytideans, and Protozoa. It is regarded as

equivalent to the Signal Hill and IJandom Sound Series of Murray and Ilowley in

Newfoundland, and to the Kewenian, aud the C'huar and Colorado Canon Series

of Walcott in the west. Tlie latter contains laminated forms apparently similar

to Cryptozoon of the Cambrian and Arch.'eozoon of the Upper Laurentian.

The Etchcminian rests unconformabl}' on the Iluronian, a system for the most

part of coarse clastic rocks with some igneous beds, but including slates, iron

ores, and limestones, which contain worm-burrows, sponge-spicules, and laminated

forms comparable with Cryptozoon and Eozoon. The Iluronian, first defined by

Logan and Murray in the Georgian liay of Lake Huron, lias been recognised in

many other localities, both in the west and east of Canada and the L'nited States;

but has been designated by many other local names, and has been by some writers

included, with the Etcheminian and sometimes with part of the Laurentian, in the

scarcely defined 'Algonkian ' group of the United States Geological Survey.

     Below the Huroniau is the Copper Laurentian or Greuville system, consisting of
gneisses and schists (some of wliicb, as Adams has shown, have the chemical com-

position of Palreozoic slates), along with iron ore, graphite, and apatite, and great

bands of limestone, the whole evidently representing a long period of marine

deposition, in an ocean whose bed was broken up find in part elevated before the

productionof the littoral elastics of the Iluronian age. It is in one of the lime-

stones of this system that, along with other possible fossils, the forms known a^^

Eozoo7i Canadcnse have been found. The author did not propose to describe these

remains, but merely to exhibit some microphotograplis and slices iliustrating their

structure, referring to previous publications for details as to their characters and
mode of occurrence.

Below the Grenvillian is the great thickness of Ortlioclase gneiss of various

textures, and alternating with bands of hornblende schist, constituting the Ottawa

gneiss or Lower Laurentian of the Geological Survey. No limestones or indica-
tions of fossil remains have yet been found in this fundamental gueiss, which may

be a truly primitive rock produced by aqueo-igneous or ' crenitic ' action, before
the commencement of regular sedimentation.

The author proposed, with Matthew, to regard the Etcheminian series and its

equivalents as pre-Cambrian, but still PaliEozoic ; and, as suggested by himself

many years ago, to classify the Iluronian and Grenvillian as Eozoic, leaving tho

term Arcbrean to he applied to llie Lower Laurentian gneiss, until it also shall
have afforded some indications of the presence of life.

    He insisted on the duty of palnsontologists to givf more attention to the pre-

Cambrian rocks, in the hope of discoverinpr connecting links with the Cambrian,
and of finding the oceanic members of the Huroniaii, and less metamorphosed equi-
valents of the Upper Laurentian, and so of reaching backward to the actual

beginning of life on our planet, should this prove to be attainable.

2. Sotne Features of the Early Cambrian luania.o. By G. F. Matthew,

                                             D.Sc, F.R.S.C.

                                           Trilchites.

     The larval features of the early Camhrian Trilobites are chiefly referred to in
this paper because in them we may look for points of structure which will appear

in the adult condition of their pi'edecessors.

     The early Cambrian Brachiopoda and Ostrocoda are also briefly considered.

      Except in Olenellus and its allies the larval forms of the earliest trilobites are

little known ; but in those of the Paradoxides beds a number of them belonging to
different genera are known, so that in these we have fuller data for comparison.

     The abundance and variety of trilobites in the Cambrian rocks are truly
remarkable; and the flexibility of the type is indicated by the numerous genera
that appeared successively in that early age. They thus become valuable in
marking the divisions of these rocks, as the vertebrates do those of the Tertiary
and their remains enable us to recognise difl'erent parts of the Cambrian system

with ease and certainty in all the regions around the Atlantic ocean.

     This being the case, it may be profitable to examine the forms of the earliest
Cambrian trilobites, and note how they compare with the larvae of the trilobites of
the Paradoxides beds. The law of development would lead us to expect that in

the pre-Paradoxides faunas of the Cambrian certain features of the larval forms of
the trilobites of the Paradoxides beds should appear as permanent adult features

in their predecessors. .\.nd such is the case.

In 1892 Dr. J. Bergeron summed up the evidence on this point, derivable

from the trilobites of the Paradoxides and Olenellus faunas, in his article, " Is the

fauna  called       primordial  the  most  ancient  fauna r  "'        lie utilised the studies of
                                                                    '

Barrande, Walcott, Pord, and others for this purpose, and his conclusion was that

tliere must have been a more ancient fauna.

Discoveries of other faunas beside that of Olenellus, older than the Paradoxides

beds, have been made since Bergeron wrote upon this subject, and we may now

place his theory against some additional facts which boar upon it.

To make the application clearer, the author briefly presented some of the

characteristics of the earliest larval stages of the trilobites of the Paradoxides

beds, as shown in the young of Paradoxides, Ptychoparia, Conccoryphe, Microdiscus,

and Agnostus. Among them are the following :

     1. Predominance of the cephalic over the caudal shield.

   A2. long narrow glabella, with nearly parallel sides. In these early moults

the posterior lobes of the axial rachis (which includes the glabella) are short and
weak, as compared with the anterior, and especially the first.

     3. The eyes are absent ; when they first appear they are near the lateral
margin, and in several genera are elongated.

     4. There are no movable cheeks ; when these first appear they are narrow and

marginal.

     5. There is no tli<irax ; this region begins with one segment, and in some
genera never exceeds the number of 2 to 4. The pleurie at first are short.

     G. The pygidium at first is quite short and of one segment.

786 REPORT-- 1896.

     Three local faunas, all older than Paradoxides, have been made known since
Bergeron's paper was written. They all show more or less the increasing-
prevalence of larval features in the trilobites as we go back in time. J. C. Moberg
has described a number of species from Sweden, including two species of Olenellus,
in which some of the above larval characters are shown.

     J. F. Pompeckj has just described a pre-Paradoxides fauna from Bohemia in
which are a few trilobites that possess larval characters. Thus his Ptychoparia is

referred to sub-genus Oonocephalites, probably because it has a long eyelobe.^ It

is a primitive form with short pleurje, if we may judge from the short posterior

extension of the dorsal suture. His Solenopleiu-a also diflers from that genus in
its long eyelobe and long glabella, but these also are larval features. Another
species of Solenopleura, however, cited by Pompeckj, has shorter eyelobes.

     It is the Protolenus fauna of the St. John group (Cambrian), however, which
shows most decidedly larval traits in its adult trilobites.

    Among these trilobites all (so far as their remains show it) have prolonged
eyelobes, a peculiarity which marks the .early Olenidfe. Many of them have long
cylindrical glabellas, also a larval character. Many have a short posterior extension
of the dorsal suture, indicating the primitive feature of short pleurse. Many have

small and weak pygidia ; this is inferred from the rarity of this part of the organism

in the collections preserved.

     Protolenus (typical), which has a general resemblance to Paradoxides, diflers
from it in the absence of a clavate glabella, and the small anterior lobe of this part
of the head-shield ; but these are characters found in the larval stages of

Paradoxides.

   A genus of this fauna, although not as common as Protolenus, is EUipsocephalus

this genus also abounds with Protaspian peculiarities.

    Lastly, one may refer to the genus Micmacca, which has the following larval

features, long cylindrical glabella, long eyelobes, short posterior extension of the
dorsal suture. If Zacanthoides, of the middle Cambrian, were shorn of its long

posterior extension of this suture and its long pleurje, it would not diSer greatly
from Micmacca.

      In the Olenellus fauna, also, are genera such as Olenellus, Protypus, Avalonia,
and Oleuelloides, which retain marked larval characters.

                                                          Brachiopoda.

    If we turn our attention to the Brachiopoda, we note that they show a special

development in the early Cambrian, different from that of the Paradoxides beds,
and the later members of the Cambrian system.

     The most notable feature is the large percentage of Obolidffi (including
Siphonotretinse). The older Cambrian holds in common with the Paradoxides
beds, the small shells of Acrothele, Acrotreta, and Linnarssonia ; but it also has a
series of larger forms peculiar to it : such are Obolus, Botsfordia, Trematobolus and
Siphonotreta of the Protolenus fauna, and Schizambon and Michwitzia of the
Olenellus fauna. This great development of oboloid shells is not repeated until

Ordovician time.

     Not only are these old Cambrian faunas remarkable for the peculiar types of

ABrachiopods which they possess, but they are also notable for those they lack.

true Lingula has not been found, though Liugulella is a common genus.
     The larval growths of Ordovician and Silurian Lingulae carry us back to a form

which is Oboloid. Thus in L. quadrata, L. Hoxdeyi, &c., the cell is first circular
as in Obolus, then oval as in L. Quebecensis, &c., and finally takes on the sub-
quadrate form of the adult shell. But there is a more elementary form of the
Brachiopod shell than the circular shell of Obolus : this is seen in Paterina and the
young sheU of Botsfordia, which is nearly semicircular. Both these shells come
from beds that are older than Paradoxides.

     * In the lai-val forms of I'tychoparia and Solenopleura of the Paradoxides beds,
however, the eyelobe is short.

Such are the types represented in Beyrichona and Hipponicharion ; such also are
 those with flexible tests represented by Aluta. Other Ostracoda are present in
more varied forms than in the Paradoxides beds.

    To sum up these distinctive features of the animals of the earliest Cambrian
faunas, we may say

     1. That the Trilobites retain larval characteristics to an unusual degree.
    2. The Brachiopoda have a large percentage of Obolidte.
    3. The Ostracoda are plentiful and varied, and present some peculiar types.

4^ The Range of S'2}ecies in the Carboniferous Limestone of I^orth Wales.

                              By G. H. MoETOX, F.G.S.

     Attention having recently been directed to this subject, I have been induced

to present the results of many years' collecting in the Carboniferous Limestone of
North Wales. The formation there presents tour well-defined subdivisions, each

--of them, with the exception of the highest, having distinct lithological characters,

viz. Lower Brown Limestone, Middle White Limestone, Upper Grey Limestone,
and the Upper Black Limestone. Lists of the fossils have been made, collected
more or less continuously along the country from each subdivision.

     In North Wales the occurrence and succession of the species in the subdivisions
vary in difierent areas, and the larger the area examined the more difiicult it
becomes to find species peculiar to certain horizons. In order to obtain a definite
result, I have compiled three separate lists of the species obtained in that number
of distinct areas. There are the Llangollen, the Flintshire, and the Vale of
Clwyd Lists. Each of the lists shows the relative scarcity and abundance, and the
range of the species in the subdivisions ; and although future search will doubtless
add to the rare and occasional species, the number and range of the commoa
and very common must be very nearly correct. Neither the rare nor the occa-
sional species are of much use in defining distinct horizons in consequence of
their rarity, and it is only the common and very common species that can be
expected to indicate a definite horizon or zone. In North Wales a great difficulty
arises from the occurrence of all the common and very common species in the
Upper Grey Limestone, with the exception of Producius comoides, and although
all pass downwards, they become scarce in consequence of the general paucity of

fossils in the inferior subdivisions.

     In the Llangollen List there are 69 rare, 28 occasional, 16 common, and 27 very-
common species. Deducting Foraminifera, which are not in the other lists, there
are 36 species that are common and very common, and they all occur in the Upper
Grey Limestone, with the exception of Posidorximi/a Gibsniii from higher strata,
and Productus comoides in the Lower Brown Limestone, all the other species in
the list being rare and occasional forms.

     In the Flintshire List there are 92 rare, 35 occasional, 30 common, and 11
very common species, and of the 41 common and very common, 37 species occur
in the Upper Grey Limestone, 4 of the remaining species, Pimdonomya Becheri,
Avicidopecten granosus, and A. papt/racci/s occurring in the Upper Black Lime-
stone, and Productus comoides in the Lower Brown Limestone.

    In the Vale of Clwyd List, which includes the Great Orme's Head, there are
16 rare, 22 occasional, 12 common, and 10 very common species ; and of the
22 common and very common, 21 species occur in the Upper Grey Limestone, the
exceptional species being Productus comoides. None of the 21 species are peculiar

to the subdivision, for tliey all occur in the underlyiug- Middle "Wliite Limestone.

The number in the list is less than in the others, on account of the Upper Grey
Limestone havincr been considerably denuded in the Vale of Clwyd.

     Nearly the whole of the common and verj^ common fossils occur in each of the

three lists, for there are few that are not found in all the areas.

     Of the numerous common and very common species found in the Carboniferous

Limestone of North Wales, it is impossible to find any that are restricted to
horizons of less importance than the subdivisions into which the formation is

naturally divided. An examination of the first appeaj-ance and continuity of the

species seems to indicate that they were introduced from some pre-existing area,
and that the upper beds of the fi)nnation are more recent than in Derbyshire and

Yorkshire, where the thickness of the Limestone is very much greater.
     The sudden appearance of species in restricted areas, like those found in the

Upper Grey Limestone at Axton, in Flintshire, where 20 species occur, and at
Graig-fawr, in the Middle White Limestone, where 6 species occur, not found
elsewhere in North ^^'oles; and the early appearance of 3 species in beds of black
limestone and shale at the base of the Middle "White Limestone at the Gre?t
Orme's Head seem to indicate migration from some other area. The latter species
ars Orthis Michelinn, Spirifera humerosn, and 6'. rotundata. S2)irifcra Immerosa had
only been previously found at Llangollen and in Flintshire, while S. rotundaht
is rare in North AVales ; but none of the 3 species had been previously found at a
lower horizon than the I pper Grey Limestone. ProdDcfn^ f/if/anteufi first appears
in the Lower Brown Limestone, and very large specimens occur within 50 feet
from the base at Moel Iliraddug, a few miles from Rhyl. The species occur all

through the Carboniferous Limestone, and thousands may be seen in the Upper
Grey Limestone.

     In this paper the range of the species found is confined to North AVales, but

when the subdivisions of the (Jarboniferons Limestone in other parts of the
country are worked out, and the species from each tabulated, it will be interesting

to compare the result with that obtained in North AA'ales.

 ·5. On the Sonrc of Lara. By J. Logan Lobley, F.G.S., Professor of

              Astronotuii and Phys'w<jraphy, City of London College.

     The object of this paper, which was illustrated by diagrams, was to show that
small columns of lava cannot pajs through thirty miles of earth crust, and that
thereforethesourceoflavacannot.be at that distance from the surface, as is so
often assumed

     The reasons adduced were :
      First, that from the pressure of overlying rocks there can be no fissures
giving a passage to lava below ten miles from the surface, since this pressure,
much greater than the crushing weight of rocks, would cause lateral extension
where possible.
     Secondly, if even a way were open, lava rising from a source thirty miles
deep, would by contact with cooler rock masses lose its fluidity at twenty miles
from the surface. The temperature of lava at i's source cannot be very much
greater than that of the contiguous solid rocks, and lava would lose heat continuously
and increasingly as it ascended the volcanic conduit. The temperature at twenty
miles below the surface is much under rock-fusion temperature, and the lava-
columns giving small or even moderate emissions are so insignificant in volume
that they would there be so cooled as to solidify. Estimates of the volume of
lava-columns were given in illustration ; and it was further shown that a column
of lava 300 feet in diameter and thirty miles high would require a dynamic force

«f 820,800,000 tons to sustain it even without ejection.
     The author's conclusion is that lava is not derived from ' a central source, but

that, in accordance with his previously stated hypothesis, by comhined physical
and chemical action rocks are fused and lava produced within the outer rind of
the globe often miles in thickness.

6. On the Post-Cambrian Shrinkage of the Globe. By J. Logan Loeley,
     F.G.S., Professor of Astronomy and Physiography, City of London

        College.

     The author, having previously shown that a shrinkage of the globe sufficient to
produce the rock-foldings of post-Cambrian times would require an interior tem-

perature previous to the shrinkage 5,000° F. higher than now,' in the present paper
gave his reasons for concluding that such a temperature of the interior mass of tho
globe w-ould give a surface temperature that would render impossible those

geological agencies of erosion and sedimentation which the Cambrian strata show
to have been in full operation when those rocks were formed.

      Calculations founded on the British Association rate of increase of underground
temperature, both on the supposition of a solid globe and of one with a fused
interior, showed that with an increase of 5,000° F. tlie surface tempei'ature would be

very much above the critical point of water, the existence of which on the surface
would be thereby rendered impossible.

     It was further shown that if the author's estimate of the increase of internal
temperature required is too high, and only 1,000° F. increase be allowed for the
interior heat in Cambrian times, the surface temperature would even then be quite
incompatible with known Cambrian conditions.

     The author's conclusion is that since Cambrian times there has been no appreci-
able loss of planetary heat, and consequently no appreciable shrinkage of the
globe ; and that therefore another explanation must be found for rock-crushino-,
rock-folding, elevations, and subsidences of land areas, the uprise and issue of
lava and of seismic phenomena.

   A table was appended showing the temperature of isogeotherms for every mile-

of thickness of an earth-crust of thirty miles, with a base temperature of 3,f 00° F.

     7. On the Cause of the Bathymetric Limit of Pteropod Ooze.
                       By Percy F. Kendall, F.G.S.

--Preliminary. Two forms of carbonate of lime are known to the mineralogist.

lower temperatures. Both forms occur in organic structures, and it is found that
Aragonite structures when deprived of animal matter are opaque, while Calcite
structures are translucent. There is no perceptible difference in solubility between,
the two mineral species when dealt with in powder or when of inorganic origin -
but in porous formations of every geological age it is found that Aragonite shells,,
of whatever thickness, disappear by solution before thin and delicate Calcite shells
of Foraminifera and Polyzoa are even sensibly affected. It is probable that
Aragonite is penetrated by extremely slender fibrillse of organic matter, whose
removal produces the characteristic opacity.

   --Solvent action of sea-zvater. Sea-water exercises a solvent action upon cal-

careous bodies, especially upon and about coral reefs and in the profound depths.
The solvent is almost certainly carbonic acid disengaged from decomposing organic
matter. The ' Challenger ' observations show that carbonic acid is present in great;

abundance in the bottom water at great depths ; it is further known that solution
is rendered much more rapid by the immense pressures prevailing in deep water.

Meeting, 1804, p. CJ9.
790 KEPORT-- 1896.

It follows from this that the calcareous parts of the inhabitants of the ' benthos '

would he liable to solution during life, unless {a) they were protected by the flesh

of the animal or by epidermis, or (h) they consisted of Calcite.

The deep-sea mollusca are mainly composed of Aragonite, but they generally

have an extremely thick epidermis. The deep-sea calcareous corals are almost

exclusively simple forms, and the lower portion of stony structure is gradually left

bare as the creature grows. All the forms examined by the author, eg., Caryo-

phyllia, Parasmilia, Cyclocyathus, Stephanophyllia,' are of Calcite, whereas nearly

all reef-building Actinozoa produce Aragonite structures.

   --The effects of solution upon the nature and distribution of deep-sea deposits.

Deep-sea deposits are mainly derived from two sources : (a) land detritus and vol-

canic ejecta carried seaward by currents (b) remains of free-swimming pelagic
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

organisnis. Inshore the deposits usually contain a large percentage of detrital

materials, while towards the deep the organic remains tend to preponderate. As

the water deepens another factor, solution, comes into play, and the calcareous

elements of the deposits are progressively removed by solution. The solution is,

according to Murray, Agassiz, and others, effected in part during the slow sinking

of surface organisms, and in part while lying upon the floor of the ocean. Agassiz

assigns the greater importance to solution during descent, but the fact recorded by

him, that ' the more numerous the shells are in the surface waters, the greater

is the depth at which they will accumulate at the bottom,' seems to show that

solution at the bottom is very considerable. In the profoundest depths the deposits

consist almost wholly of non-calcareous materials. Two principal calcareous

deposits occur below 500 fathoms, viz., Globigerina ooze, which covers 49^ million

square miles of the ocean floor and has a bathymetric range from 400 to 2,926

fathoms, and Pteropod ooze, which is a Gloliigerina ooze characterised by the

presence of a large number of shells of Pteropods and Ileteropods. It occurs only

where the surface waters are warm, and hence is limited to tropical and sub-

tropical regions. It covers an area of 400,000 square miles, and ranges in depth

from 395 fathoms to 1,525 fathoms, below which the Pteropod shells disappear,

leaving a normal Globigerina ooze. It is generally agreed that the limitation in

depth of the Pteropod remains is due to soUitiou, for the living Pteropods swarm

over the surface in prodigious numbers, whatever be the depths below.

Agassiz succinctly states the facts as follows : ' The Pteropod and Heteropod

shells are the first to disappear from deposits, then the more delicate surface

Foraminifera, and finally the larger and heavier ones.' The fact that these rela-

tively large shells wholly disappear by solution under conditions that the minute

Foraminifera survive is beyond doubt, and demands explanation. Several explana-

tions have been proposed. Fuchs in 1877 suggested that Globigerina might be

composed of Calcite and the Pteropods of Aragonite, and the author independ-

ently made the same suggestion. Dr. Murray and the AbbtJ Renard, however,

rejected that hypothesis, and considered that the Globigerina survived by reason

of their greater thickness.

The author, with the assistance of Mr. Albert Jowett, a student in the

Geological Laboratory of the Yorkshire College, has made a number of determina-

tions of the relative thickness of Globigerina and Orbulina, the most characteristic

Foraminifera of the deep-sea oozes and of Styliola and Cavolinia as representing

the Pteropods. lie failed to find any such difference of thickness as would account

for the much greater durability of the Foraminifera, the range of thickness of the
two classes being practically identical. It may be represented by the numbers

2-6'5 in each case.

W.The mineral constitution was also successfully determined. Prof.     J.

SoUas determined the sp. gr. of Globigerina by an extremely ingenious adaptation

of heavy solutions to be approximately that of Calcite. This has been confirmed

by the author, who has also obtained a uniaxial optical figure from specimens of

Orbulina, showing that the low sp. gr. is due to Calcite constitution, and not to

the presence of animal matter.

' These are corals of deep-sea types from the Cretaceous rocks.
                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                    791

    Similar tests were applied to the Pteropods Cavolinia and Stiliola. No com-

pletely satisfactory optical figure could be obtained, though the optical test seemed

to indicate a biaxial substance (Aragonite) ; but the sp. gr. determinations many

--times repeated were conclusive that those Pteropod-genera are Aragonite.
     Conclusions: 1. The effect of difference of thickness of calcareous shells upon
their rate of solution is quite insignificant in comparison with that of difference of
mineral constitution; thus in the Coralline Crag shells of Valuta and Cyprina
(Aragonite), a third of an inch thick, have been quite removed, while the delicate
Polyzoa (Calcite) which encrusted them are perfectly preserved, together with

remains of Vitreous Foraminifera (Calcite).

     2. There is no noteworthy difference in thickness between the Pteropods and

Globigerinte.

     3. Pteropod-shells consist of Aragonite, while Globigerina and all other
Vitreous Foraminifera examined are composed of Calcite.

     4. The disappearance of Pteropods at 1,500 fathoms, while the Globigerina
extend to 2,925 fathoms, is due to the mineral character of the shells, and"not to

their thickness.

8. On the Conditions under which the Upper Chalk tvas deposited.
                      By Percy F. Kendall, F.G.S.

     Attempts to determine the approximate depth of the Chalk sea from the
comparison of the Cretaceous fauna with the MoUuscan inhabitants of the existing

seas are unsatisfactory, because there are no grounds for the belief that the low

temperatures at present found in the ocean depths prevailed in Cretaceous times;

hence temperature did not limit distribution to the extent that it does now.

     Solution dependent upon the depth of water would, however, act as it does in
existing seas, and the author has applied certain principles stated in another paper
read before the Section to the case of the Upper Chalk.

Calcareous organisms consist in some cases of aragonite, and in others of

calcite. Aragonite in organic structures is so much more soluble than calcite
(though of identical chemical composition) that gigantic aragonite shells may be

completely dissolved, while calcite Foraminifera exposed to exactly the same

conditions remain perfectly preserved.

     The distribution in depth of the Pteropod Ooze of the tropical seas indicates the
depth at which slender aragonite shells are dissolved. Pteropods swarm in the

surface waters in such numbers that the sea is literally thick with them, yet, bein"
composed of aragonite, their remains practically disappear from the oozes in depths

exceeding 1,500 fathoms, and only sporadic examples are met with. The remains

of globigerinse, which live side by side with the pteropods, survive by virtue of
their calcite composition down to 2,925 fathoms, nearly twice the depth. These

facts seem to show that 1,500 fathoms is the depth at which the more delicate

aragonite shells yield to solution.

    Turning to the Upper Chalk, we find that all aragonite structures, large and

small, have been wholly dissolved away, while calcite Foraminifera and Polyzoa

are well preserved and retain their fine markings.

The question arises. When did the solution take place ? To this we may answer

with some confidence that it has been eflected mainly prior to consolidation for

robust shells. The Cephalopoda fui-nish the best illustrations of these facts ; the

phragmoccne of Belemnitella mucronata, an aragonite structure, has never been

found in this country, though the guards (calcite) occur by thousands. If the

solution of the phragmocones had taken place subsequently to deposition, empty

alveoli  would  be found                                      but in no case has the author seen a Belemnitella in this

   _ Casts of Ammonites (aragonite) are very rare in the Upper Chalk, such as occur
being usually of very large size, but the Aptychi (calcite) of small species are

occasionally found well preserved. Many considerations render it probable that

the consolidation of the chalk took place concurrently with deposition ; for example,
hands of rolled nodules of chalk occur at varions horizons, and the same is probably

the case with the Globig-erina ooze of the existing: oceans, for the ' Challenger

dredged nodules of hardened ooze from a depth of 1,700 fathoms.
     The author concludes that the Upper Chalk was probably deposited in a depth

of at least 1,500 fathoms, a conclusion which Dr. Hume and Mr. Jukes Browne

appear to have reached by entirely different methods.

 9. The Ilighwood Mountnlns of Montana and Magmatic Differentiation.

        A Criticism. Bjj H. J. Johnston-Lavis, M.D., F.G.S., dr.

    The author brings forward a new interpretation of the facts described by

Messrs. W. II. Weed and L. V. Pirrsson ('Bull. Ceol. Soc.,' America, vol. vi.

pp. 389-422, pts. 24-26) in their account of the remarkably interesting volcanic
region of the Ilighwood mountains, \vith reference, more especially, to Square

Butte.

     This mountain they show to be a dismantled laccolite intrusion into Cretaceous
sandstones. The peripheral part of this intrusion is composed of a dark basic rock,
that they call shonkinite, containing about 47 per cent, of silica, poor in alumina
and alkalies, but rich in iron, lime, and magnesia. The core is composed of a white
syenite containing about 57 per cent, of silica, is rich in alumina and alkalies, but
poor in iron and alkaline earths. The authors conclude, tlierefore, that this is a
case of magmatic differentiation in which the bases have concentrated to the sides

by a process of diffusion or liquation.
     The author suggests that what really took place at Square Butte was as

follows : In the first stage a conduit containing a paste sensibly approaching the
syenite in composition was injected into the Jurassic and other basic sedimentary
rocks subjacent to the Cretaceous sandstone, which forms a more superficial part of the
orio-inal country. Here the upper intratelluric portion of the intrusion underwent
Gasification by interosmotic action with the conduit walls. lu the second stage this,

now shonkinite, paste or magma was pushed on and formed a blister or laccolite

in the sandstone smaller than the complete one of Square Butte. This, having
undergone partial lapidification and becoming highly viscous, was in turn pushed
up and aside by the intrusion of the syenite. This latter paste had probably re-
mained a shorter time in the conduit, the walls of which had already been in part
exhausted in osmotic interchange or diffusion by the earlier batch of paste that
had remained in contact with them, and had been so basitied to the composition
of shonkinite. In consequence of this the second batch, which formed the syenite
mass, was less or entirely unchanged in composition.

     The peculiar plate-like structure of the peripheral portion, which is erroneously
attributed by the authors to cracking, set up parallel to the isotherms of cooling,
is, in fact, evidence of shearing planes or fluxion structure in a viscous mass the
homogeneity of which was not perfect at the time of its being stretched over the
uprising boss of syenite. The phenomenon is met with in domes of all viscid
 magmas, and is beautifully sho-«n in the island of Basiluzzo ; the writer suggests
that the cleavage of gneiss, forming mantles to granite intrusions, may have also

 so arisen.

      The partial fusion together of the shonkinite and syenite shows that the former
was yet very hot, as indicated by the plasticity that must have existed to allow of

the formation of the concentric shear-planes referred to. Had the shonkinite not

 been to some extent plastic it would have been more fractured, and fragments of it
 would have become enveloped in the syenite.

      The shonkinite, however, was in that state of which the author first showed

 the important bearing in volcanic rocks, and which may conveniently be called

 viscous inertia, in which a viscous body responds instantaneously to a shock as if
 it were a solid. The shonkinite, although plastic, was at such a critical point that
 when it was suddenly stretched out over the back of the new syenite intrusion it

cracked, and, syenite being injected, the white band described by the authors was

mproduced exactly the situation one would have expected to have found it.

     The plate structure of this white band being continuous with that of the in-

closing shonkinite is not an objection to its dyke-like nature, for there are several

ways in which such cleavage may be developed.
    At any rate the presence of this white band is quite inexplicable on the

^segregation' or 'liquation' hypothesis, and is the insurmountable obstacle to
the acceptance of Messrs. Weed's and Pirrsson's generalisations as to magmatic

differentiation.

The following Papers and Reports were read :

%1. The Depths of the Sea in Past Epochs.         E. B. Wethered, i^.6'.,S'.

     The author referred to the teachings of Ilutton that the past history of our
planet is to be explained by what we see going on at the present time. Till the
reports of the 'Challenger' Expedition were publislied our knowledge of the
' depths of the sea ' was very meagre, and the teachings of Hutton could not be
applied for want of this knowledge. After reading the report on ' Deep Sea
Deposits,' by Mr. Murray, it occurred to the author that it would be of interest to
study in detail the ' Depths of the Sea in Past Epochs,' so far as possible, by a
microscopic examination of limestones which contain what is preserved of the

fauna of the sea in which these rocks were formed, and thus to further test the

teachings of Hutton.
     The author has, however, only accomplished a small part of the work indicated,

and in this paper he only gives an outline of his investigations so far done.

referred to the leading fossils, and remarked on the very fragmentary condition of
the calcareous remains which have contributed to the building up of this limestone.

Judging by the high percentage of detrital matter in the rock, in one bed amount-
ing to 30'4 per cent., he thinks that land was not far off, and therefore the shells

and skeletons of marine creatures may have been subjected to the action of waves,

which would account for the fragmentary condition in which they were finally

deposited on the floor of the sea.
     Reference was next made to the work of encrusting organisms which had not

been pointed out prior to the author's researches. In some beds of the Wenlock

Limestone the majority of the organic calcareous fragments are partially or entirely
inclosed by a crust which was the work of the little-understood genus Girvanella.

This organism consists of a minute calcareous tube, as small as '01 of a millim.
in diameter, with well-defined walls. So important has been the work of this
tubular form of life that the crusts produced by the growth and multiplication of
the tubules have in some cases become the chief factor in building up beds of

limestone.

Passing to the Carboniferous period, the author referred to the knoi\"n fact that

moUusca, corals, crinoids, polyzoa, &c., were very numerous in the sea of this epoch,
and their shells and skeletons have contributed to the calcareous deposits which

accumulated on the floor of the Carboniferous sea, which deposits are now known

as the Carboniferous Limestone. It is, however, an error to suppose that the

remains of these creatures were the chief constituents of the calcareous deposits in

the depths of the Carboniferous sea. If the great central mass of the Carboniferoua
Limestone be examined microscopically, it will be found that the tests of micro-

scopic life form the material with which this strata has been built up. Indeed,

microscopic life must have been quite as abundant in Carboniferous waters as it

was in the sea in which the chalk was formed, aud not unlike what we find at the

Wepresent time.  know that the chalk is largely built up of the remains of

Foraminifera, and the calcareous ooze drawn up from the Atlantic has been proved

to be full of the tests of Foraminifera associated with other organisms. This is

deeply interesting, but it is at least equally so to know that in Palseozoic seas the
condition of things was similar. The chalk has been spoken of as the Cretaceous
equivalent of the calcareous ooze drawn up from the Atlantic of to-day, but the
Carboniferous Limestone is very much older chalk.

     Another microscopic form of life which existed in great profusion on the floor
of the Carboniferous sea is the remarkable genus Calcisphmra. It consists of a

hollow calcareous sphere averaging in diameter about "004 of an inch, and when

cut in section has the appearance of a ring. In such numbers did this spherical

object exist that we could scarcely section a small piece of limestone from the

middle series of the Carboniferous Limestone without finding several specimens or
fragments of Calcisphsera.

     The author next referred to the encrusting organisms which lived in the Car-
boniferous sea. The work was similar to that described in the Wenlock sea,
and to such an extent had the encrusting been carried on that some beds of
the Carboniferous Limestone are practically built up of the minute sphericles so
produced. As, too, in the case of the Wenlock sea, the encrusting process was
chiefly done by the genus Girvanella, but there was also another encrusting
organism at this period, namely, the genus Mitcheldeania, which was a more
complicated form of life compared with Girvanella.

      Passing to the Oolitic system of the Jurassic period, the author pointed to
the profusion of marine life which existed, but the point of interest to which he

desired to especially refer was the formation of the oolitic granules, of which these

rocks were chiefly constructed.

    Up to the time of the author's investigations these granules were regarded as

chemical concretions, but in the ' Geological Magazine ' of 1889 he showed that
the larger types of oolitic granules, known as Pisolite, were not concretions but

the work of organisms. He has since been forced to the conclusion that this

organic origin applies to all oolitic granules, large and small.
     The author then referred back to the encrusting processes which took place

on the floor of the Wenlock and Carboniferous seas for the purpose of pointing
out that the granules so formed were really oolitic granules. In the Jurassic
Oolite sea, however, the encrusting organisms had greatly increased, and they
have been the chief builders of the oolitic rocks. The process was briefly this.

    As the fragmental remains of calcareous organisms settled on the floor of the
sea they were seized hold of, so to speak, by the encrusting organisms which
gradually inclosed them. At times nearly every fragment was so captured,
and became the nucleus for the encrusting growth ; in this way the Jurassic

freestones were constructed.
     Further proof of the organic origin of oolitic granules has been produced by

Rathplatz, who has shown that oolitic granules collected on the shores of the
Red Sea and Great Salt Lake are the work of calcareous algse. This again
bears out the truth of Ilutton's statements, that we are to vmderstand the past

by the present.

               2. The Eijjpling of Sand. By Vaughan Cornish.

     The author distinguishes three principal kinds of rippled sand, viz.

                                   1. The Ripple Mark of Sea.
                                    2. The Ripple Mark of Streams.
                                   3. The Ripple Mark of Dunes.

     In (1) symmetrical, knife-edged ridges are built up, owing, as is well known,
to the complete reversal of the current at short intervals, which results in an
effective co-operation of the direct current with the vortex formed in the lee of
projections of the rough surface of the sand. This mechanism in the vertical
plane raises the ridges, and, in plan, extends them laterally, so that the mottled
surface of the initial stage is changed into long lines of parallel ridge and furrow.

     If the direction of the waves changes another set of ridges is formed, and this
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  795

produces polygonal figures. These have an even number of sides, and the sides
are arranged in opposing pairs. This serves to discriminate hexagonal forms due
to fossil ripple mark from Hitchcock's supposed fossil tadpole-nests.

     2. The symmetrical, rounded, ripple-mark of the sandy bottom of a stream is
formed by the alternate acceleration and retardation of current which occurs
wherever the surface of the water is corrugated by a train of standing waves.
This form has been called Ripple Drift. The ridges only travel when the whole
train of water-waves travels ; when the train of waves arises from ^ fixed obstacle
the sand ridges are stationary ; where, however, there is much sedimentation of
floating sand, the weather slope receives most of the sand shower, and the ridges

travel upstream,

    3. The Ripple Mark of Dunes is produced when sand grains roll before the

wind. These ripples are not symmetrical, but they preserve their sectional shape
during their growth, the height and length increasing in the same proportion.

They grow laterally in the same way as (1). They are produced by the steadiest
natural wind, and by a steady artificial blast even the resistance offered by the

sand grains being sufficient to produce in yielding air a periodic motion such as
must be independently produced in water for the formation of the regular ripple
mark of sea or stream. Flying-sand falling upon the surface of a sand-dune blurs
the pattern of the ripples ; but if the shower be not too thick the grains are soon

sorted into position as they roll.

                                    3. Are there Fossil Deserts ?

                     By Professor Dr. Johannes Walther.

     If we accept the postulate of Lyell, that the phenomena of former periods must
be explained by the existing phenomena of our earth, we must look around to find
the regions over which transported material is deposited. It is well known that
on the bottom of the seas and lakes the transporting action comes to an end, and that

no material is carried out of them. Therefore it is the opinion of most geologists
that the greater part of our sedimentary rocks were deposited from water. The

author has spent much time in travelling, for the sake of studying the areas

occupied by deserts, and finds that, besides the old sea and lake bottoms, there is
a large area of no drainage in the existing deserts.

    On our globe there is a harmonious system of climatic zones. The largest of

these is the tropical zone, which forms more than half the surface of the earth.
The smallest area is the polar regions, which contain only one-eighth of the earth's
surface. Between these are intercalated in each hemisphere a temperate zone,

and a zone of desert, arranged quite symmetrically. By the postulate of Lyell we

must believe that similar deserts must have existed in the past. The investigation
of these ancient wastes is a problem not yet worked out.

                4. Notes on the Ancient Bocks of Charnwood Forest.

                         By W. W. Watts, M.A., F.G.S.

   [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

     In the course of the re-survey of sheet 155 for the Geological Survey, the
author was instructed to examine the ancient rocks of Charnwood Forest. The
boundaries dividing these rocks from the Carboniferous, Triassic, and Plutonic

rocks had already been mapped by his colleague Mr. Fox Strangways, who had also
determined with much accuracy the position and general character of all the
exposures of the older rocks. It was merely left to the author to endeavour to

get out the succession and structure of these older rocks.
     The ancient rocks of Charnwood Forest appear in isolated spots, sometimes of

considerable size, through the Trias of the Midland Plain. The oldest rock in
contact with them is the Carboniferous Limestone of Grace Dieu, which is
dolomitised. Evidence as to their exact age cannot, therefore, be obtained from

superposition.

                                                                                            3 f2

     They clearly existed as islands in the Triassic and Carhoniferous seas, and most
probably stood up as mountains on the land in Old Red Sandstone times. The
Trias runs up into the hollows and valleys of the old rocks, and from the small
amount of debris which extends beyond the margins of the masses it is obvious
that the smaller of these at any rate have been uncovered at a time geologically
very recent. Their features are not those of the present day, but date dack partly
to the subaerial denudation of Old Red Sandstone and probably earlier times, and
partly to the aqueous denudation of Carboniferous and Triassic times. This is the
reason for the peculiar character of the surface features presented by the old rock ;
escarpments are practically absent, hard beds are cut oif abruptly, the rocks strike
across the ridges, and the landscape generally is not of the usual subaerial cha-
racter. Present-day denudation, by clearing out the Triassic debris, has done

little more than expose to-day a pre-Triassic landscape.
    The ancient rocks themselves may be classified as follows, in descending

order :

         Swithland and Groby slates .          . -i

         Conglomerate and Quartzite .          . l The Brand series.

         Purple and green beds . . . j

         The olive hornstones of Bradgate

         The Woodhouse beds

         Slate Agglomerate of Roecliffe              The Maplewell series.

         Hornstones of Beacon Hill

         Felsitic Agglomerate

         Rocks of Blackbrook . . . The Blackbrook series.

This general succession corresponds with that made out by Messrs. Hill and

Bonney, with whose observations the author is in substantial agreement.

These divisions sweep round the  semidome, which     is  exposed                                  it  is  elongated
                                                                                               ;

from N.W. to S.E., and broken by several longitudinal faults in the same direction.

Probably there are some cross faults as well.

The succession is most easily made out in the eastern side of the anticline, but

even here the details are very much complicated, and it is not possible to trace

some of the beds for any considerable distance, although the general succession

seems quite clear. As Messrs. Bonney and Hill pointed out, the two agglomerates

form a most useful index, and one which can be traced for a great part of the way

round the Forest. The same may be said of the Beacon Hill beds and of the Brand

series.

     The bulk of the rocks are made of volcanic ingredients, even the fine horn-
stones and slates being made of volcanic dust, interleaved with tuffs and

breccias. When the lower part of the Maplewell series is traced round to the

north-west it becomes coarser, and eventually passes into a mass of very coarse

agglomerates in which the succession is not easy to unravel, while it is much

confused by faulting and the intrusion of igneous rocks, possibly also by the out-

flow of lava.

Bardon Hill presents exceptional difficulties. While the chief rocks are like

those of Grace Dieu, Cademan, and Whitwick, it lies altogether out of the line of

these rocks, and must owe its position to faulting. The agglomerates are also

associated with a mass of porphyroid like that which occurs in a normal position

at Peldar Tor and High Sbarpley. At Bardon this rock appears to be intrusive

into the agglomerates, and a similar explanation may have to be adopted for

Sharpley, Peldar, and Ratchet. Many difficulties would still have to be met, not

the least of which is the occurrence of boulders of Peldar rock in some of the

Aagglomerates.    possible explanation of this is found at High Sharpley, where

porphyroid, which is now acknowledged to be either an intrusion or a lava, is

uodular in structure ; it has been subsequently sheared so as to put on the aspect

of an agglomerate.

The porphyroid would appear to have been the first rock intruded before much

movement had taken place in the rocks : it is sheared, cleaved, and crushed along

the N.W. and S.E. lines.
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                  797

    Syenite was next intruded, generally along the main movement planes such as
faiilta, and the junction of the Brand series with the Maplewell series. It has
been somewhat crushed by the movement, and its main divisional planes agree
with the cleavage and faulting directions in the country.

   A still later intrusion appears to be the Mount Sorrel granite, which does not

penetrate into the Forest proper while it is in contact with rocks whose relation

to the rest of the Forest has not been ascertained with certainty. It is the only
igneous rock which effects any considerable amount of metamorphism in the clastic
rocks with which it is in contact.

     As to the age of the rocks we have little to guide us. They are unlikely to

be later than Cambrian ; they are not at all like the fossiliferous Cambrian rocks
of Nuneaton ; they do not contain Cambrian fossils, nor do the Nuneaton diorites

penetrate them. On the other hand, the movement by which they were affected
came from the direction S.W. to N.E., whilst Lower Silurian and Cambrian rocks

are generally, except at Nuneaton, affected by forces which acted at right angles

to this.

     Professor Lapworth, when with the author in Charnwood, succeeded in finding
a worm burrow in the slates low down in the Brand series, and Mr. Rhodes has
since obtained one or two additional examples ; these are the first undoubted

fossils found in Charnwood.

                             5. The Geology of Skomer Island.

By F. T. Howard, M.A., F.G.S., and E. W. Small, M.A., B.Sc, F.G.S.

--I. Previous Literature. De la Beche (in 'Trans. Geol. Soc.,'2nd series, vol. ii.)

mentions the presence of a ' quartzose and striped cornean,' of ' bedded greenstone,'

and ' massive compact greenstone.' Murchison (Silurian system) gives a section

across part of the island, and indicates the occurrence of Upper Cambrian rocks.

Rutley and Teall have described the microscopic characters of some of the rocks,

but none of these authorities gives exact localities, or describes the relationship of

the different beds.

     II. General Character and Arranffement of the Sedimentari/ and Igneous

--Hocks. The general strike of the beds is more or less east and west, with a
Asoutherly dip.
                     well-marked ridge of felsitic conglomerate running from the

Waywest side of the Wick in an east by north direction to the north of Welsh

serves as a convenient base line ; beneath it are finer conglomerates, sandstones

rich in felspar, and red shales ; above it finer beds occur to the south, faulted
against basalt in the Wick, conformably passing beneath the basalt at High Cliff.

This basalt forms the southern promontory of the island except near the Mewstone,

where quartz grits occur. Beneath the conglomerate, between the Wick and

Tom's House, a very coarse breccia occurs, resting upon and derived from a highly

siliceous banded and spherulitic felsite, which weathers white and shows spherules

up to several inches in diameter. This appears to be the felsite described by
Rutley, and is probably the striped quartzose cornean of De la Beche. In the cove

west of Tom's House a basalt appears to pass quite regularly beneath the felsite.
Massive and thinly bedded basalts follow to the north, but in Pigstone Bay thin

felsites, grits, and shales are seen, and a conglomerate of basalt and felsite frag-

ments resting upon an uneven floor of basalt. The section here shows clearly the
interbedded character of the igneous rocks. North of Bull Hole we meet with

felsite again, which occupies the northernmost part of the island, including the

outlying Garland stone. Some bands of ash are seen in the basaltic cliffs between

the north point of the island and North Castle. Sedimentary grits and shales

occur in North and South Haven, and at the Rye Rocks ; they pass beneath a

basalt which apparently forms all the remaining portion of the Neck.

  --III. Infuence of the Geological Structure on the Physical Features. The two

marked inlets of North and South Haven, as also the channel separating (at high

water) the Mewstone from the main parts of the island, have been formed by the

more rapid erosion of the sedimentary strata, and the Wick has been clearly eaten

Aout along a line of fault between basalt and sedimentary beds.  curious series of
798 EEPORT-- 1 896.

ridges running across the island in a more or less east and west direction mark the
outcrops of massive basalts, felsites, and hard felsitic conglomerates, the lower
ground between them being formed of softer sedimentary strata, or of more thinly

--bedded rocks of basaltic character.
    IV. Age of the Rocks. No fossils have yet been found on Skomer, but along

the south side of the promontory at Wool tack Park, on the mainland, some grits

and shales occur, containing tentaculites, &c., which closely resemble those of

Skomer, and have the same general dip. These beds are mapped by the Survey as
WeLlandeilo, but are probably somewhat later in age.
                                                      are therefore inclined to

regard the corresponding beds on Skomer, with their associated igneous rocks, as

of Bala or Llandovery age.

  --V. Microscopic Characters of the Hocks, (a) Sedimentary. The grits consist

of clear quartz grains, with the angles rounded oft', a felspar weathered beyond

Arecognition, and, rarely, some mica.  granite pebble from the conglomerate
--ridge comes from the same mass as the Brimaston granite, (b) Felsites.

Several of the slides show good flow structure, with phenocrysts of felspar, some-

Atimes largely kaolinised.  section cut from the more coarsely spherulitic part of

the rock to the east of Tom's House shows five well-marked whitish spherules (of

about ^incli diameter) in a greenish granular ground. The spherules are much

cracked, and show dusty brown material in concentric bands towards the edges,

"Under crossed Nicols a well-marked fibrous radiating structure is apparent, but the
crystallisation is somewhat confused, and the spherules do not show a clearly

defined black cross. In two places the slide shows patches of crystalline character,

--which appear to be basaltic inclusions, (c) Basalts and Poephyrites. The

slides cut from specimens obtained from the west side of Tom's House, the cave at

the bottom of the Wick, the west side of South Haven, and fi-om North Castle, all
show porphyritic felspars, often with good crystal outlines, granules of augite, and

much ilmenite or magnetite. The rock from the Neck, opposite Midland Island, is
a porphyrite, showing fine laths of plagioclase felspar, and much black granular

-- --material, probably ilmenite, with no phenocrysts. The Skomer Head rock is a

basalt ophitic in parts -with lath-shaped felspar crystals, much augite (some of

which is quite fresh), magnetite or ilmenite, and greenish decomposition products.

The basalt of the Pigstone Ixock shows good phenocrysts of felspar in a fine-grained
dusty ground-mass ; the augite is small, and mostly altered. The rock seen at the
Table is a porphyritic basalt, with large felspars showing very distinct crystal out-

lines, some olivine, a little augite, and numerous opaque granules of ilmenite.
Some of the basalts {e.ff., that north of Bull Hole) show distinct flow structure,
the small lath-shaped felspars being seen to bend round larger crystals.

6. Jfotes on Sections along the London Extension of the Manchester,

    Sheffield, and Lincoln Railway between Rii^gby and Aylesbury. By

     Horace B. Woodward, F.R.S., F.G.S.

  [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

     Commencing at Willoughby, near Braunston, attention was drawn to cuttings
in the Lower Lias, from the zone of Ammonites artnatus to that of A. capricornus
at Catesby. The Catesby tunnel was excavated partly in the higher beds of
Lower Lias, and partly in the Middle Lias, zone of A. margaritatus. The Marl-
stone rock-bed occurred above the tunnel and was exposed at its southern
entrance. At Charwelton a mass of Upper Lias was let down by a trough-fault
between beds of Middle Lias. Gravel containing pebbles of chalk and derived
Jurassic fossils occurred also at Charwelton. Sections of Upper Lias were noted
at Woodford Halse and Banbury Lane, near Moreton Pinkney.

     Boulder Clay was first encountered south of Woodford Halse, the vale of
Lower Lias not exhibiting any section of it, It covers considerable tracts of th&
higher grounds onwards towards Steeple Claydon, and is an extension of the East
Anglian Chalky Boulder Clay.
----

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  799

      Cuttings near Sulgrave and onwards to Ilelmdon and Brackley showed
fossiliferous marls and limestones of the Great Oolite with underlying Estuarine

Beds.

     At one point east of Hill Farm, south of Radstone, where the Boulder Claj
rested on the marls and limestones of the Great Oolite, streaks of reddish brown

clay were noticed at the hase of the grey Glacial Clay. Elsewhere the Boulder
Clay was seen resting on a piped surface of Great Oolite, the ' pipes ' being filled
with reddish-brown clay. In places the Great Oolite was somewhat disturbed
and nipped up. Evidently the agent which produced the Boulder Clay was
forced over an old land-snrface formed of Great Oolite. That formation was
disturbed in places, and portions of the old soil were stripped off and incorporated
in the Boulder Clay. Further south the Boulder Clay was banked up against a
bed of coarse boulder-gravel, such as is found near Buckingham, near the southern
margin of this Glacial drift.

     In places pebbles from overlying gravel were noticed to occur a foot or two
down in Great Oolite Clay. In dry weather, when clays become deeply fissured,

stones from overlying drift or soil may drop into crevices, and become embedded
in a much older deposit to a depth of four or five feet.

    No cornbrash was shown in any of the cuttings. South-west of Rosehill

Farm, near Chetwode, the Oxford Clay appeared, and it was well seen north-east
of Charndon Lodge Farm, where clays of the zone of Ammonites ornatus were

exposed.

     Near Steeple Claydon a specimen of A. Sutherlandue with A. Lamberti
attached was picked up on the embankment. The fossils were identified by
Mr. G. Sharman.

2. On the Discovery of Marine Shells in the Drift Series at High Levels in
                         Ayrshire, N.B. By John Smith.

    Where best developed the Ayrshire Drift Beds are arranged in the following

order :

     1. Upper Boulder-clay, often with large blocks.
     2. Stratified sand and gravel.

      3. Boulder-clay, blocks generally small.

    4. Gravel, sharp sand, hour-glass sand, and muddy sand.
    5. Laminated mud or clay, sometimes with one or two beds of Boulder-clay.
     6. Lower Boulder-clay, often with large blocks.
    7. Mammoth and Reindeer bed at Kilmaurs.

     In bed No. 1 marine shells occur at 40 and 1,061 ft. above sea-level, and at

many intermediate heights.
     In bed No. 2 I have got marine shells frequently up to a little above 200 ft.

above sea-level, and in one instance at about 800 feet.
     In bed No. 3 marine fossils are frequent up to at least 600 ft. above sea-level.
 800 REPORT--1896.

      In bed No. 5 (laminated mud or clay) I have not yet found any fossils.

       In the lower Boulder -clay (6) marine fossils are occasionally got, but it ia,

 generally speaking, much obscured by talus along the river banks.
      The Boulder-clays in fresh cuttings often look as if they were massive, but

 weathered exposures often show lines of stratification, and sometimes there are
 thin horizontal bands of sand or gravel through them.

      Striated stones are got in them lying beside perfectly unscratched and angular
 stones, and far-travelled stones and boulders are got beside those of the district.

      The Boulder-clays, generally speaking, take their colour from the formations on
 which they rest, or at least from one not far away.

      About the middle of the county some stones and boulders from the north are
 mixed with those from the south.

      At about 700 feet of altitude in certain districts there is no Boulder-clay to be
 seen on top of the sand and gravel, the latter being well bedded and the gravel well

rounded.

     Up to 800 feet in the open country there are many drums of drift, and in the
narrow glens under certain conditions the drums are got up to a much higher alti-

tude, the Boulder-clay reaching to over 1,700 feet, and the sands and gravel inter-
bedded with it to over 1,000 feet.

      In the sand and gravel beds there are occasionally large boulders, as well as in
the laminated mud.

     The interstratified beds are sometimes much contorted
     Under the Boulder-clay the rock is sometimes crushed, the fragments being
often mixed into the bottom of the clay.
     The Boulder-clay appears sometimes to have been dragged a bit, and then the
stones are more intensely striated and the shelly fragments scratched.

      Sometimes the stones are standing on edge in the Boulder-clay.
     The '25 foot ' beach always rises on b. platform cut out by the waves, but the
' 40-foot ' one is sometimes seen resting on drums of Boulder-clay.
     The great bulk of the marine shells occur as fragments, although there are some
very good specimens.

     The fragments are mostly sharp-edged, and many have the epidermis, a few being

scratched and polished.
     The fossils that turn up most frequently are : Astarte compressa, Astarte

sulcata, Cyprina islandica, and Leda pernula.
     The occasional being : Pecten islandicus, Cardium, Natica, Buccinum or Fusus,

Littorina littorea (worn). Plates of Balaui, and burrows of boring sponges. Many

fragments cannot be determined.

    What looks like Melobesia (sticking to stones) has turned up in three localities.

3. Notes 011 the Superficial Deposits of North Shropshire.

                  By C. Callaway, D.Sc, F.G.S.

The author gives a sketch of observations on the sandy and shingly deposits

that he scattered over the plain of North Shropshire. They are found as high as

1,100 feet at Gloppa, while erratics occur on tlie Longmvnd hills as high as

1,050 teet. That the gravels and sands are of marine origin is inferred from their

arrangement, which is similar to that of ordinary littoral deposits, and from their
abundant moll usean fauna, which is entirely marine. Under the former head

attention is called to the frequent occurrence of ripple-marks in the sands, and
under the latter it is remarked that the comminuted condition of many of the

fossils IS to be expected from littoral conditions. It is pointed out that, in the

eastern part of the area, chalk flints are abundant, which is hardly consistent with

a north-western  derivation                                          while the discoverv of a Cornbrash fossil in the sands

at Wellington proves derivation from the east or south. In conclusion, the author
insists upon the decisive fact that the hills and crags of the area do not present the
rounded outlines to be expected in a glaciated district.

                   4. TJie Glacial Phenomena of the Vale of Clwyd.

              By J. LoMAS A.R.C.S., and P. F. Kendall, F.G.S.

     The Vale of C'lwyd is a V-shaped valley running almost N. and S. The floor
is composed of Triassic rocks, while the sides consist of Silurian slates and grits

with faulted inliers of Carboniferous age at intervals along the inner edges.

     The tract of land occupying the mouth of the Vale is low and marshy. As

the solid rock is reached in this district only at a considerable depth below O. D.,

and there are evidences of a pre-Glacial line of cliffs along the neighbouring coasts,

we must regard it as an arm of the sea which has been filled up with drift

deposits.

  . About St. Asaph and southwards the ground rises into mounds which run

nearly parallel to the axis of the Vale. Where gaps appear in the Moel Fammau

range the drift mounds curve round so as to be parallel with the opening.
      Further south, beyond Denbigh, the ground is again flat, and this character con-

tinues to the end of the open part of the Vale.
     The deposits at the north consist of clays and sands with shell fragments

similar to those spread over the plains of Lancashire and Cheshire, and contain

erratics from the N.

     At St. Asaph, Oolwyn, and other places these northern drifts are seen to
overlie an older deposit yielding Welsh erratics exclusively, and containing no

shell fragments.

     The northern drift extends as far as Tremeirchion on the east, and a boulder of
Scotch granite has been found near Denbigh on the west.

     Above Denbigh only Welsh drift is found.
     Near Llanfair the Clwyd leaves the main valley and goes through a gorge con-
tinuing to near Corwen. At PwU-glas, Derwen, Gwyddelwern, and other places the
valley is blocked by mounds of gravel which run athwart the valley. They repre-
sent terminal moraines laid down by a glacier proceeding down the Vale from the
Dee Valley.

  --Sequence of Events. The Welsh hills nursed glaciers during the early part of

the Glacial period. These increased and spread out from Arenig Mawr as a centre.

So great was the ice-spread that boulders were carried over the highest points in

the Moel Fammau and the Mynydd Hiraethog and Cym-y-Brain ranges.

     The ice from Scotland, Lake District, and Ireland, creeping southwards and
filling the shallow Irish Sea, cleaved on reaching the N. Wales massif about the
Gt. Orme's Head.

     So great was the pressure that the Welsh ice was also divided into two streams,
one going west through the Menai Straits and over Anglesey, and the other going
eastwards and joining with the great sheet which swept over Cheshire into the

Midlands.

     Evidence of this cleavage we have in the Glacial striae which are divergent E.

and W. of the Conway and in the character of the boulder transport. The E. side

of the Vale of Clwyd is covered with great deposits of red drift derived from the

floor of the Vale, while the W. side contains no Triassic rocks. Through the

opening about Bodfari enormous masses of red sand were carried, and formed the
well-known deposits of the Wheeler Valley.

    On the dwindling of the ice the valleys still retained small glaciers, the

deposits of one being found in the Upper Clwyd.

     Conclusmis. --The Drift lends no countenance to the theory that this portion

of North Wales was submerged during the Glacial period. In fact the absence of
northern Drift with shells in places at a level below the shell-bearing beds on each

side directly contradicts the assumption.

 5, On some Post-Pliocene Changes of Physical Geography in Yorkshire.
                           By Percy F. Kendall, F.G.S.

     The drift deposits of Yorkshire are extensively developed over all the low
grounds and in much of the hill country. They have been attributed by the
802 REPORT-- 1896.

officers of the Geological Survey, the late Professor Carvill Lewis, Mr. Lamplugh,
and other geologists, to the action of glaciers descending all the principal valleys,
from Teesdale on the north to Airedale on the south, with a great main stream
occupying the Vale of York almost as far as the Humber, and a Scandinavian
ice-sheet abutting against the whole coast-line.

      Pre-Glacial valleys have been detected beneath the drift at depths exceeding
170 feet below O.D.

    The irregular accumulation of the glacial deposits produced many changes in

the courses of the rivers, and a great area was added to the coast -line.
     The Denvent has been shown by Mr. Fox Strangways to have reversed its

flow, and instead of discharging into Filey Bay, it now flows westward, passes
through the Howardian Hills in a narrow gorge 150 feet deep, and ultimately
joins the Ouse. The change of direction has been ascribed to the formation of a

ridge of boulder-clay, which extends across the valley behind Filey, and has a

minimum altitude of 130 feet, which is only 70 feet below the top of the notch iu
the Howardian Hills. The author considers it more pro)Dable that the diversion
was effected by an ice-barrier. At one stage a lake would be formed occupying

the whole Vale of Pickering, and lacustrine deposits are found, having a thick-
ness of over 90 feet.

     The river system of the Vale of York is very peculiar. The Tees crosses a very
broad tract of soft rocks without receiving a single tributary from the south. The
Wiske rises in the north-western corner of the Cleveland Hills, and approaches
within two miles of the Tees, then turns south and joins the Swale.

     The Drift is very deep along the line of the Tees, and thins to the south, so
that the solid rocks are exposed at many places along a line running through
Northallerton and Bedale. This was the pre-Glacial Watershed. Northward of
it the Drift is mainly boulder-clay, while southward gravels largely predominate

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

exactly the same fact is observed south of the watershed between the Mersey and

the Severn.

     The Swnle and Wiske were formerly tributaries of the Tees.

    No study has yet been made of the Ure.

     The Nidd furnishes an example of a diversion difi'erent from any yet noted.

Down to Ripley it flows through a wide and open valley, but below that village it

enters a narrow and deep gorge or ravine cut partly through grits and shales of
the Millstone Grit series, and partly through Magnesian Limestone. For long
distances its banks are extremely steep, and in places, as at Knaresborough and
Plumpton, even vertical, producing scenery unrivalled in any part of Yorkshire.
This is obviously so recent a channel that the author was impelled to seek an
older one, and discover the cause of its abandonment. Such an old valley is
clearly traceable from Ripley, past Nidd Hall and Brearton, out into the Vale of
York. It is broad and well defined, and its sides have a very gentle slope, like
those of the upper part of the vallej^, and there are extensive marshy patches in its

course. Near Nidd Hall a large lateral moraine of a glacier, which came down
Uredale, obstructs the old valley. Many excavations display the usual structure

of moraines.

     The Wharfe presents similar features to those of the Nidd. Its valley is wide
and open until the town of AVetherby is reached ; then the river, instead of pur-

suing a north-easterly course through a valley extending through the town,
turns abruptly to the south-east, and runs through a gorge in the Magnesian

Limestone down to Tadcaster. The valley across the site of Wetherby is filled
with a great thickness of excessively coarse morainic gravel, thrown down by the
side of the same glacier as that which deflected the Nidd, and it seems probable

that this also is a case of diversion.

   --There are numerous small diversions of the Aire by terminal moraines for
--example, near Keighley and Bingley but its lower course appears quite normal.

      Great changes have been wrought in the upper part of the Calderdale by the
events of the Glacial period, but they and the remarkable vicissitudes of the
Trent will be dealt with in a future communication.

           7. Another Possible Cause of the Glacial Epoch.

        By Professor Edward Hull, LL.D., F.E.S., F.G.S.

W.The author gave an account of the results arrived at by Professor J.

Spencer, Ph.D., in his memoir on ' The Reconstruction of the Antillaean Continent

(' Bull. Geol. Soc.,' America, January 1895) from observations laid down on the

Admiralty charts of the east coast of North America and the shores of the West
Indian Islands and Gulf of Mexico. He shows that the 'continental shelf lying

between the coast and the 100-fathom line is succeeded by a second and deeper

plateau, called by Professor A. Agassiz ' the Blake plateau,' the average depth of

which may be taken at 2,700 feet, separated from the continental shelf by a steep

descent, and in its turn bounded by a second steep descent leading down to the

abysmal depths of the Atlantic Ocean at 12,000 or 13,000 feet below the surface.

A careful investigation of the soundings shows that these plateaus are traversed

by channels, sometimes of great depth and with precipitous sides, leading down

from the embouchures of the existing rivers which open out on the coast, and con-
nected with the outer margins of the plateaus by wide embayments. The form of
these channels would in some cases entitle them to be called ' canons ' or ' fjords '

and, as Professor Spencer truly considers that such channels could only be formed

by river erosion, he concludes that the whole eastern coast and the West Indian

Isles were elevated to the extent of the outer embayments where they open out on

the floor of the ocean. Such an elevation of 12,000 feet or so would have con-
nected North and South America along the line of the Antilles, constituting a

single continent,! and are termed * stupendous changes of level ' of the Pleistocene

epoch.

     The author of this paper proceeds to discuss some of the climatic conditions which
would result from such changes, and supposes that the elevation of the Antillaean

continent would have shut out the northern branch of the great equatorial current

known as the Gulf Stream from the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, causing

it to enter the North Atlantic  directly                                 and he comes to the conclusion  that  the
                                                                      ;

Atlantic current would have crossed the 40th parallel with surface temperature of

only 74° F., instead of 84° F., as is the case at the present day. The author then

discusses the question to what extent such a lowering of the temperature of the

present Gulf Stream would have affected the climate of the regions bordering the

North Atlantic, and considers that this effect may be approximately arrived at by

transferring the climatic conditions of the isotherm of annual mean temperature of

30° F. (the freezing point of water) to those of the 42° F. of the present day,

resulting in sub-glacial conditions along the line of this isotherm.

Proceeding next to examine the effects of the elevation of the American con-

tinent to the extent required by Professor Spencer's conclusions, the author

considers it as extremely probable that the cold produced by this physical change,
added to that due to the lowering of the temperature of the Atlantic current,
would result in bringing about the conditions of the Glacial epoch ; and as similar

elevation of land has been determined in the case of the platform of the British

--Isles and North-western Europe though to a much smaller extent than in the
--case of the American continent the increased cold due to this cause, added to that

due to the diminished temperature of the Atlantic current, would have been, if not
a vera causa of the Glacial epoch of Europe, a most material cause in bringing
about the chmatic conditions of that epoch.

5. Fifth Contribution to Rhmtic Literature.

   By Montagu Browne, F.G.S., F.Z.S.

The Rhatic Bone-bed of Aust Clijff, and the Rock-bed above it.

The RhfBtic bone-bed of Aust Clifl" seldom yields perfect examples of vertebrate

Anremains, and still more rarely, if ever, objects in association.  examination of

the rock shows the reason for this. It is made up largely of sub-angular frag-

ments or rolled boulders of the Keuper sandstone to be found immediately below

it, around which are sands, probably of Keuper age, so arranged, and so highly

charged with fragmentary remains of Rhjetic vertebrata and their excretse, as to

denote currents of considerable turbulence, such as now obtain in seas or estuaries

of no great depth.

Of quite a different character are the black shales above, and the bed of stone

resting thereupon. This band of stone, which has been described by Wright, and

is known as the Pullastra arenicola bed, shows it to have been much more quietly

deposited, and it is in this that bones are more likely to be found in association at
Aust and Westbury-on-Severn. This band of stone is the so-called bone-bed of

the ' Garden Cliff,' Westbury-on-Severn, of Penarth, Lavernock, and Watchet,

the true bone-bed of Aust not being represented at those places, or if at Lavernock

in a very attenuated form. Neither at Pylle Hill, Bristol, nor at the Spinney

Hills, nor at Wigston, Leicester, nor at Walton, Ijeicestershire, nor in the Notting-

hamshire Rhsetics does a bone-bed exist of the same character as that at Aust

the bone-bed of the Spinney Hills, though not of like extent, is on the same

horizon, and contains specimens in the same state of mineralisation as at Aust

Cliff. Another point which lends colour to this theory of partial similitude is that

in both Aust and the Spinney Hill bone-bed remains of Ceratodug have been

found, which have not yet been obtained in the lower Pullastra arenicola or

Isodonta Ewaldi beds.

It is therefore in the first band of stone containing these invertebrate fossils,

and which 7iever lies immediately upon the ' tea-green marls,' that the most perfect
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  805

remains of the lesser Dinosauria, Labyrinthodontia, and of other vertebrata must
be sought, and from this bed at Aust was procured the fine jaw with teeth of
Sauriddhys described by Mr. A. Smith Woodward, and several unusually perfect

specimens obtained by the writer at Aust Cliff and Westbury-on-Severn.

       The ffenus Sphenonchus, i.e., Head-defences of certain Hybodont Sharks.
                                       Sphenonchus hamatus, Af/assiz.

     This species, already recorded in Britain from the Lias, has now been discovered
by the author in the Ehietic bone-bed of Aust Clift". Other specimens examined
by him were collected by Mr. Storrie from the Lavernock bone-bed, and by Mr. T.
Burrows in the bone-bed of the Spinney Hills.

       6. On the Skull of the South African Fossil Reptile Diademodon.
 By H. G. Seeley, F.R.S., Professor of Geology in Kings College, London.

       Only two or three teeth have hitherto been known. The crowns are of
 mammalian type, and although referred to the Gomphodont division of the
 Theriodontia, no proof of the structure of the skull has been previously available.
 The skull now described was found at Wonderboom by Dr. Kannemeyer. It
 gives evidence of ten premolar and molar teeth, of which four are counted as
 premolars and six as molars. The molar teeth are transverse, with a type of
 crown which closely resembles Diademodon Brownii. The last molar is small
 with a narrow posterior talon. The skull is fractured, so that the cerebral region
 is lost, and the snout is lost by a vertical fracture, which passes through the hemi-
 spherical pits upon the pre-orbital angle at the junction of the frontal nasal and
 maxillary bones ; so that the canine teeth are not preserved. The author described
 the limits of the pre-frontal and post-frontal bones, and states that the post-frontal
 diifers from that of Ornithorhynchus in its difierent relation to the small brain
 cavity, and in contributing to form the circular orbit of the eye.

                   7. Note on examples of Current Bedding in Clays.

 By H. G. Seeley, F.R.S., Professor of Geology in King's College, London.

      The author remarked that, although thin layers are defined by differences of
colour in some slates, it is rare for bedding in the great clays to be marked unless

by changes in mineral character. He has observed current bedding in the mottled

clays of the "Woolwich and Reading beds, and in Wealden purple clays near
Tunbridge Wells.

      About two years since current bedding was uncovered in Messrs. Poulton"s pit
in the Reading beds at Katesgrove, near Reading. Above the current bedded
sand, with bands of pipe-clay and fossil leaves, which occur towards the base of
the deposit, crimson and green clays occurred in regular alternations of about
twenty thin beds, which thickened from the west to the east. They were laid
down in the usual curved succession of thin layers horizontally truncated above
by the rapidity of flow of the current. The layers thickened to the west, beyond
 the sheltering bank of the deposits. Each of these beds, which was only two to
four inches thick in the western corner of the pit in which the current bedding is

seen, spreads over the pit as one of the nearly horizontal layers of mottled clav,

which ibrm the part of the section between the yellow sands below and the brown
clay above with marine fossils. There is no evidence of the laminated structure
being due to sand, but a few small irregular calcareous concretions, about an inch
or two in diameter, occur in the beds of green colour.

     The second example was first observed by the Rev. T. R. R. Stebbing, F.R.S.
at the new Recreation Ground, Tunbridge Wells, and at his request the author
examined the section. The deposit is a purple clay of Wealden age, and either
Weald Clay or a subordinate deposit in the Tunbridge AVells sand. It has at first
806 REPORT-- 1896.

the aspect of a boulder clay with bedding inclined to the east. Every layer, in the
thickness exposed of 14 feet, is full of fragments of yellow sandstone, all apparently
derived from one deposit, such as the Ashdown sand. They are all angular, and
vary in size from one inch to two feet in length. There is no trace of smoothing ob
grooving on any of the large number of fragments examined, and therefore no
ground for attributing their transport to ice. The volume of water which

would eifect transport of such a thickness of clay may have been merely the
result of exceptionally heavy rain, for the large fragments appear to be torn away

by their natural joints and bedding planes, and the small fragments are such as the
action of varying temperature would produce in a terrestrial surface. The angle
of dip was about 15°. Mr. F. G. Smart, M.A., F.L.S., of Tunbridge Wells, photo^

graphed the sections at the author's request.
     It is remarked that, although alternating green and red clays in geological

deposits are generally of freshwater origin, there is a similar alternation in some

of the old Cambrian slates.

8. On some Crush-CoTiglomerates in Anglesey.
       By Sir Archibald Geikie, F.R.S.

The important observations made by Mr. Lamplugh among the ' crush-

conglomerates ' of the Isle of Man suggest that the phenomena described by him

may have a much wider range than had previously been supposed. Ever since the

author had the opportunity of going over the Manx evidence with him, he has sus-

pected that some of the fragmental rocks which he has himself regarded as volcanic

agglomerates might prove to be due, not to volcanic explosions, but to the same

kind of underground movements which have undoubtedly given rise to the enor-

mous masses of ' crush-conglomerate ' in the Isle of Man. The breccias of Anglesey

seemed to the author likely, on renewed examination, to prove to belong to the

latter series. Accordingly he recently took occasion to revisit these rocks, both in

the centre and along the north coast of the island. The result was entirely con-

firmatory of his suspicions. The breccias in question are, he now feels convinced,

true crush conglomerates.

The amount of mechanical deformation which these rocks have undergone is

one of their most obvious characteristics. On the supposition of their volcanic

origin, it was quite conceivable that coarse agglomerates and volcanic breccias

might undergo crushing together with the sedimentary series to which they

belonged, so that the evidence of deformation formed is itself no proof that they

were not of pyroclastic derivation. But more detailed investigation, in the light

of the Manx examples, brings to view proofs that the conglomeratic structure has been

produced by the breaking up of stratified rocks in situ. At Llangefni, for example,

the strata affected appear to have been originally shales or mudstones (with possibly

some fine felsitic tuffs), alternating with bands of hard siliceous grit. They have

been crumpled up and crushed into fragments, which have been driven past each

other along the planes of movement. Every stage may be traced, from a long piece

of one of the grit-bands down to mere rounded and isolated pebbles of the same

material. The grits, being much more resisting, have withstood the deformation

better than the argillaceous strata, which have been crushed into a kind of broken

slate or phyllite. Everywhere the signs of movement, or ' flow-structure,' meet

the eye. It is not that the rocks have been merely crushed to fragments ; the

differential movements which produced the ruptures also made the materials to

flow onwards, the dislocated bands of grit being reduced to separate blocks and

pebbles entirely surrounded in the moving matrix of finer shaly paste.

The * agglomerates ' on the coast near Cemmaes, so singularly deceptive as to

be easily mistaken for volcanic necks, prove to be capable of a like interpretation.

The huge blocks of limestone there to be seen, isolated among fragmentary grits

and slates, are referable to the disruption of some of the limestone bands which
Aoccur abundantly in the neighbourhood.
                                         gradation may be traced from the

slates and grits outside the areas of more severe dislocation into the intensely

crushed and sheared 'agglomerate.' The dykes which cut through these rocks
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  807

and increase the likeness to true Tolcanic vents are later than the period of

crushing, and may be traced in the surrounding slates and grits.

     But though the volcanic nature of the rocks formerly believed to be agglome-
rates must be abandoned, the question of the original formation of the strata which
have been so greatly ruptured remains quite distinct. The author agrees with
Mr. Blake in regarding these strata as largely composed of volcanic detritus. The
breccias and fine tuffs which alternate with and overlie the Lower Silurian black

shales can be traced upward into the mass of the Amlwch slates, which are full of
volcanic dust. The evidence for the existence of Lower Silurian volcanoes in the
north of Anglesey remains quite valid and ample, though we must abandon the

volcanic origin of the * agglomerates ' which seemed to form part of that evidence.
The crush-conglomerates have involved the volcanic as well as the non-volcanic
parts of the series in the same destruction. But it is obvious that in a region
which has undergone such severe compression and disruption it cannot be always
an easy task to distinguish between breccias due to original volcanic explosions
and those produced among these very volcanic rocks by subsequent mechanical

stresses.

                         By A. C. Sewaed, M.A., F.G.S.

     The author has recently had an opportunity, through the kindness of Mr. David
Draper, F.G.S., of examining a collection of fossil plants from a locality a short
distance south of Johannesburg. The collection forwarded to England by Mr.
Draper includes examples of Glossopteris, Vertebraria, and other genera, asso-
ciated with specimens of Lepidophloios The occurrence of Lepidodendrons
in strata containing typical members of the Glossopteris flora is extremely
important from the point of view of the geological and geographical distribution of
fossil plants, and specially interesting in connection with a similar association lately
recorded by Professor Zeiller in Brazilian plant-hearing beds. In South Africa, as

in South America, we have evidence of the existence of a plant genus characteristic

of the Upper Paleozoic flora of the northern hemisphere, in the same region with
the Permo-Carboniferous Glossopteris flora.

     11. On the Production of Corundtim by Contact Metamorphism on
                       Dartmoor. By Professor Karl Busz.

     At South Brent the valley of the Avon cuts right through the contact-zone of
the Dartmoor granite. The clay-slate is altered into chiastolite slate and spotted

mica schist, and small interbedded seams of limestone are represented by aggregates
of garnet, malacolite, axinite, and what seems to be anorthite. The crystals of
 andalusite in one of the altered slates have proved to contain a small quantity of
cassitorite in minute crystals. This stream also exposes the intimate contact
 between a felspar porphyry and clay-slate : irregular pieces of the latter rock are
included in the former. Around these pieces there occurred a large number of

minute colourless hexagonal crystals, which, when isolated by the action of hydro-

 fluoric and hydrochloric acids, proved to consist of alumina with a very little iron
oxide. Their hardness was also greater than that of topaz, so that it is clear they
 must consist of corundum. In the opinion of the author the melted porphyry has
 dissolved the clay, and thus become supersaturated with alumina, which has
crystallised out as crystalline corundrum.

                            Section D.--ZOOLOGY.

Pkesident of the Section--E. B. Poulton, M.A., F.R.S., F.L.S., Professor of

                                     Zoology in the University of Oxford.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.

The President delivered the following Address :

 A Naturalist's Contribution to the Discussion upon the Age of

                                             THE Earth.

A VERT brief study of the proceedings of this Section in bygone years will show

that Presidents have exercised a very wide choice in the selection of subjects. At

the last Meeting of the Association in this city in 1870 the Biological Section had as

its President the late Professor Rolleston, a man whose remarkable persouality
made a deep impression upon all who came under his influence, as I have the
strono-est reason for remembering, inasmuch as he was my first teacher in zoology,

fand attended his lectures when but little over seventeen. His address was most

characteristic, glancing over a great variety of subjects, literary as well as scientific,
Aand abounding in quotations from several languages, living and dead.
                                                                       very

different style of address was that delivered by the distinguished zoologist who

presided over the Meeting. Professor Huxley took as his subject ' The Histoiy of

the Rise and Progress of a Single Biological Doctrine.'

myi these two types I selected the latter as  example, and especially desired

to attempt the discussion, however inadequate, of some difficulty which confronts

the zoologist at the very outset when he begins to reason from the facts around
]iim a difficulty which' is equally obvious and of equal moment to the highly

trained investigator and the man who is keenly interested in the results obtained

by others, but cannot himself lay claim to the position and authority of a skilled

observer to the naturalist and to one who follows some other branch of know-

ledge, but is interested in the progress of a sister science.

Two such difficulties were alluded to by Lord Salisbury, in his interesting presi-
dential address to the British Association at Oxford in 1894, when he spoke of

--' two of the strongest objections to the Darwinian explanation' of evolution viz.,

the theory of natural selection--as appearing ' still to retain all their force.' The

first of these objections was the insufficiency of the time during which the earth
has been in a habitable state, as calculated by Lord Kelvin and Professor Tait,

100 million years being conceded by the former, but only ten million by the latter.

Lord Salisbury quite rightly stated that for the evolution of the organic world as
we know it by the slow process of natural selection at least many hundred

million years are required ; whereas, ' if the mathematicians are right, the biologists

cannot have what they demand. . . . The jelly-fish would have been dissipated in

steam long before he had had a chance of displaying the advantageous variation
which was to make him the ancestor of the human race.'

The second objection was that ' we cannot demonstrate the process of natural

selection in detail ; we cannot even, with more or less ease, imagine it.' ' In

natural selection who is to supply the breeder's place ? ' ' There would be nothing
                                                                        --a'

but mere chance to secure that the advantageously varied bridegroom at one end

of the wood should meet the bride, who by a happy contingency had been advan-

tageously varied in the same direction at the same time at the other end of the

--wood. It would be a mere chance if they ever knew of each other's existence

still more unlikely chance that they should resist on both sides all temptations to
a less advantageous alliance. But unless they did so the new breed would never
even begin, let alone the question of its perpetuation after it had begun.'

      Professor Huxley, in seconding the vote of thanks to the President, said that

he could imagine that certain parts of the address might raise a very good dis-

cussion in one of the Sections, and I have little doubt that he referred to these

criticisms and to this Section. When I had to face the duty of preparing this

address, I could find no subjects better than those provided by Lord Salisbury.

     At first the second objection seemed to offer the more attractive subject. It

was clear that the theory of natural selection as held by Darwin was misconceived
by the speaker, and that the criticism was ill-aimed. Darwin and Wallace, from the
very first, considered that the minute differences which separate individuals were
of far more importance than the large single variations which occasionally arise
Lord Salisbury's advantageously varied bride and bridegroom at opposite ends of the
wood. In fact, after Fleeming Jenkins's criticisms in the ' North British Review
for June 1867, Darwin abandoned these large single variations altogether. Thus

he wrote in a letter to W^allace (February 2, 1869) : ' I always thought individual
differences more important ; but I was blind, and thought single variations might

be preserved much oftener than I now see is possible or probable. I mentioned
this in my former note merely because I believed that you had come to a similar
conclusion, and I like much to be in accord with you.' ^ Hence we may infer that

the other great discoverer of natural selection had come to the same conclusion at
an even earlier date. But this fact removes the whole point from the criticism

I have just quoted. According to the Darwin-W^allace theory of natural selection,

individuals sufficiently advantageously varied to become the material for a fresh
advance when an advance became necessary, and at other times sufficient to main-

--tain the ground previously gained such individuals existed not only at the

opposite ends of the wood, but were common enough in every colony within its
confines. The mere fact that an individual had been able to reach the con-
dition of a possible bride or bridegroom would count for much. Few will dispute-
that such individuals ' have already successfully run the gauntlet of by far the
greatest dangers which beset the higher animals [and, it may be added, the lower

--animals also] the dangers of youth. Natural selection has already pronounced a

satisfactory verdict upon the vast majority of animals which have reached

maturity.' *

    But the criticism retains much force when applied to another theory of evolution
by the selection of large and conspicuous variations, a theory which certain writers
have all along sought to add to or substitute for that of Darwin. Thus Huxley
from the very first considered that Darwin had burdened himself unnecessarily in
rejecting per saltum evolution so unreservedly.^ And recently this view has been
revived by Bateson's work on variation and by the writings of Francis Galton. I

had at first intended to attempt a discussion of this view, together with Lord

Salisbury's and other objections which may be urged against it ; but the more the

two were considered, the more pressing became the claims of the criticism alluded

--to at first the argument that the history of our planet does not allow sufficient

time for a process which all its advocates admit to be extremely slow in its

operation. I select this subject because of its transcendent importance in relation

to organic evolution, and because I hope to show that the naturalist has something
of weight to contribute to the controversy which has been waged intermittently
ever since Lord Kelvin's paper 'On Geological Time'* appeared in 1868. It has
been urged by the great worker and teacher who occupied the Presidential Chair

810 REPORT--1896.

of this Association wlien it last met in tliis city that biologists have no right to
take part in this discussion. In his Anniversary Address to the Geological So-
ciety in 1869 Huxley said : ' Biology takes her time from geology. ... If the
geological clock is wrong, all the naturalist will have to do is to modify his
notions of the rapidity of change accordingly.' This contention is obviously true
as regards the time which has elapsed since the earliest fossiliferous rocks were laid
down. For the duration of the three great periods we must look to the geologist
but the question as to whether the whole of organic evolution is comprised within
these limits, or, if not, what proportion of it is so contained, is a question for the
naturalist. The naturalist alone can tell the geologist whether his estimate is suffi-
cient, or whether it must be multiplied by a small or by some unknown but cer-
tainly high figure, in order to account for the evolution of the earliest forms of
life known in the rocks. This, I submit, is a most important contribution to the

discussion.

      Before proceeding further it is right to point out that obviously these argu-

ments will have no weight with those who do not believe that evolution is a
reality. But although the causes of evolution are greatly debated, it may be
assumed that there is no perceptible difference of opinion as to evolution itself, and
this common ground will bear the weight of all the zoological arguments we shall

consider to-day.

It will be of interest to consider first how the matter presented itself to

naturalists before the beginning of this controversy on the age of the habitable

earth. I will content myself with quotations from three great writers on biological

--problems men of extremely different types of mind, who yet agreed in their

conclusions on this subject.

In the original edition of the * Origin of Species ' (1859), Darwin, arguing from

the presence of trilobites, Nautilus, Lingula, &c., in the earliest fossiliferous rocks,

comes to the following conclusion (pages 306, 307) : ' Consequently, if my theory

be true, it is indisputable that before the lowest Silurian stratum was deposited

long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval

from the Silurian age to the present day ; and that during these vast yet quite

unknown periods of time the world swarmed with living creatures.'

The depth of his conviction in the validity of this conclusion is seen in the fact

that the passage remains substantially the same in later editions, in which, how-

ever, Cambrian is substituted for Silurian, while the words 'yet quite unknown'
are omitted, as a concession, no doubt, to Lord Kelvin's calculations, which he

then proceeds to discuss, admitting as possible a more rapid change in organic life,

induced by more violent physical changes.'

   We know, however, that such concessions troubled him much, and that he

was really giving up what his judgment still approved. Thus he wrote to

Wallace on Apriri4, 1869 : ' Thomson's views of the recent age of the world have

mybeen for some time one of         sorest troubles. . . .' And again, on July 12,

1871, alluding to Mivart's criticisms, he says: 'I can say nothing more about

missing links than what I have said.  I  should  rely much on  pre-Silurian  times
                                                                                                     ;

but then comes Sir W. Thomson, like an odious spectre.'

Huxley's demands for time in order to account for pre-Oambrian evolution, as

he conceived it, were far more extensive. Although in 1869 he bade the

naturalist stand aside and take no part in the controversy, he had nevertheless

spoken as a naturalist in 1862, when, at the close of another Anniversary Address
to the same Society, he argued from the prevalence of persistent types ' that any

admissible hypothesis of progressive modification must be compatible with per-

sistence without progression through indefinite periods ; and then maintained
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           '

     Herbert Spencer, in his article on Illogical Geology in the 'Universal
Review ' for July 1859,^ uses these words : ' Only the last chapter of the earth's

history has come down to us. The many previous chapters, stretching back to a
time immeasurably remote, have been burnt, and with them all the records of life
we may presume they contained.' Indeed, so brief and unimportant does Herbert

Spencer consider this last chapter to have been that be is puzzled to account for

' such evidences of progression as exist ; and finally concludes that they are of no
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     '

significance in relation to the doctrine of evolution, but probably represent the

succession of forms by which a newly upheaved land would be peopled. He

argues that the earliest immigrants would be the lower forms of animal and
vegetable life, and that these would be followed by an irregular succession of
higher and higher forms, which ' would thus simulate the succession presented by

our own sedimentary series.'

   We see, then, what these three great writers on evolution thought on this

subject: they were all convinced that the time during which the geologists con-
cluded that the fossiliferous rocks had been formed was utterly insuMcient to

account for organic evolution.

     Our object to-day is first to consider the objections raised by physicists against

the time demanded by the geologist, and still more against its multiplication by

the  student of  organic  evolution                                               secondly, to inquire whether  the  present  state

--of palreontologieal and zoological knowledge increases or diminishes the weight of

the threefold opinion quoted above an opinion formed on far more slender

evidence than that which is now available. And if we find this opinion sustained,

it must be considered to have a very important bearing upon the controversy.

     The arguments of the physicists are three :

     First, the argument from the observed secular change in the length of the day

the most important element of which is due to tidal retardation. It has been

known for a very long time that the tides are slowly increasing the length of our

day. Huxley explains the i-eason with his usual lucidity : ' That this must be so

is obvious, if one considers, roughly, that the tides result from the pull which

the sun and the moon exert upon the sea, causing it to act as a sort of break upon

the solid earth.' -

   A liquid earth takes a shape which follows from its rate of revolution, and

from which, therefore, its rate of revolution can be calculated.

     The liquid earth consolidated in the form it last assumed, and this shape has

persisted until now, and informs us of the rate of revolution at the time of con-

solidation. Comparing this with the present rate, and knowing the amount of

lengthening in a given time due to tidal friction, we can calculate the date of

consolidation as certainly less than 1000 million years ago.

     This argument is fallacious, as many mathematicians have shown. The present

shape tells us nothing of  the  length of                                         the  day  at  the  date of    consolidation                                                     for
                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the earth, even when solid, will alter its form when exposed for a long time to the

action of great forces. As Professor Perry said in a letter to Professor Tait : *
' I know that solid rock is not like cobbler's wax, but 1000 million years is a very
long time, and the forces are great.' Furthermore, we know that the earth is always

altering its shape, and that whole coast-lines are slowly rising or falling, and that

this has been true, at any rate, during the formation of the stratified rocks.

     WeThis argument is dead and gone. '                                          are, indeed, tempted to wonder that the

physicist, who was looking ahout for arguments hy which to revise what he con-

ceived to be the hasty conclusions of the geologist as to the age of the earth,

should have exposed himself to such an obvious retort in basing his own con-
clusions as to its age on the assumption that the earth, which we know to be
always changing in shape, has been unable to alter its equatorial radius by a few

miles under the action of tremendous forces constant!}' tending to alter it, and
bavin? 1000 million years iu which to do the work.

     With this flaw in the case it is hardly necessary to insist on our great uncer-

tainty as to the rate at which the tides are lengthening the day.
     The spectacle presented by the geologist and biologist, deeply shocked at

Lord Kelvin's extreme uniformitarianism in the domain of astronomy and cosmic
physics, is altogether too comforting to be passed by without remark ; but in thus

indulging in a friendly Ui quoqiie I am quite sure that I am speaking for every
member of this Section in saying that we are in no way behind the members of

ASection in our pride and admiration at the noble work which he has done for

science, and we are glad to take this opportunity of congratulating him on the

-- --half-century of work and teaching both equally fruitful which has reached its

completion in the present year.

     The second argument is based upon the cooling of the earth, and this is the
one brought forward and explained by Lord Salisbury in his Presidentiiil Address.
It has been the argument on which perhaps the chief reliance has been placed, and

-- --of which the data so it was believed were the least open to doubt.

     On the Sunday during the meeting of the British Association at Leeds (1800>

I went for a walk with Professor Perry, and asked him to explain the physical
reasons for limiting the age of the earth to a period which the students of other

sciences considered to be very inadequate. He gave me an account of the data

on which Lord Kelvin relied in constructing this second argument, and expressed
the strong opinion that they were perfectly sound, while, as for the mathematics,

it might be taken for granted, he said, that they were entirely correct. He did

not attach much weight to the other arguments, which he regarded as merely

offering support to the second.
      This little piece of personal history is of interest, inasmuch as Professor Perry

has now provided us with a satisfactory answer to the line of reasoning which so
fully satisfied him iu 1890. And he was led to a critical examination of the sub-
ject by the attitude taken up by Lord Salisbury in 1894, Professor Perry was
not present at the meeting, but when he read the President's address, and saw
how other conclusions were ruled out of court, how the only theory of evolution
which commands anything approaching universal assent was set on one side
because of certain assumptions as to the way in which the earth was believed to
have cooled, he was seized with a desire to sift these assumptions, and to inquire

whether they would bear the weight of such far-reaching conclusions. Before
giving the results of his examination, it is necessary to give a brief account of the
argument on which so much has been btiilt.

      Lord Kelvin assumed that the earth is a homogeneous mass of rock similar to

that with which we are familiar on the surface. Assuming, further, that the tem-

perature increases, on the average, 1° F. for every 50 feet of depth near the
surface everywhere, he concluded that the earth would have occupied not less
than twenty, nor more than four hundred, million years in reaching its present

condition from the time when it first began to consolidate and possessed a uniform

temperature of 7000° F.

     If, in the statement of the argument, we substitute for the assumption of a

homogeneous earth an earth which conducts heat better internally than it does
toward the surface. Professor Perry, whose calculations have been verified by Mr.
O. Heaviside, finds that the time of cooling has to be lengthened to an extent
which depends upon the value assigned to the internal conducting power. If,

for instance, we assume that the deeper part of the earth conducts ten times as
well as the outer part, Lord Kelvin's age would require to be multiplied by 56.
Even if the conductivity be the same throughout, the increase of density in the
                                                                                                           ·

deeper part, by augmenting the capacity for heat of unit volume, implies a longer
age than that conceded by Lord Kelvin. If the interior of the earth be fluid or
contain fluid in a honeycomb structure, the rate at which heat can travel would
be immensely increased by convection currents, and the age would have to be

correspondingly lengthened. If, furthermore, such conditions, although not

obtaining now, did obtain in past times, they will have operated in the same

direction.

     Professor Tait, in his letter to Professor Perry (published in ' Nature ' of
January 3, 1895), takes the entirely indefensible position that the latter is bound
to prove the higher internal conductivity. The obligation is all on the other side,

and rests with those who have pressed their conclusions hard and carried them

far. These conclusions have been, as Darwin found them, one of our ' sorest
troubles '; but when it is admitted that there is just as much to be said for another

set of assumptions leading to entirely different conclusions, our troubles are at an

end, and we cease to be terrified by an array of symbols, however unintelligible to

us. It would seem that Professor Tait, without, as far as I can learn, publishing

any independent calculation of the age of the earth, has lent the weight of his

authority to a period of ten million years, or half of Lord Kelvin's minimum. But
in making this suggestion he apparently feels neither interest nor responsibility in

establishing the data of the calculations which he borrowed to obtain therefrom a
very different result from that obtained by their author.

Professor Perry's object was not to substitute a more correct age for that

obtained by Lord Kelvin, but rather to show that the data from which the true

Weage could be calculated are not really available.                             obtain different results by

making different assumptions, and there is no sufficient evidence for accepting one

assumption rather than another. Nevertheless, there is some evidence which

indicates that the interior of tlie earth in all probability conducts better than the

surface. Its far higher density is consistent with the belief that it is rich iu

metals, free or combined. Professor Schuster concludes that the internal electric

conductivity must be considerably greater than the external. Geologists have
argued from the amount of folding to which the crust has been subjected that
cooling must have taken place to a greater depth than 120 miles, as assumed in
Lord Kelvin's argument. Professor Perry's assumption would involve cooling to
a much greater depth.

      Professor Perry's conclusion that the age of the habitable earth is lengthened

by increased conductivity is the very reverse of that to which we should be led
by a superficial examination of the case. Professor Tait, indeed, in the letter
to which I have already alluded, has said : ' Why, then, drag in mathematics

at all, since it is absolutely obvious that the better conductor the interior in

comparison with the skin, the longer ago must it have been when the whole was

at 7000 F., the state of the skin being as at present ? ' Professor Perry, in reply,

pointed out that one mathematician who had refuted the tidal retardation

argument ^ had assumed that the conditions described by Professor Tait would

have involved a shorter period of time. And it is probable that Lord Kelvin
--thought
           the  same                        for he had assumed conditions  which would give the result
                                         ;
--so he believed at the time most acceptable to the geologist and biologist.

Professor Perry's conclusion is very far from obvious, and without the mathematical

reasoning would not be arrived at by the vast majority of thinking men.

The        ' natural  man                          without  mathematics  would  say,  so  far  from  this  being
                                                '

' absolutely obvious,' it is quite clear that increased conductivity, favouring escape

of heat, would lead to more rapid cooling, and would make Lord Kelvin's age even

ishorter.

     The argument can, however, be put clearly without mathematics, and, with
Professor Perry's help, I am able to state it' in a few words. Lord Kelvin's
assumption of an earth resembling the surface rock in its relations to heat leads to

the present condition of things, namely, a surface gradient of 1 ° F. for every
50 feet, in 100,000,000 years, more or less. Deeper than 150 miles he imagines

                ' Kev. M. H. Close in R. Dublin Soc, February 1878.
--814 REPORT 1896.

that there has heen almost no cooling. If, however, we take one of the cases

put by Professor Perry, and assume that below a depth of four miles there is ten

times the conductivity, we find that after a period of 10,000,000,000 years the
gradient at the surface is still 1 " F. for every 50 feet ; but that we have to
descend to a depth of 1500 miles before we find the initial temperature of

7000 ° F. undiminished by cooling. In fact the earth, as a whole, has cooled

far more quickly than under Lord Kelvin's conditions, the greater conductivity

enabling a far larger amount of the internal heat to escape ; but in escaping it

has kept up the temperature gradient at the surface.

Lord Kelvin, replying to Professor Perry's criticisms, quite admits that the age

at which he had arrived by the use of this argument may be insufficient. Thus,

myhe says, in his letter: ^ 'I thought  range from twenty millions to 400 millions

was probably wide enough, but it is quite possible that I should have put the

superior limit a good deal higher, perhaps 4000 instead of 400.'

The third argument was suggested by Helmholtz, and depends on the life of

the sun. If the energy of the sun is due only to the mutual gravitation of its

parts, and if the sun is now of uniform density, ' the amount of heat generated by

his contraction to his present volume would have been sufficient to last eighteen
million years at his present rate of radiation.' - Lord Kelvin ^-ejects the assump-

tion of uniform density, and is, in consequence of this change, able to offer a much

higher upward limit of 500 million years.

This argument also implies the strictest uniformitarianism as regards the sun.

We know that other suns may suddenly gain a great accession of energy, so that
Wetheir radiation is immensely increased.
                                           only detect such changes when they

are large and sudden, but they prepare us to believe that smaller accessions maybe

much more frequent, and perhaps a normal occurrence in the evolution of a sun.

Such accessions may have followed from the convergence of a stream of meteors.
Again, it is possible that the radiation of the sun may have been diminished

and his energy conserved by a solar atmosphere.

     Newcomb has objected to these two possible modes by which the life of the
sun may have been greatly lengthened, that a lessening of the sun's heat by under
a quarter would cause all the water on the earth to freeze, while an increase of much

over half would probably boil it all away. But such changes in the amount of

radiation received would follow from a greater distance from the sun of

15^ per cent., and a greater proximity to him of 18'4 per cent., respectively.
Venus is inside the latter limit, and Mars outside the former ; and yet it would be
a very large assumption to conclude that all the water in the former is steam, and
all in the latter ice. Indeed, the existence of water and the melting of snow on Mars

are considered to be thoroughly well authenticated. It is further possible that in

a time of lessened solar radiation the eartii may have possessed an atmosphere

which would retain a larger proportion of the sun's heat ; and the internal heat of

the earth itself, great lakes of lava under a canopy of cloud for example, may have

played an important part in supplying warmth.

    Again we have a greater age if there was more energy available than in

Helmholtz's hypothesis. Lord Kelvin maintains that this is improbable because

of the slow rotation of the sun, but Perry has given reasons for an opposite

conclusion.

The collapse of the first argument of tidal retardation and of the second of the

cooling of the earth warn us to beware of a conclusion founded on the assumption
that the sun's energy depends, and has ever depended, on a single source of which
we know the beghming and the end. It may be safely maintained that such a
conclusion has not that degree of certainty which justifies the followers of one
science in assuming that the conclusion of other sciences must be wrong, and in

disregarding the evidence brought forward by workers in other lines of research.

   We must freely admit that this third argument has not yet fully shared the fate

             ' JVature, January 3, 1895.
             ^ Newcomb's Popular Astronomy, p. 523.

of the two other lines of reasoning. Indeed, Professor George Darw in, although

not feeling the force of these latter, agrees with Lord Kelvin in regarding 500

million years as the maximum life of the sun.^

   We may observe, too, that 500 million years is by no means to be despised ; a

great deal may happen in such a period of time. Although I should be very sorry

to say that it is sufficient, it is a very different offer from Professor" Tait's

ten million.

In drawing up this account of the physical arguments, I owe almost everything

to Professor Perry for his articles in ' Nature ' (January 3 and April 18, 1895),
and his kindness in explaining any difficulties that arose. I have thought it right

to enter into these argumeuts in some detail, and to consume a considerable pro-

portion of our time in their discussion. This was imperatively necessary, because

they claimed to stand as barriers across our path, and, so long as they were admitted

to be impassable, any further progress was out of the question. "NVhat I hope has

been an unbiassed examination has shown that, as barriers, they are more imposing

than  effective                                        and we  are  free  to  proceed, and  to  look  for  the  conclusions warranted
                                                    ;

by our own evidence. In this matter we are at one with the geologists ; for, as

has been already pointed out, we rely on them for an estimate of the time occupied

by the deposition of the stratified rocks, while they rely on us for a conclusion as to

how far this period is sufficient for the whole of organic evolution.

    First, then, we must briefly consider the geological argument, and I cannot do
better than take the case as put by Sir Archibald Geikie in his Presidential Address

to this Association at Edinburgh in 189i!.

     Arguing from the amount of material removed from the land by denuding
agencies, and carried down to the sea by rivers, he showed that the time required

to reduce the height of the land by one foot varies, according to the activity of the
agencies at work, from 730 years to 6800 years. But this also supplies a measure

of the rate of deposition of rock ; for the same material is laid down elsewhere,

and would of course add the same height of one foot to some other area equal in

size to that from which it was removed.

The next datum to be obtained is the total thickness of the stratified rocks

from the Cambrian system to the present day. ' On a reasonable computation

these stratified masses, where most fully developed, attain a united thickness of

not less than 100,000 feet. If they were all laid down at the most rapid recorded

rate of denudation, they would require a period of seventy-three millions of years

for their completion. If they were laid down at the slowest rate, they would
demand a period of not less than 680 millions.'

The argument that geological agencies acted much more vigorously in past

times he entirely refuted by pointing to the character of the deposits of which the
Westratified series is composed. '
                                                                              can see no proof whatever, nor even any

evidence which suggests that on the whole the rate of waste and sedimentation

was more rapid during Mesozoic and Paleozoic time than it is to-day. Had there

been any marked difference in this rate from ancient to modern times, it would be

incredible that no clear proof of it should have been recorded in the crust of the

earth.'

    It may therefore be inferred that the rate of deposition was no nearer the more

rapid than the slower of the rates recorded above, and, if so, the stratified rocks

would have been laid down in about 400 million years.

     There areother arguments favouring the uniformity of conditions throughout
the time during which the stratified rocks were laid down, in addition to those
which are purely geological and depend upon the character of the rocks themselves.
Although more biological than geological, these arguments are best considered

here.

    The geological agency to which attention is chiefly directed by those who desire
to hurry up the phenomena of rock formation is that of the tides. But it seems

                                                       ' British Association Bejwrts, 1886, pp. 514-518.
816 REPORT-- 1896.

certain that the tides were not sufficiently higher in Silurian times to prevent the

deposition of certain beds of great thickness under conditions as tranquil as any of

which we have evidence in the case of a formation extending over a large area.
From the character of the organic remains it is known that these beds were laid

down in the sea, and there are the strongest grounds for believing that they were

accumulated along shores and in fairly shallow water. The remains of extremely

delicate organisms are found in immense numbers, and over a very large area.

The recent discovery, in the Silurian system of America, of trilobites, with their

Newlong delicate antennae perfectly preserved, proves that in one locality (Rome,

York State) the tranquillity of deposition was quite as profound as in any locality

yet discovered on this side of the Atlantic.

There are, then, among the older Palaeozoic rocks a set of deposits than which

we can imagine none better  calculated  to    test the force of  the tides                                     and we find
                                                                                                            ;

that they supply evidence for exceptional tranquillity of conditions over a long

period of time.

There is other evidence of the permanence, throughout the time during which

the stratified rocks were deposited, of conditions not very dissimilar to those

which obtain to-day. Thus the attachments of marine organisms, which are per-

manently rooted to the bottom or on the shores, did not differ in strength from

those which we now find^an indication that the strains due to the movements

of the sea did not greatly differ in the past.

   We have evidence of a somewhat similar kind to prove uniformity in the

movements of the air. The expanse of the wings of flying organisms certainly

does not differ in a direction which indicates any greater violence in the atmo-

spheric conditions. Before the birds had become dominant among the larger

flying organisms, their place was taken by the flying reptiles, the pterodactyls,
and before the appearance of these we know that, in Palaeozoic times, the insects

were of immense size, a dragon-fly from the Carboniferous rocks of France being

upwards of 2 feet in the expanse of its wings. As one group after another of

widely dissimilar organisms gained control of the air, each was in turn enabled to
increase to the size which was best suited to such an environment, but we find that

the limits which obtain to-day were not widely different in the past. And this is

evidence for the uniformity in the strains due to wind and storm no less than to

those due to gravity. Furthermore, the condition of the earth's surface at present

shows us how extremely sensitive the flying organism is to an increase in the

former of these strains, when it occurs in proximity to the sea. Thus it is well

known that an unusually large proportion of the Madeiran beetles are wingless,

while those which require the power of flight possess it in a stronger degree than

on continental areas. This evolution in two directions is readily explained by the

destruction by drowning of the winged individuals of the species which can

manage to live without the power of flight, and of the less strongly winged indi-

viduals of those which need it. Species of the latter kind cannot live at all in the

far more stormy Kerguelen Land, and the whole of the in.sect fauna is wingless.

The size and strength of the trunks of fossil trees afford, as Professor George

Darwin has pointed out, evidence of uniformity in the strains due to the condition

of the atmosphere.

   We can trace the prints of raindrops at various geological horizons, and in some

cases found in this country it is even said tliat the eastern side of the depressions

is the more deeply pitted, proving that the rain drove from the west, as the great

majority of our storms do to-day.

     When, therefore, we are accused of uniformitarianism, as if it were an entirely
unproved assumption, we can at any rate point to a large body of positive evidence

which supports our contention, and the absence of any evidence against it.

Furthermore, the data on which we rely are likely to increase largely, as the result

of future work.

After this interpolation, chiefly of biological argument in support of the geo-

logist, I cannot do better than bring the geological evidence to a close in the words

which conclude Sir Archibald Geikie's address : ' After careful reflection on the

subject, I affirm that the geological record furnishes a mass of evidence which no
                                                --

arguments drawn from other departments of Nature can explain away, and which,

it seems to me, cannot be satisfactorily interpreted save with an allowance of time

much beyond the narrow limits which recent physical speculation would concede.'

     In his letter to Professor Perry,' Lord Kelvin says:

    ' So far as under^-ound heat alone is concerned, you are quite right that my

estimate was 100 million, and please remark - that that is all Geiliie wants ; but I

should be exceedingly frightened to meet him now with only twenty million in

my mouth.'

    We have seen, however, that Geikie considered the rate of sedimentation to

be, on the whole, uniform with that which now obtains, and this would demand
a period of nearly 400 million years. He points out, furthermore, that the time
must be greatly increased on account of the breaks and inteiTuptions which occur
in the series, so that we shall probably get as near an estimate as is possible from

the data which are available by taking 450 million as the time during which the

stratified rocks were formed.

Before leaving this part of the subject, I cannot refrain from suggesting a liae

of inquiry which may very possibly furnish important data for checking the

estimates at present formed by geologists, and which, if the mechanical difficulties

can be overcome, is certain to lead to results of the greatest interest and importance.

Ever since the epoch-making voyage of the ' Challenger,' it has been known that

the floor of the deep oceans outside the shallow shelf which fringes the continental

areas is covered by a peculiar deposit formed entirely of meteoric and volcanic

dust, the waste of floating pumice, and the hard parts of animals living in the

ocean. Of these latter only the most resistant can escape the powerful solvent

agencies. Many observations prove that the accumulation of this deposit is

extremely slow. One indication of this is especially convincing : the teeth of sharks

-- --and the most resistant part of the skeleton the ear- bones of whales are so thickly

spread over the surface that they are continually brought up in the dredge, while

sometimes a single haul will yield a large number of them. Imagine the count-

less generations of sharks and whales which must have succeeded each other in

order that these insignificant portions of them should be so thickly spread over

Wethat vast area which forms the ocean floor !  have no reason to suppose that

sharks and whales die more frequently in the deep ocean than in the shallow

fringing seas ; in fact, many observations point in the opposite direction, for

wounded and dying whales often enter shallow creeks and inlets, and not uncom-

monly become stranded. And yet these remains of sharks and whales, although

well known in the stratified rocks which were laid down in comparatively shallow

water and near coasts, are only found in certain beds, and then in far less abun-

Wedance than in the oceanic deposit.  can only explain this difference by supposing

that the latter accumulate with such almost infinite slowness as compared with

the continental deposits that these remains form an important and conspicuous

constituent of the one, while they are merely found here and there when looked

for embedded in the other. The rate of accumulation of all other constituents is

so slow as to leave a layer of teeth and ear-bones uncovered, or covered by so thin

a deposit that the dredge can collect them freely. Dr. John Murray calculates

that only a few inches of this deposit have accumulated since the Tertiary period.

These most interesting facts prove, furthermore, that the great ocean basins and

continental areas have occupied the same relative positions since the formation of the

Wefirst stratified rocks; for no oceanic deposits are found anywhere in the latter.

know the sources of the oceanic deposit, and it might be possible to form an esti-

mate, within wide limits, of its rate of accumulation. If it were possible to

ascertain its thickness by means of a boring, some conclusions as to the time which

has elapsed during the lifetime of certain species perhaps even the lifetime of the

-- --oceans themselves might be arrived at. Lower down the remains of earlier

species would probably be found. The depth of this deposit and its character at

deeper levels are questions of overwhelming interest ; and perhaps even more so is

818 REPORT--1896.

the question as to what lies beneath. Long before the 'Challenger' had proved
the persistence of oceanic and continental areas, Darwin, with extraordinary fore-
sight, and opposed by all other naturalists and geologists, including his revered
teacher, Lyell, had come to the same conclusion. His reasoning on the subject is
so convincing that it is remarkable that he made so few converts, and this is all
the more surprising since the arguments were published in the ' Origin of Species/
which in other respects produced so profound an eflect. In speculating as to the
rocks in which the remains of the ancestors of the earliest known fossUs may still
exist, he suggested that, although the existing relationship between the positions
of our present oceans and continental areas is of immense antiquity, there is no
reason for the belief that it has persisted for an indefinite period, but that at some
time long antecedent to the earliest known fossiliferous rocks 'continents may
have existed where oceans are now spread out ; and clear and open oceans maj-
have existed where our continents now stand.' Not the least interesting result
would be the test of this hypothesis, which would probably be forthcoming as the
result of boring into the floor of a deep ocean ; for although, as Darwin pointed
out, it is likely enough that such rocks would be highly metamorphosed, yet it
might still be possible to ascertain whether they had at any time formed part of a
continental deposit, and perhaps to discover much more than this. Such an under-
taking might be carried out in conjunction with other investigations of the highest
interest, such as the attempt to obtain a record of the swing of a pendulum at the
bottom of the ocean.

  We --now come to the strictly biological part of our subject to the inquiry as

to how much of the whole scheme of organic evolution has been worked out in
the time during which the fossiliferous rocks were formed, and how far, therefore,

the time required by the geologist is sufficient.

    It is first necessary to consider Lord Kelvin's suggestion that life may have

--reached the earth on a meteorite a suggestion which might be made the basis

of an attempt to rescue us from the dilemma in which we were placed by the

insufficiency of time for evolution. It might be argued that the evolution which

took place elsewhere may have been merely completed, in a comparatively brief

space of time, on our earth.

   We know nothing of the origin of life here or elsewhere, and our only

attitude towards this or any other hypothesis on the subject is that of the
anxious inquirer for some particle of evidence. But a few brief considerations
will show that no escape from the demands for time can be gained in this way.

     Our argument does not deal with the time required for the origin of life, or
for the development of the lowest beings with which we are acquainted from the
first formed beings, of which we know nothing. Both these processes may have

required an immensity of time ; but as we know nothing whatever about them, and
have as yet no prospect of acquiring any infoi-mation, we are compelled to confine
ourselves to as much of the process of evolution as we can infer from the structure

--of living and fossil forms that is, as regards animals, to the development of the

simplest into the most complex Protozoa, the evolution of the Metazoa from the
Protozoa, and the branching of the former into its numerous Phyla, with all their

classes, orders, families, genera, and species. But we shall find that this is

quite enough to necessitate a very large increase in the time estimated by the

geologist.

     The Protozoa, simple and complex, still exist upon the earth in countless
species, together with the Metazoan Phyla. Descendants of forms which in their
day constituted the beginning of that scheme of evolution which 1 have defined
above, descendants, furthermore, of a large proportion of those forms which, age
after age, constituted the shifting phases of its onward progress, still exist, and in
a sufficiently unmodified condition to enable us to reconstruct, at any rate in
mere outUne, the history of the past. Innumerable details and many phases of
supreme importance are still hidden from us, some of them perhaps never to be
recovered. But this frank admission, and the eager and premature attempts to
expound too much, to go further than the evidence permits, must not be allowed
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  819

to throw an undeserved suspicion upon conclusions wliicli are sound and -well
supported, upon the firm conviction of every zoologist that the freneral trend of
evolution has been, as I have stated it, that each of the Metazoan JPhyla originated,

directly or indirectly, in the Protozoa.

     The argument founded on the meteorite hypothesis would, however, require
that the process of evolution went backward on a scale as vast as that on which
it went forward ; that certain descendants of some central type, coming to the earth
on a meteorite, gradually lost their Metazoan complexity and developed backward
into the Protozoa, throwing off the lower Metazoan Phyla on the way, while cer-
tain other descendants evolved all the higher Metazoan groups. Such a process
would shorten the period of evolution by half, but it need hardly be said that all

available evidence is entirely against it.

     The only other assumption by means of which the meteorite hypothesis might
be used to shorten the time is even more wild and improbable. Thus it might be

supposed that the evolution which we believe to have taken place on this earth

-- --really took place elsewhere at any rate as regards all its main lines and that

samples of all the various phases, including the earliest and simplest, reached us
by a regular meteoric service, which was established at some time after the com-
pletion of the scheme of organic evolution. Hence the evidences which Ave study
would point to an evolution which occurred in some unknown world with an age
which even Professor Tait has no desire to limit.

      If these wild assumptions be rejected, there remains the supposition that, if life

was brought by a meteorite, it was life no higher than that of the simplest Proto-

--zoou a supposition which leaves our argument intact. The alternative supposition,

that one or more of the Metazoan Phyla were introduced in this way while the

others were evolved from the terrestrial Protozoa, is hardly worth consideration.

In the first place, some evidence of a part in a common scheme of evolution is to

be found in every Phylum. In the second place, the gain would be small ; the
arbitrary assumption would only affect the evidence of the time required for evolu-
tion derived from the particular Phylum or Phyla of supposed meteoric origin.

     The meteoric hypothesis, then, can only affect our argument by making the
most improbable assumptions, for which, moreover, not a particle of evidence can

be brought forward.

     AVe are therefore free to follow the biological evidence fearlessly. It is neces-
sary, in the first place, to expand somewhat the brief outline of the past history of
the animal kingdom, which has already been given. Since the appearance of the
' Origin of Species,' the zoologist, in making his classifications, has attempted as far
as possible to set forth a genealogical arrangement. Our purpose will be served by
an account of the main outlines of a recent classification, which has been framed

with a due considerntion for all sides of zoological research, new and old, and
which has met with general approval. Professor Lankester divides the animal
kingdom into two grades, the higher of which, the Enterozoa (Metazoa), were
derived from the lower, the Plastidozoa (Protozoa). Each of these grades is again
divided into two sub-grades, and each of these is again divided into Phyla, cor-

responding more or less to the older sub-kingdoms. Beginning from below, the most
primitive animals in existence are found in tlie seven ]?hyla of the lower Protozoan
sub-grade, the Gymnomyxa. Of these unfortunately only two, the Reticularia (Fora-
minifera) and Radiolaria, possess a structure which renders possible their preservation

in the rocks. The lowest and simplest of these Gymnomyxa represent the starting-
point of that scheme of organic evolution which we are considering to-day. The

higher order of Protozoan life, the sub-grade Corticata, contains three Phyla, no one
of which is available in the fossil state. They are, however, of great interest and
importance to us as showing that the Protozoan type assumes a far higher organ-

isation on its way to evolve the more advanced grade of animal life. The first-

formed of these latter are contained in the two Phyla of the sub-grade Ccelentera,
the Porifera or Sponges, and the Nematophora or Corals, Sea-anemones,
Hydrozoa and allied groups. Both of these Phyla are plentifully represented in
the fossil state. It is considered certain that the latter of these, the Nematophora,
820 REPORT-- 189G.

gave rise to the higlier suTj-nrrade, the Coelomata, or animals with a ccelom oi*
body-eavity suiTOuuding the digestive tract. This latter includes all the remain-

--ing species of animals in nine Phyla, five of which are found fossil the Echino-

derma, Gephyrea, MoUusca, Appendioulata, and Vertebrata.
     Before proceeding further I wish to lay emphasis on the immense evolutionary

history which must have been passed through before the ancestor of one of the
higher of these nine Phyla came into being. Let us consider one or two examples,
since the establishment of this position is of the utmost importance for our argu-

--ment. First, consider the past history of the Vertebrata of the common ancestor

of our Balanoglossus, Tunicates, Amphioxus, Lampreys, Fishes, Dipnoi, Amphibia,
Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals. Although zoologists difler very widely in their
opinions as to the affinities of this ancestral form, they all agree in maintaining
that it did not arise direct from the Nematophora in the lower sub-grade of
Metazoa, but that it was the product of a long history within the Ccelomate sub-
grade. The question as to which of the other Oojlomate Phyla it was associated
with will form the subject of one of our discussions at this meeting ; and I will
therefore say no more upon this period of its evolution, except to point out that
the very question itself, 'the ancestry of Vertebrates,' only means a rela-
tivelj' small part of the evolutionary liistory of the ^"ertebrate ancestor within

the Ccelomate group. For when we have decided the question of the other
Ccelomate Phylum or Phyla to which the ancestral Vertebrate belonged, there
remains of course the history of that Phylum or those Phyla earlier than the point

at which the Vertebrate diverged, right back to the origin of the Coelomata ; while,
beyond and below, the wide gulf between this and the Coelentera had to be
crossed, and then, probably after a long history as a Coelenterate, the widest and

--most significant of all the morphological intervals that between the lowest

Metazoou and the highest Protozoon^was traversed. But this was by no means
all. There remains the history within the higher Protozoan sub-grade, in the

interval from this to the lower, and within the lower sub-grade itself, until we

finally retrace our steps to the lowest and simplest forms. It is impossible to
suppose that all this history of change can have been otherwise than immensely
prolonged ; for it will be shown below that all the available evidence warrants the
belief that the changes during these earlier phases were at least as slow as

those which occurred later.

     If we take the history of another of the higher Phyla, the Appendioulata, we
find that the evidence points in the same direction. The common ancestor of our

Rotifera, earthworms, leeches, Peripatus, centipedes, insects, Crustacea, spiders
 and scorpions, and forms allied to all these, is generally admitted to have been
 Chi?etopod-like, and probably arose in relation to the beginnings of certain other

Ccelomate Phyla, such as tlae Gephyrea and perhaps MoUusca. At the origin of
the Coelomate'sub-grade the common ancestor of all Cojlomate Phyla is reached,

 and its evolution has been already traced in the case of the Vertebrata.

     What is likely to be the relation between the time required for the evolution
of the ancestor of a Ccelomate Phylum and that reqxiired ibr the evolution, which
 subsequently occurred, within the Phylum itself? The only indication of an

 answer to this question is to be found in a study of the rate of evolution in the
 lower parts of the animal kingdom as compared with that in the higher. Con-

 trary, perhaps, to anticipation, we find that all the evidences of rapid evolution are

 confined to the most advanced of the smaller groups within the highest Phyla,

 and especially to the higher classes of the Vertebrata. Such evidence as we have
 strongly indicates the most remarkable persistence of the lower animal types. Thus

 in the class Imperforata of the Reticularia (Foramiuifera) one of our existing
 genera (Saccamina) occurs in the Carboniferous strata, another (Trochammina) in

 the Permian, while a single new genus (Receptaculites) occurs in the Silurian and
 Devonian. The evidence from the class Perforata is much stronger, the exist-
 ing genera Nodosaria, Dentalina, Textularia, Grammostomum, Valvulina, and
 Nummulina all occurring in the Carboniferous, together with the new genera

 Archsediscus (?) and Fusulina.

he thrown upon this form in the communication of its veteran defender, Sir

William Dawson, whom we are all glad to welcome.

Passing the Radiolaria, with delicate skeletons less suited for fossilisation, and

largely pelagic, and therefore less likely to reach the strata laid down along the

fringes of the continental areas, the next Phylum which is found in a fossil state

is that of the Porifera, including the sponges, and divided into two classes, the

Calcispongiffi and Silicospongiie. Although the fossilisation of sponges is in many

cases very incomplete, distinctly recognisable traces can be made out in a large
number of strata. From these we know that representatives of all the groups of

both classes (except the Halisarcidse, which have no hard parts) occurred in the

Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous systems. The whole Phylum is an example of
long persistence with extremely little change. And the same is true of the Nema-
tophora: new groups indeed come in, sometimes extremely rich in species, such as

the Paleozoic Rugose corals and Graptolites; but they existed side by side with

representatives of existing groups, and they are not in themselves primitive or

Aancestral.      study of the immensely numerous fossil corals reveals no advance in

organisation, while researches into the structure of existing Alcyonaria and Hydro-

corallina have led to the interpretation of certain Palaeozoic forms which were pre-

viously obscure, and the conclusion that they find their place close beside the

living species.

     All available evidence points to the extreme slowness of progressive evolu-

tionary changes in the Cojlenterate Phyla, although the Protozoa, if we may judge

by the Reticularia (Foraminifera), are even more conservative.

    When we consider later on the five Ccelomate Phyla which occur fossil, we

shall find that the progressive changes were slower and indeed hardly appreciable

in the two lower and less complex Phyla, viz., the Echinoderma, and (Sephyrea,

as compared with the Mollusca, Appendiculata, and Vertebrata.

    Within these latter Phyla we have evidence for the evolution of higher groups
presenting a more or less marked advance in organisation. And not only is the

rate of development more rapid in the highest Phyla of the animal kingdom, but
it appears to be most rapid when dealing with the highest animal tissue, the
central nervous system. The chief, and doubtless the most significant, difference
between the early Tertiary mammals and those which succeeded them, between the

Secondary and Tertiary reptiles, between man and the mammals most nearly

allied to him, is a difference in the size of the brain. In all these cases an enormous

increase in this, the dominant tissue of the body, has taken place in a time which,

geologically speaking, is very brief.

    When glancing later on over the evolution which has taken place within

the Phyla, further details upon this subject will be given, although in this as in

other cases the time at our disposal demands that the exposition of evidence
must largely yield to an exposition of the conclusions which follow from its

study. And undoubtedly a study of all the available evidence points to the con-

clusion that in the lower grade, sub-grades, and Phyla of the animal kingdom

Weevolution has been extremely slow as compared with that in the higher.  do

not know the reason. It may be that this remarkable persistence through the

stratified series of deposits is due to an innate fixity of constitution which has
rigidly limited the power of variation ; or, more probably perhaps, that the lower
members of the animal kingdom were, as they are now, more closely confined to
particular environments, with particular sets of conditions, with which they had to

cope, and, this being successfully accomplished, natural selection has done little
more than keep up a standard of organisation which was sufficient for their needs

while the higher and more aggressive forms, ranging over many environments and
always prone to encounter new sets of conditions, were compelled to undergo respon-

sive changes or to succumb. But, whatever be the cause, the fact remains, and is of

importance for our argument. When the ancestor of one of the higher Phyla

was associated with the lower Phyla of the Ccelomate sub-grade, when further

back it passed through a Ccelenterate, a higher Protozoan, and finally a lower
                     ;

Protozoan phase, we are led to believe that its evolution was probably very slow
as compared with the rate which it subsequently attained. But this conclusion is

of the utmost importance ; for the history contained in the stratified rocks nowhere

reveals to us the origin of a Phylum. And this is not mere negative evidence, but

positive evidence of the most unmistakable character. All the five Coslomate
Phyla which occur fossil appear low down in the Palteozoic rocks, in the Silurian
or Cambrian strata, and they are represented by forms which are very far from being

primitive, or, if primitive, are persistent types, such as Chiton, which are now

living. Thus Vertebrata are represented by fishes, both sharks and ganoids ; the
Appendiculata by cockroaches, scorpions, Limulids, Trilobites, and many Crustacea

the Mollusca by Nautilus and numerous allied genera, by Uentalium, Chiton,

Pteropods, and many Gastropods and Lamellibranchs ; the Gephyrea by very
numerous Brachiopods, and manyPolyzoa ; the Echinoderma byCrinoids, Cystoids,

Blastoids, Asteroids, Ophiuroids, and Echinoids. It is just conceivable, although,

as 1 believe, most improbable, that the Vertebrate Phylum originated at the time
when the earliest kno'WTi fossiliferous rocks were laid down. It must be remem-
bered, however, that an enormous morphological interval separates the fishes which

appear in the Silurian strata from the lower branches, grades, and classes of the

Phylum in which Balanoglossus, the Ascidians, Amphioxus, and the Lampreys are
placed. The earliest Vertebrates to appear are, in fact, very advanced members of
the Phylum, and, from the point of view of anatomy, much nearer to man than to
Amphioxus. If, however, we grant the improbable contention that so highly

organised an animal as a shark could be evolved from the ancestral vertebrate in
the period which intervened between the earliest Cambrian strata and the Upper
Silurian, it is quite im-i)ossible to urge the same with regard to the other Phyla.

It has been shown above that when these appear in the Cambrian and Silurian,

they are flourishing in full force, while their numerous specialised forms are a
positive proof of a long antecedent history within the fimits of the Phylum.

     If however, we assume for the moment tliat the Phyla began in the Cambrian,

the geologist's estimate must still be increased considerably, and perhaps doubled,
in order tfl account for the evolution of the higher Phyla from forms as low as

many which are now known upon the earth ; unless, indeed, it is supposed, against

the weio"ht of all such evidence as is available, that the evolutionary history in

these early times was comparatively rapid.
     To recapitulate, if we represent the history of animal evolution by the form of

a tree we find that the following growth took place in some age antecedent to the

earliest fossil records, before the establishment of the higher Phyla of the animal

king-dom. The main trunk representing the lower Protozoa divided, originating
theliio-her Protozoa ; the latter portion again divided, probably in a threefold man-
ner ori"-inating the two lowest Metazoan Phyla, constituting the Crelentera. The
 branch representing the higher of these Phyla, the Nematophora. divided, origin-
atino- the lower Ccelomate Phyla, which again branched and originated the higher

Pliyta. And, as has been shown above, the relatively ancestral line, at every

stage of this complex liistory, after originating some higher line, itself continued

down to the present day, throughout the whole series of fossiliferous rocks, with
but little change in its general characters, and practically nothing in the way of
progressive evolution. Evidences of marked advance are to be found alone in the

 most advanced groups of the latest highest products--the Phyla formed by the

 last of these divisions.

HowIt may be asked,  is it possible for the zoologist to feel so confident

as to the past history of the various animal groups ? I have already explained

that he does not feel this confidence as regards the details of the history,

but as to its general lines. The evidence which leads to this conviction is

based upon the fact that animal structure and mode of development can be, and

have been, handed down from generation to generation from a period far more

remote than that which is represented by the earliest fof?sils ; that fundamental

facts in structure and development may remain changeless amid endless changes of

a more o-eneral character ; that especially favourable conditions have preserved

ancestral forms comparatively unchanged. Working- upon this material, com-

parative anatomy and embryology can reconstruct for us the general aspects of a

history which took place long before the Cambrian rocks were deposited. This

line of reasoning may appear very speculative and unsound, and it may easily

become so when pressed too far. But applied with due caution and reserve, it
may be trusted to supply us with an immense amount of valuable information

which cannot be obtained in any other way. Furthermore, it is capable of stand-

ing the very true and searching test supplied by the verification of predictions

made on its authority. JNlany foots taken together lead the zoologist to be-
A B Blieve that
was descended from C through ; but if this be true, should

possess certain characters which are not known to belong to it. Under the in-

spiration of hypothesis a more searching investigation is made, and the characters

are found. Again, that relatively small amount of the whole scheme of animal

evolution which is contained in the fossiliferous rocks has furnished abundant

confirmation of the validity of the zoologist's method. The comparative anatomy

of the higher vertebrate classes leads the zoologist to believe that the toothless

beak and the fused caudal vertebrae of a bird were not ancestral characters, but

were at some time derived from a condition more conformable to the general plan

of vertebrate construction, and especially to that of reptiles. Numerous secondary

fossils prove to us that the birds of that time possessed teeth and separate caudal

vertebrae, culminating in the long lizard-like tail of Archjeopteryx.

Prediction and confirmation of this kind, both zoological and palaeontological,

have been going on ever since the historic point of view was adopted by the

naturalist as the outcome of Darwin's teaching, and the zoologist may safely claim

that his method, confirmed by palaeontology so far as evidence is available, may be

extended beyond the period in which such evidence is to be found.

    And now our last endeavour must be to obtain some conception of the amount

of evolution which has taken place within the higher Phyla of the animal kingdom

during the period in which the fossiliferous rocks were deposited. The evidence

must necessarily be considered very briefly, and we shall be compelled to omit the

Tertebrata altogether.

     The Phylum Appendiculata is divided by Lankester into three branches, the

first containing the Rotifera,the second the Chaetopoda, the third the Arthropoda.

Of these the second is the oldest, and gave rise to the other two, or at any rate to
the Arthropoda, with which we are alone concerned, inasmuch as the fossil records

of the others are insufficient. The Arthropoda contain seven classes, divided into

--two grades, according to the presence or absence of antennae the Ceratophora,

containing the Peripatoidea, the Myriapoda, and the Hexapoda (or insects) ; the

Acerata, containing the Crustacea, Arachnida, and two other classes (the Pantopoda

and Tardigrada) which we need not consider. The first class of the antenna-

--bearing group contains the single genus Peripatus one of the most interesting

and ancestral of animals, as proved by its structure and development, and by its
immense geographical range. Ever since the researches of Moseley and Balfour,
extended more recently by those of Sedgwick, it has been recognised as one of the
most beautiful of the connecting links to be found amongst animals, uuitin"' the
antenna-bearing Arthropods, of which it is the oldest member, with the Chfetopods,

Peripatus is a magnificent example of the far-reaching conclusions of zoology, and
of its superiority to palaeontology as a guide in unravelling the tangled history of
animal evolution. Peripatus is alive to-day, and can be studied in all the details
of its structure and development ; it is infinitely more ancestral, and teUs of a far
more remote past than any fossil Arthropod, although such fossils are well linown

in all the older of the Palaeozoic rocks. And yet Peripatus is not known as a

fossil. Peripatus has come down, with but little change, from a time, on a mode-
rate estimate, at least twice as remote, and probably many times as remote, as
the earliest known Cambrian fossil. The agencies which, it is believed, have
crushed and heated the Archaean rocks so as to obliterate the traces of life which
they contained were powerless to eflace this ancient type ; for, although the passing

generations may have escaped record, the likeness of each was stamped on that
                                                                                        .

·which, succeeded it, and has continued down to the present day. It is, of course,
a perfectly trite and obvious conclusion, but not the less one to be wondered at, that
the force of heredity should thus far outlast the ebb and flow of terrestrial change

throughout the vast period over which the geologist is our guide.
      If, however, the older PaliBOZoic rocks tell us nothing of the origin of the

antenna-bearing Arthropods, what do they tell us of the history of the Myriapod

and Hexapod classes?                                                   ..

The Myriapods are well represented in raloeozoic strata, two species being
found in the Devonian and no less than thirty-two in the Carboniferous. Although

placed in an order (Archipolypoda) separate from those of living Myriapods, these
species are by no means primitive, and do not supply any information as to the

steps by which the class arose. The imperfection of the record is well seen in tlie
traces of this class ; for between the Carboniferous rocks and the Ohgocene there

are no remains of undoubted Myriapods.

   We now come to the consideration of insects, of which an adequate discussion

would occupy a great deal too much of your time. An immense number of species
are found in the Palsozoic rocks, and t'hese are considered by Scudder, the great
authority on fossil insects, to form an order, the Palffiodictyoptera, distinct from any

of the existing orders. The latter, he believes, were evolved from the former in
Mesozoic times. These views do not appear to derive support from the wonderful
discoveries of M. Brongniart ' in the Upper Carboniferous of Commentry in the

Department of AUier in Central France. Concerning this marvellous assemblage of

species, arranged by their discoverer into 46 genera and 101 species, Scudder truly

' Our knowledge of Palajozoic insects will have been increased three or four fold
                      No former contribution in this field can in any way
at a single stroke
compare with it, nor even all former contributions taken together.' -
When we remember that the group of fossil insects, of which so much can be
affirmed by so great an authority as Scudder, lived at one time and iu a single

locality, we cannot escape the conclusion that the insect fauna of the habitable
earth during the whole Palaeozoic period was of immense importance and variety.

Our knowledge of this single group of species is largely due to the accident that coal-

mining in Commentry is carried on in the open air.
Now, these abundant remains of insects, so far from upholding the view that
the existing orders had not been developed in Palaeozoic times, are all arranged by

Brongniart in four out of the nine orders into which insects are usually divided,
                                                     Homoptera. The    importance
viz , the Orthoptera, Neuroptera, Thysanoptera, and  the whole known     Palaeozoic
of the discovery is well seen in the Neuroptera,
fauna of this order being divided into 46 genera and 99 species, of which 33

and 72 respectivelv have been found at Commentry.
    Although tlie Carboniferous insects of Commentry are placed in new families,

some of them come wonderfully near those into which existing insects are classified,
and obviouf^ly form the precursors of these. This is true of the Blattidre, Phasmidse,
AcridiidjB, and Locustidse among the Orthoptera, the Perlidte among the
Neuroptera, and the Fulgoridse among the Homoptera. The diBerences which
separate these existing families from their Carboniferous ancestors are most

interesting and instructive. Thus the Carboniferous cockroaches possessed ovi-

positors, and probably laid their eggs one at a time, while ours are either vivi-

parous or lav their eggs in a capsule. The Protophasmidse resemble living species

in the form of the head, antennae, legs, and body ; but while our species are either

wingle.«s or, with the exception of the female Phyllid^, have the anterior pan-
reduced to tegmina, useless for flight, those of Paleozoic times possessed four well-

developed wings. The forms representing locusts and grasshoppers (PaljEacridiid:e>
possessed long slender antennae like the green grasshoppers (Locustidae), from

which the Acridiidse are now distinguished by their short antennae. The diver-
gence and specialisation which are thus shown are amazingly small in amount. In

  the vast period between the Upper Carboniferous rocks and the present day the cock-
  roaches have gained a rather different wiog venation, and have succeeded in laying
  their eggs in a manner rather more specialised than that of insects in general ; the
   stick insects and leaf insects have lost or reduced their wings, the grasshoppers
  have shortened their antennas. These, however, are the insects which most closely
  resemble the existing species ; let us turn to the forms which exhibit the greatest

  difi'erences. Many species have retained in the adult state characters which are
  now confined to the larval stage of existence, such as the presence of tracheal gills

  on the sides of the abdomen. In some the two membranes of the wing were not

  firmly fixed together, so that the blood could circulate freely between them. On

  the other hand, they are not very firmly fixed together in existing insects. Another
  important point was the condition of the thi-ee thoracic segments, which were quite
  distinct and separate, instead of being fused, as they are now, in the imago stage.

  This external difference probably also extended to the nervous system, so that the

  thoracic ganglia were separate instead of concentrated. The most interesting
  distinction, however, was the possession by manj' species of a pair of prothoracic
 appendages much resembling miniature wings, and which especially suggest the
  appearance assumed by the anterior pair (tegmina) in existing Phasmidce. There
 is some evidence in favour of the view that they were articulated, and they exhibit
 what appears to be a trace of venation. Brongnlart concludes that in still earlier

 strata, insects with six wings will be discovered, or rather insects with six of the
 tracheal gills sufficiently developed to serve as parachutes. Of these the two

 posterior pair developed into the wings as we know them, while the anterior pair

 degenerated, some of the Carboniferous insects presenting us with a stage in
 which degeneration had taken place, but was not complete.

      One very important character was, as I have already pointed out, the enormous
 size reached by insects in this distant period. This was true of the whole known
 fauna as compared with existing species, but it was especially the case with the
 Protodonata, some of tliese giant dragon-flies measuring over two feet in the
 expanse of the wings.

     As regards the habits of life and metamorphoses, Brongniart concludes that

some species of Protoephemeridse, Protoperlidse, &c., obtained their food in an
aquatic larval stage, and did not require it when mature. lie concludes that

the Protodonata fed on other animals, like our dragon-flies ; that the Paleeacridiidift

were herbivorous like our locusts and grasshoppers, the Protolocustidce herbivorous
and animal feeders like our green grasshoppers, the Palseoblattidse omnivorous
like our cockroaches. The Homoptera, too, had elongated sucking mouth-parts
like the existing species. It is known that in Carboniferous times there was a lake

with rivers entering it, at Commentry. From their great resemblance to living-
forms of known habits, it is probable that the majority of these insects lived near

the water and their larva3 in it.

    When we look at this most important piece of research as a whole, we cannot

fail to be struck with the small advance in insect structure which has taken place

since Carboniferous times. All the great questions of metamorphosis, and of the

structures peculiar to insects, appear to have been very much in the position

in which they are to-day. It is indeed probable enough that the orders which
zoologists have always recognised as comparatively modern and specialised, such
as the Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera, had not come into existence.
But as regards the emergence of the class from a single primitive gi'oup, as regards
its approximation towards the Myriapods, which lived at the same time, and of

both towards their ancestor Peripatus, we learn absolutely nothing. All we can
say is that there is evidence for the evolution of the most modern and specialised
members of the class, and some slight progressive evolution in the rest. Such evo-

lution is of importance as giving us some vague conception of the rate at which the

process travels in this division of the Arthropoda. If we look upon development as
a series of paths which, by successively uniting, at length meet in a common point,
then some conception of the position of that distant centre may be gained by
measuring the angle of divergence and finding the number of unions which occur
in a given length. In this case the amount of approximation and union shown in

the interval between the Carboniferou9 period and the present day is relatively

so small that it would require to be multii^lied many times before we could
expect the lines to meet in the common point, the ancestor of insects, to

say nothing of the far more distant past, in which the Tracheate Arthropods

met in an ancestor presenting many resemblances to Peripatus. But it must not

be forgotten that all this vast undefined period is required for the history of one of

the two grades of one of the three branches of the whole Phylum.

Turning now to the brief consideration of the second grade of Arthropods,

distinguished from the first grade by the absence of antennae, the Trilobites are

probably the nearest approach to an ancestral form met with in the fossil state.

Now that the possession of true antennae is certain, it is reasonable to suppose that

the Trilobites represent an early class of the Aceratous branch which had not yet

become Aceratous. They are thus of the deepest interest in helping us to under-

stand the origin of the anteunaless branch, not by the ancestral absence, but by the

loss of true antennae which formerly existed in the group. But the Trilobites did

not themoelves originate the other classes, at any rate during Palaeozoic times.

They represent a large and dominant class, presenting more of the characters of the

common ancestor than the other classes ; but the latter had diverged and had
become distinct long before the earliest fossiliferous rocks ; for we find well-marked

representatives of the Crustacea in Cambrian, and of the Arachnida in Silurian

strata. The Trilobites, moreover, appear in the Cambrian with many distinct and

very different forms, contained in upwards of forty genera, so that we are clearly

very far from the origin of the group.

Of the lower group of Crustacea, the Entomostraca, the Cirripedes are repre-

sented by two genera in the Silurian, the Ostracodes by four genera in the Cambrian

and over twenty in the Silurian : of these latter, two genera (Cythere and Bairdia)

continue right through the fossiliferous series and exist at the present day.

Remains of Phyllopods are more scanty, but can be traced in the Devonian and

Carboniferous rocks. The early appearance of the Cirripedes is of especial interest,

inasmuch as the fixed condition of these forms in tlie mature state is certainly not

primitive, and yet, nevertheless, appears in the earliest representatives.

The higher group, the Malacostraca, are represented by many genera of Phyl-

locarida in the Silurian and Devonian, and two in the Cambrian. These also

afford a good example of the imperfection of the record, inasmuch as no traces of

the group are to be found between the Carboniferous and our existing fauna in

which it is represented by the genus Nebalia. The Phyllocarida are recognised as

the ancestors of the higher Malacostraca, and yet these latter already existed

--in small numbers, it is true side by side with the Phyllocarida in the Devonian.

The evolution of the one into the other must have been much earlier. Here, as in

the Arthropoda, we have evidence of progressive evolution among the highest

groups of the class, as we see in the comparatively late development of the Brachyura

Weas compared with the Macrura.         find no trace of the origin of the class, or of

the larger groups into which it is divided, or, indeed, of the older among the small

groupings into families and genera.^

Of the Arachnida, although some of the most wonderful examples of persistent

types are to be found in this class, but little can be said. Merely to state the

bare fact that three kinds of scorpion are found in the Silurian, two Pedipalpi,

eight scorpions, and two spiders in the Carboniferous, is sufficient to show that the

period computed by geologists must be immensely extended to account for the

development of this class alone, inasmuch as it existed in a highly specialised

condition almost at the beginning of the fossiliferous series ; while, as regards

so extraordinarily complex an animal as a scorpion, nothing apparent in the way of

progressive development has happened since. Professor Lankester has, however,

pointed out to me that the Silurian scorpion Palfeophonus possessed heavier limbs

than those of existing species, and this is a point in favour of an aquatic life like

that of its near relation, Limulus. If so, it is probable that it possessed external

rapid extinction, and consequent reduction in the number of genera and species, is
a summary of the record of the fossiliferous rocks as regards this group and many

others, such as the Trilobites, the Brachiopods, and the Nautilida3. All these

groups begin with many forms in the oldest fossiliferous rocks, and three of them

have left genera practically unchanged from their first appearance to the present

day. What must have been the time required to carry through the vast amount

of structural change implied in the origin of these persistent types and the groups

Palaeozoic rocks and the present day supplies no measurable unit

WeP)Ut I am digressing from the Appendiculate Phylum.                                                                                                                                             have seen that the

fossil record is unusually complete as regards two classes in each grade of the

Arthropod branch, but that these classes were well developed and flourishing in

Palaeozoic times. The only evidence of progressive evolution is in the development

of the highest orders and families of the classes. Of the origin of the classes

nothing is told, and we can hardly escape the conclusion that for the development

of the Arthropod branches from a common Chjetopod-like ancestor, and for the
further development of the classes of each branch, a period many times the length

of the fossiliferous series is required, judging from the insignificant amount of

development which has taken place during the formation of this series.

     It is impossible to consider the other Coelomate Phyla as I have done the

Appendiculata. I can only briefly state the conclusions to which we are led.

As regards the Molluscan Phylum, the evidence is perhaps even stronger than

in the Appendiculata. liepresentatives of the whole of the classes are, it is believed,

found in the Cambrian or Lower Silurian. The Pteropods are generally admitted

to be a recent modification of the Gastropods, and yet, if the fossils described in the

genera Conularia, Ilyolithes, Pterotheca, &c., are true Pteropods, as they are

supposed to be, they occur in the Cambrian and Silurian strata, while the group

of Gastropods from which they almost certainly arose, the BullidjB, are not known

before the Trias. Furthermore, the forms which are clearly the oldest of the

-- --Pteropods Limacina and Spirialis are not known before the beginning of the

Tertiary period. Either there is a mistake in the identification of the Palteozoic

fossils as Pteropods, or tl)e record is even more incomplete than usual, and the

most specialised of all ^Molluscan groups had been formed before the date of the

earliest fossiliferous rocks. Even if this should hereafter be disproved, there can be

no doubt about the early appearance of the Molluscan classes, and that it is the

irony of an incomplete record which places the Cephalopods and Gastropods in the

Cambrian, and the far more ancestral Chiton no lower than the Silurian. Through-

out the fossiliferous series the older families of Gastropods and Lamellibranchs are

followed by numerous other families, which were doubtless derived from them
new and higher groups of Cephalopods were developed, and, with the older groups,

either persisted until the present time or became extinct. But in all this splitting

up of the classes into groups of not widely difierent morphological value, there is

very little' progressive modification                                                                                                                                   and, taking such changes  in such a  period as
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

our unit for the determination of the time which was necessary for the origin of

the classes from a form like Chiton, we are led to the same conclusion as

that which followed from the consideration of the Appendiculata, viz., that

the fossiliferous series would have to be multiplied several times in order to

provide it.

Of the Pbjdum Gephyrea I will only mention the Brachiopods, which are

found in immense profusion in the early Palreozoic rocks and which have occupied

the subsequent time in becoming less dominant and important. So far from

helping us to clear up the mystery which surrounds the origin of the class, the

earliest forms are quite as specialised as those livingnow, and, some of them (Lingula,

Disciiia) eyen generlcally identical. The demand for time to originate the group
is quite as grasping as that of the others -we have been considering.

      All the classes of Echinoderma, except the Holothurians, which do not possess
a structure favourable for fossilisation, are found early in the PaliEozoic rocks,

and many of them in the Cambrian. Although these early forms are very diflerent
from those which succeeded them in the later geological periods, they do not possess
a structure which can be recognised as in any way primitive or ancestral. The

Echinoderma are the most distinct and separate of all the Ccelomate Phyla,
and they were apparently equally distinct and separate at the beginning of the

fossiliferous series.

      In concludine" this imperfect attempt to deal with a very vast subject in a very

short time, I will remind you that we were led to conclude that the evolution of

the ancestor of each of the higher animal Phyla probably occupied a very long-
period, perhaps as long as that required for the evolution which subsequently
occurred witbin the Phylum. But the consideration of the higher Phyla
which occur fossil, except the Vertebrata, leads to the irresistible conclusion that

the whole period in which the fossiliferous rocks were laid down must be
multiplied several times for this later history alone. The period thus obtained

requires to he again increased, and perhaps doubled, for the earlier history.
     In the preparation of the latter part of this address I have largely consulted

Zittel's great work. I wish also to express my thanks to my friend Professor
Lankester, whom I have consulted on many of the details, as well as the general plan

which has been adopted.

  --The following Papers and Reports were read :

         1. On the Cultivation of Oysters as Practised by the Romans.

                              By R. T. GtJNTiiER, M.A.

2. On the Function of certain Diagnostic Characters of Decapod Crustacea.
      By Walter Garstang, M.A., Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford.

     The author deals with the fimctions of various minor characteristics of Decapod

Crustacea, especially the Brachyura.

   A crab's carapace shows two regions subject to great variability of form.

These regions are

     1. The frontal area between the orbits.
     2. The pair of lateral margins.

     The variability consists in the absence or presence of spines and teeth, and the
varvino- length, shape, and number of these structures. These characters are
employed by systematic writers to distinguiali the different species and genera
from one another.

      The author's investigations show that it is not merely the function of the
spines and teeth which is to be considered, but also the function of the spaces and
notches between them.

      The frontal area of crabs is frequently either .3- or o-toothed i.e., either
 2- or 4-notched. Examination of living crabs shows that the notches are corre-
lated functionally with the play of the two pairs of antennae. AVhen the frontal
 area is 3-toothed (e.g., Portuniis pimllus) the first anteunfe are lodged in the two
 notches, and the second antennae project on each side of the frontal prominence.

When the frontal area is .5-toothed (e.g., roli/biti.<i Henslowii) the first antennre

 are lodged in the inner, and the second antennae in the outer pair of notches.

 This tvpe of denticulation is simply an an-angement by which crabs may have

 their antennae protected by a projection of the frontal area, while the possibility
of free movement for the antennfe is provided by the notches along its margin.
 It is scarcely needful to point out that the antennae of a crab are organs of great
importance to it in the search for food, and that in the case of the antennules a
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  829

power of free movement is necessary to enable the crab to detect tbe direction of
odoriferous bodies in its neigiibourliood. At the same time the situation of the
antennae in front of the body renders these organs particularly liable to injury

unless specially protected.
      In regard to the denticulation of the lateral margins of the carapace experi-

ments show that in sand-burrowing species a most important function of the
denticulated margins is in connection with the process of respiration. It may be

termed the ' sieve-function.'

     It is not generalh- known that a crab's chelipeds are in many cases not merely
organs of prehension, but important agents in the respiratory process. The

principal afl'erent apertures to the branchial chambers are situated at the base ot

the chelipeds. When the chelipeds are folded' against the sides of the carapace

(for which purpose they are in many forms specially curved and moulded) a pair
of lateral slit-like channels is produced which lead directly downwards to the
afferent apertures at the basement of the chelipeds. The lateral denticulated

margins of the crab's carapace overhang the slit-like orifices of these accessory
water-channels. "When the crab is partially imbedded in sand it is possible, by

 the addition of colouring matter to the water, to demonstrate that a constant

stream of water Hows from above downwards through these accessory channels
between chelipeds and carapace. The stream enters through the gaps between
the teeth or spines on the lateral margins of the carapace. The teeth act as a
coarse sieve or grating over the slit-like orifice, and prevent foreign bodies, such
as particles of sand and shell, from falling into the channel and blocking its
lumen. The water, after traversing these channels, enters the branchial chambers
 by tbe afferent apertures at the base of the chelipeds, and emerges in front by the
lateral apertures at the sides of the mouth.

     As examples of sand-burrowing crabs to which the above remarks apply,
Bathynectes hmfjipes and Atelecijclus heterodon may be mentioned. In each case
 the lateral denticulated margins of the carapace subserve this sieve-function. Tbe

number of teeth is five in Bathynectes and nine in Atelecyclus, but in each case

 the extent of the denticulated area is commensurate with the extent of the lateral

 inhalant gap between chelipeds and carapace.
      This view is confirmed bj' the fact that in Ebalia and other Leucosiidce, in

 which the afferent water-channel is entirely independent of the chelipeds, the

 lateral margins of the carapace are smooth and free from denticulations.
      In Calappa granulata of the Mediterranean the chelipeds can be pressed

against the smooth sides of the carapace with extreme nicety. The author has
 not yet had an opportunity of studying this crab alive ; but, if the chelipeds are
 held tightly to the body when the animal is buried in the sand, it must be
 impossible for water to enter between tbem and the carapace, except at one point
 on each side, between the anterior margin of the carapace and the curious cock's-
 comb-like crests with which the chelipeds in this genus are provided. The
 antero-lateral margin of the carapace is smooth throughout, but the crests of the
 chelipeds are conspicuously denticulated. The structure of the surrounding parts

 renders it extremely probable that the inhalant current of water passes to the

 afl'erent aperture through the notches between the spines on the crest-like

 expansions.

      In Matuta victor, an East Indian sand-burrowing crab, the inhalant current
 actually seems to enter through the crab's orbits, flowing thence downwards
 tlirougii a special pair of orbital gutters. Here also we find the marginal teeth of

 the carapace obsolete and scarcelj- recognisable.

    A complete reversal of the ordinary branchial currents may take place in

 certain sand-burrowing crabs, as the author has experimentally determined in the
 case of Corystes cassivelaunus, Atelecyclus heterodon, and Flatyotiichus nasutus.

 A similar reversal probably occurs also in Albunea symnista, Platyonichus latipes,

 and several other forms.
       In Corystes and Atelecyclus filtration is effected during reversal by an inhalant

 sieve-tube formed by the second antennae, with the participation of the third

 maxillipeds. In Albunea a similar tube is formed by the apposition of the first

antennw. lu Platyonichus nasutus, wbicli "burrows in coarse shell gravel, a
remarkable and characteristic prominence of the frontal area protects the anterior
apertures from the accidental intrusion of foreign hodies.

     It thus appears that many of the specitic and generic characteristics of

Crustacea, which have been hitherto regarded as features of trivial significance are
really of primary importance to their possessors under tlie particular conditions of

tlieir existence.

     It is both remarkable and interesting that the same function in relation to the
process of respiration should be discharged by organs and parts so dissimilar from
one another as are the first antennte of Albimea, the second antennre of Corystes,
the frontal area of Flutyonichus nasutus, the five lateral spines of the carapace of
Bathynectes, the nine lateral spines of Atelecyclus, the crests of the chelipeds of
Calappa grcmulata, and the orbits oi Matuta victor.

                                 [t'ommunicatecT by J. W. Woodall.]

     The Flodevigen Hatchery for Salt-water Fish was, at Captain Dannevig's
proposal, erected in 1888 by a private society in Arundal, with the object of
ascertaining whether it was possible to produce large numbers of fry of the better

class of salt-water fish at a reasonable cost, the decrease in the fisheries, especially
the cod fishing, being then greatly felt.

     The work commenced in February 1884, and, as neither methods nor service-
able apparatus were invented, the troubles at the beginning were great and many.

     Five millions of cod and nearly two millions of flounders and dabs were

hatched at a cost of about Is. M. per 1000 fry.

     The author gave details of the operations carried on from 1884 until the

present year.

  -- --During the later period 1890-96 1203 millions of fry were hatched at a cost

of 0Q5d. per 1000 fry. The last season the cost was one-third of a penny per
1000, and there is still a good chance of diminishing the expenses. The hatchery
cost about 800/., and the annual expenditure is about 500/.

     The practical result of the work is that the cod is rapidly increasing on the
south coast, and more especially where fry have been planted.

      8. On the Necessity for a British Fresh-tvater Biological Station.
                                By D. J. SCOURFIELD.

     Although there are fresh-water biological stations actively at work in Germany,
Bohemia, the United States, and other countries, the idea of founding such an

institution in this country has received very little attention. In fact the only

tangible proposal to found such a station appears to be that made by the Norfolk
and Norwich Naturalists' Society.' But surely it is time, now that the more
pressing need for British marine biological stations has bten largely satisfied, and

the anticipations as to their value are being steadily realised, to consider it the

careful study of fresh- water biology in this country cannot be helped forward by
the establishment of a properly equipped station. There can be no doubt that
many of the most intere.sting problems in fresh-water biology, problems of great
general importance bearing on vexed points of variation, heredity, selection, and
the infiuence of environment, will never be solved without the continuity of
observation which can practically only be secured by means of a station definitely
Avorking towards this end.

     Of the three principal districts in England and Wales offering suitable con-
ditions for a fresh-water station, viz., the Lake District, North Wales, and the
Norfolk Broads, the main work to be done in the two former would probably be
directed towards the fresh-water ' plankton,' while in the latter the influence of
the gradation from fresh to brackish water would be the most characteristic
feature. Many other lines of investigation could of course be followed in either
district, and the mere working-up of the aquatic fauna and flora of the immediately
surrounding neighbourhood, which is almost essential as a preliminary step to
deeper investigation, would be in itself no small gain to science.

     The minimum cost of an efficient fresh-water station would probably amount

to about 500/., and the cost of maintenance to 250/. a year ; for it is evident that if
the station is to be a success there must be at least one trained biologist to live
and work at it continuously.

832 REPORT-- 1896.

Compared with the large sums spent on marine biological stations, the amount

required for a fresh-water station, even if provided with a little more than the

minimum outfit, is evidently very modest, and it seems hardly necessary to advo-

cate the formation of a special society to carry out the proposal to found such a

Astation.  little co-operation on the part of the many existing institutions

interested in biology with a local society willing to undertake the work of organ-

isHtion and supervision seems to be all that is required. At least, so far as the

Norfolk Broads are concerned, this method would suffice, for there is the proposal

of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists' Society already in the tield, and it would

be a great pity if a scheme shoidd be allowed to fall through which, if carried out,

would remove the reproach that the United Kingdom is almost the only country

in Europe without a fresh-water biological station.

       By Pi'ofessor Charles S. Minot, Harvard University, Boston.

     The author reviews the series of theories which attribute essential general vital
functions to small particles, which maybe called life units, and are present rh large
numbers within a single cell. Such life units have been named Gemmules,
Physiological Units, Pangenes, Biophores, Plastidules, Ids, Idiosomes, &c. The
author regards all these theories as erroneous. They are to be looked upon as
little more than survivals of the old conception of absolute distinction between
living and non-living matter.

   The Theory of Panplasm supposes that all the materials by their interaction

                                                                i

    TRANSACTIONS OK SECTION D.  833

produce the vital plienomena of Protoplasm, and that therefore life can exist only
in Protoplasm of relatively large bulk, as compared with the hypothetical life
units. This view has experimental support. It also is in accordance with
Biitschli's foam theory of Protoplasm. All vital phenomena depend upon the
arrangement and composition of the multifarious constituents of Protoplasm. The
Theory of Panplasm, therefore, calls for a chemical explanation of Protoplasmatic

functions.

3. On Multiple Cell Division as compared ivitlu Bi-partition as Herbert
    Spencer's limit of growth. By Professor Marcus Hartog, M.A., D.Sc,

      F.L.S.

     Herbert Spencer showed that the growth of the cell without change of shape
necessarily reduced the area of surface in proportion to the mass, and gave this as
a sufficient explanation of ordinary cell-division. Another type of cell-division is
that in which successive divisions occur without any interval for growth ; such
divisions are variously known as Sporulation, Segmentation, and Brood formation,
but a more convenient term is ' multiple cell- formation.' This frequently occurs
determined by considerations of space ; as, for instance, when an elongated cell
rounds off, its superficial area is much reduced, and multiple cell-formation restores

the necessary ratio.

     Another case is that of a cell in which the food has been utilised largely for
the storage of reserve materials instead of for the growth of protoplasm. Judging

from what takes place in plants, we might anticipate that the protoplasm coidd

not utilise these materials without the previous formation of a zymose or chemical
ferment with which to render such reserves available for growth. This antici-
pation has been confirmed ; by appropriate methods the author has extracted a

peptonising zymose from the segmenting e§^ of the frog at a time when the
hypoblast was still visible through the blastopore ; and from the hen's embryo at

twenty-four hours, and from the e.xtravascular blastoderm at later stages. This
affords a key to multiple cell-formation in a large number of cases, where the
secretion of a ferment has, by an abundant food-supply, determined protoplasmic
growth at the expense of the reserves, and so determined the need for an extension

of surface.

   A probable deduction from this observation is that where reserves are to be

utilised by the containing-cell, the antecedent formation of a zymose is necessary,
and that digestion is a function, not of protoplasm, but of the ferments which

protoplasm may secrete.
     The zymoses obtained by the author from segmenting embryos were active in

neutral as well as in acid solution, and in this respect appear to differ from the
ferments observed in protozoa.

4 . The Present Position of Morphology in Zoological Science. By E. W.

     MacBride, M.A., Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge; Univer-
     sity Demonstrator of Animal Morphology.

     For some time back a distrust of the morphological method of studying
evolution has been growing up amongst zoologists. Alternative methods have
been suggested as more fruitful lines of research. These will be examined in the
first place to show that they labour from defects from which morphology is free ;
then the causes of the discontent with morphology will be inquired into ; and

finally some new points of view from which morphological facts may be regarded

will be put forward.

     The most important alternative methods which have been put forward are

three :

     1. Mechanics of development or experimental embryology.

process liiiown as develoiiment, and it is sliown that the organs of the adult are
not traceable back into definite areas of the ovum, or even blastula. So far as it
goes, this is a most valuable kind of dissection ; but it does not touch the question

of how the hereditary powers of animals may be altered and so congenital inherit-

able variations produced ; and this is the main problem of zoology.
     2. The study of individual variations.
     The drawbacks to this method are

     («) It is often quite impossible to distinguish a congenital variation from a
variation produced in the particular individual examined by some accident in the

environment.

    (b) Many of the most conspicuous variations are shown by a study of specific

and generic characters to have had no part in the evolutionary process.
     (c) It is not enough that a variation should occur ; it must occur in a sufficient

number of individuals to prevent its being immediately swamped by intercrossing.

3. The statistical study of individual variations or mathematical zoology.
The drawbacks to this method are^--

     (a) It is only capable of application to one character at a time, and a character
is only a mental abstraction ; natural selection acts on the balance of all the

characters.

    {b) Even if we could establish that a certain value of a given character was
accompanied by a low death rate, and that therefore this value was likely to

become a specific character, the success of its possessors might be due to some
obscure constitutional change associated with it.

     (c) But the only way it is possible to get such a result is to compare the

variations with respect to a particular character of young and fully adult animals.
To attribute the lesser number of deviations from the mean in the latter ease to
the death of individuals which had widely varied is to overlook the possibility of
a self-regulatiug tendency in growth.

     The reason of the discontent with the morphological method is that it proves
too much, i.e., the most contradictory conclusions may be drawn from the same

premisses, for

     («) Evolution is not only a progress from the simple to the complex ; degene-
racy or simplification of structure plays an important part, and so also does

homoplasy or parallel development, the evolution of similar structures in different

animals independently.

(b) It has been customary to postulate modifications as part of evolutionary

history, the  utility of which  is  to  be  taken  on  faith                          and if this  principle be
                                                                                   ;

admitted, the evolutionary theorist can, armed with progressive degeneracy, as

well as progressive differentiation, derive any one animal from any other.

Suggestions as to better ways of dealing with morphological facts:

    1. There are many cases where the fact that a certain modification has taken

place is doubted by no one ; for instance, no one seriously doubts that Teredo and
Pecten have been derived from the ordinary Lamellibranch type.

     The evolutionary changes which can be deduced from such cases as these are
really the data the morphologist has to go on ; if he departs from these he is on
unsafe ground. It is possible that by a comparative study of such cases, ' laws of
evolution ' might be formulated.

     2. In relation to the question of how degenerate and primitive structures are

--to be distinguished, we have to consider two subsidiary questions :

     («) Does the fact that an animal is obviously degenerate in some points

invalidate any conclusions that may be arrived at as to its general primitive

character ?

     {(/) Can an animal which has descended to a degenerate mode of life give rise to

highly organised descendants ?

     The answer to the first question is that all animals which in their general
organisation are primitive are likewise degenerate, since they have by their
degeneracy escaped competition with their more highly organised relatives.

    Amount of modification is an ambif^uous term, and covers two distinct varieties

of evolution:

     (i.) Increase in differentiation of organs fulfilling the main functions (nervous,
muscular, circulatory, and reproductive organs, for instance), correlated with

greater intensity of metabolism.
     (ii.) Modification of shape, size, and external organs.

     (i.) is regarded by most zoologists as the essence of progressive evolution.
The lesser value assigned to (ii.) justifies the separation of the Thylacine
and Dog.

     The answer to the second question is, so far as can be inferred from data laid
down above, in the negative.

     Hence it is not legitimate to assume that Vertebrata are directly descended
from Balanoglossus or even Amphioxus.

    On the main question as to the criteria of primitive and degenerate cha-

racters. Primitive structures are synthetic in nature ; they either serve to link
together different groups, as the flat foot of Nucula connects Gastropods and
Lamellibranchs, or different organs, as the ccelom of the lower Annelids and of

Brachiopods unites the functions of the renal and reproductive organs ; for new

organs have not arisen de novo from functionless rudiments, but by the modifica-

tion of pre-existing organs.

     Degenerate structures do not recall structures of other groups, and their con-
dition does not correspond to the evolutionary level deducible from the condition
of the other organs of the body.

     Example : Rudimentary limbs of certain Urodeles.

     3. One of the most vexed questions in zoology is the value to be attached to
ontogeny as a record of phylogeny. Some have denied that it has any such
value, but cases exist where the phylogenetic value is simply undeniable.

     It is highly improbable that ontogeny is a process of an essentially different
nature in different cases ; therefore there is probably a phylogenetic element in

all ontogeny.

    Many features in embryology are, as all admit, secondary.
     The key to the puzzle is that the embryo is a modified larva, and that the

larva recapitulates not primarily ancestral structure but

      («) Ancestral habits.

     (6) Ancestral level of differentiation of functions, and ancestral structure so
far as is demanded by these conditions.

     4. In relation to the question as to how far homoplasy interferes with the
conclusions we are accustomed to base on similarity of structure, it must be

admitted that parallel development has not only taken place in widely separated
groups, where there is no danger of confusion, but again and again in narrow
circles of affinity ; the researches of modern systematists seem to show that it is

the normal thing. Instances of this, Arion and Limax amongst Pulmouata, &c.

Criticism of the conception of identity of ancestry.

We do not mean that animals belonging to different families are ultimately

Wedescended from the same pair.  mean only from ancestors so similar as to have

b3en able to pair with one another, or in other words belonging to same species.

Species are, however, often separated by trivial marks, so far as we can see,

of a non-adaptive character. It is a gratuitous assumption that similaritj' in

broad outlines of structure which are adaptive indicates descent from same

species.

     Closely allied species exposed to same environmental influence would undergo
the same change ; descent from same species is only the extreme term in a series
in which there is a gradual passage from what would be called homology to

undeniable homoplasy. Structural resemblance indicates not primarily identity

of ancestry, but similarity of past environment ; and there may be all degrees

in this similarity, both in extent and duration.

    A conclusion like this is tacitly admitted by systematists who make the basis

of their system minute and apparently unimportant peculiarities of external form.

colour, or arrangement of similar organs ; it is, however, the origin and history of
adaptations which interest the morphologist, and his task must be, not primarily
to draw up genealogical trees, but to correlate these adaptations as far as possible
to the external conditions which have caused them.

       By Professor Charles S. Minot, Harvard University, Boston.

     The author reports observations on the stratification and on the cell forms to
be found in the developing and mature olfactory lobes, and deduces the con-
clusion that the lobes must be regarded as modifications of the cortex cerebri.

He also emphasises the fact that the form of the cells of the cerebral cortex is

extremely variable, so that the current descriptions, especially of the pyramidal
cells, are really more or less conventionalised. Tliese variations greatly facilitate
the comparison of the cells of the cortex proper with those of the olfactory lobe.

              By Professor Marcus Hartog, M.A., D.Sc, F.L.S.

     The author gave reasons for regarding the usually accepted aftiuities of the
Rotifera to the Trochophore as due to similarity of conditions and to no more

morphological identity. He regards the l\(3tifera as primitively aproctous, and

suggests that the anus has been formed by the fusion of the blind end of the gut
with a genito-urinary cloaca. This is indicated by the absence of the anus in the
males of most Rotifers and the females of one family. Again, while the anus of
the Trochophore is formed from part of the blastoporal area, the proctodseum in
Eotifera is formed outside this area. The author regards the Rotifera as corre-
sponding with Pilidum, in which the apical organ has been transformed into glands
for attachment, as occurs in the larva of certain Echinoderms. All the orientation
of the Rotifera is, according to this view, comparable with that of tlie cuttlefish.
' Anterior ' and ' posterior ' become replaced by oral and apical ends, * dorsal
and ' ventral ' by anterior and posterior, while right and left are unchanged.

     By new methods and a new application of old methods (which are described in

the 'Journal of the Royal Statistical Society ' for June 1896) the writer confirms
the conclusion formerly obtained, that the average duration of a wasp's absence
from the nest is about a quarter of an hour in the evening. But for the daytime
the average duration of a voyage is considerably longer.

                    Section E.--GEOGRAPHY.

       --President op the Section Major Darwin, Sec. R.G.S.

                        THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.

The President delivered the following Address :

In reviewing the record of geographical work during the past year, all other

performances pale in comparison with the feat accomplished by Nansen, It is not

merely that he has gone considerably nearer the North Pole than any other
explorer, it is not only that he has made one of the most courageous expeditions

ever recorded, but he has established the truth of his theory of Polar currents,

and has brought back a mass of valuable scientific information. When Nansen
comes to England I am certain that we shall give him a reception which will prove

how much we admire the heroism of this brave Norwegian.

Besides the news of this most remarkable achievement, the results of a con-

siderable amount of useful exploratory work have been published since the British
Association met last at Ipswich. With regard to other Arctic Expeditions, we

have had the account of Lieutenant Peary's third season in Northern Greenland,

from which place he came back in September last, and to which he has again

returned, though without the intention of passing another winter there. In

October the ' Windward ' brought home more ample information as to the progress

of the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition than that communicated by telegram to the

Association at Ipswich, and on her return from her remarkably rapid voyage this sum-

mer she brought back the record of another year. As to geographical work in Asia,
Mr. and Mrs. Littledale returned safely from their explorations of the little knowr

parts of Tibet; the Pamir Boundary Commission, under Colonel Holdich, has

collected a great deal of accurate topographical information in the course of its

labours ; Dr. Sven Hedin continues his important researches in Turkestan ; and
the Royal Geographical Society was glad to welcome Prince Henry of Orleans

when he came to tell us about his journey near the sources of the Irrawaddy. As

to Africa, the most important additions to our knowledge of that continent are

due to the French surveyors, who have accurately mapped the recently discovered

series of lakes in the neighbourhood of Timbuktu, Lake Faguibine, the largest,

being found to be 68 miles in length ; Dr. Donaldson Smith has filled up some

large  blanks  in  the  map  of Somaliland                                                                    and  Mr.  and Mrs.  Theodore  Bent  have
                                                                                                           ;

investigated some interesting remains of ancient gold wcrkings inland of the Red

Sea. In other parts of the world less has been done, because there is less to do.

Mr. Fitzgerald has proved for the first time the practicable character of a pas?

across the Southern Alps, thus supplementing the excellent work of Mr. Harper

and otlier pioneers of the New Zealand Alpine Club ; and Sir W. M. Conway has

commenced a systematic exploration of the interior of Spitzbergen, a region to

which the attention of several other geographers is also directed.

amount of vahiable and useful work which is being done in many quarters of the

world. It is true that if we compare this record with the record of years gone by

we find a marked diflerence. Then, there was always some great geographical

problem to be attacked :                                                                                   the sources of the      Nile  had to be discovered                                                                                 the course

the imagination of explorers with the thought of all sorts of possibilities. Now,
though there is much to be learned, yet, with the e.xception of the Poles, the work

will consist in filling in the details of the picture, the general outlines being all

drawn for us already. Personally I cannot help feeling a completely unreasoning
regret that we have almost passed out of the heroic period of geography. What-
ever the future may have in store for us, it can never give us another Columbus,

another Magellan, or another Livingstone. Tlie geographical discoverers of the

future will win their fame in a more prosaic fashion, though their work may in

reality be of even greater service to mankind. There are now few places in the
world where the outline of tlie main topographical features is unknown ; but, on the

other hand, there are vast districts not yet thoroughly examined. And, in examin-
ing thpse more or less known localities, geographers must take a far wider view

than heretofore of their methods of study in order to accommodate themselves to
modern conditions.

    But even if we confine our attention to the older and more narrow field of

geography, it will be seen that there is still an immense amount of work to be
Wedone.
                              have been filling in the map of Africa during recent years with

extraordinary rapidity, but yet that map is likely to remain in a very unsatisfactory

condition for a long time to come. Englishmen and other Europeans have always
shown themselves to be ready to risk their lives in exploring unknown regions, but

we have yet to see how readily they will undertake the plodding work of recording
topographical details when little renown is to be won by their eflx)rts. It should

be one of the objects of geographical societies to educate the public to recognise

the importance of this work, and General Chapman deserves great credit for bring-

ing the matter before the International Congress last year in such a prominent

manner. He confined himself to four main recommendations : (Ij The extension

of accurate topographical surveys in regions likely to be settled by Europeans.
(2) The encouragement of travellers to sketch areas rather than routes. (3) The
study of astronomical observations already taken in the unsurveyed parts of Africa

in a systematic manner, and the publication of the results. (4) The accurate

determination of the latitude and longitude of many important places in unsuneyed
Africa. I am certain that all geographers are in hearty accord with General
Chapman in his views, and it is, perhaps, by continually bringing this matter before
the public that we shall best help this movement forward.

    Not only do we want a more accurate filling in of the picture, but we have yet

to learn to read its lessons aright. The past cannot be understood, and still less

can the future be predicted, without a wider conception of geographical facts.

Look, for example, at the European colonies on the West Coast of Africa. Here
we fiudj:hat there have been Portuguese settlements on the Gold Coast since the

year 1471, the French possibly having been established there at an even earlier

date                          whilst we English, who pride                                                         ourselves on our go-ahead character, have had
                           ;

trading factories on the Coast since 1667. I have here a map showing the state of

our geographical knowledge in 1815. Why was it that Europeans have never,

broadly speaking, pushed into the interior from their base on the coast, which they

had occupied for so many centuries ? That they had not done so, at least to any
Whypurpose, is proved by this map.
                                                                                                                   had four centuries of contact with Europeans

done so little even for geographical knowledge at that time ? The answer to this
question may be said to be mainly historical ; but the history of our African

colonies can never be understood without a study of the distribution of the dense

belt of unhealthy forest along the shore ; of the distribution of the diff"erent types

of  native                    inhabitants                                                                  and of  the courses of  the   navigable rivers, all  strictly geo-

     Geography is the study of distribution, and early in that studj' we must be
Blruck with the correlation of these different distributions. If we take a map of
Africa, and mark on it all the areas within the tropics covered with dense forest
or scrub, we shall find we have drawn a map showing accurately the distribution
of the worst types of malarial fever ; and that we have also indicated with some

-- --approach to accuracy with, however, notable exceptions the habitat of the lowest

types of mankind. These are the facts which give the key to understanding why
the progress of European colonisation on the West Coast has been so slow.

     Along the coast of the Gulf of Guinea we find settlements of Europeans at
more or less distant intervals. All along, or nearly all along, this same coast we

find a wide belt of fever-stricken forest, fairly thickly inhabited by uncivilised
Nearo and Bantu tribes. Inside this belt of forest the country rises in altitude,
and becomes more open, whilst at the same time there is a distinct improvement
in the type of native ; and the more we proceed inland, the more marked does this
improvement become. There appear in fact to have been a number of waves of
advancing civilisation, each one pressing the one in front of it towards these
inhospitable forest belts. Near the Coast the lowest type of Negro is, generally
speaking, to be found ; then, as the more open country is reached, higher types of
Negroes are encountered : for example, the Mandingoes of the Senegal region are
distinctly higher than the Jolas inhabiting the mouths of the Gambia : and the
Hausas of the Sokoto Empire are vastly superior to the cannibals of the Oil Rivers.
In both these cases the higher types are probably not pure Negroes, but have Fulah,

Berber, or Arab blood in their veins ; for we see, in the case of the Fulahs, how

they become absorbed into the race they are conquering; near the Senegal River

they are comparatively light in colour, but in Adamawa they are hardly to be dis-

tinguished by their features from the negroes they despise. Thus the process
appears to have been a double one ; the higher race driving some of the lower
aboriginal tribes before them out of the better lands, and, at the same time, raising
other tribes by means of an admixture of better blood. These waves of advancing

civilisation seem to have advanced from the north and east, for the more we pene-
trate in these directions, the higher is the type of inhabitant met with, until at
last we reach the pure Berbers and the pure Arabs. Thus there are two civilising

--influences visible in this part of Africa : one coming from the north and east
--Mahommedan advance which keeps beating up against this forest belt and occa-

sionally breaking into it ; the other, a Christian movement, which, until the
middle of this century, was brought to a dead halt by this same obstacle. The

map of Africa, showing the state of geographical knowledge in 1815, makes it clear

that, except in a few cases where rivers helped travellers through these malarial

regions, nothing was known about the interior. No doubt much has been done

since those days, but this barrier still remains the great impediment to progress

from the West Coast ; and those who desire our influence to spread more efl'ec-

tively into the interior must wish to see some means of overcoming this obstacle.

On the East Coast of Africa the conditions are somewhat different, as there is

comparatively little den.se forest there ; but the districts near that coast are also

usually unhealthy, and how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy

or less nnhealthy interior is the most important problem connected with the

development of Tropical Africa.
     Other influences have been at work, no doubt, in checking our progress from

the West Coast. In old days the European possessions in these districts were
mere depots for the export of slaves. As the white residents could not hope to
compete with the natives in the actual work of catching these unfortunate creatures,
and as the lower the type the more easily were they caught, as a rule, there was
no reason whatever for attempting to penetrate into the interior, where the higher
types are met with. But, though this export trade in human beings is now no

longer an impediment to progress, the slave trade in the intei-ior still helps to bar

the way. When the forest belt is passed, we now come, generally speaking, to the
line of demarcation between the Mahommedan and the Pagan tribes, and here slave
catching is generally rife ; when it is so, the constant raids of the Mahommedan
chiefs keep these border districts in a state of unrest which in every way tends to

"mpede progress. Thus a mere advance to the liiglier ialand regions will not by
any means solve all our difKculties ; but it will greatly lessen them ; and it is

universally admitted that the more communication with the interior is facilitated,

the more easy will it be to suppress this terrible tratKc in human beings. By the

General Act of the Brussels Anti-Slaveiy Conference of 1890-91, it was agreed by

the assembled delegates that the construction of roads, and, in particular, of rail-

ways, connecting the advanced stations with the coast, and permitting easy access

to the inland waters, and to the upper courses of rivers, was one of the most eflec-

tive means of counteracting the slave trade in the interior. Here, then, we have

the most formal admission which could be given of the necessity of opening up

main trunk lines of communication into the interior.

But not only does geographical knowledge help to demonstrate the necessity of

improving the means of communication between the coast and the interior, but it

helps us to decide where it is wise to make our first eilbrts in this direction. In

the first place, it is essential to note that if the Continent of Africa is compared

with other Continents, its general poverty is clearly seen. Mr. Keltie, in his excel-
lent work on the Partition of Africa, tells us that ' at present (1895) it is estimated

that the total exports of the whole of Central Africa by the east and west coast do

not amount to more than 20,000,000/. sterling annually.' For the purposes of com-
parison it may be mentioned that the export trade of India is between sixty and

seventy millions sterling annually, and that India is only about one-seventh or

one-eighth of the area of the whole of Africa. On the other hand, the trade of

India has been increasing by leaps and bounds, largely in consequence of the

country being opened out by railways, and there is every reason to hope that some-
what .similar results would occur in Africa under similar circumstances, though

the lower civilization of the people would prevent the harvest being so quickly

reaped. But, however it may be as to the future, the present poverty of Africa is

enough to demonstrate the necessity of pushing ahead cautiously and steadily, and

of doing so in the most economical manner possible.

j\I. Decle, in an interesting paper, read before the International Geographical

Congress in London last year, strongly advocated the construction of cheap roads

for u.se by the natives, taking precautions to prevent any traffic in slaves along

them. His suggestions are well worthy of consideration ; but the cost of transport
along any road would, I should have thought, soon have eaten up any profits on

the import or export trade to or from Africa. AVhat must be done in the first

instance is to utilise to the utmost all the natural lines of communication which

require little or no expenditure to render them serviceable ; in fact, to turn our

attention at first to the rivers and to the lakes. I have already pointed out that

the early maps of Africa prove that the rivers have almost invariably been the first

means of communication with the interior, and until this continent is rich enough

to support an extensive railway system, we must rely largely on the waterways as
means of transport.

It may be as well here to remark that geographical knowledge is often required

in order to control the imagination. I do not know why it is, but almost everyone

will admit that if he sees a lake of considerable size depicted on a map, he immedi-

Aately feels a desire to visit or possess that locality in preference to others.  lake

may be of far less commercial value than an equal length of thoroughly navigable

river, and yet it will always appear more attractive. Look at the way in which

the English, the French, and the Germans are all pressing forward to Lake Chad
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and ye^ Lake Chad is in reality not much more than a huge swamp, and, in all pro-

bability, it is excessively unhealthy. Again, it is probable that the Albert Nyanza

will prove to be of comparatively small value, because the mountains come down so

cl'^se to its shores. Of course, the great lakes form an immensely important feature

in African geography, but we must j udge their commercial value rationally, and

without the bias of imagination.

To develop the traffic along the rivers and on the lakes is the first stage in the

commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But it cannot carry us very

far. Africa is badly supplied with navigable rivers, chiefly as a natural result

of the general formation of the land. The continent consists, broadly speaking,

of a Luge plateau, and the rivers flowing off this plateau are obstructed by

--cataracts in exactly the places where we most want to use them that is, when

approaching the coasts. The second stage in the commercial evolution will

therefore be the construction of railways with the view of supplementing this

river traffic. Finally, no doubt, a further stage will be reached, when railways

will cut out the rivers altogether; for few of the navigable rivers are really well

suited to serve as lines of communication. This last stage is, however, so far oft"

that we may neglect it for the present ; though it must be noted that there are

some parts of Africa where there are no navigable rivers, and where, if anything

is to be done, it must be entirely by means of railways.

Thus, as far as the immediate future is concerned, the points to which our

attention should be mainly directed are (1) the courses of the navigable parts of
the rivers, and (2; the routes most suitable for the construction of railways in

order to connect the navigable rivers and lakes with the coast. As to the

navigable rivers, little more remains to be discovered with regard to them, and

we can indicate the state of our geographical knowledge on this point with

sufficient accuracy for our purposes by means of a map. Of course the commercial

value of a waterway depends greatly on the kind of boats which can be used, and

that point cannot well be indicated cartographically.

    As to the railways, we must study the physical features of the country

through which the proposed  lines of                                                  communication would  pass.  AJl tlie
                                                                                   ,

obstacles on rival routes should be most carefully surveyed when considering

the construction of railways in an economical manner. Great mountain chains

are seldom met witli iu Africa, end from that point of view the continent is as a

whole remarkably free from difficulties. But drifting sand is often a serious
trouble, and that is met with commonly enough in many parts. Wide tracks of

rocky country also form serious impediments, both because of the cost of con-

struction, and also because the supply of water for the engines becomes a problem

not to be neglected. Such arid and sandy districts are of course thinly in-

habited, and we may therefore generally conclude that where the population i;i

scanty, there railway engineers will have special difficulties to face. On the

Weother hand, dense forests are also very unsuitable.                                 have not much ex-

perience to guide us, hut it would appear probable that the initial expense of

clearing the forest, and the cost of maintenance, in perpetually battling against

the tropical vegetable growth, will be very heavy; for it will not do to allow the

line to be in constant danger of being blocked. The dampness of the forest,

which will cause all woodwork and wooden sleepers to rot, will be no small

source of trouble, .and the virulent malarial fevers, always met with where the

vegetation is very rank, will add immensely to the difficulty both of construction

and of maintenance. The health of the European nnployh will be a most serious

question in considering the construction of railways in all parts of tropical Africa,

for the turning up of the soil is the most certain of all methods of causing au

outbreak of malarial fever ; and the evil results would be most severely felt in
constructing ordinary railways in dense forests. In making the short Senegal
railway, where the climate is healthier than in many of the districts further
south, the mortality was very great. Perhaps we shall liave to modify our usual

methods of construction so as to mitigate this danger, and, in connection with

this subject, I may perhaps mention that the Lartigue system seems to be specially

--worthy of consideration a system by which the train is carried on a single ele-

vated rail. This is perhaps travelling rather wide of the mark of ordinary geo-

graphical studies, but it illustrates the necessity of a thorough examination of

the environment before we try to transplant our own methods to other climes.
    We may, however, safely conclude that we must as far as possible avoid

both dense forests and sandy and rocky wastes in the construction of our first

railways.

     Then, as to the lines of communication, considered as a whole, rail and river

combined, we must obviously, if any capital is to be expended, make them in the

directions most likely to secure a profitable traffic. In considering this part of the

question, it will be seen that there are several diffi;rent problems to be discussed :
                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                                                                                                                                                                                            843

settlers. To many minds the last of these problems will appear to be the mcst

important, and in the end it may prove to be so. But the time at my disposal

compels me to limit myself to the consideration of trade with the existing native

races within the tropics, with only an occasional reference to the influence of white

residents. AVe must, no doubt, carefully consider which are the localities most

likely to attract those Europeans who go to Africa with the view of establishing

commercial intercourse and commercial methods in the interior ; and there can be

no doubt that considerations of health will play a prominent part in deciding

this point. Moreover, as the lowest types of natives have few wants, the more

primitive the inhabitants of the districts opened up, the less will be the probability

of a profitable trade being established, for both these reasons the coast districts

are not likely in the end to be as good a field for commercial enterprise as the

higher lands in the interior; for the more we recede from the coast, the less

unhealthy the country becomes, and the more often do we find traces of native

civilisation. To put it simply, we must consider both the density of the population

and the class of inhabitant in the districts proposed to be opened up. Of course,

the exact nature of the products likely to be exported, and the probability of

demands for European goods arising amongst the natives of different districts, are

vitally important considerations in estimating the profits of any proposed line of

railway ; but to discuss such problems in commercial geography at length would

open up too wide a field on an occasion like this.

If the importance of considering the density of the population in the difierent

districts in such a preliminary survey is admitted, we may then simplify our

inquiry by decliniug to discuss any lines of communication intended to open up

--regions where the population falls below some fixed minimum whatever we may

like to decide on. Of course, the question of the greater or less probabihty of a

locality attracting white temporary residents is very important, but unless there is

-a native population ready to work on, there will be little done for many years to
come. Politicalh' it may or may not be right to open up new districts by railways

am considering the best lines for the development of commerce, takmg things as

they are. "What then shall be this minimum of population ? The population of

Bengal is 470 per square mile ; of India, as a whole, about 180 ; and of the United

States, about 21 or 22. If it is remembered that the inhabitants of the United

States are, per head, vastly more trade-producing than the natives of Africa, it will

be admitted that we may for the present exclude from our survey all districts in

which the population does not reach a minimum of 8 per square mile ; it might be

right to put the minimum much higher than this. On the map now before you,

the uncoloured parts show where the density of population does not come up

to this minimum, and we can see at a glance how enormously this reduces the area

to be considered. The light pink indicates a population of from 8 to 32 per square

mile, and the darker pink a denser population than that. Of course, such a map,

in the very imperfect state of our knowledge, must be very inaccurate, as I am

sure the compiler would be the first to admit. On the same map are marked the

navigable parts of rivers. I should like to have shown the dense forests also, but

the difliculty of giving them with any approach to correctness is at present

insuperable.

    Here, then, is the kind of map we want in order to consider the broad outline

of the questions connected with the advisability of attempting to push lines of

communication into the interior. The problem is how to connect the inland parts
of Africa, which are coloured pink on this map, with the coast, by practicable lines
of communications, at the least cost, with the least amount of dense forest to be

traversed, and, in the case of railways, whilst avoiding as far as possible all thinly
populated districts.

      It is of course quite impossible here to discuss all the great routes into the

interior, and I sJiould like to devote the remaining time at my disposal to the
--844 REPORT 1896.

consideration of this problem as far as a few of .the most important districts are

concerned, confining myself, as I have said, to trade with existing- native races

within the tropics. Taking: the East Coast first, and beginning at the north, the

first reg-ion sufficiently populous to attract our attention is the Valley of the Nile,

and parts of the Central Sudan. Wadai, Darfur, and Kordofan are but scantily

inhabited, according to our map, and this is probably the case now that the

Khalifa has so devastated these districts ; but, without doubt, much of this country

could support a teeming population, and is capable of great commercial develop-

ment. The Bahr-el-Gliazal districts are especially attractive, being fertile and

better watered than the somewhat arid regions further north. These remarks

remind me how difficult it is at this moment to touch on this subject without
trenching on politics. Few will deny that the sooner this region is connected

with the civilised world the better, and it is only as to the method of opening it

up, and as to who is to undertake the work, that burning political questions will

arise. The geographical problems connected with the lines of communication to

the interior can be considered whilst leaviug these two points quite on one side.

   A glance at the map reminds us of the well-known fact that, below Berber,

the Nile is interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, whilst above that

town there is a navigable water-way at high Nile until the Fola rapids are reached,

a distance of about 1,400 miles, not to mention the 400 to 600 miles of the Blue

Nile and the Bahr-el-Gazal, which are also navigable. The importance of a rail-

way from Suakin to Berber is thus at once evident, and there is perhaps only one

other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large tract

of country to European trade. This route, however, is not free from difficulties.

Suakin is hot and unhealthy. Then the railway, about 260 miles in length, passes

over uninhabited or thinly inhabited districts the whole way. Though the hills

over which it would pass are of no great height, the highest part of the track

being under 3,000 feet above the sea, it is often said that the desert to be

traversed would add greatly to the difficulty of construction. According to

Lieut.-Colonel Watson, R.E., however, these difficulties have been greatly exag-

gerated, for the water supply would give no great trouble. The sixth cataract,

between Metemma and Khartum, would make navigation for commercial purposes

impossible when the waters are low ; it is probable that this impediment could be

overcome by erecting locks, but it is impossible to estimate the cost of such works.

Then, again, the Nile above Khartum is much obstructed by floating grass or sudd,

making navigation at times almost impossible                                                                                                                                                                                                                  but it was Gordon's opinion that  a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

line of steamers on the river, even if running at rare intervals, would keep the

course of the stream clear ; this, however, remains to be proved.

If the canalisation of the sixth cataract should prove to be too costly an under-

taking, then it would be most advisable to carry on the railway beyond that

obstacle. This might be done by prolonging the line along the banks of the Nile,

or by adopting an entirely different route from Suakin through Kassala. I hope

we shall hear something from Sir Charles AVilson as to the relative merits of

these proposals during the course of our proceedings. Proposals have also been

made for connecting the Nile with other ports on the Red Sea, and all of these

suggestions should be carefully examined before a decision is made as to the exact

route to be adopted. But in any case, considering the matter merely from a

--geographical standpoint, and putting politics on one side a very large omission
--in the case of the Sudan it would appear that one or other of these routes

should be one of the very first to be constructed in all Africa.

Passing further south, it is obvious from the configuration of the shore, and

from the distribution of the population, that the lines of communication next to

be considered are those leading to the "Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying

north and west of the lake.

Two routes for railways from the coast to the Victoria Nyanza have been pro-

posed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere

of influence. Looking at the matter from a strictly geographical point of view,

there is perhaps hardly sufBcient information to enable us to judge of the relative

merits of the two proposals. Both run through an unhealthy coast zone, and
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  845

both traverse thinly inhabited districts until the lake is reached. The German
route, as oripiually proposed, would be the shorter of the two ; but there is some
reason to think that the British line -will open up more country east of tlie lake,
which will be suitable for prolonged residence by white men. Sir John Kirk, in

discussing the question of the possible colonisation of tropical Africa by Europeans,
said : ' These uplands vary from 6,000 to 7,000 feet in height, the climate is cool,
and, as far as known, very healthy for Europeans. This district is separated from
the coast by the usual unhealthy zone, which, however, is narrower than elsewhere
on the African littoral. Between the coast zone .and the highlands stretches a

barren belt of country, which attains a maximum width of nearly 200 miles. The

rise is gradual, and throughout the whole area to be crossed the climate is drier
and the malarial diseases are certainly much less frequent and less severe than in

the regions further south.' These very advantages, however, may have to be

paid for by the greater difficulty of railway construction. Putting aside future

prospects, the map shows that the populous region to the west of the lake makes
either of these proposed lines well worthy of consideration, though it would
perhaps be rash to predict how soon the commerce along them would pay for the
interest on the capital expended. "What will be the fate of the German project I
do not know, but we may prophecy with some confidence that the British line, the
construction of which has been commenced, will be completed sooner or later.

   --The two lines of communication we have discussed the Suakin and the Victoria

--Nyanza routes are intended to supply the wants of widely separated districts ; but,

looking' to a more distant future, they must sooner or later come into competition
one with the other, in attracting trade from the Central Sudan. Before this can
occur, communication by steamboat and by railway must be opened up between the
coast and the navigable Nile by both routes. This will necessitate a railway being

constructed, not only to the Victoria Nyanza, but also from that lake, or round it, to
the Albert Nyanza ; and, as the Nile is rendered unnavigable by cataracts about Du-
file, and as the navigation is difficult between Dufile and Lado, here also a railway
would be necessary in order to complete the chain of steam communication with

the coast. If goods were brought across the Victoria Nvanza by steamer, and taken
down the Nile in the same manner from the Albert Nyanza to Dufile, this route

would necessitate bulk being broken six times before the merchandise was under way

on the Nile ; by the Suakin route, on the other hand, bulk would only have to be
broken twice, provided the sixth cataract were rendered navigable. Thus, if this

latter difficulty can be overcome, and if the sudd on the Nile is not found to
impede navigation very much, this Nyanza route will certainly not compete with

the Suakin route for any trade on the banks of the navigable Nile until a railway
is made from the coast to Lido, a distance of over 800 miles as the crow flies, and

certainly over 1,000 miles by rail. It must be remembered also that the Nyanza

route passes over mountains 8,700 feet above the sea ; that the train will have to
mount, in all, nearly 13,000 feet in the course of its journey from the coast; and

that a difficult gorge has to be crossed to the eastward of the Victoria Nyanza.

From these facts Ave may conclude that it will be a very long time before the
Nyanza route will draw any trade from the Central Sudan.

     The line through the British sphere of influence runs to the northern end of

Victoria Nvanza, but from Mr. Vandeleur's recent expedition into these regions we

learn that a shorter route, striking the eastern shore of the lake, is under considera-

tion. To lessen the expense of construction would be a great boon, but if we look
to the more ambitious schemes for the future, something may be said in favour of

the original proposal as being better adapted to form part of a line of railway
reaching the navigable Nile.

     With regard to the comparison between the German and British routes to the
Victoria Nyanza, the latest accounts seem to imply that the Germans have prac-
tically decided on a line from the coast to Ujiji, with a branch from Tabora to the
Victoria Nyanza. This would be a most valuable line of communication ; but it
seems a pity that capital should be expended in competitive routes when there are
so many other directions in which it is desirable to open up the continent. If the
Germans wish to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a
846 REPORT-- 1896.

line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyasa,
and thence on to the coast ; they would thus open up a vast extent of territory,

and Baron von Scheie tells us that a particularly easy route can be found from

Kilva to the lake. Such a line of communication, especially if eventually con-
nected with the Victoria Nyanza to the north, would be more valuable than any
other line in Africa in putting an end to the slave trade, as it would make it pos-

sible to erect a great barrier, as it were, running north and south across the roads

traversed by the slave traders.

   A line through German territory connecting Lake Nyasa with the sea would, no

doubt, come into competition with the route connecting the southern end of that
lake with the Zambesi, and thus with the coast. The mouths of the Zambesi,
though they are passable, will always present some impediment to commerce. But

after entering the river navigation is not obstructed until the Murchison Rapids on

the Shire River are reached. Here there are at present sixty miles of portage to be

traversed, and this transit must be facilitated by the construction of a railway, if this

route is to be properly developed ; Mr. Scott Elliot tells us that 120 miles of railway,
from Chiromo to Matope, would be necessary for this purpose. Beyond this latter

point there is a good waterway to Lake Nyasa. Thus a comparatively short line of

railway would open up this lake to European commerce, and this route is likely to

be developed at a much earlier stage of the commercial evolution of Africa than the

one through German territory above suggested. It will be seen that these routes

connect fairly populous districts with the coast, and it must also be recollected

that the high plateau between Lake Nyasa and the Kafue River is one of the very
few regions in tropical Africa likely to attract white men as more or less perma-

nent residents.

    Further south we come to the Zambesi River, which should, of course, he

utilised as far as possible. But this line of communication to the interior has
many faults. The difficulties to be met with at the mouths of the Zambesi have

already been alluded to. Then the whole valley is unhealthy, and white travellers

would prefer any route which would bring them on to high land more quickly.

Moreover the Kebrabasa rapids cause a serious break in the waterway, and, as the

river above that point is only navigable for canoes, it is doubtful if it would ever

he worth making a railway for the sole purpose of connecting these two portions

of the river.

    As the population of the upper Zambesi valley is considerable, and as the

country further from its banks is said to be likely to he attractive to white men,

there can be no doubt of the advisability of connecting it Avith the coast. This

naturally leads us to consider the Beira route, as a possible competitor with the

AZambesi.   sixty centimetre railway is now open from Fontesvilla to Chimoio

(190 kilometres), and it is probable that during the course of the next two years

the construction of the railway will be completed from the port of Beira itself as

far aa the territory of the Chartered Company. This will form the first step in the
construction of a much better line of communication to the Upper Zambesi regions

than that afforded by the river itself. It is true that the gauge is very narrow, and

that the first part of the line passes through very unhealthy districts ; but this line
will nevertheless be a most valuable addition to the existing means of penetrating

into the interior of the continent. It is needless to say that the object of this

railway is to open up communications with Mashonaland, not for the purposes now

suggested.

    South of the Zambesi the map shows us that there are no regions in tropical
Africa where the density of the native population reaches the minimum of eight
per square mile. Here, however, we come to the gold fields, where there is
attractive force enough to draw white men in great numbers within the tropics,

and where, no doubt, some of the most important problems connected with railway

communications will have to be solved in the immediate future. But, for reasons of

time and space, I have limited myself to the discussion of districts within the tropics,

where trade with the existing native races is the object in view. The Beira

railway does not in reality come within the limits I have imposed on myself,

into competition one with the other. But I must pass on at once to consider the
main trunk routes from the West Coast leading- into the interior of Airica.
Passino- over those regions on the West Coast where railways would only be
commenced because of the prohable settlement, temporary or permanent, ot white
men--passing over, that is, the whole of the German sphere ot influence--we hrst
come to more dense native populations near the coast towns of Lenguela and
St Paul de Loauda. The latter locality is the more hopeful ot the two, accord-
ing^ to our map, and here we find that the Portuguese have already con-
                                             miles to close to Ambaca. The   intention
structed a railway  leading inland  for 191  Bay was originally announced,
of connecting this  railway with    Delagoa                                  and 1 am

not aware to what extent this vast project has now been cut down, so as to bring
Ait within the region of practical proposals.     further length of 35iniles is, at all

events, being constructed, and 87 more miles have been surveyed. The 1 ortuguese
appear to be very active at present in this district, as there are several other rail-
ways already under consideration ; one from Benguela to Bihe, of which 16 miles
is in operation, another from Mossamedes to the Huilla Plateau, and a third trom
the Congo to the Zambesi. It is difficult to foretell what will be the outcome of

these schemes, but our population map is not very encouraging.  _

Next we come to the Congo, and here there is a grand opportunity of opening
                                     In going up this great stream from the  coast we
(up the interior of the continent.
first traverse about 150 miles of   navigable waterway, and afterwards we    come_ to

some 200 miles of cataracts, through which steamers cannot pass. Round this im-
pediment a railway is now being pushed, 180 kilometres of rails (117 miles) being
already laid. Then we enter Stanley Pool, and from this point we have open
before us--if Belgian estimates are to be accepted--7,000 miles of navigable water-
way If this fact is correct, and if the population is accurately marked on our
map, then tliere is no place in all Africa where 200 miles of railway may be ex-
pected to produce such marked results. The districts traversed are unhealthy,
and the natives are, generally speaking, of a low type ; bat in spite of these draw-
backs, which no doubt will delay progress considerably, we may conndently predict

a orand future for this great natural route into the interior.
  ° To the north of the Congo, the next great navigable waterway met with is the
Nio-er. Again, granting the correctness of the population map, it can be seen at a
gla'nce that there is no area of equal size in all Africa so densely inhabited, and no

district where trade with the existing native population appears to offer greater
inducement to open up a commercial route into the interior. Luckily little has to

be done in this respect, for the Niger is navigable for light-draught steamers in the
full season as far as Rabba, about 550 miles from the sea ; here the navigation

soon becomes obstructed by rocks, and at Wuru, about 70 miles further up the
river, the rapids are so unnavigable that even the light native canoes have to be

·emptied before attempting a passage, and there are frequent upsets. From \N uru

the rapids extend to Wara, after which a stretch of clear and slow-running river
is met with. Above this, again, the Altona Rapids extend for a distance of 15
miles ; then 15 miles of navigable waterwav, and then 20 miles more of rapids are
encountered. Yelo, the capital of Yauri, is situated on these latter cataracts, above

which the IMiddle Niger is navigable for a considerable length. The Bmue is also
navigable in the floods for many miles, the limits being at present unknown ; part

of the year, however, it is quite impassable except for canoes. The trade with

the Western Sudan, which has been made possible by the opening up of this river,

is still only in its infancy, and to get the full benefit of this waterway a line of

railway ought to be carried on from Lokoja to Kano, the great commercial centre
of Hausal and Mr. Robinson's recent journeys over this country, which we hope to

hear about at a later period of our proceedings, have served to confirm the impres-

sion that no great physical difficulties would be encountered. The political con-

dition of the country may, however, make the construction of this railway quits
impossible fur the present ; for here we are on the borderland between Mahom-
848 REPORT-- 1896.

medanism and Paganism, where the slave trade always puts great impediments in
the path of progress, but where the same circumstances make it so eminently desir-
able to introduce a higher condition of civilisation. The only drawback to the
Niger as a line of communication to the Western Sudan is the terribly unhealthy

nature of the coast districts which have to be traversed. Any man, who finds a.

means of combating the deadly diseases here met with, will be the greatest bene-
factor that Africa has ever had ; but of such a discovery there are but few signs

at present.

      It is perhaps too soon to speculate as to the best means of opening a trade

route to Wadai and the more central parts of the Western Sudan ; for we may be-
sure that little will be done in this direction for years to come. Several com-
peting routes are possible. From the British sphere, we may try to extend our

communications eastward from the navigable parts of the Binue. The French,

on the other hand, may push northwards from the Ubangi ; whilst, in a latei-
stage of commercial evolution, the best route of all may be found through
German terrritory, by pushing a railway from the sliore in a direct Hue towards
Bagirmi and Wadai. To compare the relative merits of these trunk lines is
perhaps looking too far into the future, and traversing too much unknown
country, to make the di.scussion at all profitable.

     Proceeding northwards, or rather westwards, along the coast we find ourselves

skirting the belt of dense forest already described as being the great obstacle to

advance in this part of Africa. Tt is to be hoped that this barrier will be pierced

in several places before long. Naturally we turn our attention to the different
spheres of British influence, and here we are glad to learn that there ai'e several

railways being constructed or being considered, with a view to opening up the

interior.

     At Lagos a careful survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba has
been made, and the first section is to be commenced at once. To connect the
Niger with the coast in this way would require 240 miles of railway, but the
immediate objectives are the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan, which are said to-
contain more than a third of a million inhabitants between them. No doubt the
populous coast region makes such a line most desirable ; but whether it would
be wise to push on at all quickly to the Niger, and thus to come into competition

with the steamboat traffic on that river, is a very different question.
     Surveys have also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantain or

Apan on the Gold Coast with Insuaim, a town situated on a branch of the Prab.

It is believed that the local traffic will be sufficiently remunerative to justify the

construction of this line. But, looking to the further prolongation of this rail-

way into the interior, it appears possible that those who selected this route were
too much influenced by the desire to reach Kumasi, which is a political rather

than a commercial centre. According to the views I have been advocating to-day,

the main object of a railway in this quarter shoidd be the crossing of the forest

belt, and if, as there is some reason to believe, that belt is exceptionally wide and

dense in this locality, the choice of Kumasi as a main point on the route will

Ahave been an unfortunate selection.  little further south, nearer the banks of

the Volta, it is probable that more open land would be met with, and moreover

that river itself, which is navigable for steam launches from Ada to Akusi, would

be of use as a preliminary means of transport. It is to be hoped that the merits

of a line from Accra through Odumase will be considered before it is too late.

I am now approaching tlie end of my brief survey of tropical Africa, for the best

method of openin? communication between the Upper Niger and the coast is the

last subject I shall touch on. With this object in view, the French have con-

structed a railway from Kayes, the head of steam navigation during high water,

on the Senegal to Bafulab(5, with the intention of ultimately continuing the line

to Bamaku on the Niger Unexpected difficulties have been met with in the

construction of this railway, and, as the Senegal River between Kayes and St.
Louis is only navigable for about a quarter of the year, it would hardly appear as
if the selection of this route had been based on sound geographical information.

No doubt the French will find some other practicable way of connecting the Upper
                            ;

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  819

Niger with tbe coast, and surveys are already in progress with that object in

view. It may be worth mentioning that the Gambia is navigable as far as

Yarbutenda, and that it affords on tbe whole a better waterway than the Senegal

it is possible, therefore, that a railway from Yarbutenda to Bamaku might form a

better means of connecting the Niger with the coast, than the route the French

have selected.

     At Sierra Leone a railway is now being constructed in a south-easterly
direction with a view of tapping the country at the back of Liberia. But here, as
in the case of the Gambia route, political considerations are of paramount im-
portance ; for no doubt the best commercial route, geographically speaking, would

have been a line run in a north-easterly direction to some convenient point on the
navigable part of the Upper Niger. If such a railway were ever constructed, it
would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with thii
best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it would cross the Anglo-Frencli

boundary is a complete bar to this project at present.
     Proposals for connecting Algeria with the Upper Niger by rail have often been

discussed in the French press, the idea being to unite the somewhat divided parts

of the French sphere of influence by this means. If the views here sketched

forth as to the necessity of selecting more or less populous districts for the first

opening up of Hues of communication into the interior are at all correct, these
projects would be simple madness. For many a year to come Algeria and the
Niger will be connected by sea far more efficiently than by any overland route,
and I feel sure that when the details of these plans are properly worked out we
shall not find the French wasting their money on such purely sentimental schemes.

     I must now conclude, and must give place to the other geographers who have
kindly undertaken to read papers to us on many interesting subjects. All I have

attempted to do is briefly to sketch out some of the main geographical problems
connected with the opening of Central Africa in the immediate future. Such a

review is necessarily imperfect, but its very imperfections illustrate the need of

more accurate geographical information as to many of the districts in question.
Many bhuiders may have been made by me in consequence of our inaccurate know-
ledge, and, from the same cause, many blunders will certainly be made in future by

those who have to lay out these routes into the interior. In fact my desire has

been to prove that, notwithstanding the vast strides that geography has made in
past years in Africa, there is yet an immense amoimt of valuable work ready for
anyone who will undertake it.

     Possibly, in considering this subject, I have been tempted to deviate from the

strictly geographical aspect of the case. Where geography begins and where it
ends is a question which lias been the subject of much dispute. "Whether geography
should be classed as a separate science or not has been much debated. No doubt
it is right to classify scientific work as far as possible ; but it is a fatal mistake to
attach too much importance to any such classification. Geography is now going
through a somewhat critical period in its development, in consequence of the

solution of nearly all the great geographical problems that used to stir the imagina-

tion of nations ; and for this reason such discussions are now specially to the fore.

My own humble advice to geographers would be to spend less time in considering

what geography is and what it is not ; to attack every useful and interesting
problem that presents itself for solution ; to take every help we can get from every
quarter in arriving at our conclusions and to let the name that our work goes by

                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

take care of itself.

about forty additional megalithic ruins of the type called by the Arabs Senam.
The route taken was by the Wadi Terr'qurt, a fine valley running parallel to the

Wadi Doga, by which he entered the hills in 1895. He then proceeded to the

districts of Ghirrah and Mamurah, south of Ferjana, through which runs a great

wadi, the Tergilat. This reaches the sea at Kam, twelve miles south-east of the

ruins of Leptis Magna, and is undoubtedly the Cinyps of Herodotus. On reaching

Kamthe coast a week was spent at the ruins of Leptis and the  district, and the

                   By Hugh Robert Mill, D.Sc, F.R.S.E.

     The scheme submitted is that of providing for each sheet of the 1-inch Ordnance
Survey map a memoir giving a succinct account of the geography of the district
represented. For this purpose it would be necessary to give an index of the names
on the map, certain measurements of natural features, e.g., mean height of land,

length of rivers, &c., a full discussion of the physical geography in the light of
modern geographical methods, and an indication of the influence exerted by
geographical conditions on the utilisation of natural resources, the sites of towns,
and the movements of population. The scheme has been published in full in the
' Geographical Journal ' for April 1896 ; but since, if it is ever to be carried out, it
will require the co-operation of an immense number of workers throughout the

country, it is desirable that no opportunity be lost for making it known and

eliciting criticisms or suggestions.

     William Sheldon, of Weston and Beoley (died 1570), was an enterprising man,

who conceived the idea of introducing the art of tapestry weaving into England.
He sent to Flanders one Eichard Hicks, ofBarchestou, to learn the work and bring
back artisans. Among other results of the looms which were kept in work for at
least half a century after Sheldon's death are five maps of the Midland counties
wliich were bought by Horace Walpole after the mansion at Weston was pulled
down in 1776 for the sum of thirty guineas, and given by him to Earl Harcourt,
who presented two to the Bodleian and kept three at Nuneham, where they

remained until 1827, when Archbishop Havcourt presented them to the Museum at

YorK. Goujrh has described them at this period in his British Topographer,

1780. The fii'st noticed represents Warwickshire, and is now at York. It is

l.j ft. : 17 ft. .; 3 ft. exclusive of the border, and contains a long inscription copied
IVom Camden. Its date is ascertained by the arms of Sheldon impaling Markham,

viz., Edward Sheldon, grandson of William, who married Elizabeth Markham

about 1588, wliich date is on the map.

The second of the Y'ork maps is the most modern, having the arms of Ralph

Sheldon, born 1623, and his wife Henrietta, daughter of Viscount Rocksavage. In

tMs map the north is at the top, but in the former map the north is upon the

east side. This represents the valley of the Thames from Chippenham (spelt

Chipnam) to London Bridge, the dimensions are 13 ft. x 17 ft. 9 inches.

The third map at York is one of Worcestershire, and is so begrimed with soot

as to be almost undecipherable, though enough can be made out to identify it with

Gough's description.

AThe Bodleian maps are much mutilated.  large fragment cut off one made

into a screen was sold at the Strawberry Hill Sale, 1842, and Mr. D. P. (Dudley

Perceval ?) in 'Notes and Queries,' June 20, 1869, says that he had lately been offered

a portion of the AVest of Gloucestershire at an old curiosity shop. Still there are

remnants of great beauty and interest. On the fragments of the border are many

ornamental and allegorical figures, one favourite subject being the exploits of

Hercules. There is a small map of Africa also which has unfortunately suilered

terribly, though the Capo de Bona Speranza and the island of Madagascar are

quite distinct. Another feature is that poetical inscriptions in decorative panels

form part of the bordei-.

    The Tudor arms also date the map as having been executed before the accession
of James I., and Richard Hyckes has placed his name upon it. 'Wigom: comit:
Compiletata, Rich. Hyckes.' The remaining map is one of the valley of the
Thames similar to the one at Y'ork already described. It was from this that
Walpole cut the piece for the screen. Fortunately, the piece containing London is

intact 18 X 36 inches, and gives a most graphic and curious portraiture of the
suburbs. The manor houses and deer parks, the churches, villages, bridges, and

windmills, are all represented in a bird's-eye view, and the colours have stood the

test of time remarkably well. Every village is named, and the spelling even to
-some obvious mistakes seems to follow that of Saxton's maps, but these maps are
so much larger a scale, 3 inches to tl;e mile, that it is evident some personal

observation or survey was undertaken, I am inclined to believe, by Francis Hicks,
of Barcheston, who was a student at St. Marv Hall, Oxford, and a good scholar.
He died in 1630.

      2. The Altels Avalanche. By Tempest Anderson, M.D., B.Sc.

    On September 11, 1895, an enormous avalanche fell from the Altels mountain
and overwhelmed a large pasture ; it destroyed 6 men and 150 cattle.

    About two hours to the south of Kandersteg the Gemmi path traverses an

upland valley with the Altels rising steeply from the stream on the east side and
with gentle slopes on the west, rising to the foot of the Oeschinen Grat, a precipi-
tous wall of rocks which separates it from the Oeschinen Thai. The basin_of
852 REPORT-- 1896.

Spittalmatte thus formed is about 1^ mile long from north to south and J mile
wide. Its southern portion is diversified by low wooded hills, the Arvenwald,

obviously formed by avalanches in past ages, and the northern portion was an open
pasture or Alp now overwhelmed.

The Altels is a roughly pyramidal mountain. The west face from which the

avalanche descended slopes at a high angle, and the limestone strata of which it is
composed dip at about the same angle. The upper part is, or rather was, covered

with snow and glacier ice. At a certain distance from the top the glacier ceases

to spread, and becomes confined within rocky walls on either side, where the

strata, formerly continuous, have been removed in past ages by avalanches.

The whole width of the glacier at the place where it has slid appears from the
Sigfried map to be about a kilometre, and the middle half of this descended,

leaving a portion of about ^ kilometre standing at each side. The portion on the
south side which has not descended is separated from the rest by a wall of rock,

and this separation probably accounts for it not having come down at the same time
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

it extends lower down the mountain than the fallen part appears to have done.

    The avalanche descended to the bottom of the valley, a vertical distance of
about 4,000 feet, and the acquired momentum carried the greater part of it up the

slope on the other side to a height of about 400 feet above the lowest point.

Here it spread out in a fan shape, and formed a return current on each side, the

northern one of which descended again quite to the bottom of the valley. There

were also local return slips. The stream was covered up by the avalanche ice, but
speedily worked a way underneath it, and the glacier bridge thus formed had not

quite melted on a second visit a year after the event. The area covered was about

1 mile by ^ mile. The average thickness, as estimated in the sections exposed by
the return slips, was about 6 feet, but there were places 20 feet thick, and some

doubtless more, near the bed of the stream. The materials of which the avalanche

was composed were an intimate mixture of snow and glacier ice with stones and

mud, the two former, perhaps, on the whole, predominating ; but in one good
exposure, though the ice and snow predominated in the upper part the stones and

mud did so near the base. Many of the stones showed marks of rubbing and scratch-

ing, especially those at the parts of the avalanche further from the Altels ; nearly

all of these, however, retained some angle unworn, and thus differed from ordinary

river gravel.

The effects of the wind which always accompanies avalanches was strikingly

shown by the over-turning of about 1,000 trees and the destruction of some

chalets, the materials of which were carried above 100 yards. The tops of the
trees all pointed radially away from the direction of the couloir, down which tlie

avalanche had fallen. This destruction by the wind was in an area outside that

actually overwhelmed bj' the avalanche, and here also large boulders could be seen

which had been rocked by the force of the wind, Six men were killed in the

chalets, and about 160 cattle on the pasture.

The ice cliff left standing by the fall of the avalanche was semi-elliptical in

shape, about ^ a kilometre in extent, and from 50 feet to 70 feet high. Nearly all
of it presented the appearance of a perfectly fresh fracture. There were blue

veins of more compact ice in many parts, and also a few dirt bands of stones in

the substance of the ice. One was specially conspicuous towards the south end of

the cliff, and about one-third of its height from the bottom. Its presence here

was very remarkable, as there are no rocks overhanging the glacier from which the

Astones could have fallen.  few rocks just peep through the snow at the edge of

the arete, and if the stones did not come from this source, which seems unlikely,

they must have been picked up by the glacier from its floor. There were slight

indications of another crack in the glacier parallel with, and perhaps 100 yards

further up than, the cliff, but the author is inclined to think that it was only the

usual bergschrund.

     The rocky floor of the glacier left exposed by the fall was singularly smooth,
and its inclination coincided with the dip of the limestone strata of which it was
composed. Dr. Heim believes that the glacier is usually frozen in its bed, and

that the catastrophe is due to the unusual period of hot weather which preceded it.

A sim'Jar avalanche whicb took place at the same place in 1782 also followed a

period of unusual heat.

The author visited and photographed the scene of the avalanche in the first

instance on September 23, 1895, and followinf? days, and again visited it Sep-

Atemher 9, 1896.  good deal of ice still remains unmelted. The stones, having

been -washed hy rain, show their scratchings much more conspicuously than last

year. Vegetation is beginning to show itself in many places, spreading chiefly

from sods and pieces of earth dislodged hy, and mi.\ed up with, the avalanche

material.

     The ice cliff has altered very little in appearance, though it is somewhat
rounded by melting. The dirt bands are still conspicuous.

The total loss in land and cattle has been estimated at 130,000 francs, or above

5,000/.

                   3. On Uganda and the Ujjper Nile.
         By Lieutenant C. F. S. Vandeleur, Scots Guards.

Lieutenant Yandeleur started from Mombasa on September 7, 1894, with Mr.

Jackson and Captain Ashburnham, and a large caravan of about 400 men, carrying

arms and ammunition, and after a most successful march reached Uganda at the

end of November, at the time Colonel, now Sir H. E. Col vile, was Commissioner.

He started again with Major Cunningham on December 19 for Unyoro and Lake

Albert. The road used at that time led by Slngo and across the river Kafu at

Barauwa, and was a very bad one, crossing many large and deep swamps. The

first Wanyoro were met witli at Kaduma, and there is a marked difference

hetween them and the Waganda, the former having much sharper features, and

being of a slighter build than the Waganda. Having arrived at Fort Hoima,

the headquarters, on January 1, 1895, after a halt of five days they continued

their journey to the Albert Xyanza. On nearing the lake the country became

more open and rocky in places, until the edge of the escarpment was reached,

where the lake lies 1,200 feet below it, bordered by a strip of yellow sand, the

Sudanese fort and the native village called Kibero looking mere specks close to the

water's edge. Lieutenant Vandeleur then described the journey down the Nile

Ain a steel boat with a crew of sixteen men.  friendly Wanyoro chief called

Keyser, who spoke the Lure language, and had lived at Wadelai, went as guide.

They sailed all the first day with a good breeze, and camped on the western shore

at Mahagi after dark, where they had difficulty in findinsr a landing place, owing

to the reeds and swampy nature of the shore. They eventually reached

Wadelai, and camped one mile further on at Emin Pasha's old fort, which was

then completely overgrown. The natives appeared very hostile, and had evidently

throvra in their lot with Kabba Rega, king of Unyoro. After Wadelai the

stream was very strong, and they glided rapidly past narrow channels through

the floating vegetation and papyrus, stopping sometimes near the villages on the

banks to ask for news, at all of which they were informed that the dervishes were

advancing from Dufile by both banks. The first Madi village was met with at
Towara, and the natives became more friendly as they made their way down the

river. The natives are continually fighting among themselves, and lead a pre-

carious existence ; several of the latter came to have their wounds dressed.

    An enormous amount of floating vegetation passes down the Nile ; it is gradu-

ally broken off from the sides of the river by the force of the current, and floats

down until it attaches itself to the sides again, or reaches the cataracts below

Dufile, where it gets broken up into little pieces. After Bora, an old Egyptian
Hfort on the right bank, the river is very broad, about
                                                         miles, though the

actual channel through the mud is only about 500 yards in breadth. The banks

between Unigwe and Dufile seemed well populated ; several of the tillages were

hidden away among the high rocks and boulders on small hills close to the river,

and there was a certain amount of dhurra and mtama cultivation, but very few-

sheep and goats. Late in the afternoon of January 14 they arrived at the old

fort at Dufile, situated close to the water's edge at a bend of the river on the
--854 REPORT 1896,

left bank. The parapet and ditch were still very distinct ; some mud-hrick houses,

some lemon and cotton trees, were the only signs remaining of the Egyptian

occupation. It is believed they were the first white men to have reached Dufile

since the abandonment of the place in 1888. The native reports proved quite

untrue, and the dervishes were now at RegafF, below the cataracts, wliich they

went to inspect the next day.  The Madi natives are a fine, strong-looking race
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

they wear little or no clothes, and have no wants excepting beads and iron wire.

Atl'miaa's village, at the bend of the Nile, a representative of Abu Sulla was

met with, an important chief living one day's march below Dufile, on the right

bank. He was dressed in white cloth, which was probably obtained from tlie

Arabs or Mahdists to the north. Most of the villages are reached by narrow

channels, cut through the floating vegetation, and are almost impossible to find.

The return journey to the Albert Nyanza was long and tedious, owing to the

strong stream. On reaching the Albert Nyanza camp was pitched at Boki ; it

was a very dark night, and a large herd of elephants came down on both sides of

the camp to drink, some of them coming unpleasantly close.

The people on tlie west of the Albert Nyanza used to pay tribute to Kabba

Eega, but that is at an end now. The Shulis, in the angle contained by the two

Niles, are inclined to be friendly. With steamers on the lake and railway com-

munication, a large extent of country would be opened for trade, and there is no

limit at present to the ivory to be obtained from the countries bordering the

Albert. There is no hindrance to navigation down to Dufile. The road now

used between T'nyoro and Uganda passes by Mrulfi ,at the junction of the Kafu

river, where there is a fort garrisoned by Sudanese, and on along the Victoria Nile

to Lake Kioja, from where it runs in a direct line to Mengo, the capital of

"Uganda. The road is a very good one, and has been carried across the swamps or

causeways.

In Kampala there are broad roads which enclose houses and shambas. The

railway will make a great difterence to this country. There is a large demand

for European clothes, boots, and shoes ; the people are very imitative, and already

the king and chiefs have given orders to traders for various articles which they

Asee the Europeans possess.    great deal of rice and a certain amount of English

potatoes and native coffee are grown in Uganda. Cotton has been found to grow

well. One result of the railway will be that horses and donkeys will be trans-

ported rapidly through the belt of country infested by the tsetse fly, and ought

to reach Uganda in good condition. Animals do well there, if well looked after,

though dangers exist in .snakes and bad grass met with in places.

4. Coast-forms of Romney Marsh, By Dr. F. G. Gulliver.

     Dunoeness Point in south-eastern England projects from the dissected 'W'eald
doine into the English Channel. It consists of two classes of recent deposits,
shingle and marsh. It is proposed here to discuss these deposits, formed during
the present cycle of shore development, as representing a coastal form characteristic

of a certain stage of a cycle.

    The whole deposit may be called a cuspate foreland.' Foreland is here used

as a technical term, meaning those deposits which are built in front of the oldland,
including all those forms that project into the sea beyond the initial coastline,

which was formed where the sea surface intersected the land at the beginning of

the cycle.

This initial coast was attacked by the sea, and early in the development of the

coast and shore form a low cliff or ' nip ' was made in the coast all along the shore.

At a later stage in the development the supply of load was just enough to
Aequal the ability of the sea to transport, and a graded condition resulted.
                                                                              beach

now was seen "at the foot of the clift'. This equilibrium would not last at all

            ' Bull. G.S.A., vol. vii. 1805, p. 399.

points, and aggradation would necessarily occur when more waste was supplied

tUan the sea could carry. This aggradation would take place where the action of
the sea wasting was least. The writer has suggested eddies in the tidal in and

outflow as the determining agent in the location of some of the cuspate forelands.'

     Topley recognised the action of the sea upon the oldland previous to the build-

ing out of this foreland. He said : ' Along the northern boundary pf Romney
Marsh the termination of the Weald Clay is certainly an old sea-cliff, now worn
down into undulating ground.' * The much fresher cliff north from Rye_ along the

military road indicates a more recent action of the sea upon this portion of the

initial shoreline.

     The geographic interpretation from form is corroborated by the history and

tradition of Romney Marsh.

    The historical students of Romney Marsh do not sufficiently regard the line of
former shorelines indicated by the ridges of shmgle, but place rather too much
reliance upon outlines given on early maps, many of which show poor sketching
and little knowledge of geographic form. It has been very common to attribute

the formation of this great deposit to the tides, but the details of the process have
not been e.-siplained except in a most general manner by such expression as the

' meeting of the tides.'

Diagrams were shown illustrating the formation of tidal cuspate forelands,

and it was pointed out that Dungeness with its included marshes corresponds to

the filled stage plus cutting back and rebuilding of the Point.
     The most recent curves of aggradation are very prettily shown at the Point

when looking toward the centre of the cuspate foreland from the lighthouse.

Recent observations at the Point indicate that this shoreline is here advancing at
Athe rate of 9 feet a year.
                             mile to the west tlie sea is at present cutting into

the shingle. Upon the eastern side of this foreland thei-e are some twenty-three

successive shorelines shown between Lydd and the present shoreline. These all

curve sympathetically, indicating steps in the eastward growth of the foreland.
These ridges are not absolutely parallel or continuous, for some twenty lines of

aggradation at the Point were traced by the writer into fourteen at a point a mile

]iorth, and these fourteen were in turn traced into seventeen ridges at a point a

couple of miles further north.' At one time there seems to be gi-eater advance in

one place, and when the complex conditions which govern depositions are changed

another point receives the most waste.

    The hypothetical initial shoreline was indicated by a diagram. Where the

cliffs are high the initial land has presumably been most cut back. Behind the

foreland the land probably did not extend a great deal farther than the present

low cliff or ' nip ' which was made in the youth of the present cycle.
    On account of the graded form the present coast may appropriately be said to

be in adolescence, foUowmg Professor Davis' use of this term for land surfaces.'

     English sailors have recognised forms similar to Dungeness, and have applied

the same name to forelands of like geological structure in Puget Sound, and south

of Patagonia in the Straits of Tierra del Fuego.

6 The Influence of Climate and Vegetation on African Civilisations.

                 By G. F. Scott-Elliot, F.L.S., F.R.G.S.

    An attempt is made in this paper to connect the various African states of

civilisation with the climate and vegetation of the particular districts in which
they took origin. For this purpose the continent is divided into four main groups
or divisions, which are characterised by the following points:

     I. 'The ivet junr/lc, which is marked roughly by the presence of the oil or

-- --·cocoanut palm, numerous creepers especially the Landolphia (rubber vines) and

such forms as Sesamum, Cajanus indicus, and Manihot as cultivated plants. This
reo-ion is characterised by great heat and continuous humidity, without a season
.sufficiently dry to leave a mark on the vegetation.

     II. The (^esw^s.--Characterised by xerophytic adaptations, by Zilla, Mesem-
brvanthemum, Capparis sodada, &c. The climate is distinguished by possessing

--no" proper rainy season whatever.
    III. The acacia and dry grass region. Characterised by acacias, tree euphor-
bias, o-iant grasses, or frequently grassy plains in which each tuft of grass is
isolated. The climate is marked from all the remaining regions by distinct dry
and wet seasons ; the dry season occupies from five to nine months, and leaves a
distinct mark on the vegetation. This region occupies practically all Africa
between 3,000 feet and 5,000 feet, and also extends below 3,000 feet wherever the

--above climatic conditions prevail.
     IV. The temperate grass and forest area. This region is distinguished by
havino- at no season of the year such drought as leaves a permanent mark on the
vegetation, by a moderate rainfall, by moderate heat, &c. The grass resembles
the turf of temperate countries, and the forest shows the same sorts of adap-
tation as occur in temperate countries. This region is found between 4,600 feet

and 7,000 feet.

     The paper is an attempt to trace the native races inhabiting these divisions,

comparing their civilisations, so far as this is possible.

     I. The wet jungle is shown to be limited by the direction of the prevalent

winds ('Challenger' Reports), by various meteorological considerations, and by
the elevation. It extends to 3,000 feet, but often ceases below this level.
Reference is given to the works of many travellers, to the Report of the British
Association dealing with African meteorology, and by the assistance of these data
an attempt is made to trace its boundaries exactly. Then it is shown that it is
everywhere inhabited by small tribes of a weak, enfeebled character and on the
lowest stage of civilisation. All these tribes have been subdued by Arabs and

Europeans Avithout difficulty.

II. The desert is very shortly disposed of. The account is directed chiefly to

the extreme severity of the climate and the exceedingly healthy and vigorous
Anature of the tribes inhabiting it.
                                      short account of the causes leading to its

present condition is also given.

III. The acacia region is more clearly and carefully defined, and hints are given

as to the easiest means of recognising the climate from the vegetation. It is shown

to vary much in character, and a brief sketcli is given of the Upper Scarcies and

Nio-er region about Falaba, of the Mombasa to Kibwezi tract, of the Shir6 High-

lands, and the Victoria Nyanza basin. The region is shown to be everywhere

Tather densely inhabited, but there has not been a swarming centre, and no

emigration in large numbers has taken place from this acacia region. The nations

inhabiting it have also fallen under the Arab and European with scarcely a

Anstruggle.  explanation is given of the reason of this.

IV. The temperate grass and forest regions above 5,000 feet are then shown to

be the only places in Africa that have acted as swarming centres of population.

The character of the native races inhabiting them is shown to be vigorous and

turbulent, and often raiding is carried on. The differences in climate, vegetation,

and abundance of wild and domestic animals are shown to explain why it is that
                                                                                   ·

these races only have, except in one instance, resisted both Arab and European.
In a note an attempt is made to reconcile the classification given by Herr Engler

with that adopted in this paper.

                  7. Sand Dunes. By Vaughan Coknish, M.Sc.

     In the sorting of materials by wind the coarser gravel is left on stony deserts

or sea-beaches, the sand is heaped up in duae tracts, and the dust (consisting

largely of friable materials which have been reduced to powder in the dune dis-

trict itself) forms widely scattered deposits beyond the limits of the dune district.

Three principal factors operate                             in  dune      tracts,  viz.  (1)  the wind                                        (2) the eddy in
                                                                                                                                           ;

the  lee of each  obstacle                                  (3) gravity.  The wind drifts the tine and the coarse sand.
                                                         ;

The upward motion of the eddy lifts the tine sand and, co-operating with tlie wind,

sends it flying from the crest of the dune. The backward motion of the eddy

arrests the forward drift of the coarser sand, and thus co-operates with the wind

to build the permanent structure of the dune. Gravity reduces to the angle of

rest any slopes which have been forced to a steeper pitch either by wind or eddy ;

hence in a group of dunes the amplitude cannot be greater than (about) one-tbird

of the wave-length. This limit is most nearly approached when the wind blows

alternately from opposite quarters, but does not hold in one quarter sufficiently

long to completely reverse the work of preceding winds. Gravity also acts upon

the sand which flies from the crests, causing it to fall across the stream lines of

the air, the larger or heavier particles falling more steeply. To the varying density

of the sand-shower is due the varying angle of the windward slope of dunes.

When there is no sand-shower the windward becomes as steep as the leeward slope.

When the dune tract is all deep sand the lower part of the eddy gouges out the

trough, and, when the sand-shower fails, the wind by drifting and the eddy by

gouging form isolated hills upon a hard bed. On the other hand, the sand-shower

sometimes smooths over a dune tract, leaving lines of hollows (' Fuljes'), where

the troughs were deepest and the wind strongest. The encroachment of a dune

tract being due not only to the march of the dunes (by drifting) but also to the

formation of new dunes to leeward from material supplied by the sand-shower,

it follows that there is both a ' group velocity ' and a ' wave velocity ' of dunes.

Since the wave velocity decreases as the amplitude increases, a sufficiently large

dune is a stationary hill, even though composed of loose sand throughout. Bind-

ing the surface will stop the wave-motion, but not the group motion. Both may

be arrested by promoting the growth of the dime.

     The fundamental forms of sand-dunes include the Imigitudinal, formed where

the strength of the wind is too great to permit free lateral growth. Where the

wind begins to decrease a form is met with intermediate between the longitudinal

and the transverse. Conical dunes may be produced by the action of varying

winds upon the rudimentary longitudinal dunes, called Barchanes.

     Where material is accumulated by the action of tidal currents, forms homolo-

gous with the ground plan of dunes are produced.

           1 . World Maps of Mean Monthly Rainfall.
       By Andrew J. Herbertson, F.R.S.E., F.R.G.S.

     For practical purposes it is almost as important to know how rainfall is

distributed throughout the year, as to know the total annual precipitation. The

best way to show this is to make maps of mean monthly rainfall that will be

comparable. Each month must be considered one-twelfth of a year and the

average monthly rainfall reduced accordingly. This is being done at present by
Dr. Buchan, Secretary of the Scottish Meteorological Society, and the author, and,
as far as they are aware, it is the first attempt to do so for the whole world. The
scanty records of some regions make the positions of the lines of equal rainfall
{isohyets) somewhat uncertain. These are dotted on the maps. The other isohyets
are shown by firm lines, and the diiferent intensities of colour indicate different
quantities of water precipitated. From such maps the relationship of the distri-
bution of rainfall to latitude and altitude, to remoteness from the coast and the

nature of the land around, to the changing seasons or prevalent winds, is

clearly seen. Some typical examples were given, especially those of economic

importance.

4. Practical Geography in Manchester. By J. Howard Reed.

The author believes the Manchester Geographical Society has demonstrated that

geography is popular among the people. Mr. Eli Sowerbutts, secretary of the

Manchester Society, commenced giving popular geographical lectures some years

ago. The demands for work of this kind grew to such proportions that a body of

prominent members of the Society, including the chairman, took up the lecturing

work, which has increased year by year ever since. The lecturers now form an
organised body of expert geographers and practised speakers, who freely volunteer
their services for the purpose of spreading reliable geographical information. The

lectures are all given in a popular manner, and are mostly illustrated by lantern

views. During the past five years over three hundred lectures have been delivered

in Manchester and the surrounding districts, and over ninety thousand hearers have

been reached. The audiences are principally of the working class, but also include

the members of many well-known literary and scientific clubs, and students of

continuation schools. The lectures given include such titles as : ' Shaping of the

Earth's Surface by Water-action,' ' Map Projection,' ' India,' ' China, Corea, and

Japan,' ' Polar Exploration,' ' Across the Rocky Mountains,' ' Canada,' ' Across

Africa with Stanley,' ' Uganda,' &c. Applications for lectures are made to an hon.

secretary, who conducts all correspondence and makes arrangements with the local
societies and clubs and the lecturers. The engagement of halls, printing, and

similar matters are carried out on the spot by the local people. This system has

proved so satisfactory, and the enthusiasm of the voluntary workers has been so

well maintained, that no hitch has ever occurred. The terms on which the lectures

are given are very simple. Any member of the Manchester Geographical Society

or any affiliated society is entitled to apply for lectures. Lantern apparatus and
Avolunteer operator are supplied when required.
                                                 nominal fee is charged for each

lecture, travelling and lantern expenses being added when incurred. Any balance

in hand at the end of each season is applied to the upkeep of lantern plant and the
making and purchase of new slides. Another important branch of voluntary work

consists in the analysis of some two hundred British and foreign scientific journals.

This is most useful for scholars and students. It enables them to follow up, with

ease, the literature on any special subject. It has received the commendation of

several high authorities. The Manchester geographers intend to follow up the

work they are doing, and hope to more fully occupy the field. They are conscious

that there is ample room for development. The author feels sure they would be

glad to hear of similar organised efl'ort in other parts of the coimtry.

     In the winter of 1889-90 a volcanic eruption took place under the ice of these

two glaciers, causing an enormous Jcikulhlaup, or glacier leap. The whole face of the
;30 mile wide Bniar Jokull was carried forward, in some places for nearly 6 English
miles; and the face of the 15 mile wide Eyjabakka Jokull for 2 to .3 miles. The

former has since retired 16 yards, and the latter about one-eighth of a mile.

    New cones on the Eyjabakka Jokull, reaching a height of 4 feet. 6in., afford an

inde.x; to the rate of surface diminution which is not less than 8 inches per annum.
The face of this glacier is extremely fine, the ice cliff being 100 feet high; and,
being undermined by the river, it frequently gives wa}', exposing fresh sections.

     The flowers in the valley of the Jokulsa-i-Fljotsdal call for special notice.
Columnar basalt occurs throughout the district. Snrefell is not a single mountain,
but a handsome group often to twelve peaks, mostly composed of tufa and cinder.
The glaciers upon it are small, and lie at a high level. The junction of Jokulkvisl
with Jokulsa-a-Brii is wrongly marked. Reindeer abound in the district.

3. Notes on the less-known Interior of Iceland. By Karl Grossmann,

                                     M.D., F.R.C.S.E., F.G.S.

The author's last journey to Iceland, which was undertaken in the summer

1895, for the purpose of investigating leprosy amongst the inhabitants, admitted of
an exploring excursion into the lonely district to the east of Hekla, while the

crossing of the island from north to south gave occasion for examining parts

t'qually interesting and equally unvisited.

'J'lie eruptions of the various vents comprised under the name of the Hekla
Agroup are particularly rich in obsidian lavas.
                                                 very finely vesicular obsidian

goes as far south as Storolfshvoll. Of very rugged character is the landscape of
the llrafntinnuhraun, most desolate, void of vegetation, full of volcanic jishes and

sand and large torrents of a peculiar obsidian lava, on which in many places the
three stages of pnmice, obsidian, and banded rhyolite are seen in the same blocks,

the three parts following in the order given from above downwards.

    Tlie landscape in the neighbourhood of the large lake of Sudur Namur resembles

a lunar landscape in appearance. Various exquisite craters are found here,

-iraonp'st others one that is probably the finest ring crater in Iceland. On climhino-
up the wall of the ring a central cone is seen of perfect shape, built up of slags

which form a sharp-edged hemispherical cup of beautiful regularity,

    Tbe journey across the island was made from Akureyi by way of the
Eyjafjardara valley. The dense fogs made this part of the journey both difficult
and obscured the views. When the plateau was reached, the clouds lifted, and

the HofsjokuU was seen in all its enormous extent.

860 REPORT-- 1896.

     The country nort'a of tje Hofsjokull is absolutely barren, and consists of gently
undulating territory of loose debris, many water-worn pieces of obsidian and
obsidian bombs being found scattered everywhere. The hot sunshine made it
impossible to cross the swollen Jokulsa vestri, which was followed up to its source

on the Hofsjokull ; but the mud and slush prevented a crossing. Nor could the

horses be brought over the glacier itself. For more than twenty-four hours they
had not had a blade of grass to eat, and it seemed impossible to proceed further
southwards ; but, after a severe night's frost, a fording was ultimately effected in
the small hours of the following morning some miles below the source of the

river.

     The Hveravellir were examined and a large series of photographs taken. The
sinter crater and terraces of these hot springs are the most beautiful in the island,
and the territory round them forms one of the richest oases.

     To the east of the Hveravellir a wide crater resembling Hverfjall, but not
complete to the S.W., was seen, which is neither the Strytur nor Dufufell of
Thoroddsen's map. On the E. it is flanked by a large lake, which was named
Karlsvatn. The lava flow between Hveravellir and the crater mentioned has on
its surface a fine layer of black tachylite, ^ inch thick (specimens were shown).

     The further progress S was of equal interest. The "high peak" called Blagnypa
could not be seen at all, although the weather was perfect during that part of the
journey. On the other hand, very clear photographs were taken of a big mountain
chain of quite alpine character, contrasting most strikingly with the flat and tame
polagonite plateau on which the enormous ice-sheet of the Hofsjokull rests.

     This mountain chain, going from N. to S., has large glaciers quite of alpine
appearance ; that they must be permanent is clear from the fact that the snow had
melted more than usually during that year, so that the snowcap of Skjaldbreid
had disappeared altogether some four weeks previously. Thoroddsen does not

mention these mountains and glaciers, nor does he show them in his map ; he
cannot have seen them, as they are not what he figures as the Kerlingafjoll,

although they take the place immediately north of where he puts the latter.
     The district of the Hvitarvatn was also visited. All tliis district is highly

interesting and full of surprises. It will well repay a careful exploration, as
hitherto only a very sketchy and fragmentary outline of it is known.

                      4. The Relativity of Geographical Advantages.

                      By George G. Chisholm, M.A., B.Sc.

     The considerations to which attention is drawn in this paper are for the most
part obvious and familiar, and the only excuse for laying them before the British

Association is that they are nevertheless apt to be overlooked, especially in esti-
mates of past conditions, and still more in forecasts based on geography as to the
condition of the future.

   --Geographical advantages may be considered (1) as relative to the physical

condition of the surface of a country, e.g. the extent of forests, marshes, &c. The
former and present relative importance of Liverpool and Bristol may be explained

in part at least by changes that have taken place under this head. Also the dif-

ference in direction of some of the great Roman roads and those of the present day,
 and the consequent fact that some important Roman stations in Britain are now
 represented not even by a hamlet. (2) As relative to the political condition of a
 country and of other countries. (3) As relative to the state of military science.
 Under these two heads the difference in the situation of the Roman wall between
 Tyne and Solway and the Anglo-Scottish boundary suggests some considerations.
 Also the difference in the situation of some important Roman towns or stations

 and their modern representatives (Uriconium, Shrewsbury; Sorbiodunum, Salis-

--bury). (4) As relative to the state of applied science well illustrated in this

--country, as in the history of the iron and textile industries. (5) As relative to

 the density of population another important consideration in the industrial history

 of our own country. (6) As relative to the mental attitude of the people where
--:

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  861

the geo<»raphical advantages exist. Many Chinese travellers and students of China

have recognised the excessive reverence for ancestors in that country as one great

hindrance in the way of turning the advantages of the country to account.

5. The various Boundary Lines between British Guiana and Venezuela
    attributed to Sir Robert II. Schomhurgk. By Ralph Richardsox,
     F.R.S.E., Hon. Sec, R.S.G.S., F.S.A. Scot.

    As a Geographical curiosity, if nothing else, the Protean forms assumed by the
celebrated ' Schomhurgk Line ' are worth noticing. Let us tabulate them as laid
down by various eminent authorities in the course of their discussion of the ques-

tion of the Western boundary of British Guiana

   --1. T/ie Schomburgk Line 1841-42 of the Map in the British Government's

Blue Book, March, 1896. Commencing at the mouth of the River Amacura, this
line runs along that river's eastern bank, including as British territory the whole
baein of the River Barima, and then proceeds S.E. to the River Acarabisi, after
which it follows the course of the River Cuyuni, and passes S.E. to the summit of
Mount Roraima, where it stops. It may be noticed that, whilst this Line was
drawn in 1841-42, Schomburgk s surveys were not completed till 1844.

   --2. The ^ Historic^ Schomhurgk Line of Dr. Emil Beich. ' Tiines,' March li,

189G Dr. Reich considers that the ' Schomburgk Line, if drawn from the mouth

of the River Wainy, is borne out by irrefragable historic arguments.' No map,

however, shows a Schomburgk Line drawn from the mouth of the river Waini.

   --o. The 'Legal' Schomburgk Line of Dr. Emil Reich. 'Times,' March 14,

189(3. Dr. Reich holds that the Schomburgk Line, ' if drawn from the mouth of

the Barima, may be defended successfully by legal arguments.' He states that

the line so appears ' in all current maps ; but current maps belonging to the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              '

R.S.G.S. represent the Schomburgk line as drawn not from the mouth of the
Barima, but of the Amacura.

   --4. The ' Reliable ' Schomburgk Line of Mr. John Bolton, F.R. G.S. ' Ninetee7ith

 Century,' February, 1896. Mr. Bolton says the Schomburgk Line first appeared
 on a crude sketch map, lithographed by Arrowsmith in 1840, and presented to
Parliament, and that it was not till 184i that Schomburgk surveyed the country
 north of the River Cuyuni, the original drawing of this survey being sent to the

Colonial Secretary in 1841. It has never been reproduced, but this, the only

 reliable Schomburgk Line, begins at the Amacura mouth, includes as British
 territory the whole basin of the Barima, and stops at the junction of the Acarabisi
and Cuyuni rivers. The * Blue Book,' published by the British Government in
August, 1896, contains a facsimile of Schomburgk's Map of 1841, showing that his
 1841 Line did not stop at the Acarabisi, but was continued along the upper course

of the Cuyuni.

   --5. 'The ' Provisional ' Schomburgk Line of Mr. George G. Dixon. ' The Geo-

graphical Journal,' Ajiril 1895. 'J'bis line corresponds to No. 1, but is derived

from a map published in 1875 attributed to Sir Robert H. Schomburgk, who died
in 1865. The 1875 map in Proceedings R.G.S. 1880 contradicts this one.

      6. The ' Modified ' Schomburgk Line of ' The Statesman's Year-Book,' 1896,
corresponds to Nos. 1 and 5. The ' original ' Schomburgk Line is, however, also
given, and is stated to have been drawn in 1840.

     7. The ' Venezuelan Government's' Schomburgk Line. Mapa de la Parte

 Oriental de Venezuela, published with Government authority at Caracas, 1887.
 Generally speaking, this Line is similar to the ' original ' Schomburgk Line,
 although the former gives Venezuela both banks of the Amacura and Otomonga
 rivers, whereas the ' original ' line gives Venezuela only their western banks.

      S. The ' Original' Schomburgk Line. Reisen in Britisch-Guiana von Richard
 Schomburgk. Mit Abbildungen undeiner Karte von Britisch-Guiana aifgenommen

--von Sir Robert Schomburgk. 2 vols. Leipzig: J.J. Weber. 1847. Three years

 after Sir Robt. H. Schomburgk had completed his surveys, his brother and fellow-

 traveller, Richard, published this important work, to which, with the authority of
                                                                --A'

Sir Robert, he appended the latter's map of British Guiana as prepared by Sii

Robert for the British Government, and showing on it the -well-known ' original

Schomburgk Line. The map is dated 1846 and represents the results of Sir

Kobert's surveys during 1835-44 as lodged in the Colonial Office, London.
Cartographers of all nations have ever since {i.e., for 50 years) represented this
' original ' Schomburgk Line as the western boundary of British Guiana. It was

also recognised as the boundary by the Crown Surveyor of Briiish Guiana in 1875
(Map in Proceedinffs R.G.S. 1880) ; by M. Smidt, Governor of Dutch Guiana, in
the * Kaart van Guiana' (1889); by Professor Sievers, of Giessen, in the

' Globus ' (January, 1896) ; and by Mr. Gignilliat, of the U.S. War Department,

in the 'National Geographic Magazine' (Washington, February 1896). "With
only two exceptions, all the atlases belonging to the R.S.G.S. give the 'original'
Schomburgk Line as the British boundary, thus leaving the British title to terri-
tory w-est of that Line to be proved by treaty rights and by occupation during
a prescriptive period.

1. The Southern Alps ofNeiv Zealand ; and a jn-o2)osed Ascent of Aconcagua,

                                By A. E. Fitzgerald.
    The Now Zealand Alps have in past years been much neglected by travellers.
Few people realise that there exists in our antipodean colony a chain of Alps un-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                       863

surpassed by anything in Switzerland, while the glaciers that roll down from these
great mountains exceed in length and area any of those we know in Europe.

     The Southern Alps, which were explored by the author and Mr. C. G. Barrow
in 1894-95, lie close to the west coast of the South Island. Mount Cook, the
monarch of the range, rises to a height of 12,349 feet, and is situated at not more
than fifteen miles from the sea-coast. The author's work was confined to the

Mount Cook district, between Mount McKerrow and the Whymper Glacier. His
object was to find a pass feasible for tourist traffic during the summer months

between The Hermitage, a small inn in the Tasman Valley, at the foot of the

Hooker and Miiller Glaciers, and the country of Westland, so beautiful in its

luxuriant subtropical vegetation and its great glaciers that roll down amidst lianas

and tree ferns to within 600 feet of the sea level. The part of Canterbury situated
Anear these rano-es is extremely bare and rugged.
                                                   great plateau or table land,

called the McKeuzie country, reaches up towards the Tasman Valley, and in this

are two great glacier-fed lakes, Pukaki and Tekapo. All up and along this great

plain, some 2,000 feet above sea level, can be seen traces of ancient glacier action.

Huge mounds of moraine matter are strewed about, while a low species of snow

grass covers the whole, rendering it all a dreary brown colour.

Mount Sealy, 8,631 feet ; Mount Tasman, second highest in the Colony, 11,475

feet ; Mount Haidinger, 10,107 feet ; the Silberhorn, 10,250 feet ; and Mount

Sefton, 10,359 feet, were ascended. In these ascents much trouble was given by

the rotten condition of the rocks, and by the huge overhanging glaciers, caused no

doubt by the enormous rainfall, and therefore snowfall, in high altitudes. The

snow line is very low, not more than 6,000 feet. This, combined with the fact that

one had to commence operations from almost sea-level, renders ascents far more

difficult than in Switzerland. When on the top of Mount Sefton the author was

fortunate enough to see how a pass could be eflected to the Karangarua River in

Westland, and accordingly ten days later he set out with his guide Zurbriggeu to

cross the ranges, and accomplished this journey in three days, after many difhculties

and hardships, over a saddle 7,180 feet above sea-level, which the New Zealand

Government have named the Fitzgerald Pass. This passage could be rendered easy

for tourists by a path being made, and it is only twenty-two miles in length. He

came back over some of the largest glaciers in the Colony, and several high Alpine

passes, when four consecutive nights were spent in the open. Mr. Harper, one of

the New Zealand Government Surveyors, accompanied the expedition on its

return.

     In a few weeks the author proposes to leave for South America to try and
climb the mountain Aconcagua, which rises to a height of about 23,000 feet, and is

--the highest mountain in South America in fact, outside of the Himalayan range

it is the highest mountain in the world. His plan is to proceed from Buenos
Ayres to Mendoza, and thence towards the Cordilleras de los Andes. The party

will consist of Mr. C. L. Barrow, who was with the author in New Zealand ; Mr.

de Trailbrd ; Mr. Stewart Vines ; Mr. Philip Gosse, who will be charged with the
natural history collections which will be made ; and Zurbriggen, with three other

guides and a porter from Switzerland.
     The author intends to cover as much of the country as possible ; to ascend

several peaks ; and to bring back natural history and geological specimens. He

hopes to ascend Aconcagua gradually, moving slowly iipwards and establishing
several camps ; and by leaving one of the party at each camp he expects to keep
up communication and to facilitate the supply of provisions, while at the same
time he hopes to report the ascent to London immediately on reaching the summit

if he should be successful.

                 3. The Teaching of Geography in Relation to History.

                                 By A. W. Andrews.

     The study of the physical geography of a country should proceed and be co-
extensive with that of its history.

      The ideal of history teaching in English schools,

   A lack of perspective in the teaching of English history, owing to the neglect

of physical geography.

     Teachers and writers of school histories may be themselves geographers, but

usually fail to appreciate the standpoint of the student.

     As a consequence, physical geography, or the physical side of history is rele-

gated to special te.\t-books and special lessons, not taught in conjunction with

history.

    A study of physical geography would give the student a firm standpoint for the

appreciation of the events of history, and prevent much of the present confusion.
     At present the teaching of geography in connection with history is chiefly con-

fined to the use of topographical maps.

     Teachers, however, forget that a topographical map is merely a diagrammatic
method of learning statistics relating to the distribution of names.

     The danger of both history and geography being taught as a mere verbal xecoxdi

of statistics.

     The different branches that make up history, such as geography, social life,
literature, parliament, &c., must not be studied in complete isolation.

     There must always in the study of history be comparison and contrast, and
this would be gained in English history by a more detailed study of some half-
dozen periods, e.g.

     (1) The present physical geography of Great Britain in connection with the
viai7i and essential ideas of the history of to-day.

     (2) Some ievr epochs of history studied in sufficient detail for a similarly com-

--prehensive view of the life of the time, as in (1) e.g.

                                  The Times of Chaucer, 1360-1400.

                         physical changes (Cinque Ports); [population in E. & S.];

             --II. Means of Communication Ocean routes, sailing vessels, roads,

                                    expansion of geographical knowledge.

                        IV. Influence of geographical conditions on the ideas of the time.

       AB, knowledge of the main factors that made up life in England at that date

                    grouped round some prominent figure like Chaucer, e.g. : literature,
                     social life, trade, religion, &c., considered not merely as independent
                    streams of knowledge, but as they affected the life of an average per-

                       son at that date.

     Threefold advantages of studying geography and history together.
      (1) It provides a standard of comparison with the past.
      (2) It assists a student to visualise history, i.e. to think of it not merely as a
series of isolated branches of knowledge, but as the diflerent manifestations of a

living people at different epochs.

      (3) It is the one factor of history of which it is impossible to limit the influence.
It is invaluable for teaching the student to think.

   4. The Border-land of British Columbia and Alaska. By E. Odlum.

    In this paper it is shown how the huilding of the transcontinental railway by
the Canadian Pacific Company opened British Columbia, how the rapid influx of

population into the fishing, mining, and lumbering centres led to the study of the
boundaries, and how, especially the goldfields of the Yukon River, which is partly
in Canada and partly in Alaska, forced the question of delimitation on both

--countries.
     The southern cause of dispute viz., the Portland Channel claim, with the
adjacent islands of Mary, Revilla Gegido, Annette, and Gravina, with the
Oolachan fisheries, the Tsimpsen Indians, who removed from Canada to Annette

--Island, and other matters in this area of over 5,000 square miles^ ^was referred to

first in order. Then followed the central or great gold-bearing strip, in which, or

adjacent to which, are the mines of silver. Bow Basin, the Junean, and the

Treadwell, the latter being one of the largest in the world.

     Lastly, the northern portion was considered. This includes the Lynn channel
and the Chilcat and Chilcoot inlets, the whole giving the only waterway from the
Pacific into the north of British Columbia and that portion of Canada north of

lat. 60°.

     The author in the paper gives an account of the excellent climate and the vast
resources of that part of Western Canada. The value of the Chinook winds and
the ' Kuro Siwa ' or Japanese current in modifying the ecast and the Canadian
prairies was indicated.

     The paper sets forth that all matters relating to what is called the disputed
territory are being handled by the two governments in the most friendly spirit.

     Reference was made to the inadequate nature of the British school maps and
geographies in relation to Western and Central Canada, and the speaker athrmed
that this central and western part of the Dominion will yet contain scores of

millions of loyal British people.

               By Andrew J. Herbertson, F.R.S.E., F.R.G.S.

     Every teacher of geography experiences a difficulty in trying to give his pupils a
vivid idea of the various map projections. This is in part overcome by using a
candle and a skeleton hemisphere formed of a wire network of meridians and paral-
lels, and, if possible, with an outline of the continents, such as the author has

recently devised, and Messrs. Philip makf>. By altering the position of the lighted

candle, different projections of the network can be thrown on a flat screen, and the
pupils can see the different distortions of the network that result for themselves,
15y using half a cylinder or half a cone, VJirious cylindrical and conical projections
can be illustrated in the same graphic way.

      7. A New Poindation 3fap of the South Wales Coal District.
                            By B. V. Darbishire, M.A.

    The population maps one sees in atlases are mostly on a comparatively small
scale, and of course are much generalised. The usual method is to show by different
depth of colouring the approximate number of inhabitants to the square mile.
This, of course, is the only method possible when large areas are under considera-
tion. In representing the distribution of population within a small area we shall
be able to do without generalisation, and to deal with, and to show on our map,
the actual facts on which the generalisations for larger areas should be based.

-- --and most important of all to make clear the connection between the physio-

graphy and the anthropogeography of a region.

     The map shown is an attempt in this direction.
    It is reduced from the One-inch Ordnance Map (1 : 63360) to the scale of
1 : 100000, with contours at intervals of 200 feet. On it are inserted all
detached houses, and all villages and towns shown on the Ordnance Map. Of
course a map of this kind does not show the actual number of persons living
on a given area. But it does show clearly various facts which are much more

interesting to the geograplier than mere numerical strength.

     It shows the distribution of human settlements, and it shows how that distri-

bution has been influenced by physical features. It shows tlie difterent nature of
the settlements in industrial districts and in agricultural districts. It brings out
clearly the facts that go to make a great seaport. It even enables us by a study of
the shape of villages and towns to get an idea of the circumstances to which they

owe their origin, and makes clear many other facts which are masked by the
amount of detail shown on the Ordnance Map.

                          TRURSDA Y, SEPTEMBER 17.

     The following Address by the President was read by Professor Goiiner :

When the British Association revisits a town or city, it is tbe laudable custom

of the President of a Section to refer to what was said by his predecessor in the
same chair on the former occasion. I should in any case be disposed to follow this

practice, but I could not choose to do otherwise when I find it was my honoured
friend Professor Jevous who occupied this place in Liverpool in 1870. He was

one of a group which passed away in quick succession, to the great loss of the study
of Economics in tbis country, since each had much promise of further usefulness, and

left us with labours unfultilled. Bagebot, Cairnes, CliH'e Leslie, Fawcett, Jevons,

occupied a large space in the field of economic study, and no one among them
excelled Professor Jevons in tbe vigour and clearness of his analysis or in the sin-
cerity and range of bis speculations. His first work which arrested public attention
was perhaps not so much understood as misunderstood. This busy, bustling, hurrying
world cannot afford time to pause and examine the consecutive stages of a drawn-
out argument, and too many caught up and repeated to one another the notion that
Jevons predicted a speed}' exhaustion of our coalfields, and they and their successors
have since been congratulating themselves on their cleverness in disbelieving the
prophecy. No such prophecy was in truth ever uttered. The grave warning that
was given was of the impossibility of continuing the rate of development of coal
production to which we had been accustomed, of slackening, and even arrested
growth, and of the increasing difficulty of maintaining a prosperity based on the
relative advantages we possessed in the low cost of production of coal ; and this
warning has been amply verified in tbe years that have since passed, as will be at
once admitted by all who are competent to read and understand the significance
of our subsequent experience. But I must not dwell on this branch of Jevons's
work nor on the many other contributions he made to the study of our economic
life. I am concerned with what he said here twenty-si.\; years since.

    At first sight the address of my predecessor may seem loose and discursive but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

viewed in due perspective, it appears a serious inquiry into the apparent failure of
economic teaching to change the course and elevate the standard of our social life,
and an earnest endeavour to impress these principles more strongly on the public

mind so that the future might better the history he reviewed. He referred to the

repeal of the Corn Laws, and owned with regret that the condition of the people
was little changed, that pauperism had scarcely abated, that little forethought was
shown by the industrial classes in preparing for the chances of the future and he

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

868 BEPORT--1896.

evils of improvidence. Jevons was not content to condemn the doles of past

testators ; he wanted the reorganisation of the Hospital service of our towns, so that

as far, at least, as the ordinary and inevitable casualties of sickness and accident are
concerned, they mi^ht be met by the co-operation of workers inspired by motives
of self-reliance instead of by ever open gratuitous service making forethought un-

necessary and even foolish. In this connection it may be noticed that while giving

a hearty welcome to Mr. Forster's Education Act, pai^sed in the same year that he
spoke, he noted with satisfaction that primary education had not been made gra-
tuitous so as to take away another support of prudence. It is strange, too, in the

light of our recent experience, to find him regretting that the task of remodelling
local taxation had not been undertaken, so that local wants might be met by a just
apportionment of their charge and the principles of association of the members of
local communities placed on a firmer basis.

    It will be seen that what really occupied the mind of my predecessor was the

apparent slow success of Economic thinkers in influencing political action, and
we, looking back over the intervening twenty-six years, have certainly no more

cause of congratulation than he felt ; we are forced to ask ourselves the same ques-
tion what is the reason of our apparent failure; we are driven to examine anew

whether our principles are faulty and incomplete or whether the difficulties in their

acceptance, they being sound, lie in the prejudices of popular feeling which politi-
cians fire more re-idy to gratify than to correct.

     I do not pause to meet the charges of inhumanity or immorality which have in
other times been brought against Economists. Jevons pleaded for the benevolence

of Malthus, who might indeed be presumed, as an English clergyman, to be not
altogether inhuman or immoral. In truth everyone wlio has ever had any thought

--five centuries everyone who has ever tried to influence the currents of foreign

-- --trade and such attempts date from an equally remote past has been moved bvsome

train of economic reasoning, and must strictly be classified as an Economist; and

the only difference between such men and those who are more usually recognised
by the name is that the latter have attempted to carry their thoughts a little
further, and have been more busy to examine the links of their own reasoning and
the soundness of their conclusions. The men who attempted to fix wages, to limit

the numbers in special trades, to prohibit or to compel certain specific exports, all
had some notion that they were engaged in doing something to strengthen if not
to improve the better organisation of communities. Even the aims which appear
to us most selfish were disguised as embodying social necessities. ]?ut by the

beginning of the present reign it may be said "that the study of Political Economy

in this country had worked itself free from earlier errors, and it had come to be
believed that the secret of social regeneration lay in the utmost allowance of free-

dom of action to every individual of the community, so far at least as that action

affected himself, coupled with the most complete development of the principle of
self-reliance, so as to bring home to every member, freed from legal restraint on
bis liberty of action, the moral responsibility of self-support and of discharging the
duties, present and to come, of his special position. With this education of
the individual in self-reliance, and with this liberation of the same individualin
the conduct of life, it was held that by certain, if slow, stages the condition
of the community would be improved, and a wholesome reorganisation naturally

effected.

    Whatever view we may now hold of this belief, whether we must discard it as
incomplete or even erroneous, or whether we remain strong in the conviction of its

intrinsic soundness and in tlie possibility of realising the hopes it oHered, it must

still be evident that those who professed it were imbued with the deepest interest

in the well-being of their fellow creatures, and that the aim of all their speculations
was the purification of social life, and its healthy and abundant development.

     Such was the theory more or less openly expressed by Economic thinkers when
the British Association was founded, and the same theory, as I conceive, lay at the
base pf Jevons's address in 1870. Can we hold it now, or must it be recast .'^

     Since 1870 Primary Education has practically been made gratuitous. The
                      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                      869

Legislature had an opportunity for abolishing the mischief of doles, but showed no

inclination to make use of it, and there were even traces of a feeling of favour for

the maintenance of these bequests of the past. The indiscriminate multiplication

of so-called charitable institutions has in no way been reformed, and there is as

great activity as ever in the zeal of those who would mitigate or relieve the effects

of improvidence without touching improvidence itself. As far as the course of

legislation is concerned, it may be feared that it has been directed to diminish

ra'ther than to increase the spirit of self-reliance. Codes of regulations have been

framed for the supervision of the conduct of special industries, and their sphere

has been extended so as to embrace at no distant period, if not now, the whole

industrial communitv. The reformed Poor Law, which was regarded as a great

step in the education of the workman, especially of the agricultural labourer, in

independence, stands again upon its trial, and proposals are at least in the air for

assuring to the aged poor a minimum measure of support without any regard to

the circumstances of their past lives, or to the inevitableness of their condition.

The suggestions made by responsible statesmen have indeed been more limited and

cautious, but it will be acknowledged of those, as of the German system, from which

they may be said to be in some measure borrowed, that they involve a great depar-
ture from that ideal of individual development to which I have referred. Add to this

that there is a movement, which has become practical in many large cities and towns,

for the community itself to engross some forms of industrial activity, and to under-
AHtake in respect of them to meet the wants of their inhabitants.
                                                                      these develop-

ments and more may be summed up as illustrations of Collectivity-- an ideal

which has its advocates and professors, and which looks in the future for regulated

civic and national monopolies instead of unrestricted freedom of individual

activity, and for the supervision and control of those industries which may

remain unabsorbed by state or town. In pursuit of this last conception there

have been put forward not only requirements as to hours and conditions of

labour, but a demand also for a Living Wage or a minimum, below which no

workman shall be paid ; and this principle has been already adopted by some muni-

cipalities in respect of their monopolised industries. The State itself indeed has,

through the popular branch of the legislature, declared more or less clearly in

favour of the same principle in respect of the industries which are conducted in

its service.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 .
   We have not only to acknowledge the continued slowness of politicians to

adopt and enforce the' teaching of Economists such as Jevons contemplated, but

also the rise of another school of Economic thought which competes for, and in

some measure successfully obtains, the attention of the makers of laws. The
Wequestion which has already been suggested thus becomes inevitable.
                                                                                      must

inquire whether the failure of former teaching has not been due to errors in itself

rather than to the indocility of those who have neglected it.
     The greatest difficulty which the teachers of the past have to overcome when

put upon their self-defence lies in the suspicion, or more than suspicion, of an

occupied multitude that their promises have failed. It is thought of them, if it

is not openly said, that they had the ear of legislators for a generation, that the

course and conduct of successive administrations were governed by their principles,

and yet society, as we know it, presents much the same features, and the lifting up
of the poor out of the mire is as much as ever a promise of the future. Some

quicker method of introducing a new order is called for, and any scheme offering
Aan assurance of it is welcomed.
                                      ready answer can be given to much of the

suspicion of failure that is entertained. That freedom of industrial action, which
Weis the first postulate of the Economists, has never been secured.
                                                                      are so much

accustomed to the conditions of our own life that this declaration may seem

strange to many, who  will  say that  at  least  in  England  labour  and trade  are  free
                                                                                                         ;

but it must be admitted, on reflection, that in one great sphere of action the liberty

80 postulated has, for good or bad reasons, never been conceded. The limitations

and restrictions necessarily consequent upon the system of land laws established

among us are not commonly understood, but although much has been done to libe-

rate agriculture from their fetters, its perfect freedom has not been attained. There
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               !

may be free trade in the Uuited Kingdom and free land in the United States,

but the country is yet to be found in which both are realised, and even if
both these requisites were attained the sores of social life would not be

removed unless the spirit of self-reliance were fully developed : and how little has
been done to secure this essential condition of progress ! nay, how much has

been done by law, and still more by usage, to weaken and destroy its power

The Economist of whom I have been speaking may boldly claim that so far as he

has had a free hand, his promises have been realised ; there has been a larger
population with increased means of subsistence and diminished necessity of toil, a
people better housed, better fed, better clothed, with fewer relative failures of self-
support and if the teaching which has been partially adopted has brought about

                                       ;

so much, everything it promised would have been secured had it been fully
followed. If the teaching had been fully followed ? This raises the question

whether there are inherent dirticulties in the nature of man preventing such a con-
summation, and many will be ready with the answer that such difficulties exist,

-- --are permanent and cannot be surmounted. As long as human nature is what it is
   so runs the current phrase men will not see misery without relieving it, they will

not wait to inquire into its cause and whether it could have been prevented, and it

is claimed that this instinct is one of the best attributes of humanity, which we

should not attempt to eradicate. This kind of reply easily catches the popular ear.

It seems generous, sympathetic, humane. But it is based on a view of human

nature being incapable of education which has been and will long be the excuse for
acquiescence in all imperfections and even iniquity ; nor can that be said to be
truly generous, sympathetic, or humane which refuses to inquire into the possi-
bility of curing disease, and prefers the selfishness of self-relief to the patient
endeavour to probe and remove the causes of the sutterings of others. The
Economist of -the past generation would, I think, be justified in repudiating with
warmth the feeble temper which recoils from the strenuousness of endeavouring to
deal with social evils at their origin, and in reprobating the acceptance as inevi-

table of vices we take no pains to prevent. This, however, does not conclude the
whole matter. Even if we did attain the ideal of bringing home to all the members
of the community the fatal consequences of improvidence and vice, should we find
improvidence and vice ever narrowing into smaller and smaller circles, or should we

be confronted with their existence as before, with this difference, that past attempts
to alleviate their miserable consequences would be discredited and abandoned ? I fear
I must here confess to a somewhat faltering faith. That a vigorous enforcement
of the penalties of improvidence would diminish it, is a conclusion justified by
experience as well as suggested by theory ; but that it and its consequences would not
still remain gross and palpable facts is a conclusion I have not the courage to gain-

sav. At all events, I cannot refuse to consider the question whether .something
more than the complete freedom of ^he individual is not necessary for the reforma-
tion of society, and to examine with an open mind any supplementary or alternative
proposals that may be made to reach this end. Yet one thing must be said, and
said with emphasis, of the theory of the Economist. It was a working theory. No

 theory can be accepted even for examination which does not .show a working

organisation of society, and the theory we have had under review has this necessary
 "baracteristic, even if it does not open up a certain way to a perfect reconstruction

 of our social system.
      It will be conceded by the most fearless and thorough-going advocates of the

 liberty of individual development, that it must be supported by large measures of

co-operative action. No individual can by any amount of forethought protect himself
 by himself against the chances and accidents of the future. No onecan tell beforehand

 what is in store for himself in respect of sickness, or accident, or those changes of cir-
 cumstances which may arise from the default of others ; and mutual aid is necessary
 to meet such contingencies. The freedom and activity of association thus indicated
 are in no way inconsistent with the fullest theory of individual responsibility. Nor
 is there any departure from it in the voluntary combination among themselves of
 persons, individually weak, to supervise and safeguard the economic conditions into

 which they may enter with others relatively stronger. A single workman may be
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                               871

powerless to induce his employer to modify in any particular the terms of hia

employment, but when workmen band together they may meet employers as equal

powers. Such liberty of combination is a development and not a limitation of

individual liberty. Another step is taken when the parties to such an arrano^e-

ment as has been suggested seek to make its provisions compulsory on othersjlbe

they workmen or employers, who may enter into  similar        relations                                     and  the  prin-
                                                                                                         ;

ciples of former Economists would generally prompt them to condemn such

attempts at compulsion. The Factory Acts were opposed in this way, although

they rested upon difterent grounds ; for, though in their consequences they affected

the labour of adults, they were propounded for the defence of young persons and

children unable to protect themselves or to be the parties to free contracts. Leo-is-

 lation has, however, been extended to control directly the employment of fully

 responsible persons, and this has been defended by three lines of argument. It is

 urged that when the unchecked liberty of individuals destroys in fact the liberty

 of action of larger multitudes, it is in defence of liberty of action that those

 individuals are controlled. If a sea wall is necessaiy to prevent a large tract from

 being periodically inundated, it cannot be permitted to the owner of a small patch
 along the coast to leave the wall unbuilt along his border, and thus threaten the

 lands of his neighbours with inundation. Again, it is urged that when the over-
 whehning majority of persons engaged in a particular industry, employers and
 employed, are agreed upon the necessity of certain rules to govern the industry, it

is not merely a convenience, but is a fulfilment of their liberty, to clothe with the
sanction of law the regulations upon which they are agreed. Lastly, it is sub-

mitted that there are individuals in whom the sense of responsibility is so weak

and whose development of forethought is so hopeless, that it is necessary the law

should regulate their conduct as it may regulate the conduct of children. I do

not propose to examine in detail these real or apparent limitations of individual

liberty. The first plea appears to me to be sound in principle, though it may often
have been applied to cases not properly coming within it. As to the second, the

convenience of giving to an all but universal custom the force of law is incontestable,

but it is at least doubtful whether this is sufficient to deprive individuals who

deliberately wish to put themselves outside it of the liberty of doing so. Unless

their action could be brought within the first line of argument, sufficient reason for

restraint does not appear. As for the hopeless class whose existence is made a
plea for restrictive legislation, the Economist may forcibly argue that they have

never been left to learn the full force of the lessons of experience, and it is the

impatient interference of thoughtless men and thoughtless laws which allows this

class to be perpetually recruited.

The hmitations of individual liberty, to which I have referred, are familiar to

us, and have obtained a firm hold in our legislation; but we enter upon compara-
tively new ground when we turn to the proposals that an increasing number of

industries should be undertaken and directed by State or Municipality, and that a

minimum and not inadequate subsistence should be assured to all those eno-awed in

such industries, if indeed the principle be not presently extended outsid'e the

monopolies so estiiblished. The ideas which are clothed in the phrases 'The

socialisation of the instruments of industry,' and ' The guarantee of a minimum
wage to all workmen,' appear to involve a complete reorganisation of society, and
an absolute abandonment of the theories of the past. This is not enough to justify

their immediate rejection or their immediate acceptance. The past has not been
so good that we can refuse to look at any proposals, however strange in appearance,

offering a better promise for the future. It has not been so bad that we must
Aabandon its methods in despair, as if no change could be for the worse, if not for
the better.  patient inquirer, feeling his way along the movement of his time,

may even be constrained to accept a patchwork covering of life instead of the ideal

garment woven without seam throughout; or he may be led to see that the
harmony of society, like the harmony of the physical universe, must be the result

of divers forces, out of which is developed a perfect curve.

 countries organised as a national institution, and the complaints that are some-
 times heard as to defects in its administration never extend to a demand for its
 aholition. Jevous, in a careful paper, showed that the same financial success
 which marks our present postal system, must not be expected from the nationalisa-
 tion of the telegraph service, and he dismissed even suggestions for the nationalisa-
 tion of railways. His predictions have been amply verified with respect to the
 telegraph account ; but telegraphs are a national service amongst ourselves, and

 railways are largely nationalised in many continental countries, and in some of our
 own colonies and dependencies. Some of our largest municipalities have under-

 taken the supply of water and of gas, or even of electric light, to the inhabitants,
 and a movement has begun, which seems likely to be extended, of undertaking the
 service of tramways. Demands have also been made for the municipalisation or
 nationalisation of the telephone service.

     It may be said of all the industries thus described as taken over, or likely to be
taken over, by the nation and local communities, that when they are not so taken

 over they require for their exercise special powers and privileges conceded by the
 State or community, and the conditions of such concessions are settled by agree-
ment between the community and the body or bodies exercising such industries.

These conditions may involve the payment of a fixed sum, or of a rent for the
concession, or the terms upon which the services are to be rendered may be
prescribed in a stipulated taritt' of charges, or the amount of profit to be realised
by the concessionaires may be limited with provisions for reduction of charge
when such limit is reached, or it may be required that in working such industries
certain limits of wages shall be observed as the minima to be paid to the work-
men employed upon them. Speaking very broadly, it may be said that the
community delegates or leases the right of practising the industry, and there is no
impassable gulf between prescribing the terras on which a lease shall be worked
and assuming the conduct of the industry leased. There may be difficulties in
the management by a community of a cumbrous and unwieldy undertaking, but
there is no difficulty affecting the organisation of society when the undertaking
must be created and shaped by the community in the first place. The arguments

 against the assumption of such monopolies by State or Local Authorities are those

of expediency, founded on a comparison of gain and loss. It may be urged that

there are more forcible motives of economy on the part of a concessionaire than on
the part of a community working the undertaking itself ; that improvements of
method and reductions of cost will bo more carefully sought; and although such
improvements and reductions might in theory be realised by the workmen and
agents of a community, which would thus secure all the savings effected by them,
yet private interest is quicker in discovery and more fertile in suggestion, and
it is more profitable in the end for the community to allow a concessionnaire to
secure such profits, subject to a stipulation that some part of them should return to
the community in the way either of increased money payment, or of reduced rates

of charge for the services performed. It may be urged that when a community
works an industry itself, it may do so at a loss, thus benefiting those who specially

require its services at the cost of the whole body; but this objection is not peculiar

to undertakings so directly worked. It is a matter of common experience for State

or Municipality to grant important subventions to persons willing to undertake
such works on stipulated terms of service, and such subventions involve a levy
from the whole community for the benefit of those availing themselves of the

services.

    New considerations of great difficulty arise when we pass to the suggestion of

the undertaking by local authorities of productive industries not in the nature of
monopolies. In monopolies direct competition, often competition in any shape,
is practically impossible ; in other industries competition is a general rule ; and it is
by virtue of such competition that the members of the community do in the long

run obtain their wants supplied in the most economical manner. When com-

modities are easily carried without serious deterioration, the constantly changing
conditions of production and of transport induce a constant variation in the sources

--of cheapest supply that is of supply under conditions of least toil and eff'ort

and any arrest of tliis mobility involves a corresponding set-back in the advance-

ment of the economic condition of mankind. It is a necessary consequence

of this process that the local production of special commodities should be subject

to diminution and extinction, and that the labours hitherto engaged in such local

production should become gradually worthless. Quite as much labour as before

might be expended in achieving the result, but it would be misapplied ; it

ouo-ht not to command the same return ; it should cease. It is at least difficult to

foresee how for the production of commodities exposed to free competition could
be maintaioed by communities themselves in face of the movement we have

described. There would be a danger of pressure to do away with invasive com-

--petition action which, in my judgment, would be destructive of the most powerful

cause of improvement in the condition of the people. There would be an allied

danger of a refusal to recognise the possibility of a diminished worth of work
which remains as toilsome as ever, and of an increasing congestion of labour when
the great movement of the world demands its dispersion. It may be that those

evils are not inevitable, but they would require to be faced if any serious attempt

were made to increase the range of national or municipal industries, and I have not

yet seen any attempt at their serious investigation.

The position thus taken may be illustrated by an experience to which I have

elsewhere referred, but so pregnant with suggestion that I need not apologise for

Myrecalling it.  native county, Cornwall, was in my boyhood the scene of wide-

spread activity in copper and tin mining. There had not been wanting warnings

that the competition of richer deposits in far countries would put an end to these

industries in the county, but the warnings had not been realised and remained

unheeded. In the years that have since passed they have been gradually and

almost completely fulfilled. There are no copper mines now in Cornwall, and the

tin mines, which were scattered far and wide throughout the county, are reduced

to two or three within one limited area. It is not the case that the ores have

been exhausted ; they could still be raised, but at a cost of production making the

process unprofitable. The mines were abandoned one by one, and the population

of the county has steadily diminished in every recent census. What would the

experience have been had the mines been a county or national property worked by

county or nation ? I do not stop to comment on the difficulty of expropriating

present owners, which, however, must not be forgotten. If the collective owner

had leased the mines to companies of adventurers (to use the local phrase), the

lessees would have gradually relinquished their concessions, as they have done

when taking them from private owners. Nor would the case have been materially

different even if the collective owner had introduced the novel stipulation into his

leases that the working miners should be paid according to prescribed rates of

wages. The process of relinquishment might have been precipitated and accelerated

by insisting on such a condition, but otherwise the experience would have been the

same. The shrinkage of industry would go on without a check, and it is to be

hoped that the workmen who found their work failing would, with the fine courage

and enterprise they have in fact shown, have betaken themselves to the fields of

mining industry displacing their own in all parts of the world. Can one think that

the same process would have been maintained had the collective owner worked

the mines directly, and the working men looked to county or nation for the con-

tinuance of work and wages ? The attachment which all men have for the homes

of themselves and their fathers would have stimulated a demand for a recurrence

to the other resources of the collective owner for the maintenance of an industry

that was dying. Some demand might even be made for a repression or prohibition

of that competition which was the undoing of the local industry. These possi-

bilities may be regarded as fanciful, and it is true that forces might be kept under

control that operated within an area and affected a population relatively so

limited. But what if the warnings of Jevons respecting coal in England proved like

the warnings of the men who foresaw the cessation of tin mining in Cornwall, and

the community had to deal with the problem of the dwindling coal industry in

face of nationalised coal mines and armies of^workmen employed by the nation ?

The initial difficulties of the nationalisation of that which for centuries has been

the subject of private property are formidable, but they could doubtless be overcome

by the short and simple process of confiscation. This transformation is theoretically

conceivable. It is in the subsequent development of the scheme of nationalised and

municipalised industries that we are confronted with tasks not so easy of solution.

How is its working to be reconciled with that opening up of more and more pro-

Howductive fields which is one of the prime factors of social progress ?  is the

allotment of men to be directed so that they maj' be shifted about as new centres

open and old centres close ? What checks or commands can be invoked to restrain

the growth of population in a district when it should be dwindling? These are
questions that can scarcely be put aside, and it may even be acknowledged that

they gain fresh force when viewed in the light of another experience. Agricul-

tural industry has recently been subjected to severe trials through a great breadth

of this country. This has been due to cheaper importations from other lands, and

though the competition has in my judgment been aggravated by causes into which

I will not now digress (which aggravation however might and should be dealt

with), the importation of food at less cost is a result no Economist will regard

as otherwise than beneficial to the community as a whole. It is well that

bread and flesh and the sustenance of life should be procured with as little toil as

possible, however severe the trial for those who have been engaged hitherto in
Wethe production of those necessaries.
                                                               know that it has been so severe that

demands for relief and assistance have been loudly made, and their power has been

such as to have been in some measure successful ; but had land been nationalised

and farms held from the State or from county, town, or parish, they would have

assumed a different shape, have been urged with greater purpose, and have received

larger treatment. The difficulties of such a nationalised industry, passing into what

may be described as a water-logged condition, w^ould test beyond the straining point

such statesmanship as our experience warrants us to believe possible.

However much we may contemplate the reconstruction of an industrial system,

it must, if it is to be a living social organism, be constantly responsive to the ever-

changing conditions of growth ; some parts must wax whilst others wane, extend-
ing here and contracting there, aud manifesting at every moment those phenomena

of vigour and decline which chai'acterise life. In the development of industry new

and easier ways are constantly being invented of doing old things places are
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

being discovered better suited for old indu-^itries than those to which resort had

been made                                            there is  a continuous supersession of the worth of known processes and
                                                  ;

of the utility of old forms of work involving a supersession, or at least a transfer, of

the labour hitherto devoted to them. All these things compel a perpetual shifting

of seats of industry and of the settlements of man, and no organisation can be enter-

tained as practicable which does not lend itself to those necessities. They are the

pre-requisites of a diminution of the toil of humanity. As I have said before, the

theory of individual liberty, however guarded, afforded a working plan ; society

could and did march under it. The scheme of collective action gives no such

promise of practicability ; it seems to lack the provision of the forces which should

bring about that movement upon which growth depends. The Economist of the

past generation still holds his ground, and our best hope lies in the fuller accept-

ance of his ideas. Such, at least, appears to me to be the result of a dispassionate

inquiry                                but what may be wanting is something more than a dispassionate temper--
                                    ;

a certain fervour of faith. The Economist must feel, if he is to animate multitudes

and inspire legislatures, that he, too, has a religion. Beneath the calmness of his

analysis must be felt the throb of humanity. Slow in any case must be the secular

progress of any branch of the human family ; but if we take our stand upon facts,
if our eyes are open to distinguish illusions from truth, if we are animated by the

single purpose of subordinating our investigations and our actions to the lifting up

of the standard of living, we may possess our souls in patience, waiting upon the

promise of the future.

1. Some Economic Issues in regard to Charitable or Philanthropic

                        Trading. By C. S. Loch.

Philanthropic trading is, for the purposes of this paper, defined as trading

undertaken, in the case of a municipality, to provide, not the common wants of

the community, but those of its individual members. The definition thus excludes

trading in gas or water, but includes, for instance, the supply of artisans'

dwellings or municipal common lodging houses. In the case of institutions

philanthropic trading is defined as trading undertaken to supply the general

market, whether with the object primarily of reforming or occupying inmates or

dependents, or solely with the purpose of raising funds.

Of the relation of philanthropic trading to the use of capital and credit three

examples are given : the provision of dwellings for artisans and labourers by the

municipality, and the methods adopted, one by the Salvation Army, and one by a

philanthropic home, in order to raise capital.

    By detailed reference to the Goldsmith's Row and Boundary Road schemes of

the London County Council, it is shown that, in accordance with the general

evidence on the subject, there is loss on the purchase of land when it is utilised

for artisans' dwellings in  the centre of                                                                                                                  Loudon                                  that  those  displaced                       by a scheme
                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

do not return to occupy the new buildings ; and that the system competes with

private agencies, who, if they take the land at all for artisans' dwellings, will only

do 80 at such specially reduced rates as will enable them to make a profit.

The one economic result of this philanthropic trading is to undersell the capital

and credit of the ordinary trader, who practically pays in diminished business for

--the advantage which the community receive namely, the difference between the

2J or 3 per cent, at which the London County Council, with the credit of the
community behind it, can raise money and the 4J or 5 per cent, that the private
capitalist would require. Other results are to cause waste, consisting (1) of the

difference between the value of the land in the market and its value when

reserved for artisans' dwellings                                                                                                                     (2) of the continuing loss                             on  the site, for though
                                                                                                                                                  ;

lesser rate than it would if the site were used for commercial purposes                                                                                                                                                                                                                            (3) of the

loss due to misdirection, since, after all, the dwellings do not as a rule provide

for the very poor, but for the better class, who secure a better article at the usual

rates of rental prevailing in the neighbourhood. For all these forms of waste the

ratepayer has to pay. Socially, the system is wrong, as it tends to increase the

density of the population instead of spreading it over a larger area. And the

supply of house accommodation does not, in fact, demand State or municipal

intervention more than the supply of food or clothing. In the former case the

market lies at hand  or  the  goods                                                                                                                  ai'e  brought                                 to  the  house                           in  the                                                latter  the

market, the cheaper accommodation, has to be sought (always a difficult matter

with the poor) in the cheaper districts in the outskirts of the town.

' General ' Booth's loans at 4i per cent, are next referred to. In this case

spiritual credit is used for the philanthropic trading of the Salvation Army, which

undertakes to ' supply shopkeepers at wholesale prices^ &c. The parallel is drawn

between the conditions of municipal trading and of such phiLnthropic trading

as this.

    Of philanthropic retail trading four instances are given : the supply of common
lodging houses, the Salvation Army tea trade, the depots of the Church Extension

Association, and the free or part-pay supply of medicine and medical advice in

out-patient departments.

    In the philanthropic supply of common lodging houses by the municipality the

--ratepayer pays twice over first to meet waste of the kind referred to above in

connection with the capital expenditure, and next in order to maintain the persons

who resort to these institutions, and immediately or soon after apply for relief
from the rates. This is shown in detail in the case of the Blackfriars shelter of
the Salvation Army and from evidence from Manchester and Whitechapel.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   3 l2

    The Salvation Army tea trade is lucrative. They supply (with a philanthropic

capital) 'the best possible teas at the lowest price at which they can be purchased

elsewhere.' But those who pledge themselves (as they are asked to do) to buy
their teas do not thereby themselves pay towards the support of the Army.
Those who actually pay are the merchants and others who are engaged in the tea
trade, whose business is philanthropically diverted, and who are thus made to
contribute to the funds of the Salvation Army not merely without their consent

but to their detriment.
     In regard to the philanthropic employment of labour in institutions, instances

are given showing the economic and social results of such interference upon
unskilled labour, and the principles that should limit and guide its introduction

are stated.

      3. Les Crises Commerdales. By Monsieur Clement Juglar.

     Statistics indicative of commercial activity during long periods of time exhibit
an ebb and flow extending over a variable number of years, and due to some
powerful force acting continuously in the same direction for a considerable time.

The movement so observed is more or less uniform in all countries at the same
time. The circulation of banks in England, France, and America, since 1800
affords an example. The cyclical period is not constant, but the credit-movement
--

shows a succession of stages of expansion, shock (or crisis), contraction (or liquida-
tion), stagnation, and renewed expansion. The crash oi' the Copper Syndicate,
of the Panama Canal Company aud the Baring crisis tit in with a movement of

this kind.

    The International Institute of Statistics had propounded the question, What

is the best measure of the economic condition of a nation ? The consumption of
coal, iron, and corn, had been suggested as the measure; but these are partial at
best. The credit circulation, on the contrary, embraces the whole industrial and
commercial activity of the country, cash and credit alike, for the second carries

with it the first.

   A remarkable confirmation of the pervading power of credit is afforded by

diagrams showiug the number of marriages and births in London and Paris, in
France, England, Germany, Prussia, Austria, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland. These
expand and contract with striking similarity, increasing in good times when credit
is active, contracting in bad times when credit is diminishing or sluggish. Similar
diagrams of the number of deaths show no such concordance with the movements of

credit, because, unlike credit, they are largely determined independently of

human volition, though the minimum on this curve usually occurs in a period of

prosperity.

     The assessment of the poor rate, to which nearly all other English rates are

now mere additions, was originally founded on the principle of ability to pay,

and that principle has never been expressly repudiated. But the successive steps
by which it has been practically abandoned have been called for by public opinion,

aud, in spite of complaints, loud rather than dejp, the present system is generally

approved.

raised by local taxation, in order to secure economy and etiiciency of administra-
tion. The making of this expenditure a local charge is in it.self a negation of
the principle of taxation according to ability, and the only question is whether
an attempt should be made to re-establish in each locality a principle which
has been abandoned as regards the nation as a whole. The answer is in the
negative. Most people migrate before reaching the prime of life, and the effect
of their consideration where to settle is to equalise the advantages and dis-
advantages of different localities as places of business and residence. Local
taxation is a disadvantage duly taken into account, and con.=equently, no matter
what it is laid upon in the first instance, it tends to reduce the value of the land
and other fixed property of the locality. This being the case, it is expedient to
levy it directly in respect of such property. Even, therefore, if all local expendi-
ture were of this class, ability would not be the proper basis of local taxation.

      But by far the greater portion of modern local expenditure is of a class to
 which it would be unjust as well as inexpedient to apply the principle of taxation
 according to ability, either locally or nationally. The principle is approved in
 the case of national taxation, because the benefits produced by the national expendi-
 ture are of such a kind that their di.stribution cannot be traced and their amount
 measured. The ideal commonly held is practically equal distribution modified by
 differences of need, and this communistic principle has its natural counterpart in
 payment according to ability. But the greater portion of modern local expendi-
 ture is calculated (owing to the competition between localities) to produce com-
 mensurable pecuniary benefits to the owners of land and other fixed property.
878 REPORT-- 1896.

The proper principle of contribution is therefore not the communistic one of pay-
ment according to ability, but the joint-stock principle of payment according to

share or interest.

2. Some Observations on the Distribution and Incidence of Rates and Taxes ;

    with special reference to the transfer of charges from the former to the
    latter. By G. H. Blunden.

Expenses of kinds formerly provided for by the levy of rates are now met by

the imposition of Imperial taxation to the amount of 8,000,000/. (including

Who1,000,000/. transferred by the Agricultural Rates Act, 1896).                                                                 gains by the

consequent reduction of the rates, and who loses by the corresponding imposition

of taxes ?

    Calculations have been made which show that the payers of Income Tax con-
tribute 29 per cent, of the rates as occupiers of houses, and 31 per cent, as

property-ovraers and consumers ; or 60 per cent, in all. Non-payers of Income
Tax are shown to pay 32 per cent, of the rates as occupiers of houses, and 8 per

cent, as property-owners and consumers ; or 40 per cent, in all. Of the rates levied,
12-6 per cent, are borne by certain kinds of real property, 12-1 per cent, by some
forms of personal property, and 75-3 per cent, by the community as occupiers and
consumers. Much of both real and personal property does not contribute.

     Of the Imperial taxes levied, 3 per cent, is borne by real property, 10-4 per
cent, by other rateable property, 16-2 per cent, by non-rateable property, 5-5 falls
on the earnings of personal exertion, as such ; and 64-9 on the consumers of taxed

commodities. One-half of the Imperial taxes are contributed by the classes who
fall below the Income Tax standard.

     The transferred charges prior to 1896 are held to have fallen equally on the
payers of Income Tax and the consumers of tea, coffee, cocoa, and dried fruits. As
between those who pay Income Tax and those who do not, the shares of the burden
remain practically unaltered. But those of the former class who own rate-bearing
property gain largely at the expense of those who do not ; and the share of the

latter class is less evenly distributed among its members, to the disadvantage of

the poorer of them.

     The Agricultural Rates Act reduces the quota of the rates borne by real pro-
perty from 12-6 per cent, to 7'6 per cent. The cost of the transfer falls upon the
whole community.

3. Proposed Modifications of the Rating System. By W. H. Smith.

The changes in local taxation usually proposed involve financial questions that

are matters of controversy                                                                                                       but the rating system ought to continue in some form
                                                                                                                              ;

the main source of local revenue, and it is probable that many grievances alleged

against it can be mitigated by modifications of the system which may be viewed

as the development, rather than the supersession, of the broader principles upon

which it rests. Thus, it should be observed that the primary question arising

is one between the persons interested in competing properties, and not between

those who are variously interested in a single property. Changes, mostly unfore-

seen, occur in the relative values of properties put to similar uses. These changes,

which necessitated ' reassessment,' speedy in their operation, demand that reassess-

ment be associated, not with ' an equal £ rate,' but with a rate which, cceteris jjaribm,
would vary more widely than the rateable value varies. To the grievance of the

ratepayer as tradesman, there is added his complaint as private householder. As

such, he occupies property whose value depends much on the building as dis-

tinguished from the site. Moreover, as one descends socially, the demand for

house accommodation becomes ineffectual more rapidly than the demand for other

comparative necessaries. It is to be considered whether this is in any measure a

Aresult of the present distribution of local taxation.                                                                           question also arises as to

the effect, as regards the individual ratepayer, of the subsidies received by local

authorities in the shape of profits from undertakings.

              4. Farm Labour Colonies and Poor Latv Guardians.
                             By Harold E. Moore, F.S.I.

      With the experience now gained it is possible to divide Farm Labour Colonies
 into two distinct classes. The first may be considered to be colonies for the reception
 of well-conducted men of the working classes temporarily out of employment.
 These colonies can be made self-supporting if managed under proper conditions, as
 appears from the evidence collected by Mr. W. Mather, then M.P. for the Gorton

 division of Lancashire, and placed before the Parliamentary Committee on the
 Uneinployed, in the scheme which that gentleman advocated for the foundation of

 colonies for this class from national resources.

      The second class of colonies may be considered to be those for the reception of
 men who would otherwise be in the casual wards or inmates of v/orkhouses. This

 kind of colony must be worked either by Boards of Guardians or in close connection
 with the same. The advantages claimed for such colonies are the reduction in cost

 of Poor Law Relief, and the giving of more hope to those engaged than if they

 were employed in other classes of forced labour. Old enactments not yet repealed
 give Boards of Guardians power to take land not exceeding fifty acres for each

 parish and to pay wages for working the same. At the time of passing the Poor

Law Act of 1834 many such farms were in operation. To continue this class of

 work was, however, contrary to the spirit of that Act, and has been discouraged.
 In 1894, however, the Local Government Board consented to consider any
schemes submitted by Guardians for providing employment on land. The
proposals made by various Boards seem to have been either («) to allow part of
the cost of men sent to colonies under private control to be paid by Guardians ; or

 (b) to sanction acquirement of land to be worked by paid labour ; or (c) to permit
the acquirement of small areas mainly for purposes of test work. The first-named

proposition has been approved, the second rejected, and the third has received

favourable consideration.

     These decisions of the Local Government Board seem to have been generally
prudent, for if land is to be worked for the class named it must be (a) largely
waste land, to admit of the employment of intermittent and unskilled labour {b)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

not of such a size as to involve usual farm risks; (c) used only for growth of such

crops as can be consumed in the workhouses or by the men employed; {d)
managed on a system giving a reward for labour on the basis of piece-work. The

xperience quoted showed if these considerations were adhered to the cost of Poor
Relief would be lessened with benefit to the men helped. More especially has this
been the case where assistance of Guardians has been in the nature of a subsidy to

colonies carried on by voluntary committees. An extension of this system can,

therefore be recommended, especially in view of the recommendations of the
Parliamentary Report on the Unemployed, published in July 1896.

          6. The Decay of British Agriculture : its Causes and Cure.
                                 By Charles Rintoul.

     The decay of agriculture may be attributed to the abolition of the Corn Laws in
1846, which Act was a security to the farmer for the safe investment of his capital

and labour in producing food for the nation. This did not immediately follow, as
trade and manufacture, which were languishing under the Corn Laws, became
very prosperous, together with several other reasons, but as soon as the prairie
lands of virgin soil abroad were broken up and reaped with the labour-saving
string-binder, and produce sent into this country at very low freights, the exhausted
and clay lands, which then could not compete, began to become derelict. Large

tracts are thrown out of cultivation, and labourers who formerly produced food

880 REPORT-- 1896.

Bupplies are driven into towns to compete with ·wage-earners there, or to emigrate,

and thus their services are lost to the country. Three important remedies:

First: That rents should he adjusted in accordance with the prices, and that

permanent improvements executed by the tenantry sliould be secured to them.

Second: That all city refuse be returned to the soil to lestore fertility. This is

being done in Glasgow at a profit, details of which are given in the paper.

Government ought to assist in making this universal. The fertilising matter at

present cremated, or thrown into the sea, is a national lo.ss, and could be turned

Ainto a national gain. Third:  national system of reclamation of all suitable

tidal wastes, to provide virgin soil and marsh pastures, so that the r«w material

now necessary for successful agriculture be kept up. Some details of what has been

accomplished in Scotland and Holland are given. In the event of war, the limited

supply of home produce and steady increase of population in this country arti

regarded as serious, and ought to be provided for.

           1. Metric Measures and our Old System. By F. Toms.

    The metric system of weights and measures will doubtless be legalised in this
country before long. But, admirable as this system is for scientific purposes and

large commercial transactions, the decimal divisions are not well adapted to the

small dealings which prevail among the less educated portion of the comoiunity,
who form the great mass of the British nation. In legalising the new code, how-
ever, there is no need to sweep away the method now in force, as the two systems
may be combined, and the retention of old forms will make our untaught popula-
tion familiar with new principles.

     Our English measures may be made to accord with the French by dividing

the metre into eleven equal parts and taking ten of those parts as the basis of
our yard. The divisions and multiples of our old system could be retained as
heretofore, the only ditlerence being that inches, feet, yards, turlongs, &c., would
all be reduced by a small fraction (006). This done, the metres would be

exactly converted into yards when multiplied by I'l, and ya'.'ds would be con-
verted into metres when divided by I'l. A* the same time, the complications of
our present land measures would be simplified.

   A somewhat similar course might be taken with weights and measures of

--capacity old names being applied to new equivalents. If half a kilogramme be

taken as the new pound, and half a dekalitre as the new gallon, their divisions
and multiples would follow the same course as that now in vogue, and retain the

same nomenclature.

 2. Orcein Fatures, their Effects and Tendencies. By H. R. Ratiibone.

      Futures trading, or ' options ' as they are generally called, has been of recent
growth in the grain trade, and has only during the last ten years exercised a para-

mount influence on the trade. Its introduction has increased the tendency already
in operation to reduce the margin of profit iu distribution to a minimum. Owing
to the tendency of speculators to overtrade the margin is generally against the
importer, and, except under rather unusual circumstances, the cost of distribution
is borne chiefly by the speculators. In America, where the system has reached a
perfection unknown elsewhere, the option-market is the invariable basis of trading
both for the farmer, the distributor, and the miller. In fact, the option-market is
looked upon by the trader as a sort of insurance system. The rapidity with which
the trade can be executed in these speculative markets has invited operators from
all parts of the world, and undoubtedly during the great fall in prices since 1891,
the world used the American markets in which to insure their holdings. But it is
quite impossible to prove that this fall in values was brought about by option-
trading, although a natural fall is accentuated just as a rise is by the existence of
the option-market. On the other hand, it may easily be shown that much of the
shrinkage in values is due to a fall in freight both ocean and inland.

     It is evident that this speculative trading by reducing margins and by making
large operations less risky and dangerous is steadily concentrating the grain trade
of England into fewer and fewer hands. There are unmistakeable signs that this
concentration may eventually take the form of large trusts or syndicates for the
distribution of our breadstutfs. As long as England follows her Free Trade prin-
ciples, it is unlikely that any such abuse of their powers will be possible as we are

familiar with in protectionist America. And the hope of the Fabian, that such

trusts are only the stepping-stones to the nationalisation of commerce, if not
brought about by abuse, is still less likely to be brought about on the ground of
economy. For, as long as mankind remains what it is, with an inherent, insatiable
passion for speculation, I can imagine no cheaper means for distribution than that
in which option-trading plays so important a part.

     3. Cotton Futures, ivhat they are, and hoiv they operate in Practice.

                                By Charles Stewart.

     Avoiding trade technicalities where possible, and explaining them where
unavoidable, the paper commences by a description of what a Cotton Futures con-

tract is, its method of working as a contract in suspense and at maturity, and how
differences in value are adjusted through the medium of the Clearing House of

the Liverpool Cotton Association.

     The subject is afterwards separated into two divisions : the utility of Cotton
Futures as ' Hedges,' first as sales, second as purchases. The sales are again
divided : 1st. As sales by planters in order to secure a favourable current price
while the crop is growing, the feature dwelt upon being that such a sale can
always be immediately effected, and a ruling good or fair price instantaneously
secured. 2nd. The sales of Futures by importers as a hedge against shipments,

this operation fully protecting the value interest not only of the importer while
the cotton is in transit or in the warehouse, but also the interest of the banker.

financing the bills of exchange drawn for the v<alue of the shipment. This feature

is specially emphasised as an insurance against loss in value in a declining market,
it being pointed out that without such protection cotton importing would be a

sheer gamble and speculation. 3rd. The sales of Futures by spinners, manufac-

turers, and their agents against accumulated and accumulating stocks of yam and
cloth in times when from temporary and local causes production is ahead of

 demand.
      The purchase of Cotton Futures as a hedge is divided into two sections : 1st.

As purchases by shippers against contracts made for forward delivery, during such

time as their agents, spread over the cotton belt, can lay their hands upon the

actual specialties required. 2nd. As purchases by spinners against contracts made
for forward delivery of yarn, by manufacturers against contracts made for forward

delivery of cloth, and their agents, it being pointed out that after a sale is effected

on a recognised basis a cover-purchase of practically equivalent value can be made

immediately, the question of selection being a matter of detail and convenience.
     The fideHty of contracts is explained, also the rapidity and facility of effecting

either sale or purchase, Cotton Futures being designated as the consols of produce.
It is claimed that the system of dealing in Futures is the natural outcome of the
expansion of trade, particularly the feature of the development of such by tele-
graphy. The increase in the size of the crops, the small margin of present-day
profits, the greater speed in transit, the increased magnitude of producing con-
cerns, the necessarily greater increase in the capital for their requirements, are all
demonstrated. Throughout the paper ignores theory or fallacy, and is devoted to
a simple explanation of practice.

     4. The Influence of Business in Futures on Trade and Agriculture,

                                   By J. SiLVERBERG.

      Agitation against the system of dealing in produce for future delivery ia

--America, England, and Germany. The opponents allege that

     1. The system of selling fictitious produce is the cause of the decline and of
constant low prices.

     2. That the system overrules the law of supply and demand.
      3. That statistical figures prove this contention.
     4. They stigmatise the magnitude of these transactions, which they brand as
gambling.
     5. They produce evidence from their supporters.

     As against these it is argued that the system operates as part of the law of

supply and demand.
     The statistics are unreliable.
     The magnitude of the transactions in futures is immense.

     Futures may be classed as follows :

      1. Speculation pure and simple is only a comparatively small part. It is diffi-
cult to trace and to distinguish it from other business ; it is impossible to legislate
against it and to stop it.

     2. Selling against imports, called ' hedging,' quite legitimate and supremely non-

speculative.

     3. ' Jobbing ' transactions, balancing one another mostly on the same day, and
not to be deprecated, having the advantage of creating a broad market.

      4. ' Straddling ' transactions not altering the position, being identical with
transposing quantities from one side of an arithmetical equation to the other, by
changing the signs.

     Evidence given by opponents mostly biassed and contradictory ; they plead their

own cause, while pretending to pose as public benefactors.
     Dealers and importers of the old school are speculators, while the importer now-

adays finds in the system the means of eliminating the element of speculation. The
system moves the crops with ease and safety, draws them to our ports, and makes
these the centres of distribution, which is a great benefit.

                                                                       ·

     The influence of the system on agriculture is salutary :
     1. It furnishes buyers at a time when supplies are enormous and a congestion

likely to occur.

     2. It increases the number of buyers, which is always an advantage to sellers.

     3. It briogs consumers into closer contact with producers, and the saving
hereby effected benefits producers.

     4. It engenders speculative investments by capitalists.

     5. It_ ensures banking facilities to the small shippers, and thus increases

competition.

     6. \t gives producers the cardinal advantage of making produce at all times
a readily saleable commoditj'.

  7.  It                                        has a decidedly levelling effect  on  prices, while  the abuses, such  as  arti-

_

ficial depression or artificial inflation, are only rare occurrences, and have only a

temporary effect.

The low price of produce is due to natural causes, ruled by the inexorable law

of supply and demand, and the trading in futures has nothing to do with it.

' Bear                                          selling  is  too sweepingly condemned by the         opponents ;  on  the con-
                             '

trary, it very frequently acts beneficially.

     In summing up, the conclusion is reached that the system of dealing in futures

is a branch of business with which, under modem conditions of trade, we cannot

dispense; and that the excrescences and abuses are insignificant compared with

the advantages which it confers on trade and agriculture.

1. The Currency Question in the United States and its bearing on British

                             Interests. By Arthur Lee.

     Recent developments of the currency question in the United States have rudely

dispelled many illusions. Both great parties bimetaUist: the Republicans

declare for international bimetallism ; the Democrats for national bimetallism.

No proper gold monometallist party now in the United States. The attitude of

England towards international bimetallism a potent factor in the development of

strength of the free silver party.

In whatever way struggle results it will vitally affect British interests:

1. If the Republicans win, by operation of a new McKinley tariff" especially

hostile to British trade; by non-settlement of silver question and four years of

continual agitation ; by prospect of free silver victory in 1900 and consequent

uncertainty as to future. 2. If Democrats win, by reduction in exchangeable value

of gold                                         by increase in  exchangeable value of silver ;  by a violent change in

relative values of gold and silver, and consequently of the three standards of value

now in existence in British Empire.

Can the United States alone make a coinage ratio of 16 to 1 effective? Opinion

generally held in this country that they cannot do so. Not supported on any

definite scientific ground. Factors in the problem : Amount of gold now in the

States how                                      much     of this  can  be absorbed by gold-standard countries ; how
                               ;

much silver will probably rise and gold will probably fall. Argument of those

who maintain that ratio cannot be made effective. Effect of throwing one-seventh

total world's stock of gold for silver without bringing market ratio of precious
metals below 16 to 1. Probability that the United States will retain large pro-
portion of her present holding of gold. In that case coinage ratio of 1(3 to 1 will be

British Empire in stability of ratio between gold and silver money. But sudden
change will work terrible disturbance. Will atl'ect British Empire more than any

agreement.

although injurious to producing classes. But this class benefit dependent on

lack of gold or of standard money (state of banks, treasuries, &c.). Standard
money less and less used in trade. Increased output of gold.

   --What is Price? The fundamental question. It is the record in money of a

bargain depending on markets, not on supplies of money. Prices may affect
money, not money prices (Giffen). Money a measure and not creator of price.
Price affected by money supply only in case of alarm. If credit maintained,
prices not so ati'ected, e.g., dear money and high prices 1864-67. At present time
 cheap money and low prices. (This true, though word money often used in
different senses.) Supply and demand of goods real source of changes of price.

   --Lotv Prices chiefly due to Excess of Supplies caused by (1) inventions, cheap

carriage, cheap production. (2) Increase of capital applied to production by
 (a) limited liability, (6) capital set free by changes in trade (telegraphs, &c.).

-- --(c) Accumulations. (3) Special case of silver great supplies lessened demands

 owing to demonetisation caused by great supplies. Fall in prices irregular, but
 if caused by want of gold should act on all alike, e.g., minerals and wheat fallen

 much and meat little. The causes affecting them must be contrasted. Wages

 have risen though labour is a commodity. Gold depreciated as against labour.

   --Allegation that Low Price of Silver affects (a) Prices, (h) Trade. (1) It

 affects exports from silver-using countries, e.g., imports of wheat from India.
 Russia and Argentine (paper) and U.S A. (gold) aiow rule our markets as to
 grain. (2) Cheap silver discourages our exports to silver countries (silver prices).

 exports to silver countries (Whitehead). Our real rival in the East as to our

              3. The Monetary Standard. By Major L. Darwin.

     In this paper the author discusses the law which it is desirable that a metallic
standard of value should follow with reference to the price of commodities.
Taking the case of stagnant trade, when tlie production of commodities is neither
increasing nor diminishing, he shows that objectionable results will arise if the
standard is one which either tends to raise or to depress prices. Taking the case
of progressive trades, there are two standards to be considered, one which tends to

keep the price of the output per man per day constant, and the other which tends

to keep the price of the commodities produced constant. These standards are
compared under certain hypothetical conditions (also assumed in the case of
stagnant trade), and it is shown that both have merits, but that the standard of
constant price of output is on the whole the best. But in considering the various

--facts of real life, omitted in such hypothetical discussions such as the variations

in prices due to causes other than currency causes, the effect of charges of the
nature of mining royalties, and the influences which tend to revive trade in

--periods of depression all these circumstances show the desirability of keeping up

prices at a higher level than these theoretical discussions would indicate as ad-
visable. Thus in times of progressive trade it would seem best that the standard

--should tend to keep prices between the two extremes above mentioned that it

should make the price of commodities fall, and the price of the average output of
human labour rise, the latter perhaps more than the former.

                 Section G.--MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

--President of the Section Sir Doijgias Fox, Vice-President of the Institutioa

                                                       of Civil Engineers.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.

     The President delivered the following address :

It is rather over a quarter of a century since the British Association last held
its meeting in the hospitable city of Liverpool. The intervening period has been

one of unparalleled progress, both generally and locally, in the many branches of

knowledge and of practical application covered by Civil and Mechanical Engi-
neering, and therefore rightly coming within the limits for discussion in the

important Section of the Association in which we are specially interested.

     During these twenty-five years the railway system of the British Isles, which
saw one of its earliest developments in this neighbourhood, has extended from
15,376 miles, at a capital cost of 552,680,000/., to 21,174 miles, at a capital cost of
1,001,000,000/. The railway system of the United States has more than trebled

in the same period, and now represents a total mileage of 181,082, with a capital

cost of 1^11,565,000,000.

     The Forth and Brooklyn, amongst bridges, the Severn and St. Gothard,
amongst tunnels, the gigantic works for the water-supply of towns, are some of
the larger triumphs of the civil engineer ; the substitution of steel for iron for so
many purposes, the perfecting of the locomotive, of the marine engine, of hydraulic
machinery, of gas and electric plant, those of the mechanical branch of the pro-

fession.

     The city of Liverpool and its sister town of Birkenhead have witnessed
wonderful changes during the period under review. Great and successful efforts
have been made to improve the Watergate to the noble estuary, which forms the
key to the city's greatness and prosperity ; constant additions have been made to
the docks, which are by far the finest and most extensive in the world. The
docks on the two sides of the river have been amalgamated into one great trust.
In order properly to serve the vast and growing passenger and goods traffic of the
port, the great railway companies have expended vast .lums on the connections
with the dock lines and on the provision of station accommodation, and there have
been introduced, in order to facilitate intercommunication, the Mersey Railway,
crossing under the river, and carrying annually nearly 10 millions of passengers,
and the Liverpool Overhead Railway, traversing for six miles the whole line of

Adocks, and already showing a Traffic of 7h millions of passengers per annum.

very complete waterside station connected with the landing-stage has been lately

opened by the Dock Board in connection with the London and North-Western
Railway. In addition to this, the water-supply from Rivington and Vyrnwy has
now been made one of the finest in the world.

To the hydraulic engineer there are few rivers of more interest, and present-

ing more complicated problems, than the Mersey and its neighbours, the
Dee and the Kibble. They all possess vast areas of sand covered at hio-h water

but laid dry as the tide falls, and in each case the maintenance of equilibrium

between the silting and scouring forces is of the greatest importance to the welfare

of the trading communities upon their banks. The enclosure of portions of the

areas of the respective estuaries for the purposes of the reclamation of land, or for

railway or canal embankments, may thus have far-reaching effects, diminish'ino- the

volume of the tidal flow and reducing the height of tide in the upper readies of

the rivers. Some idea of the magnitude of these considerations may be derived

from the fact that a spring tide in the Mersey brings in through the narrows

between Birkenhead and Liverpool 710 millions of cubic yards of water to form a
scouring force upon the ebb. The tidal water is heavily laden with silt, which is

deposited in the docks, and, at slack water, upon the sandbanks. The former is

removed by dredging, and amounts to some 1,100,000 cubic yards per annum
the latter is gradually fretted down into the channels and carried out to sea before

the ebb. Whilst a considerable portion of the narrows is kept scoured in some
places ris:ht down to the sandstone rock, there is a tendency, on the Liverpool side

near the landing-stage, to silt up, a difficulty counteracted, to some extent, by the

extensive sluicing arrangements introduced by Mr. George Fosbery Lys'ter the
engineer of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.                               '

     Very extensive and interesting operations have been carried on by the Board
in connection with the bar at the mouth of the river. Dredgers specially desio-ned

for the purpose have been employed for some six years, with the result lliat
15,142,600 tons of sand and other dredged matter have been removed and the
available depth of water at low-water increased from 11 to 24 feet in a channel

1,500 feet in width.

    Those who have made the transatlantic passage in former years can more

readily appreciate the very great advantage accruing from this great improvement
     Formerly vessels arriving off the port on a low tide had to wait for some hours

for the water-level to rise sufficiently to enable them to cross the bar ; the result of a

large vessel lying outside, rolling in the trough of the sea with her engines stopped,
was that not infrequently this proved to be the worst part of the voyage between

New York and Liverpool, and passengers who had escaped the malady of sea-
--888 REPORT 1896.

sickness throughout the voj-age were driven to their cabins and berths within three

or four hours of landing.

     Owing to tlie very successful dredging operations, ships of largest size can now

enter or depart from the Mersey at any state of the tide, and they are also able to

run alongside the landing-stage without the' intervention of a tender.

Such vessels as the ' Teutonic ' or ' Majestic,' of nearly 10,000 registered tonnage,

566 feet in length, 57 feet wide, and ?>1 feet deep ; or the still larger vessels, the

' Campania ' or ' Lucanisr,' of nearly 13,000 tons register, 601 feet in length, 65 feet

in width, and o8 feet in depth, can be seen, on mail days, lying alongside.
     Whilst the estuary of the Mersey presents a narrow entrance with a wide

internal estuary, the Dee, owing to extensive reclamation of land in tlie upper

reaches, has a wide external estuary leading to an emhanlved_ river of very limited
width, up which the tide rushes with great velocity laden with silt, rising in some

two hours, then, during a short time of slack water, depositing the silt, whicli is
not removed by the ebb-tide, spread over some ten hours, and therefore having

comparatively little velocity. In this case, al<o, the outer estuary_ .shows a great

tendency to silt up beyond "the reach of any but the highest spring tides.

The reclamation of the jiibble has not yet proceeded so far as to so seriously

affect  the general  conditions  of the  estuary                                               but  here,  also, there  is  a  constant
                                                                                            ;

tendency in the channels to shift, and the erosion which takes place when a high

tide and wind combine is very remarkable.

   A most important improvement was introduced in 1886, by Mr. G. F. Lyster,

when it was decided to raise the water-level in certain of the docks by pumping,
the wharves being heightened in proportion, and half- tide basins, or locks, made

use of to compensate for the difference of level.
     The area of the docks so treated in Liverpool is 78 acres, whilst at Birkenhead

the whole area of the docks on that side of the river, amounting to 160 acres, is so

raised.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ..
     The hydraulic power used in the docks is very large, the indicated horse-power

of the engines amounting to 1,673 in the case of Liverpool, and 874 in that of

Birkenhead; whilst the Hydraulic Power Comjiany are supplying .some 1,000 h.p.

to railways and private firms.

    The direct-acting hydraulic lifts of the Mersey Railway have now been at work

for ten years, and through these, at St. James's Station, no less thiui 75,000,000 to

80,000,000 of passengers have passed with regularity and safety.
     It is remarkable that, whilst Great Britain led the van in the introduction of

steam locomotion, she has lagged in the rear as regards electric and other
mechanical traction. This arose in the first instance from mistaken legislation,
which strangled electrical enterprise, which is still much hampered by the reluctance
of public authorities to permit the introduction of the necessary poles and wires

into towns.

    At the date of the latest published returns there were at work in the United

States no less than 12,133 miles of electric, in addition to 509 miles of cable,
tramway. Hardly a large village but has its installation, and vast have been the
advantages derived from these facilities. In Brooklyn one company alone owns

and works 260 miles of overhead trolley lines. With the exception of some small
tramways at Portrush, Brijihton, Blackpool, South Staffordshire, Hartlepool, &c.,

the only examples in this country of serious attempts to apply electro-motive force
to the carriage of passengers are the City and South London Railway and the
Liverpool Overhead Railway, the latter being the latest constructed, and having,

therefore, benefited by the experience gained upon the London line.

      This railway is over six miles long, a double line of the normal, or 4 ft. %\ in.

gauge, running "on an iron viaduct for the whole length of the docks; the installa-
tion is placed for convenience of coal supply about one-third of the distance from
the northern end. Particulars of this interesting work will be placed before the

Section, but suffice it to say that a train service of three minutes each way is

readily maintained, with trains carrying 112 passengers each, at an average speed

of twelve miles per hour, including stoppages at fourteen intermediate stations.

                                                                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                    880

   During the last year, as before stated, 7i million passengers were carried, the cost
   of traction per train mile being S'id.

        The Hartlepool Tramway is proving successful, overhead trollies and electric

   traction having taken the place cf a horse tramroad, which was a failure from a

   traffic point of view.

        Careful researches are being prosecuted, and experiments made, with the
   intention of reducing the excessive weight of storage batteries. If this can be

   effected, they should prove very efficient auxiliaries, especially where, in passing-
   through towns, underground conductors are dangerous, and overhead wires

   objectionable.

         In connection with electric traction, it is very important to reduce, if possible,
   the initial force required for starting from rest. Whether this will be best attained
   by tlie improvement of bearings and their better lubrication, or by the storage, for

   starting purposes, of a portion at least of the force absorbed by the brakes, remains

   to be seen, but it is a fruitful field for research and experiment.

         In the United States there is a very general and rapid displacement of the
   cable tramways by the overhead wire electric system. The latter has manj- oppo-
   jients, owing, probably, to causes which are preventable.

        Many accidents were caused by the adojjtion of very high tension currents,

   which, on the breakage of a wire, were uncontrollable, producing lamentable

   xesults.

   The overhead wires were placed in the middle of the street, causing interference

   "w'ith the passage of fire-escapes.

   The speed of the cars was excessive, resulting in many persons being run over.

   The cable system, therefore, found many advocates, but the result of experience

   is in favour of electrical traction under proper safeguards.

   The cable system can only compete with the electric system when a three-

   aniuute or quicker service is possible, or, say, when the receipts average 20/, per

   mile per day ; it is impossible to make up lost time in running, and the cars cannot

   -be ' backed.' If anything goes wrong with the cable the whole of the traffic is

   disorganised. The cost of installation is much greater than in the case of elec-

   tricity, and extensions are difficult.

   On the other hand, electricity lends itself to the demands of a growing district,

   and extensions are easily eflfected ; it satisfies more easily the growing demands

   on the part of the public for luxury in service and car appointment. It is less

   -expensive in installation, and works with greater economy. By placing the wire

   at the side of the street, and using a current of low voltage, the objections are

   greatly minimised, and the cars are much more easily controlled and manipulated.

   In cases of breakdown these are limited to the half-mile section, and do not

   completely disorganise the service. Electric cars have been worked successfully on

   gradients of 1 in 7.

   The conduit slot system can be adopted with good results, provided care is

   taken in the design of the conduit, and allowance made for ample depth and

   clearance                                                 a  width  of |-inch  is  now  proved  to  be  sufficient.  Where, however,

The rapid extension of tunnel construction for railway purposes, both in towns

and elsewhere, is one of the remarkable features of the period under review, and
has been greatly assisted by the use of shields, with and without compressed air.

This brings into considerable importance the question of mechanical ventilation.

Amongst English tunnels, ventilation by fan has been applied to those under the
Severn and the Mersey. The machinery for the latter is, probably, the most

complete and most scientific application up to the present time.
     There are five ventilating fans, two of which are 40 feet in diameter, and

12 feet wide on the blades ; two of 30 feet, and 10 feet wide ; and one quick-
running fan of IG feet in diameter, all of wliich were ably installed by Messrs.
Walker Brothers of Wigan. They are arranged, when in full work, to throw
800,000 cubic feet of air per minute, and to empty the tunnel between Woodside

and St. James's Street in eight minutes ; but, unfortunately, it is found necessary,
ibr financial reasons, not to work the machinery to its full capacity.

     The intended extension of electrical underground railways will render it neces-

sary for those still employing steam traction either to ventilate by machinery or to

substitute electro-motive force.

     Great improvements have been lately made in the details of mechanical venti-
lators, especially by the introduction of anti-vibration shutters, and the driving
by belts or ropes instead of direct from the engine. The duties now usually
required for mining purposes are about 300,000 cubic feet of air per minute with
a water-gauge of about 4 inches ; but one installation is in hand for 500,000 cubic
feet of air per minute, with a water-gauge of 6 inches. Water-gauge up to 10
inches can now be obtained with fans of 15 feet diameter only.

    An interesting installation has been made at the Pracchia Tunnel on the

Florence and Bologna Railway.
     The length of the tunnel is 1,900 metres, or about 2,060 yards ; it is for a

single line, and is on a gradient of 1 in 40. AVhen the wind was blowing in at the
lower end, the steam and smoke of an ascending train travelled concurrently with

the train, thus producing a state of afiairs almost unimaginable except to those

engaged in working the traffic.

Owing to the height of the Apennines above the tunnel, ventilating shafts are

impracticable                                                      but  it occurred to Signor  Saccardo  that, by blowing air by means
                                                                ;

of a fan into the mouth of the tunnel, through the annular space which exists

between the inside of the tunnel arch and the outside of the traffic gauge, a
sufficient current might be produced to greatly ameliorate the state of things.

     The results have been most satisfactory, the tunnel, which was formerly
almost dangerous, under certain conditions of weather, being now kept cool and

fresh, with but a small expenditure of power.

     In an age when, fortunately, more attention is paid than formerly to the well-
being of the men, the precautions necessary to be observed in driving long

tunnels, and especially in the use of compressed air, are receiving the consideration

of engineers. In the case of the intended Simplon Tunnel, which will pierce the

Alps at a point requiring a length of no less than 12^ miles, a foreign commission
( if engineei's was entrusted by the Federal Government of Switzerland with an

investigation of this amongst other questions.
     During the construction of the St. Gothard Tunnel, which is about 10 miles

in length, the difficulties encountered were, of necessity, very great; the question

of ventilation was not fully understood, nor was sanitary science sufficiently ad-
vanced to induce those engaged in the work to give it much attention. The
results were lamentable, upwards of 600 men having lost their lives, chiefly from an
insidious internal malady not then understood. But the great financial success of

this international tunnel has been so marked, as to justify the proposed construction
of a still longer tunnel under the Simplon.

     The arrangements which are to be adopted for securing the health of the
employes are admirable, and will surely not only result in reducing the death rate
to a minimum, but also tend to shorten the time necessary for the execution of the

undertaking to one-half.

The quantity of air to be forced into the workings will be twenty times greater tnan

                                                                                                         3u2

in previous works. Special arrangements are devised for reducing the temperature of

the air by many degrees, suitable houses are to be provided for the men, vsuth excel-

lent arrangements for enabling them to change their mining clothes, wet with the

water of  the tunnel, before coming in contact with  the  Alpine  cold                     every man
                                                                                        ;

will have a bath on leaving ; his wet clothes will be taken care of by a custodian,

and dried ready for his return to work ; suitable meals of wholesome food will be

provided, and he will be compelled to rest for half-an-hour on emerging from the

tunnel, in pleasant rooms furnished with books and papers. This may appear to

some as excessive care; but kind and humane treatment of men results, not only

in benefit to them, but also in substantial gain to those employing them, and the

endeavour of our own authorities, and of Parliament, to secure for our own work-

people the necessary protection for their lives and limbs in carrying out hazardous
trades and employments, is worthy of admiration.

     The great improvements in sub-aqueous tunnelling can be clearly recognised
from the fact that the Thames Tunnel cost 1,150/. per lineal yai'd, whilst the
Blackwall Tunnel, consisting of iron lined with concrete, and of 25 feet internal

diameter, has, by means of Greatheads shield and grouting machine, been driven

from shaft 1o shaft a distance of 754 yards for >i7o/. per yard.

    Tunnels have now been successfully constructed through the most difficult strata,

such as waterbearing silt, sand, and gravel, and, by the use of grouting under pres-

sure, subsidence can almost entirely be avoided, thus rendering the piercing of the
substrata of towns, underneath property without damaging it, a simple operation ;

and opening up to practical consideration many most important lines of communi-

cation hitherto considered out of the question.

    On the other hand, very little improvement has taken place in the mode of
constructing tunnels in ordinary ground, since the earlj^ days of railways. The

engineers and contractors of those days adopted systems of timbering and construc-
tion whicli have not been surpassed. The modern engineer is, however, greatly

assisted by the possibility of using Brindle bricks of great strength to resist pres-

sure, combined witli quick-setting Portland cement, by the great improvements
which have taken place in pumping machinery, and by the use of the electric light

during construction.

   A question which is forcing itself upon the somewhat unwilling attention of

our great railway companies, in consequence of the continual great increase of

the population of our cities, is the pressing necessity for a substantial increase in

the size of the terminal stations in the great centres of population.

    Many of our large terminal stations are not of sufficient capacity to be worked

properly, either with regard to the welfare of the stafl" or to the convenience of the

travelling public.

     Speak to station-masters and inspectors on duty, when the holiday season
is on, and they will tell you of the great physical strain that is produced upon
them and their subordinates, in endeavouring to cope with the difficulty.

     This, if nothing else, is a justification for the enterprise of the Manchester, Shef-

field and Lincolnshire Railway Company in providing an entirely new terminus

for London.
     It is thirty years since the last, that of St. Pancras, was added, and during that

period the population of London has inci-eased by no less than two millions.

The discussion, both in and out of Parliament, of the proposals for light rail-

ways has developed a considerable amount of interest in the question. Experi-

ence only can prove whether they will fulfil the popular expectations. If the

intended branch lines are to be of the standard gauge, with such gradients and
curves as will render them suitable for the ordinary rolling-stock, they will, in

many cases, not be constructed at such low mileage costs as to be likely to be

remunerative at rates that would attract agricultural traffic. The public roads of

tliis country (very different from the wide and level military roads of Northern

Italy and other parts of the Continent) do not usually present facilities for

their utilisation, and, once admitted, the necessity for expropriating private

jproperty, the time-honoured questions of frontage severances and interference

with amenities will force their way to the front, fencing will be necessary, and.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  893

 even if level crossings be allowed at public roads, special precautions will Lave to
 be taken.

      Much must then depend upon the regulations insisted upon by the Board of

 Trade. If, in consideration of a reduction in speed, relaxation of existing safe-

 guards are permitted, much may, no doubt, be eHected byway of feeders to existing

 main lines.

       If, on the other hand, the branches are of narrower gauge, separate equipment
 will be necessary, and transhipment at junctions will involve both expense and

 delay. It is very doubtful whether the British farmer would benefit much from
 short railways of other than standard gauge. He must keep horses for other pur-
 poses, and he will probably still prefer to utilise them for carting his produce to the
 nearest railway station of the main line, or to the market town.

      The powers granted by the Light llailwa3's Act, in the hands of the able
 Commissioners appointed under the Act, cannot, however, fail to be a public boon.

      Special Acts of Parliament will be unnecessary, facilities will be granted,
 procedure simplified, some Government aid rendered, and probably the heavy
 burden of a Parliamentary deposit will be removed.

     It would seem quite probable, that motor cars may offer one practical solution of
the problem how best to place the farms of the country in commercial touch with
the trunk railways, seaports, and market towns. They could use existing roads,

could run to the farmyard or field, and receive or deliver produce at first hand.
      Such means of locomotion were frequently proposed towards the end of the

last century, and in the early part of the present one, and il was not until the year
1840, that the victory of the railway over steam upon common roads was assured,
the tractive force required being then shown to be relatively as 1 to 7.

     The passing of the Act of 1896, superseding those of 1861 and 1865, will
undoubtedly mark the commencement of a new era in mechanical road traction.
The cars, at present constructed chiefly by German and French engineers, are
certainly of crude design, and leave much to be desired. They are ugly in appear-
ance, noisy, difficult to steer, and vibrate very much with the revolutions of their
engines, rising as they do to 400 per minute ; those driven by oil give out offensive
odours, and cannot be readily started, so that the engine runs on during short
stops. There would seem to be arising here an even more important opening for

the skill of our mechanical engineers than in the case of bicycles, in which
wonderful industry the early steps appear also to have been foreign.

     It is claimed for a motor car that it costs no more than carriage, horse, and

harness, that the repaira are about the same, and that, whilst a horse, travelling

'20 miles per day, represents for fodder a cost of 2d. per mile, a motor car of
'Jh horse-power will run the same distance at ^d. per mile.

     The highway authorities should certainly welcome the new comer, for it is
estimated that two-thirds of the present wear and tear of roads is caused by
horses, and one-third only by wheels.

     Perhaps no invention has had so widespreading an influence on the construction
of railways as the adoption of the Bessemer process for the manufacture of steel rails.
This has substituted a homogeneous crystalline structure, of great strength and
uniformity, for the iron rails of former years, built up by bundles of bars, and
therefore liable to lamination and defective welds. The price has been reduced

from the 13/. per ton, which iron rails once reached, to 3/. 15s. as a minimum for

steel. There are, however, not infrequenth^ occurring, in the experience of rail-

way companies, the cracking, and even fracture of steel rails, and the Government

has lately appointed a Board of Trade Committee for the investigation, inciden-
tally of this subject, but specially of the important question of the efiect of fatigue
upon the crystallisation, structure, and strength, of the rail. Experience proves, at
any rate, that it is of great importance to remove an ample length of crop end, as
fractures more frequently take place near the ends, aided bj' the weakening caused
by bolt holes. Frequent examniation by tapping, as in the case of tyres, seems, at
present, the most effective safeguard.

     It is open to serious question, whether the great rigidity of the permanent way

of the leading railways of this country is an advantage. Certainly the noise i»
--894 REPORT 189G.

very great, more so tlian in other countries, and this points to severe shocks, heavy

--wear and tear of rails and tyres, and especially when two heavy locomotives are
--run with the same train liability to fracture. Whilst the tendency in this

country, and in the United States, has been to gradually increase the weiglit of

rails from 40 lb. up to 1001b. per lineal yard, there are engineers who think that

to decrease the rigidity of rail and fishplate, and weight of chair, and to increase the
sleepers, so as to an-ive as nearly as possible at a continuous bearing, would result

in softness and smoothness of running.

    The average and maximum speeds now attained by express trains would appear

to have reached the limit of safety, at any rate under the existing conditions of
junctions, cross-over roads, and other interferences with the continuity of the rail.
If higher speeds are to be sought, it would seem to be necessary to have isolated
trunk lines, specially arranged in all their details, free from shai-p curve and severe
gradient, and probably worked electrically, although a speed of 100 miles per hour
is claimed to have been reached by a steam locomotive ia the United States.

     The grain trade of the port of Liverpool has assumed very large proportions,
and the system of storage in large silos has been adopted, with great advantage,
both as regards capital, outlay, and the cost of working, per ton of grain.

     The Liverpool Grain Storage Warehouses at Bootle will be open to Members
of the Association, and there can be seen the latest development of the mechanical

--unloading, storing and distribution of grain in bulk ; the capacity is large, being :

Warehouse No. 1, 56,000 tonsil

             Ur2,30,000 ,,      4,240,000 bushels,

Quay Stores  20,000  I

thus constituting this granary as one of the largest, if not the largest, in the

world.

     The question of the pressure of grain is a very difBcult one, and, in constructing
the brick silos, which are 12 feet across at the top, by nearly 80 feet in depth, large
allowance has been made both for ordinary pressure, and for possible swelling of

the grain.

     The grain is unloaded by elevators, and then transported on bands, the result
being its cooling and cleansing, as well as its storage and distribution.

     The question of the early adoption in England of the metric system is of im-

portance not only to the engineering profession, but also to the country at large.

The recommendation of the recent Royal Commission, appointed for the consideration
of the subject, was, that it should be taught at once in all schools, and that, in two
years' time, its adoption should be compulsory ; but it is much to be regretted that,
up to the present time, nothing has been done.

      The slight and temporary inconvenience of having to learn the system is of no
moment compared to the great assistance it would prove to the commercial and
trading world ; the simplification of calculations and of accounts would be hailed
with delight by all so soon as they realised the advantages. England is sufifering
greatly in her trade with the Continent for want of it.

     Our foreign customers, who have now used it for many years, will not tolerate

 the inconvenience of the endless variety of weights and measures in use in
 England, and they consequently purchase their goods, to a great extent, from
 Germany, rather than use our antiquated English sjstem. It is no exaggeration to
 say that, with their knowledge of the metric system, they regard ours as completely

 obsolete and unworkable, just in the same way as we should were we to buy our

 corn, our wine, our steel and iron, by the bin, the ephah, or the homer, or to
 compute our measurements by cubit, stadium, or parasang.

     It behoves all who desire to see England regaiii her trade to use all their

 influence in favour of the adoption of this system, as its absence is, doubtless, one
 of tbe contributory causes for the loss that has taken, and is taking, place.

     An important argument in favour of the metric system of weights and measures

 is that it is adopted all over the civilised world by physicists and chemists ; and it

 may be stated with confidence, that the present international character of these

 sciences is largely due to this.
                     TRAXSAGTIOXS OF SECTION G.                          895

        It is interesting also to notice, that tlie metric system is being gradually intro-

   duced into other branches of science. Anthropometric measurements made by the

   Committees of the British Association in this country and in Canada are invariably

   given in metres, and a comparison with measurements made in other countries can

   be at once made.

   The period of twenty-five years under review has indeed witnessed great

   advances, both in scientific knowledge and practical application. This progress has

   led to powerful yet peaceful competition between the leading nations. Both from

   among our cousins of the United States, and from our nearer neighbours of

   Europe, have we, at this Meeting, the pleasure of welcoming most respected repre-

   sentatives. But their presence, and the knowledge of the great discoveries made,

   and colossal works carried out, by them and their brother scientists and engineers,

   must make us of Great Britain face with increased earnestness the problem of

   maintaining our national position, at any rate, in the forefront of all that tends

   towards the ' utilisation of the great sources of power in Nature for the use and

   convenience of man.' Those English engineers who have been brought in contact

   with engineering thought and action in America and abroad have been impressed

   with the thoroughness of much of the work, the great power of organisation, and

   the careful reliance upon scientific principles constantly kept in view, and upon

   chemical and mechanical experiments, carried out often upon a much more

   elaborate scale than in this country. Tliis is not the place from which to discuss

   the questions of bounties and tariffs, which have i-endered possible powerful com-

   petition for the supply of machinery and railway plant from the Continent to our

   own Colonies ; but there is certainly need for advance all along the line of mechani-

   --cal science and practice, if we are to hold our own need especially to study the

   mechanical requirements of the world, ever widening and advancing, and to be

   ready to meet them, by inventive faculty first, but also by rigid adherence to

   sound principles of construction, to the use of materials and workmanship of the

   highest class, to simplicity of design and detail, and to careful adaptation of our

   productions to the special circumstances of the various markets.

   It is impossible to forecast in what direction the great advances since 1871 will

   be equalled and exceeded in the coming quarter of a century. Progress there will

   and must be, probably in increased ratio ; and some, at the end of that period, may

   be able to look back upon our gathering here in Liverpool in 1896 as dealing with

   subjects then long since left behind in the race towards perfection.

   The mechanical engineer maj' fairly hope for still greater results in the per-

   fection of machinery, the reduction of friction, the economical use of fuel, the

   substitution of oil for coal as fael in many cases, and the mechanical treatment
   of many processes still dependent upon the human hand.

        The electrical engineer (hampered as he has been in this country by unwise
   and retrograde legislation) may surely look forward to a wonderful expansion in

   the use of that mysterious force, which he has already learned so wonderfully to

   control, especially in the direction of traction.

        The civil engineer has still great channels to bridge or tunnel, vast communi-

   ties to supply with water and illuminating power, and (most probably with the

   He·assistance of the electrician) far higher speeds of locomotion to attain.  has

   before him vast and ever-increasing problems for the sanitary benefit of the world,

   and it will be for him to deal from time to time with the amazing internal traffic

   of great cities. China lies before him, Japan welcomes all advance, and Africa is

   great with opportunities for the coming engineers.
        Let us see to it, then, that our rising engineers are carefully educated and

   prepared for these responsibilities of the future, and that our scientific brethren

   may be ever ready to open up for them by their researches fresh vistas of possibili-
   ties, fresh discoveries of those wonderful powers and facts of Nature which man

   to all time will never exhaust.

        The Mechanical Section of the British Association has done good work in this
   direction in the past, and we may look forward with confidence to our younger

   brethren to maintain these traditions in the future.

                    2. The Cause of Fracture of Railway Rails.

                    By W. WoRBY Beaumont, JI.Inst.C.E.

     In this paper the author gives an explanation of the apparently anomalous
fractures of railway rails. Attention is first directed to the leading features in the
history and characteristics of fractured rails, and from these the conclusion is drawn
that the failure of any rail, however perfect, is chiefly a question of the numbei:
and weight of the trains passing over it. The effect of the rolling of the heavily
loaded wheels of engines and vehicles ^ is the gradual compression of the upper part
of the rails and the production thereby of internal stresses which are cumulative
and reach great magnitude. That which takes pliice in the material of a rail head
under the action of very heavy rolling loads at high speed, is precisely that which
is purposely brought into use every daj' in our ironworks. The eflect is, however,
obscured by the slowness of the growth and transmission of the forces which are

ultimately destructive.

    When a piece of iron or steel is subjected to pressures exceeding the limit of

elastic compression, by a rolling or hammering action, or by both these combined,
the result is spreading of the material and general change of the dimensions. This
is equally the case with a plate pane hammered on one side or rolled on one pide
while resting on a flat surface, or with a rivet when hammered over. In all these
cases and many others, the hammering or rolling work done upon the surfaces
tends to compress the material beneath it, but being nearly incompressible and
unchangeable in density, the material flows, and cliange of form results.

      Generally the material thus changed in form suffers permanently no greater
stresses than those within its elastic limit of compression or extension. AVhen,
however, the material is not free to flow or to change its form in the directions
in which the stresses set up would act, the effect of continued work done on tho
surface is the growth of compressive stress exceeding elastic resistance.

      In the case of railway rails the freedom for the flow of the material is very

limited, especially when considered with reference to the rolling and hammering
media and the surface contact between rails and wheels. Hardening of the surface
takes place and destructive compression of the surface material is set up. If the

 material be cast iron, the destructive compression causes crumbling of the superficial
parts and the consequent relief of the material immediately below it from stress

beyond that of ela.stic compression ; but when the material is that of steel rails,

 the stress accumulates, the upper part near the surface being under intense

 compression, dift'erenliating from a maximum at the surface.

      This compression gives rise to molecular stresses analogous to those which,
 on the compression side or inner curve of a bar bent on itself, originate traverse
 flaws on that side.

      This condition of compression exists along the whole length of a rail, so that

 when its magnitude is sufficient to originate crumbling or minute flaws, any

 iniusual impact stress, or a stress in the direction opposite to that brought about

 by the usual rolling load, the rail may break into two or into numerous pieces.

 Stresses originating in the same manner explain the fracture of railway tyres as
 described fully by the author in the ' Proceedings of the Institution of Civil

 Engineers,' 187C, vol. xlvii.

      ' The static pressure per square inch of surface contact between wheel and rail
with locomotive weights now common is considerably more than iJO tons, and the
pressure under heavily balance-weighted locomotive wheels at high speed is much
 greater than this.

            4. Notes on Electric Cranes. By E, W. Anderson.

     After some introductory remarks, the author states that his object is to give
an account of the experience gained daring the last eight years at the Erith Iron
Works, where two electric travelling cranes have been in constant use for about that

period.

    No actual experiments are, however, given, as a paper with all such informa-
tion is to be read by Mr. Eavenshaw at the Institution of Civil Engineers, and it

is not considered advisable to forestall this in any way.

   A brief description of a 20-ton crane in the foundry is given, to which electricity

was applied as a motive power early in 1888, and of which a full account was

written in a paper read before the British Association in the same vear by Dr. W.

Anderson, C.B., F.E.S.
     This crane is driven by one single motor which actuates all the difterent

motions, and the paper describes some of the difficulties at first experienced with

it, and the way in which they were overcome.

   A self-contained steam crane was shortly afterwards placed in the foundry of

the same size, and enabled a comparison to be made of the practical advantages of
each, and of the amount of repairs required by them, resulting in the practical
proof of the superiority of the electric one, by the fact that early prejudice against
it had been quite overcome, and that now it was greatly preferred to the other.

     Not only are the repairs required less, but in several other ways the electric
·crane is both more convenient and less costly.

     Attention is called to the first motion gearing of the electric crane, which
though satisfactory was very noisy, and the means whereby it was much improved
are mentioned, though from the necessities of the particular circumstances it can-
not be made quite as noiseless as it should be.

   A description then follows of a second crane in the turnery to which electricity

was applied shortly after the first was started, but which had to be dealt with in
a different manner, namely, by applying a separate motor for each motion, the first
motion gear consisting of short belts with jockey pulleys. The motions were
therefore controlled by three reversing switches, and a brake for lowering.

     The method of collecting the current was different from that used in the foundry,
and is fully described.

      This crane has also proved very successful, and has given very little trouble.

The belt reduction gear is quite noiseless.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  899

    The author sums up the experience with these cranes by stating that in his

opinion electricity applied to this purpose has proved itself to be remarkably
efficient, even in the somewhat trying atmosphere of a foundry.

     Various practical points are then discussed relating to efficiency, cost, and

general convenience.

   A comparison is made of the relative merits of the single motor system as used

in the foundry, and the three-motor arrangement as in the turnery.
      Several methods of reducing the comparatively high speed of the motor to the

slow speed of the gearing shafts, as required in cranes and similar machines, are
described and commented upon.

     The paper concludes with a brief comparison of the merits of hydraulic and
electric transmission as applied to cranes, pointing out that the adaptability of one
or the other must depend entirely on the circumstances of the case, but at the
same time showing that for travelling cranes the difficulty of conveying the pres-

sure-water to the crane practically precludes its adoption, while in this respect

electricity stands foremost, especially where there is a long travel.

         By William George Walker, 2I.Inst.M.E., A.M.Inst.C.E.

     Great difference exists between the quality of the illumination required for
the various streets of a large town. Arc lamps are undoubtedly the right thing
for busy streets, but would prove an extravagant illumination for ordinary bye-
etreets or roads of country towns.

     It may roughly be taken that the quality of the illumination necessary is of

--two kinds firstly, where a flood of light is necessary on account of the nature of

the traffic ; secondly, where the light is necessary for the demarcation of the

roads. At present very little street lighting by glow lamps has been carried out

in this coimtry. It has, however, been tried with success on a fairly large scale

in America and on the Continent. There are many objections to taking the

current off the ordinary low pressure mains that serve for house lighting. Esti-
mates show that the parallel system is generally impracticable on account of the
great cost of the copper mains required for the proper distribution of small incan-
descent lamps in streets.

     The parallel system becomes practical in congested districts, and where natural
water power can be obtained. It has been felt that a way out of the adoption of
a ' series system ' of distribution. The main difficulty against this system is that
the failure of a lamp filament is liable to put out all the lamps on the circuit.

     In the town of Temesvar in Hungary, nearly ten years ago, 750 16-candle-power
lamps on the multiple series system were installed, with satisfactory results, the

wires being overhead.

     The series system has been installed in the parishes of Kingswood and
Keynsham, near Bristol, with considerable success during the four and a half years
which it has been at work.

     At Kingswood, about seven miles of roads are lighted by circuits of 2, 2^ and
3 miles respectively from the central station. The lamps are spaced at 60 yards

apart, and are elevated at from 14 to 16 feet from the level of the road on
wooden poles, which also carry the overhead wires.

     There are 150 street lamps of candle power varying from 100 to 25. The

indicated horse-power of the engine at full load is 32.

     The revenue from street lighting at 2hd. per vuiit is 650/. per annum, leaving a
clear profit of 100/., after allowing for depreciation and all expenses. Lighting
hours, 4,250 per annum. Total cost of plant, about 3,500/. The chief feature
of this installation is the automatic cut out, so that the failure of one lamp

does not affect the lamps iu series with it. Each circuit is divided into two

branches, taking equal amounts of current. Each lamp has in series with it an

Aelectro-magnet.  resistance is placed as a shunt to the lamp. The normal

current will not lift the armature of the electro-magnet, hut when a lamp hreaks,

double the current passes through the allied lamp, and lifts the armature, com-

pleting the circuit througli the shunt, the resistance of which is equal to the

lamp.

   A series system with overhead wires is suitable for scattered districts, and is

as cheap as gas.

    Now that it is possible to obtain lamps suitable for working at 250 volts, and

when used in conjunction with a three-wire system, it may be worth while to pay

for the extra copper.

    An alternating system might be considered with a small transformer for each

lamp, reducing the voltage in the primary mains from, say, 2,000 to 250 in the

secondary wire, on which the glow lamp would be placed.

  The following Papers were read :

--1. Armour and Heavy Ordnance Recent Developments and Standards.

       By Captain W. H. Jaques, of the United States of America.

    When I picked up the last issue of Brassey's ' Naval Annual ' (1896), and upou

the title-page read

'No system of conduct; however correct in principle, can protect Neutral

APowers from injury from any party.  defenceless position and a distinguished

love of peace are the surest invitations to war." Thomas Jeffeeson.

it occurred to me how little our legislators are influenced by the words of the

eminent statesman which have been selected by the editor of a British Annual of

the record of the naval events of the year as a warning to Great Britain, the first
naval power of the world, that its preparations for defence must be liberal and

continuous.

     The situation and policy of the United States could not be more accurately de-

Ascribed than by these v/ovAaoi SeSKVSon,^ defenceless 2)osition and a distiiujuished

love of peace, ^ yet little heed is given to his warning that these conditions ' are the

surest invitations to tear.'

     In fact our engineers and manufacturers are the only ones who have awakened

to the situation, and this awakening will no doubt be attributed to the hope of
pecuniary gain. They have, however, no matter whatever the incentive, attained

the highest standards in the production of armour, heavy ordnance, and projectiles.

All we need in the United States are adequate budgets and well-planned ship-
building programmes. That we are gradually reaching out in the right direction
is shown by the following table of estimates for ls'JG-7, taken from Brassev's

The progress in armour-making                        myreferred to in  last       public  pamphlet  ( 1894)

lias been continuous, and the United States (The Carnegie Steel Co., Ltd.) and

Germany (Krupp) have produced armour fully 15% it' not 20% better than

the best plain steel Harveyed armour that Great Britain has placel upon her

battleships ; although one i.s handicapped in making thorough comparison so long

as England continues to determine the value of her battleship armour by firino-

()-inch soft Iloltzer shells against G-inch plates at velocities helow 2,000 ft. sec.

    In making a comparison of the tests I have cited, we must not lose sight of the
fact that the German and French plates were experimental, and made to secure

the greatest resistance possibhi, whereas those of the United States were service

plates representing hundreds of tons of armour from which the inspectors had

.selected what they considered were the poorest of the lot.

   A summary of recent advances will include the cheapening and more extensive

use of nickel; the substitution of the hydraulic forging-press for hammers and

rolls                     better  means of removing  scale ;  simplification  of  the  methods, and  more
                       ;

uniform results of supercarburisation ; utilisation of the valuable sub-forging pro-

cess (now required for all United States armour) ; improved facilities for harden-

ing, and improvements in the machines and tools for shaping and finishing.

While in the United States the increased resistance of armour has determined

the authorities to retain the higher calibres of heavy ordnance, the Navy Depart-

ment having ordered 13-inch B.L. rifles for battleships, and the War Department

having commenced a type gun of 16-inch calibre (both adhering to the forged-

hooped type), Great Britain still keeps the 12-inch as her limit, and continues the

radical departure to wire construction made by Dr. Anderson when he became

Director-General, and so successfully carried out by him.

    France adheres to types containing too many parts, and Germany is satisfied to
possess a large number of comparatively low ballistic power.

    No matter which type, hooped or wire, is adhered to, improved armour and

projectiles must be met by greater energies, which involve higher pressures,

shorter guns (for utility), and stronger material. That this last is to he obtained

in the United States is evident from the following requisites in a 8-inch test piece

for nickel steel tubes for cannon of 8-inch calibre and over :

                          Tensile Strength                    90,000 lb. per sq. in.
                          Elastic Limit
                          Elongation                          56,000 ,, ,, ,, ,,

     Equally favourahle progress has been made with projectiles, but as yet very
few truly competitive results are at hand. The uncertainty of their relative
value still causes a very large unknown quantity in the valuation of armour

com parisons.
     In conclusion we may count, at least in the United States, as commercial com-

modities, armour having a resistance 10% better than the best of last year; heavy

ordnance giving service velocities of 200 ft. sec. higher, and armour-piercing pro-
jectiles, that to he accepted must perforate a thickness of nickel-steel carburised

armour equal to their calibre. Trrdy au excellent record

             2. A new Spherical Balanced Valve for all Pressures.
                By James Casey, Considting Marine Engineer.

     In this paper the author deals with the avoidable loss of life and damage to
property caused thi-ough explosions of defective valves, whether from steam, water,
or other fluid, where extreme pressures were used. Having described the valves
generally in use, he points out that in many cases water that had passed into the
valve-box and steam-pipes from the boilers had caused danger and even fatal
results, often attributed to defective steam-pipes, whereas both valve-box and
                                          --

pipes were charged with water from the steam leaking and passing into the main

steam-pipe and getting condensed into water. No means were afforded under the

present valve system of draining this water, and hence it happened that the

moment the stop -valves were opened on the hollers full to the engines a hammer-
ing took place, the explosion immediately following. From the design of these
valves he did not see how it was possible for a satisfactory drainage to be applied

that could he always available and keep the steam-pipes free of water and of the

danger to which he referred.
     The importance of having reliable valves under extreme pressure, whether for

steam, water, or other iluid. could not be overestimated. Having regard to this,
he had designed a valve of globe form which, he might say with perfect confidence,
was balanced under all or any pressures. The valve formed a complete sphere,
with openings in the same at right angles to each other, with spindle cast on,
workino- in a fixed and adjustable seating, and so arranged that the pressures were
balanced or equalised, and' friction was reduced to a minimum. This sphere was
fitted into a valve-box, sometimes made in two parts for convenience in adjusting
the sphere and its seatings, such being adopted to allow for contraction and
expansion under pressure. Suitable openings were formed in the valve-box corre-
sponding with those in the globe, so that when the globe was turned by its spindle
to the required position the same mightbe turned off' or on. 'J'he openings in the
valve-box and in the sphere respectively were arranged to correspond with the
full supply of steam, water, or other fluid. The globe or Ijall was perforated
with a small passage corresponding to a similar passage in the valve casing, and
when opposite to each other any condensed steam or water escaped from the steam-

pipes or valves either to the condenser or ran to waste, thereby effectually clearing
the pipe of water and preventing any chance of explosion.

     As showing some of the defects arising from the existing system in connection

with boilers, steam-pipes, and heating-apparatus in mills, on board ship, in public
buildings and places of business, the author gave particulars derived from Board
of Trade reports of official inquiries under Act of Parliament. These clearly

pointed to the necessity of a new departure in the valve system if the present
destruction of life and property was to be obviated.

     For hydraulic purposes the author claims that with the new valve no grit or

sandy matter could get between the valve and seatings, for the simple reason that

Ait worked in and on the seatings, and no foreign matter could be introduced.

valve on this principle has now been at work close upon eighteen months, and it
had been found upon examination that it was as good now as on the first day it was

put in place, and had not cost a penny for repairs or even adjustment, although in
daily work at a pressure of 750 lb. per square inch. In the use of higher pres-
sures the limit of its working was the cohesive strength of the material of which
it mio-ht be constructed, and being balanced it was manipulated bv a small lever
which a boy could work. The system which the author had advocated possessed
 equal advantages in connection with fire hydrants and water supply generally
 owing to its simplicity and the ease with which it could be worked. Briefly
 what the author claimed was that by the adoption of his Aalve system the follow-
 ing, amongst other advantages, would be attained :

      1. The substitution of a perfectly balanced spherical valve under all pressure
 for one on the old principle of lifting, which is liable to get out of order or to
 cause explosion, consequent on faulty construction and the absence of proper
 means of draining steam-pipes and other connections therewith.

      2. The valve can be worked easily and instantaneously, and is not affected

 where dirty or gritty water is used.
      3. The valve can be adopted for steam, hydraulic, gas, mining, and all other

 purposes for which valves are in daily use, and made of cast iron or gun metal.
      4. The valve drains itself and the connections of boilers, &c., of all water

 created by condensation of steam, thereby preventing dangerous hammering in the

 pipes and obviating, under certain conditions, the bursting or freezing of pipes

 and concomitant dangers.

                 3. Engineering Laboratory Apparatus.

           By Professor H. S. Hele-Shaav, M.Inst.C.E.

    At the Liverpool Meeting of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1891
an account was given of the chief appliances in the Walker Engineering Labora-

tories at Liverpool.

   A description of the Triple-Expausion steam engine and boiler, and the alterna-

tive centre 100 ton testing Machine will be found illustrated in the Proceedings of
the Institution of Mechanical Engineers for 1891.

     The first intention of the author on the present occasion was to give a descrip-
tion of certain appliances which are of a novel character and which were to be
shown in operation together with other experimental arrangements at the Walker

Engineering Laboratories after the reading of the paper.
     These appliances might be conveniently' arranged under the three following

heads, which constituted in fact the three divisions of Laboratory teaching, viz. :

     1. The steam engine.

      2. Hydraulics.
     3. Testing the strength and properties of materials.

The apparatus to be mentioned imder tlio first head were as follows :

     1. Hydraulic brake and integrator.                                courses  of
     2. Spring dynamometer.
     3. Arrangement for drawing crank-effort diagrams.
   [ 4. Arrangement in connection with steam-engine indicators.
     5. General arrangements in connection with the experimental

instruction.

Under the head of Hydraulics :
1. Hydraulic tank, valve-boxes and sump.

Under the third head :

1 An extensometer of novel design.

2. Arrangement for testing the torsion of shafts.

A3. convenient gauge in connection with crushing and bending experiments.

When, however, the author came to actually prepare the paper and diagrams,

he found that it would be impossible to deal in a satisfactory manner with all
these subjects, many of which were entirely new, all possessing novel features,

representing the hitherto unpublished work of some years. He therefore limited

himself to the experimental steam engine and the hydraulic tank, merely indicating

by means of diagrams various matters without attempting to describe them fuUy,

which might be seen in operation at the laboratories, where actual trials would be

conducted by the students in the same way as during the work of the college

classes.'                                                              !<,. ^<

water circulated, a weight of 1 ,500 lb. being required to take tlie power of the

engine.

This brake never worked satisfactorily, and thougli every expedient was tried,

it was found impossible to conduct a trial with any regularity beyond 30 indicated

iiorse-power. Moreover, owing to the flywheel being overhung, and a weight

hauo-ing upon it, during a long trial, the bearing nearest the wheel almost

invariably became heated. Beyond thi.s, it was found th.it for practical pur-
Aposes a 3-ton wheel was unnecessarily large for any trials.
                                                              brake, of which

a descriptive diagram was shown, was therefore designed, the weight of the fly-

-wheel being about 15 cwt., instead of 3 tons, and the framing being so arranged

that the load was taken oft' the bearing. This brake at once removed the difficulty

of heating, and a regular series of trials were made up to about 60 horse-power,

which during one session served quite satisfactorilj- for the work of the students.

iBeyond this, however, it was impossible to get regular runnings with the brake.

The loads were taken by a hemp cable, five coils of which passed round the wheel,

which is in the form of a broad pulley, and acted by taking advantage of the

power of coil friction. To get steady runnings it was found necessary to keep

the rope wet, a stream of water flowing upon it.

It had been originally intended to have the form of Froude hydraulic brake, as

modified by Professor Osborne lleynolds, and it became evident that nothing but a

hydraulic brake would solve the problem of taking up continuously 150 horse-

power. The question of cost had prevented this form of brake from being obtained

orioinally from Messrs. Mather and Piatt, and the same reason led to a modified design

of the hydraulic brake, in which the cliief cause of expense in the Reynolds type

' was avoided, viz. by doing away with the considerable amount of coring for air and

·water passages in the castings, and also iu constructing the main part in cast iron

instead of gun-metal, and further, in having it single acting. For this, and other

apparatus, funds Avere provided through the kindness of Mr. Charles W. Jones (of

Messrs. Lamport and Holt) and Mr. R. R. Heap.

The author then proceeded to explain by means of models the action of the

brake, and the features which were peculiar in the new brake, which were as

(follows :

(1) The vortex is artificially produced.
(2) The brake is single acting.
(3) The pressure is downwards, so as to take the weight of the brake ofi^; in

           fact, practically not to take oft" the weight of the brake only, but also of

            the flywheel.

(4) Autographic recording and registering arrangements are employed.
(5) Special arrangements are adopted by which automatic action is secured.

     These various points were considered in detail and described by means of draw-
ings, but it was pointed out that as far as the actual work of the trials for the

students were concerned, none of the refinements mentioned were necessary. An

extremely simple form of brake was quite sufficient to maintain the engine running
j)erfectly steady under the highest steam pressures

     The various features in which the engine itself has been improved were then
mentioned, and may be summarised as follows :

A(1) series of drain tanks, so as to measure the water condensed in the steam

             jackets.

A(2) separate tank has been provided, into which the water from these drain

            tanks is thereby checked.

A(3) new special tank for the exact calibration of feed-water supply has been

          provided, which works in connection with the injector by which the

              Doiler is supplied.

A((4) special arrangement has been devised by which the indicator diagrams

           can be conveniently and rapidly taken by students.

'(5) A avstera of checkin? and graduating the indicator springs, which has been

           found most valuable in operation by means of a duplex standard steam

            gauge.

    (6) An arrangement was shown in operation for obtaining- the diagrams of

               ci'ank effort, by means of a special ajiparatus which is done on smoked
                 glass. These can either be printed off, or used direct in the lantern for
                illustration upon the screen.

    The dynamometer coupling was then described and illustrated, after which a
diagram giving a complete table of the results of several trials of the experimental
engine was shown, and copies were distributed amongst members of the Section,'
The varioiis conditions of the trials were as follows:

                        Triple unjacketed condensing.
                        Triple jacketed condensing.

     These tables showed at a glance the method adopted for tabulating the results
of the trials which had been carried out by the senior lecturer, Mr. Dunkerley.

    The hydraulic tank and sump was next alluded to, and the new form of valves

for rapidly operating with the jet under pressure was mentioned ; a brief descrip-
tion of the other laboratory apparatus illustrated on the diagrams then concluded

the paper.

The President delivered the following Address :

' The Eastern Question ' in Anthropology.

Tbavbllees have ceased to seek for the ' Terrestrial Paradise,' but, in a broader

sense, the area in which lay the cradle of civilised mankind is becoming generally

recognised. The plateaux of Central Asia have receded from our view. Anthropo-
logical researches may be said to have established the fact that the White Race, in

the widest acceptation of the term, including, that is, the darker-complexioned

section of the South and West, is the true product of the region in which the

earliest historic records find it concentrated. Its ' Area of Characterisation ' is

conterminous, in fact, with certain vast physical barriers due to the distribution of

sea and land in the latest geological period. The continent in which it rose, shut in

between the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, between the Libyan Desert, and

what is now Sahara, and an icier Baltic stretching its vast arms to the Ponto-

Caspian basin, embraced, together with a part of anterior Asia, the greater part of

--Europe, and the whole of Northern Africa. The Mediterranean itself divided

into smaller separate basins, with land bridges at the Straits of Gibraltar, and

--from Sicily and Malta to Tunis did not seriously break the continuity of the

whole. The English Channel, as we know, did not e.xist, and the old sea-coast of

what are now the British Islands, stretching far to the west, is, as Professor

Boyd Dawkins has shown, approximately represented by the hundred-fathom line.

To this great continent Dr. Brinton, who has so ably illustrated the predominant

part played by it in isolating the white from the African black and the yellow

races of mankind, has proposed to give the useful and appropriate name of

* Eurafrica.' In ' Eurafrica,' in its widest sense, we find the birthplace of the

highest civilisations that the world has yet produced, and the mother country of

its dominant peoples.

It is true that later geological changes have made this continental division no

longer applicable. The vast land area has been opened to the east, as if to invite

the Mongolian nomads of the Steppes and Tundras to mingle with the European

population ; the Mediterranean bridges, on the other hand, have been swept away.

Asia has advanced, Africa has receded. Yet the old underlying connexion of the

peoples to the north and south of the Mediterranean basin seems never to have

been entirely broken. Their inter-relations affect many of the most interesting

phenomena of archaeology and ancient history, and the old geographical unity of

' Eurafrica ' was throughout a great extent of its area revived in the great political

system which still forms the basis of civilised society, the Roman Empire. The

AMediterranean was a Roman lake.  sinp^le fact brings home to us the extent to
                                                                                                          --

which the earlier continuity of Europe and North Africa asserted itself in the

imperial economy. At one time, what is now Morocco and what is now

Northumherland, witli all that lay between them on both sides of the Pyrenees,

found their administrative centre on the Mosel.

    It is not for me to dwell on the many important questions affecting the physio-

logical sides of ethnography that are bound up with these old geographical relations.

I will, however, at least call attention to the interesting, and in many ways
original, theory put forward by Professor Sergi in his recent work on the ' Mediter-

ranean Race.'

     Professor Sergi is not content with the ordinary use of the term * White Race.'

He distinguishes a distinct ' brown ' or ' brunette ' branch, whose swarthier com-

plexion, however, and dark hair bear no negroid affinities, and are not due to any
intermixture on that side. This race, with dolichocephalic skulls, amongst which

certain clearly defined types constantly repeat themselves, he traces throughout
the Mediterranean basin, from Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor, through a large part

of Southern Europe, including Greece, Italy, and the Iberic peninsula, to the

British islands. It is distributed along the whole of North Africa, and, according
to the theory propounded, finds its original centre of diffusion somewhere in the

parts of Somaliland.

    It may be said at once that this grouping together into a consistent system of

--ethnic factors spread over this vast yet inter-related area the heart of ' Eurafrica'

presents many attractive aspects. The ancient Greek might not have accepted
kinship even with ' the blameless Ethiopian,' but those of us who may happen
to combine a British origin with a Mediterranean complexion may derive a certain
ancestral pride from remote consanguinity with Pharaoh. They may even be

willing to admit that ' the Ethiopian ' in the course of his migrations has done

much to ' change his skin.'
    In part, at least, the new theory is little more than a re-statement of an ethno-

graphic grouping that commands a general consensus of opinion. From Thurnam's

time onwards we have been accustomed to regard the dolichocephalic type found in

the early Long Barrows, and what seem to have been the later survivals of the

same stock in our islands, as fitting on to the Iberian element in South-western

Europe. The extensive new materials accumulated by Dr. Garson have only served
to corroborate these views, while further researches have shown that the character-
istic features of the skeletons found in the Ligurian caves, at Cro Magnon and
«lsewhere in France, are common to those of a large part of Italy, Sicily, and
Sardinia, and extend not only to the Iberic group, but to the Guanche interments

of the Canary Islands.

The newly correlated data unquestionably extend the field of comparison ; but

the theories as to the original home of this ' Mediterranean race ' and the course
of its diffusion may be thought to be still somewhat lacking in documentary
evidence. They remind us rather too closely of the old ' Aryan ' hypothesis, in

which we were almost instructed as to the halting places of the different detach-
ments as they passed on their way from their Central Asian cradle to rearrange

themselves with military precision, and exactly in the order of their relationship,

.in their distant European homes. The existing geological conditions are made

the basis of this migratory expansion from  Ethiopia to  Ireland                                parallel  streams
                                                                                             ;

move through North Africa and from Anatolia to Southern Europe. One cardinal

fact has certainly not received attention, and that is, that the existing evidence of
this Mediterranean type dates much further back on European soil than even in

ancient Egj'pt.

      Professor Sergi himself has recognised the extraordinary continuity of the

cranial type of the Ligurian caves among the modem population of that coast.

     But this continuity involves an extreme antiquity for the settlement of the
* Mediterranean Race ' in North-western Italy and Southern France. The cave
interments, such as those of the Finalese, carry back the type well into Neolithic
times. But the skeletons of the Baouss6 Rouss6 caves, between Mentone and
Ventimiglia, which reproduce the same characteristic forms, take us back far
behind any stage of culture to which the name of Neolithic can be properly applied.

                                                                                                3N2
--908 REroRT 1896.

     The importance of ttis series of interments is so uiiique, and the fulness of the
evidence so far surpasses any other records immediately associated with the earliest
remains of man, that even in this brief survey they seem to demand more than a

passing notice.

     So much, at least, must be admitted on all hands : an earlier stage of culture is
exhibited in these deposits than that -which has hitherto been rep:arded as the mini-

mum equipment of tlie men of the later Stone Ape. The complete absence of

--pottery, of polished implements, of domesticated animals all the more strikinj:^

from the absolute cojitrast presented )jy the rich Neolithic cave burials a little

further up the same coast --how is it to be explained? The lon^ flint knives, tlie

bone and shell ornaments, might, indeed, find partial parallels among Neolithic
remains ; but does not, after all, the balance of comparison incline to that more

ancient group belonging to the * Reindeer Period' in the South of France, as illus-
rated by the caves of La Madeleine, IjCS Eyzies and Solutre ?

    It is true that, in an account of the interments found in 189S in the Barma
Grande Cave, given by me to the Anthropological Institute, I was myself so pre-
possessed by the still dominant doctrine that the usage of burial was unknown to
Palreolithic man, and so overpowered by the vision of tlie yawning hiatus between

him and his Neolithic successor, that I failed to realise the full import of the
evidence. On that occasion I took refuge in the suggestion that we had here to

deal with an earlier Neolithic stratum than any hitlierto recorded. 'Neolithic/

that is, without the Neolithic.
     But the accumulation of fresh data, and especially the critical observations of

M. d'Acy and Professor Issel, have convinced me that this intermediate position is
untenable. From the great depth below the original surface, of what in all cases
seem to have been homogeneous quaternary deposits, at which the human remains

were found, it is necessary to suppose, if the interments took place at a later

period, that pits in many cases from 30 to 40 feet deep must have been excavated in
the cave earth. But nothing of the kind has been detected, nor any intrusion of
extraneous materials. On the other hand, the gnawed or defective condition of the

extremities in several cases points clearly to superficial and imperfect interment of
the body; and in one case parts of tlie same core from which flints found with the
skeleton had been chipped were found some metres distant on the same floor level.
Are we, then, to imagine that another pit was expressly dug to bury these ?

     In the case of a more recently discovered and as yet unpublished interment, at
the excavation of which I was so fortunate as to assist, the superficial character of
the deposit struck the eye. The skeleton, with flint knife and ochre near, decked
out with the usual shell and deer's tooth ornaments, lay as if in the attitude of
.sleep, somewhat on the left side. The middle of the body was covered with a large
flat stone, with two smaller ones lying by it, while another large stone was laid
over the feet. The left arm was bent under the head as if to pillow it, but the
extremities of the right arm and the toes were suggestively deficient : the surface
covering of big stones had not sufficiently protected them. The stones themselves
 seem in turn to have served as a kind of heartli, for a stratum of charred and
 burned bones about 45 cm. thick lay about them.

      Is it reasonable to suppose that a deposit of this kind took place at the bottom
 of a pit over 20 feet deep, left open an indefinite time for the convenience of
 roasting venison at the bottom ?

    A rational survey of the evidence in this as in the other cases leads to the conclu-

--sion that we have to deal with surface burial, or, if that word seems too strong, with

 simple ' seposition ' the imperfect covering with handy stones of the dead bodies
 as they lay in the attitude of sleep on the then floor of the cavern. In other
words, they are in situ in a late quaternary deposit, for which Professor Issel has
proposed tlie name of ' Meiolithic'

     But if this conclusion is to hold good, we have here on the northern coast of

the Mediterranean evidence of the existence of a late Palajolithic race, the essential
features of which, in the opinion of most competent osteological inquirers, reappear
in the Neolithic skeletons of the same Ligurian coast, and still remain characteristic
if the historical Ligurian type. In other words, the ' Mediterranean Race ' finds
                                                                                                                       ;'

its first record in tbe "West ; and its diffusion, so far from Iiaving necessarily

followed the lines of later geographical divisions, may well have begun at a time

·when the land bridges of ' Eurafrica' were still unbroken.

There is nothing, indeed, in all this to exclude the hypothesis that the original

expansion took place from the East African side. That the earliest homes of

primseval man lay in a warm region can hardly be doubted, and the abundant

discovery by Mr. Seton Ivarr in Somaliland of Paleolithic implements reproducing

many of the most characteristic forms of those of the grottoes of the Dordoi^ne
affords a new link of connexion between the Red Sea and the Atlantic littoral.

     AVhen we recall the spontaneous artistic qualities of the ancient race which has

left its records in the carvings on bone and ivory in the caves of the ' Reindeer

Period,' this evidence of at least partial continuity on the northern shores of the

Mediterranean suggests speculations of the deepest interest. Overlaid with new

elements, swamped in the dull, though materially higher, Neolithic civilisation,
may not the old aesthetic faculties wbich made Europe the earliest-known home of
anything that can be called humau art, as opposed to mere tools and mechanical

contrivances, have finally emancipated themselves once more in the Southern

regions, where the old stock most survived ? In the extraordinary manifestations

of artistic genius to which, at widely remote periods, and under the most diverse

political conditions, the later populations of Greece and Italy have given birth, may
we not be allowed to trace tlie re-emergence, as it were, after long underground

meanderings, of streams whose upper waters had seen the daylight of that earlier

world ?

But the vast gulf of time beyond which it is necessary to carry back our gaze

in order to establish such connexions will hardly permit us to arrive at more

than vague probabilities. The practical problems that concern the later culture

of Europe from Neolithic times onwards connect themselves rather with its relation

to that of the older civilisations on the southern and eastern Mediterranean shores.

Anthropology, too, has its ' Eternal Eastern Question.' Till within quite

recent years, the glamour of tbe Orient pervaded all inquiries as to the genesis
«f European civilisation. The Biblical training of the northern nations prepared

tlie ground. The imperfect realisation of the antiquity of European arts; on the

other hand, the imposing  chronology of  Egypt  and  Babylonia                                           the  abiding  force
                                                                                                      ;

of classical tradition, which found in the Phoenician a deia e.v viackmd for

exotic importations; finally, the 'Aryan Hypothesis,' which brought in the
dominant European races as immigrant wanderers from Central Asia, with a

--ready-made stock of culture in their wallets these and other causes combined to

create an exaggerated estimate of the part played by the East as the illuminator of

the benighted West.

     More recent investigations have resulted in a naturaj reaction. The primitive
'Aryan' can be no longer invoked as a kind of patriarchal missionary of Central
Asian culture. From d'llalloy and Latham onwards to Penka and Schrader an

array of eminent names has assigned to him an European origin. The means by

·which a kindred tongue diffused itself among the most heterogeneous ethnic

factors still remain obscure; but the stricter application of phonetic laws and

the increased detection of loan-words has cut down the original ' Aryan ' stock of

culture to very narrow limits, and entirely stripped the members of this linguistic

family of any trace of a common Pantheon.

    Whatever the character of the original -'Aryan' stage, -we may be very sure

that it lies far back in the mists of the European Stone Age. ~ The supposed
common names for metals prove to be either a vanishing quantity or strikingly
irrelevant. It may be interesting to learn on unimpeachable authority that the
Celtic words for ' gold ' are due to comparatively recent borrowing from the Latin

but nothing' is more certain than that gold was one of the earliest metals known

to the Celtic races, its knowledge going back to the limits of the pure Stone Age.
"We are told that the Latin ' ensis,' ' a sword,' is identical with the Sanskrit ' asi
and Iranian 'ahi,' but the gradual evolution of the sword from the dagger, only
completed at a late period of the Bronze Age, is a commonplace of prehistoric

archaeology. If ' ensis/ then, in historical times an iron sword, originally meant a
910 REPORT-- 1896.

bronze dagger, may not the bronze dagger in its turn resolve itself into a flint

knife?

The truth is that the attempts to father on a common Aryan stock the

beginnings of metallurgy argue an astonishing inability to realise the vast

antiquity of languages and their groups. Yet we knove that, as far back as we

have any written records, the leading branches of the Aryan family of speech

stood almost as far apart as they do to-day, and the example of the Egyptian and

Semitic groups, which Maspero and others consider to have been originally con-
nected, leads to still more striking results. From the earliest Egyptian stela to

the latest Coptic liturgy we find the main outlines of what is substantially the

same language preserved for a period of some six thousand years. The Semitic

languages in their characteristic shape show a continuous history almost as ex-

tensive. For the date of the diverging point of the two groups we must have

recourse to a chronology more familiar to the geologist than the antiquary.

As importer of exotic arts into primitive Europe the Phoenician has met the

fate of the immigrants from the Central Asian ' Arya.' The days are gone past

when it could be seriously maintained that the Phoenician merchant landed on the

Acoast of Cornwall, or built the dolmens of the North and West.  truer view of

primitive trade as passing on by inter-tribal barter has superseded the idea of a

direct commerce betv/een remote localities. The science of prehistoric archseologj^

following the lead of the Scandinavian School, has established the existence in

every province of local centres of early metallurgy, and it is no longer believed that

the implements and utensils of the European Bronze Age were imported wholesale

by Semites or ' Etruscans.'

It is, however, the less necessary for me to trace in detail the course of this re-

action against the exaggerated claims of Eastern influence that the case for the

independent po.sition of primitive Europe has been recently summed up with fresh

arguments, and in his usual brilliant and incisive style, by M. Salomon Reinach, in
his ' Mirage Orientale.' For many ancient prejudices as to the early relations of
East and West it is the trumpet sound before the walls of Jericho. It may, indeed,

be doubted whether, in the impetuousness of his attack, M. Keinach, though he has

rapidly brought up his reserves in his more recent work on primitive European

sculpture, has not been tempted to occupy outlying positions in the enemy's country

which will hardly be found tenable in the long run. I cannot myself, for instance,

be brought to believe that the rude marble ' idols ' of the primitive yEgean popula-

tion were copied on Chaldrean cylinders, I may have occasion to point out that the

oriental elements in the typical higher cultures of primitive Europe, such as those af

Mycenas, of Hallstatt, and J^a Tene, are more deeply rooted than M. Keinach will

admit. But the very considerable extent to which the early European civilisation

was of independent evolution has been nowhere so skilfully focussed into light as in

these comprehensive essays of M. Reinach. It is always a great gain to have the

extreme European claims so clearly formulated, but we must still remember that
the ' Sick Man ' is not dead.

The proofs of a highly developed metallurgic industry of home growth accu-

mulated by prehistoric students pari 2)assu over the greater part of Europe, and the

--considerable cultural equipment of its early population illustrated, for example,

--in the Swiss Lake settlements had already prepared the way for the more start-

ling revelations as to the prehistoric civilisation of the ^Egean world which have

resulted from Dr. Schliemann's diggings at Troy, Tiryns, and Mycenre, so admirably

followed up by Dr. Tsountas.

     This later civilisation, to which the general name of ' ^Egean ' has been given,
shows several stages, marked in succession by typical groups of finds, such as those
from the Second City of Troy, from the cist-graves of Amorgos, from beneath the

volcanic stratum of Tbera, from the shaft-graves of Mycente, and again from the
tombs of the lower town. Roughly, it falls into two divisions, for the earlier of

which the culture illustrated by the remains of Amorgos may be taken as the

culminating point, while the later is inseparably connected with the name of

Mycenae.

The early ' ^Egean ' culture rises in the midst of a vast province extending from-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          --

Switzerland and Northern Italy through the JJanubiaii basin and the Balkan

peninsula, and continued through a large part of Anatolia, till it finally reaches

Cyprus. It should never be left out of sight that, so far as the earliest historical

tradition and geographical nomenclature reach back, a great tract of Asia Minor

is found in the occupation of men of European race, of whom the Phrygians and

--their kin closely allied to the Thracians on the other side of the Bosphorua

stand forth as the leading representatives. On the other hand, the great antiquity

of the Armenoid type in Lycia and other easterly paits of Asia Minor, and its

priority to the Semites in these regions, has been demonstrated by the craniological

researches of Dr. von Luschan. This ethnographic connexion with the European

stock, the antiquity of which is carried back by Egyptian records to the second

millennium before our era, is fully borne out by the archaeological evidence. Very

similar examples of ceramic manufactures recur over the whole of this vast region.

The resemblances extend even to minutife of ornament, as is well shown by the

examples compared by Dr. Much irom the Mondsee, in Upper Austria, from the

earliest stratum of Hissarlik, and from Cyprus. It is in the same Anatolo-Danubian

-- --area as M. Reinach has well pointed out that we find the original centre of

difl'usion of the ' Svastika ' motive in the Old World. Copper implements, and

weapons too, of primitive types, some reproducing Neolithic forms, are also a

common characteristic, though it must always be remembered that the mere fact

that an implement is of copper does not of itself necessitate its belonging to the

earliest metal age, and that the freedom from alloy was often simply due to a tem-

porary deficiency of tin. Cyprus, the land of copper, played, no doubt, a leading

part in the dissemination of this early metallurgy, and certain typical pins and other

objects found in the Alpine and Danubian regions have been traced back by Dr.

Naue and others to Cypriote prototypes. The same parallelism thi'oughout this

vast area comes out again in the appearance of a class of primitive ' idols ' of clay,

marble, and other materials, extending from Cyprus to the Troad and the ^Egean

islands, and thence to the pile settlements of the Alps and the Danubian basin,

while Idndred forms can be traced beyond the Carpathians to a vast northern

Neolithic province that stretches to the shores of Lake Ladoga.

It is from the centre of this old Anatolo-Danubian ai-ea of primitive culture, in

which Asia Minor appears as a part of Europe, that the new ^Egean civilisation

rises from the sea. ' Life was stirring in the waters.' The notion that the

maritime enterprise of the Eastern Mediterranean began on the exposed and

comparatively harbourless coast of Syria and I'alestine can no longer be main-

tained. The island world of the ^Egean was the natural home of primitive navi-

gation. The early sea-trade of the inhabitants gave theui a start over their

--neighbours, and produced a higher form of culture, which was destined to react on

that of a vast European zone nay, even upon that of the older civilisations of

Egypt and Asia.

The earlier stage of this yEgean culture culminates in what may conveniently

be called the Period of Amorgos from the abundant tombs explored by Dr. Diimm-

ler and others in that island. Here we already see the proofs of a widespread

commerce.  The ivory ornaments point to the South                                                                                                                                                                                         the abundance of silver may
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

even suggest an intercourse along the Libyan coast with the rich silver-producing

region of South-eastern Spain, the very ancient exploitation of which has been so

splendidly illustrated by the researches of the brothers Siret. Additional weight

is lent to this presumption by the recurrence in these Spanish deposits of pots with

rude indications of eyes and eyebrows, recalling Schliemann's owl-faced urns ; of

stone 'idols,' practically identical with those of Troy and the yEgean islands, here too

associated with marble cups of the same simple forms ; of triangular daggers of

copper and bronze, and of bronze swords which seem to stand in a filial relation to

an ' Amorgan ' type of dagger. In a former communication to this Section I

--ventured to see in the so-called ' Cabiri ' of Malta very far removed from any
--Phoenician sculpture an intermediate link between the Iberian group and that of

the yEgean, and to trace on the fern-like ornaments of the altar-stone a comparison

with the naturalistic motives of proto-Mycensean art, as seen, for instance, on the

early vases of Thera and Therasia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     '
912 KEPORT-- 189G,

A Chaldaean influence cannot certainly be excluded from this early yEgean

art. It reveals itself, for instance, in indigenous imitations of Babylonian cylinders.

My own conclusion that the small marble figures of the ^gean deposits, though

of indigenous European lineage, were in their more developed types influenced by

Istar models from the East, has since been independently arrived at by the Danish

archaeologist, Dr. Blinkenburg, in his study on prte-Mycensean art.

More especially the returning-spiral decoration, which in the' Amorgan Period'

appears upon seals, rings, bowls, and caskets of steatite, leads us to a very interest-

ing field of comparison. This motive, destined to play such an important part in

the history of European ornament, is absent from the earlier products of the great

Anatolo-Danubian province. As a European design it is first found on these

insular fabrics, and it is important to observe that it first shows itself in the form

of reliefs on stone. The generally accepted idea, put forward by Dr. Milchhofer,

that it originated here from applied spirals on metal work is thus seen to be bereft,

of historical justification. At a somewhat later date we find this spiraliform

motive communicating itself to the ceramic products of the Danubian region,

though from the bold relief in which it sometimes appears, a reminiscence of the

earlier steatite reliefs seems still traceable. In the late Neolithic pile-station of

Butmir, in Bosnia, this spiral decoration appears in great perfection on the pottery,

mand is here associated with clay images of very advanced fabric. At Lengyel,

Hungary, and elsewhere, we see it applied to primitive painted pottery. Einally,

in tlie later Hungarian Bronze Age it is transferred to metal work.

  -- --But this connexion every link of which can be made out of the lower
--Danubian Bronze Age decoration with the .Egean spiral system itself much
--earlier in origin has a very important bearing on the history of ornament in the

North and AVest. The close relation of the Bronze Age culture of Scandinavia and

North-western Germany with that of Hungary is clearly established, and of
the many valuable contributions made by Dr. Montelius to prehistoric archaeology,

none is more brilliant than his demonstration that this parallelism of culture

between the North-west and South-east owes its origin to the most ancient

course of the amber trade from the Nortli Sea shores of Jutland by the valley

of the Elbe and Moldau to the Danubian Basin. As Dr. Montelius has also

shown, there was, besides, a western extension of this trade to our own islands.

If Scandinavia and its borderlands were the source of amber, Ireland was the land

of gold. The wealth of the precious metal there is illustrated by the fact

that, even as late as 1796, the gold washings of County Wicklow amounted to
A10,000/.
           variety of evidence shows a direct connexion between Great Britain

and Scandinavia from the end of the Stone Age onwards. Gold diadems of

-- --unquestionably British probably Irish fabric have been found in Seeland and
Fiinen, and from the analysis of early gold ornaments it clearly results that it was

from Ireland rather than the Ural that Northern and Central Europe was supplied.

Mr. Coftey, who has made an exhaustive study of the early Irish monuments,

has recently illustrated this early connexion by other comparisons, notably the

appearance of a design which he identifies with the early carvings of boats on the

rocks of Scandinavia.

  --This prolongation of the Bronze Age trade route already traced from the

            _

--Mddle Danube from Scandinavia to Ireland, ought it to be regarded as the

historic clue to the contemporary appearance of the spiral motive in the British

Islands? Is it to this earlier intercourse with the land of the Vikings that we

--must ascribe the spiral scrolls on the slabs of the great chambered barrows of the

Irish Bi'onze Age best seen in the most imposing of them all, before the portal

and on the inner chambers of New Grange ?

The possibility of such a connexion must be admitted ; the probability is great

that the contemporary appearance of the spiraliform ornament in Ireland and on the

Continent of Europe is due to direct derivation. It is, of course, conceivable that

such a simple motive as the returning spiral may have originated independently

in various parts of Europe, as it did originate in other parts of the world. But

anthropology has ceased to content itself with the mere accumulation of sporadic

coincidences. It has become a historic study. It is not sufficient to know how
                                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                             913

such and sucli phenomena viay have originated, but liow, as a matter of fact, they

did. Hence in the investigation of origins and evolution the special value of the

European field where the evidence has been more perfectly correlated and the

continuous records go further back. An isolated example of the simple volute

design belonging to the ' Reindeer Period ' has been found in the grotto of

Arudy. But the earliest cultural strata of Europe, from the beginning of the

Neolithic period onwards, betray an entire absence of the returning spiral motive.

"When we find it later propagating itself as a definite ornamental system in a

regular chronological succession throughout an otherwise inter-related European

zone, we have every right to trace it to a common source.

But it does not therefore foUow that the only alternative is to believe that the

spiral decoration of the Irish monuments necessarily connects itself with the

aucient stream of intercourse flowing from Scandinavia.

   We have to remember that the Western lands of gold and tin were the goals

of other prehistoric routes. Especially must we bear in mind the early evidence

of intercourse between the British Isles and the old Iberie region of the opposite

shores of the Continent. The derivation of certain forms of Bronze Age types in

Britain and Ireland from this side has already been demonstrated by my father,

and British or Irish bronze flat axes with their characteristic ornamentation have

in their turn been found iu Spain as well as in Denmark. The peculiar technique

of certain Irish flint arrowheads of the same period, in which chipping and grind-

ing are combined, is also characteristic of the Iberian province, and seems to lead

to very extended comparisons on the Libyan side, recurring as it does in the

exquisite handiwork of the non-Egyptian race whose relics Mr. Petrie has brought

to light at Nagada. In prehistoric Spanish deposits, again, are found the actual

wallet-like baskets with in-curving sides, the prototypes of a class of clay food-

vessels which (together with a much wider distribution) are of specially frequent

occurrence in the British Isles as well as the old Iberian area.

If the spiral decoration had been also a feature of the Scandinavian rock

carvings, the argument for derivation from that side would have been strong.

But they are not found in them, and, on the other hand, the sculptures on the

dolmens of the Morbihan equally show certain features common to the Irish stone

chambers, including the primitive ship figure. The spiral itself does not appear on

these                             but the more the common elements  between  the  Megalithic piles, not  only
                               ;

of the old Iberian tract on the mainland, including Brittany, but in the islands of

the West Mediterranean basin, are realised, the more probable it becomes that the

impulse came from this side. The prehistoric buildings of Malta, hitherto spoken

of as ' Phojuician temples,' which show in their primitive conception a great

affinity to the Megalithic chambers of the earliest British barrows, bear witness

on this side to the extension of the ^Egean spiral system in a somewhat

advanced stage, and accompanied, as at New Grange, with intermediate lozenges.

In Sardinia, as I hope to show, there is evidence of the former existence of .monu-

ments of Mycentean architecture in which the chevron, the lozenge, and the spiral

might have been seen associated as in Ireland. It is on this line, rather than on the

Danube and the Elbe, that we find in a continuous zone that Cyclopean tradition

of domed chambers which is equally illustrated at Mycenae and at New Grange.

These are not more than indications, but they gain additional force from the

converging evidence to which attention has already been called of an ancient line

of intercourse, mainly, we may believe, connected with the tin trade between the

AEast Mediterranean basin and the Iberian West.                              further corroboration of the

view that an ^Egean impulse propagated itself as far as our own islands from that

side is perhaps atforded by a very remarkable find in a British barrow.

I refer to the Bronze Age interment excavated by Canon Greenwell on Folkton

Wold, in Yorkshire, in which, beside the body of a child, were found three carved

chalk objects resembling round boxes with bossed lids. On one of these lids were

grouped together, with a lozenge-shaped space between them, two partly spirali-

form partly concentric circular ornaments, which exhibit before our eyes the

degeneration of two pairs of returning spiral ornaments. Upon the sides of two of

these chalk caskets, associated with chevrons, saltires, and lozenges, were rude
--^

--judications of faces eyes and nose of bird-like character--curiously recalling the

early ^gean and Trojan types of Dr. Schliemann. These, as M. Reinach has
pointed out, also find an almost exact parallel in the riide indications of the human

face seen on the sculptured menhirs of the Marne and the Gard valleys. To this

may he added the interesting comparisons supplied hy certain clay vessels, of
rounded form, somewhat resembling the chalk ' caskets ' discovered by MM.

Siret in Spanish interments of the early metal age, in v^hich eyes and eyebrows of

a primitive style are inserted, as on the British relics, in the inter-spaces of linear

ornamentation. The third chalk disc exhibits, in place of the human face, a

butterfly with volute antennte, reminding us of the appearance of butterflies as a

decorative motive on the gold roundels from the shaft-graves of Mycenae, as also

on early Mycenaean gems of steatite from Crete ; in the latter case with the feelers
curving outwards in the same way. The stellate design with central circles on the

lid of one of the chalk caskets is itself not impossibly a distant degeneration of the

star-flowers on the same M3-cenaean plates. Putting all these separate elements of

--resemblance together the returning spiral and star, the rude face and butterfly

the suggestion of j-Egean reminiscence becomes strong, but the other parallels lead

us for the line of its transmission towards the Iberian rather than the Scandi-

navian route.

    So much, at least, results from these various comparisons that, whether we find

the spiral motive in the extreme West or North of Europe, everything points to
the JEgean world as its first European centre. But have we any right to regard

it, even there, as of indigenous evolution ?

    It had been long my own conviction that the ^gean spiral system must itself

be regarded as an olfsboot of that of ancient Egypt, which as a decorative motive

on scarabs goes back, as Professor Petrie has shown, to the Fourth Dynasty.

During the time of the Twelfth Dynasty, which, on general grounds, may be sup-
posed roughly to correspond with the 'Amorgan Period' of ^gean culture, it
attained its apogee. The spiral convolutions now often cover the whole field of the

scarab, and the motive begins to spread to a class of black bucchero vases the chalk

inlaying of whose ornaments suggests widespread European analogies. But the

important feature to observe is that here, as in the case of the early -Egean

examples, the original material on which the spiral ornament appears is stone, and

that, so far from being derived from an advanced type of metal work, it goes back

in Egypt to a time when metal was hardly known.

The prevalence of the spiral ornamentation on stone work in the ^Egean islands

and contemporary Egypt, was it merely to be regarded as a coincidence ? To turn

one's eyes to the Nile Valley, was it simply another instance of the ' Mirage

myOrientale''? For    own part, I ventured to believe that, as in the case of

Northern Europe, the spread of this system was connected with many collateral

symptoms of commercial inter-couuexion, so here, too, the appearance of this early

jEgean ornament would be found to lead to the demonstration of a direct inter-

course between the Greek islands and Egypt at least a thousand years earlier than

any that had hitherto been allowed.

     One's thoughts naturally turned to Crete, the central island, with one face on

--the Libyan Sea-- the natural source and seminary of yEgean culture where fresh

light was already being thrown on the Mycenaean civilisation by the researches of

Professor Halbherr, but the earlier prehistoric remains of which were still unex-

plored. Nor were these expectations unfounded. As the result of three expe-
--ditions undertaken in three successive years, from the last of which I returned
--three months since
                      myit has been  fortune to collect a series of evidences of a

very early and intimate contact with Egypt, going back at least to the Twelfth

    ' A further piece of evidence pointing in this direction is supplied by one of the

chalk ' caskets.' On the upper disc of this, in the place corresponding with the
double-spirals on the other example, appears a degeneration of the same motive in a
more compressed form, resembling two sets of concentric horseshoes united at their
bases. This recurs at New Grange, and single sets of concentric horseshoes, or semi-
circles, are found both there and at Gavrinnis. The degeneration of the returning

spiral motive extends therefore to Brittany.

Dynasty, and to the earlier half of the third millennium before our era. It is
not only that in primitive deposits, like that of Ilagios Onuphrioa, scarabs, acknow-
ledged by competent archaeologists to be of Twelfth Dynasty date, occurred in
association with steatite seals presenting the ^Egean spiral ornamentation, and
with early pottery answering to that of Amorgos and the second city of Troy.

--This by itself might be regarded by many as convincing. But, what from the
--point of view of intercourse and chronology is even more important, in the same

deposit and elsewhere occurred early button-shaped and triangular seals of steatite
with undoubted indigenous copies of Egyptian lotos designs characteristic of the
same period, while in the case of the three-sided bead-seals it was possible to trace

a regular evolution leading down to Mycenaean times. Nor was this all. Through-
out the whole of the island there came to light a great variety of primitive stone
vases, mostly of steatite, a large proportion of which reproduced the characteristic

forms of Egyptian stone vases, in harder materials, going far back into the Ancient

Empire. The returning spiral motive is also associated with these,' as may be seen
from a specimen now in the collection of Dr. Naue, of Munich.

   A geological phenomenon which I was able to ascertain in the course of my

recent exploration of the eastern part of the island goes far to explain the great

importance which these steatite or ' soapstone ' fabrics played in the primitive

culture of Crete and the ^gean islands. In the valley of the Sarakina stream I

came upon vast deposits of this material, the dift'usiou of which could be further
traced along a considerable tract of the southern coast. The abundant presence

--of this attractive and, at the same time, easily workable stone then incomparably
--more valuable, owing to the imperfection of the potter's art goes far to explain

the extent to which these ancient Egyptian forms were imitated, and the conse-
quent spread of the returning spiral motive throughout the ^gean.

    In the matter of the spiral motive, Crete may thus be said to be the missing

link between prehistoric Ireland and Scandinavia and the Egypt of the Ancient
Empire. But the early remains of the island illustrate in many other ways the
comparatively high level of culture already reached by the ^Egean population in

prse-Mycensean times. Especially are they valuable in supplying the antecedent

stages to many characteristic elements of the succeeding Mycenrean civilisation.
     This ancestral relationship is nowhere more clearly traceable than in a class of

relics which bear out the ancient claim of the islanders that they themselves had
invented a system of writing to which the Phoenicians did not do more than add
the finishing touches. Alreadj', at the Oxford meeting of the Association, I was

able to call attention to the evidence of the existence of a prehistoric Cretan script

evolved by gradual simplitication and selection from an earlier picture writing.
This earlier stage is, roughly speaking, illustrated by a series of primitive seals

belonging to the 'Period of Amorgos.' In the succeeding Mycfinaean age the
script is more conventionalised, often linear, and though developments of the

earlier forms of seals are frequently found, they are usually of harder materials^

and the system is applied to other objects. .\s the result of my most recent
investigations, I am now able to announce the discovery of an inscribed pre-

historic relic, which surpasses in interest and importance all hitherto known objects
of this class. It consists of a fragment of what may be described as a .steatite

' Table of Offerings,' bearing part of what appears to be a dedication of nine letters
of probably syllabic values, answering lo the same early Cretan script that is seen
on the seals, and with two punctuations. It was obtained from the lowest level

of a Mycenaean stratum, containing numerous votive objects, in the great cave of

Mount Dikta, which, according to the Greek legend, was the birthplace of Zeus.

     This early Cretan script, which precedes by centuries the most ancient records

of Phojnician writing, and supplies, at any rate, very close analogies to what may

be supposed to have been the pictorial prototypes of several of the Phoenician
letters, stands in a direct relation to the syllabic characters used at a later date by
the Greeks of Cyprus. The great step in the history of writing implied by the
evolution of symbols of phonetic value from primitive pictographs is thus shown

to have effected itself on European soil.

  --In many other ways the culture of Mycenas that extraordinary revelation froia

tJie soil of prehistoric Greece--can be shown to he rooted iu this earlier .Egean
stratum. The spiral system, still seen in much of its pure original form on the
gold vessels and ornaments fi'om the earlier shaft-frraves of Mycen;e, is simply the

Translation into metal of the pre-existing steatite decoration.'

     The Mycensean repousse work in its most developed stage as applied to human

and animal subjects has probably the same origin in stone work. Cretan examples,
indeed, give the actual transition in which an intaglio in dark steatite is coated

witii a thin gold plate impressed into the design. On the other hand, the noblest

of all creations of the Mycentean goldsmith's art, the Vaphio cups, with their bold
reliefs, illustrating the hunting and capture of wild bulls, find their nearest analogy

in a fragment of a cup, procured by me irom Knosos, of black Cretan steatite,

with naturalistic reliefs, exhibiting a tig-tree in a sacred enclosure, an altar, and

men in high action, which in all probability was originally coated, like the intaglio,

with thin plates of gold.
      In view of some still prevalent theories as to the origin of Mycenaean art, it

is important to bear in mind these analogies and connexions, which show how
deeply set its roots are in ^Egean soil. The Vaphio cups, especiallj', from their

superior art, have been widely regarded as of exotic fabric. That the art of
an European ]iopulation in prehistoric times should have risen above that of
contemporary Egypt and liabylonia was something beyond the comprehension
of the traditional school These most characteristic products of indigenous skill,
with their spirited representations of a sport the traditional home of which
iii later times was the Thessalian plains, have been, therefore, brought from
* Northern Syria ' ! Yet a whole series of MyceniBan gems exists executed in the
same bold naturalistic style, and of local materials, such as lapis Laced;emonius,
the subjects of which are drawn from the same artistic cycle as tho.se of the cups,
and not one of these has as yet been found on the Eastern Mediterranean shores.
Like the other kindred intaglios, they all come from the Peloponnese, from Crete,
from the shores and islands of the .Egean, from the area, that is, where their
materials were procured. Their leutoid and almond-shaped forms are altogether
foreign to Semitic usage, which clung to the cylinder and cone. The finer
products of the Mycenreau glyptic art on harder materials were, in fact, the

outcome of long apprentice studies of the earlier ^Egean population, of which we
have now the record in the primitive Cretan seals, and the explanation in the vast

lieds of such an easily worked material as steatite.
     But the importation of the most characteristic Mycenaean products from

' Northern Syria ' has become quite a moderate proposition beside that which we
have now before us. In a recent communication to the French Academy of
Inscriptions, Di'. Ilelbig has re-introduced to us a more familiar figure. Driven

from his prehistoric haunts on the Atlantic coasts, torn from the Cassiterides, dis-
lodged even from his Thucididean plantations in pre-IIellenic Sicily, the Phoenician
has returned, tricked out as the true ' Mycenasan.'

    A great part of Dr. Helbig's argument has been answered by anticipation.

Regardless of the existence of a regular succession of intermediate glyptic types,

such as the ' Melian ' gems and the engraved seals of the geometrical deposits of
the Greek mainland, like those of Olympia and of the Heroeon at Argos, which

link the Mycenaean with the classical series. Dr. Helbig takes a verse of Homer
to hang from it a theory that seals and engraved stones were imknown to
the early Greeks. On this imaginary fact he builds the astounding statement

tJiat the engraved gems and seals found with Mycenaean remains must be of
foreign and, as he believes, Phcenician importation. The stray diffusion of one
or two examples of Mycenican pots to the coast of Palestine, the partial re-
semblance of some Hittite bronze figures, executed iu a more barbarous Syrian

style, to specimens of quite different fabric found at Tiryns, Mycenae, and, it may

he added, in a Cretan cave near Sybrita, the wholly unwarranted attribution to
Phoenicia of a bronze vase-handle found in Cyprus, exhibiting the typical lion-

--headed demons of the Mycenajans these are only a few salient examples of the

  reasoninji- by which the whole prehistoric civilisation of the Greek world, vo
  instinct with niituralism and individuality, is handed over to the least original
  member of the Semitic race. The absence in historic Greece of such arts as that

  of infarsia in metal work, of glass-makinp: (if true) and of porcelain-making, is
  used as a conclusive argument against their practice by an ^Egean population, of

  uncertain stock, a thousand years earlier, as if in the intervening dark ages betweea

  the primitive civilisation of the Greek lands and the Classical llenaissance no arts-
. could have been lost

       Finally, the merchants of Kefto depicted on the Egyptian monuments are once-

 --more claimed as Phoenicians, and with them though this is by no means a
 --necessary conclusion, even from the premise the precious gifts they bear, in-

  cludiug vases of characteristic Mycenasan form and ornament. All this is

  diametrically opposed to the conclusions of the most careful inquirer into the

 origins of this mysterious people, Dr. W. Max Miiller (to be distinguished from
 the eminent Professor), who shows that the list of countries in which Kefto occurs-

 places them beyond the limit of Phoenicia or of any Semitic country, and connects

 them rather with Cilicia and with Cyprus, the scene, as we now know, of important

  Mycensean plantations. It is certain that not only do the Keftiu traders bear
  articles of Mycenasan fabric, but their costume, which is wholly un-Semitic, their

 leggings and sandals, and the long double locks of hair streamicg down below their
 armpits, identify them with the men of the frescoes of Mycenaj, acd of the Vaphio*
 and Knosian cups.

       The truth is that these Syrian and Phoenician theories are largely to be traced
 to the inability to understand the extent to which the primitive inhabitants of the

 ^Egean shores had been able to assimilate exotic arts without losing their own

 individuality. The precocious offspring of our Continent, first come to man's
 estate in the ^Egean island world, had acquired cosmopolitan tastes, and already
 stretched forth his hands to pluck the fruit of knowledge from Oriental boughs.

 He had adopted foreign fashions of dress and ornament. His artists revelled in lion-

 hunts and palm-trees. His very worship was infected by the creations of foreign

  religions.

      The great extent to which the Mycenreans had assimilated exotic arts andt
 ideas can only be imderstood when it is realised that this adaptive process had
 begun at least a thousand years before, in the earlier period of ,Egean culture.

 New impulses from Egypt and Chaldsea now succeed the old. The connexion

 with Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt was of so intimate a kind that it

 can only be explained by actual settlement from the ^gean side. The abundand

 relics of ^Egeau ceramic manufactures found by Professor Petrie on Egyptian
 sites fully bear out this presumption. The early marks on potsherds discovered

 by that explorer seem to carry the connexion back to the earlier ^gean period,,
 but the painted pottery belongs to what may broadly be described as Mycenoean

 times. The earliest relics of this kind found in the rubbish heaps of Kahun,.
 though it can hardly be admitted that they go quite so far back as the Twelfth
 Dynasty date assigned to them by Mr. Petrie (c. 2500 B.C.), yet correspond with the-
 earliest Mycensean classes found at Thera and Tiryns, and seem to find their nearest
 parallels in pottery of the same character from the cave of Kamares on the northern
 steep of the Cretan Ida, recently described by Mr, J. L. Myres and by Dr. Lucio
 Mariani. Vases of the more typical Mycensean class have been found by Mr. Petrie
 in a series of deposits dated, from the associated Egyptian relics, from the reign
 of Thothmes HI. onwards (1450 B.C.). There is nothing Phoenician about these
 with their seaweeds and marine creatures they are the true products of the
 island world of Greece. The counterpart to these Mycensean imports in Egypt is
 seen in tlie purely Egyptian designs which now invade the northern shores of
 the ./Egean, such as the ceiling of the sepulchral chamber at Orchomenos, or the

--wall-paintings of the palace at Tiryns-- almost exact copies of the ceilings of the

 Theban tombs designs distinguished by the later Egyptian combination of the spiral
 and plant ornament which at this period supersedes the pure returning spiral of the
 earlier dynasties. The same contemporary evidence of date is seen in the scarabs
 and porcelain fragments with the cartouches of Queen Tji and Amenhotep III.,

found in tlie Mycensean deposits. But more than a mere commercial connexion
between the yEgean seat of Mycenrean culture and Egypt seems to be indicated by
some of the inlaid daggers from the Acropolis tombs. The subject of that repre-
sentLn" the ichneumons hunting ducks amidst the lotos thickets beside a stream
that can only be the Nile, as much as the intarsia technique, is so purely of
Egypt that it can only have been executed by a Mycensean artificer resident within

--its borders. The whole cycle of Egyptian Nile-pieces thoroughly penetrated

Mycensean art, the duck-catcher in his Nile-boat, the water-fowl and butterflies

among the river plants, the spotted cows and calves, supplied fertile motives for
the Mycensean goldsmiths and ceramic artists. The griffins of Mycense reproduce

an elegant creation of the New Empire, in which an influence from the Asiatic

side is also traceable.

The assimilation of Babylonian elements was equally extensive. It, too, as we

have seen, had begun in the earlier ^gean period, and the religious influence from

the Semitic side, of which traces are already seen in the assimilation of the more

primitive ' idols ' to Eastern models, now forms a singular blend with the Egyptian,

Weas regards, at least, the externals of cult.                  see priests, in long folding robes of

Asiatic cut, leading griffins, offering doves, holding axes of a type of Egyptian

derivation which seems to have been common to the Syrian coast, the Hittite

regions of Anatolia, and Mycen;ean Greece. Female votaries in flounced Baby-

lonian dresses stand before seated Goddesses, rays suggesting those of Shamas

shoot from a Sun-God's shoulders, conjoined figures of moon and star recall the

symbols of Sin and Istar, and the worship of a divine pair of male and female

divinities is widely traceable, reproducing the relations of a Semitic Bel and Beltis.

AThe cylinder subjects of Chaldsean art continually assert themselves : Mycensean

hero steps into the place of Gilgames or Eabani, and renews their struggles with

wild beasts and demons in the same conventional attitudes, of whicli Christian art

has preserved a reminiscence in its early type of Daniel in the lions' den. The

peculiar schemes resulting from, cr, at least, brought into continual prominence by

the special conditions of cylinder engraving, with the constant tendency to which

it is liable of the two ends of the design to overlap, deeplv influenced the glyptic

style of Mycense. Here, too, we see the same animals with crossed bodies, with

two bodies and a single head, or simply confronted. These latter affiliations to

Babylonian prototypes have a very important bearing on many later offshoots of

European                            "  The tradition of  these  heraldic  groups  preserved  by the later

          culture.

Mycensean art, and communicated by it to the so-called ' Oriental ' style of Greece,

finds in another direction its unbroken continuity in ornamental products of the

Hallstatt province, and that of the late Celtic metal workers.

  --' But this,' exclaims a friendly critic, * is the old heresy the " Mirage

Orientale'' over again. Such heraldic combinations have originated independently

--elsewhere : why may they not be of indigenous origin in primitive Europe ? '

Thev certainly may be. Confronted figures occur already in the Dordogne

caves. But, in a variety of instances, the historic and geogi-aphical connexion of

these types with the Mycensean, and those in turn with the Oriental, is clearly

made out. That system which leaves the least call on human efforts at inventive-

ness seems in anthropology to be the safest.
     Let us then fully acknowledge the indebtedness of early ^Egean culture to the

older civilisations of the East. But this indebtedness must not be allowed to obscure

the fact that what was borrowed was also assimilated. On the easternmost coast

of the Mediterranean, as in Egypt, it is not in a pauper's guise that the Mycensean

element makes its appearance. It is rather the invasion of a conquering and

superior culture. It has already outstripped its instructors. In Cyprus, which had

lagged behind the yEgean peoples in the race of progress, the Mycensean relics
make their appearance as imported objects of far superior fabric, side by side with

the rude insular products. The final engrafting on Cypriote soil of what may

be called a colonial plantation of Mycenre later reacts on Assyrian art, and
justifies the bold theory of Professor Bvunn that the sculptures of Nineveh betray

Greek handiwork. The concordant Hebrew tradition that the Philistines were
immigrants from the Islands of the Sea, the name ' Oherethim,' or Cretans, actually

applied to them, and the rehgious ties which attached ' Minoan ' Gaza to the cult
of the Cretan Zeus, are so many indications that the yEgean settlements, which in

all probability existed in the Delta, extended to the neighbouring coast of Canaan,

and that amongst other towns the great staple of the Red Sea trade bad passed

into the hands of these prehistoric Vikings. The influence of the Mycen;eans on

the later Phoenicians is abundantly illustrated in their eclectic art. The Cretan

evidence tends to show that even the origins of their alphabet receive illustration

from the earlier yEgean pictography. It is not the Mycenseans who are Phoeni-
cians. It is the Phcenicians who, in many respects, acted as the depositaries of

decadent Mycenaean art.

     If there is one thing more characteristic than another of Phoenician art, it is its
borrowed nature, and its incongruous collocation of foreign elements. Dr. Helbig

himself admits that if Mycenosan art is to be regarded as the older Phcenician, the

Phoenician historically known to us must have changed his nature. What the

Mycenaeans took they made their own. They borrowed from the designs of Babylon-

ian cylinders, but they adapted them to gems and seals of their own fashion, and

rejected the cylinders themselves. The influence of Oriental religious types is

traceable on their signet rings, but the liveliness of treatment and the dramatic

action introduced into the groups separate them, toto cwlo, from the conventional

schematism of Babylonian cult-scenes. The older element, the sacred trees and

--pillars which appear as the background of these scenes on this I hope to say
--more later on in this Section there is no reason to regard here as Semitic. It

belongs to a religious stage widely represented on primitive European soil, and

nowhere more persistent than in the West.

Mycenaean culture was permeated by Oriental elements, but never subdued

by them. This independent quality would alone be sufficient to fix its original

birthplace in an area removed from immediate contiguity with that of the

older civilisations of Egypt and Babylonia. The ^gean island world answers

admirably to the conditions of the case. It is near, yet sufficiently removed,

Wecombining maritime access with insular security.  see the difference if we

compare the civilisation cf the Hittites of Anatolia and Northern Syria, in some

respects so closely parallel with that of Mycenae. The native elements were there

cramped and trammelled from the beginning by the Oriental contact. No real

life and freedom of expression was ever reached ; the art is stiff", conventional,
becoming more and more Asiatic, till finally crushed out by Assyrian conquest.

It is the same with the Phoenicians. But in prehistoric Greece the indigenous

element was able to hold its own, and to recast what it took from others in an

original mould. Throughout its handiwork there breathes the European spirit

of individuality and freedom. Professor Petrie's discoveries at Tell-el-Amarna

show the contact of this yEgean element for a moment infusing naturalism and life

into the time-honoured conventionalities of Egypt itself.

   A variety of evidence, moreover, tends to show that during the Mycenaean

period the earlier yEgean stock was reinforced by new race elements coming from
north and west. The appearance of the primitive fiddle-bow-shaped fibula or
safety-pin brings Mycenaean Greece into a suggestive relation with the Danube
Valley and the Terremare of Northern Italy. Certain ceramic forms show the
same affinities ; and it may be noted that the peculiar ' two-storied ' structure of
the ' Villanova ' type of urn which characterises the earliest Iron Age deposits of

--Italy finds already a close counterpart in a vessel from an Akropolis grave at

Mycenae a parallelism which may point to a common Illyrian source. The

painted pottery of the Mycenteans itself, with its polychrome designs, betrays
Northern and Western affinities of a very early character, though the glaze and

exquisite technique were doubtless elaborated in the ^gean shores. Examples of

spiraliform painted designs on pottery going back to tlie borders of the Neolithic
period have been found in Hungary and Bosnia. In the early rock-tombs of Sicily

of the period anterior to that marked by imported products of the fully developed
Mycenaean culture are found unglazed painted wares of considerable brilliancy,
and allied classes recur in the heel of Italy and in the cave deposits of Liguria of

the period transitional between the use of stone and metal. The 'household gods,'

if so we may call them, of the Mycenreans also break away from the tradition of

the marble yEgean forms. AVe recognise the coming to the fore again of primitive

Eurojiean clay types in a more advanced technique. Here, too, the range of

comparison takes us to the same Northern and Western area. Here, too, in Sicily

and Liguria, we see the primitive art of ceramic painting already applied to these
Aat the close of the Stone Age.
                                 rude female clay figure found in the Arene

Candide cave near Finalmariua, the upper part of the body of which, armless

and rounded, is painted with brown stripes on a pale rose ground, seems to me to

stand in a closer relation to the prototype of a well-known Mycenaean class than
Aany known example.
                     small painted image, with punctuated cross-bands over

the breast, from a sepulchral grotto at "'k'illafrati, near Palermo, belongs to the same

early family as the bucchero types of Butmir, in Bosnia. Unquestionable parallels

to the Mycenaean class have been found in early graves in Sei'via, of which an

example copied by me some years since in the museum at Belgrade was found near

the site of tliat later emporium of the Balkan trade, Viminacium, together with

a cup attesting the survival of the primitive ^Egean spirals. These extensive

Italian and Illyrian comparisons, which find, perhaps, their converging point in the
North-Western corner of the Balkan peninsula, show, at least approximately, the

direction from which this new European impulse reached the yEgean shores.
    It is an alluring supposition that this North-Western infusion may connect itself

with the spread of the Greek race in the yEgean islands and the Southern part of

the Balkan peninsula. There seems, at least, to be a reasonable presumption in

favour of this view. The Mycenaean tradition, which underlies so much of the
classical Greek art, is alone sufficient to show that a Greek element was at least

included in the Mycenrean area of culture. Recent criticism has foimd in the

Mycensean remains the best parallel to much of the early arts and industries
recorded by the Homeric poems. The meganm of the palaces at Tiryns and

Mycena; is the hall of Odysseus ; the inlaid metal work of the shield of Achilles

recalls the Egypto-Mycensean intarsia of the dagger blades ; the cup of Nestor with

--the feeding doves, the subjects of the ornamental design the siege-piece, the lion-
--hunt, the hound with its quivering quarry all find their parallels in the works of

the Mycenaean goldsmiths. The brilliant researches of Dr. Eeichel may be said to

bave resulted in the definite identification of the Homeric body-shield with the

most typical Mycenaean form, and have found in the same source the true expla-
nation of the greaves and other arms and accoutrements of the epic heroes.

That a Greek population shared in the civilisation of Mycenae cannot reasonably

be denied, but that is far from saying that this was necessarily the only element,

or even the dominant element. Archaeological comparisons, the evidence of geo-
graphical names and consistent tradition, tend to show that a kindred race, repre-

sented later by the Phrygians on the Anatolian side, the race of Pelops and

Tantalos, the special votaries of Kybele, played a leading part. In Crete a non-

Hellenic element, the Eteocretes, or 'true Cretans,' the race of Minos, whose name

is bound up with the earliest sea-empire of the ./Egean and perhaps identical with

that of the Minyana of continental Greece, preserved their own langruage and
nationality to the borders of the classical period. The Labyrinth itself, the double-

headed axe as a symbol of the divinity called Zeus by the Greek settlers, the

common forms in the characters of the indigenous script, local names and historical

traditions, further connect these Mycenaean aborigines of Crete with the primitive
population, it, too, of European extraction, in Caria and Pisidia, and with the older

elements in Lycia.

     It is difficult to exaggerate the part played in this widely ramifying Mycenaean
culture on later European arts from prehistoric times onwards. Beyond the limits
of its original seats, primitive Greece and its islands, and the colonial plantations
thrown out by it to the west coast of Asia Minor to Cyprus, and in all probability

to Egypt and the Syrian coast, we can trace the direct diffusion of Mycenaean

products, notably the ceramic wares, across the Danube to Transylvania and

Moldavia. In the early cemeteries of the Caucasus the fibulas and other objects
indicate a late Mycenaean source, though they are here blended with allied elements
of a more Danubian character. The Mycenaean impress is very strong in Southern

 Italy, and, to take a single instance, the prevailing sword-type of that region is of
 Mycensean origin. Along the western Adriatic coast the same influence is traceable

 to a very late date in the sepulchral stelre of Pesaro and the tympanum relief of
 Bologna, and bronze Isnives of the prehistoric Greek type find their way into the
 later Terremare. At Orvieto and elsewhere have even been discovered Mycensean

 lentoid gems. In Sicily the remarkable excavations of Professor Orsi have brought

 to light a whole series of Mycenasan relics in the beehive I'ock-tombs of the south-

 eastern coast, associated with the later class of Sikel fabrics.

      Sardinia, whose name has with great probability been connected with the
 Shardanas, who, with the Libyan and yEgean races, appear as the early invaders of

Egypt, has alread}' produced a Mycenrean geld ornament. An unregarded fact

 points further to the probability that it formed an important outpost of Mycensean
 culture. In 1853 General Lamarniora first printed a MS. account of Sardinian
 antiquities, written in the latter years of the fifteenth century by a certain Gilj,
 and accompanied by drawings made in 1497 by Johan Virde, of Sassari. Amongst
 these latter (which include, it must be said, some gross fahitications) is a capital
and part of a shaft of a Mycensean column in a style approaching that of the
 fa9ade of the 'Treasury of Atreus.' It seems to iiave been found at a place near

 the Sardinian Olbia, and Virde has attached to it the almost prophetic description,
 ' colmnna Pelasyica.^ That it is not a fabrication due to some traveller from
Greece is shown by a carious detail. Between the chevrons that adorn it are seen
rows of eight-rayed stars, a detail unknown to the Myceiifean architectural decora-

 tion till it occurred on the painted base of the hearth in the mer/aron of the palace

at Mycenas excavated by the Greek Archaeological Society in 1886. In this

neglected record, then, Ave have an indication of the former existence in Sardinia
of Myceno3an monuments, perhaps of palaces and royal tombs comparable to those
of Mycense itself.

      More isolated Mycentean relics have been found still further afield, in Spain,
 and even the Auvergne, where Dr. Montelius has recognised an evidence of an old
trade connexion between the Rhone valley and the Eastern Mediterranean, in the

occurrence of two bronze double axes of ^gean form. It is impossible to do more

 than indicate the influence exercised by the Mycensean arts on those of the early

Iron Age. Here it may be enough to cite the late Mycensean parallels aflbrded by

the ^Egina Treasure to the open-work groups of bird-holding figures and the
pendant ornaments of a whole series of characteristic ornaments of the Italo-
HaUstatt culture.

     In this connexion, what may be called a sub-Myceua3an survival in the North-

western corner of the Balkan peninsula has a special interest for the Celtic West.

Among the relics obtained by the fruitful excavations conducted by the Austrian

archaeologists in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and notably in the great prehistoric

cemetery of Glasinatz, a whole series of Early Iron Age types betray distinct

--Mycensean afiinities. The spiral motive and its degeneration the concentric
--circles grouped together with or without tangential lines of connexion appear on

bronze torques, on fibulse of Mycensean descent, and the typical finger-rings witli

the besil at right angles to the ring. On the plates of other 'spectacle fibulse ' are

seen triquetral scrolls singularly recalling the gold plates of the Akropolis graves
of Mycense. These, as well as other parallel survivals of the spiral system in the

Late Bronze Age of the neighbouring Hungarian region, I have elsewhere ' ventured
to claim as the true source from which the Alpine Celts, together with many Italo-

Illyric elements from the old Venetian province at the head of the Adriatic, di-ew

the most salient features of their later style, known on the Continent as that of La

Tene. These Mycensean survivals and Illyrian forms engrafted on the ' Ilallstatt

stock were ultimately spread by the conquering Belgic tribes to our own islands, to

--remain the root element of the Late Celtic style in Britain where the older spiral
--system had long since died a natural death and in Ireland to live on to supply the

earliest decorative motives uf its Christian art.

    From a Twelfth Dynasty scarab to the book of Durrow or the font of Deerhiirst
is a far cry. But, as it was said of old, ' Many things may happen in a long time.'

"We have not to deal with direct transmission jaw saltum, but with gradual propa-
gation through intervening media. This brief survey of ' the Eastern Question in
Anthropology ' will not have been made in vain if it helps to call attention to
the mighty part played by the early .^Egean culture as the mediator between
primitive Europe and the older civilisations of Egypt and Babylonia. Adequate
recognition of the Eastern background of the European origins is not the ' Oriental
Mirage.' The independent European element is not affected by its power of assimi-

lation. In the great days of Myeente we see it already as the equal, in many ways

the superior, of its teachers, victoriously reading on the older countries from Avhich

it had acquired so much. I may perhaps he pardoned if in these remarks, availing

myself of personal investigations, I have laid some stress on the part which Crete
has played in this first emancipation of the European genius. There far earlier

than elsewhere we can trace the vestiges of primaeval intercourse with the valley
of the Nile. There more clearly than in any other area we can watch the con-
tinuous development of the germs which ga^e birth to the higher ^gean culture.

There before the days of Phoenician contact a system of writing had already been
worked out which the Semite only carried one step further. To Crete the earliest
Greek tradition looks back as the home of divinely inspired legislation and the first
centre of maritime dominion.

     Inhabited since the days of the first Greek settlements by the same race,
speaking the same language, and moved by the same independent impulses, Crete
stands forth again to-day as the champion of the European spirit against the
yoke of Asia.

2. Stone Implements in Somaliland. By H. W. Seton-Karr.

     The author exhibited at Ipswich (' Proc. Brit. Assoc.,' 1895, pp. 824-5) specimens
of Pala3olitliic implements collected in Somaliland (1893-4-5), mostly broad-

trimmed flakes of ' le Moustier ' type. He has since (1895-G) revisited the countrj^
with the special object of collecting such implements, and secured many hundreds

of them, ranging up to nine inches in length, during a journey of nineteen days, in
about 8° N. latitude, and 1,000-2,000 feet above Red Sea level. They are some-

times eroded even to a depth of -^ inch ; the eroded areas have a chalcedonic ap-
pearance, and the chipping is only preserved on the raised patches.

These are the first Palfeoliths from this part of tropical Africa. ' They seem

to be scattered all over the country, and to have been washed out of sandy or

loamy deposits by the action of rain, or in some instances to have been laid bare

by the wind. Their great interest consists in the identity of their forms with

W.those found in the Pleistocene deposits of  Europe and elsewhere. . . . Under

any circumstances this discovery aids in bridging over the interval between Palaeo-

lithic man in Britain and in India, and adds another link to the chain of evidence

by which the original cradle of the human race may eventually be identified, and

tends to prove the unity of race between the inhabitants of Asia, Africa,

and Europe in prehistoric times.' (Sir John Evans, ' Communication to the Royal

Society,' April 27, 1896.)

    On the way home the author stayed some days on the Upper Nile, and found

implements, perhaps Palaeolithic, on the undisturbed surface of the Egyptian

desert plateau.

     The author calls attention to the fact that in the later Palaeolithic age the

glacial cold may have driven Palaeolithic man towards the equator ; and that

although hitherto more Palaeolithic implements have been found in well-searched

temperate than in unexplored tropical regions, yet that under more favouraWe
conditions more Palreolithic implements were found in Somaliland than in Egypt,

and in Egypt than in Europe. He infers that Africa may have been the prim-
eval home of man, and notes the fact that Somaliland is about midway between

the sources of the Nile and the Persian Gulf, two sites which have been suggested
for the ' Garden of Eden.'

3. The Older Flint Implements of Ireland. By W. J. Knowles, M.R.I.A.

   --Locality. Large rudely made Implements have been observed by the author

 in a raised beach of sand and gravel on the N.E. coast of Ireland. Good sections
occur at the Curran near Larne, along the harbour railway, &c. Cores and imple-
ments occur at all depths to 16 ft. to 20 ft. in the gravel, and even in the estuarine clay,
below sea level, at 28 ft. (in a shaft cut for the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club).*
Similar implements are found in debris from this gravel on the shores of Belfast,

--Lough, Larne, and Island Magee."
      Weatherinf/. The implements have a thick deeply stained crust, and have
undergone protracted weathering and rolling. This weathering results from
atmospheric exposure; for flints from peat bogs and boulder clay retain their
broken surfaces fresh. Successive layers of weathering seem to indicate repeated
arrest of the process, i.e. repeated burial. Neolithic implements very rarely have
any such weathered surface crust, and those actually found on this raised beach
show no signs of it.

     At Ballyrudder, se^en miles north of Larne, a glacial gravel with shells, over-

lain by 30 ft. of boulder clay, yield flints fresh, slightly and deeply weather-

stained.

     At Whitepark Bay, co. Antrim, neolithic settlers have carried away, to sites
among the sandhills, the weathered cores and flakes from the raised beach, and
worked them up into fresh implements, which still show the older flaked surfaces.
Their new surfaces, however, are still fresh.^

     Similar old cores and flakes in a reworked condition have been found by the

author at Portstewart, co. Derry ; Dundrum, co. Down ; Glenluce, Scotland ; and

elsewhere.

   --Forms. Three types of implement found, besides flakes :

      1. Chipped all over: usually triangular in section, with a blunt point at each
end.

      2. Split pebbles («) chipped to a point, {b) dressed to a circular shape as
knives or scrapers.

     3. Partially and irregularly dressed to a pear shape, with extreme economy of
labour ; but certainly intended, in the author's opinion, as striking weapons.

   --Age, .The raised beach has yielded a mammoth tooth ; and as, according to

Professor Boyd Dawkins,* it is highly probable the mammoth is preglacial in
Ireland, the associated implements may be so too. Some bear strias which have

been pronounced to be glacial.

Stone Age on ice-worn and other roclc sui faces; common in the Cheviot Hills j
occasionally found inside Brocks ; not conOned to Scotland. The authoress believes
that they were used for purposes of divination.

    .3. Ogham inscriptions : the earliest indigenous alphabetic script.
    4. Bimic inscriptions : the characters of which are raodilied from the Roman

alphabet.

     5. Christian monumental art : represented by the schools of St. Ninian, of
lona, of Arbroath, of St. Andreics, and of Fearn Ablieg. In the East its rise is
gradual ; the stones are large, upiight, carved on both sides, one of which has
always a cruciform scheme. Ships are not represented, but riding, hunting, and
frequently fighting with crossbows and spears. There are no inscriptions, but
symbolic devices occur. In the West the sword is more frequent than the cross-,
and tlie latter is always small. Ships and short inscriptions are frequent, but
symbols are absent,'

     6. The ' Brochs ' of Scotland {with Model). By Miss C. Maclagan.

     The 'Brocks' are buildings of rough masonry, with a circidar enclosure open
to the sky, and sometimes surrounded by a portico about 8 feet from the ground.
The height varies from 30 feet to 4.j ieet, and the diameter in proportion. The
encircling wall, which is often built hollow, is from 9 feet to 20 feet thick. The
 entrance is by a doorway in the outer wall, closed by a massive doorstone never
 more than 2^ feet wide, and therefore not intended to admit long-horned cattle, as
 has been supposed. The door is secured by a stone bolt, and could not be opened
 or closed from without ; therefore the brocks cannot be sepulchres. Secondary
 chambers in the thickness of the wall, reached by a spiral staircase similarly con-
 structed, and opening by windows into the inner court, seem to indicate that the
 brocks were fortified dwellings. There is sometimes a doorkeeper's chamber below,
 and often a look-out opening in the top of the wall. Tliese structures are often
 surrounded by a fortified enclosure of large stones set vertically, which have been

 mistalien for ' Druidic ' circles.

measurement in connection with British stone circles which he believes to be the
same in principle and often in detail. The measurements of the circles at Stanton

Drew by Mr. Dymond, and of those on Bodmin Moor by the author, show that
there was in all the same fundamental idea of expressing something by propor-

tioned measurements, although the unit of measurement and the manner of usinsr
it were different in each case. It may therefore be contended that, though the

circles were sometimes used for burials, they were not, as some have suggested, merely

the outer railings of family cemeteries, but had other objects and meanings, which
it is worth some pains to discover.

             9. PalceoUths Derived and Re-worked. By H. Stopes.

     Great numbers of worked stones are being continually found in the terrace
gravels of the Lower Thames Valley. The worked surfaces of the majority of
these implements are of the .same date as the latest deposition of the gravel, but a
considerable number give unmistakable evidence that they have been derived from
older gravels, so that their more recent fashioners and users have utilised stones
which already had attained great antiquitj-. Some, nevertheless, still show that

they had been skilfully fashioned into form, and had been largely used by man

once, or, in rarer cases, twice before. Eighty such stones were exhibited, which is
less than two per cent, of the number obtained from the gravels of the Kentish
shore, all at or above the level of 70 feet above O.D. Commonly abcut one worked
stone in seven found in this position gives signs of reworking, but the proportion
of such stones is largest in the higher terraces.

                                and John Beddoe, M.D., F.R.S.

\ This Paper consists mainly of an analysis by Mr. Moore of the ' Description

    native Manxmen, enrolled between 1803 and 1810. Their average stature was

5 feet 7"63 inches (1,715 mm.), wliicli is probably about equal to that of the general

population of the Isle of Man. It seems to be highest in the north-western

parishes, where also darL: hair and dark eyes are least prevalent. Dark hair,

usually coupled with grey eyes, is most abundant in the somewhat rough and in-

fertile  parishes of  Maughold  and Lonan                                               while  dark  eyes are comparatively fre-
                                                                                     ;

quent in the central parishes, which contain the two towns of Douglas and Peel,

where the Scandio-Gaelic stock is probably less pure.

3. The Trinil Femur (Pithecanthropus erectus) contrasted with the Femora
    of various Savage and Civilised Races. By David Hepburn, M.D.,
    F.R.S. Ed., Lecturer on Regional Anatomy in the University of

     Edinburgh.

     In this paper the Trinil femur was criticised from the standpoint claimed for

it by Dr. Dubois, namely, that it presents a conjunction of three features not

found on human femora :

     1. ' The trochanteric line is less raised.'
     2. ' The shaft is on the inner side far more round.'
     3. ' The popliteal space is less developed, convex in its middle, so that at this
height the shaft is almost round instead of flattened.'

     According to Dr. Dubois this last feature has never been found by him ' in
human femora, even separately.'

     Dealing especially with the popliteal space, the author presented the results of

a detailed examination of the varied collection of human femora in the Anatomical
Museum of the University of Edinburgh, in which he followed the methods of
enquiry adopted by Professor ManoiuTier, of Paris.

     The femora examined in this research were : 13 Maori, 14 Aboriginal
Australian, 12 Andamanese, 5 Sandwich Islands, 4 Lapp, 4 Eskimo, 6 Hindu,
2 Bengalee, 2 Sikh, 2 Malay, 2 Chinese, 2 Bushman, 2 Kaffir, 9 Negro, 2 Creole,
1 Egyptian, 3 Guanche, and several dozens of British femora obtained from the
dissecting-room and used for the ordinary purposes of anatomical teaching.

    As the majority of these race femora formed natural pairs, attention was drawn
to the absence of symmetry existing between the two femora of the same

individual.

     Reference was made to the signification of the antero-posterior diameters of the

popliteal region which Professor Manouvrier has symbolised as mn' ' and ' mp,'
and attention drawn to the fact that ' mp '>'mn ' implies either flattening or con-

vexity of this surface, which in modern European femora tends to show concavity,

and therefore ' mp '< ' mn.'

The      author has   found  mp mn' >·'                  '  in the following femora :                Lapp  1,  Eskimo 1,
                                                      '

Maori 1, Hindu 2, Negro 3, Bushman 2, Andaman 5, Aboriginal Australian 4,

Guanche 2, British 4.

Measiirements and indices of these femora were given and their significance

commented upon, in the course of which the factors concerned in producing a high

popliteal index were criticised and their fallacies pointed out.

In an Australian femur from Swan Hill, N.S.W., the same popliteal measure-

ments and index as given for the Trinil femur were obtained.

The difierences in the popliteal indices of the two femora forming a natural

pair were given and commented upon, in order to show that the appearances found

in one bone form no certain guide to the state of its fellow.

The author therefore claims convexity of the popliteal surface of the femur as a

human character, and, moreover, he has seen the condition of the anterior intertro-

chanteric line, and the convexity of the inner aspect of the femoral shaft conjoined

on one bone, as in the Trinil femur, e.f/. in Australian and Negro femora.

In endeavouring to explain the causes of convexity of the popliteal surface the

author divided them into normal and pathological groups.

In the former he referred to mechanical needs for resisting strain, and to the

special features resulting from muscular and aponeurotic attachments.
   ·

   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                   927

        The pathological causation of convexity of the popliteal surface beiii^ admis-
   sible by reason of the rwostuses shown by the Trinil femur, the author drew

   attention to the intluence of rachitis in producing convexity of the popliteal

   surface.

        Finally, special reference was made to the condyles of the Trinil femur, which are
   human and not simian in type.

      --The author arrives at the following conclusions :

        1. The distinguishing features of the Trinil femur are found both singly and
   in conjunction on human femora, with sufficient frequency to enable them to rank
   as human characters.

        2. The features of the Trinil femur do not entitle it to the distinction of a sepa-
   rate genus, but it is a human femur which, from the geological horizon connected

   with its discovery, associates the genus Homo with a period immensely more

   remote than any former discovery of man's remains.
         Reasoning from the above conclusions, with regard to the femur, either the

   skull-cap and the molar teeth discovered by Dr. Dubois were also parts of a

   human being, or it has yet to he proved tliat they really formed parts of the
   individual who provided the femur.

           4. Proportions of the Human Body. By J. G. Gaeson, M.D.

        The author began by giving a short historical outline of the study of the canon
   of proportion of the human body from the time of the Ancient Egyptians to the

   present. The Egyptian canon showed that the models from whom it was made

   out were negroes. The Greeks appear to have adopted that of the Egyptians.
   The canon of modern artists is essentially an ideal one, apt to vary as opinions
   change. The first real attempt at a scientific canon was that of Quetelet ; it was,
   however, based upon too small a number of observations. The canon which has
   been published by Professor Topinard of Paris is much more reliable. As a
    number of circumstances would appear to modify the proportions of the people of
    difierent countries, such as the race elements of which a nation is composed, the

    social condition of the models, climatic conditions, &c., the author considered that
    no better data could be obtained for establishing the true canon of the people of

    Great Britain than the measurements which were made in the anthropometric
    laboratory of the British Association on its members during seven successive
    meetings, the models being persons living under the most favourable conditions of
    life. The method of obtaining the mean dimensions of each measurement, so as to
    eliminate causes of error, was explained. The mean stature thus obtained is

    5 ft. 7 1 in. This being taken as 100, the proportions of the various parts of the
    head and face, as well as the trunk and limbs, were shown expressed in per-
    centages. The head is 12'6 per cent., the neck and trunk 40, the lower limbs 47*5,

    the arm 43"1, the span 102'3. The canon of the head and of the span indicated,
    differ considerably from that of artists.

         The paper will be published in full in the Journal of the Anthropological

     Institute.

3. An Imperial Bureau of Ethnology. By C. H. Read, Sec. S.A.,

Keeper of the Elhnogi-aphical DejMrtment of the British Museum.

The author proposed the establishment of a bureau in London, in which should

be gathered information relating to the manners and customs, religious beliefs, and

laws of all the primitive races inhabiting the British Colonies, or upon the borders

of the Empire. He strongh' urged that it was not only the duty of the Govern-

ment to place on record such fpcts connected with races that were in a condition

either of decay or of constant change, but that it would be to the interest of the

nation to have such information at hand. He contended that the possession of

such facts would enable the settler or traveller to avoid many misunderstandings

Awith natives that are now so prolific a cause of disaster.  valid reason for the

prompt establishment of such a bureau is, in Mr. Read's opinion, that the

machinery for the collection of the necessary data already exists ; that such officers

as those of the Intelligence branch of the War Office, the surgeons in the navy,

and many others, are quite competent to furnish such returns as are required by

the bureau ; and if they obtained credit at home for inteUigence in this direction,
many men of these branches of the service would be very ready to spend their

leisure in such pursuits. Thus only a small stall' at home would be required for

arranging and editing the material. Mi. Read spoke in the highest terms of the

work done by the United States Bureau of Ethnology which the government of

--that country had thought it worth while to establish and endow for the preserva-

tion of memorials of a single race that of the American Continent.

                                  By Sidney H. Ray.

    The purpose of the author was to reaffirm the danger of delay in commencing an

investigation of the Anthropology of British New Guinea, and to call attention to

the opportunities which exist at the present time for successfully carrying out a
system of ethnographical and philological enquiry. If anything is to be done, it
should be done soon. Already there are signs of change, customs and languages
are dying out before the advance of civilisation. Stress is laid upon languages as
folk-lore, religious beliefs, and practices, and legal customs can only be thoroughly

fitudied through the medium of the languages. AVe want to know the native's reason

for his thought and practice. An European observer will make his observations

from his own standpoint, and, without a knowledge of inner motives, will often
draw the most erroneous conclusions from native practices. The opportunity
besides being in time is also fortunate in circumstances. The country is singularly
quiet and safe for Europeans. Sir William MacGregor says : ' In gaining the
confidence and respect of the natives the Government has been more successful
than could ever have been expected. They begin to think in may places that
whatever is ordered or required by the Government is right. They fear the

Government g^reatly.' Other advantages are the facilities which would douhtless
be afforded by the ISIew Guinea Government. It is fortunate for anthropological
science that the affairs of the Possession are in the hands of so enlightened au
administrator as Sir William MacGregor. Lastly, the cost would not be exces-

sive.

    The following Papers and Report were read :

                  1. Cyprus and the Trade Routes of S.E. Euro}^.

                        By John L. Myees, M.A., F.S.A.

    Several considerations indicate that Cyprus may have been the first centre of

oopper-working in the Mediterranean, and that the knowledge of copper in Europe
was probably derived hence, rid Asia Minor, Ilissarlik and the Dardanelles, and
the valley routes of the Ilebros, Morawa and Danube.

     1. Copper LS found abundantly and accessibly in Cyprus; but is not here asso-
ciated with tin. Cyprus had in early times abundant supplies of timber, in fact
all the necessaries for an extensive and easy manufacture. There is, however, no
native copper, which corresponds with the fact that the early implements in Cyprus
appear to be usually cast.

    2. The Copper Age in Cj'prua seems to overlap the Stone Age of the Levant,
     o. The persistence of early types in Cyprus would be inexplicable if Cyprus
had been importing implements from the more progressive areas of the yEgean and
the Danube basin. The late arrival in Cyprus of both tin and amber confirms this
supposition. The view that copper implements are simply bronze weapons made

during a scarcity of tin fails to account for the predominance of primitive types

among the pure copper weapons.
     4. Cypriote types determine those of the neighbouring mainland, and of the
930 REPORT--1896.

earliest implements of Hissarlik and Central Europe ; tliough local industries soon
arise in Central Europe, and outstrip the parent industry.

     5. Tlie Bronze Age pottery of Cyprus is followed in fabric and ornament, and
to some extent in forms, by the pottery of Hissarlik and Central Europe at tbe
point where copper implements first appear. As this Cypriote pottery itself does
not seem to have been exported northward, the knowledge of the fabric must have
been introduced in connection with some other object of commerce, presumably

Avith the copper.

     6. The fully-developed Copper Age in Cyprus can be dated by objects of

Egyptian twelfth-dynasty styles ; and the beginnings of copper-working in Cyprus
must consequently be earlier.

     7. The early existence of a trade route between south-west Asia Minor and the
Danube valle}' is indicated by the catalogue of the allies of Troy in Homer's

Iliad II. The Trojan War may represent an attempt on the part of the ^Egean

thalassocracy to force a way into the Euxine, and obtain possession of the fortress
which commanded the ferry on the older land route.'

       2. The Transition from Pure Copper to Bronze made ivith Tin.

                          By Dr. J. H. Cladstone, F.R.S.

     This communication was supplementary to a paper read at the Meeting at
Nottingham three years ago, and to matters published in the Proceedings of the
Society of Biblical Archaeology for March 1890, February 1892, and February
189-1. The new matter consisted mainly of the analysis of some metal tools
obtained by the author last winter in Egypt, and of borings of implements of the
supposed Libyan race found at Nagada, and of a dagger-knife from Cyprus, which
had been given him by Mr. Arthur Evans.

     The use of copper in Egypt can be traced from the fourth dynasty, when
King Seneferu captured the copper and turquoise mines of the Sinaitic peninsula.
Tools made of this metal have been found not only in Egypt, belonging to the

fourth, sixth, and twelfth dynasties, but also in Assyria, at Lachish in Palestine,
HissarUk in Asia Minor, and Nagada. Attempts were made to render this copper
harder and stronger, and that in three ways. First, the admixture of a large
 quantity of suboxide of copper, or of its formation in the process of smelting, as
seen in adzes from Egypt and Palestine, and perhaps Nagada. Second, the

presence of a little arsenic or antimony, as shown in many tools from Kaliun
dating from the twelfth dynasty, and from the Sinaitic mines, as shown in a com-
munication to the French Academy by Berthelot a few weeks since. Third, the
 admixture of a little tin, as at Kahun, the Sinaitic mines, and Cyprus, perhaps not
exceeding one per cent. When, however, the superiority of tin, as the hardening
material, came to be acknowledged, it was added in larger quantities, and formed
the alloy known as bronze. Such proportions as four and six per cent, occur in
early specimens, as at Hissarlik ; but subsequently about ten per cent, was usually
 employed. Tools of this composition are found not only in Egypt during the
 eighteenth dynasty, but in most countries, and for an immense variety of purposes.

      This indicates a large traffic in the metals, and probably in the manufactured
tools themselves. The similarity of pattern observed in the instruments is also
 suggestive of the latter hypothesis.

         3. Hallstatt and the Starting-jioint of the Iron Age in Europe.

                        By Professor W. Ridgeway, M.A.

     The origin of the Iron Age is one of the most important points in European
 archseology. Scandinavia cannot be its place of origin, for there the Iron Age

began late. It is admitted that the Iron Age comes in jjer saltum in Swiss lake
dwellings, in Italy, in Greece, in France, and in Britain. Iron is found going with

the Kelts into these various regions.
     Hallstatt, in Austria, is the only place in Europe where articles of iron are

found gradually replacing those of the same kind made in bronze. It has not been

hitherto pointed out that within a very short distance of the Hallstatt cemetery
lies one of the most famous iron mines of antiquity. Strabo (v. i. 8) tells us
of the ironworks of Noreia, the chief town of the Keltic Taurisci, which gave its

name to Noricum, and to the Noricus ensis so dreaded by the Eomans.
    From this centre the use of iron spread into Italy, Switzerland, Gaul, Spain,

Greece, and into Eastern Germany, where the mining of iron by the Keltic
Cotini is mentioned by Tacitus (Germ. 43).

    At many places in the Alps it is possible that there may have been outcrops of
terrestrial iron. Men would thus iind ready to hand sources of iron, and there is
no need to suppose that meteorites first supplied him with that metal.

  4. The Tyrrhenians in Greece and Italy. ^ By Dr. Oscar Montelius.

     The author brings a gi'eat variety of evidence in support of the following con-

clusions :

     1. That the Oriental civilisation long before 1500 B.C. was brought over to the
Greek coasts and isles.

     2. That during this so-called Mycenean period an influence can also be traced
in Greece from the Phcenicians and from Egypt.

     3. But that the main influence came from Asia Minor.
     4. That it was due to the immigration of peoples from this part of Asia.
     5. That these are the peoples generally called Pelaagi or Tyrrhenians by the
Greek authors.
     6. That the Oriental civilisation advanced farther to the West, and was intro-
duced in the eleventh century B.C. into that part of Central Italy which the
Romans called Etruria and the Greeks Tyrrlienia.
     7. That it was due, there also, to the immigration of a people of Oriental origin^
the Tyrrhenians, coming from over the sea, not over the Alps. This people was
consequently a non-Italian one. The question is reserved whether it was of
Aryan race or not.

     The Barony of Corkaguiney, co. Kerry, is remarkable for the number and
interest of its antiquities ; and foremost among these must be placed a settlement
of stone-built dwellings at its south-west corner, between Uuumore Head and

--Ventry Harbour. These consist of beehive-shaped houses single, double, and

triple, some alone, some congregated together, and surrounded by a strong enclosing

wall. In the modern village of Oonmeenoole, at the western end of the settle-

ment, the ancient style of building is perpetuated in some of the cow-houses.

The most remarkable building is Dunbeg Fort, a great wall 22 feet thick, cutting

off a tongue of laud which projects into the sea, and on which is built one of the

linest of the domestic buildings. The whole settlement has suffered by recent

restorations.

Though the settlement is not unlike the monastic remains of the west of Ireland

bi some respects, it is in others widely different from them, especially in size, in

the absence of any distinctly ecclesiastical buildin* contemporary with the rest,

and in the prevalence of multiple clochans or houses. The fact that a stone was

found in Caher Glengaun, used as building material, which bears Christian

symbols, proves nothing but that this particular building probably dates from the

Pagan-Christian overlap. On the other hand, an Ogham inscription on Dunmore

Head, which is entirely destitut'? of any trace of Christian influence, and which

probably commemorates some notable resident in the settlement, seems to put the

latter back to Pagan times. The person commemorated v^-as a descendant of

Duibne, the ancestress of the clan from whom the JJarony of Corkaguiney is

named.

The people were agricultural, and open to the attacks of enemies, especially

Afrom Yentrj- ; this is evident from an examination of the remains.                  great battle

XV'as at some time fought at "\'entry ; the historical facts are obscured by fictitious

Jiccretions, but the site is still in existence, showing some remarkable earthworks.

The conclusion to be drawn from tliese remains is, that Ptolemy and other

ancient geographers were right in asserting the existence of towns, i.e. centres of

a concentrated population, in ancient Ireland, and that archfeologists have been

Avrong in denying their existence. Other places might be mentioned where the

magnitude of the remains proves the former existence of such centres, but their

iiabitations in these places not being of stone, have all perished.

     The three following Papers were read as contributions to a discussion on the
Early Civilisation of the Mediterranean.

1. ' Who Produced the Objects called Mykencean ? '· By Prof. W. Ridgeway.

     The discovery of Mjken.Tan remains in various parts of the Greek world out-
side of Peloponnese, such as Attica, Thessaly, Crete, Cyprus, Rhodes, Egypt, Asia
3Iinor, Italy and Sicily, makes it desirable to re-examine the question of the origin
of these remains. In I'eloponnese and Crete we are fairly limited to the same
possibilities of race. For in Peloponnesos either the Greeks of classical times, or
the Achffians of the Homeric Age, or the older race, who preceded the Achseans,
iind who, according to the consensus of Greek history, continued to occupy Arcadia
in historical times, must be the producers of the objects termed Mykenrean.

   --Homer enumerates -' the races which occupied Crete viz., Eteocretes, Kydonians,

Achfeaus, Dorians, and Pelasgians. As there is no evidence that the tirst two ever
played any important part in I'eloponuese, they may be jetisoned, and the claim for
precedency must be fought out by the same three as in Peloponnese.

     I. Pusolt and others put forth a claim for the Dorians as the builders of My-

kenaj and Tiryns, but as this not only gives the lie direct to all Greek history, but
also makes the Dorians build the walls of Tiryns, and create beautiful works of

--art though in historical times they were notoriously incapable in building and

     :.'. It then rests between Achseans and the older race, who were called Pelas-

gians by the Greeks. Homer gives us a picture of a culture which Schliemana

and Ilelbijr (till lately), followed by most scholars, have sought to identify with

that of i\Iykena7. This involves many difiiciilties : (1) The age of Mykenre is that

of Bronze ; that of Homer's Achieans is distinctly of /;·««. {'2) Euffiared c/ems are

characteristic of 3Iyken«?, but such engraved gems, used either as gignets or as-

ornaments, are unknown to Homer. (3) Isojidnlce have been found in the Acroi)olis
of MykeniX", but Homer's Achreans use them to keep on their dress. (4) The My-
kenKans were skilled in painting, but when Homer mentions it he speaks of it as
' Carian ' art. (")) The Mykenseans had a peculiar oblong shield, like the figure 8

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

they had no breastplate, no greaves of metal, and wore their hair in three locks

behind ; whilst the Achteans had round shields, bronze breastplates and greaves,

and wore their hair flowing.
     To obviate such difficulties Ileichel,' followed by Leaf, would make wholesale

excision of passages which describe Achrean warriors as armed with round shields,
breastplates, and greaves. But such passages cannot be ' late,' even though
later than some other parts of the poems : for if interpolation had been practised
in late times, we should have the use of coined money, signets, and alphabetic

writing, colonies in Asia Minor and Italy, and Dorians in Peloponnese, alluded to as

the}' are by the tragic poets when they treat of the Heroic Age.
     3. The Greeks themselves thought that Mykenre and Tiryns were built before

the Achreans entered Ptloponnese, and by the Pelasgians. The Greek historians
declared that Attica was never inhabited by any other race than the Pelasgians,
and as Mykenasan remains have been found in abundance in Attica, the conclusion
is that it was the same race who made similar monuments in Peloponnese.

     There is no need to cut Homer to pieces to fit the Mykenasan Age. The

Achreans came into Peloponnese marrying the heiresses of the kings of the older

--race e.<7.,Menelaos married the daughter of Tyndaros.

     The Mykenfean culture is that of the Bronze period, which was supplanted by
the Iron -Vge, which was introduced by the Achseansinto Greece.

                   2. Preclassical Chronology in Italy and Greece.'^

                             By Dr. Oscar Montelius.

     For chronological purposes, Italy and Greece must be taken together, because
their early culture has a large common element, and because whereas Greek
evidence supplies the more accurate date-marks, Italy afi'ords a vastly larger mass
of material hitherto, owing to the more scientific manner in which the content of
each tomb has been registered in recent Italian excavations.

     The author's examination of the extant evidence enables him to construct a
reh/tive chronology of short intervals, which divides the Bronze Age into seven
periods, and the Iron Age in Central Italy, down to the end of the YIth century,

B.C., into si.c more.

     During the Bronze Age the evolution was the same in Northern and in
Central Italy ; but from the beginning of the Iron Age the development iu

Etruria, south of the Apennines, is quite distinct from that in Northern Italy.
     The typological analysis shows evolution within each period ; the periods'them-

selves, therefore, must hr.ve been of considerable length, each period of the Iron
Age in Central Italy being of the approximate length of a century

     The absolute clu'onology is fixed by the occurrence of a series of exactly
dateable objects imported from Greece in the eighth to fifth centuries b c, and
associated in Italian tombs with objects characteristic of successive periods in tho
lower part of the series. The result of the Author's analysis is to raise to the
ninth century B.C. certain tombs (the Regulini-Galassi tomb at Cervetri, &c.) com-

monly assigned to the time about 600 B.C., and to expand the whole series upwards
in proportion. The fifth period of the Italian Bronze Age is proved by fibulae,
Greek pottery, and Egyptian scarabs to be contemporaneous with Amenhotep III.,

of the XVIIIth Egyptian Dynasty, who lived in the XVth century, b.c.

                3. Pillar and Tree Worship in Mycenaean Greece.
                        By Arthur J. Evans, M.A., F.S.A.

    New evidence, supplied by finds in Crete and the Peloponnese, is brought for-

ward to show the great part played in the Mycenrean religion by the worship of
deities in aniconic shape as stone pillars or as trees. On a gold ring obtained by
Mr. Evans from the site of Knosos in Crete, and dating from the early Mycenaean
period (about 1500 B.C.), a dual cult of a male and female divinity in their pillar
shape is illustrated, and an armed Sun-god is being brought down on to his obelisk
or ' Beth-el ' by ritual incantation. Parallels to this dual cult of deities in a
columnar form are cited from Cypriote cylinders of Mycenaean date, and the later
cone of Aphrodite at Paphos is shown to be a survival of a cult once common to
prehistoric Greece, and of ' yEgean ' rather than Semitic importation into Cyprus.
Various religious designs on signets recently discovered by Dr. Tsountas at My-
cenae are described for the first time, which throw additional light on the cult of
Mycenaean deities in the shape of pillars and trees enclosed in small shrines, and
the column of the Lion's Gate at Mycenae is identified with the aniconic idol of the
Phrygian goddess Kybele, whose anthropomorphic image later supplants the piUar
form in the same position between the lion supporters. It is pointed out that a
confusion seems at times to have taken place between the pillar form of the divi-
nity and the tombstone of the god himself, or some allied hero who is really his
double ; and reasons are adduced for identifying the traditional ' Tomb of Zeus
in Crete with the remains of a prehistoric sanctuary visited by Mr. Evans on
Mount Juktas. Attention is further called to a low-walled building in the great
Mycenaean city of Goulas, in the same island, as probably actually representing

one of the small shrines which contained a sacred tree. An interesting fragment

of a Mycenasan steatite vase also obtained by the author from the site of Knosos
is described, in which an altar appears in front of a stone enclosure containing a
sacred fig tree, and the cult of this tree, illustrated by other Mycenaean relics, is
compared with that of t\iQjicus rumitialis in Ancient Rome, where (as in Cyprus)
the traditional Arcadians represent a Mycenaean influence. The early sanctity of
the dove is also seen associated throughout Mycenaean Greece with this primitive
worship, and new evidence is adduced as to the part played by it in the religion of
prehistoric Crete. Finally, the pillar and tree worship of Mycenaean Greece is
seen largely to survive in the rustic cult of classical Greece at a time when in the
more civilised centres the images of the gods had been mainly anthropomorphised.
This is illustrated by the rural sanctuaries with their sacred trees and stones so
well represented on the Pompeian frescoes.

The earlier Celtic examples are mostly undecorated ; the Calf of Man crucifix

Is an unique, elaborately-carved specimen of the early ninth century. Celtic

crosses are also found of the tenth and early eleventh centuries.

The Hcandinaviafi crosses are dated by style and inscriptions to the eleventh

and following centuries. The style gradually becomes bolder, though it lacks

accui-acy, and later fails through over- elaboration. Celtic geometrical patterns

and ' tendril ' and ' loop ' forms of ' twist ' are developed with much artistic skill,

and the characteristic Scandinavian ' vertebral ' motive is introduced. The absence

of foliage, of panel arrangement, and of diagonal and spiral patterns, and the

characteristic type of zoomorphism, are also derived from the Celtic prototypes.

  An --analysis of Manx decorative art Geometric, Zoomorphic, and Pictoi'ial

                                     By Professor W. M. Flinders Petrie, D.C.L.

MEJIORAIfDUM: OTS PROPOSED REPOSITORY FOR PRESERVING ANTHROPOLOGICAL
     OR OTHER Objects. (Drawn xip hy Professor Flinders Petrie, for the
     use of a Committee of the Council.)

  --Necessity. The impossibility of preserving more than a small portion of the

material for anthropology in the very limited area of London or town museums

--leaves only the alternatives of (1) the destruction of materials which can never

be replaced, illustrating modern races that are fast disappearing, and ancient races

as revealed by excavation ; or (2) the storing of such materials accessibly in a
locality and a manner which shall yield the greatest possible storage space for a

given expenditure.

   --Scope. Such a repository might be solely anthropological, including an example

of every variety of object of human work of all ages. Or it might be extended to

zoology, mineralogy, geology, &c. Here we only consider the human side.

The minimum use of such a place would be only to store the surplus objects

which cannot find place in existing museums.

The maximum development of it would be to form a systematic scientific

collection of man's works, ancient and modern, reserving to existing museums such

objects as illustrate the subject best to the general public, and such as need the

protection due to their market value. All such exhibition objects could be

properly replaced in the repository collection by photographs.

If fully developed such a repository would become a centre for study and

higher education ; a reference library would then be needed ; but the value of

land would be so enhanced that further expenditure would be covered by rents

of adjacent ground.

  --Form. The conditions of such a repository are so wholly difierent from

those of existing museums that the proportions of expenditure are entirely

changed. The essential and primary condition is that space shall be of minimum

value                           and  therefore wages  and the                       cost  of  moving  objects and arranging them
                             ;

will be a far larger item in proportion. It is therefore needful that changes shall

not be necessitated by any amount of expansion.

The type of structure must therefore be a long gallery, with lateral expan-

sions to be built as any section increases. The galleries must be sufliciently apart

to allow of any likely increase, irregularly distributed.

The type of gallery which would seem most economical would be about 54
                                                                                  --;

feet wide, divided into a navo aud two aisles across the breadtb, and into bays of

A16 feet along the length.  blocked doorway in each bay would allow of opening

laterally, into added buildings, for expansion of any section. It should be well

lighted, about one-fourth of the roof to be of glass. The walls should be low

--say 10 feet so that the area of lighting would be near the objects.

The essence of the scheme is that the site shall be ordinary agricultural or

wooded land, so that a space far larger than is likely to be wanted can be utilised

for irregular expansion as any section grows ; while all tliat is not actually in use

for galleries will continue to be productive, as before, Thus every possible need

of the future can be accommodated without incurring more immediate expense

than is now requisite, and without any loss of interest on capital not utilised.

For this purpose it Avould not be unreasonable to secure about 500 acres, in view

also of the probable rise in the value of land for building as such an institution

grew. On this land galleries of 54 feet wide, built in blocks of 100 bays or 1,600

feet length at once, should be placed at about a furlong a])art. This would allow

of each galleiy expanding on either side for about 250 feet of outbuilding.

Each gallery should have in the middle of its length a policeman's cottage

--(fire-proof), with its windows looking along the inside of t he gallery.
     Site. The site thould be within about half an hour's journey fi'om London.

Flat, for view along the galleries. Healthy for rusidence. Fairly dry, and sandy

if possible. Wooded, so that belts of trees should occupy the spaces between

the galleries, and thus reduce the effect of wind and rain. Near a railwaj-

but, for cheapness, far from a station, as the institution would soon claim a

Astation for its own use.  siding for goods should be provided.
--Fittings. No glass cases woidd be required, except for a few objects that

needed to be kept dry by lime. There would be little dust in a wooded country,

without any internal heating, and with air all filtered on passing in. Where glass

was desirable, large loose sheets could be laid over boxes or shelves ; cost about a

tenth of the price of the cheapest cases. Thus specimens could be put out of

--reach by having strips screwed down to secure the glass.
     Registeation. Perhaps a system of photogi'aphic registration would be

cheapest, as it would be worked on large groups of objects, continuously in a fi.xed

place and in routine. Such register photographs should be to one of two or three

de6nite scales ; and they should be sold, thereby helpingthe cost of the registration.
-- AConstitution.
                     body of Trustees would be supreme. One possible system
--would be for one Trustee to be nominated by each of the following persons : The

Principal Librarian of the British Museum, the Director of the Natural History

Museum, the Director of the South Kensington Museum, the Presidents of the

British Association, the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries, and the

Anthropological Listitute. Such nominees to hold office for seven years each,

retiring in rotation, but capable of re-nomination. Active men with sufficient

time to attend to the work might thus be obtained to represent the various interests

involved.

     The Keeper should be solely an administrator and organiser, and not a specialist

--in any line.
    Acquisitions. Any object might be refused bj- tlie Keeper, subject to an

appeal to the Trustees.

     Objects might be deposited by any public body or private person, the legality

of their removal to the Repository being provided in the constituting Act.
     All objects deposited for over thirty years, without claim and re-deposit,

should become the property of the Trust.

    Unless depositors make conditions, any duplicates may be lent to any public

museum by the Keeper, sanctioned by the Trustees.
    No responsibility will attach to the Trustees for the safety or condition of any

object deposited.

    Presented objects may be kept together in any system required by the donor

for thirty years.

     Objects found together, or required to illustrate each other, shall be perma-

nently inseparable.

   --Cost. Tlie site would continue to be productive except where actually built

over. For every 100 bays, or 1,600 feet of gallery, a clearance 75 feet wide would
be needed, or an area of 2f acres. Capital value (say) 100/. The estimate for the
gallery is 200/. per bay of 16 feet length, or for 1,600 feet 20,000/. For cottage
and ends (say) .500/.

     For comparison it may be stated that the whole exhibition floor-area of the
British Museum for antiquities and ethnology is about equal to 3,200 feet length
of such galleries, or two galleries such as above described, which would cost about

42,000/.

    Thus the exhibiting space of the British Museum might be reduplicated

at a prime cost equal to three or four months' maintenance of the existing
Museum.

     If the repository were started with one gallery, equal to half the British

Museum exhibiting area, and if a full allowance of ground were secured for future

expansion, the cost might be estimated as follows :

500 acres at (say) £40                           Prime          Cost per

for a building equal to half the British Museum exhibiting area, and the

securing of space for future building up to 50 or 100 times the present ex-

hibiting area. This amounts to 1^ per cent, on the present annual grant of the

British Museum at Bloomsbury.

      The foregoing memorandum was submitted for criticism by the Committee of
 the Council to several distinguished men of science, and the remarks received in
 reply show what points of the scheme should be discussed more fuUy and modified
 and what points need further explanation. I therefore beg to suggest the follow-
 ing amendments and additions to the memorandum :

      The scope in one opinion should be restricted to anthropology. As the utility
. of such space for other subjects was only hinted at, and does not enter into the
 proposals, this limitation may be accepted without altering any point.

      Inform the use of such long low galleries is said to be 'simply impossible, on
 account of its extreme ugliness.' As part of the original proposal is to entirely
 screen the buildings with trees outside, and divide them by stands and cases
 inside, the resthetic consideration need hardly compel extra expense, for the
 building would not be seen.

     Another proposal is to add a second story or provide for such. As the extra

 budding work would be more than double the proposed, and the added floor equal
 in cost to a roof, there would only be saved the value of land and a concrete floor.
 Against this the lighting would be so bad in a low wide gallery with only side
 windows that the space gained would be worth far less than if all were top-
 lighted. As the essence of the scheme is cheap space, there does not seem to be
much gained by a second story.

      In the question of fire, insurance is stated by one authority to be essential.

 If, however, there be nothing inflammable in the construction (for the building

 itself may be absolutely incombustible), and if there is only the risk of detached

 stands and cases being set on fire, the risk is so very minute that even if insured

Athe cost would be only nominal.  system of dividing the groups of cases into

hays by brick and slate shelvings at intervals would still further reduce any

possibility of combustion.

fiegHTdingJittinffs, one opinion is that glass cases to protect smaller specimens

would be necessary. It was already proposed to cover such things by large

sheets of glass screwed down ; and such covering would be effective, and cost
little more than the glass at Sd. a square foot. Where a permanent fitted case

was rex[uired such can be thoroughly well made and finished at Is. 4d. a cubic
foot. The amount already provided in the estimate for shelving and glass would

allow of adding 3,000 cubic feet of glass cases yearly if such were required.

Another opinion is that dust would be so serious that a great part of the

things 'must be placed in good cases.' It is already proposed to filter all the air

passing into the building, which would be quite practicable in a place where no

crowds would assemble and but little change of air was wanted. And the use of
sheets of glass laid over boxes and shelves may be made quite as dust-tight as the
best made cases if a line of cotton wool be laid to bed the glass upon. It must

be considered that the conditions of exhibiting would be very different from those

in a crowded city museum.

Regarding registration, tlie difficulty and time involved in photographic regis-

tration seems to be overestimated by those only accustomed to the tedious work

of arranging objects on a screen in an ordinary room. By having two fixed scales

of reduction (say ^ and ^x\) the need of focussing and time required for that

would be abolished, for with the rapid plates now used a very small stop is

enough, and differences due to thickness of objects would entirely disappear. The

proposal is to have a glass table (say), 80 x 100 inches, with white ground below,

on which to lay out objects for j\f scale, avoiding all the delay of fi.xing on
screens and all the shadows ; a second glass shelf (say), 16 x 20 inches, at a high

level for small things on h scale, the camera fi.ied looking down vertically on the
tables, and two slides for plates according to which table was in use. This

would give suitable scales on whole plate size. The lighting' should be quickly

adjustable by strips of blind round three sides of the room. With such a routine
arrangement a man at labourer's wages would be quite capable of working it for

all ordinary instances.

In the matter of constitution two opinions arc that such a repository should

belong to one definite existing museum only. This would be very well for that
one museum ; but there are many museums which require such an addition ; and
it would tie down what is essentially required to be a very elastic and experi-

mental institution to the existing routine of one body whose ideas are all based on

a very different order of things. To expect any one body with the traditions and

system which are requisite for a very different institution to adopt and work

flexibly in an entirely changed set of conditions is hardly promising. The reason

for hinting at a combined representation of many bodies on the management is

that no one set of traditions would prevail, and an energetic Keeper might have a

chance of a free policy. In any case the constitution is by no means an essential

matter, and I merely express the difficulty that I see in keeping new wine in old

skins.

On the subject of allowing a donor the privilege of making conditions about his

donations for (say) thirty years, one opinion is that no such conditions should be

allowed That is purely a matter of experience, and of no essential importance.

If people will give tilings as freely when they are not allowed any voice as to their

disposal times have changed. The past history has been that too many collections
have heen boinid by a name, not for thirty years only, but far longer.

     On the very important question of site two opinions are against the requisite

cheap land being within half an hour of London. It is very probable that it might
be rt^quisite to go further out, an hour from London. The speed varies much on

different lines, any line east of Aldershot being much slower than others. The
half-hiur from London by good trains reaches to Harold Wood, Hatfield, Watford,

Slough, and Aldershot. The hour circle touches Witham, Hitchin, Leighton,

Eeading, and nearly Basingstoke ; that is, half Essex, most of Hertfordshire, half

BuckiDghamsbire, part of Berks, and Hants. If land were to be purcbased withiii

this distance it seems that some reasonably cheap part might be found. But as

we can aiford to wait for opportunities, if the scheme be otiierwise well formulated,

it seems not chimerical to hope f >r the chance of an appropriation of open land for

such a public purpose out of some of the numerous downs, commons, and heaths

within the hour's distance.

There remain some other questions that have been raised outside of the memo-

randum:

1. That the plan is impracticable for want of funds. The amount suggested is

2,500/. a year. Supposing even that this was doubled, that would be 5,000/. a

year. Now the British Museum alone has increased its budget by 100,000/. per

annum within fifty or sixty years. Is, then, an increase of 5,000/. more not to be

thought of for twenty or thirty years to come? Or, looking at capital expense,

the cost of the small increase of room in the White Wing and Mausoleum Room

has been much more than the capital cost of a space equal to half the museum.
It may be safely said that long before we can hope to see this economical system in
working order the British Museum biidget will have increased by many times the
amount required for this.

2. The cost of packing and carriage of things from existing institutions would

of course be met by those places which had the benefit of the relief of valuable

space. For other cases of private donation 10 per cent, extra on the estimate would

probably quite provide. In any case this cannot make the scheme unworkable.

3. The proposal to avoid acquiring things that are not worth the most expen-

sive accommodation in the city museums is fatal to scientific study. And equally

fatal would be the idea of leaving all preservation to local museums, for the main

--purpose of this is not local English, but mankind in general the colonies and
--other lands as no student could be expected to visit Dakota, Brazil, Uganda, and

Mongolia to collect the information he might need, even if there was a uniform

appreciation in every country of the desirability of preserving history.

WeThe broad view remains untouched by all these minor details.            cannot at

present preserve large quantities of irreplaceable antiquities and ethnographic

specimens, owing to the existing costliness of museum accommodation, and which
come from countries where no local museums are possible. By the time every

country came up to the level of England in local museums there would be nothing

left to preserve. And yet, making every allowance for the unexpected, and even

tripling all the presumed costs, a space equal to the whole British Museum can be

provided for less than the average increase in Government grants for museums

-- --during four or five years. So that if this repository should not be realised in less

than twenty years hence as I quite expect the cost of it will have been spent

many times over in increased grants, which will only provide an invisible fraction

of the space that might thus be had.

     It is not proposed as an additional expense, but as a vastly more economical
mode of spending the normal increase which is always being made on the existing

--lines. The real question is not whether money can be found money is certain to

be found during the next twenty years for fresh museum space. The real question

is whether we shall have a small increase in our present London museums which

cripple our study, or a great increase in another form which shall give a new life

altogether to our study of man.

    2. The Duk Diik and other Customs as Forms of Expression of the
         Intellectual Life of the Melanesians. By Graf von Pfeil.

    The European who has a sufficiently prolonged experience of the natives of the

Bisniarck Archipelago is particularly struck by their very apparent desire towards
physical and psychical seclusion. Left to themselves, the natives confine their
intercourse to members of their own village and at most to those of immediately

neighbouring villages. The fact is that twenty years' intercourse with White Men

has failed to win tbe natives to any of the ways of civilisation ; they care more for

the tobacco brought by the White Man than for anything else he brings them.

                                                                                  3p2

The natives hate the foreigners, and distrust even their fellow-countrymen. This
seclusive disposition is taken as a key -with which to open, to some extent at least,

the mysteries with which the Melanesian loves to surround his actions.

   A lengthly description of the Duk Duk is not given, as it is fairly well known.

It is here viewed psychologically. The ceremony apparently serves two purposes

--(a) The first is to propitiate evil-disposed spirits and there is no doubt that this

part still represents some of the original traits of worship of the departed. It is,
however, next to impossible to gain sufficient insight into the ceremony to establish
a plausible theory, (b) The other purpose is a very materialistic one, as it is

nothing but a clever system of levying black-mail from the women who may not
lie, and from the men who are not, members of the Duk Duk.

     The Eineth ceremony is celebrated at irregular intervals. Within a dense
hedge square huts are built, on the white clay plaster of which curious figures of

birds, crocodiles, &c., are painted. On surrounding trees other figures, such as

snakes, the eting-ray, &c., are drawn, and two shapeless figures, which are

stated to be the spirits of deceased people. Only members of the Duk Duk can
enter the enclosure. Amongst other ceremonies observed is that of placing a

' tambu ' on certain articles of food as well as on certain actions and words.

During this period of tambu the participators meet at intervals and perform simple

dances.

AThe Marawot is celebrated only at very long intervals.  platform, 15 feet

square and 50 to 60 feet high, is erected, and entirely covered with leaves ; on this
a sort of war dance is held. The meaning of this was not discovered.

  -- --It is important nay more, it is necessary to clear up all the affected mysti-

cism connected with the Duk Duk and the customs related to it before it is too

late. The people themselves are forgetting their customs, because the Europeans,
to whose trading interests they form an impediment, sneer them into derision, and

the Duk Duk begins to retire into remoter parts. It is only through the study

of the habits of people who, like the Kanakas, still live in a primeval state, that

the development and history of our own race can ever be thoroughly understood.

         3. An Ancient British Interment. By F. T. Elworthy.

     The author exhibited photographs of an ancient British interment discovered on
August 29, 1896, by men in quarrying on the top of Culbone Hill, Somersetshire,
close to the road from Porlock to Lynton. The kist is still in situ, but will have
to be removed as the quarry advances. It is at about 5 feet from the surface of
the soil ; there is no appearance of there ever having been a cairn or barrow above
it. The direction of the grave is due north and south, it measures 3 feet 6 inches
long by 1 foot 10 inches by 1 foot 6 inches high. It is constructed with four upright
slabs of light-blue Devonian slate, of which plenty is to be found eight or nine
miles off", but it is totally different from the Old Red Sandstone immediately
beneath the interment.

      In the kist were found a very perfect skull, together with several bones of the
skeleton, of which photographs in three positions were shown. Alongside the
skull at the north end of the kist was found an urn of very early pottery, measur-
ing 6| in. high x 5 in. diam. There were no weapons or other objects found.

     The find was on the property of Earl Lovelace, and it is hoped that on his
return from abroad he will grant the request of the County Society, that the entire
interment may be placed in their Museum at Taunton.

     Some sketches in oil by Mr. Whyte Holdich showing the general surroundings

were also e^ibited.
     The interment was pronounced by Dr. Montelius, Mr. Coffey, Dr. Munro, Sir

John Evans and the President, to be certainly of the early Bronze Age, not later
 than the second millenium, B.C.

         4. On the Aboriginal Stick and Bone Writing of Australia.
                           By Dr. George Harley, F.R.S.

     The Australian aborigines use a script of straight incised lines or notches, which

resemble Ogam characters, except that they are written without a stem line.

They are arranged in groups, across a perpendicular column, sometimes on one
side, sometimes on the other, and occasionally across the centre. Sometimes the
perpendicular columns are two or more in number. Different sizes of characters
are used in the same communication ; and an emphatic form occurs with longer
lines, more widely spaced. Inscriptions on bone are found in Australia, as in

Ireland, in the Ogam script ; and the Australians, like the old Scandinavians, tie
hair, human or other, to their letters.

     Similar straight line scripts are found among the Giles in Central America, and
among the Samoyeds, and are all written in the same way. The question
remains open whether these are independent inventions, or derived from a common

source.

     The President delivered the following Address on Monday, September 21.

When I received the honour of an invitation to preside at the Physiological

Section of the British Association, my thoughts naturally turned to the subject of
the Presidential Address, and it seemed to me that the traditions of the British

Association, as vrell as the fact that a Physiological Section was a comparatively
new thing, both pointed to the choice of a subject of general biological interest
rather than a special physiological topic ; and I was the more encouraged to choose
such a subject because I look upon the growing separation of physiology from
morphology as a serious evil, and detrimental to both scientific subjects. I was
further encouraged to do so by the thought that, after all, a large amount of the

--work done in physiological laboratories is anatomical either mmute anatomy or

topographical anatomy, such as the tracing out of the course of nerve-libre tracts
in the central and peripheral nervous system by physiological methods. Such
methods require to be supplemented by the morphological method of inquiry. If

we can trace up step by step the increasing complexity of the vertebrate central
nervous system ; if we can unravel its complex nature, and determine the original

simpler paths of its conducting fibres, and the original constitution of the special
nerve centres, then it is clear that the method of comparative anatomy would be
of immense assistance to the study of the physiology of the central nervous sj-stem
of the higher vertebrates. So also with numbers of other physiological problems,
such as, for instance, the question whether all muscular substances are supplied
with inhibitory as well as motor nerves ; to which is closely allied the question of
the nature of the mechanism by which antagonistic muscles work harmoniously
together. Such questions receive their explanation in the researches of Biedermann
on the nerves of the opening and closing muscles of the claw of the crayfish, as
soon as it has been shown that a genetic relationship exists between the nervous
system and muscles of the crayfish and those of the vertebrate.

     Take another question of great interest in the present day, viz. the function
of such ductless glands as the thyi-oid and the pituitary glands. The explanation
of such function must depend upon the original function of these glands, and
cannot, therefore, be satisfactory until it has been shown by the study of compara-

tive anatomy how these glands have arisen. The nature of the leucocytes of the
blood and lymph spaces, the chemical problems involved in the assigning of carti-
lage into its proper group of mucin compounds, and a number of other questions
of physiological chemistry, will all advance a step nearer solution as soon as we
definitely know from what group of invertebrates the vertebrate has arisen.

    I have therefore determined to choose as the subject of my address 'The
                                                                             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                                 94§

Origin of Vertebrates,' feeling sure that the evidence which has appealed to me as

a physiologist will be of interest to the Physiological Section ; while at the same

time, as I have invited also the Sections of Zoology and Anthropology to be

present, I request that this address may be considered as opening a discussion on

the subject of the origin of vertebrates. I do not desire to speak e.v cathedra,

and to suppress discussion, but, on the contrary, I desire to have the matter

threshed out to its uttermost limit, so that if I am labouring under a delusion the
nature of that delusion may be clearly pointed out to me.

    The central pivot on which the whole of my theory turns is the central nervous

system, especially the brain region. There is the ego of each animal ; there is the

mymaster-organ, to which all the other parts of the body are subservient. It is to

mind inconceivable to imagine any upward evolution to be associated with a

degradation of the brain portion of the nervous system. The striking factor of
the ascent within the vertebrate phylum from the lowest fish to man is the steady

increase of the size of the central nervous system, especially of the brain region.

However much other parts may suffer change or degradation, the brain remains

intact, steadily increasing in power and complexity. If we turn to the inverte-
brate kingdom, we find the same necessary law : when the metamorphosis of ao
insect takes place, when the larval organs are broken up by a process of histolysis,
and new ones formed, the central nervous system remains essentially intact, and

the brain of the imago differs from that of the larva only in its increased growth

and complexity.

   A striking instance of the same necessary law is seen in the case of the

transformation of the larval lamprey, or Ammocoetes, into the adult lamprey, or

Petromyzon                                                             here  also, by a process of  histolysis,  most of the organs of  tbe head
                                                                    ;

region of the animal undergo dissolution and re-formation, while the brain remains

intact, increasing in size by the addition of new elements, without any sign of
preliminary dissolution. On the other hand, when, as is the case in the Tunicates,

the transformation process is accompanied with a degradation of the central nervous

system, we find the adult animal so hopelessly degraded that it is impossible to

imagine any upward evolution from such a type.

    It is to my mind perfectly clear that, in searching among the Invertebrata for

the immediate ancestor of the Vertebrata, the most important condition which such

ancestor must fulfil is to possess a central nervous system, the anterior part of

which is closely comparable with the brain region of the lowest vertebrate. It is

also clear on every principle of evolution that such hypothetical ancestor must
resemble the lowest vertebrate much more closely than any of the higher vertebrates,

and therefore a complete study of the lowest true vertebrate must give the best

chance of discovering the homologous parts of the vertebrate and the invertebrate.

For this purpose I have chosen for study the Ammocoetes, or larval form of the

lamprey, rather than Amphioxus or the Tunicates, for several reasons.

in the first place, all the different organs and parts of the higher vertebrates

can be traced directly into the corresponding parts of Petromyzon, and therefore of

--Ammocoetes. Thus, every part of the brain and organs of special sense all the

cranial nerves, the cranial skeleton, the muscular system, &c., of the higher

vertebrates can all be traced directly into the corresponding parts of the lamprey.

So direct a comparison cannot be made in the case of Amphioxus or the

Tunicates.

     Secondly, Petromyzon, together with its larval form, Ammocoetes, constitutes an

ideal animal for the tracing of the vertebrate ancestry, in that in Ammocoetes we

have the most favourable condition for such investigations, \'iz. a prolonged larval

stage, followed by a metamorphosis, and the consequent production of the imago or

--Petromyzon a transformation which does not, as in the case of the Tunicates, lead

to a degenerate condition, but, on the contrary, leads to an animal of a distinctly

higher vertebrate type than the Ammocoetes form. As we shall see, the Ammo-

coetes is 80 full of invertebrate characteristics that we can compare organ for

organ, structure for structure, with the corresponding parts of Limulus and its
allies. Then comes that marvellous transformation scene duruig which, by 9.

process of histolysis, almost all the invertebrate characteristics are destroyed or

changed, and there emerges a higher animal, the Petromyzon, which can now be

compared organ lor organ, structure for structure, with the larval form of the

Amphibian ; and so through the medium of these larval forms we can trace upwards

without a break the evolution of the vertebrate from the ancient king-crab form.

On the other hand, Amphioxus and the Tunicates are distinctly degenerate ; it is

easier to look upon either of them as a degenerate Ammoccete than as giving a

clue to the ancestor of the Ammoccete. It is to my mind surprising how difficult

it appears to be to get rid of preconceived opinions, for one still hears, in the

assertion that Petromyzon as well as Amphioxus is degenerate, the echoes of the
ancient myth that the Elasmobranchs are the lowest fishes, and the Cyclostomata

their degenerated descendants.

     The characteristic of the vertebrate central nervous system is its tubular
character ; and it is this very fact of its formation as a tube which has led to the
disguising of its segmental character, and to the whole difficulty of connecting
vertebrates with other gi-oups of animals. The explanation of the tubular

character of the central nervous system is the keystone to the whole of my theory

of the origin of vertebrates. The explanation which I have given differs from aU

--others, in that I consider the nervous system to be composed of two parts an

internal epithelial tube, surrounded to a greater or less extent by a segmented
nervous system ; and I explain tlie existence of these two parts by the hypothesis
that the internal epithelial tube was originally the alimentary canal of an
arthropod animal, such as Limulus or Eurypterus, which has become surrounded
to a greater or less extent by the nervous system.

    Any hypothesis which deals with the origin of one group of animals from

another must satisfy three conditions :
     1. It must be in accordance with the phylogeuetic history of each group. It

must therefore give a consistent explanation of all the organs and tissues of the
higher group which can be clearly shown not to have originated within the group
itself. At the same time, the variations which have occurred on the hypothesis
must be in harmony with the direction of variation in the lower group, if not
actujilly foreshadowed in that group.

    This condition may be called the Phylogeuetic test.
     2. The anatomical relation of parts must be the same in the two groups, not

only with respect to coincidence of topographical an-angement, but also with
respect to similarity of structure, and, to a large extent, also of function.

    This condition may be called the Anatomical test.
     3. The peculiarities of the ontogeny or embryological development of the higher

group must receive an adequate explanation by means of the hypothesis, while at
the same time they must help to illustrate the truth of the hypothesis.

     This condition may be called the Ontogenetic test.

    myI hope to convince you that all these three conditions are satisfied by

hypothesis as far as the head region of the vertebrate is concerned. I speak only
of the head region at present, because that is the part which I have especially
studied up to the present time, and also because it is natural and convenient to
consider the cranial and spinal nerves separately ; and I hope to demonstrate to you
that not only the nervous system and alimentary canal of such a group of animals

--as the Gigantostraca i.e. Limulus and its allied foi-ms is to be found in the head

region of Ammoccetes, but also, as must logically follow, that every part of the
head region of Ammoccetes has its homologous part in the prosomatic and
mesosomatic regions of Limulus and its allies. I hope to convince you that our
brain is hollow because it has grown round the old cephalic stomach ; that our
skeleton arose from the modifications of chitinous ingrowths ; that the nerves of

--the medulla oblongata i.e. the facial, glosso-pharyngeal, and vagus nerves arose

from the mesosomatic nerves to the branchial and opercular appendages of
Limulus, while the nerves of the hind brain are derived from the nerves of the
prosomatic region of Limulus ; that our cerebral hemispheres are but modifications
of the supra-oesophageal ganglia of a scorpion, while our eyes and nose are the
direct descendants of its eyes and olfactory organs.

     In the first place, I will give you shortly the reasons why the central nervous

nervous system and alimentary canal of an arthropod.

Comparison of the Central Nervous System of Ammocoetes with the
     Conjoined Central Nervous System and Alimentary Canal of an
     Arthropod Animal such as Limnlus.

     1. The phylogenetic test proves that the tube of the central nervous system was
originally an epithelial tube, sun-ounded to a certain extent by nerv'ous material.

     The anatomical test then proves that this epithelial tube corresponds in its

topographical relations to the nervous material exactly with the alimentary canal
of an arthropod in its relations to the central nervous system ; and, further, that the
topographical relations, structure, and function of the corresponding parts of this
nervous material are identical in the Ammocoetes and in the arthropod.

   We see from these diagi-ams, taken from Edinger, how the greater simplicity of

the brain region as we descend the vertebrate phylum is attained by the reduction

of the nervous material more and more to the ventral side of the central tube, with
the result that the dorsal side becomes more and more epithelial, until at last, as is
seen in Ammocoetes, the roof of the epichordal portion of the brain consists
entirely of fold upon fold of a simple epithehal membrane, interrupted only in one
place by the crossing of the IVth nerve and commencement of the cerebellum.
In the prechordal part of the brain this simple epithelial portion of the tube ia
continued on in the middle hne as the first choroid plexus of Ahlborn, and the
lamina terminalis round to the ventral side ; where, again, in the infundibular

region, the epithelial saccus vasculosus, which has been becoming more and mora

conspicuous iii the lower vertebrates, together with the median tube of the^
infundibulum, testifies to the withdrawal of the nervous material from this part of

the brain, as well as from the dorsal region. Further, as already mentioned in my

previous papers, the invasion of this epithelial tube by nervous material during the
upward development of the vertebrate is beautifully shown by the commencing
development of the cerebellar hemispheres in the doghsh ; by the dorsal growth of
nervous material to form the optic lobes in the Petromyzon ; by the occlusion of
the ventral part of the tube in the epicbordal region to iorm the raph(5, as seen in its
fommencement in Ammocoetes. Finally, evidence of another kind in favour of
the tubular formation being due to an original non-nervous epithelial tube is given
by the frequent occurrence of cystic tumours, and also by the formation of the

sinus rhomboidalis in birds.

     The phylogenetic history of the brain of vertebrates, in fact, is in complete
Larmony with the theory that the tubular nervous system of the vertebrate

--originally consisted of two parts viz. an epithelial tube and a nervous system

outside that tube, which has grown over it more and more, and gives not only no
support whatever, but is in direct opposition, to the view that the whole tube was
originally nervous, and that the epithelial portions, such as the choroid plexuses
and roof of the fourth ventricle, are thinned-down portions of that nerve tube.

Passing now to
    2. The anatmnical test, we see immediately why this epithelial tube comes out

so much more prominently in the lowest vertebrates, for, as can be seen from the

diagrams, and is more fully pointed out in my previous papers,^ every part of the

central tube of the vertebrate nervous system corresponds absolutely, both in
position and structure, with the corresponding part of the alimentary canal of the

arthropod, and the nervous material which is arranged round this epithelial tube
is identically the same in topographical position, in structure, and in function as

the corresponding parts of the central nervous system of an arthropod.
     Especially noteworthy is it to tind that the pineal eye (PN), with its large

optic ganglion, the ganglion habenulse (GHR), falls into its right and appropriate
place as the right median eye of such an animal as Limulus or Eurypterus. In

the following table I will shortly group together the evidence of the anatomical

            B. Coincidence of Structure and Physiological Function.

      1. TTie simple non-glandular epithelium of the nerve tube coincides with the
simple non-glandular epithelium of the alimentary canal, ciliated as it is in

Daphnia.'

     2. The structure and function of the cerebral hemispheres, olfactory lobes, and

optic ganglia closely resemble the corresponding parts of the supra-cesophageal

ganglia.

     3. The structure of the right pineal eye, with its nerve end-cells and rhabdites,
is of the same nature as that of a median arthropod eye.

     4. The structure of the right ganglion habenulae is the same as that of the
optic ganglion of the median eye.

     5. The region of the hind brain, like the region of the infra-cesophageal ganglia,
is concerned with the co-ordination of movements.

     6. The region of the medulla oblongata, like the mesosomatic region of
Limulus and its allies, is concerned especially with the movements of respiration.

     7. The centres for the segmental cranial nerves resemble closely in their
groups of motor cells and plexus substance the centres for the prosomatic and
mesosomatic nerves, with their groups of motor cells and reticulated substance

(Tunkt-Substanz).

3. The third test is the ontoyenetic test. The theory must be in harmony with,

and be illustrated by, the embryonic development of the central nervous system.

Such is the case, for we see that the nerve tube arises as a simple straight tube

opening by the neurenteric canal into the anus, the anterior part of the tube, i.e.

the cephalic stomach region, being remarkably dilated ; the anterior opening of this

tube, or anterior neuropore, is considered by most authors to have been situated in

the infundibular region.

Next comes the formation of the cerebral vesicles, indicating embryologically

the constricting- growth of nervous material outside the cephalic stomach. First,

the formation of two cerebral vesicles by the growth of nervous material in the

position of the ganglia habenulae, posterior commissure, and Meynert's bimdle, i.e.

the constricting influence of commissures between the optic part of the supra-ceso-

phageal ganglia and the infra-oesopbageal ganglia ; then the formation of the third

cerebral vesicle by the constricting influence of the IVth nerve and commencing

cerebellum. Subsequently the first cerebral vesicle is divided into two parts by

--another nerve commissure the anterior commissure, i.e. by nerve material joining

the supra-cesophageal gangha. Further, the embryological evidence shows that in

the spinal cord region the nerve masses are at first most conspicuous veutrally and

laterally to the original tube, such ventral masses being early connected together

with the strands of  the anterior commissure                                                                                              ultimately, by the growth of nervous
                                                                                                                                       ;

material dorsalwards, the dorsal portion of the tube is compressed to form the

posterior fissure and the substantia Rolandi, the original large lumen of the old

intestine being thus reduced to the small central canal of the adult nervous system.

Finally, this nerve tube is formed at a remarkably early stage, just as ought to be

the case ii' it represented an ancient alimentary canal.

The ontogenetic test appears to fail in two points :

     1. That the nerve tube of vertebrates is an epiblastic tube, whereas if it repre-
sented the old invertebrate gut it ought to be largely hypoblastic.

     2. The nerve tube of vertebrates is formed from the dorsal surface of the
embryo, while the central nervous system of arthropods is formed from the

ventral surface.

    With respect to the first objection, it might be argued, with a good deal of
plausibility, that the term hypoblast is used to denote that surface which is known
by its later development to form the alimentary canal ; that in fact, as Ileymons *

has pointed out, the theory of the germinal layers is not sufiiciently well esta-
blished to give it any phylogenetic value. It is, however, unnecessary to discuss

   this question, seeing that Heymons has shown that the whole alimentary tract in

such arthropods as the earwig, cockroach, and mole cricket, is, like the nerve tube

of vertebrates, formed from epiblast.

    The second objection appears to me more apparent than real. The nerve layer,

in the vertebrate, as soon as it can be distinguished, is always found to lie ventrally

to the layer of epiblast which forms the central canal. In the middle line of the

body, owing to the absence of the mesoblast layer, the cells which form the noto-

chord and those which form the central nei'vous system form a mass of cells which

cannot be separated in the earlier stages. The nerve layer in the arthropod lies

between the ventral epiblast and the gut ; the nerve layer in the vertebrate lies

between the so-called hypoblast (i.e. the ventral epiblast of the arthropod) and

the neural canal (i.e. the old gut of the arthropod). The new ventral surface of

the vertebrate in the head region is not formed until the head fold is completed.

Before this time, when we watch the vertebrate embryo lying on the yolk, with its

nervous system, central canal, and lateral plates of mesoblast, we are watching the

embryonic representation of the original Limulus-like animal ; then, when the
lateral plates of mesoblast have grown round, and met in the middle line to assist
in forming the new ventral surface, and the head fold is completed, we are watching

the embryonic representation of the transformation of the Limulus-like animal into

the scorpion-like ancestor of the vertebrates.

     In the Arthropoda, the simple epithelial tube which forms the stomach and

intestine is not a glandular organ, and we find that the digestive part of the ali-

mentary tract is found in the large organ, the so-called liver. This organ, together

with the generative glands, forms an enormous mass of glandular substance, which,

iu Limulus, is tightly packed roimd the whole of the central nervous system and

alimentary canal, along the whole length of the animal (represented iu fig. 4 by
the dark dotted substance). The remains of this glandular mass are seen in

Ammocoetes in the peculiar so-called packing tissue around the brain and spinal

cord (represented in fig. 6 by the dark dotted substance). It satisfies the three

tests to the following extent :

   --1. The p/a/ioffenetic test. As we descend the vertebrate phylum, we find that

the brain fills up the brain-case to a less and less extent, until finally in Ammocoetes

a considerable space is left between brain and brain-case, filled up with a peculiar

glandular-looking material, interspersed with pigment, which is not fat tissue, and
is most marked in the lowest vertebrates. Tlie natural interpretation of this

phylogenetic history is that the cranial cavity is too large for the brain in the

lowest vertebrates, and is fiUed up with a peculiar glandular substance because

that glandular substance pre-existed as a functional organ or organs, and not
because it was necessary to surround the brain with packing material in order to

keep it steady, owing to the unfortunate mistake having been made of forming a
brain much too small for its case.

     2. The anatomical test shows that this glandular and pigmented material is in
the same position with respect to the central nervous system of Ammocoetes as the
generative and liver material with respect to the central nervous system and

alimentary canal of Limulus.

   3. T/ie ontoffenetic test remains to be worked out. I do not know the orgin of

this tissue in Ammocoetes                                                                                                     the evidence has not yet been given by  Kuppfer.^  He
                                                                                                                           ;

has, however, shown that the neural ridge gives origin to a mass of mesoblastic

cells, the further fate of which is not worked out. Tlie whole story is very sugges-

tive from the point of view of my theory, but incomprehensible on the view that

the neural ridge is altogether nervous.

    Finally, we ought to find in the invertebrate group in question indica-
tions of the commencement of the enclosure of the alimentary canal by the

central nervous system; such is, in fact, the case. In the scorpion group a
marked process of cephalisation has gone on, so that the separate ganglia,

both of the prosomatic and mesosomatic region, have fused together, and fused

also with the large supra-oesophageal mass. In the middle of tins large braiu
mass a small canal is seen closely surrounded and compressed with nervous
matter as is shown in this specimen of Thelyphonus ; this canal is the alimentary
canal. A^ain, Hardy, in his work on the nervous system of Crustacea, has sections
throuo-h the brain of Branchipus which demonstrate so close an attachment between
the nervous matter of the optic gangUon and the anterior diverticulum of the gut
that no line of demarcation is visible between the cells of the gut wall and the
cells of the optic ganglion.

      For all these reasons I consider that the tubular nature of the vertebrate

central nervous system is explained by my hypothesis much more satisfactorily

and fully than by any other as yet put forward ; it further follows that if tbis
hypothesis enables us to homologise all the other parts of the head region of the
vertebrate with similar parts in the arthropod, then it ceases to be an hypothesis,
but rises to the dignity of the most probable theory of the origin of vertebrates.

                               Origin of Segmental Cranial Nerves.

     1. The phylngenetic test.-- ll follows from the close resemblance of the brain
region of the central nervous systems in the two groups of animals that the cranial
nerves of the vertebrate must be homologous with the foremost nerves of such an
animal as Limulus, and must therefore supply homologous organs. Leaving out
of consideration for the present the nerves of special sense, it follows that the seg-
mental cranial nerves must be divisible into two groups corresponding to two sets
of segmental muscles, viz. a group supplying structures homologous to the appen-
dages of Limulus and its allies, and a group supplying the somatic or body muscles

in other words, we must find precisely what is the most marked characteristic of
the vertebrate cranial nerves, viz. that they are divisible into two sets correspond-
ing to a double segmentation in the head region. The one set, consisting of the
Vth, Vllth, IXth, and Xth nerves, supply the muscles of the branchial or

visceral segments ; the other set, consisting of the Ilird, IVth, Vltli, and Xllfch

nerves, the muscles of the somatic segments. Further, we see that the nerves

supplying the branchial segments, like the nerves supplying the appendages in
Limulus, are mixed motor and sensory, while the nerves supplying the somatic
segments are all purely motor, the corresponding sensory nerves running separately
as the ascending root of the fifth nerve ; so also in Limulus, the nerves supplying
the powerful body muscles arise separately from those supplying the appendages,
and also are quite separate from the purely sensory or epimeral (^Nlilne I'^dwards) '
nerves which supply the surfaces of the carapace in the prosomatic and mesoso-

matic regions. Finally, the researches of Hardy - have shown that the motor portion
of these appendage nerves, just like the nerves of the branchial segmentation in
vertebrates, i.e. the motor part of the trigeminal, of the facial, of the glosso-pharyugeal,
and of the vagus, arise from nerve centres or nuclei quite separate from those
which give origin to the motor nerves of the somatic muscles. The phylogenetic

history, then, of the cranial nerves points directly to the conclusion that the "Vth,

Vllth, IXth, and Xth nerves originally innervated structures of the nature of

arthropod appendages.

   We can, however, go further than this, for we find, as we trace downwards

throughout the vertebrate kingdom the structures supplied by these nerves, that

they are divisible into two well-marked groups, especially well seen in Ammo-

coetes, viz. :

   A1. posterior group, viz. the Vllth, IXth, and Xth nerves, which arise

from the medulla oblongata and supply all the structures within a branchial

chamber.

    2. An anterior group, viz. the Vth nerves, which arise from the hind brain

and supply all the structures within an oral chamber.

    The reason for this grouping is seen wlien we turn to Limulus and its allies, for
·we find that the body is always divided into a prosoma and mesosoma, and that
the appendage nerves are divisible into two corresponding well-marked groups,

viz. :

    A1 . posterior or mesosomatic group, which arise from the mesosomatic ganglia

and supply the operculum and branchial appendages.

one hand into the alimentary canal, and on the other to the exterior. Such a

description is possible even as low down as Petromyzon, but when we pass to the

nature of the branchial chamher is seen in fig. 3, which demonstrates clearly

that the IXth and Xth nerves supply a series of separate gill-hearing struc-
tures or appendages, which hang freely into a common respiratory chamber;

each one of these appendages is moved by its own separate group of branchial

muscles, and possesses an external branchial bar of cartilage, which, by its

union with its fellows, contributes to form the extra-branchial basket-work so

characteristic of this primitive respiratory chamber. The segmental branchial unit

is clearly in this case, as Rathke originally pointed out, each one of these suspended

gills, or rather gill-bearing appendages ; it is absolutely unnatural, as Nestler *

attempts to do, to take a portion of the space between two consecutive gills and

mycall that a gill-pouch. It is, to  mind, one of the most extraordinary and con-

fusing conceptions of the current morphology to describe an animal in terms of

the spaces between organs, rather than in terms of the organs by which those

Wespaces are formed.  might as well speak of a net as a number of holes tied

together with string. Another most striking advantage is obtained by considering

--the segmental unit to be represented by each of these separate branchial append-

ages viz. that we can continue the series in the most natural manner (as seen in

fig. 3) in front of the limits of the IXth and Xth nerves, and so find a series

of appendages in the oral chamber serially homologous with the branchial append-

ages. The uppermost of the respiratory appendages is the hyo-braucbial, supplied

   by the Vlltli uerve, then, passing iuto the oral chamber, we find a series of non-

   branchial appends a:es, viz. the velar and tentacular appendages, supplied by branches
   of the Vth nerve. In fact, by simply considering the tissue between the so-called
   gill-pouches as the segmental unit, we no longer get lost in a maze of hypothetical

   gill-pouches in front of the branchial region, but find that the resemblances between
   the oral and branchial regions, which have led to the endless search for gill-slits
   and gill-pouches, really mean that the oral cliamber contains appendages j ust as
   the branchial chamber, but that the former were not gill-bearing.

   The study of Ammocoetes, then, leads directly to the conclusion that the ancestor

   of the vertebrate possessed an oral or prosomatic chamber, which contained a series
   of non-branchial, tactile and masticatory appendages, which were innervated from

   the fused prosomatic ganglia or hind brain, and a branchial or mesosomatic

   cliamber, which contained a series of branchial appendages which were innervated

   from the fused mesosomatic ganglia or medulla oblongata. These two chambers

   did not originally communicate with each other, for the embryological evidence
   shows that they are separated at firet by the septum of the stomatodseum, and

   also that the oral chamber is formed by the forward growth of the lower lip.

        The phylogenetic test on the side of Limulus and its congeners agrees in a
   remarkable manner with the conclusions derived from the study of Ammocoetes,
   for we see that the variation which has occurred in the formation of Eurypterus

   from Limulus is exactly of the kind necessary to form the oral and branchial

   chambers of the Ammocoetes. Thus, we find with respect to the mesosomatic

   appendages that the free, many-jointed appendages of the crustacean become con-

   verted into the plate-like appendages of Limulus, in which the separate joints are

   still visible, but insignificant in comparison with the large branchipe-bearing lamella
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

   then comes the in-sinking of these appendages, as described by Macleod,' to form the

   branchial lamellae, or so-called lung-books of Thelyphonus, and the branchis of
   Eurypterus, in which all semblance of jointed and free appendages disappears and

   the branchiae project into a series of chambers or gill-pouches, each pair of which

   in Thelyphonus open freely into communication. In this way we see already

   the commencement of the formation of a branchial chamber similar to that of
   Ammocoetes.

        So also with the innervation of these mesosomatic appendages, originally a series
   of separate mesosomatic ganglia, each of which innervates a separate appendao-e

   then a process of cephalisation takes place, in consequence of which, in the first

   place, a single ganglion, the opercular ganglion, fuses with the already fused proso-
   matic ganglia, as is seen in the stage of Limulus ; then, as pointed out by Lankester,

   in the difterent groups of scorpions more and more of the mesosomatic ganglia fuse

   together, and so we find the upward variation in this group is distinctly in the

   direction of the formation of the medulla oblongata coincidently with the formation

   of a branchial chamber.

   In a precisely similar way, we find the variation which has occurred in the

   prosomatic appendages leads directly to the formation of the oral chamber and oral

   appendages  of Ammocoetes                                                     for  the original  chelate and  locomotor  appendages of
                                                                              ;

   Limulus become converted into the tactile non-chelate appendages of Eurypterus

   {cf. figs. 4 and 5), and the small chilaria (M) of Limulus, according to Lankester,

   fuse in the middle line and grow forward to form the metastoma of Eurj-pterus,

   thus forming an oral chamber, into which the short tactile appendages could be

   withdrawn, closely similar in its formation to the oral chamber of Ammocoetes.

   The prosomatic ganglia supplying these oral appendages have already, in Limulus

   {see fig. 4), been fused together to form the iufra-oesophageal ganglia or hind brain.

   The phylogenetic test, then, both on the side of the vertebrate and of the inver-

   tebrate, points direct to the conclusion that the peculiarities of the trigeminal and
   vagus groups of nerves are due to their origin from nerves supplying prosomatic
   and mesosomatic appendages respectively.

        2. The anatomical test confirms and emphasises this conclusion in a most

   striking manner, for we find not only coincidence of topographical arrangement, as

already mentioned, but also similarity of structure ; thus we see that the blood in
the p;ill lamellre and velar appendages of Ammoccetes does not circulate in distinct
capillaries, but, as in the arthropod appendages, in lacunar spaces, which by the

subdivision of the surface of the appendage to form gill lamellae become narrow
channels ; that also certain of the branchial muscles and of the muscles of the velar
appendages are of the invertebrate type of so-called tubular muscles. These inver-
tebrate muscles are not found in higher vertebrates, but only in Ammoccetes, and
moreover disappear entirely at transformation.

                      Origin of the Vertebrate Cartilaginous Skeleton.

     Perhaps, however, the most startling evidence in favour of the homology
between the branchial segments of Ammoca^tes and the branchial appendages of
Limulus is found in the fact that a cartilaginous bar external to the brancbise
exists in each one of the branchial appendages of Limulus, to which some of the

branchial muscles are attached in precisely the same way as in Ammoccetes. The

branchial cartilages of Limulus (see fig. 4) spring from the entapophyses and form

strong cartilaginous bars which are extra-branchial in position, just as in Ammo-

ccetes, in addition to each branchial bar, a cartilaginous ligament passes from one
entapophysis to another, so as to form a longitudinal or entapophysial ligament,
more or less cartilaginous, which e.ytends on each side along the length of the

mesosoma. Tn precisely the same way the branchial bars of Ammoccetes are

joined together along each side of the notochord by a ligamentous band of more
or less continuous cartilaginous tissue, forming a subchordal or parachordal carti-

laginous ligament.

     Further, we see that this cartilage of Limulus is of a very striking structare,

quite different from that of vertebrate cartilage, and that it is formed in a fibro-
raassive tissue which, like the matrix of the cartilage, gives a deep purple stain
with thionin, thus showing the presence of some form of chondro-mucoid. This
fibro-massive tissue is closely connected with the chitinogenous cells of the entapo-

physes.

     Startling is it to find that the branchial cartilages of Ammoccetes possess
identically the same structure as the cartilages of Limulus ; that the branchial
cartilages are formed in a fibro-massive tissue which, like the matrix of tbe cartilage,
gives a deep purple stain with thionin, and that this fibro-massive tissue, to which
Schneider ^ gives the name of muco-cartilage, or ^'orknorpel, entirely disappears at

transformation

     Further, according to Shipley,- the cartilaginous skeleton of the Ammoccetes
when first formed consists simply of a series of straight branchial bars, springing
from a series of cartilaginous pieces arranged bilaterally along the notochord.

      The formation of the trabeculse, of the auditory capsules, of the crossbars to
form the branchial basket-work, all occur subsequently, so that exactly those parts
which alone exist in Limulus are those parts which alone exist at an early stage in
 Ammoccetes. Another distinction is manifest between these branchial cartilages
 and those of the trabeculse and auditory capsules, in that the latter do not stain in
 the same manner; whereas the matrix of the branchial cartilages stains red with
 picro-carmine, that of the trabeculje and auditory capsules stains deep yellow, so
 that the jimction between the trabeculse and the first branchial bar is well marked
by the transition from the one to the other kind of staining. The difference cor-
 responds to Parker's ' soft and hard cartilage.

     The new cartilages which are formed at transformation, either in places where

 muco-cartilage exists before or by the invasion of the fibrous tissue of the brain-
case by chondroblasts, are all of the hard cartilage variety.

vertebrate skeletou all show how the bony skeleton is formed from the cartilaginou.s,

and how the cartilaginous skeleton can be traced back to that found in Petromyzon,

and 80 to the still simpler form found in Ammoccetes ; from this, again, we can pass

directly to the cartilaginous skeleton of Limulus, and so finally trace back the

cranial skeleton of the vertebrate to its commencement in the modified chitinous

Aingrowths connected with the entapophyses of Limulus.                                         similar explanation of

the origin of cartilage from modifications of the chitinous ingrowths of Limulus

was suggested by Gegenbauer ' so long ago as 1858, in consideration of the near

chemical resemblances between the chitin and mucin groups of substances.

Comparison of the Thyroid and Hyo-hranchial Appendage of Ammocoetes
     loith the Opercular Appendage of Eurypterus, Thelyphonus, &c.
    Meaning of the Vllth Nerve.

mSeeing, then, how easily the IXth and Xth nerves Ammocoetes correspond

to the mesosomatic nerves to the branchial appendages in Limulus, and therefore

to the corresponding nerves in such an animal as Eurypterus, we may with con-

fidence proceed to the consideration of the Vllth nerve, and anticipate that it will

be found to innervate a mesosomatic appendage in front of the branchial appendages,

and yet belonging to the branchial group ; in other words, if the Vllth nerve is to

fit into the scheme, it ought to innervate a structure or structures corresponding

to the operculum of Limulus or of Thelyphonus, &c. Now we see in figs. 5 and 8

the nature of the operculum in Eurypterus and in Thelyphonus, Phrynus, &c. It is

in reality composed of two parts, a median and anterior portion which bears on its

under surface the external genital organs, and a posterior part which bears branchiae

so that the operculum of these animals may be considered as a genital operculum

fused to a branchial appendage, and therefore double. It is absolutely startling to

find that the branchial segment immediately in front of the glosso-pharyngeal seg-

ment in Ammocretes (fig. 3) consists of two parts, of which the posterior, the

hyo-branchial, is gill-bearing, while the anterior carries on its under surface the

pseudo-branchial groove of Dohrn, which continues as a ciliated groove up to the

opening of the thyroid gland.

Again, the comparison of the ventral surfaces of Eurypterus and Ammocoetes

(cf. fig. 8) brings to light a complete coincidence of position between the

median tongue of the operculum in the one animal and the median plate of muco-

cartilage in the other animal, which separates in so remarkable a manner the

cartilaginous basket-work of each side, and bears on its under surface the thyroid

gland. Finally, Miss Alcock has shown that not only the hyo-branchial, but also

the thyroid part of this segment, is innervated bj' the "S^IIth nerve ; so that every

argument which has forced us to the conclusion that the glosso-pharyngeal and

vagus nerves are the nerves which originally supplied branchial appendages equally

--points to the conclusion that the facial nerve originally supplied the opercular

appendage an appendage which closed the branchial chamber in front, which con-

sisted of two parts, a branchial and a genital, probably indicating the fusion of

two segments                                                       and that the thyroid gland belonged to the genital operculum, just as
                                                                ;

the branchiae belonged to the branchial operculum. This interpretation of the parts

supplied by the facial nerve immediately explains why Dohrn is so anxious to make

a thyroid segment in front of the branchial segments, and why a controversy is still

going on as to whether the facial supplies two segments or one.

"What, then, is the thyroid gland ? Of all the organs found in the vertebrate,

with perhaps the single exception of the pineal eye, there is no one which so

clearly is a relic of the invertebrate ancestor as the thyroid gland. This gland,

important as it is known to be in the higher vertebrates, remains of much the
same type of structure down to the fishes, and even to Petromyzon suddenly,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

when we pass to the Ammocoetes, to that larval condition so pregnant with inver-
tebrate surprises, we find that the thyroid has become a large and important organ,

totally different in structure from the thyroid of all other vertebrates, though
resembling the endostyl of the Tunicates.

    The thyroid of Ammoeoetes may be described as a long tube, cxirled up at its

posterior end, which contains in its wall, along the whole of its length, a peculiar
glandular structure, confined to a small portion of its wall.

   A section through this tube is given in fig. 7, and shows how this glandular

structure possesses no alveoli, no ducts, but consists of a column of elongated cells
arranged in a wedge-shaped manner, the apex of the wedge being in the lumen
of the tube ; each cell contains a spherical nucleus, situated at the very extreme

end of the cell, farthest away from the lumen of the tube. Such a structure is
different form that of any otlier vertebrate gland. Its secretion is not in any way
evident. It certainly does not secrete mucus or take part in digestion, and for a
long time I was unable to find any structure which resembled it in the least
degree, apart, of course, from the endostyl of the Tunicates.

     Guided, however, by the considerations already put forward, and feeling
therefore convinced tliat in Eurypterus there must have been a structure re-
sembling the thyroid gland underneath the median projection of the operculum,

I proceeded to investigate the nature of the terminal genital apparatus under-

lying the operculum in the different members of the scorpion family, and reproduce
here (tig. S) the figures given by Blanchard ' of the appearance of the terminal male
genital organs in Phrynus and Thelyphonus. Emboldened by the striking appear-
ance of these figures, I proceeded to cut sections through the operculum ot the
European scori)ion, and found that that part of the genital duct which underlies
the operculum, and that part only, contains within its walls a glandular structure

Awhich, resembles the thyroid glanci of Ammoeoetes in a remarkable degree. section

is represented in fig. 7, and we see that under the operculum in the middle line is

situated a tube, the walls of which in one part on each side are thickened by the
formation of a gland with long cells of the same kind as those of the thyroid ; the
nucleus is spherical, and situated at the farther end of the cell, and the cells are
arranged in wedges, so that the extremities of each group of cells come to a point
on the surface of the inner lining of the tube. This point is marked by a small
round opening in the internal chitinous lining of the tube. These cells form a
column along the whole length of the tube, just as in the thyroid gland, so that
the chitinous lining along that column is perforated by numbers of small round

holes. This glandular structure is not confined to the male scorpion, but is found
also in the female, though not so well developed.

      So characteristic is the structure, so different fi'om anything else, that I have no
hesitation in saying that the thyroid of Ammocoetes is the same structurally as the
thyroid of the scorpion, and that, therefore, in all probability the median projection
of the operculum in the old forms of scorpions, such as Eurypterus, Pterygotus,
Slimonia, &c., covered a glandular tube of the same nature as the thyroid of
Ammocoetes.

    We see, then, that the structures innervated by the Vllth, IXth, and Xth

nerves are absolutely concordant with the view that the primitive vertebrate
respiratory chamber was formed from the mesosomatic appendages of such a form
as Limulus by a slight modification of the method by which the respiratory
apparatus of Thelyphonus and other Arachnids has been formed, according to
Macleod. The anterior limit of this chamber was formed by the operculum, the
basal part of which formed a septum which originally separated the branchial from
the oral chamber.

  Coinparison of the Oral Chamber of Ammocoetes with that of Exwypterus.
                                  Meaning of the Vth Nerve.

   --Passing now to the oral chamber i.e. to the visceral structures innervated by

the Vth nerve we find, as already suggested, distinct evidence in Ammocoetes of

the presence of the modified prosomatic appendages of the original Eurypterus-
like form. The large velar appendage is the least modified, possessing as it does
the arthropod tubular muscles, a blood system of lacunar blood-spaces, and a
surface covered with a regiilar scale-like pattern, formed by cuticular nodosities,

similar to that found on the surface of Eurypterus and other scorpions. The
velar appendages show, fm-ther, that they are serially homologous with the re-
spiratory appendages, in that they have been utilised to assist in respiration, their
movements being synchronous with the respiratory movements.
--

    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.  9G1

      The separate part of the Vth nerve -which supplies the velar appendage passes
 within it from the dorsal to the ventral part of the animal, and then, as Miss
 Alcoek has shown, turns abruptly forward to supply the large median tentacle.
 This extraordinary course leads directly to the conclusion that this median
 tentacle, which is in reality double, constitutes, with the velum of each side, the

 true velar appendages.

      Again, on each side of the middle line there are in Ammocoetes four large
 tentacles, each of which possesses a system of muscles, muco-cartilage, and blood-
 spaces, precisely similar to the median ventral tentacle already mentioned. Each
 of these is supplied, as Miss Alcoek has shown, by a separate branch of the
 motor part of the Vth nerve (see fig. 6), and each branch is comparable with the
 branch supplying the large velar appendage.

      That such tentacles are not mere sensory papillaj suiTOundiug the mouth, but
 have a distinct and important morphological meaning, is shown by the fact that
 they are transformed in the adult Petromyzon into the remarkable tongue and
suctorial apparatus : a modification of oral appendages into a suctorial apparatus

 which is abundantly common among Arthropods.
      Finally, the Vth nerve innervates the visceral muscles of the lower and

 upper lips of Ammocojtes. In order, then, for the story to be complete, the
homologues of the lower and upper lips must also be found in the system of
prosomatic appendages of forms like Limulus and Eurypterus. The lower lip,
 like the opercular or thyroid appendage, possesses a plate of muco-cartilage, and,
as already mentioned, falls into its natural place as the metastoma of tbe old
 Eurypterus-like form, by the enlargement and forward growth of which tlie oral
chamber of Ammocojtes was formed. Tlie meaning of the upper lip will be con-
sidered with the consideration of the old mouth tube. The comparison of the
metastoma of Eurypterus with the lower lip of Ammocoetes demonstrates the
close resemblance between the oral chambers of Eurypterus and Ammocoetes. In
order to obtain the condition of affairs in Ammocoetes from that in Eurypterus, it
is only necessary that the metastoma should increase in size, and that the last
oral appendage, the large oai'-appendage, should follow the example of the other
oral appendages, and be withdrawn into the oral cavity, and so form the velar
appendage.

     Thus we see that, just as the mesosomatic appendages of Limulus can be traced
into the branchial and thyroid appendages of Ammocoetes through the inter-

mediate stage of forms similar to Eurypterus, so also the prosomatic appendages
and chilaria of Limulus can be traced into the velar and tentacular appendages
and lower lip of Ammocoetes through the intermediate stage of forms similar to
Eurypterus.

     3. Lastly comes the ontogenetic test. The concordant interpretation of the
origin of the motor part of the Vth, of the Vlltb, IXth, and Xth nerves given by
the anatomical and phylogenetic tests must explain and be illustrated by the facts
of the development of Ammocoetes.

   We see :

     1. The oral chamber of Ammocoetes is known in its early stage by the name of
the stomatodseum, and we find, as might be anticipated, that it is completely
separated at first from the branchial chamber by the septum of the stomatodasum.

     2. This septum is the embryological representative of the basal part of the
operculum, and demonstrates that originally the operculum separated the oral and
branchial chambers.

     3. Subsequently these two chambers are put into communication by the break-
ing through of this septum, illustrating the communication between the two
chambers by the separation of the median basal parts of the operculum.

     4. The velar appendages, the tentacular appendages, the lower lip, all form as
out-buddings, just as the homologous locomotor appendages are formed in arthropods.

     5. The branchial bars are not formed by a series of inpouchiiigs in a tube of
uniform thickness, but, as Shipley ' has pointed out, by a series of ingrowths at

                                                                 ' Loc. cit.

regular intervals ; in other words, the embryolog-ical history represents a series of

--buddings i.e. appendages within the branchial chamber similar to the buddings

within the oral chamber and does not indicate the formation of gill-pouches by
the thinning of an original thick tube at definite intervals.

     a. The communication of the branchial chamber with the exterior by the
formation of the gill-slits represents a stage in the ancestral history which is con-
ceivable, but cannot at present be explained with the same certainty as most of the

embryological facts of vertebrate development. I can only say that Striibel ' has
pointed out, and I can confirm him, that after the young Thelyphonus has left the
egg, and is on its mother's back, before the moult which gives it the same form as
the adult, the gills and giU-pouches are fuUy formed, but do not as yet communi-
cate with the exterior.

     7. The branchial cartilages in the Ammocoetes are formed distinctly before the
auditory capsules and trabeculse, illustrative of the fact that they alone are formed

in Limulus.

Comparison of the Auditory Appaj-atiis of Ammocoetes with the Flahellum
                     of Limulus. Meaning of the Vlllth Nerve.

   --The correctness of a theory is tested in two ways : (1) It must explain all

known facts ; and (2) it ought to bring to light what is as yet unknown, and the
more it leads to the discovery of new facts, the more certain is it that the theory
is true. So far, we see that the prosomatic and mesosomatic regions of the body in
Limulus and the scorpions are comparable with the corresponding regions of
Ammocustes as far as their locomotor and branchial appendages are concerned, and

that, therefore, a satisfactory explanation is given of the peculiarities of the Vth,

Vllth, IXth, and Xth nerves. In all vertebrates, however, there is invariably
found a special nerve, the Vlllth nerve, entirely confined to the innervation of the

myspecial sense-organs of the auditory apparatus. It follows, therefore, that if

theory is true the Vlllth nerve must be found in such forms as Limulus and its
allies, and that, therefore, a special sense-organ, probably auditory in nature, must
exist between the prosomatic and mesosomatic appendages, at the very base of the

last prosomatic appendage. At present we Icnow nothing about the nature or

locality of the hearing apparatus of Limulus. It is, therefore, all the more in-
teresting to find that in the very position demanded by the theory, at the base of
 the last prosomatic appendage, is found a large hemispherical organ, to which a
 movable spatula-like process is attaclied, known by the name of the flahellum.
 This organ is confined to the base of this limb; it is undoubtedly a special sense-
 organ, being composed mainly of nerves, in connection with an elaborate arrange-
 ment of cells and innumerable fine hairs, which are thickly imbedded in the chitin
 of the upper surface of the spatula. The arrangement of these cells and hairs is
 somewhat similar to that of various sense-organs described by Gaubert,- and

supposed to be auditory. When the animal is at rest this sensory surface projects

 upwards and backwards into the crack between the prosomatic and mesosomatic
 carapaces, so that while the eyes only permit a look-out forwards and sidewards,
 and the whole animal is lying half buried in the sand, any vibrations in the water
 around can still pass through this open crevice, and so reach the sensory surface of

 this organ.

       Finally, the most striking and complete evidence that this sense-organ of
 Limulus is homologous with the auditory capsule of Ammocoetes is found in the
 fact that in each case the nerve is accompanied into tlie capsule by a diverticulum
 of the liver and generative organs. (See dotted substance in figs. 4 and 6.) In
 Limulus the liver and generative organs, which surround the central nervous system
 from one end of the body to the other, do not penetrate into any of the appendages,
 with the single exception of the flahellum.

the brain and spinal cord, and lias already been recognised as the remains of the
liver and generative organs, does not penetrate into the velar or other appendages,
but is found only in the auditory capsiue, where it enters with and partly surrounds

the auditory nerve.

    The coincidence is so startling and unexpected as to bring conviction to my
mind that in the fiabellum of Limulus we are observing the origin of the vertebrate

auditory apparatus ; and it is, to say the least of it, suggestive that in Galeodes the
last locomotor appendage should carry the extraordinary racquet-shaped organs
which Gaubert has shov^^^ to be sense-organs of a special character, and that in the
scorpion a large special sense-organ of a corresponding character, viz. the pecten,
should be found which, from its innervation, as given by Patten,^ appears to belong
to the segment immediately anterior to the operculum, rather than to that imme-

diately posterior to it.

Compa/rison of the Olfactory Organ of Ammocoetes with the Camerostome of
     Thelyphonus. Meaning of the 1st Nerve. Also comjyarison of the
      Hypophysis with the Mouth-tuhe of Thelyphonus.

     In precisely the same way as the theory has led to the discovery of a special
sense-organ in Limulus and its allies which may well be auditory, so also it must

lead to the discovery of the olfactory apparatus of the same group, for here also, just

as in the case of the auditory apparatus, we are at present entirely in the dark.

     The olfactory organ in such an animal as Thelyphonus ought to be innervated
from the supra-cesophageal ganglia, and ought to be situated in the middle line, in
front of the mouth. The mouth is at the anterior end in these animals, the lower
lip or hypostoma (see fig. 9) being formed by the median projecting flanges of the
basal joints of the two pedipalpi ; above, in the middle line, is a peculiar median
appendage called the camerostome. Still more dorsal we find in the median line
the rostrum, with the median eyes near its extremity, and laterally on each side of
the camerostome, and dorsal to it, are situated the powerful chelicerae, which are
considered by some authorities to represent antennje. Of these parts the camero-
stome is certainly innervated from the supra-cesophageal ganglia, and upon cutting
sagittal and transverse sections in a very young Thelyphonus we find that the
surface is remarkably covered with very fine sense-hairs, arranged with great regu-
larity and connected with a conspicuous mass of large cells. Upon making trans-

verse sections through this region we see that the camerostome projects into the

orifice of the mouth, and that its sense-epithelium forms, together with a similar
epithelium on the lower lip, a closed cavity surrounded by a thick hedge of fine
hau's. Here, then, in the camerostome of Thelyphonus is a special sense-organ

Avhich, from its position and its innervation, may well be olfactory in function, or at

all events subserve the function of taste.

    Upon comparing this organ -^^ith the olfactory organ of Ammocoetes we see a

most striking resemblance in general arrangement and structure.
     J ust as the mouth tube of Thelyphonus is formed of two parts, the pedipalp and

camerostome, so, according to Kuppfer, the nasal tube of Ammocoetes is composed
of two parts, the upper lip and the olfactory protuberance. Of these two parts

we see that the upper lip, or hood, lOce the pedipalp, is innervated by the Vth nerve,

or nerve of the prosomatic appendages, while the olfactory protuberance, like the

camerostome, is innervated by the 1st nerve. Ivuppfer's investigations show us
fiu'ther (fig. 9) bow the olfactory protuberance is at first free, is directed

ventralwards, and lies at the opening of the hypophysial tube how afterwards, by
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

the forward and upward growth of the upper lip to form the hood, the nasal tube
is formed, with the result that the nasal opening lies on the dorsal surface just in
front of the pineal eye. Kuppfer, like Dohrn and Beard, looks upon this hypo-
physial tube as indicating the palfeostoma, or original mouth of the vertebrate, a

view which harmonises absolutely with my theory, and receives the simplest of

explanations from it, for, as you see on the screen, sections through the mouth tube

Ammocoetes ; here in the one section is the projecting camerostome, there is the
corresponding projection of the olfactory protuberance, here is the sense-epithelium
of the lower lip or hypostoma, there is the sense-epithelium of the upper lip or
hood. Here, as fig. 9 shows, the mouth tube passes in the ventral middle
line to where it turns dorsalwards into the middle of the conjoined nen'ous mass

ventral appendages the pedipalpi to form the liypostoma, in the corresponding

position the upper lip or hood of Ammoccetes, -which forms the hypostoma as far

as the hypophysial tube or palseostoma is concerned, but an upper lip as far as the

new mouth is concerned. The muscles of tbis upper lip belong all to the splanch-

nic and not to the somatic group, and are innervated by the appropriate nerve of

the prosomatic appendages, viz. the motor part of the Vth, Ventral to the pedi-

palpi in Thelyphonus there is nothing, ventral to the corresponding lip in the

Ammoccetes is the lower lip, and we have seen that, although such a structure is

absent in the land scorpions of the present daj^, it was present in the sea scorpions

of old time, was known as the metastoma, and is supposed to be a forward growth

which started at the jimction of the prosoma with the mesosoma. Precisely corre-

sponding to this we see from Kuppfer that the lower lip of Ammocoetes is a forward

growth from the junction of the stomatodfeum with the respiratoi-y chamber.

   We see then, so far, that the comparison of the vertebrate nervous system

with the conjoined central nervous system and alimentary canal of the arthropod

has led to a perfectly consistent explanation of almost all the peculiarities of the

head region of Ammoccetes. "NVe have solved the segmentation of the skull and the

mysteries of the cranial nerves, for we have found that the cranial segmentation of

the vertebrate can be reduced to the segmentation of the prosomatic and mesoso-

matic regions of the Limulus, that the cranial skeleton arose from the modified

internal chitinous skeleton of the Limulus, that the new mouth was formed by the

forward growth of the metastoma, leading to the formation of an oral chamber,

while the old mouth remained as the hypophysial tube, guarded by its olfactory

and taste organs.

Search as we may in the prosomatic and mesosomatic regions of scorpion-like

animals, there are but few points left for elucidation ; among these the most

important  are, 1, the fate of the  coelomic  cavities and coxal gland                                                                                                                   2, the fate of

   Comparison of the Head Cavities of the Vertebrate with the Prosomatic
                    and Mesosomatic Cceloniic Spaces of Limidus.

    A recent paper by Kishinouye ' on the development of Limulus enables us to

compare the coelomic cavities in the head region of a vertebrate with those of the

prosomatic and mesosomatic segments of Limulus, and we see that the comparison is

wonderfully close ; for whereas each mesosomatic segment possesses a coelomic cavity,
just as eacii of the segments of the branchial chamber supplied by the vagus, glosso-
pharyngeal, and facial nerves possesses a coelomic cavity, this is not the case with the
prosomatic segments. In these latter the first coelomic cavity is a large prieoral one,

common to the segment of the first appendage and all the segments in front of it

the segments belonging to the second, third, and fourth appendages have no coelomic
cavities formed in them, the second coelomic cavity belongs to the segment of the
fifth appendage. Similarly in the vertebrate in the region corresponding to the
prosoma there are only two head cavities recognised, viz. the 1st prseoral head
cavity of Balfour and V. Wijhe ; and 2nd or mandibular head cavity, associated

especially with the Vth nerve. According to my view the motor part of the Yth

nerve represents the locomotor prosomatic appendages of Limulus, and we see

that already in Limulus the three foremost of these appendages do not form

coelomic cavities.

      In fact, the agreement in the formation and position of the coelomic cavities in
the head region of the vertebrate and in the prosomatic and mesosomatic regions
of Limulus could not well be more exact ; further, these cavities agree in this, that
in neither case are they permanent ; both in the vertebrate and in the arthropod
they are supplanted by vascular spaces.

Comparison of the Pituitarij Gland with the Coxal Gland of Limulus.

In connection with the second coelomic cavity in Limulus is found an ancient

gland, partially degenerated according to some views, which was probably excretory

in function and has been considered as homologous to the crustacean green glands.

In a precisely corresponding position, and presenting a structure fairly similar to

that of the coxal gland of Limulus, we find in Ammocojtes and in other vertebrates

Howthe pituitary gland.                                                  far this gland tissue is developed in connection with

the mandibular head cavity I do not know, but I venture to suggest that the

complete evidence of its homology with the coxal gland will be found in its

developmental connection with the walls of the 2nd or mandibular head

cavity.

Comjmrison of the Vertebrate Heart and Ventral Aorta loith the Ventral
        Longitudinal Branchial Sinuses of Limulus and its Allies.

     The heart of the vertebrate presents two striking peculiarities, which make it
different from all invertebrate hearts : first, its developmental history is different;

and, secondly, it is at first essentially a branchial rather than a systemic heart.

The researches of Paul Mayer ' have shown that the subintestinal vein, from which
in the fishes the heart and ventral aorta arise, is in its origin double, so that in all

vertebrates the heart and ventral aorta arise from two long veins which are

originally situated on each side of the middle line. By the formation of the head

fold these come together ventrally, coalesce into a single tube to form the
subintestinal vein and heart, still remaining double as the two ventral aortse
with their branchial branches into each gill, as is well sliown in the case of
Ammocoetes.

It is a striking coincidence that in Limulus and the Scorpions two large

venous collecting sinuses are found situated in tlie same ventral position, for the

same purpose of sending blood to the branchiiB, as already described for the

vertebrate                                                  still  more  striking  is it  to  find, according  to the' researches of Milne
                                                         ;

Edwards and Blanchard, that these longitudinal sinuses have already begun to

function as branchial hearts, for they are connected with the pericardium by a system

of transparent muscles, described by Milne Edwards and named by Lankester veno-

pericardiac muscles. These muscles are hollow, both near the vein and near the
pericardium, so that the blood in each case fills the cavity, and, as they contract
with the heart, that part of them in connection with the venous collecting sinus
already functions, as pointed out by Milne Edwards and J51anchard, as a branchial

heart.

    By this theory, then, even the formation of the vertebrate heart is prevised in
Limulus, and I venture to think that in Ammoccetes we see the remnant of the

old dorsal single heart of the arthropod in the form of that peculiar elongated
organ composed of fattily degenerated tissue which lies between the spinal cord
and the dorsal median skin.

     Comparison of the Cuticular and Laminated Layers of the Skin of

                                Ammoccetes with Chitinous Layers.

     The external epithelial cells of Ammoccetes possess a remarkably thick cuticular
layer. The striated appearance of this layer is due to a number of pores through
which the glandular contents of the cells are poured when the surface is made to
secrete. That this striated appearance is due to true porous canals, just as in
chitin, and not to a series of rods, is easily seen by the inspection of sections, and
also by watching the secretion through them of rose-coloured granules when the
living cell is stained with methylene blue. The surface layer of this cuticular
layer, according to Wolff',- resists reagents in the same manner as chitin.

Internal to the epithelial cells of the skin of Ammocoetea is a remarkable

layer of tissue, generally called connective tissue. It resembles, however, histo-

logically, in  the  Ammoccetes,  a  section                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           through  chitin  most closely                                                             the  layers

are perfectly regular and parallel ; cells are found in it with great sparseness, and

it is not until after transformation, when it is altered and invaded by new cell

elements, that it can be looked upon as at all resembling connective tissue. It

resembles chitin in its reaction to hypochlorite of soda. In order to completely

dissect oft" this laminated layer from an Ammoccetes, all that is necessary is to
place the animal in a weak solution of hypochlorite of soda, and in a short time it

entirely disappears, bringing to view the muscles, branchial cartilages, pigment,

front dorsal part of the central nervous system. Sec, in a most striking manner.

At present I am puzzled that so manifest a chitiuous covering should lie internal

to the epithelial cells of the surface ; such a position is not, however, unknown
among invertebrates, and may be accounted for in various wavs.

     For the sake of clearness I will sum up before you in the form of a table the
corresponding parts in Ammoccetes and in Limulus and its allies, as far as I have

discussed them up to the present, from which you will see that there is not a

single organ which is present in the prosomatic and mesosomatic regions of

Limulus and its allies which is not found in the corresponding situation and of

corresponding structure in Ammoccetes.

                        The Possible Meaning of the Notochord.

     Although we can say that every structure and organ in the prosomatic and

mesosomatic regions of Limulus, &c., is to be found in the head region of Ammo-
ccetes, we cannot assert the reverse proposition, that every organ in the head region

of Ammoccetes is to be found in Limulus, &c., for we find a notable exception in
the case of the notochord, a structure which is par excellence a vertebrate structure,
and has in consequence given the current name to the group. Such a structure is

clearly not to be found in Limulus and its allies ; it has evidently arisen in connec-
tion with the formation of the vertebrate alimentary canal from the oral and
branchial chambers, and it evidently at one time possessed a functional significance,

for the lower we descend in the vertebrate scale the more conspicuous it becomes.
     Unfortunately we know nothing of the condition of the notochord in the early

extinct fishes, so that we are reduced to the embryological method of enquiry in our
endeavours to find out the meaning of this organ. This method appears to point

to the origin of the notochord from a tube connected with the alimentary canal,

originally therefore an accessory digestive tube ; the reasons why such a view has

been put forward are, first, the origin of the notochord from hypoblast ; secondly,
the evidence that it is to a certain extent tubular; and thirdly, that it is an
unsegmented tube extending from the oral to the anal regions of the body.

Another argument, to my mind stronger than any other, is based on the principle

that nature repeats herself, and if, therefore, we find the same proliferation of
cells in the same place forming a series of solid notochordal rods, we may fairly
argue that we are observing a series of repetitions of the same process for the same

object. Now the formation of the head region of Petromyzon shows that at first

a median proliferation of hypoblastic cells occurs to form the notochord, which
then separates oft" from the hypoblast ; later on a similar proliferation takes place
to form the subnotochordal rod, which similarly separates off from the hypoblast
later still, at the time of transformation, a third median proliferation of the cells of
the hypoblast takes place, to form a solid rod of cells. This solid rod then com-
mences to hollow out at the end nearest the intestine, and the hollowing out

 process extends gradually to the oral end, until a hollow tube is formed connecting-

 the mouth with the intestine. In this way the new gut of the adult Petromyzon

 IS formed from a solid median rod of cells closely resembling in its formation the

 original notochord.

      I put it forward therefore as a suggestion, that in the ancient times when the
 Merostomata were lords of creation and the competition was keen among these
 ancient arthropod forms, in which the nervous system was so arranged that
 increase of brain substance tended more and more to compress the food channel,
 and therefore to compel to the suction of liquid food instead of the mastication
 of solid, accessory digestive apparatuses were formed, partly in connection
 with the formation of the oral and respiratory chambers, and partly by means of
 the formation of the notochord. Of these accessory methods of digestion the
 former became permanent, while the latter becoming filled up with the peculiar
iiotochordal tissue became a supporting structure, still showing by its unsegmented
character its original function. That a tube formed from the external surface

 either as notochord or as the respiratory portion of the alimentary canal in
 Ammocostes should be capable of acting as a digestive tube is clear from the
xesearches of Miss Alcock,^ for she has shown that the secretion of the skin of
Ammocffites easily digests fibrin in the presence of acid. Such a secretion, like the

similar secretion of the carapace of Daphnia and other crustaceans, was orio-inally

for the purpose of keeping the skin clean.

     The evidence which I have put before you is in agreement with the conclusion

that the fore gut of the vertebrate arose gradually from a chamber formed by the

lamellar branchial appendages, which functioned also as a digestive chamber. By

the growth of the lower lip, or metastoma, and the modification of the basal portion
of the last locomotor appendage, which basal part was inside the lower lip, into a
valvular arrangement like the velum, the animal was able to close the opening into

the respiratory chamber and feed as blood-sucker in the way of the rest of its kind,
or, when living food was scarce, keep itself alive by the organic material taken into
its respiratory chamber with the muddy water in which it lived.

               The Possible Formation of the Vertebrate Spinal Eegion.

      It remains to briefly indicate the evidence as to the formation of the rest of the
alimentary canal and the spinal region of the body.

     The problems connected with the formation of this region are of a different
nature from those already considered in connection with the cranial region.

      In the cranial region the variation that has taken place within the verte-
brate group and in the course of the formation of the vertebrate is, on the
whole, of the nature called by Bateson substantive, i.e. increase or suppression
of parts, while throughout the parts remain constant in their relations to each

other. It matters not whether it is frog, fish, bird, or mammal we are considerino-
we always find the same cranial nerves supplying the same segments. When we

consider the spinal cord and its immediate junction with the cranial region, this
is no longer so ; here we find a repetition of similar segments, with great variation

in the amount of that repetition ; here we find the characteristic feature is meristic

variation rather than substantive, and so indetermined is the vertebrate in this

respect that even now the same species of animal varies in the number of its

segments and in the arrangement of its nerves. In this part of the vertebrate
body this repetition is seen not only in the central nervous system and its nerves,
but also in the excretory organs, so that embryology teaches us that the vertebrate
body has grown in length by a series of repetitions of similar segments formed
between the head end and the tail end ; such lengthening by repetition of scments
has been accompanied by the elongation of the unsegmented gut, of the unsegmented
notochord, and of the unsegmented neural canal.

     To put it shortly, all the evidence points to and confirms the view so strongly
ui"ged by Gegenbauer, that the head region is the oldest part and the spinal

region an aftertliouizlit, that the attempt so often made to find vertebras and spinal

--nerves in the cranial region is an attempt to put the cart in front of the horse to

obtain vouth from old age. AVe may, it seems to me, fairly argue from the sequence
of events in the embryology of vertebrates that the primitive vertebrate form was
chiefly composed of the head region, and that between the head and the tail was a
short body region. In other words, the respiratory chamber and the cloacal region
were originally close together, just as would be the casein Limulusif the branchial

apj)endages formed a closed chamber. According, then, to my view, there would

be no difficulty in the respiratory chamber opening originally into the cloacal
region, i.e. the same cloacal region into which the neurenteric canal already
opened. The short junction tube thus formed would naturally elongate with the
elongation of the body, and, as it originally was part of the respiratory chamber,
it equally naturally is innervated by the vagus nerve. This, then, is the explana-
tion of that most extraordinary fact, viz. that a nerve essentially branchial should
innervate the whole of the intestine except the cloacal region. Whether this is the
true explanation of the formation of the mid-gut of the vertebrate cannot be tested

directly, but certain corollaries ought to follow : we ought to find, on the ground

that the sequence of the phylogenetic history is repeated in the embryo, that,
1, the growth in length of the embryo takes place between the cranial and sacral

regions by the addition of new segments from the cranial end ; 2, the formation
of the fore-gut and hind-gut ought to be completed while the mid- gut is still an

undifferentiated mass of yolk cells ; 3. the cloacal region ought to be innervated
from the sacral nerves, while the stomach, mid-gut and its appendages, liver and
pancreas, ought to be innervated from the vagus.

     The first proposition is a well-known enibryological fact. The second pro-
position is also well known for all vertebrates, and is especially well exemplified in
the embryological development of Ammocates, according to Shipley. The third
proposition is also well known, and has received valuable enlargement in the recent
researches of Langley and Anderson.* Further, we see that in this part of the
body the ancestor of the vertebrate must have had a ccelomic cavity the walls of
which were innervated, not from the mesosomatic nerves or respiratory nerves, but
from the metasomatic group of nerves ; and in connection with this body cavity
there must have existed a kidney apparatus, also innervated by the metasomatic
nerves ; with the repetition of segments by which the elongation of the animal was
brought about the body cavity was elongated, and the kidney increased by the

repetition of similar excretory organs. All, then, that is required in the original

ancestor in order to obtain the permanent body cavitj- and urinary organs charac-
teristic of the vertebrate is to postulate the presence of a perojanent body cavity in
connection with a single pair of urinary tubes in the metasomatic region of the

body. As yet I have not worked out this part of my theory, and am therefore

strongly disinclined to make any assertions on the subject. I should like, however,
to point out that, according to Kishinouye,'^ a permanent body cavity does exist in
this part of the body in spiders, known by the name of the stercoral pocket ; into

this coelomic cavity the excretory Malphigian tubes open.

                                         The ralceontological Evidence,

     It is clear, from what has already been said, that the palseontological evidence
ought to show, first, that the vertebrates appeared when the waters of the ocean
were peopled with the forefathers of the Crustacea and Arachnida, and, secondly,
the earliest fish-like forms ought to be characterised by the presence of a large
cephalic part to which is attached an insignificant body and tail.

      Such was manifestly the case, for the earliest fish-like forms appear in
the midst of and succeed to the great era of strange proto-crustacean animals,
when the sea swarmed with Trilobites, Eurypterus, Slimonia, Limulus,
Pterygotus, Ceratiocaris, and a number of other semi-crustacean, semi-arachnid

creatures. When we examine these ancient fishes we find such forms as Pteraspis^

Pterichthys, Astrolepls, Bothriolepis, Cephalaspis, all characterised by the enormous
disproportion between the extent of the head region and that of the body. Such
forms would have but small power of locomotion, and further evolution consisted
in gaining greater rapidity and freedom of movements by the elongation of the
abdominal and tail regions, with the result that the head region became less and
less prominent, until finally the ordinary fish-like form was evolved, in which the
head and gills represent the original head and branchial chamber, and the flexible
body, with its lateral line nerve and intestine innervated by the vagus nerve,
represents the original small tail-like body of such a form as Pterichthys.

     Nay, more, the very form of Pterichthys and the nature of its two large oar-like

appendages, which, according to Traquair, are hollow, like the legs of insects, sug-
gest a form like Eurypterus, in which the remaining- locomotor appendages had
shrunk to tentacles, as in Ammoccstes, while the large oar-like appendages still
remained, coming out between the upper and lower lips and assisting locomotion.

The Ammoccetes-like forms which in all probability existed between the time of
Eurypterus and the time of Pterichthys have not yet been found, owing possibly

to the absence of chitin and of bone in these transition forms, unless we may
count among them the recent find by Traquair of Palseospondylus Gunni.

     The evidence of palaeontology, as far as it goes, confirms absolutely the evi-
dence of anatomy, physiology, phylogeny, and embryology, and assists in forming
a perfectly consistent and harmonious account of the origin of vertebrates, the
whole evidence showing how Nature made a great mistake, how excellently she
rectified it, and thereby formed the new and mighty kingdom of the Vertebrata.

                                           Consideration of Rival Theories.

    In conclusion I would ask, What are the alternative theories of the origin of
vertebrates ? It is a strange and striking fact how often, when a comparative

anatomist studies a particular invertebrate group, he is sure to find the vertebrate
at the end of it : it matters not whether it is the Nemertines, the Capitellidse,
Balanoglossus, the Helminths, Annelids, or Echinoderms ; the ancestor of the verte-

brate is bound to be in that particular group. Verily I believe the Mollusca alone

have not yet found a champion. On the whole I imagine that two views are

--most prominent at the present day (1) to derive vertebrates from a group of

animals in which the alimentary canal has always been ventral to the nervous
system ; and (2) to derive vertebrates from the appendiculate group of animals,
especially annelids, by the supposition that the dorsal gut of the latter has become

the ventral gut of the former by reversion of surfaces. Upon this latter theory,
whether it is Dohrn or van Beneden or Patten who attempts to homologise similar

parts, it is highly amusing to see the hopeless confusion into which they one and
all get, and the extraordinary hypotheses put forward to explain the fact that thf
gut no longer pierces the brain. One favourite method is to cut off* the most
important part of the animal, viz. his supra-oesophageal ganglia, then let the mouth

open at the anterior end of the body, turn the animal over, so that the gut is now
ventral, and let a new brain, with new eyes, new olfactory organs, grow forward
from the infra-cesophageal ganglia. Another ingenious method is to separate the
two supra-oesophageal ganglia, let the mouth tube sling round through the separated

ganglia from ventral to dorsal side, then join up the ganglia and reverse the
animal. The old attempts of Owen and Dohrn to pierce the dorsal part of the
brain with the gut tube either in the region of the pineal eye or of the fourth
ventricle have been given up as hopeless. Still the annelid theory, with its
reversal of surfaces, lingers on, even though the fact of the median pineal eye is
sufficient alone to show its absolute worthlessness.

     Then, as to the other view, what a demand does that make upon our credulity!

We are to suppose that a whole series of animals has existed on the earth, the

development of which has run parallel with that of the great group of appendiculate
animals, but throughout the group the nervous system has always been dorsal to
the alimentary canal. Of this great group no trace remains, either alive at the

                                                                                                   3e2

present day or in tlie record of the i-ocks, except one or two aberrant, doubtful

forms, and the group of Tunicates and Amphioxus, both of which are to be looked

upon as degenerate vertebrates, and indeed are more nearly allied to the Ammo-

coetes than to any other animal. This hypothetical group does not attempt to

explain any of the peculiarities of the central nervous sj'stem of vertebrates : its

advocates, in the words of Lankester, regard the tubular condition of the central

nervous system as in its origin a purely developmental feature, possessing no

pliylogenetic importance. Strange power of mimicry in nature, that a tube so

formed should mimic, in its terminations, in its swellings, in the whole of its topo-

graphical relations to the nervous masses surrounding it, the alimentary canal of

the other great group of segmented animals so closely as to enable mo to put before

you so large a number of coincidences.

WeJust imagine to yourselves what we are required to believe !            are to

suppose that two groups of animals have diverged from a common stock some-

where in the region of the Ccelenterata, that each group has become segmented and

elongated, but that throughout their evolution the one group has possessed a

-- --ventral mouth, with a ventral nervous system end a dorsal gut, while in the

other the hypothetical group -the mouth and gut have throughout been ventral
and the nervous system dorsal. Then we are further to suppose that, without

being able to trace the steps of the process, the central nervous system in the final

members of this hypothetical group has taken on a tubular form of so striking a

ciiaracter that every part of this dorsal nerve-tube can be compared to tl\e dorsal

alimentary tube of the other great group of segmented animals. The plain,

.straitrhtforward interpretation of the facts is what I have put before you, and

those who oppose this interpretation and hold to the inviolability of the alimentary

canal are, it seems to me, bound to give a satisfactory explanation of the vertebrate
nervous system and pineal eye. The time is coming, and indeed has come, when
the fetish-worship of the hypoblast will give way to the acknowledgment that the

soul of every individual is to be found in the brain, and not in the stomach, and

that the true principle of evolution, without which no upward progress is possible,

consists in the steady upward development of the central nervous system.

In conclusion, I would like to quote a portion of the last letter which I ever

received from Professor Huxley ; his words, in reference to this very subject, were

as follows : ' Go on and prosper, there is nothing in the world of science half so

    The following Papers and Report were read :

          1. The Genesis of Vowels. By R. J. Lloyd, D.LU., M.A.

      After a general description of the vocal organs, the author classified vocal
Ounds according to origin as follows :

               1. Glottal (originating from the glottis).
               2. Stomatic (originating from the stoma, or voice -passage).
               3. Glotto-stomatic (originating from both simultaneously).

    Class 2 may also be called toneless; but the others always either possess tone or

are whispered. Class 2 cannot, strictly speaking, be either intoned or whispered.

     The movable units of speech (corresponding roughly to the letters of the
alpbiibet) are called phones. Phones are either vowels or consonants. The

received division is somewhat arbitrary. Any phone which is the most sonorous

phone in a syllable is the vowel of that syllable. There is hardly any phone
which does not function in some locution of some language as a vowel. In the
English words able, hitten, paddled, hadn't, I and 7i are vowels, but we are afraid
   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.  973

   to call tbein so, because the Latin grammar forbids it. It is clear from their
   function that the best phones for vowels must always be the strongest phones.
   The strongest phones all belong to Class 1, because here only does the larynx
   Tibrate with perfect freedom. But there are wide differences within this class.
   The sounds of m, n, and ?;</, issuing only through the nostrils, are obstructed by
   insufficiency of exit, and the same applies to the sounds of I, untrilled r, conso-
   nantal j/, and w. Thus good Aowels are limited to glottal phones possessing a

   sufficient exit.

        There is still a further limitation. The number of possible vocalic articulations
   is infinite. The number of articulations which produce vowels possessing a definite
   individuality of timbre is very few. These are the useful vowels, the cardinal
   vowels of human speech [Diagrams of the articulations of English long vowels
   were here exhibited]. Vowels produced in other positions are much more feebly

   diflferentiated to the ear. In a paper read at the Cardifi" meeting in 1891, the

   author laid down as the first law of vowel-production Like cirtimdations produce

   like lotvels in all organisms, great or small. He now discussed the converse pro-

   position, and showed its limitations: (1) in diflerent individuals, (2) in the same

   individual on diflerent occasions. He then discussed the difliereuces between

   sung and spoken vowels, and concluded by pointing out the occasional efl'ects of
   the uvula, the nose, and the trachea on vowels.

                   2. The Interpretation of the Phonograms of Voivels.

                               By R. J. Lloyd, D.LiL, M.A.

       Following up his papers ' On the Analysis of Vowel-Sounds,' read at Cardift' in
   1891, and 'On the Genesis of Vowels,' read at the present Meeting, the author

   proceeded to discuss the phonographic evidence which has become accessible in the
   last five years, and the right principles of its interpretation. Their general result
   is to confirm the theory then advanced by the author, that a given vowel is
   essentially distinguished by the interval or ratio between its resonances and not
   by their actvial pitch. Detailed results were exhibited in a table. The figures of
   actual pitch therein given are true only of full-sized male organisms, articulating
   widely, as in singing. In actual speech the air-spaces are more or less compressed
   and the resonances are higher. This is especially true of the middle members,
   marked c in the series. This letter c ( = circa) indicates also in the same vowels
   a resonance which spreads some distance both ways from the value given. The
   identification of the /3-resonances with those of the mouth is fairly certain ; that of
   the a-resonances with those of the pharynx is more tentative, and subject to
   certain qualifications, especially in the latter half of the table. The ·y-resonance
   seems special to the a vowels, and is perhaps due to the trachea.

   4. On a New Method of Distinguishing between Organic and InorganiG

                               Compounds of Iron in the Tissues.

               By Professor A. B. Macallum, M.B., Ph.D., Toronto.

        The reagents hitherto at the service of the physiologist for distinguishing
   between organic and inorganic iron compounds have not enabled the investigator to
   determine whether iron compounds in the foetal liver, the placenta and spleen,
   which react almost immediately with ammonium sulphide, are of inorganic or

   organic nature. An additional reagent is to be found in an absolutely pure

   aqueous solution of hsematoxylin, which gives a yellow colour to all preparations of

   tissues, but when inorganic iron compounds are present these change the colour
   to blue or bluish-black. Organic iron compounds have no effect ou the reagent.

             5. On the Different Forms of the Respiration in Man.
                           By W. Marcet, M.D., F.R.S.

    The different forms may be thus stated :

     1. Normal, automatic (unconscious) breathing.
     2. Forced breathing
     3. Breathing in exercise.
     4. Breathing under tlie influence of a strong effort of volition.

  --Forced breathing. If a succession of deep inspirations be taken, the tracing

rises much more steeply than normal, a pause (apncea) follows, and then breathing
returns increased beyond normal, after which the line returns parallel to normal.

--Forced breathing includes sneezing, and sighing, and yawning.
     Exercise breathing. In exercise such as stepping, the line rises more steeply
than normal, there is no pause or cessation of exei'cise, but the line continues

--steeper than normal for some time and gradually returns parallel to normal.
      Volition breathing. If the Tolition be exercised strongly towards muscular
work of some kind, though with the muscles at rest, the volume of the air inspired is

increased beyond the normal. On dropping the effort of volition a respiratory pause

follows, and then increased breathing and gradual return to normal, the tracing

taking much the same direction as in forced breathing. If, however, the volition

be directed towards the respiration there is no pause, but the line returns parallel to
normal almost directly. Volition for any kind of muscular exercise produces the

pause, but when the attention is directed towards the respiration there is no

apnoea.

     Even when exercise such as stepping or gyrating the arms is taken, when the

volition is exerted as strongly as possible towards the exercise, on dropping the
effort of -volition, even though the exercise be continued, the pause is still strongly
marked.

     The only possible explanation of the occurrence of the pause is that when the

attention is directed towards the respiration only one brain centre is concerned,

and hence when the effort of volition is dropped no time is lost before the centre
of respiration asserts itself ; whereas when the volition is exerted towards some
form of exercise, two brain centres are concerned, and on dropping the effort of

volition, some time (a few seconds) is lost before the centre of respiration has
shaken off the influence of the centre of IcJcomotion ; and it is to this that the
pause must be due, and not any excess of oxygen in the blood, as the automatic
respiration of 50 per cent, oxygen produces no pause.

     The following Papers were read :

                              1. The Occurrence of Fever in Mice.

By Professor J. Lorrain Smith, M.A., M.D., Queen's College, Belfast,

                  and F. F. Wesbrook, M.D., Miimeapolis, U.S.A.

      Krehl's investigation on the production of fever in various species of animals
has proved that a great difference exists in the extent to which some of the smaller

mammals react to fever-producing substances. It is comparatively easy, he found,
to produce fever in rabbits. Guinea-pigs and dogs were more resistent, and in the
case of the hedgehog it was impossible, so far as his research was carried, to pro-

duce the condition at all. Similar results were obtained with pigeons and chickens.
The present research attempts to discover whether in the case of mice the same
difficulty in the production of fever exists ; and, if so, whether there is at the same
time an absence of the changes in metabolism which in other animals accompany

fever.
TKANS ACTIONS OF SECTION I.  975

   A variety of microbes were used, including B. pyocyaneus, B. anthracis,

B. murisej)ticus, and hay infusion. These were used in various degrees of virulence,
but whether the rapidly fatal form or that which was more attenuated was
inoculated, in no case did the effects include a rise in temperature. In three of the
mice the respiratory exchange, and in live others the respiratory and nitrogenous
exchanges, were observed. The temperature of the mouse varies from 35° C. to
39'2° 0., and the average of seventy observations on normal mici^ living in ordinary
conditions, was 37 '6° 0. The highest temperature we obtained in inoculated mice
was 40° C, and this Ave observed only once.

     The variations in respiratory exchange were never so great as to be compared
with those which can be obtained bj^ giving food, or especially- those due to vary-
ing the temperature of the surrounding air. As regards nitrogen it is possible in
the case of mice to approximate very closely to balance in the normal condition.
In the case of infected mice there was never obtained any increase in the excretion
of nitrogen sufficient to warrant tis in inferring that the metabolism had been

disturbed.

     The food supplied to the mice was dog biscuit, and with this the amount of
nitrogen consumed per kilo was somewhere about twenty times as great as that
taken by man per kilo (19"58 per kilo being the average).

     This result is important, inasmuch as the gaseous exchange in the two cases
shows an almost similar ratio. Since the demands for heat production in the

meconomy of the mouse must be enormously greater than those man this result

throws some doubt on any attempt to regard the oxidation of carbon, &c., as

exclusively concerned in heat production.

     The conclusion involves the severance between fever and the infectious process
in some of the most susceptible animals, and indicates anew the necessity of study-

ing the occurrence of this condition in the separate species.

2. The Physiological Effects of ' Fej^tone ' ivhen Injected into the Circulation.

       By Professor W. H. Thompson, M.D., Queen's College, Belfast.

     This communication dealt with two of the effects of Witte's ' peptone ' when
introduced into the system of the dog by intravenous injection, viz. (1) Its
influence on the rapidity of blood coagulation, and (2) the manner in which this
substance brings about its well known vascular dilatation.

      The animals were anassthetised in the first place by a hypodermic injection
of morphine and atropine, and subsequently, when necessary, by chloroform or a
mixture of chloroform and ether. Curare was administered in certain cases.

   A solution of Witte's ' peptone ' in 0-7 per cent, sodium chloride was then

rapidly injected into the femoral vein, blood-pressure being recorded from the

carotid artery.

   --The results obtained were :

     1. That Witte's peptone in doses below two centigrammes per kilo hastens

blood-coagulation, while in larger doses retardation of this process is caused, as
other observers have found.

     2. That this substance produces a fall of blood-pressure in doses as low as
fifteen or even ten milligrammes per kilo. Differences between these results and
those of others, in regard to the magnitude of the dose, probably depend on differ-

ences in the rate of injection employed. When slowly injected considerable

quantities may be introduced without affecting blood-pressure.

      3. That the fall of blood-pressure produced by this substance is due to a

peripheral dilating influence on the blood-vessels. No ' central ' influence has so

far been proved.
      4. That the vascular dilatation is not confined to the splanchnic area, but

extends to other blood-vessels as well.
     5. That»the peripheral dilating influence is brought about by depressing the

irritability of the neuro-muscular apparatus of the blood-vessels, rendering it

irresponsive to vaso-constricting impulses.

                                                                                          .

      G. It is probable that the depression of irritability is chiefly limited to tlie
nervous segment of the neuro-muscular couple.

      In arriving at the above results the following series of experiments were per-
formed :

      Series a, in which the eflects of small doses on blood-coagulation and blood-
pressure were observed.

      Series h, in which the effects of ' peptone ' on blood-pressure after section of the
spinal cord were observed.

     Series c, in which its effects on blood-pressure during excitation of the spinal
cord (after section) were studied.

      Series d, in which its influence on blood-pressure during excitation of the great
fjtlanchnics (after section) was noted.

     Series e, in which its effects on blood-pressure were recorded, the great
xplanchnics being severed and the sjnnal cord excited (after section) during and

subsequent to the injection.

     The research was carried out iu Monsieur Dastre's laboratory at the Sorbonne,

I'aris.

3. On the Nerves of the Intestine and the Effects of Small Doses of Nicotine
    upon them. By J. L. Bunch, M.D., B.Sc. (From the Physiological

     Laboratory, University College, London.)

     1. Description of method adopted in the research for recording movements of

the intestine.

    2. When means are taken to eliminate its action on the heart, stimulation of

the peripheral cut end of the vagus is found not to influence the intestinal
movements (Dog, Cat).

     3. The splanchnics probably contain fibres causing both contraction and
dilatation of the intestine. Stimulation of the peripheral cut end usually causes
contraction rarely dilatation, never simple inhibition of movements.

                                                                ;

    4. The nerve roots which cause the maximum eflect on the intestine when

electrically stimulated are the 8th to 13th post-cervical.
      5. Intravenous injection of small doses of nicotine puts the nerve roots out of

action before the splanchnics ; there is probably, therefore, a cell station for these
fibres in the og^anglia of the chain.

   4. On the Effect of Peritonitis on Peristalsis. ^?/ A. S. Grunbauji,

                               M.A., M.B. (Cantab.), M.R.C.P.

     Peritonitis was excited in rabbits by the injection of turpentine and other
substances into the peritoneal cavity. The peristalsis was examined in the first
instance through the shaved abdominal wall, and subsequently, by opening ths
abdomen with the animal immersed in normal saline solution at 38° to 39° G.

     In the first twenty- four hours the peristalsis of both large and small intestine
was increased; it then gradually diminished untU complete paralysis resulted ia
about four days. The large intestine became paralysed before the small intestine.

                    5. The G'lucoside Constitution of Proteid Matter.

                      By F. W. Pavy, iV.D., LL.D., F.P.S.

     Glucosides have long been known to chemists as a class of bodies which by the
agency of ferments, or by the action of acids and alkalies, and even to a slight

extent of water at elevated temperatures, undergo a cleavage or disruption with a
carbohydrate as one of the products.

     Until recently it is only in connection with the vegetable kingdom that these
                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.             977;

todies have been recop^uised as existing, but it can now be said that it -will probably

be iound that they play an important part as constituents of the animal economy.
     They are met with as bodies presentinorallgradesof complexity of composition.

In some, of which salicin may be adduced as an example, only the three elements,

carbon, hydrogen, and oxj'gen are present. In others, of which amygdalin is an

example, the four elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, exist. In

myronic acid, a glucoside obtainable I'rom the seed of the black mustard, we have

the four elements that have been named, with the addition of sulphur. These are

bodies of comparatively simple composition, and from them advance can be made

to the complex bodies forming the basis of living matter. Mucin, found not only

in mucus, but forming also a constituent of connective tissue, was a short time ago

shown by Landwehr to fall in the category of glucosides. In my ' Physiology of

the Carbohydrates,' published in 1894, p. 27 ct seq., I supplied evidence showing

that proteid matter generally, alike of the animal and vegetable kingdoms of

nature, is in constitution a glucoside.

    As mentioned in the work referred to, I was led to this discovery in the
course of my quantitative examination of the various structures of the body for
glj"Cogen. The process I had for many years adopted consisted of dissolving by

boiling with potash, pouring into alcohol, collecting the precipitate, converting

into glucose with sulphuric acid, and titrating with the copper test. I had been

regarding the product derived from the structures as consisting of glycogen, but
I subsequently learnt that it was influenced in quantity by duration of the

exposure in contact with potash, and by the strength of the potash solution

employed.

     If glycogen only had constituted the source of the product obtained, the cir-
cumstances ought to have been otherwise. The treatment with potash should

have produced no eti'ect beyond dissolving the associated nitrogenous matter and

placing it in a position to be separable by the agency of the alcohol, and no

difl'erence in the amount of product obtained should have resulted from varjing

the strength of the alkali or the length of time of contact. The conclusion became

inevitable that there must be something besides glycogen to give rise to the result,
and the only feasible conclusion was that an amylose cai'bohydrate was derived

from a cleavage of the proteid molecule.

Having found that from a variety of proteids drawn from both animal and

vegetable sources I could obtain carbohydrate, evidently derivable from a breaking-
up of the proteid, and it is to be said in no insignificant amount, I took purified
egg albumen as a material for the further study of the subject.

    Summarily, it may be stated, as the result of this study, that by the agency of

potash an amylose carbohydrate, corresponding with Landwehr's animal gum, is

procurable, which is convertible by sulphuric acid into a body giving the various

characteristic reactions of sugar.

    By the direct action of sulphuric acid sugar at once is yielded, and the same

occurs as a result of pepsin digestion.

Details are given in full upon these points in my work, to which I have already

myreferred; and in  ' Epicriticism ' (Churchill, 1895) analytical evidence is sup-

plied from the laboratory of Mr. Ling, atfording conclusive proof that the osazone

obtainable from the product is a sugar osazone.

mySince the publication of  results I have found that they are to the fullest

extent corroborated by analytical experiments performed by the distinguished

chemist Schiitzenberger upwards of twenty years ago. Schiitzenberger studied the

products arising from the breaking- up of egg albumen by strong chemical agents,
and his paper on the subject is contained in the 'Bull, de la Soc. Chim. de Paris,'

vol. xxiii. (1875), p. 161.

     Speaking of the products derived from the treatment with sulphuric acid, he
mentions a non-azotised body which energetically reduced Fehling's solution, was

precipitable by the ammoniated acetate of lead solution, and which, in his own

words, ' parait etre de la glucose on un corps analogue.'

Again, after exposing egg albumen with baryta to 100° C. for 120 hours, he

obtained a non-azotised body, insoluble in alcohol, precipitable by the ammoniated
^78 REPORT--1896.

acetate of lead, not reducing Feliling's solution, but transformable by boiling with
sulphuric arid into a. body which does so. Its elementary composition was found
to be very close to that of dextrose, with which, remarks Schiitzenberger, it pre-
sents the greatest analogy. Evidently, he continues, there is a connection between
the body obtained in the experiments with baryta and the cupric oxide reducing
substance obtained in the experiments with sulphuric acid.

    My own experiments were started upon grounds totally different from those

which suggested the purely chemical investigation of Schiitzenberger. Sulphuric

acid was used in common by us, but baryta took the place of the potash used by

me. It is interesting to note the strict conformity traceable in the results, but

persons have failed to see the importance of Schiitzenberger's work, for till now all

the attention it has received is a passing allusion here and there to the bare facts

observed.

      That proteid matter, however, should thus constitute a glucoside is, I consider,
a point of the deepest physiological interest, and that such should be its nature
simply stands in harmony with what is to be learnt with respect to its formation.

     For instance, taking Pasteur's experiments on the growth of yeast, irrefutable
evidence is afforded that carbohydrate matter is appropriated in the construction
of proteid. Pasteur showed that yeast cells freely multiply in a medium consisting

of sugar, ammonium tartrate, the ash of yeast, and water. The growth that takes

place implies a growth of cell protoplasm, and with it a corresponding formation

of proteid matter. The ammonium nitrate, which contains no carbon, may be sub-
stituted for the ammonium tartrate, and then absolutely the only source for the

carbon of the proteid is the sugar that is present.
      Incorporated during its construction, the carbohydrate 9an be withdrawn, as I

have shown, from proteid matter by the cleaving power of chemical and ferment

action. The position we are thus placed in is this. The carbohydrate of our food

is in part applied to the construction of proteid matter, and in this locked-up state

may be conveyed to the tissues for their growth and renovation without running'

off as waste material through the kidney, as could not do otherwise than occur if it

were conveyed as sugar in a free form. From the proteid of the tissues it may be

cleaved off by ferment agency, and probably this is the source of the carbohydrate
found to be present to a certain extent in a free state in connection with the
various components of the body. There is no doubt that in the grave form of
diabetes the sugar eliminated is derived, not only from the food, but also from the
tissues, and the glucoside constitution of proteid matter fits in with and affords a
ready explanation of the state of things, ail that is wanted being the existence of
the requisite ferment agency.

6. The Discharge of a Single Nerve Cell. By Professor F. Gotch, F.B.S.

The electrical organ of Malapteimvus electricus ia innervated on each side by

the axis-cyUnder branches of a simple nerve cell. The response of the organ to

stimulation presents characteristics which can only be explained on the assump-

tion that it is the change in the nerve endings of these axis-cylinder branches. In

consequence of these two facts, the time relations of the organ response to reflex

stimulation afford groimds for deductions as to those of the single nerve cell dis-

charge by which the response is evoked. These time relations may be divided

into two classes : (1) The propagation time through the cell and its connections,

i.e. central delay                                                                                (2)  the periodicity of  the  excitatory changes  issuing from  the
                                                                                               ;

cell, i.e. reflex rhythm.

1. Experiments show with regard to the central delay, that it has a minimum

of "01 second. This delay is, in the opinion of the author, due to the character of

the structural path, which in the central mechanism consists of (a) fine axis-

cylinder branches of both affei-ent nerves and cell processes (b) an unknown
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

field of conjunction (e) the body of the nerve cell.

      In the efferent nerve branches a delay of '003 second exists both in muscles

and in electrical organs, which is termed the nerve ending excitatory delay. If

such delay, due to retarded propagation, is present in the central fine nerve
                                                                                                        --;

                                                                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                                  979

endings, then -006 second of the total time would be accounted for ; tlie remaining

time "would then be distributed over the other structures.
     2. The rhythm of the electrical reflex responses is a slow one in Malapterurus

with a maximal rate of 12 per second. Superimposed on this rhythm is a rapid
peripheral organ rhythm due to self-excitation, and in no way due to central

nervous discharge.

     The rate of 12 per second is not often met with, and a series of this type has
very few members, at most two or three. The most frecjuent rate is one of 4 per

second.

     The number of members of even this slower type is limited to from two to six.
     The experiments thus show that the single nerve cell discharge can occur at
12 per second, but that it generally occurs at slower intervals, and in all cases

rapidly fails.

     The contrast offered by these results to those of Torpedo, in which the central
rhythm varies from 100 to 30 per second, suggests that the latter owes its rapid
periodicity to the large number of nerve cells wliich innervate the Toi'pedo organ,

and which are thrown into successive activity.

1. On ike Principles of Microtome Construction. By Charles S. Minot,

      Professor at the Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

"With the advance of biology, particularly in the domains of embryology and

cytology, we have passed during the last twenty-five years through a complete

revolution of methods, with the result that the microtome has become as indispen-

sable as the microscope, and hence the construction of microtomes may fittingly

eccupy the attention of the Physiological Section of this Association.

The first object of a microtome is to make sections of even and known thickness

the second object is to make sections in large numbers of uniform thickness ; the
third object is to make sections rapidly. Finally, in recent years, there has been

a growing and justified demand for microtomes to make good sections of great

thinness, if possible not over one five-hundredth of a millimeter or two microns

(0'002 mm.). Now, sections which vary more than one-tenth from their supposed

thickness, can in the case of stained animal tissues be readily recognised by the

naked eye as uneven, hence, it is obvious that the thinner the section the less

must be the amount of absolute error in the cutting. For example, an error of 0'G02

mm. is the maximum admissible for sections of 0'002 mm. (500 to a millimeter),

though a much greater error would not be noticeable in sections of O'Ol ram.

Applied to the microtome this means that a roughly made instrument is sufficient

for thick sections, but the most perfect construction is necessary to secure a micro-

tome for fine cutting.

In the automatic microtome, worked by a revolving wheel, which I have

devised, and which is now made in England, Germany and France, as well as in

America, the attempt is made to secure mechanical perfection, and so far success-

fully that sections of 1/300 mm. may be made with it. The microtome is, how-

ever, adapted only to catting objects imbedded in paraffin. The model shown is

the latest American pattern, and has certain minor improvements which have

increased the accuracy and precision of the instrument.

   A second microtome was also shown, which is novel in construction, and is

suited for both paraffin and celloidine cutting. In designing this microtome

--precision was made the first object. The usual sources of error are (1) in the

bending of the knife                                                                               (2)  the yielding of the object to be cut, chiefly because  it is
                                                                                                ;

borne on an arm, which acts as a lever; (3) the 'jumping' of the sliding gear.

All these defects are at their maximum in the Eivet type of microtome, of which

the best known form is the Heidelberg or Thoma-Jung microtome. To obviate
these errors we have :

      1. Arranged to clamp tlie knife at both ends, either placed transversely
(parafBn cutting), or obliquely (celloidine cutting); also the knife is made very

heavy and of the chisel type, not of the razor type. It is known that the razor is

a worthless type for fine microtome knives, because the elasticity of the thin
blade introduces a gross error, except of course with very small and soft objects.

   We2. have provided a support for the object to be cut immediately under

the object itself, and this support is very wide, thus reducing the possible tilting to
an extreme minimum.

     3. To prevent jumping, the knife is kept immovable, the object alone moves,
and is clamped in the securest manner in the object-holder, while movable gibs

fasten the carriage to the ways.

     The apparatus includes two forms of movement, one of which is entirely
automatic, for raising the object. There are also simple devices for removing the
alcohol, when that is used for cutting, without any of the liquid falling on the
working gear. Other details need not be described, as they are mainly for con-
venience in use. In working out the construction of the microtome, 1 have had
the constant co-operation of Mr. Edward Bausch. His suggestions proved essential

to the success achieved.

    The microtome has been placed upon the market by Messrs. Bausch & Lomb,
of Rochester, New York. The price will probably be seventy to eighty dollars.

                 2. Fragments from the Autohiograj^hy of a Nerve.

                         By A. W. Waller, M.D., F.R.S.

   --Principle of method. The isolated living nerve is stimulated at regular

intervals and the series of electrical responses graphically recorded ; various
chemical reagents alter the character of the response. The nerve is practically
submitted to question and answer at regular short intervals, the question being
constant and the answer varying with the state of the nerve.

     The method lends itself to a large range of inquiries, such as the action of
anaesthetics, narcotics, sedatives, stimulantSj &c. Nerve-records were presented

exhibiting that

     1. Chloroform is more toxic than ether.
     2. Carbon dioxide is typically an anaesthetic.
      3. Nitrous oxide is inert.
     4. The basic is more effective than the acid moiety of a neutral salt. (Illus-
trated by records of potassium bromide, sodium bromide, potassium chloride.)

aconine, veratrine, curarine, digitaline.

                           By GusTAV Mann, M.D. Edin.

   --General MetJiod of Making Wax Models. (1) Fix in picro-con-osive fluid

(sp.gr. 1-020), take through alcohol and paraffin. (2) Make a complete series of
sections of known thickness. (3) Multiply the thickness by the magnifying
power used to ascertain the thickness of each wax plate to be used, e.g., thickness
of sections = 5 micromillimeters, the magnification = 1,000, therefore each section
to be represented by a wax plate 5,000 micromillimeters or o millimeters. (4) The
wax plates 1-2^ mm. thick, and for fine processes paper or cardboard soaked in
wax. (-5) With camera lucida make accurate outlines of all portions of cell and
and all processes whether of same cell to be represented or others. (6) The trans-
ferring paper for tracing outlines on the wax plates. (7) With sharp pointed knife

cut out cell and its processes, if the latter are detached from the body of the cell
leave them joined by strips of wax, which must be removed after fitting the various

sections togetlier. (8) Adjust wax plates in pairs, fix to one another by piercing
witii liot tools and continue this till cell built up. (9) Smooth outlines with hot

brass instruments and give final touches with a knife, controlling each touch by
carefully focussing in the microscope the level of the proximal and distal ends of

each process.

  --Some New Observations Obtained by t/iis Method. (1) The unipolar cells of

spinal ganglia and multipolar cells of sympathetic ganglia are spherical or oval in

the central parts of the ganglion and flattened parallel to the surface at the
peripherv of the ganglion. (2) The distal process of the bipolar cells from the
spinal ganglion of the guinea-pig is thinner than the proximal process. (3) The
cells from Clarks Column are frequently essentially bipolar, i.e., one axis cylinder
passes upwards and another downwards, while the dendritic processes are com-
paratively very few and insignificant. (4) The motor cells in the spinal cord have

winglike processes. (5) In Malapterurus the cell body appears much broken up,

because of the great development of the dendritic processes. Fritsch's idea of a
' Bodenplatte ' from which the axis cylinder is supposed to spring is erroneous.
Tliis method of studj'ing series of sections through the same cell has definitely
shown tliat sensory, motor, and sympathetic nerve cells all possess an essential
fibrillar structure, with chromatic granules lying between the fibrils.

K. Cell Granulatioyis under Normal and Abnormal Conditions, with special

  reference to the Leucocytes. By R. A. M. Buchanan, M.D., Liverpool.

      Classification of granules :

     1 Normal cells with granules.

      2. Granules of ingestion.
     3. Granulation associated with the life-history of the cell.

                (a) Pigment granules.

                   (6) Secretion granules.

               (c) Abnormal granules of degeneration.

                  (d) Specific granules of doubtful significance.

     Kanthack and Hardy's classification of leucocytes was used as a foundation.
     There is considerable evidence to show that the granules of leucocytes are of
definite formation, and analogous to secretion granules.
     They are not structural internodal points.
     In certain diseased conditions the granulation of one type of cell mav so alter

as to simulate another.

    Abnormal granulations may occur in the way of increase or decrease in amount

or size, and histo-chemical reaction.

     Leucocytes may be classified according to the histo-chemical reactions of their

--granules into two main groups (1) Oxyphile, and (2) Basophile.
      In the oxyphile group are included

            («) Finely granular oxyphile leucocytes.
            (b) Coarsely granular oxyphile leucocytes.
            (c) Myelocytes questionably.

      In the basophile group are included

      Hy"£(?) leucocytes }P'"«'^'^^1.^ basophile.

            (c) Finely granular basophile cells.
            {d) Coarsely granular basophile cells.

     Though definite distinctions exist in many ways between the members of each
main group there is evidence to show that they are closely interdependent, and

probably derivations from one definite ancestral group ; the differences arising
from environment, &c.
982 KEPORT-- 1896.

    In certain abnormal conditions either group may be affected separately or

together.

     Under abnormal conditions leucocytes are found exhibiting both oxyphile and

basophile granulation at one time.

             5. Some Points of Interest in Dental Histology.

                     By F. Paul, F.B.C.S., Liverpool.

The author sketched the development of teeth, and referred more in detail to

various imsolved points. In regard to the enamel organ he explained the cavities

or spaces frequently met "with near the dentine as due to uncalcified processes of

AHdentine matrix.  spaces or tubes in enamel were between and never within the

prisms, and were due to imperfect calcitication or absence of intercellular

substance. In regard to calcification of dentine and enamel, he thought that the

question of ' conversion or secretion ' had caused the essential difference in the

process as occurring in the two tissues to be overlooked. In enamel the change

occurred in comiection with the cells, whilst in dentine, as in other connective

Hetissues, the change was effected by the cells on the intercelhilar matrix.

believed tubular enamel to be more common than was supposed, since in appear-

ance it resembled dentine, though its tubular structure was due to a totally

different reason ; indeed, tubular enamel was a negative picture of tubular dentine,
the tubes being represented by the intercellular matter in enamel and by the cells

in dentine.

     Another point which has been raised in regard to the enamel organ was the
presence of blood-vessels in the enamel jelly. Professors Howes and Poulson have

stated that this structure in the rat was vascular. The author bad never yet seen

a vessel inside the enamel organ. He believed the contrary observation was a
mistake, and showed slides to explain how it might have originated. In some

animals the stellate-celled connective tissue of the sac is almost indistinguishable

I'rom the stellate cells of the enamel organ, whilst the condensed tissue of the

outer limit of the sac might easily be mistaken in small animals for the atrophying-

external enamel epithelium. This connective tissue is, of course, highly vascular,

and if assumed to be the enamel jelly would lead to the error.

The structure of Nasmyth's membrane was another moot point. It was, how-

ever, readily shown to be an epithelial tissue if unworn fresh teeth were placed

in a decalcifying phlorogluciu solution for a few minutes, washed, stained in

Ehrlich's acid hsematoxylin and washed again. On now peeling off and mounting

the loose bits of membrane in Tarrant's solution they would be found to show

epithelium with the nuclei well stained. Nasmyth's membrane was without

doubt a remnant of the external enamel epithelium.

6. The Effect of the Destruction of the Semicirctdar Canals upon the

      Movement of the Eyes. By Edgar Stevenson, M.D., Liverpool.

     The semicircular canals were destroyed on both sides in a small dog, an
interval of some weeks being made between the operations on each side. Com-
parison of the eye movements before and after one ear had been operated on
showed a very marked difference in the mobility of the eyes. The right ear was
first treated, and it was found that the right eye lost about three-quarters of its
power of movement in any direction, the permanent position of the eye being a
divergent squint, showing only very slight concomitant movements with- the other
eye. The results after the left ear had been operated on were even more
striking, for now both eyes lost almost altogether the power of movement, the
muscles supplied by the third nerve seeming to suffer most, a double divergent

squint being now produced. The movements before and after operation were

--tested both by observation the dog's head being held fast and food being passed

--in front of him in various directions and also grapliically by means of Professor

Knoll's iugeuious apparatus, by which ho recorded the eye movements in brain
anaemia. These observations may have some practical significance from the fact
that there are some cases on record of impairment of the movements of the eyes
in middle ear disease, and also from the fact that certain ophthalmic surgeons hold
that Meniere's disease, or auditory vertigo, is not due to a primary ear lesion, but
to defective balance of the extrinsic muscular innervation of the eye.

                           By Professor J. B. Haycraft.

2. The Physical Basis of Life. By Professor F. J. Allen, M.D. Cantab,

  --The most prominent function of living matter is what may be called Trading

in Energy i.e., the occlusion of radiant energy, storage thereof in the potential
form, and subsequent dispersion in the form of heat, mechanical work, &c.

     The explanation of this function is to be sought in the peculiar properties of
nitrogen. The most salient feature of nitrogen compounds is their liability to
change their constitution under slight variations in the energy equilibrium of their
surroundings. So wavering is the state of nitrogen under the conditions present
on our planet, that it may be called the Critical Element.

     The importance of caibon must not, however, be rmderrated. Its main function
is the storing of energy. In this function it is largely assisted by hydrogen.
Oxygen is the medium of exchange between the three other elements just

mentioned.

   HThe elements N, 0, C, and may be called the dynamic elements, because

they are the chief agents in the trade in energy; but their action may be

intimately dependent on the assistance of other elements present in living matter.
     The properties of living matter seem to indicate that

     1. Every vital phenomenon is due to a change in a nitrogenous compound, and
indeed in the nitrogen atoms of that compoimd.

     2. There is no vital action without transfer of oxygen, and the transfer is per-
formed by nitrogen (often assisted by iron).

     3. In the anabolic action of light on plants, the nitrogen compounds are afiected
primarily and the CO, and water secondarily,

     4. In the living and active molecule the nitrogen is centrally situated and often
in the pentad state. In the dead molecide it is usually peripheral and in the triad

state.

     5. The oxygen store of the living molecule is more or less united with the
nitrogen, but passes to some other element at death.

     6. The nitrogen of the living molecule is combined in a complex and perhaps
changeable manner, the compound resembling in some respects the cyanogen

compounds, in other respects the explosives such as nitroglycerine ; other analogies
are also traceable,
 984 nhPORT-- 180(5.

       In accounting for the first origin of life on tliis earth, tlie nitrogen theory does
 not require that the planet should have been at a former period, as Pfliiger
 suggests, ' a glowing fire-hall.' The author -[irefers to believe that the circum-
 stances which support life would also favour its origin.

      The theory may, however, be extended to the whole rmiverse. For, even if
 there be no other world where nitrogen is the critical element, yet other elements
 maybe in the critical state on the moon, or Mars, or the sun, or even in unknown
 and unimagined regions of the universe.

 4. The Organisatluii of Bacteriological Besearclt in Connection vnth Public

     Health. By Sim.s Woodiiead, M.D., Director of the Conjoint Labora-

      tories of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians, London.

      Dr. Woodhead pointed out that it was not an easy matter to define accurately
 where pure science ends and applied science be;j-ius, but he maintained that Pasteur,
 Lister, and Koch had all proved to demonstration that the most notable advances

 in our knowledge of the causes, prevention, and treatment of disease are extremely
·closely bound up with the increase in our knowledge of bacteriology, and he
 maintained that the practical needs in connection with the treatment and pre-
 Tentiou of disease had been the prime moving forces in determining the lines on
 which great scientific advances had been made in the subject of bacteriology.

 Anyone who had followed the Avork of Pasteu:-, Koch, and such investigators
 would be struck by the fact that in every instance the work carried on and the
 results obtained vv-ere the outcome of a desire to find a means of removing some
 specific evil which was either commercially or through the public health crippling
some section of the community. In the same way the development of the great
 principle of the antiseptic treatment of surgical wounds was the direct outcome
 of a desire on the part of Sir Joseph Lister to remedy those evils which had for

so long a period crippled surgery, especially in our large hospitals. Turning to
 the value of bacteriological research in public health questions, he spoke of the
work that had been done abroad in connection with the treatment of diphtheria,
tetanus, rabies, snake-bite, and numerous other diseases, and pointed out what
admirable work was being done in Government and municipally-supported foreign

laboratories. In this country we have numerous laboratories in all our large

Universities and University Colleges, but all are crippled by want of funds.
Speaking of the work that had been done hi this country, he mentioned the
pathological laboratories of University College, Liverpool, Owens College, Man-
chester, the British Institute of Preventive Medicine and the Laboratories of the
Conjoint Board of the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, London, where large
numbers of investigations had been going on, and at the same time numerous
questions concerning the public health, often raised by medical officers of he.alth,
had been worked out. In the University Colleges investigations on cholera, on
'typhoid, diphtheria, tuberculosis, and similar subjects had been carried on ; in the
Jiritish Listitute of Preventive Medicine similar work had been done, and various
antitoxic serums had been prepared and distributed to medical men, and several
most important questions connected with the bacteriology of water and sewage
had been investigated with most satisfactory results. In the laboratories of the
'(Conjoint Board, with the work of which he was of course more specially ac-
quainted, they had examined for the Metropolitan Asylums Board during last
year 11,.300 specimens from the throats of patients suspected to be suffering from
diphtheria, while they had already examined nearly 11,000 specimens during the
current year. They had prepared antitoxine for the treatment of these patients with
such satisfactory results that he was now in a position to state that, since the figures
f»ivea by their President in his opening address were published, in one hospital
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                         985

during the first six months of the year, and in one other, and probably two, during
the first eight months of the year, several hundreds of cases of post-scarlatinal
diphtheria had been treated without the occurrence of a single death, the early
diagnosis and the serum treatment combined bringing about this satisfactory

result. Dr. Woodhead proceeded to say that bacteriological laboratories were
hampered by want of funds, and were thus prevented from attaining their full
value to the community. Where assistance had been given from public authori-

ties, as in the case of the Royal Commission on tuberculosis, valuable results had

been achieved. Taking the laboratories of the University College, Liverpool, and
others, such as Owens College, Manchester, was not the cry there, ' Oh, that they

had funds with which they might assist or endow the men they had trained, and
who they knew were capable of turning out really good work ? ' On the other
hand, public health authorities were dependent in many respects upon the work of
such laboratories. Had not the time arrived for the two sets of authorities to

agree on some concerted line of action? Bacteriological laboratoriei existed for
the public good ; scientific men used them for the benetit of the community, but

the community had not realised the immense possibilities of the work. He

suo'o'ested that Coimty and City Councils should become patrons of research, as

they had in many cases become patrons of teaching. For a certain sum per

annum, suificieat to cover expenses and pay salaries, they should have the right,

through their medical officers, official veterinary surgeon?, or other officials or
committees, to submit for bacteriological examination material from hospitals, food

stuff's, milk, water, oysters, the carcasses of, or discharges from, animals suffering

from infectious diseases ; in fact, to call in for consultation the director and obtain
from him reports on any subject in which bacteriological examination might be

deemed necessary. He would go even further than this, as he maintained that in

the present state of the antitoxine question, taking that as an example of the work
that had been done for the benefit of the community, it was absolutely necessary that
addition to large central laboratories which should be devoted to the testing of the

various antitoxic serums offered for sale, there should be facilities in all bacterio-

 logical laboratories for the examination of any of the serums that had already been
distributed. This opened up a very large question, but it was one which had to

be faced, and the sooner that this was recognised the better for all concerned.

       5. Bacteria and Food. By A. A. Kanthack, M.D.

  --The author stated that (1) The quantitative bacteriological analysis is inade-

quate, since sound food frequently, if not generally, contains as many micro-

organisms as suspected or condemned food. This is well illustrated by the results

obtained from an examination of milk, sandwiches, oysters, and ice-creams. (2)

The qualitative examination of food is also of comparatively little value, since in
sound food all the species of bacteria may be found which occur in suspected or

in unsound food. Two organisms which have been specially singled out as proof

against the soundness or integrity of food are the Bacterium coli commune and
proteus forms. The significance of these microbes is more fully discussed, and the

view that the Bacterium coli implies f^cal or sewage contamination is assailed.

These two organisms occur in food, because their distribution is almost ubiquitous.

The Bacterium coli is present in the intestines and in faeces because it is ubiquitous,

and it is illogical to assume that its presence outside the digestive track signifies

direct faecal or filth contamination. (3) Lastly, the question of obligatory and

facultative symbiosis is touched upon, and the question of adaptation between man
and bacteria is raised. Many plants do not thrive in sterile surroundings ; it is

possible that Pasteur's opinion, expressed in 1885, that animals would do badly

without the assistance of bacteria, may prove to be correct.

    It is well that we should know the bacterial flora of good and unsuspected food,
and become familiarised with the idea that many articles of food generally
consumed teem with bacteria, described by many bacteriologists as characteristic

of faecal or decomposing matter.

     The relations between the various cell-layers were pointed out, and the probable
nath of the nervous impulses indicated. The final ramifications, under the micro-
scope, appeared to be in anatomical contact, thus getting over the difficulty of
physiological action at a distance. Certain new cells were described, and an
explanation given of certain granules, seen long ago by Dr. Hill in the molecular
la\er by the aid of Golgi's method.

2. TlbC Basis of the Bacteriological Theory, founded upon Observations

also described the quantity of the bacteria present in this filtrate, and discussed the
question of their origin.

   4-. The Presence of Iron and of Copper in Green and in White Oysters.

                        By Charles A. Kohn, Ph.D., B.Sc.

      The object of the experiments undertaken is to show whether the gi'een colour
 of the gills of certain types of French oysters {Huitres des Marennes) is due to iron,
 which (Jhatin and Muntz regard as the cause of the colouration. Electrolytic
 methods of analysis were employed, as these offer special advantages for the deter-
 mination of minute quantities of metals when derived from organic matter. The
 results show that white oysters contain quite as much iron, both in their gills and

  in the rest of their bodies, as green oysters ; and, further, that the quantity of iron
  ]>vesent in the gills of green oysters is not proportionately sufficient to attribute

 t!ie colouration to its presence. The total quantity of iron found in French, Dutch,
  and American oysters varied from 1 -8 to 4-0 milligrammes per six oysters.

       Copper is also a normal constituent of both green and of white oysters, but
  the amount present in the gills of the former is quite insufficient to account for

 --their colour. Although iron may be a constituent of the green colouring matter,

  it is certainly not the cause of the colouration a conclusion confirmed by Professor
  Herdman's experiments, in which he showed that no colouration was produced by

 and vaccinia, and, as an outcome of this, on fliu question of the purification and
 preservation of vaccine lymph.

      Vaccine lymph as ordinarily obtained and stored is apt to contain, in addition
 to the specific veins, certain microbes, of which some, when inoculated in the act
 of vaccination, are liable to be productive of dangerous complications. It was
 shown, however, in the Transactions of the Congress of Hygiene for 1891, that this
difficulty could be avoided by the admixture with the lymph material of an equal
((uantity of a 50 per cent, solution of pure glycerine in water, prior to storage in

capillary tubes. When this process ia adopted, and the tubes kept protected from

the liglit for a period of from two to six weeks, it is found, after this lapse of time,
that gelatine plates made from such tubes remain absolutely sterile. The lymph,

liowever, is still perfectly active as vaccine, the specific virus being able to with-

stand the action of the glycerine.
      In view of the publication of the ILeport of the Royal Commission on Vaccina-

tion, it appeared to be desirable to investigate more accurately the action of glyce-
rine on various micro-organisms of a pathogenic or non-pathogenic nature respec-

--tively.
     MethoH. This has been done by the addition of known quantities of glycerine
to tubes of beef-peptone broth, which are subsequently inoculated with equal
quantities of pure cultivations, and incubated at blood-heat and at the room tem-

perature respectively. Control inoculations in ordinary beef broth have also

invariably been employed. Subsequently an inoculation is made from the broth-
tubes on to solid media, at varying intervals of time, in order to see whether the
particular microbe is still capable of growth, or not. In all, some hundreds of
inoculations have been made thus far, and the paper includes a table in which are
given the maximum limits of substance attained in the different series. Practi-
cally, the results of each similar series were found to agree very closely.

     The micro-organisms employed for the inoculations comprised Staphylococcus
pyogenes aureus, S. pyogenes albus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus pyocyaneus, B.
subtilis, B. coli communis, B. dipht/terice and B. tuberculosis. Small-pox and vac-

--cine material in the form of 'crusts ' and lymph was also employed.
    Results. 1. No visible development of the micro-organisms employed takes

place in the presence of more than 30 per cent, of glycerine.
      2. All the micro-organisms experimented with are killed out in less than a

month in the presence of from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, glycerine, with the ex-
ception of B. coli communis and B. subtilis, when kept in the cold.

     3. B. coli communis, unlike B. typhosus, resists the action of 60 per cent,
glycerine, in the cold, for a considerable period, a fact which is likely to prove a
valuable addition to our present methods of difl'erentiating these microbes from one

another.

     4. Small-pox and vaccine material, whether as * crusts ' or lymph, are sterilised
completely, so far as extraneous microbes are concerned, in a week by the presence
of glycerine t(^ the extent of 40 per cent, in the broth-tubes.

6. Some Points in the Mechanism of Reaction to Peritoneal ^Infections.

    By Herbert E. Durham, Gull Research Student, Bacteriological

     Laboratory, Guy's Hospital.

      Shortly after intra-peritoneal injections of various substances (guinea-pigs),
there is a remarkable disappearance of the wandering cells normally present in the

peritoneal fluid. Three kinds of wander cells, or leucocytes, are found in normal

--peritoneal fluid viz., hyaline cells, coarsely granular oxyphil, or 'megoxyphil'

cells as it is proposed to call them, and lymphocytes. The above disappearance
Jitiects the hyaline and megoxyphil cells ; the lymphocytes remain.

     For the period of the paucity of cells in the fluid, the term leucopenia or

Icncopenic stage, proposed by Lowit, may be applied.

     The onset of leucopenia is described to be instantaneous by Kantback, and
Hardy, and by Issaefl'. The author's observations in more thian 200 in.stances

                                                                                              3s2
                                                                                       '

988 REPORT-- 1896.

(guinea-pig's) show that the onset is never less than 5 minutes after injection.
The time of onset varies somewhat according to the nature and temperature of the

injected fluid.

     Metschnikoif, and Kantback, and Hardy attribute the leucopenia to a sudden

destruction of the cells. Metschnikoif considers that this solution of cells (' pha-

golyse') imbues the peritoneal fluid with increased bactericidal power.

    The author does not agree with these statements ; first, because the cells may
he found again during the leucopenic stage, and secondly because when inert

resistance substances {e.g., carbon particles) are introduced, they disappear in
considerable proportion at the same time as the cells. His observations are con-
sequently in accordance Avith those of Mesnil on the leucopenia which occurs after

intra-vascular injections this observer has shown that the cells are stopped by

                    --;

adhesion to capillary walls more particularly in the liver. At the beginning of
the year (Wiener klin. Wocbenschr Nos. 11 and 12, 1896), it was shown by Prof.

Gruber, and the author, that large numbers of the cells become depodted vpon the
omentum, thougrh some become adherent to other parts of the peritoneal lining

after intra-peritoneal injections.

     The mechanism of this deposit appears to be as follows: the hyaline and

megoxyphil cells adhere together into masses or ' balls '; these 'balls ' are driven

by the peristaltic, and other abdominal movements, to the omentum and upper

region of the cavitj% where they become adherent. In animals killed at recent
periods after intra-peritoneal injection, the peristaltic movements are exceptionally

active.

At the same time numljers of bacteria, in the case of infections, also hecome

deposited on the omentum, etc. ; especially if some serum having a ' clumping

action has been mixed with the bacterial emulsion. By the use of Indian ink the

phenomenon may be demonstrated to the naked eye by removing samples with

capillary tubes. By the action of the abdominal movements the omentum becomes

rolled   up                  it  is  also  intensely injected  in  acute  infections.  Soluble substances,
                          ;

such as carmine, or potassium ferrocyanide solutions, have a predilection for the

omentum apparently independently of the leucocytes. It is suggested that possibly

bacterial toxins may be dealt with to some extent in this manner.

The leucopenic stage lasts about an hour, when a cell normally foreign to the

peritoneal cavity (the finely granular oxyphil (K. and H.) or ' microxypbil ' cell,

or polynuclear leucocyte) makes its appearance. The period of leucopenia has been

called a ' period of negative chemiotaxis' by Issaeft'; however, especially with

microbes of a comparatively low degree of virulence, very active phagocytosis is

estahlished by the hyaline cells ; these cells ingest the microbes without any pre-

liminary intervention on the part of the megoxyphil cells ; the microbes attached

to the hyaline cells may be almost countless, whilst many of the megoxyphil
cells are free from or at any rate only have a few attached microbes. One indu-

bitable instance of phagocytosis by megoxycytes has been observed.
      Metschnikoft" states that ' phagolyse ' does not occur after injections during the

leucocytotic condition induced by an injection {e.g., pepton-broth) given twenty-four
hours previously. The author does not agree with this statement, for he finds that

the cells then present (microxypbil cells and macrophages) ^baW together, and
disappear by adhesion to the peritoneal linings, in a manner similar to that which

occurs in normal (previously untreated) animals. This has been demonstrated to
the naked eye by giving coloured injections {e.g., Indian ink, or carmine granules)
during the leucocytotic period, and seeing the disappearance of the coloured
material from capillary samples ; also by marking the cells by previous injections

(e.g., peptonate of iron, carmine, etc.), and watching their disappearance. The
disappearance can also be traced by care after bacterial inoculations ; but owing to
the abundance of cells, only a proportion of which disappear, the observation is
less readily made than when coloured materials are used. The ' increased re-
sistance^ first identified by Issaelf, obtained by producing a leucocytosis by means

of simple injections, is suggestive of being of great practical value in the treat-

ment of peritoneal cases in man, where there is some risk of infection (perityphilitic,
pelvic abscesses, &c.), if operation is undertaken: these points will be more fully

discussed elsewhere in conjunction with a number of observations on peritonitis in

man.

  --Another factor in the production of leucopenia remains to be discussed the

action of the lymph paths. The lymph paths from the peritoneal cavity have

received scant attention in the past : recently Starling has observed that the

lymph vessels in the anterior mediastinum become filled with coloured material at
remote periods after injection of similar material into the peritoneal cavity. The

first observation of the author was made in December 1894. It was found that
carbon particles began to reach the lymph glands, situated in the first intercostal

space (guinea-pigs and rabbits), in eight minutes after injection. Solutions (car-

mine, pot. ferrocyanide) pass up more rapidly, and these upper glands were filled

in three minutes. Though absorption may take place in other regions of the
peritoneal lining, and other lymph paths may be utilised, the course through

diaphragmatic lymphatics to the vessels and glands of the anterior mediastinum,

and so to the blood-vessels, is par excellence the route of peritoneal lymph absorp-

tion. Bacteria, and cells are carried along these paths from the peritoneal cavity.

Bacteria have been seen in the lymph vessels of the diaphragm, and falciform

ligament six minutes after injection. Bacteria have been found in the blood

capillaries of the liver within half an hour of intra-peritoneal injection. The
process is therefore both rapid and early. In man the same lymph paths have

been found aflected in acute and in chronic (tuberculous, malignant) peritonitis

they should always be examined in peritonitic cases. In a case of ruptured tubal

gestation these lymphatics were beautifully injected with blood, and could readily

be traced into the root of the neck.

     Though microxyphil cells do not become free in the peritoneal fluid till about
an hour after experimental injections, they begin to make invasion much earlier.

In animals killed six to eight minutes after injection the capillaries of the mesen-

tery (especially) are becoming blocked with microxycytes. These cells wander

out of the vessels, and eventually through the peritoneal endothelium. Their

invasion is associated with an increase in the amount of peritoneal fluid, followed

(about sixteen to twenty hours) by diminution of fluid in recovering cases.

     The megoxyphil cells do not invade the cavity in significant numbers ; they

may be almost absent, and are variable and inconstant in numbers.

     The microxyphil cells, and macrophages, on the other hand, come in such
Jarge numbers in all recovering cases that they must be considered of much signi-

ficance, in the question of the battle against the microbes.

The presence of microxycytes (and macrophages) in the peritoneal fiuid is

associated with an increase of bactericidal power of the fluid {vide Hahn's similar

Aobservations with pleural fluid), apart from phagocytosis.   combination ot

cellular and humoral theories is necessary for the explanation of the processes of

reaction in peritoneal infection.

     The rapidity with which the lymph paths are brought into action, and with

which intra-vascular changes commence, is an argument against a too rigid theory

·of coelomic and htemal white corpuscles.

There would appear to be a definite peritoneal circulation of cells and fluid

from (especially the mesenteric) blood-vessels to the anterior mediastinal lymph-

xes3els, almost from the moment after intraperitoneal injection, until the normal

condition has been re-established.

The observations upon which these statements are based, were made in Pro-

fessor Qruber's laboratory in Vienna, and the Bacteriological Laboratory of Guy's

Hospital.

7. On the Agglutinating Action of Human Seruvx on certain Pathogenic
    Micro-organisms {particularly on the Typhoid Bacillus). By Albert

     S. Grunbaum, M.A., M.B. (Cantab.), M.R.C.P.

     The serum of an animal immunised against the typhoid bacillus or other motile
pathogenic micro-orgfinism has a peculiar action on an emulsion (in bouillon) of
the bacillus of the corresponding disease. If a drop of serum and a drop of
                                                          --'

 emulsion be mixed, and examined under the microscope, the bacilli will be seen
 to collect together in clumps, and to lose their motility. This reaction is nearly
 specific, and can be used to differentiate or identify certain bacteria. The pheno-
 menon, although noticed by Bordet, was first thoroughly studied and its import-

 ance recognised by Durham and Gruber. The latter termed the active conglome-

 rating substances ' agglutiniues,' and they seem to play an important part in
  immunisation.

      The serum of normal guinea pigs or rabbits does not, as a rule, cause any reac-

 tion. Human serum is very different in this respect. In a comparatively large

 percentage of individuals (particularly those affected with jaundice) the serum has
 a very distinct agglutinating action on the cholera, coli, and typhoid bacilli,
 generally more on one than on the other. But the action is so little specific that,

 in normal individuals, it may be equal on any two or on all three. This does not

 occur with the serum of immunised animals.

      But the strength of action is incomparably smaller with human serum. That

 of a highly immunised animal can be diluted to one in a thousand or more, and

 still show a clumping effect, that of man hardly ever more than one in eight.
      Only in cases of typhoid fever (and the action is here much more specific) does

 it react in a dilution of one to sixteen (or more). Heiice the reaction can be used for
purposes of diagnosis. The agglutination is sometimes more marked with the
 diluted than with the pure serum, possibly through there being separate substances

 for the inhibition of movement and the agglutination. Individuals who have

 had typhoid fever do not, apparently, preserve any excess of typhoid ' agglutiniues
 in their serum for any great length of time.

       Agglutiniues present in the maternal blood are not necessarily present in the

child's blood (at birth) ; the former may react strongly, and the latter not at all.
 But in this case, and generally in man, the immunising power seems to be only

 very partly dependent on the agglutinating power of the serum.

   8. The. Detection of Lead in Organic Fluids. By John Hill Abram,
          M.D. (Lond), M.R.C.P., and Prosper H. Marsden, F.C.S.

                   [From the Pathological Laboratory, Univ, Coll., Liverpool.]

      In the usual methods adopted for the detection of lead in organic fluids, the
organic matter is destroyed by means of hydrochloric acid and chlorate of potash,
and the solutions or precipitates obtained are then subjected to the ordinary tests,

or preferably, as Dr. Kohn has shown, to electrolysis.
     With regard to the organic fluids (urine, vomit), with which we (the writers)

have more particularly to deal. Dr. Kohn states that the destruction of the organic
matter by HCl and KCIO3 may be omitted, as the quantity thereof in urine, &c.,

is small, this is a great gain, and electrolysis is both delicate and accurate.
     One of us whilst reading von Jaksch's book on Clinical Diagnosis, was struck

by a simple method there described. It is not there claimed by vou Jaksch, nor
is any reference given, and so far no reference to the process has been discovered
by us.

     Von Jaksch states that to detect lead the fluid should be partially evaporated

on the water bath and the organic matter decomposed, thus apparently not

--relying on the method to be described.
     The details given are as follows: 'A strip nf magnesium, free from lead, is-
placed in the fluid, when metallic lead will be deposited upon it, and can then be

dissolved in nitric acid and confirmatory tests applied to the solution.'

    We have modified the test slightly by adding ammonium oxalate in the

proportion of 1 grm. to 150 c.c. of fluid, and by using acetic acid as the solvent.

We have found the addition of the oxalate to be a great advantage, and we have

to thank Dr. Kohn for the suggestion.
    Coloration is seen on the magnesium within an hour, but we have usually

allowed the strip to remain for 24 hours. The magnesium is then taken out,
washed with distilled water, and the following confirmatory tests applied :

     2. The lead is dissolved oft' with acetic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen passed
through the solution.

     The magnesium strips can of course be used repeatedly, after carefully washing
with acid and distilled water. The method is at bottom an electrolytic one, but
its simplicity, and so far as our experiments go, its accuracy strongly Tecommend

it to clinicians.

     There is no necessity for any special apparatus, and the actual working time

may be safely put as less than one hour.
    In aqueous solution we have obtained results when lead has been present in

the proportion of 1 part in 50,000.

    The results have been equally good in urine. Clinically we have found lead

in the urine of two cases under the care of one of us in the Royal Infirmary, and
in the vomit from one case.

Keeper of the Jodrell Laboratory, Royal Gardens, Kew.

                  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.

The Pkesident delivered the following Address :

                  Present Position of Morphological Botany.

The object of modern morphological botany (the branch of our science to which
I propose to limit my remarks) is the accurate comparison of plants, both living

and extinct, with the object of tracing their real relationships with one another,

and thus of ultimately constructing a genealogical tree of the vegetable king-

dom. The problem is thus a purely historical one, and is perfectly distinct

from any of the questions with which physiology has to do.

Yet there is a close relation between these two branches of biology; at any

rate, to those who maintain the Darwinian position. For from that point of view
we see that all the characters which the morphologist has to compare are, or

have been, adaptive. Hence it is impossible for the morphologist to ignore the

functions of those organs of which he is studying the homologies. To those

who accept the origin of species by variation and natural selection there are no

such things as morphological characters pure and simple. Tliere are not two

--distinct categories of characters a morphological and a physiological category

for all characters alike are physiological. ' According to that theory, every

organ, every part, colour, and peculiarity of an organism must either be of benefit

to an organism itself, or have been so to its ancestors. . . . Necessarily, according

to the theory of natural selection, structures either are present because they are

whomselected as useful, or because they are still inherited from ancestors to  they

were useful, though no longer useful to the existing representatives of those ancestors.'

The useful characters may have become fixed in comparatively recent times, or

a long way back in the past. In the latter case the character in question may

have become the property of a large group, and thus, as we say, may have become

morphologically important.

For instance, parasitic characters, such as the suppression of chlorophyll, are

equally adaptive in Dodder and in the Fungi. In Dodder, however, such cha-

racters are of recent origin and of little morphological importance, not hinder-

ing us from placing the genus in the natural order Convolvulacese while in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

Fungi equally adaptive characters have become the common property of a great

class of plants.

Then, again, the existence of a definite sporophyte generation, which is the

great character of all the higher plants, is in certain Fungi inconstant, even among

members of the same species.

Although there is no essential difference between adaptive and morphological

                  ' Lankester, Adrance7ne7it of Science, p. 307.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  993

characters, there is a great difference in the niorphologist's and the physiologist's

·n-ay of looking at them. The physiologist is interested in the question how
organs work ; the inorphologist asks, what is their history ?

    The morphologist may well I'eel discouraged at the vastness of the work before

him. The origin of the great groups of plants is perhaps, after all, an insoluble

problem, for the question is not accessible either to observation or experiment.

    All that we can directly observe or experiment upon is the occurrence of varia-

--tions perhaps the most important line of research in biology, for it was the study

of variation that led Darwin and Wallace to their grand generalisation. Many

observers are working to-day in the spirit of the great masters, and it is certain
that their work will be fruitful in results. It is evident, however, that such
investigations can at most only throw a side light on the historical question of the
origin of the existing orders and classes of living things. The morphologist has

to attack such questions by other methods of research.
     The embryological method has so far scarcely received j ustice from botanists.

A great deal of what is called embryology in botany is not embryology at all,

--but relates to pre-fertilisation changes. Of real embryology that is to say, the
--development of the young plant from the fertilised ovum there is much less than

we might expect. Thus no comparative investigation of the embryology of either

Dicotyledons or Monocotyledons has ever been carried out, our knowledge being

entirely based on a few isolated examples.
     In the cases which have been investigated perhaps excessive attention has been

devoted to the first divisions of the ovum, the importance of which, as Sachs long
ago showed, has been overrated, while the later stages, when the differentiation

of organs and tissues is actually in progress, have been comparatively neglected.
     The law of recapitulation (or repetition of phylogeny in ontogeny) has been

very inadequately tested in the vegetable kingdom. Whatever its value may be,

it is certainly desirable that the development of plants as well as animals should
be considered from this point of view ; and this has so far been done in but very

few cases. M. Massart, of Brussels, has made some investigations with this object

on the development of seedlings and of individual leaves. He is led to the con-

clusion that examples of recapitulation are rare among plants.'

     So far, at least, embi-yological research has only yielded certain proof of re-
capitulation in a few cases, as in the well-known example of the phyllode-bearing
acacias, in which the first leaves of the seedling are normal, while the later formed

ones gradually assume the reduced phyllode form.

   A less familiar example is afforded by Gunnera. Here, as is well known, the

mature stem has a structure totally different from that of ordinary Dicotyledons,

and much resembling that characteristic of most Ferns. In most species of
Gunnera there are a number of distinct vascular cylinders in the stem, instead of

one only, and there is never the slightest trace, so far as the adult plant is con-
cerned, of the growth by means of cambium, which is otherwise so general in the

class. The seedling stem, however, is not only monostelic below the cotyledons,
but in this region, though nowhere else, shows distinct secondary growth. Thus,
if we were in any doubt as to the general affinities of Gunnera, owing to its
extraordinary mature structure, we should at once be put on the right track by the

study of Ihe embryonic stem, which alone retains the characteristic dicotyledonous

mode of growth.

      It is only in a few cases, however, and for narrow ranges of affinity, that the

doctrine of recapitulation has at present helped in the determination of relationships

among plants. Beyond this, conclusions based on embryology alone tend to
become merely conjectural and subjective. In fact, all comparative work, in so
far as it is limited to plants now living, suffers under the same weakness

that it can never yield certain results, for the question whether given characters

are relatively primitive or recently acquired is one upon which each naturalist is

left to form his own opinion, as the origin of the characters cannot be observed.

     To determine the blood-relationships of organisms it is necessary to decipher
 their past history, and the best evidence we can have (when we can get it) is from
 the ancient organisms themselves. The problem of the morphologist is an

 historical one, and contemporary documentary evidence is necessarily the best. It
 is palaeontology alone which can give us the real historical facts.

                                        Anatomical Chaeactees.

     In judging of the affinities of fossil plants we are often compelled to make
 great use of vegetative characters, and more particularly of characters drawn
 from anatomical structure. It is true that in many cases we do so because we

 cannot help ourselves, such anatomical features being the only characters available

 in many of the specimens as at present known. But the value of the method has
 been amply proved in other cases where the reproductive structures have also

 been discovered, and are found to fully confirm the conclusions based on anatomy.
 I need only mention the great groups of the Lepidodendreae and the Calamites, in

 each of which the anatomical characters, when accurately known, put us at once
 on the right track, and lead to results which are only confirmed by the study of

 the reproductive organs

     In this matter fossil botany is likely to react in a beneficial way on the study

 of recent plants, calling attention to points of structure which have been passed
 over, and showing us the value of characters of a kind to which systematists had

 until recently paid but little attention. At present, owing to the work of

 Radlkofer, Vesque, and others, anatomical characters are gradually coming into

 use in the classification of the higher plants, and in some quarters there may even

 be a tendency to over-estimate their importance. Such exaggeration, however, is
 only a temporary fault incident to the introduction of a comparatively new
 method. In the long run nothing but good can result from the effort to place our
 classification on a broader basis. In most cases the employment of additional

 characters will doubtless serve only to further confirm the afiinities already

 detected by the acumen of the older taxonomists. There are plenty of doubtful
 points, however, where new light is much needed ; and even where the classifica-
 tion is not affected it will be a great scientific gain to know that its divisions are
 based on a comparison of the whole structure, and not merely on that of particular

 organs.

      The fact that anatomical characters are adaptive is undeniable, but this applies

 to all characters, such difference as there is being merely one of degree. Cases

 are not wanting wliere the vegetative tissues show greater constancy than the
 organs of reproduction, as, for example, in the Marattiaceas, where there is a
 great uniformity in anatomical structure throughout the family, while the
 sporangia show the important differences on which the distinction of the genera is

 based. It is in fact a mistake to suppose that anatomical characters are neces-

 sarily tlie expression of recent adaptations. On the contrary, it is easy to cite
 examples of marked anatomical peculiarities which have become the common

 property of large groups of plants.
      For instance, to take a case in which I happen to have been specially interested,

 the presence of bast to the inside as well as to the outside of the woody zone is a
 modificcation of dicotyledonous structure which is in many groups, at least of
 ordinal value. The peculiarity is constant throughout the orders Onagraceffl, Ly-
 thraceae, Myrtaceae, Solanaceae, Asclepiadacese, and Apocynaceae, not to mention
 some less important groups. In other families, such as the Cucurbitaceae and the
. Gentianeae, it is nearly constant throughout the order, but subject to some exceptions.

 Among the Compositae a similar, if not identical, peculiarity appears in some ot

 the sub-order Cichoriaceae, but is here not of more than generic value. In C'mnpa-

 mda the systematic importance of internal phloem is eveu less, for it appears in some

 species and not iu others. Lastly, there are cases in which a similar character
  actually appears as an individual vaiiation, as in Caruin Carvi, and, under abnor-
 mal conditions, in Phaseolus multiflonis.

      These latter cases seem to me worthy of special study, for in them we caa

trace, under our very eyes, the f.rst rise of anatomical characters which have else-

Awhere become of high taxonomic importance.  comparative study of the anatomy

of any group of British plants, taking the same species growing under different

conditions, would he sure to yield interesting results if any one had the patience to

undertake it.

Enough has been said to show that a given anatomical character may be of a

high degree of constancy in one group while extremely variable in another, a fact

which is already perfectly familiar as regards the ordinary morphological charac-

ters. For example, nothing is more important in phanerogamic classification than

the arrangement of the floral organs as shown in ground-plan or floral diagram.

Yet Professor Trail's observations, which he has been good enough to communicate

to me, show that in one and the same species, or even individual, of Polygonum,

almost every conceivable variation of the floral diagram may be found.

There is, in fact, no ' royal road ' to the estimation of the relative importance

of characters ; the same character which is of the greatest value in one group may

be trivial in another ; and this holds good equally whether the character be drawn

from the external morphology or from the internal structure.

Our knowledge of the comparative anatomy of plants, from this point of view,

is still very backward, and it is quite possible that the introduction of such charac-

ters into the ordinary work of the Herbarium may be premature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      certainly it must

Webe conducted with the greatest judgment and caution.        have not yet got our

data, but every encouragement should be given to the collection of such data, so

that our classification in the future may rest on the broad foundation of a com-

parison of the entire structure of plants.

In estimating the relative importance of characters of different kinds we must

not forget that characters are often most constant when most adaptive. Thus, as

Professor Trail informs me, the immense variability of the flowers of Polygomini

goes together with their simple method of self-fertilisation. The exact arrange-

ment is of little importance to the plant, and so variation goes on unchecked. In

flowers with accurate adaptation to fertilisation by insects such variability is not

found, for any change which would disturb the perfection of the mechanism is at

once eliminated by natural selection.

               Histology.

I propose to say but little on questions of minute histology, a subject which

lies on the borderland between morphology and physiology, and which will be

dealt with next Tuesday far more competently than I could hope to treat it. Last

myyear  predecessor in the presidency of this Section spoke of a histological dis-

covery (that of the nucleus, by Robert Brown) as ' the most epoch-making of

events ' in the modern history of botany. The histological questions before us at the

present day may be of no less importance, but we cannot as yet see them in proper

perspective. The centrosomes, those mysterious protoplasmic particles which have

been supposed to preside over the division of the nucleus, and thus to determine

the plane of segmentation, if really permanent organs of the cell, would have to

rank as co-equal with the nucleus itself. If, on the other hand, as some think,

they are not constant morphological entities, but at most temporary structures

differentiated ad hoc, then we are brought face to face with the question whether

the causes of nuclear division lie in the nucleus itself or in the surrounding

protoplasm.

     Nothing can be more fascinating than such problems, and nothing more difficult.

We have, at any rate, reason to congratulate ourselves that English botanists are

no longer neglecting the study of the nucleus and its relation to the cell. For a

long time little was done in these subjects in our country, or at least little was

published, and botanists were generally content to take their information from

abroad, not going beyond a mere verification of other men's results. Now we

have changed all that, as the communications to this Section sufficiently testify.

Nothing is more remarkable in histology than the detailed agreement in the

structure and behaviour of the nucleus in the higher plants and the higher
996 KEPORT-- 1896.

animals, an agreement which is conspicuously manifest in those special divisions
which take place during the maturation of the sexual cells. Is this striking agree-

ment the product of inheritance from common ancestors, or is the parallelism

dependent solely on similar physical conditions in the cells ? This is one of the

great questions upon which we may hope for new light from the histological dis-

cussion next week.

                                    Alternation of Geneeations.

     "VVe have known ever since the great discoveries of Hofmeister that the develop-
ment of a large part of the vegetable kingdom involves a regular alternation of

--two distinct generations, the one, which is sexual, being constantly succeeded so far
--as the normal cycle is concerned by the other which is asexual. This alternation

is most marked in the mosses and I'erns, taking these words in their widest sense,
as used by Professor Campbell in his recent excellent book. In the Bryophyta,
the ordinary moss or liverwort plant Ts the sexual generation, producing the ovum,
which, when fertilised, gives rise to the moss-fruit, which here alone represents the
asexual stage. The latter forms spores from which the sexual plant is again

developed.
      In the Pteridophyta the alternation is equally regular, but the relative develop-

ment of the two generations is totally different, the sexual form being the insigni-
ficant prothallus, while the whole fern -plant, as we ordinarily know it, is the

asexual generation.

     The thallus of some of the lower Bryophyta is quite comparable with the pro-
thallus of a fern, so as regards the sexual generation there is no difficulty in seeing

the relation of the two classes ; but when we come to the asexual generation or

sporophyte the case is totally different. There is no appreciable resemblance
between the fruit of any of the Bryophyta and the plant of any vascular
Cryptogam.

      There is thus a great gap within the Archegoniatae ; there is another at the
base of the series, for the regular alternation of the Bryophyta is missing in the

Algae and Fungi, and the question as to what corresponds among these lower
groups to the sporophyte and oophyte of the higher Cryptogams is still disputed.

    Now as regards this life-cycle, which is characteristic of all plants higher than

Algae and Fungi, there are two great questions at present open. The one is
general: are the two generations, the sporophyte and the oophyte, homologous
with one another, or is the sporophyte a new formation intercalated in the life-
history, and not comparable to the sexual plant ? The former kind of alternation

has been called homologous, the latter antithetic. This question involves the
origin of alternation ; its solution would help us to bridge over the gap between

the Archegoniatae and the lower plants. The second problem is more special :
has the sporophyte of the Pteridophyta, which always appears as a complete plant,
been derived from the simple and totally different sporophj'te of the Bryophyta, or
are the two of distinct origin ?

     At present it is usual, at any rate in England, to assume the antithetic theory

of alternation. Professor Bower, its chief exponent, says:^ 'It will also be

assumed that, whatever may have been the circumstances which led to it, anti-

thetic alternation was brought about by elaboration of the zygote [i.e. the fertilised
ovum] so as to form a new generation (the sporophyte) interpolated between suc-
cessive gametophytes, and that the neutral generation is not in any sense the result
of modification or metamorphosis of the sexual, but a new product having a distinct
phylogenetic history of its own.' In his essay on ' Antithetic as distinguished from
Homologous Alternation of Generations in Plants,'- the author describes the hypo-
thetical first appearance of the sporophyte as follows : ' Once fertilised, a zygote
might in these plants [the first land plants] divide up into a number of portions
(carpospores), each of which would then serve as a starting-point of a new indi-

vidual.'

On this view, the sporophyte first appeared as a mere group of spores formed

by the division of the fertilised ovum. Consequently the inference is drawn that

all the vegetative parts of the sporophyte have arisen by the 'sterilisation of

potentially sporogenous tissue.' That is to say, there was nothing but a mass of

spores to start with, so whatever other tissues and organs the sporophyte may form

must be derived from the conversion of spore-forming cells into vegetative cells.

Professor Bower has worked out this view most thoroughly, and as the result he

is not only giving us the most complete account of the development of sporangia

which we have ever had, but he has also done much to clear up our ideas, and to

show us what the course of evolution ought to have been if the assumptions

required by the antithetic theory were justified.

Without entering into any detailed criticism of this important contribution to

morphology, which is still in progress, I wish to point that we are not, after all,

bound to accept the assumption on which the theory rests. There is another view

myin the field, for which, in  opinion, much is to be said. The antithetic theory is

receiving a most severe test at the friendly hands of its chief advocate Should it

break down under the strain we need not despair, for another hypothesis remains

which I think quite equally worthy of verification.

This is the theory of Pringsheim, according to which the two generations are

homologous one with another, the oophyte corresponding to a sexual individual

among Thallophytes, the sporopliyte to an asexual individual. To quote Prings-

heim's own words : ' ' The alternation of generations in mosses is immediately

related to those phenomena of the succession of free generations in Thallophytes,
of which the one represents the neutral, the other the sexual plant.' Further on '

he illustrates this by saying : ' The moss sporogonium stands in about the same

relation to the moss plant as the sporangium-bearing specimens of Saprolegnia

stand to those which bear oogonia, or as, among the Florideae, the specimens with

tetraspores are related to those with cystocarps.' This gets rid of the intercalation

of a new generation altogether ; we only require the modification of the already

existing sexual and asexual forms of the Thallophytes.

The sudden appearance of something completely new in the life-history, as

myrequired by the antithetic theory, has, to  mind, a certain improbability.  Ex'

Wenihilo nihil Jit.  are not accustomed in natural history to see brand-new

structures appearing, like morphological Melchizedeks, without father or mother.

Nature is conservative, and when a new organ is to be formed it is, as every one

knows, almost always fashioned out of some pre-existing organ. Hence I feel a

certain difficulty in accepting the doctrine of the appearance of an intercalated

sporophyte by a kind of special creation.

VVe can have no direct knowledge of the origin of the sporophyte in the Bryo-

phyta themselves, for the stages, whatever they may have been, are hopelessly lost.

In some of the Algfe, however, we find what most botanists recognise, as at least a

parallel development, even if not phylogenetically identical.^ In CEdoyoinum, for

example, the oospore does not at once germinate into a new plant, but divides up

into four active zoospores, which swim about and then germinate. In Coleochcete

the oospore actually becomes partitioned up by cell-walls into a little mass of

tissue, each cell of which then gives rise to a zoospore.

In both these genera (and many more might be added) the cell-formation in.

the germinating oospore has been generally regarded as representing the formation,

of a rudimentary sporophyte generation. If we are to apply the antithetic theory

of alternation to these cases, we must assume that the zoospores produced on ger-

mination are a new formation, intercalated at this point of the life-cycle. But is

this assumption borne out by the facts ? I think not. In reality nothing new is

intercalated at all. The ' zoospores ' formed from the oospore on germination are

identical with the so-called ' zoogonidia,' formed on the ordinary vegetative plant at

all stages of its growth.

In science, as in every subject, we too easily become the slaves of language.

--998 REPORT 1896.

By pivinff things different names we do not prove that the things themselves are
mydifferent. In this case, for example, the multiplication of terms serves, in

opinion merely to disguise the facts. The reproductive cells produced by the
ordinary plant'of an CEdogoriium are identical in development, structure, behaviour,
and germination with those produced by the oospore. The term 'zoogonidia' applied
to the former is a ' question-begging epithet,' for it assumes that they are not
homologous with the ' zoospores ' produced by the latter. I prefer to keep the old

name zoospore for both, as they are identical bodies.

    To my mind the point seems to be this. An (Edoffonium (to keep to this

example) can form zoospores at any stage of its development ; there is one particu-

--lar stage, however, at which they are always formed namely, on the germination

of the oospore. Nothing new is intercalated, but the irregular and indefinite

succession of sexual and asexual acts of reproduction is here tending to become

regular and definite.
     In Spheeroplea, as was well pointed out by the late Mr. Vaizey,i though his

view of alternation was very different from that which I am now putting forward,
the alternation is as definite as in a moss, for here, so far as we know, zoospores

are only formed on the germination of tlie fertilised ovum. If Sphceroplea stood

alone we mio-ht believe in the intercalation of these zoospores, as a new stage, but

the comparison with Vlothri.r, CEdogomum, Bulbochate and Coleochccte shows, I

think, where they came from.
     The body formed from the oospore is called by Pringsheim the first neutral

o-eneration. In (Edogonium this has no vegetative development, for the first thing
that the oospore does is to form the asexual zoospores, and it is completely used up
in the process. In other cases it is not in quite such a hurry, and here the first
neutral generation has time to show itself as an actual plant. This is so in Ulothrix,

a much more primitive form than (Edogonium, for its sexuality is not yet com-
pletely fixed. Here the zygospore actually germinates, forming a dwarf plant, and
in this stage passes through the dull season, producing zoospores when the weather
becomes more favourable. On Pringsheim's view the dwarf plant is not a new

creation but iust a rudimentary Ulothrix, which soon passes on to spore-formation.
So too with the cellular body formed on the germination of the oospore

of Coleochcete ; this also is looked upon as a reduced form of thallus. On any
view this genus is especially interesting, for the sporophyte remains enclosed by

the tissue of the sexual generation, thus offering a striking analogy with the

Bryophyta.

   --In the Phycomycetous Fungi plants wbich have lost their chlorophyll, but
--which otherwise in many cases scarcely differ from Algfe the oospore in one and

the same species may either form a normal mycelium, or a rudimentary mycelium
bearin<^ a sporangium, or may itself turn at once into a sporangium (producing

zoospores) without any vegetative development. Here it seems certain that
Prinfsheim's view is the right one, for all stages in the reduction of the first neutral
generation lie before our eyes. Nowhere, either here or among the green Algre,
do I see any evidence for the intercalation of a new generation or a new form of
spore on the germination of the fertilised ovum.

      Pringsheim extends the same view to the higher plants. The sporogonium
of a moss is for him the highly modified first neutral generation, homologous with
the vet^etative plant, but here specially adapted for spore-formation. I have
 elsewhere pointed out - that this view has great advantages, for not only does it
harmonise exactly with the actual facts observed in the green Algre and their allies,
 but it also helps us to understand the astoundingly different forms which the
archegoniate sporophyte may assume.

     It seems to me that Pringsheim was right in regarding the fruit-formation of

 Florideje as totally different from the sporophyte-formation of Coleochcete or the
 Bryophyta. The cystocarp bears none of the marks of a distinct generation, for
 throucrhout its whole development it remains in the most complete organic connec-

knowledge there seems to be no real parallelism with the formation of a sporophyte

in the higher plants.

     The gap between the Bryophyta and the Algfe remains, unfortunately, a wide
and deep one, and it is not probable that any Alg£e at present known to us lie at
all near the line of descent of the higher Cryptogams. Riccia is often compared
with Coleoducte, but it is by no means evident that Riccia is a specially primitive

form. In Ai/t/ioceros, which bears some marks of an archaic character, the sporo-
phyte is relatively well developed. To those who do not accept the theory of

intercalation it is not necessary to assume that the most primitive Bryophyta must
have the most rudimentary sporophyte.

     Apart from other differences, Bryophyta differ from most green Algse in the

fact that asexual spores are only found in the generation succeeding fertilisation.
The spores moreover are themselves quite different from anything in Algee, and
the constancy of their formation in fours among all the higher plants from the
liverworts upwards, is a fact which requires explanation. I should like to sug-

mgest to some energetic histologist a comparison of the details of spore-formation
    the lower liverworts and in the various groups of Algae, especially those of the
green series. It is possible that some light might be thus thrown on the origin of

tetrad-spore-formation, a subject as to which Professor Farmer has already gained

some very remarkable results. On Pringsheim's view some indications of homo-

logy between bryophytic and algal spore-formation might be expected, and any-

how the tetrads require some explanation,

The peculiarities of the sporophyte in the Archegoniatae, as compared with any

algal structures, depend, no doubt, on the acquirement of a terrestrial habit, while

the oophyte by its mode of fertilisation remains ' tied down to a semi-aquatic life.'

Professor Bower's phrase ' amphibious alternation ' expresses this view of the case

very happily, and indeed his whole account of the rise of the sporophyte is of the

highest value, even though we may not accept bis assumption as to its origin
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "^
de novo.

      I attach special weight to Professor Bower's treatment of this subject,

mbecause he has shown how the most important of all morphological phenomena

   plants, namely the alternation of generations in Archegoniatae, may be explained
as purely adaptive in origin. All Darwinians owe him a debt of gratitude for

this demonstration, which holds good even if we believe the sporophyte to be the
modification of a pre-existing body, and not a new formation.

   We must remember that the theory of homologous alternation has twice

received the strongest confirmation of which a scientific hypothesis is susceptible--
that of verified prediction. In both cases Pringsheim was the happy prophet.
Convinced on structural grounds of the homology of the two generations iii
mosses, he undertook his experiments on the moss-fruits, in the hope, as he says,^ that
he would succeed in producing protonema from the subdivided seta of the mosses
and thus prove the vwrphological agreement of seta and moss-stem. His experi-
ment, as everybody knows, was completely succcessful, and resulted in the first
observed cases of apospory, i.e. the direct outgrowth of the sexual from the asexual

generation.

     Ilexe he furnished his own verification ; in the second case it has come from
other hands. In the paper of 1877, so often referred to, he says (p 391) · ' Here

however [i.e. in the ferns], the act of generation, that is, the formation of sexual
organs and the origin of an embryo, is undoubtedly bound up with the existence

my preliminary notice, in which the prothallus will sprout forth directly from the

frond.'

It is unnecessary to remind English botanists that Pringsheim's hypothetical

aposporous  ferns  are  now perfectly well  known  in  the flesh                                    such  cases having
                                                                                                 ;

been first observed by Mr. Druery and then fully investigated by Professor

Bower.

   A very remarkable case of direct origin of the oophyte from the sporophyte has

lately been described by Mr. E. J. Lowe, in a variety of Scolopendrium vuhjare.

Here the young fern-plant produced prothalli bearing archegonia as direct out-
growths from its second or third frond. The specimen had a remarkable history,
for the young plants were produced from portions of a prothallus which had been
kept alive and repeatedly subdivided during a period of no less than eight years.

I cannot go into the interesting details here, they will be published elsewhere

but I wish to call attention to the fact that in this case the production of the sexual

from the asexual generation, occurring so early in life, has no obvious relation to
suppressed spore-formation, and so appears to differ essentially from the cases first

described, which occurred on mature plants. I believe Mr. Lowe's case is not an

-- --altogether isolated one.
     The converse phenomenon that of apogamy or the direct origin of an asexual
plant from the prothallus without the intervention of sexual organs, has now been
observed in a considerable number of ferns, the examples already known belonging

to no less than four distinct families : Polypodiacese, Parkeriacete, Osmundacese,
and Hymenophyllacefe. In Trichomanes alatum Professor Bower found that
apospory and apogamy co-exist in the same plant, the sporophyte directly giving

rise to a prothallus, which again directly grows out into a sporophyte ; the life-

cycle is thus completed without the aid either of spores or of sexual organs. Dr.

W. H. Ijang who has recently made many interesting observations on apogamy,
will, I am glad to say, read a paper on the subject before this section, so I need say

no more.

   Imust, however, express my own conviction that the facility with which, inferos,
the one generation may pass over into the other by vegetative growth, and that in

both directions, is a most significant fact. It shows that there is no such hard and
fast distinction between the generations as the antithetic theory would appear to

demand, and in my opinion weighs heavily on the side of the homology of sporo-

phyte and oophyte. I cannot but think that the phenomena deserve greater attention

from this pomt of view than they have yet received.

   A mode of growth which affords a perfectly efficient means of abundant propa-

gation cannot, I think, be dismissed as merely teratological.

     Since the foregoing paragraph was first written Dr. Lang has made the remarli-
able discovery (already communicated to the Royal Society) that in a Lustraa
sporangia of normal structure are produced on the prothallus itself, side by side

with normal archegonia and antheridia. I cannot forbear mentioning this striking

observation, of which we shall hear an account from the discoverer himself.

     The strongest advocate of the homology of the prothallus with the fern plant

could scarcely have ventured to anticipate such a discoveiy.

Goebel said, in 1882 : ' The gap between the Bryophyta and the Pteridophyta is
Wethe deepest known to us in the vegetable kingdom.
                                                       must seek the starting-

point of the Pteridophyta elsewhere than among the Muscinese : among forms which

may have been similar to liverworts, but in which the asexual generations entered

from the first on a different course of development.' I cannot help feeling that

all the work which has been done since goes to confirm this wise conclusion.

Attempts have been made in the most sportsmanlike manner (to adopt a phrase of

Professor Bower's) to effect a passage over the gulf, but the gulf is still unbridged.

I cannot see anywhere the slightest indication of anything like an intermediate

form between the spore-bearing plant of the Pteridophyta and the spore-bearing

fruit of the Bryophyta. The plant of the Pteridophyta is sometimes small and
simple, but the smallest and simplest seem just as unlike a bryophytic sporogonium
sfi the largest and most complex. On the side of the moss group, Antkoceros has
been often cited as a form showing a certain approach towards the Pteridophytes,
and Professor Campbell in particular has developed this idea with remarkable in-

genuity. An unprej udiced comparison, however, seems to me to show nothing more

here than a very remote parallelism, not suggestive of affinity.

    There is no reason to believe that the Bryophyta, as we know them, were the

precursors of the vascular Cryptogams at all. There is a remarkable paucity of

evidence for the geological antiquity of Bryophyta, though many of the mosses at
any rate would seem likely to have been preserved if they existed. Brongniart
said, in 1849, ' The rarity of fossil mosses, and their complete absence up to now
in the ancient strata, are among the most singular facts in geological botany ; ' -
and since that time it is wonderful how little has been added. Things seem to
point to both Pteridophyta and Bryophyta having had their origin far back
among some unknown tribes of the Algae. If we accept the homologous theory
of alternation, we may fairly suppose that the sporophyte of the earliest Pterido-
phyta always possessed vegetative organs of some kind. The resemblance between
the young sporophyte and the prothallus in some lycopods indicates that at some
remote period the two generations may not have been very dissimilar. At least

some such idea gives more satisfaction to my mind than the attempt to conceive

of a fern-plant as derived from a sterilised group of potential spores.

     The Bryophyta may have had from the first a more reduced sporophyte, the

first neutral generation having, in their ancestors, become more exclusively adapted

to spore-producing functions. I must not omit to mention the idea that the
Bryophyta, or at any rate the true mosses, are degenerate descendants of higher
forms. The presence of typical stomata on the capsule in some cases, and of
somewhat reduced stomata in others, has been urged in support of this view. It
is possible ; but if so, from what have these plants been reduced ?

    Few people, perhaps, fully realise how absolutely insoluble such a problem as

Tve have been discussing really is. I say nothing as to the mosses, which mat/
have arisen relatively late in geological history. The Pteridophyta, at any rate,

are known to be of inconceivable antiquity. Not only did they exist in greater

development than at present in the far-off Devonian period, but at that time they
were already accompanied by highly organised gymnospermous flowering-plants.

Probably we are all agreed that Gymnosperms arose somehow from the vascular

Cryptogams. Hence, in the Devonian epoch, there had already been time not only
for the Pteridophyta themselves to attain their full development, but for certain
·*mong them to become modified into complex Phanerogams. It would not be a
rash assumption that the origin of the Pteridophyta took place as long before the

period represented by the plant-bearing Devonian strati as that period is before

our ovm day. Can we hope that a mystery buried so far back in the dumb past

will be revealed ?

      It will be understood that I do not wish to assume the role of partisan for the

homologous theory of alternation. Possibly the whole question lies beyond human
ken, and partisanship would be ridiculous. But I do wish to raise a protest

against anything like a dogmatic statement that alternation of generations viust

Jiave been the result of the intei-polation of a new stage in the life-history. Let

us, in the presence of the greatest mystery in the morphology of plants, at least

keep an open mind, and not tie ourselves down to assumptions, though we may

·use them as working hypotheses.

                   Histological Characters of the two Generations.

     There is one histological question upon which I must briefly touch, becaue* it

bears directly on the subject which we have been considering. I shall say Teiy

little, however, in view of the discussion next Tuesday.

1002  REPORT-- 189G.

    It is now well known that in animals and in the higher plants a lemaikable

numerical change takes i)lace in the constituents of the nucleus shortty before the
act of fertilisation. The change consists in the halving of the number of chromo-
somes, those rod-like bodies which form the essential part of the nucleus, and are

re'1-arded by Weismann and most biologists as the bearers of hereditary qualities.
Thus in the lily the number of chromosomes in the nuclei of vegetative cells is

twenty-four ; in the sexual nuclei, those of the male generative cell and of the ovum,

the number is twelve. When the sexual act is accomplished the two nuclei unite,

and so the full number is restored and persists throughout the vegetative life of
the next generation. The absolute figures are of course of no importance ; the
point is, the reduction to one half during the maturation of the sexual cells, and
the subsequent restoration of the full number when their union takes place. I say
nothinir as to the details or the significance of the process, points which have
been fully dealt with elsewhere, notably in an elaborate recent paper by Miss E.

Sargaut.

    Now, in annuals (so far as I am aware) and in angiospermous plants the reduc-

tion of the chromosomes takes place very shortly before the differentiation of the
sexual cells. Thus in a lily the reduction takes place ou the male side immediately

prior to the first division of the pollen mother-cell, so that four cell-divisions in all
intervene between the reduction and the final differentiation of the male generative

cells. On the female side the reduction in the same plant takes place in tht-

primary nucleus of the embryo-sac, so that here there are three divisions between
the reduction and the formation of the ovum. I believe these facts agree very
closely with those observed in the animal kingdom, and so far there is no par-

ticular difficulty, for we can easily understand that if the number of chromosomes

is to be kept constant from one generation to another, then the doubling involved

in sexual fusion must necessarily be balanced by a halving.
     There are, however, a certain number of observations on Gymuosperms and

archegoniate Cryptogams which appear to put the matter in a different light.

Overton ' first showed that in a Cycad, Ceratozamia, the nuclei of the prothallus or
endosperm all have the half-number of chromosomes. Here then the reduction
takes place in the embryo sac (or rather its mother-cell), but a great number of
cell-generations intervene between the reduction and the maturation of the ovum.

In fact the whole female oophy te shows the reduced number, while the sporophy te

has the full number. The reduction takes place also in the pollen mother-cell.
Further observations have extended this conclusion to some other Gymnosperms.

    In Osmunda among the ferns there is evidence to show that reduction takes

place in the spore mother-cell, and that the sexual generation has the half-number

throughout. Professor Farmer has found the same thing in various liverworts,

and shown that the reduction of chromosomes takes place in the spore mother-ceU;
and his observations of cell-division in the two generations have afforded some
direct evidence that tbe oophyte has the half-number and the sporophyte the full

number throughout. Professor Strasburs/er fully discussed this subject before

Section D at Oxford," and came to the conclusion that the difference in number

of chromosomes is a difference between the two generations as such, the sexual
generation being characterised by the half-number, the asexual by the full number.

     The importance of this conception for the morphologist is that an actual
Iiistological difference appears to be established between the two generations ; a
fact which would appear to militate agaiust their homology. Some botanists even
go 80 far as to propose making the number of chromosomes the criterion by which
the two generations are to be distinguished. Considering that the whole theory
rests at present on but few observations, I venture to think this both premature
and objectionable ; for nothing can be worse for the true progress of science than

to rush hastily to deductive reasoninsr from imperfectly established premises.

    The facts are certainly very difficult to interpret. Those who accept the

antithetic theory of alternation suppose the sexual generation to be the older, and

Hence they believe that in Thallophytes the plant should show throughout

the reduced number of chromosomes, reduction hypothetically takiuc ])lace

immediately upon the germination of the oospore. If this were true it Mould lend

some support to the idea of the intercalation of the sporophyte, but at present there

is not the slightest evidence for these assumptions. On the contrarj-, in the only

oogonium, immediately before the maturation of the ova, and on sexual fusion the

full number is restored, to persist throughout the vegetative life of the plant.

Fucus is, no doubt, a long way off the direct line of descent of Archegoniatto, but

still it is a striking fact that the only direct evidence we have goes dead against

the idea that the sexual generation (and who could call a Fucus-plant anything

else but sexual ?) necessarily has the reduced number of chromosomes. Tliis fact

is indeed a rude rebuff to deductive morphology.

I am disposed to regard the different number of chromosomes in the two

generations observed in certain cases among Archegoniatje not as a primitive but

as an acquired phenomenon, perhaps correlated with the definiteness of alternation

in the Archegoniatae as contrasted with its indefiniteness in Thallophytes. In

Fucus, in flowering plants, and in animals the soma or vegetative body has the full

number of chromosomes. With these the sporophyte of the Archegouiatae agrees

it is the oophyte which appears to be peculiar in possessing the half-number,

so that if the evidence points to intercalation at all, it would seem to suggest that

--the oophyte is the intercalated generation obviously a reductio ad absurdum.

I do not think we are as yet in a position to draw any morphological conclusions

from these minute histological differences, interesting as they are.

The question how the number of chromosomes is kept right in cases of

apospory and of apogamy is obviously one of great interest, and I am glad to say

that it is receiving attention from competent observers.

                                    Sexuality op Fungi,

Only a few years ago De Bary's opinion that the fruit of the ascus-beanng

Fungi is normally the result of an act of fertilisation was almost universally

accepted, especially in this country. Although the presence of sexual organs had

only been recorded in comparatively few cases, and the evidence for their functional

activity was even more limited, yet the conviction prevailed that the ascocarp is at

least the homologue of a sexually produced fruit. The organ giving rise to the

ascus or asci was looked upon as homologous with the oogonium of the

Peronosporese, the supposed fertilising organ either taking the form of an

antheridial branch as in that group, or, as observed by Stahi in the lichen Collema,

giving rise to distinct male cells, or spermatia. More recently there has been

a complete revolution of opinion on this point, and a ^ear ago or less most

botanists probably agreed that the question of the sexuality of the Ascomycetes

had been settled in a negative sense. This change was due, in the first place, to

the influence of Brefeld, who showed, in a great number of laborious investigations,

that the ascus-fruit may develop without the presence of anything like sexual

organs                              while Moller proved that the  supposed male cells of lichens are in a
                                 ;

multitude of cases nothing but conidia, capable of independent germination.

The view thus gained ground that all the higher Fungi are asexual plants,

fertilisation only occurring in the lower forms, such as the Peronosporeje and

Mucorineae, which have not diverged far from the algal stock. The ascus, in

particular, is regarded by this school as homologous with the asexual sporangium of

a Mucor. This theory has been brilliantly expounded in a remarkable book by

Von Tavel, which we cannot but admire as a model of clear morphological

reasoning, whether its conclusions be ultimately adopted or not.

Still, it must be admitted that the Brefeld school were rather apt to ignore

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             3l'2

such pieces of evidence as militated against their views, and consequently their
position was insecure so long as these hostile posts were left uncaptured.

     Quite recently the whole question has been reopened by the striking observa-
tions of Mr. Harper, an American botanist working at Bonn.

     Zopf, in 1890,' pointed out tb it up to that time it had not been possible in any
Ascomycete to demonstrate a true process of fertilisation by strictly scientific
evidence, namely, by observing the fusion of the nuclei of the male and female

elements. Exactly the proof demanded has now been afforded by Mr. Harper's

observations, for in a simple Ascomycete, Sphcerotheca castagnei, the parasite
causing the hop-mildew, he has demonstrated in a manner which appears to be
conclusive the fusion of the nucleus of the antheridiuin with that of the ascogo-
iiium.* It is impossible to evade the force of this evidence, for the fungus in
question is a perfectly typical Ascomycete, though exceptionally simple, in so far as
only a single ascus is normally produced from the ascogonium. It is unnecessary

to point out how important it is that Mr. Harper's observations should be con-
 firmed and extended to other and more complex members of the order. In the
mean time the few who (unlike your President) had not bowed the knee to Brefeld
may rejoice

      It is impossible to pursue the various questions which press upon one's mind in
considering the morphology of the Fungi. The occurrence not only of cell-fusion,

 but of nuclear fusion, apart from any definite sexual process, now recorded in

 ^veral groups of Fungi, urgently demands further inquiry. Such unions of nuclei
 have been observed in the basidia of Agarics, the teleutospores of Uredineae, and
 even in the asci of the Aacomycetes. That such a fusion is not necessarily, as
 Dangeard ' has supposed, of a sexual nature, seems to be proved by the fact that
 it occurs in the young ascus of Splxerotheca long after the true act of fertilisation

 has been accomplished. It is possible, however, that these phenomena may throw

 an important side-light on the significance of the sexual act itself.

     Another question which is obviously opened up by the new results is that of

 the homologies of the ascus. The observations of Lagerheim * on Dipodascus point
 to the sexual origin of a many-spored sporangium not definitely characterised as
 an ascus, On the other hand, not only sporangia, but true asci are known to arise
 in a multitude of cases direct from the mycelium. It is of course possible that as
 regards the asci these are cases of reduction or apogamy ; on the other hand, it is
 not wholly impossible that the asci may turn out to be really homologous with a
 se\.ual sporangia, even though their development may often have become associated
 with the occurrence of a sexual act. However this may be, there is at present no
 reason to doubt that a very large proportion of the Fungi are, at least functionally,

  se.xless plants.

      Among the most striking results of recent years bearing on the morphology of

 the higher plants, Treub's discovery of the structure of the ovule and the mode of
 fertilisation in Casuarina must undoubtedly be reckoned. The fact that the

  pollen-tube in this genus does not enter the micropyle, but travels through the
  tissues of the ovary to the chalaza, thus reaching the base of the embryo-sac, was

  remarkable enough in itself, and when considered in connection with the presence
  of a large sporogenous tissue producing numerous embryo-sacs, appeared to justify
  the separation of this order from other angiosperms. Then came the work of Miss
  Benson in England, and of Nawaschin in Russia, showing that these remarkable
  peculiarities are by no means confined to Casuarina, but extend also in various
  modifications to several genera of the Cupuliferae and Ulmacese. They are not,
  however, constant throughout these families, so that we are no longer ableto
  attach to these characters the same fundamental systematic importance which

  their first discoverer attributed to them. It is remarkable, however, that these

departures from the ordinary course of angiospermous development occur in

families some of which have been believed ou other grounds to be among the most

primitive Dicotyledons.

                  Evidence of Descent deeived from Fossil Botany.

     At the beginning of this Address I spolie of the importance of the comparative!}
direct evidence afforded by fossil remains as to the past history of plants. It may

Ije of interest if I endeavour to indicate the directions in which such evidence
seems at present to point.

     It was Brongniart who in 1828 first arrived at the great generalisation that

* nearly all of the plants living at the most ancient geological epochs were
Cryptogams,' ' a discovery of unsurpassed importance for the theory of evolution,

though one which is now so familiar that we almost take it for granted. Thoee

palfBOzoic plants which are not Cryptogams are Gymnosperms,for the angiospermous
flowering plants only make their appearance high up in the secondary rocks.
Even the AVealden flora, recently so carefully described by Mr. Seward, one of
the secretaries to this section, has as yet yielded no remains referable to Angio-

sperms, though this is about the horizon at which we may expect their earliest

trace to be found.
     Attention has already been called to the enormous antiquity of the higher

--Cryptogams the Pteridophyta-- and to the striking fact that they are accompanied,

in the earliest strata in which they have been demonstrated with certainty, by
well-characterised Gymnosperms. The Devonian flora, so far as we know it,
though an early, was by no means a primitive one, and the same statement applief
still more strongly to the plants of the succeeding Carbonifeious epoch. The
palaeozoic Cryptogams, as is now well known, being the dominant plants of their

time, were in many ways far more highly developed than those of our own age

and this is true of all the three existing stocks of Pteridophyta, Ferns, Lycopods,
and Equisetinese.

   We cannot, therefore, expect any direct evidence as to the origin of the^e groups

from the palaeozoic remains at present known to us, though it is, of course, quite

possible that the plants in question have sometimes retained certain primitive
characters, while reaching in other respects a high development. For example, the
general type of anatomical structure in the young stems of the Lepidodendrese was
simpler than that of most Lycopods at the present day, though in the older trunks
the secondary growth, correlated with arborescent habit, produced a high degree of

complexity. On the whole, however, the interest of the palaeozoic Oiyptogams

does not consist in the revelation of their primitive ancestral forms, but rather in
their enabling us to trace certain lines of evolution further upward than in recent

plants. From the Carboniferous rocks we first learn what Cryptogams are capable
of. In descending to the early strata we do not necessarily trace the trunk of the
genealogical tree to its base ; on the contrary, we often light on the ultimate twigs
of extensive branches which died out long before our own period.

    In a lecture which I had the honour of giving last May before the Liverpool
Biological Society, I pointed out how futile the search for ' missing links ' among

fossil plants is likely to be. The lines of descent must have been so infinitely
complex in their ramification that the chances are almost hopelessly great against

our happening upon the direct ancestors of living forms. Among the collateral
lines, however, we may find invaluable indications of the course of descent.

      Fossil botany has revealed to us the existence in the Carboniferous epoch of a

-- --fourth phylum of vascular Cryptogams quite distinct from the three which have

come down more or less reduced to our own day. This is the group of

Spbenophylleae, plants with slender ribbed stems, superposed whorls of more or less
wedge-shaped leaves, and very complex strobUi with stalked sporangia. The
group to a certain extent combines the characters of Lycopods and Horsetails,
resembling the former in the primary anatomy, and the latter, though remotely, in

external habit and fructification. Like so many of the early Cryptogams, Spheno-

phijlluni possessed well-uiarked cumbial frrowth. One may hazard tLe guess that
this interesting group may have been derived from some unknown form lying at

the root of both Calamites and Lycopods. The existence of the Sphenophyllese
certainly suggests the probability of a common origin for these two series.

     In few respects is the progress made recently in fossil botany more marked
than in our knowledge of the affinities of the Calamarieas. Even so recently as

the publication of Count Solms-Laubach's unrivalled introduction to ' Fossil
Botany,' the relation of this family to the Horsetails was still so doubtful that the
author dealt with the two groups in quite difl'ei'ent parts of his book. This is
never likely to happen agaiu. The study of vegetative anatomy and morphology
on the one hand, and of the perfectly preserved fructifications on the other, can

leave no doubt that the fossil Calamarieee and the recent Equiseta belong to one

and the same great family, of which the palaeozoic representatives are, generally

speaking, by tar the more highly organised. This is not only true of their

anatomy, which is characterised by secondary growth in thickness just like that of
a Gymnosperm, but also applies to the reproductive organs, some of which are
distinctly heterosporous. In the genus Ccdamostachys we are, I think, able to trace

the first rise of this phenomenon.
     The external morphology of the cones is also more varied and usually more

complex than that of recent Equiseta, though in some Carboniferous forms, as

in the so-called Calamostachys tenumima of Grand' Eury, we find an exactly

Equisetum-like arrangement.

    The position of the Sigillariae as true members of the Lycopod group is now

well established. The work of Williamson proved that there is no fimdamental

distinction between the vegetative structure of Lepidodendron, which has always

been recognised as lycopodiaceous, and that of Sigillaria. Secondary growth in

thickness, the character which here, as in the case of the Calamodendreas, misled
Brongniart, is the common property of both genera. Then came Zeiller's dis-

covery of the cones of Sujillaria, settling beyond a doubt that they are hetero-

Asporous Cryptogams.  great deal still remains to be done, more especially as to

the relation of Stigmaria to the various types of lycopodiaceous stem. At present

we are perhaps too facile in accepting Stigmaria Jicoides aa representing the

underground organs of almost any carboniferous Lycopod.

   We are now in possession of a magnificent mass of data for the morphology

of the palajozoic lycopods, and have perhaps hardly yet realised the ricbness of

our material. I refer more especially to specimens with structure, on which, here

as elsewhere, the scientific knowledge of fossil plants primarily depends.

     It is scarcely necessary to repeat what has been said so often elsewhere, that

the now almost universal recognition of the cryptogamic nature of Calamodendreaj

and Sigillariie is a splendid triumph for the opinions of the late Professor

Williamson, which he gallantly maintained through a quarter of a century of

controversy.

    Perhaps, however, the keenest interest now centres in the Ferns and fern-like
plants of the carboniferous epoch. No fossil remains of plants are more abundant,

or more familiar to collectors, than the beautiful and varied fern-fronds from the

older strata. The mere form, and even the venation of these fronds, however,
really tell us little, for we know how deceptive such characters may be among

recent plants. In a certain number of cases, discovery of the fructification has

come to our aid, and whei-e sori are found we can have no more doubt as to the

specimens belonging to true Ferns. The work of Stur and Zeiller has been

especially valuable in this direction, and has revealed the interesting fact that a

great many of these early Ferns showed forms of fructification now limited to the

small order Marattiacese. I think perhaps the predominance of this group has

been somewhat exaggerated, but at least there is no doubt that the marattiaceous
type was much more important then than now, though it by no means stood

alone. In certain cases the whole fern-plant can be built up. Thus Zeiller and

Renault have shown that the great stems known as Psaronius, the structure of

which is perfectly preserved, bore fronds of the Pecopteris form, and that similar
Pecojo^ms fronds produced the fructificacion o^ A8terotheca,'^\i\ch.is of a marat-

traceous character. Hence, for a good many Carboniferous and Permian forms
there is not the slightest doubt as to their feru-nature, and we can even form an

idea of the particular group of Ferns to which the affinity is closest.
     I will say nothing more as to the true Ferns, though they present innumerable

points of interest, but will pass on at once to certain forms of even greater import-

ance to the comparative morphologist.

   A considerable number of palaeozoic plants are now known which present

characters intermediate between those of Ferns and Cycadese. I say jiresent inter-

mediate characters, because that is a safe statement ; we cannot go further than
this at present, for we do not yet know the reproductive organs of the forms in

question.

    In Lt/f/inodendron, the vegetative organs of which are now completely known,

the stem has on the whole a cycadean structure ; the anatomy, which is preserved
with astonishing perfection, presents some remarkable peculiarities, the most
striking being that the vascular bundles of the stem have precisely the same
arrangement of their elements as is found in the leaves of existing Cycads, but
nowhere else among living plants. The roots also, though not unlike those of
certain ferns in their primary organisation, grew in thickness by means of

cambium, like those of a Gymnosperm. On the other hand, the leaves of

Li/ginodendron are typical fern-fronds, having the form characteristic of the
genus Sphenopteris, and being probably identical with the species S. Haminghausi.
Their minute structure is also exactly that of a feru-i-ond, so that no botanist
would doubt that he had to do with a Fern if the leaves alone were before him.

     This plant thus presents an unmistakable combination of cycadean and fern-

like characters. Another and more ancient genus, Heterangium., agrees in many

details with Lyginodendron, but stands nearer the ferns, the stem in its priuiary
structure resembling that of a Gleichenia, though it grows in thickness like a
cycad. These intermediate characters led Professor Williamson and myself to
the conclusion that these two genera were derived from an ancient stock of Ferns,
combining the characters of several of the existing families, and that they had

already considerably diverged from this stock in a cycadean direction. I believe

that recent investigations, of which I hope we shall hear more from Mr. Seward,

tend to supply a link between Lyginodendron and the more distinctly cycadean
stem known as Cycadoxylon.

      Heterangium first appears in the Burntisland beds, at the base of the carboni-
ferous system ; from a similar horizon in Silesia, Count Solms-Laubach has de-
scribed another fossil, Protopitys Bucheana, the vegetative structure of which also
shows, though in a different form, a striking union of the characters of Ferns and
Gymnosperms. Count Solms shows that this genus cannot well be included amon<i;

the Lyginodendrese, but must be placed in a family of its own, which, to use his own
 words, ' increases the number of extinct types which show a transition between the

 characters of Filicineje and of Gymnosperms, and which thus might represent the

descendants in different directions of a primitive group common to both.'

      Another intermediate group, quite different from either of the foregoing, is
 that of the Medulloseje, fossils most frequent in the Upper Carboniferous and Per-
 mian strata. The stems have a remarkably complicated structure, built up of a

 number of distinct rings of wood and bast, each growing by its own cambium.
 Whether these rings represent so many separate primary cylinders, like those of an

 ordinary polystelic Fern, or are entirely the product of anomalous secondary

 growth, is still an open question, on which we may expect more light from the

 investigations of Count Solms. In any case, these curious stems (which certainly
 suggest in themselves some relation to Cycadeae) are known to have borne the
 petioles known as Myeloxylon which have precisely the structure of cycadean

  petioles.-

       Renault has further brought forward convincing evidence that these Myeloxy.'"n

 petioles terminated in distinctly fern-like foliage, referable to the form-gene:'a

1008  --REPORT 1896.

Alethopteris and Neuropteris. Hence it is evident that the fronds of these types,
like some specimens of Sphenopteris, cannot be accepted as true Ferns, but may

be strongly suspected of belonging to intermediate groups between Ferns and

Cycads.
     It is not likely (as has been repeatedly pointed out elsewhere) that any of these

intermediate forms are really direct ancestors of our existing Cycads, which
certainly constitute only a small and insignificant remnant of what was once a

great class, derived, as I think the evidence shows, from fern-like ancestors,

probably by several lines of descent.

     One of the greatest discoveries in fossil botany Avas undoubt-edly that of the

--Cordaiteffi a fourth family of Gymnosperms, quite distinct from the three now

existing, though having certain points in common with all of them. They are

much the most ancient of the four stocks, extending back far into the Devonian.

Nearly all the wood of Carboniferous age, formerly referred to Conifers under the

name of Dadoxylon or Araucarioxylon, belonged to these plants. Thanks chiefly

to the brilliant researches of Renault and Grand' Eury, the structure of these' fine

trees is now known with great completeness. The roots and stems have a coniferous

character, but the latter contain a large, chambered pith diiiereut from anything in

that order. The great simple lanceolate or spatulate leaver, sometimes a yard

long, were traversed by a number of parallel vascular bundles, each of which has

the exact structure of a foliar bundle iu existing Cycadese. This type of vascular

bundle is evidently one of the most ancient and persistent of characters. Both

the male and female flowers {Cordaianth?t$) are well preserved in some cases. The

morphology of the former has not yet been cleared up, but the stamen, consisting

2^of an upright filament bearing       long pollen-sacs at the top, is quite unlike

anything in Cycadeae ; a comparison is possible either with Gingho or with the

-- --Gnetaceae.
     In the female flowers small cones the axillary ovules appear to have twn
integuments, a character which resembles Gnetaceae rather than any other Gymno-
sperms. Renault's famous discovery of the prothallus in the pollen-grains of
Cordaites indicates the persistence of a cryptogamic character ; but it cannot bt-
said that the group as a whole bears the impress of primitive simplicity, though it

certainly combines in a remarkable way the characters of the three existing orders

of the Gymnosperms.
     There is one genus, Poroxylon, fully and admirably investigated by Messrs.

Bertrand and Renault, which from its perfectly preserved vegetative structure (and
at present nothing else is known) appears to occupy an intermediate position
between the Lyginodendreic and the Cordaiteie. The anatomy of the stem is

almost exactly that of Lyffinodendron, the resemblance extending to the minutest

details, while the leaves seem to closely approach those of Cordaites. Poro.vylon

is at present known only from the Upper Carboniferous, so we cannot regard it as
in any way representing the ancestors of the far more ancient Cordaiteae. The

genus suggests, however, the possibility that the Cordaiteae and the Cycadeas

(taking the latter term in its wide sense) may have had a common origin among

forms belonging to the filicinean stock. It is also possible that the Cordaiteae, or

plants allied to them, may in their turn have given rise to both Coniferae and

Gnetaceae.

    It is unfortunate that at present we do not know the fructification of any ot

the fossil plants which appear to be intermediate between ferns and Gymnosperms.
Sooner or later the discovery will doubtless be made in some of these forms, and
most interesting it will be. M. Renault's Cycadospadi.v from Autun appears to

show that very cycad-like fructifications already existed in the later Carboniferous
period, and numerous isolated seeds point in the same direction, but we do not

know to what plants they belonged.
    I think we may say that such definite evidence as we already possess decidedly

points in the direction of the origin of the Gymnosperms generally from plants of

the Fern series rather than from a lycopodiaceous stock.
     I must say a few words before concluding on the cycad-like fossils which are

80 strikinE" a "feature of mesozoic rocks, although I feel that this is a subject with
                     TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                1009

my\v. lhicli  friend Mr. Seward is far more competeut to deal.    Both leaves and

trunks of an unmistakably cycadean character are exceedingly common in many

mesozoic strata, from the Lias up to the Lower Cretaceous. In some cases the

structure of the stem is preserved, and then it appears that the anatomy as well

as the external morpholoory is, on the Avhole, cycadean, though simpler, as regards

the course of the vascular bundles, than that of recent representatives of the

group.

     Strange to say, however, it is only in the rarest cases that fructifications of a
truly cycadean type have been found in association with tliese leaves and stems. In

most cases, wlien the fructification is accurately known, it hastm-ned out to be of a
type totally different from that of the true Cycadete, and much more highly organ-

ised. This is the form of fructification characteristic o{ Bennettites, a, most remark-
able group, the organisation of which was first revealed by the researches of

Carruthers, afterwards extended by those of Solms-Laubach and Lignier. The
genus evidently had a great geological range, extending from the Middle Oolite (or
perhaps even older strata) to the Lower Greensand. Probably, all botanists are

agreed in attributing cycadean affinities to the Bennettiteae, "and no doubt they

are justified in this. Yet the cycadean characters are entirely vegetative and anato-

mical ; the fructification is as different as possible from that of any existing cycad,

or, for that matter, of any existing Gymuosperm. At present, only the female
flower is accurately known, though Count Solms has found some indications of

anthers in certain Italian specimens. The fructification of the typical species, £.
Gibsonianus, which is preserved in marvellous perfection in the classical specimens
from the Isle of Wight, terminates a short branch inserted between the leaf-basee,

and consists of a fleshy receptacle bearing a great number of seeds seated on a long

pedicel with barren scales between them. The whole mass of seeds and inter-

mediate scales is closely packed into a head, and is enclosed by a kind of pericarp
formed of coherent scales, and pierced by the micropylar terminations of the erect

seeds. Outside the pericarp, again, is an envelope of bracts which have precisely

the structure of scale-leaves in cycads. The internal structure of the seeds is per-
fectly preserved, and strange to say, they are nearly, if not quite, exalbuminous,
practically the whole cavity being occupied by a large dicotyledonous embryo.

     This extraordinary fructification is entirely diflPerent from that of any other
known group of plants, recent or fossil, and characterises the Bennettitese, as a

family perfectly distinct from the Cycadeae, though probably, as Count Solms-

Laubach suggests, having a common origin with them at some remote period. The

Bennettiteae, while approaching Angiosperms in the complexity of their fruit,

retain a filicinean character in their ramenta, which are quite like those of ferns,

and different from any other form of hair found in recent Cycadeae. Probably the

bennettitean and cycadean series diverged from each other at a point not far re-

moved from the filicinean stock common to both.

I hope that the hasty sketch which I have attempted of some of the indications

of descent afforded by modern work on fossil plants may have served to illustrate

the importance of the questions involved and to bring home to botanists the fact

that phylogenetic problems can no longer be adequately dealt with without taking

into account the historical evidence which the rocks afford us.

Before leaving this subject I desire to express the great regret which all

botanists musi. feel at the recent loss of one of the few men in England who haye

carried on original work in fossil botany. At the last meeting of the Association
we had to lament the death, at a ripe old age, of a great leader in this branch of

science. Professor W. C. Williamson. Only a few weeks ago we heard of the

premature decease of Thomas Hick, for many years his demonstrator and
colleague. Mr Hick profited by his association with his distinguished chief, and
made many valuable original contributions to palseobotany (not to mention other

parts  of botanical  science),  among  which  I  may  especially  recall  his  work,  in
                 _

conjunction with Mr. Cash, on Astrcniiyelon (now known to be the root of

Calamites), on the leaves and on the primary structure of the stem in Calamites, on

the structure of Calamostnchys, on the root of Lyginodendroii, and on a new fossil

probably allied to Stigmaria. His loss will leave a gap in the too thin ranks of

fossil-botanists; but we may hope that the subject, uow that its luiportance is
begiDiiiiig to be appreciated, will be taken up by a new generation of enthusiastic

investigators.

                                                        Conclusion.

    myTo mind there is a wonderful fascination in the records of the far-distant

past in which our own origin, like that of our distant cousins the plants, lies
hidden. If any fact is brought home to us by the investigations of modem

biology, it is the conviction that all life is one : that, as Nageli said, the distance

from man to the lowest bacterium is less than tlie distance from the lowest bac-

terium to non-living matter.
     In all studies which bear on the origin and past history of living things there

is an element of human interest

                                   ' Hence, in a season of calm weatlier,

                                    Though inland far we be.
                                       Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
                                 Which brought us hither,'

The problems of descent, though strictly speaking they may often prove insoluljle,

-will never lose their attraction I'or the scientiticaliy guided imagination.

        2. On some Species of the Chytridiaceous Gemis J] va^hlyctis.
    By P. Magnus, Professor of Botany in the University of Berlin.

     The autlior maintains the genus Urojihlyctif, established by J. Schroeter, in

opposition to the opinion of Alfred Fischer. He describes the development of the
species Urophlycti.s Krieyerintia , occurring in Cannn carvi, established by him

some years ago, and shows that its sp<n-es are formed by the conjugation of two
cells, arising from ditierent filaments, and that the development of the fungus

takes place within a single cell of the host, namely, the central cell of the gall

produced by it, which is of limited growth. The author proves that the fungus
observed by Trabut in Algiers, which causes large swellings on beetroots, also
belongs to this genus Urop/i/i/ctts. It was described ))y Trabat and also by
Saccardo and Mattirolo as one of the Ustilaginese, (JEdomyced Icproides (Trab.).
The author proves that its spores are likewise formed by the conjugation of two
cells, arising from different filaments, exactly as in Urophlyctis. While these
observers state that the fungus developes in individual cells of the tumours caused
by it, the author shows that the cells containing the fungus are connected with
one another by canals of variable length and width, and that hence the cells con-
taining the fungus are only outgrowths and branches of one and the same cell.
The species only differs from Urophlyctis Kriegeriana in the unlimited growth of the
gall, which corresponds to the continued ramification of the cell attacked by the

ningus.

      Finally, the author deals with the development of the gall of TJrophlyctin
pulposa, which differs from that of the species already described.

their germ tubes.

4. On Coralloi'hizca innata H. Br. and its associated Fungi. By
     A. Vaugiian Jennings, F.L.S., F.G.S., Demonstrator of Botany and

     Geology in the Royal College of Science, Dublin.

     The orchid genus Cwrallorhiza has long been of interest to botanists on account
of the peculiar rhizome from which it derives its name, the absence of roots, and
that loss of chlorophyll associated with a saprophytic habit which it shares with
such forms as Epipogon and Monotropa. During recent years considerable modifi-

cation of the views of botanists as to the nutrition of saprophytes, as well as of
other plants, has taken place owing to their frequently observed connection with
fungoid elements ; and from this point of view any additional information as to

the habit of so specialised a type as Corallorkiza may prove of value.
     The writer has had some growing plants of this species under observation

during July and August in the pine-woods near Davos Platz, and the results may

be roughly stated as follows :

     1. The parenchymatous tissue of the rhizome contains numerous hyphae of a
* Mycorhiza.' These may be colourless, yellow, or brown, are distinctly septate,
and show the character of the mycelium of the higher fungi, not of the ' moulds,'
&c. Though most abundant in the middle cortex, the hyphaa are present in all
layers external to this, and their distribution is often correlated with the presence

of a large quantity of starch.

     2. The rhizome of the growing plant is invariably surrounded by a web of
white, yellow, and brown hyphae, which spread out for a long distance into the
surrounding soil. These hyphae present the same characters under the microscope

as those of the mycorhiza in the tissue cells.

     it. Though in hurriedly gathered specimens the rhizome seems to separate readily
from the soil and its mycelium, a careful examination shows that the growing
shoots bear small papillse crowned with tufts of long hairs, which serve for the
collection and transmission of the fungous hyphse. The latter may be traced in
gi-eat numbers from the surrounding mycelium down the hairs and through the
epidermal cells into the ground tissue.

     4. The presence of these specialised hairs seems to indicate that, whatever may

be the case in other plants, the mycorhiza has here a distinct physiological value to
the orchid, and is not a merely tolerated symbiote.

      5. Attempts to discover whether the mycelium forming the mycorhiza can be
referred to any one species of fungus have not as yet proved conclusive, but the

following observations may be noted:

     (a) The general and microscopic characters of the hyphae point to the Basidio-
mycetes as the group to which the fungus belongs.

      ib) Sevei-al young agaricoid sporophores have been found growing from the
mycelium round the rhizome. These refused to develop further in cultivation,
but comparison with the early stages of Clitocybe infundibuliformis Sch., found a
few feet distant, indicates that this is the species to which they belong.

     (c) In another locality Tricholoma ionides Bull, was found grovsdng from the
hole from which a plant of Corallorhiza had been removed three days before.

      (^d) In a third case a subterranean hymenomycete, probably a species of

Hymenogaster, was found between the lobes of the rhizome with its mycelium

spreading over the branches.

      So far, then, as this district is concerned, it seems that the ' mycorhiza ' of
Corallorhiza is a hymenomycete, and commonly an agaric ; and that the species of
Tricholoma and Clitocybe mentioned above are those commonly observed. The

only other forms yet noted in proximity to CoralJorhiza are Cortinarius subfer-

7-ugineus Batsch. and Mycma umbellifera Sch., but further evidence with regard tc

these is at present wanting.

5. On a New Genus of 8chizomycetes, sho^ring Longitudinal Fission.
     (Astrobacter Jonesii.) By A. Vaugiian Jennings, F.L.S., F.6.S.,

     Demonstrator of Geology and Botany in the Royal College of Science,.

      Dublin.

     The great section of lower fungoid organisms kno^vn as the Schizomycetes i."
characterised by the predominance of reproduction by the simple method of fission.

In aUnost all cases the direction of division is transverse to the longer axis of the

cell, and this is, in fact, commonly regarded as constant throughout the group.
     One exception has, however, been described by Metschnikotf in the form named

by him Pasteuna ramosa, a pear-shaped organism in which longitudinal division
produces more or less radiate groups of pyriform cells.

     The object of the present note is to record the existence of a second genus, in
which longitudinal fission results in the formation of a still more distinctly stellate

structure.

     The organism in question was found by Mr, A. Ooppen Jones, F.L.S., in fresh
water in the neighbourhood of Tubingen, associated with large quantities of

fipirillum undula. It was, in fact, only after staining the material to demonstrate
the cilia in the latter that it was tirst observed, unfortunately too late for investi-
gation in the living condition.

     Simple rod-like forms may be found, but more frequently V-shaped or
Y-shaped cells resulting from their longitudinal fission. After division the new
segments become more and more widely separated at the ends till regular three- or

four-rayed stars are produced. In later stages symmetrical six- and eight-rayed
stars are formed, but older individuals with ten or more rays are less regular in
structure. There is no tendency to the pear-shaped swelling seen in Pasteuria,
and no spores have been observed. Owing to the intensity of the staining, little
can be said at present as to their internal structure, and details as to the life-
liistory await further investigation.

     There is no doubt, however, that the organism is allied to the bacteria, and
that its peculiar shape is the result of longitudinal division. It may in future be
desirable to divide the Schizomyct-tes into two sections, those in which the divi-
sion is transverse {Diaschizce), and those in which it is longitudinal (Paraschiza).

    The generic name proposed is at once suggested by its form ; the specific name
is in honour of the discoverer, whose valuable work on the tubercle bacillus is now

being recognised by all bacteriologists.

1. On the Arrangement of the Vascular Bundles in certain Nymphseaceie-
                   By D. T. Gwynne-Vaugiian, B.A. Cantab.

One of the most remarkable characteristics of this order is the very extensive

prevalence of the astelic system in the arrangement of the vascular bundles of

their stems                                           however, during an examination into the structure of various

members of the order, the fact that other systems of arrangement also are present

came to light. Thus in Nymphcea flaca and N. tuberosa the plants produce small

tubers at the ends of stalks or stolons of greater or less length, and in these stalks

or stolons the vascular bundles aj-e not arranged in an astelic manner, but are

grouped around three to five different centres, forming thus so many separate

steles, or at least so many groups possessing all the characteristics of definite

steles. Each of these is surrounded by its own endodermis, and is composed of

three to four vascular bundles with very distinct and prominent phloems, while a

small canal in the centre of the stele represents their disintegrated xylems.

     The tubers formsd at the end of these stolons bear buds which grow out into
 resh rhizomes, the first internodes of which are very narrow and much elongated

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

in these, again, the vascular bundles (four to seven in number) exhibit a different
arrangement, for they present none of the confusion found in the mature rhizome,
but run perfectly longitudinally ; either they aU keep separate, or a varying number

of them may be united to form pairs. When six of them are present and these are

arranged in three pairs, the section presents a remarkable resemblance to that of

the floral peduncle of Cabomba aquatica.

     Again, in the rhizome itself the arrangement is not altogether astelic, for bv
the aggregation of the separated bundles of the stem a number of steles are
formed, one in the region below the point of insertion of each leaf. These groups
of bundles appear to be set apart for the especial purpose of bearing the adventi-
tious roots, and they are to bs found in varying degrees of perfection throughout
the order. I found Victoria regia and certain species of Nymphmct to possess the
most perfect root-bearing steles ; they are composed of ten to twenty bundles

arranged in a ring, and are perfectly distinct and well defined. On the other
hand, in other species of Nymphcea and in Nuphar the bundles set apart for bearing

the adventitious roots are not arranged in a sufficiently regular manner to be con-
sidered as a stele, or are only laterally fused together to form an arc of greater or

less extent.

                   2. The Influence of Habitat upon Plant-Habit.

               By G. F. Scott Elliot, B.Sc, F.L.S., F.R.G.S.

 '% The paper is an attempt to tabulate and compare the habits and habitats of

the Rinunculaceae, Papiveracese, and Cnicifei'se in the Kew and British Museum

Herbaria, or those from the European and Mediterranean floras practicallv.
There were only 230 plants in which such tabulation of both habit and habitat was
possible. The author's tables are given below, and the paper is explanatorv of
them, giving the result of recent literature and experiment so far as it illustrates
or explains the tables. The dependence of habit upon habitat is shown to be very
clear throughout. In conclusion, the author anticipates the objections of those

who hold the original hypothesis of Professor Weismann (that acquired characters

can by no means be inherited) by pointing to the most recent publication of this
writer, wherein use-inheritance of a kind is admitted. In any case the corre-

spondence must be explained by those who deny any relation bstween liabit and

habitat on purely theoretical grounds.

_'. 0)1 the so-called Tubercle Bacillus. By A. Coppen Jones, F.L.S.
           [Communicated by A. Vauuhan Jennings, F.L.S., F.G.S., &c.]

     Since the demonstration by Kobert Kouh in 18S2 of a specific micro-organism

constantly associated with and capable of producing tuberculous disease, the
Bacillus tuberculosis has been the object of a great amount of investigation, w^hich

has resulted in a vast accumulation of literature. The minute rod-like organism
which bears the name is better known to pathologists than any other pathogenic

fungus, and may be easily diagnosed by the characteristic and unique appearance

of its pure cultures on solid media, by the difficulty of staining it with the ordi-
nary aniline dyes, and by the resistance it offers when stained to the decolorising

action even of mineral acids.

    Its claim to be regarded as a true bacillus has only very recently been ques-

tioned, but there are several considerations which tend to modify our views with

respect to  its  biological  status                                          and  the following   observations, made                                    during the
                                                                 ;

last few years, and continued up to the present time, are, from this point of view,

not without interest :

    1. While the well-known simple rod-like form is by far the commonest, and,

n fact, the only form to be foimd in the vast majority oi' cases, whether in the

tissues, in sputum, or in cavity contents, there may be "observed, not infrequently,

elongated examples which develop lateral outgrowths, twigs, or incipient branching.

    2. In rarer cases this process results in the formation of definite threads or

hyphse, which exhibit true branching, and often contain one or more spores,

forming oval, highly refracting, deeply stained swellings on the course of the

filaments. It is to be particularly noted, first, that these spores have far more

resemblance to the chlamydospores of the true filamentous fungi than to the

typical endospores  of bacteria                                              and, secondly, that  tliey must  on  no                                    account  be
                                                                          ;

confounded with the unstained intervals on the course of the rods or filaments of

the tubercle organism. These were formerly described by Koch as spores, but are

really vacuoles in the cell contents, or, in some cases, spaces caused by the plasmo-

lytic shrinkage of the protoplasm. Occasionally, in cavity contents, densely

matted mycelial growths have been observed.

    3. When old cultures are examined by means of sections it is found that the

growth does not consist of separated rod-hke forms, isolated from one another and

lying at all angles, but of strands of parallel filaments, frequently showing

dichotomous branching

     4. These facts indicate that the so-called 'tubercle bacillus' is' really a stage
in the life-history of some higher form of fungus with a definite mycelial growth.

Frorn a systematic point of view, it cannot be regarded as coming within any
definition of the genus Bacillus, and it is suggested that a more appropriate name
would be Tuberculomyces.

    Pathologists, who for the most part believe strongly in the constancy of form

of the species of bacteria, may not be inclined at first to accept these conclusions.

Bearing in mind the controversies of the past on the specific distinctness of micro-

organisms and the many erroneous observations which have led to false statements

as  to  polymorphism,   such  scepticism                                          is  both  natural  and  desirable                                     but in   the
                                                                                                                                                     ;

present case the tracing of all stages between the short rods and the branched

hyphal filaments, their identical behaviour towards reagents, and the occurrence of

all these forms in pure cultures, place their genetic relationship beyond a doubt.

    Brefeld has proved that a number of the higher thallus-forming fuugi may,

under certain conditions, multiply for innumerable generations as mere unicellular

rods or spheres (' oidia,' &c.), and yet retain the power of again forming, when

placed under suitable conditions, the mycelium from which they arose. It is
1016  REPORT-- 1896.

therefore no far-fetched supposition to regard the rod-like form of the tubercle
parasite as an adaptive modification of some higher fungus, existing perhaps as a

eaprophyte outside the animal body. Further support for such a view may be seen
in the fact that the tubercle fungus occupies a unique position among the patho-

genic micro-organisms resembling only the well-known hyphomycete Actinomyces.
The resemban^-} of these two forms was pointed out in 1892 by Fischel, and the
present writer has been able to show that the tubercle organism is accompanied in
a large proportion of cases by club-shaped growths identical with those so

characteristic of Actinomycosis. Now it has been placed beyond a doubt that

Actinomyces is primarily a parasite saprophytic on cereal plants, and that its
occurrence as an animal parasite can only be regarded as secondary and accidental.

     Whether the change in our view as to the real nature of the tubercle fungus
will in the future be of any diagnostic value it is impossible to say, as compara-
tively few cases showing the filamentous growth have yet been observed ; but
there is some evidence in support of the idea that the hyphal type may be
correlated with more chronic stages of the disease, where actual tissue destruction

is relatively slight.

    gonum. By J. W. H.' Trail, F.R.S., Professor of Botany in the
      University of Aberdeen.

     The genus has long been* known to show considerable departures from the

arrangement and number of parts accepted as most typical (Per. 5. St. 5 + 3, C. .5),
such as is found in F. convolvulus. Eichler's ' Bliithendiagramme,' for example,
shows diagrams of several species as if characterised by constant differences of
structures. Observation shows that in some species (e.g. Convolvulus) variations
are comparatively infrequent and slight, but tiiat in most {e.y. Pprsicaria and
nviculare) they are extremely frequent, and lead to very great changes in floral
structure. Often it is scarcely possible in such species to find two flowers alike on
the same l)ranch, or even on the same plant. Within a species individual plants
show wide differences in the frequency and extent of variations.

   A comparison of different species shows that while each varies, so as in the

more variable species to cover almost tl>e whole range observed in the genus,
each shows a tendency to certain lines of variation. These tendencies are more
alike usually in the more nearly allied species, so as to correspond in the main with
the groups based on habit, and they lead from group to group.

     The modes of variation commonly observed include almost all the recognised
modes of departure from floral, symmetry. They affect all the whorls. The
perianth in some species is very constant. In otliers it habitually shows cohesion
of two or more segments, or abortion in different degrees, or suppression of one or
two (usually the inner) segments. Chorisis of a .segment is less frequent.
Enations from one or more segments are frequent in certain species, rare or
absent in others. The outer stamens often show cohesion of the two in each pair,
varying from the slightest union of the bases of the filaments to absolute union of
even the anthers. Abortion (in all degrees to complete suppression) of one or
more stamens is not rare, frequently reducing this whorl to 3 (less often to 2) in
auiculare. Chorisis is not rare, especially of the unpaired stamen. The inner
stamens seldom show cohesion (except in aviculare and its allies) with stamens of

the outer whorl. Abortion (in ail degrees to complete suppression) is very fre-
quent, and in certain species (ampliibium) this whorl has completely disappeared.
In aviculare and allied species the inner whorl shows abortion less than the outer.
Chorisis in the inner whorl most frequently shows itself in the posterior stamen.
Adhesions of stamens to perianth segments and petalody of stamens are not

frequent.

      (In P. amphibium the land form near Aberdeen very generally has the anthers
very small or abortive, and the stamens hidden within the perianth, while the form
growing in water has the anthers well developed, and some or all eiserted ; neither
form appears to seed habitually.)
                                                                       --;

        The pistil in some species is very constant, while in others it shows all stages
   of cohesion and reduction to two carpels, this beiug the almost invariable number
   in certain species. Abortion is less frequent, and complete suppression cannot be
   distinguished from complete cohesion. Chorisis is very frequent in aviculare and
   some other species, in all degrees from a mere enlargement of one or more stigmas
   to an increase in number (up to seven), with corresponding modifications in
   structure in the ovary. Only one ovule has been observed in each ovary.

        Markedly teratological forms have been met with, but are not included in this
   eummary.

       No very definite relation has been traced between the position of a flower on

   iJie axis and deviations in structure, though pressure tends to abortion or suppres-
   sion of parts, especially of the sexual organs. (The flowers examined have chiefly
   been those sufficiently open to allow the natural arrangement to be noted without

   manipulation, to avoid displacement of parts, hence cleistogamous flowers are

   scarcely included.) The variability appears rather to express the result of an
   innate tendency to vary where not subject to the check of loss of fertility, the
   variations in Polygonum not leading to this loss.

       The same number of parts in a whorl may be due to very different causes, and
   still more may the same number of stamens express very different arrangements in

   the flower ; hence such a statement in a specific description as ' stamens usually

   popularly called Crab's Eyes, are harmless when eaten, but rapidly produce fatal
   eflects when introduced beneath the skin in very small quantity. Even the seeds
   of the common Laburnum {Laburnum vulgare) are responsible for more than one

   death amongst children in this country every summer ; and recently ten cattle

   were poisoned in Mid-Lothian by eating the leaves of this plant. The most

   remarkable effects are produced on horses in the Western States of America by feed-
   ing on species of Astragalus and Oxytropis, locally known as Crazy or Loco plants.

   The animals pass through a stage of temporary intoxication and act as if attacked

   with blind staggers, and ultimately die. Lastly, there is paralysis of the hinder

   extremities produced in horses (also in human beings) by feeding on the seeds of

   the Bitter Vetch (Lathyrus sativus). This has occurred very widely in India.

   The condition so induced is known as 'lathyrismus.'

       The subject of this note is a plant that has received little or no attention. As
   far as I am aware, its singular properties have not been placed on record in this

   country. The Wild Tamarind of Jamaica and the Jumbai or Jumbie of the
   Bahamas (Leuccena glatcca, Benth.) is commonly found along roadsides and in

   waste places in Tropical America. It presents the appearance of a weedy-looking

   Acacia, and belongs to the tribe Eumimosecs of the N. O. Leguminosce. The plant
   is now so widely distributed in tropical countries that its native habitat, according

   to Bentham, is unknown. There is, however, no doubt of its American origin.
   The extensive distribution of so unattractive a plant is probably due : (1) to the

   fecility with which the small flat seeds are carried about by man or animals

   (2) to the use to which the seeds are put in making ornamental articles such as

   Aartificial flowers, bracelets, brooches, baskets, &c.  set of these is shown in the

   Kew Museums, The following is a brief description of the species :

S. Europe and North Africa ; widely found in tropical Africa, East Indies, Ceylon,

Mauritius, Java, and China. Probably introduced into Africa and Asia.

Thirteen years ago I drew attention to the properties of this plant in a few

--words that appeared in the ' Eeport of the Botanical Department, Jamaica,' 1883,

p. 19, as follows : IFild Tamarind. ' Mr. Kobert Eussell, of St. Ann's, informs

me that horses feeding on the leaves of this plant completely lose the hair from
their manes and tails. He adds, " Horses from Llandovery, Richmond, and that

side of the parish where the Wild Tamarind abounds, are frequently to be seen

tail-less and mane-less." ' This statement was supported by the testimony of so

many people acquainted with the facts that there was no reason to doubt it.
Many years afterwards (in December 1895) I renewed my acquaintance with the

plant in the Bahamas. The plant was much more plentiful there than in

Jamaica; it was, in fact, distinctly encouraged in the former islands as a fodder

plant. The people were fully aware of the singular effect it produced on horses,

and added that it also afl'ected mules and donkeys. Its effect on pigs was still

more marked. These animals assumed a completely naked condition, and appeared

without a single hair on their body. Horses badly affected by Jumbai were
occasionally seen in the streets of Nassau, where they were known as ' cigar-tails.'

Such depilated animals, although apparently healthy, were considerably depreciated

in value. They were said to recover wlien fed exclusively on corn and grass.

The new hair was, however, of a different colour and texture, ' so the animals were

never quite the same.' One animal was cited as having lost its hoofs as well, and

in consequence it had to be kept in slings until they grew again and hardened. The

effects of the Jumbai on horses,mules,doukeys,andpigswere regarded as accidental
due to neglect or ignorance. The plant was really encouraged to supply food for

cattle, sheep, and goats. The latter greedily devoured it and were not perceptibly

affected by it. It will be noticed that the animals affected were non-ruminants, while

those not affected were ruminants. The probable explanation is that the ruminants,

by thoroughly mixing the food with saliva and slowly digesting it, were enabled

to neutralise the action of the poison and escape injury. The seeds probably

contain the deleterious principle in a greater degree than any other part of the

plant. It was a common experience that animals introduced from other localities

suffered more than the native animals. The latter were either immune or had

learnt to avoid the plant as noxious to them. The active principle in Leuctena

f/lauca has not yet been investigated. There is abundant material at hand for this

purpose in almost every part of the world. It is probable that the active principle

may consist of a volatile alkaloid somewhat similar to that found in Lathyrus
Asativus.
           certain amount of parallelism is to be noticed in the effects produced

by these two plants. In ' lathyrismus ' (ignoring the effect on man) the chief

sufferer is undoubtedly the horse. The effect on mules and donkeys is not given,

but is probably the same. Although pigs fatten on Lathyrus, they lose the use of

their hinder extremities, as in the horse. Hence the non-ruminating animals as a

class suffer from Lathyrus as they do from Leuccena. The similarity in ruminants

is also very close. For instance, cattle are reported to grow lean if fed exclusively

on Lathyrus, but are not otherwise affected. Sheep are not affected at all.

I am not disposed to attach much importance to the parallelism here noticed.

It is possible that ruminants generally are less susceptible to the action of certain

poisons than non-ruminants. It is evident, however, that in Leucccna r/lauca we

possess a plant with singular properties. It is a vegetable depilatory of a very

decided character. No other plant appears to produce exactly identical results.

3. On some Peculiar Cases of Apogamous Reproduction in Ferns. By

     William H. Lang, M.B., B.Sc, Robert Donaldson Scholar, Glasgow

      University.

In order to ascertain to what extent apogamy in Nephrodiumfilix-mas, Desv.,

is correlated with the cresting of the fern plant, from which the spores were de-

rived, cultures of normal and crested forms were made. Of the three cultures of
normal forms one was unsuccessful ; one of the others was exclusively apogamous,

while the other has, as yet, reproduced in the ordinary way. Seven crested varie-

ties were sown                                                            five of  these were apogamous  and  the other  two normal.  Three
                                                                       ;

of the crested varieties were known with certainty to be wild finds ; two of these

were apogamous. From these results it appears that apogamy in N.fli.v-mas

stands in no definite relation to cresting. "When the ferns sown were divided into

WoUaston's species, N. flix mas, N. pseudo-mas, and N. jn-opinquum, it was found

that all the varieties of the two former were apogamous, while both normal and

crested forms of JV. jjropinquwn were normally reproduced. The basis of observa-

tion is, however, too limited to allow of any general conclusion being drawn as to

the constancy of this difference.

     Cultures were also made of crested varieties of other species. In all in which
young plants were produced their development was at first normal. After the

cultures had continued for nine mouths young plants, developed apogamously,

were found in Scolopendrium vulgare, Athyrimn filix fmnina and Aspidium aculea-
tum, var. angulare. It is impossible at present to decide how iar the result can be

ascribed to cresting of the parent plant. Possibly the prolonged cultivation of

unfertilised prothalli is tlie more important factor in these cases, the cresting aiding

as a predisposing cause.

Unfertilised prothalli of Scolopendrium vulgare formed a cylindrical, fleshy

prolongation of the midrib, the tip of which became in time covered with ramenta,
and was continued directly as the axis of the young sporophyte. Archegonia were

present just below the ramenta.

In some prothalli of a fern from Mr. Druery's collection, which was labelled

Lastraa dilatata, var. cristato-gracilis, a similar prolongation of the median region

was found. Upon this sporangia wei-e borne, sometimes singly, in other cases

grouped together so as to resemble a sorus. The sporangia liad a well-developed
annulus which sometimes showed the characteristic reddish-brown thickenings of
the wall. The prolongation on which the sporangia were situated bore archegonia
and antheridia which sometimes intervened between two groups of sporangia. Its

prothallial nature was, therefore, beyond doubt. The sporangia were borne on

prothalli on which no trace of a young sporophyte could be detected.

Paper :

                Some Current Problems connected loith Cell- Division.

                          By Professor J. Bretland Farmer.

    The great mass of information concerning the phenomena of cell-structure
forms the excuse for attempting to test some of the leading hypotheses and theories
as to the meaning of the observed facts.

    And firstly, it is necessary to exercise great care in laying the foundations of
our knowledge, since these depend so much on material which has been subjected

to an elaborate technical treatment before it can be appropriately examined.
      Secondly, there is a widespread tendency to generalise from a study, exhaustive-

it may be, of a few types. But there is so much variety, that, save in the broadest

outlines, it is hardly possible to speak of a type at all.

    This is illustrated by the present position of the centrosome question. Few

people are agreed as to what its very nature actually is, and perhaps still fewer a&
to the part which it plays in the cell. Some regard it as the active agent in

bringing about nuclear division, whilst others believe it to be a transient structure,

called into existence by the forces which are at work during karyokinesis. The
occurrence and behaviour of centrosomes during karyokinesis Cnutosis) require a
comparative treatment. Whilst it is quite possible that in the cells of some
organisms the centrosome may possess a marked individuality, it does not there-
fore necessarily follow that it must occur universally, or that it is concerned, as a
principal, with the process ; and this latter remark applies even to those instances
in which it appears most prominently. Post hoc does not always imply

propter hoc.

     Tbe present position of the question as to the origin and nature of the achro^
matic spindle, also, is a very uncertain one. Does the spindle arise as the result of
an onward development of a pre-existing rudiment, or is it a new formation in the-
protoplasm? In the answer to this question, no less than in the conclusion to
which we arrive as to the nature of the centrosome, an important principle is
involved. It is, doubtless, simpler to admit a variety of 'organs' in the cell, but
 does such an admission bring us any nearer to understanding the actual processes

 of cell life ?

     Again, the chromosomes themselves present abundant difficidties, when one

 tries to arrive at a rational account which shall embrace the facts which even yet
 have been ascertained respecting them. If individuality be conceded to the chro-

mosomes, how can this be reconciled with the facts of reduction and fertilisation ?

 It would seem that the reduction can be effected in various and radically different
ways. But this touches very nearly their claims to the possession of that compli-
 cated structure which has been regarded as probable by some writers, and which is
supposed by them to be intimately associated with different hereditary properties.

-2. On Hie Ueterotype Divisions of Lilium Martagon. By Ethel Sargant.

     There are two series of nuclear divisions in tlie life-history oi Lilium Martagon
which exhibit twelve chromosomes iu place of twenty-four.

     I. Spermatogenesis:

      1. First division of pollen mother-cell nucleus.
     2. Second division of pollen mother-cell nucleus.
     3. Di\dsion of pollen-grain nucleus into vegetative and generative nuclei.
     4. Division of generative nucleus in pollen-tube.

II. Oogenesis :

      1. Division of primary embryo-sac nucleus into micropylar      and                                                                                                                     chalazaJ

nuclei.

      2. Division of micropylar daughter nucleus.
     3. Division of both daughter nuclei of the micropylar nucleus.

    My preparations include the whole oogenetic series and the first three divisions

of the spermatogenetic series. The second and third divisions in both are precisely

similar to vegetative nuclear divisions except in possessing only half the number o'f
chromosomes. They are called homotijpe.

     The first nuclear division on either side is called heterotype, because the process
of karyokinesis differs from that of the vegetative nucleus. The chief points which

distinguish it are :

     1. The resting nucleus, after some increase in size, passes into a contracted state

called synapsis.

     2. The chromatic ribbon of the spirem is not homogeneous, but is composed of
an ery throphilous ribbon bearing a double row of cyanophilous dots.

      3. Longitudinal fission appears iu the spu-em ribbon before its division intO'
chromosomes.

    A4. second longitudinal fission appears in each segment of the immature

chromosomes.

     5. The segments of each chromosome are tightly twisted on each other, and
separate from near the middle or from either end. The untwisting of the segments
from each other as they separate gives a contorted appearance to each chromosome
of the nuclear plate, and adjacent chromosomes are often of totally different shape.
The appearance of the heterotype spindle is therefore much less regular than that
of the homotype spindle.

     6. The chromosomes of the diaster stage are usually V-shaped.

C3. On the Cells of the ijanophycece. By Professor E. Zacharias.

myMy recent researches on tlie Cyanophycere have confirmed and extended

former statements. Cell protoplasm, containing the coloured matter, surrounds a

central body which is colourless. This body is not homogeneous in the living state                                                                                                           ;

when  treated  with  reagents,  it  shows  apparently a spongy structure                                                                                                                     in its sur-
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

face, in certain cases outside of it, are distributed granules of different shape and

size, becoming deeply stained, when treated with methylen-blue. These granules

(' Centralsubstanz,' as I have named them formally) agree, as stated some years

ago, in their reactions with the chromatin of the nucleus of other organisms.
However, I recently found slight difi'erences, which, combined with certain con-

siderations, render it doubtful whether the ' Centralsubstanz ' contains nuclein like
the Chromosomes or not.

     Iodine reactions observed in Gloiotriclda pisum render it probable that the
central body of the spore and of those cells immediately above it contains glycogen.

     The cell protoplasm contains in different stages of cell-life different quantities of
granules, which are chemically different from the central substance. Both kinds of

granules are stored in the spores of Qloiotrichia.

    By certain methods of culture the granulations can be made to vanish entirely

out of the cella.
1022                      HEPORT-- 1896.

The whole of my experiments lead me to suppose that the granules in the cell-

protoplasm are increased in size and number when the cells are able to assimilate

carbon, although under conditions that do not allow them to grow.

The cell-division takes place, as I have stated previously, without showing

karyokinetic processes. Sometimes the disposition of the constituents of the central

body may remind one of karyokinetic stages ; nevertheless this disposition is entirely

variable and without rule.

     Reviewing the facts which we know at the present time, we are obliged to

admit that the central body of the Cyanophyceae differs in important points from

the nucleus of other organisms. It is highly remarkable that often nucleiu has not

been found in the dividing cells of Cyanophyceae, while in other organisms, as far as

we know, the nuclein augments when the cells begin to divide.

In connection with the previous statements, I wish to add some words on

Amicro-chemical methods.  mixture of methylen-blue and fuchsin S. may be used

with great advantage to study the distribution of nuclein in the cell. If one treats

tissues of different origin with diluted hydrochloric acid and afterwards adds the

said mixture, the constituents of the cell which contain nuclein are stained deeply

blue, the parts without that substance being red. Sperm cells of the Rhine-

salmon were treated by me with diluted hydrochloric acid to remove protamin.

Afterwards I stained them with the methylen-blue fuchsin S. mixture. Instantly

the envelopes of the heads which contain the nucleic acid were beautifully dyed

bright blue, the inner part of the heads seemed to be colourless, the tails were dyed

red. Similarly treated, the chromatin bodies of all the nuclei, which as yet have

been examined, are stained blue, the rest of the nuclei and the cell protoplasms red.

That the chromatin bodies contain nuclein had also been proved by their other

reactions. However, it is easily understood, but often not sufficiently attended to,

that it is necessary to treat the tissues quite similarly if one wishes to obtain com-

parable results. Lilienfeld states that white of an e^g coagulated by alcohol can-

not be stained, and removes the colour from the dye-mixture. I, on the contrary,

have stated that white of an egg coagulated by alcohol is stained red by the above-

mentioned mixture. I recently made out that this difference of results must have

been caused by the different y^ajs in which Lilienfeld and I have obtained the

coagulated white of an egg. If one squeezes some white of an egg through a

cloth, and then adds just enough alcohol to coagulate it, the substance thus obtained

cannot be stained red, but removes the colour from the dye-mixture. But if

the coagulate is washed with water, it can now be stained reddish blue, and after

washing it with alcohol, pure red. The water used for washing has an alkaline

reaction, and removes the colour from the dye-mixture.

   --I. Emergences on the-Embryo of Loranthus neelgherensis. The hypoeotyl of

the fully developed embryo is densely covered with green columnar emergences,
whose cortical cells contain chlorophyll, starch, tannin, and a substance giving

the reactions of a fat. Irregular masses of a similarly reacting material are fre-

quently found covering the cuticle.

   A single stoma occurs on the free surface of each emergence, and in the

embryo of this species stomata are confined to the emergences.
     The cuticle covering the general epidermis is continuous over the guard-cells of

each stoma, except for a small oval slit which allows of communication between
the intercellular space and the air. The stomata thus suggest either a serophytic
habit for the plant or an abnormal function for themselves.

     The emergences flourish during the germinating (epiphytic) stage, and later,
when semi-parasitism is achieved, cease to be functional.

--//. Mode ofpenetration into the host of L.neelgherensis. Unlike many species,

L, neelgherensis develops no well-marked organ of attachment (suctorial disc) at

the free end of its hypocotyl.

Where much resistance to the entry of the sucker is offered by the host, there

are formed at the edges of the attached surface of the hypocotyl a series of

acropetally arising, hair-bearing cortical ridges. The later-formed ridges, wedging

themselves in between the older ones and the bark, force these older ridges away.

The firmly attached hairs of each ridge so forced away tear off masses of the

bark, and thus the softer tissues, through which the sucker readily and cleanly

bores, are exposed by instalments. Where the sucker comes in contact with

lignified structures, dissolution is more gradual, and stages of disintegration

(erosion figures) are to be observed.

In L. loniceroides, where a well-marked suctorial disc is formed, attachment

occurs once for all. This attachment is maintained (1) by the growth of the

edge  of the  disc  hard  against  the bark                                    (2)  by the outgrowing hairs  forming  a

      L On Latent Life in Seeds. By M. Casimir de Candolle.

In this paper M. de Candolle gave an account of some experiments which he

has recently carried out on the power of germination of seeds exposed for different

periods to low temperatures. He also recorded striking instances of the develop-

ment of normal seedlings from seeds which have been kept for a great number of

years. From seeds of Nelumhium fpeciosuin, more than a hundred years old,

Robert Brown obtained perfect seedlings. Similar results were recorded from

experiments made on very old seeds in the Tournefort Herbarium, Paris. Plants

buried under rubbish-heaps collected by the Greeks have been found to grow and

develop flowers from seeds which must have been at least 1,500 years old. To test

the condition of a dormant seed, M. de Candolle exposed the seeds of several

plants to a temperature too low to admit of the continuance of the process of

respiration. Seeds of corn, oats, Faeniculum officinale, Mimosa pudica, Gloxinia,

and other plants were exposed for 118 days to a temperature of 40°F. below zei'o.

The means of carrying out these experiments was afforded by refrigerating machines

placed at the disposal of M. de Candolle by a Liverpool firm of meat importers.

The machines worked about eight hours a day, and during that time the tempe-

rature often fell considerably below 40°F. below zero. Nearly all the seeds of

corn, oat, and Fccnicidum germinated, and a great many in the case oi Mimosa.

The Gloxinias did not develop, but there is reason to suppose that they were not

good seeds, as others from the same lot did not germinate freely even under normal

conditions. The conclusion to be drawn from the experiments seems to be this

In resting seeds the protoplasm is not actually living, but has reached a stage of

inaction in which, although not dead, it is endowed with potential life. In other

words, protoplasm in resting seeds is not analogous to a smouldering fire, but

Acertain conditions of temperature and illumination are realised.                   good example

of this condition is afforded by a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen, which can be

preserved indefinitely without combining if kept in the dark, but under the

influence of certain rays of light combine with explosive violence.

      2. On some Carboniferous Fossils referred to Lepidostrobus.
                   By D. li. Scott, M.A., Ph.D., F.R.S.

1. The specimens described by the late Professor W. 0. AVilliamson under the

name of Lepidodendron Spenceri^ consist entirely of pedunculate strobili, and

therefore, if their Lepidodendroid affinities were established, would be placed in the

genus Lepidostrobus. Under the name L. Sj)enceri two distinct species are in-

cluded, differing in the dimensions of the axis, the arrangement of the sporophylls,

and the size, arrangement, and forms of the spores.

The smaller kind, which is the more frequent, is alone figured in Williamson's

memoirs, and must retain the specific name of Spenceri. The structure is pre-

served with great perfection. The anatomy of the peduncle and axis is consistent

with the attribution of the species to Lepidostrobus ; but in several points, notably

the form of the sporophylls and the insertion of the sporangia, the cone differs

from all known Lepidostrobi. It agrees most nearly with a form described by

]M. Zeiller as Sigillariostrobus Crepini? If the latter be a true Sigillario-

strohus then L. Spenceri should also be placed in that genus. In that case it

would be the first fructification of Sigillaria discovered with structure preserved.

The second and larger species appears to be co-generic with the former.

A2. fragment of stem from the Burntisland beds at the base of the Car-

boniferous formation was described by Williamson in 1872 ^ as possibly forming

Apart of the axis of the Lepidostrobus found in the same deposits.      renewed

examination of the specimen has shown that it differs in many respects from any

Lepidodendroid axis, as shown by the pitted, as distinguished from scalariform

tracheides, by the di- or trichotomous leaf-traces, and by the presence of a ventral
lobe on the leaf. The specimen represents a new type of stem, having some points

in common with Sphenophyllwn, but so far of uncertain affinity.

      3. A New Cycad from the Isle of Portland.
             By A. C. Seward, M.A., F.G.S.

    Dr. Woodward lately obtained an exceedingly fine specimen of a cycadean
stem from the Purbeck beds of Portland, which is now in the fossil plant gallery of

the British Museum. The stem, which is probably the largest known, has a height of

A1 m. 18'5 cm., and measures 1 m. 7 cm. in girth at the broadest part.  striking

feature of the specimen is the conical apical bud enclosed by tapered bud scales,

bearing numerous ramental outgrowths on the exposed surface. The surface of

the stem presents the appearance of a prominent reticulum of projecting ridges, of

which the meshes were originally occupied by the persistent petiole bases. The

substance of the leafstalks has for the most part disappeared, while the interpetiolar

ramental tissue has been mineralised and so preserved as a projecting framework.

In structui'e the ramenta are practically identical with those of Bentiettites, as

described by Carruthers and other writers. The petiole bases also agree very closely

with those of Bennettites, consisting of a mass of parenchymatous tissue traversed

by numerous vascular bundles and secretory canals, with a distinct band of cork at

the periphery. No trace of any inflorescence has been found. It is proposed to

name the plant Cycadeoidea gigantea.

                  4. Note on a Large Specimen of Lyginodendron.

                          By A. C. Seward, M.A., F.G.S.

     The specimens on which this description is based are in the Botanical Depart-
ment of the British Museum and in the recently acquired Williamson Collection.

The Mock, from whicli several sections liave been prepared, is a strikinir example

of the preservation of the minute structure of a Coal Measure plant on a large

scale                           it consists of a mass of wood at least 6 cm. thick in a radial direction, and a
                             ;

pith about 3 cm. in diameter, but without any trace of cortical tissue. Sections

obtained from this block, and included in the Williamson Collection, were described

at some length in the recently published memoir by Williamson and Scott on

Lyginodendron and Heteraiujium. The examination of additional specimens has

led to a somewhat fuller diagnosis of the structure and a more detailed comparison

with Lijyinodendron Oldhcmiiiim and other plants. The main mass of the wood

possesses a structure practically identical with that of Lyginodendron Oldhamium

and recent cycadean stems ; internal to the centrifugally developed secondary wood

there is a fairly complete and narrow ring of centripetally developed xylem, In

the pith there are numerous secretory canals and nests of dark-coloured sclerous

cells. No definite traces of primary xylem like that of Lyginodendron Oldhamium

have been detected. As a matter of convenience the specimen may be designated

Lyginodendron robustum.
