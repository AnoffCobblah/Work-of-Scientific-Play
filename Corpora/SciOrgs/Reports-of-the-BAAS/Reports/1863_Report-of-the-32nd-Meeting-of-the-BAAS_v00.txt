REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  XXXI

    Report of the Council of the British Association, presented to the
               General Committee, Wednesday, October 1, 1862.

   1. The Council were directed by the General Committee at Manchester to

maintain the Establishment of the_ Kew Observatory, and a grant of ,£500

was placed at their disposal for the purpose. They have received at each of
their Meetings regular accounts of the proceedings of the Committee of the
Observatory, and they now lay before the General Committee a General

Report of these proceedings during the year 1861-62. (See Report of Kew

Committee for 1861-62.)

  A2. sum of £40 was placed at the disposal of the Kew Committee for the

employment of the Photoheliometer ; and a further sum of £150 for the pur-

pose of obtaining a series of photographic pictures of the Solar surface, with

the cooperation of the Royal Society. The Report of the Kew Committee

will make known the results of these recommendations.
   3. The Report of the Parliamentary Committee has been received by the

Council for presentation to the General Committee today, and is printed for
the information of the Members. (See Report of Parliamentary Committee.)

    4. The Council have to regret the absence from this Meeting of the General
Secretary, Mr. Hopkins, through indisposition, which they sincerely hope will

soon be removed.

    5. The ' Classified Index ' to the Transactions of the Association, which
was authorized to be prepared under the direction of Professor Phillips, is
completed in one of the main divisions ; the remainder will be printed with-
out delay, and will be delivered to the Members who have subscribed for it
before the end of the present year.

    6. At that date it is the request of Professor Phillips to be allowed to
withdraw from the office of Assistant General Secretary to which he has been
appointed, by Annual Election in the General Committee, for nearly thirty-
two years. Having for two years received the useful aid of Mr. G. Griffith,

M.A., of Jesus College, Oxford, he has expressed to the Council his conviction
of the fitness of that gentleman to undertake the duties which have been so
long entrusted to himself.

    7. The Council having considered the subject, and having ascertained from
Professor Phillips that he would be happy to cooperate 'with Mr. Hopkins as
Junior General Secretaiy in the next year, recommend that the arrangement
here suggested be carried out by the General Committee.

   8. The Council received in April, 1862, a communication from Mr. John
Taylor, Jim., and Mr. Richard Taylor, requesting that, on account of his
great age, their father, Mr. Taylor, might be relieved of all further duties as
General Treasurer and Co-Trustee of the Association.

   The warmest thanks of the Council were given to Mr. Taylor for his kind
attention and most valuable services rendered to the Association in two im-
portant offices, as one of the Trustees and sole Genei'al Ti'easurer, and their
regret that any cause should render it necessary for him to desire to be re-
lieved from the duties which he has so efficiently performed for the great
advantage of the Association, almost from its foundation.

   9. Sir Philip de Grey Egerton, Bart., was then requested to accept the

office of Trustee of the British Association ; and Mr. W. Spottiswoode to

undertake the duty of General Treasurer to the Association.
   These Gentlemen have kindly consented to act, and have entered on their

duties.

   10. The Council have been informed that Invitations will be presented to

     Report of the Kexo Committee of the British Association for the
                      Advancement of Science for 1861-1862.

   The Committee of the Kew Observatory submit to the Association the

following Report of their proceedings during the past year.
   Deeinin°- it desirable that the instrumental arrangements and scientific

processes at use in the Observatory should be represented at the International

Exhibition, application was made to the Commissioners for space.
   This was granted in the nave of the building, where the following instru-

ments are at present exhibited :

   A1. set of Self-recording Magnetographs.

   2. An instrument for tabulating from the traces furnished by the Mag-

netographs.

  A3. Unifilar.
   A4. Dip Circle.
  A5. Self-recording Anemometer.

    G. Barometers.

   7. An instrument for testing Thermometers, also a Kew Standard Ther-

mometer.

   8. Sun Pictures, taken by the Kew Heliograph.

   The Committee have the pleasure to inform the Association that a Medal

has been awarded to the Kew Observatory for excellence and accuracy of

construction of instruments for observing terrestrial magnetism ; and that
two Medals have likewise been awarded to Mr. R. Beckley, Mechanical
Assistant at Kew, for his Registering Anemometer, and for his Photographs

of the Sun.

   It is proposed that application be made to the Government Grant Com-

mittee of the Royal Society for the expenses incurred through this exhibition.

   At the time when the last Report was made to the Association, the Staff"

at Kew were occupied with the verification of a set of magnetic instruments

belonging to Prof. De Souza, of the University of Coimbra, a gentleman who
was present at the Meeting at Manchester. The examination of these was

shortly after completed, and the instruments, consisting of a set of Self-
recording Magnetographs, a tabulating instrument, a Dip Circle, and a Unifilar,

have since been safely received at Coimbra.

   The following letter was addressed to the Chairman by Prof. De Souza

shortly before his departure :
                                                                                         " London, 26th October, 1861.

  --" Mr dear Sir, I cannot leave England, where I have been exceedingly

favoured by the Committee of the Kew Observatory of the British Associa-
tion, without expressing to you my hearty thanks for the help I have expe-

rienced from the Committee in the construction and verification of the
Magnetic and Meteorologic instruments for the University of Coimbra, as
well as for the valuable instruction which I have received, guided by the

Director of the Kew Observatorv, and the kindness which the British Asso-
       REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                                  XXxiii

ciation has shown me in their magnificent Meeting. I shall never forget the

help afforded to me in so many different "ways, and I desire earnestly to put

it in immediate contribution towards the advancement of science.

" The Observatory of Coimbra inust have in its library, as a memorial, the

valuable collection of Transactions of the British Association, and I hope that

you may be so land as to put me in the way of obtaining these volumes.

                       " I remain, dear Sir,

                       " Sincerely yours,

"J. P. Gassiot, Esq."  " Jacixtho A. de Souza."

   The request of this letter has been complied with by the Council of the
Association, and a complete set of the Transactions has been dispatched to

Coimbra.

   The Director of the Lisbon Observatory has since requested the Committee
to superintend the construction of a set of self-recording Magnetographs.
The Committee, in complying with his request, have made arrangements for
the instruments at present exhibited in the International Exhibition, and

these will afterwards be mounted at the Kew Observatory for inspection and

verification.

  A Differential Declinometer for the Government Observatory at Mauritius

has been verified and forwarded to Prof. Meldrum, who has received it in

safety.

   Lieut. Rokeby, of the Royal Marines, already favourably known by a me-
teorological register very carefully kept at Canton during its occupation by the

British troops, has received instruction at Kew in the use of magnetical in-

struments, and has been furnished with a Dip Circle, a Unifilar, a Bifilar,
and a Differential Declinometer, of which the constants have been deter-
mined at the Observatory. Lieut. Rokeby proposes to employ these instru-
ments at the Island of Ascension during his term of service at that station.

He has also been furnished by Admiral FitzRoy with a complete equipment

of the meteorological instruments supplied by the Board of Trade. The
importance of Ascension as a magnetical station has long been recognized.
Situated very nearly on the line of no magnetic dip, the determination
of the periodical variations and of the secular changes of the three mag-
netic elements cannot fail to possess a high value ; and as a meteorological
station, a rock in the mid-ocean, within 6° of the Equator, presents an almost
unrivalled locality for an exact measure of the amount of the lunar atmo-
spheric tide, and of the variations in direction and force of the trade-wind.
The Admiralty, apprised of Lieut. Rokeby's meritorious purposes, have sanc-
tioned the appropriation of the officers' quarter at the summit of the Green
Mountain, known as the " Mountain House," as an observatory ; and the
department of the Board of Trade, under Admiral FitzRoy's superintendence,
has authorized the expenditure of .£50 in providing the additional accommo-
dation required for the instruments. Lieut. Rokeby has arrived at Ascension
with the instruments uninjured, and writes in strong terms of the support
he receives from Captain Barnard, the commander of the troops on the island.

   On June 19th the Chairman received a letter from the Astronomer Royal,

in which he stated that he was very desirous of comparing the Greenwich

records of the vertical-force magnet with those at Kew ; and that, if agree-

able to the Committee, he would request Mr. Glaisher to endeavour to arrange

a meeting with Mr. Stewart for that purpose.
   The Chairman immediately replied, offering every facility, and Mr. Glaisher

has since visited the Observatorv, where the comparison has been made.

       --REPORT 1862.

   The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-
tinue to be made, and the self-recording magnetographs are in constant
operation under the zealous superintendence of Mr. Chambers, the Mag-

netical Assistant.

    Major-General Sabine, Pres. R.S., has laid before the Royal Society a paper
entitled " Notice of some conclusions derived from the Photographic Records

of the Kew Declinometer in the years 1858, 1859, 1860, and 1861."

   The exceedingly good definition which the labours of the late Mr. "Welsh
procured for the magnetic curves, has also enabled the Superintendent,
Mr. Stewart, to discuss the disturbance-curves by a peculiar method, depend-
ing on such definition ; and he has presented a paper to the Royal Society

" On the forces which are concerned in producing the larger magnetic dis-

turbances."

   The Committee are at present engaged in investigating the best means of

--multiplying copies of these curves, and exhibit to the Association two prints

from such one kindly taken by Sir Henry James by his process, and the
other taken by that of Mi*. Paul Pretsch.

   The expense incurred by Mr. Pretsch has been defrayed by <£25 obtained
from the Government Grant through the Royal Society.

   The Chairman of the Balloon Committee having applied to the Super-
intendent for the instruments used by the late Mr. Welsh in his ascents,
these were delivered over to Mr. Criswick on the 12th of March last, having
been previously verified at the Observatory.

   The Meteorological work of the Observatory continues to be performed in
a satisfactory manner by Mr. George Whipple, and each Member of the Staff
of the Observatory seems much interested in the duties he is called upon to

discharge.

   During the past year 184 Barometers and 282 Thermometers have been
verified ; and, to give an idea of the amount of this kind of work which has
been accomplished since first the subject was commenced in the year 1854, it

may be stated that no fewer than 1185 Barometers and 6429 Thermometers

have been verified up to this date.
   Rear- Admiral FitzRoy having been informed of the existence at the Ob-

servatory of a Barograph invented and used by Mr. Ronalds, the following
letter was addressed by him to the Chairman :

                                                       {Copy.)

                                     " Board of Trade (and Admiralty) Meteorological Department,
                                                 2 Parliament Street, London, S.W., 7th April, 1862.

  --" Sir, I have the honour to address you as Chairman of the Kew Com-

mittee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, on behalf
of this branch department of the Board of Trade and the Admiralty.

   "I am authorized to request that you will allow us to endeavour to

benefit by your regidar photographic self- registration of the Barometer at the

Kew Meteorological and Magnetical Observatory during at least one com-

plete year of continuous record, by causing this office to be furnished with

copies of photographic tracings, or their results, in full detail.

   " The objects specially in view here, are :
   "Such accurate and indisputable continuous delineation of atmospheric

pressure, or (rather) tension, as can only be obtained by perfectly reliable
means ; and

    " Such details of occasional oscillations, or pulsations (so to speak), as can
best be obtained photographically.
--;

              REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.      XXXV

   " For practical daily purposes, a self-registering Barometer, on the Milne

principle, may be sufficient ; but for elaborate analysis of atmospherical con-

ditions and changes, in connexion with the numerous influences operating,
some occasionally, some frequently, others always, in the air and its ever-

restless currents, such an apparatus as that now available at Kew would

appear to be indispensable.
    " Besides ordinaiy meteorological peculiarities, the direction of magnetic

earth-currents, the occurrence of magnetic storms, the differing electrical
conditions of various currents of air, the phenomena of earthquakes, and
their ' lightnings ' *, seem to be more or less in certain relations to atmo-

spheric tension, and therefore to require a close and unbroken barometrical

registration. Towards some additional expense incurred by the Kew Ob-
servatory in complying with this request, I am authorized to say that this

department will contribute, on principle similar to that of verification of

instruments.

' Particular Plans,' would be convenient."

" John Peter Gassiot, Esq., F.B.S.,

   Chairman of the Kew Committee of the

                  British Association."

   To which the Chairman shortly afterwards replied in the following

terms :

 --" Sm, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 7th

inst., addressed to me as Chairman of the Kew Committee of the British

Association.

   " On behalf of this Committee, I may state in reply that it will afford us
much satisfaction to furnish your department with Photographic Self-
registrations of the state of the Barometer at Kew Observatory.

   " I am informed by Mr. Stewart, our Superintendent, that we have in our

possession an instrument well calculated, with some slight alterations, to
produce the results you desire.

    " It possesses a compensation for temperature ; besides which, it will be

placed, when finally in action, in a room where the daily range of tempera-
ture is not more than half a degree Fahrenheit.

    " This instrument is not yet, however, in working order, and two months

may perhaps elapse before it is quite ready. As you seem to think it de-

sirable to obtain occasionally curves on an enlarged scale, it will be matter for

our consideration whether this can be managed, and how. Tou will be duly
informed of our resolution ; but, in the mean time, I may state that it
would be somewhat more than two months before such additional curves

could be ready. In conclusion, without binding ourselves to any specified
time (which, indeed, would not be desirable in a matter of this nature), I beg-

to assure you that we shall do all in our power to hasten the desired residt
and, as we hope to have things ready in the course of two or three months,

" Rear-Admiral FitzRoy, F.R.S., $c."

The Mechanical Assistant being engaged at the Exhibition, it was found

impossible to complete the alterations alluded to quite so soon as anticipated ;

but a curve was procured about the middle of August, which was sent to

Admiral FitzRoy, and approved of by him.

The Barograph has since received some further alterations, with a view to

increase its stability and general efficiency. These are now completed, and

the instrument will be henceforth kept in constant operation. One of the

curves from this instrument is presented to the Association.

Arrangements were made for recording photographically, by means of the

Heliograph, the transit of Mercury which took place on the 12th of Novem-

ber lost, but the weather proved unfavourable. This instrument was also

in readiness for the partial eclipse of the sun which took place on the 31st

of December last ; but, owing to the unfavourable state of the sky, only two

Aimperfect pictures were obtained.  very good series of sun-pictures was

obtained by Mr. Beckley during the months of November and December.

  The Heliograph was sent from Kew at the beginning of January to Mr. De

la Rue's Observatory, and Mr. Reckley attended at Cranford to assist in

erecting and adjusting it to focus ; but the weather was so unfavourable

during the remainder of that montli that no pictures of the sun could be

obtained. It had somewhat improved about the 7th of February, when the

first photograph was taken, and since then others have been obtained by
Mr. Reynolds (Mr. De la Rue's assistant) on every day on which this has

been possible. Altogether, up to the 12th of September inclusive, 177 pho-

tographs have been taken on 124 days, namely :

   From February 7th to September 12th inclusive there are 218 days ; so that
on the average one photograph was procured for 1-77 day. Nearly half of

the pictures have been obtained by taking advantage of breaks in the clouds,

and many have been taken through haze. In several of the photographs,
owing to the unpropitious state of the atmosphere, there is a want of that

beauty and perfection which the Heliograph is capable of affording ; but all

the pictures are sufficiently perfect for measurement by means of Mr. De la
Rue's Micrometer. Many of these are extremely perfect, and all would have

been so had the state of the atmosphere permitted.
                                                                              ----

                                                                              REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.  XXXVU

During the month of August Dr. Sahler, Director of the Observatory of

Wilna in Russia, resided at Cranford, and received instruction in Astrono-

Amical Photography.                                                           Photohcliograph is being constructed for him under

Mr. De la Rue's superintendence by Mr. Dallmeyer, and a Micrometer by the

Messrs. Simms. This Heliograph will embody all the optical and mechanical

improvements suggested by the experiments with the Kew instrument ; and

it is expected that the Wilna apparatus will be in operation in the spring

of 1863. In the event of the Kew Heliograph being worked continuously,

Sir John Herschel's suggestion that daily records of the sun should be taken
by means of photography will therefore be carried out both in England and

Russia ; if this were done in one or two other localities, a considerable

amount of information would be obtained respecting physical changes con-

tinually occurring on the sun's surface.

The experience obtained during the past year has been such as to lead

Mr. De la Rue to recommend that photographic records should be continued
for a series of years at some public Observatory. The Committee have had

in consideration whether this could be done at Kew without interfering with

the other work, and have come to the conclusion that the Heliograph might
be worked at an annual expense of £200, which sum would cover the cost of

an additional Assistant, who might at the same time do the other photogra-

phic work of the Observatory.

The old dome formerly used for the Heliograph is so inconveniently situ-

ated as to be quite unfit for such work, and it will be necessary to niako

some addition to one of the present out-buildings in order to contain the in-

strument. The cost of this structure is estimated at £100.

The Committee strongly recommend that the General Committee of the

Association take such steps as they may consider advisable for carrying this

desirable object into practical effect.

The self-recording Electrometer of Prof. W. Thomson continues in con-

stant operation.

Mr. Francis Galton having made arrangements in the Observatory Park for

testing sextants, the Observatory is now prepared to receive such instruments
for examination, and to issue certificates to such as may fulfil the conditions

of any of the following classes :

A. Sextants of the highest order of workmanship for lunar observations

and general service, on shore as well as at sea.

   B. Sextants for naval surveys and for the determination of altitudes with

as much precision as is available at sea.

C. Quadrants or sextants to be used without telescopes, for the determina-

tion of altitudes with an exactness equal to the requirements of general

navigation.

  AThe charges for examination under classes and B will be 5s., under class
AC, Is. ; and the minute constant errors of instruments under class will be

determined, when desired, at an additional charge of 5s.

   Eight sextants have been verified at Kew since the last Meeting of the

British Association.

   The Observatory has been honoured with a visit from the following distin-
guished men of science, who had visited this country in consequence of the

International Exhibition :

Professors Dove, Magnus, and Quincke, of Berlin ; Professor Forchbammer,

of Copenhagen                                                                 Professors Bunsen, Kirchhoff, and Eisenlohr, of Heidelberg;

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE.  XXXIX

Kharkof ; Professors Clausius and Wartinann, of Geneva ; Captain Belavenetz,
Russian Navy ; and Captain Skariatine, Russian Marines.

  A reference to the annexed financial statement will show that, although

the expenditure has exceeded the income, the Observatory has been conducted
with the utmost regard to economy.; and the Committee recommend that for

the ensuing year a sum of £600 should be granted, which, with other

amounts to be received, will, it is expected, meet the necessary requirements.

Report of the Parliamentary Committee to the Meeting of the British
                        Association at Cambridge, October 1862.

   The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as follows :
   The Bishop of Oxford, in furtherance of the resolution adopted at Liverpool
in 1854, must be deemed to have vacated his seat in this Committee, but we
recommend that he should be re-elected.
 * Your Committee have also to report that Mr. James Heywood has not
found it necessaiy to call upon them to interfere in the matter referred to

--Gentlemen of the British Association, I have the honour to announce to

you that we are now opening the Thirty-second Meeting of the British Asso-

ciation, and are for the third time assembled in this University.
   At its first coming hither in 1833 its organization was scarce completed, its

first Meeting having been devoted to explanations, discussions, and allotment
of work to willing labourers ; its second Meeting, to the reception of the first
instalment of those admirable preliminary Keports which served as the founda-
tion of its future labours, and to the division of scientific communications to
the Sectional Committees.

   But it was at Cambridge that the original plan of the Association bore fruit,
by the receipt of the first paper which contained the results of experiments
instituted expressly at the request of the Association. The success of the

Association was now confirmed by the number of compositions and annual
subscriptions paid in, and by the help of these funds a most important measure

was introduced, namely, the practice of granting, in aid of philosophical
researches to be undertaken by individuals or committees at the request of
the Association, sums of money to meet the outlay required for apparatus or

other expenses, which could not be asked from persons who were otherwise
willing to devote their time to the advancement of science. It was at Cam-

bridge that the importance and authority of the Association had become so
manifest, that the first of its applications for Government assistance towards
scientific objects was immediately complied with by a grant of £500 to reduce
the Greenwich Observations of Bradley and Maskelyne. At the third Meeting
improvements were made in the distribution of the Sciences to the Sections,
and a Section of Statistics added. The only change in this respect that was
subsequently found necessary was the establishment of a separate Section for
Mechanical Science applied to the Arts, in 1837. The employment of alpha-
betical letters to distinguish the Sections had been introduced in 1835.

   I have said enough to claim for the Cambridge Meeting the honour of com-

pleting the development of the Association ; and I may be permitted to quote

from our fourth Report the gratifying assurance, that so obvious was the
utility of the proposed undertaking, that, in its very infancy, there were found
several distinguished individuals, chiefly from the University of Cambridge,
who volunteered to undertake some of the most valuable of those Reports
which appeared in the first volume of the Proceedings.

   With a mixture of regret and shame I confess, that although my name is

enrolled in the honourable list of those who undertook Reports, it will be

                                                                     d2

sought in vain amongst those who promptly performed their promises. Yet
I may he permitted to say that I still hope to be enabled at some future time

to complete the Eeport on Acoustics, of which I delivered merely an oral
sketch at the second Meeting of the Association, in 1832.

    The Association quitted Cambridge to pursue, with its matured organization,
and with continually increasing stability and influence, the career of brilliant
and useful labours in every branch of Science that it has never ceased to run
during the two-and-thirty years that have elapsed since its foundation. It
revisited Cambridge after an interval of twelve years, in 1845 ; and now, after
a lapse of seventeen years, we have the high gratification of welcoming once
more the Association to this scene of its early meetings.

    This appears a fitting occasion for a concise review of the leading principles

and prominent labours of the body.
    Scientific Societies, as usually constituted, receive and publish papers which

are offered to them by individuals, but do not profess to suggest subjects for
them, or to direct modes of investigation, except in some cases by offering
prizes for the best Essay in some given branch.

    This Association, on the contrary, is not intended to receive and record
individual originality. Its motto is, suggestion and cooperation, and its
purpose is thus to advance science by cooperation, in determinate lines of
 direction laid down by suggestion.

    To give form and authority to this principle, the admirable conception of
suggestive Eeports was in the first place developed ; a collection that should

 constitute a general survey of the Sciences as they stood at the foundation of

the Association, each branch reported by some member who had already shown
his devotion to the cultivation of it by his own contribution to its advance-

 ment, and each Eeport passing in review its appointed subject, not for the
purpose of teaching it, but of drawing forth the obscure and weak places of
 our knowledge of it, and thus to lay down the determinate lines of direction

for new experimental or mathematical researches, which it was the object of

 the Association to obtain.

    The requests for these Eeports were zealously responded to, and so rapidly
 that at the second Meeting ten were received, and at the third eight others.
 In this manner in five or six years the cycle of the Sciences was well nigh
 exhausted ; but the series of such Eeports has been maintained in succeeding
 years, even to the present time, by the necessity of supplemental Eeports, to
 point out not merely the advances of each science already treated, but the
 new lines of direction for inquiry that develope themselves at every step in

 advance.

    The Eeports thus described were entitled " On the progress and desiderata
 of the respective branch of Science," or " On the state of our knowledge re-

 specting such Science," and must be considered as merely preparations for
 the great work for which the Association was formed. They constitute the
 suggestive part of the scheme : the cooperative mechanism by which each

 new line of research recommended in the Eeports was to be explored, was
 energetically set in motion by the annual appointment of Committees or indi-
 viduals to whom these especial investigations were respectively assigned, with

 adequate sums at their disposal.
     These Committees were requested to report their labours from year to year,

 and thus a second set of documents have been produced, entitled " Eeports of
  Eesearches undertaken at the request of the Association," which are entirely
 distinct from the " suggestive Eeports," but immediately derived from them,

 and complementary to them.
ADDRESS.  liii

    Such is a concise view of the system at first laid down by the wisdom of
our founders, and which, with some modifications, has produced the inestimable
contents of our printed volumes. In practice the " suggestive Report " is
often a paper contributed by some able investigator to some meeting of the
Association, which produces a request from the body that he will pursue his
researches with their sanction and assistance, and write a Report comple-
mentary to his own suggestions.

   Again, although we did not profess to receive and publish individual re-
searches, the number of these received at each meeting is very great ; the

merit of some of them so eminent, that they are authorized to be printed
entire amongst the Reports ; and the Notices and Abstracts of the remainder,

which at first occupied a small proportional part of each volume, now occupy

nearly half of it.

   I will now direct your attention to the principal objects to which our funds

have been directed.

   To appreciate the value of an investigation by the money it costs, may ap-

pear at first sight a most unworthy test, although it be a thoroughly British

view of the subject.
    But there are undoubtedly a great number of most important inquiries in

science that are arrested, not for want of men of zeal and ability to carry them
out, but because from their nature they require an outlay of money beyond
the reach of the labourers who ardently desire to give their time and thoughts

to them, and because the necessity and value of the proposed investigation are

wholly unappreciable by that portion of society who hold the purse-strings.

    But it is in the cases above alluded to of expensive investigation that the
direct use and service of our body has been made the most manifest. The

British Association holds its own purse-strings, and can also perfectly under-
stand when they should be relaxed. Nay, more, by its influence and cha-
racter, established by the disinterested labours and successful exertions of
more than thirty years, it may be said to command the national funds ; for

the objects in aid of which Government assistance has been requested, have
been so judiciously chosen, that such applications have very rarely been un-

successful, but have been, on the contrary, most cordially acceded to.

   Indeed it may be observed, that from the period of the foundation of the

Association the Government of this country has been extending its patronage

of Science and the Arts. "We may agree with the assertion of our founder,

Sir David Brewster, in supposing that this change was mainly effected by the
interference of this Association and by the writings and personal exertions of
its members.

   For the above reasons it appears to me that by a concise review of the

principal objects to which the funds of our body have been applied, and of

those which its influence with the Government has forwarded, we obtain a

measure of the most important services of the British Association.
   But in considering the investigations carried out by committees or indi-

vidual members by the help of the funds of the Association, it must always
be remembered that their labours, their time and thoughts, are all given

gratuitously.

   One of the most valuable gifts to Science that has proceeded from our
Association is the series ofits printed Reports, now extended to thirty volumes.
Yet these must not be supposed to contain the complete record even of the

labours undertaken at the request and at the expense of the body. Many of

these have been printed in the volumes of other societies, or in a separate
form. Several, unhappily, remain in manuscript, excluded from the public

by the great expense of publication.
--liv REPORT- 1862.

  I am the more induced to direct attention to this'great work at present because
I hold in my hand the first printed sheets of a general Index to the series

from 1831 to 1860, by which the titles and authors of the innumerable
Memoirs upon every possible scientific subject, which are so profusely but
promiscuously scattered through its eighteen thousand pages, are reduced to
order, and reference to them rendered easy. This assistance is the more

necessary because so many investigations have been continued with inter-
missions through many years, and the labour of tracing any given one of them

from its origin to its termination through the series of volumes is extremely

perplexing.

   For this invaluable key to the recorded labours of the Association we are
indebted to Professor Phillips, and the prospect of its speedy publication may
be hailed as a great subject of congratulation to every member of our body.

    In every annual volume there is a table of the sums which have been paid
from the beginning on account of grants for scientific purposes. The amount
of these sums has now reached .£20,000 ; and an analysis of the objects to
which this expenditure is directed will show that if we divide this into eighteen
parts, it will appear, speaking roughly, that the Section of Mathematics and
 Physics has received twelve of these parts, namely two-thirds of the whole
 sum, the Sections of Geology and Mechanical Science two parts each, while
 one part has been given to the Section of Botany and Zoology, and one divided
 among the Sections of Chemistry, Geography, and Statistics.

    The greater share assigned to the first Section is sufficiently accounted for
 by the number and nature of the subjects included in it, which require innu-
 merable and expensive instruments of research, observatories, and expeditions

 to all parts of the globe.

    If we examine the principal subjects of expenditure, we find, in the first
 place, that more than £1800 was expended upon the three Catalogues of Stars,
 namely, the noble Star Catalogue, which bears the name of the British Asso-

 ciation, commenced in 1837, and completed in eight years, and the Star
 Catalogues from the observations of Lalande and Lacaille, commenced in 1835
 and 1838, and reduced at the expense of the British Association, but printed
 at the expense of Her Majesty's Government. £150 was applied principally
 to the detennination of the Constant of Lunar Nutation, under the direction
 of Dr. Robinson, in 1857, and to several other minor Astronomical objects.

    At the very first Meeting at York, the perfection of Tide Tables, Hourly

 Meteorological Observations, the Temperature of the atmosphere at increasing
 heights, of Springs at different depths, and observations on the Intensity of
 Terrestrial Magnetism, were suggested as objects to which the nascent organi-
 zation of the Association might be directed.

     Its steady perseverance, increasing power and influence as successive years
 rolled on, is marked by the gradual carrying out of these observations, so as
 to embrace nearly the whole surface of the globe.

     Thus, under the direction of Dr. Whewell, a laborious system of observations,

 obtained by the influence and reduced at the expense of the Association, who
 aided this work with a sum of about £1300, has determined the course of the

  Tide-wave in regard to the coasts of Europe, of the Atlantic coast of the

 United States, of New Zealand, and of the east coast of Australia. Much

  additional information has been since collected by the Admiralty through
 various surveying expeditions ; but it appears that much is still wanting to
  complete our knowledge of the subject, which can only be obtained by a vessel
  specially employed for the purpose.

     More than £2000 have been allotted to Meteorology and Magnetism, for
  the construction of instruments, and the carrying out of series of observations
ADDRESS.                                                                 IV

and surveys in connexion with them. To this must be added a sum of between

.£5000 and £6000 for the maintenance of Kew Observatory, of which more

anon. The advance made in these important sciences, through the labours
of the Committees of the British Association, may be counted among the

principal benefits it has conferred.

   To the British Association is due, and to the suggestion of General Sabine,

the first survey ever made for the express purpose of determining the positions
and values of the three Isomagnetic Lines corresponding to a particular epoch

over the whole face of a country or state.
   This was the Magnetic Survey of the British Islands, executed from 1834

to 1838, by a Committee of its members, General Sabine, Prof. Phillips, Sir
J. Boss, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Lloyd, acting upon a suggestion brought before
the Cambridge Meeting in 1833. It was published partly in the volume for
1838, and partly in the Philosophical Transactions for 1849. This was
followed by a recommendation from the Association to Her Majesty's Govern-
ment, for the equipment of a naval expedition to make a magnetic survey in
the southern portions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This recom-

mendation, concurred in by the Boyal Society, gave rise to the voyage of Sir
James Clark Boss in the years 1839 to 1843. In a similar manner was sug-

gested and promoted the magnetic survey of the British possessions in North

America, authorized by the Treasury in 1841 ; the completion of the magnetic
survey of Sir James Boss, by Lieutenant Moore and Lieutenant Clark in 1845,

in a vessel hired by the Admiralty ; the magnetic survey of the Indian Seas,

by Captain Elliot, in 1849, at the expense of the Directors of the East India
Company ; and the magnetic survey of British India, commenced by Captain
Elliot in 1852, and completed between 1855 and 1858 by Messrs. Schlagint-
weit. Finally, in 1857 the British Association requested the same gentlemen

who had made the survey of the British Islands in 1837, to repeat it, with a

view to the investigation of the secular changes of the magnetic lines. This

has been accomplished, and its results are printed in the new volume for 1861 *.

The Association also, aided by the Boyal Society, effected the organization

in 1840 of the system of simultaneous Magnetical and Meteorological Obser-

vatories, established as well by our own Government as by the principal foreign

Governments at different points of the earth's surface, which have proved so

eminently successful, and have produced results fully equalling in importance

and value, as real accessions to our knowledge, any anticipations that could

have been formed at the commencement of the inquiry f.

General Sabine, whose labours have so largely contributed to these inves-

tigations, has given to the University an admirable exposition of the results

during the present year, in the capacity of Sir Bobert Bede's Lecturer.

In 1854, in consequence of representations originating with the British

Association, our Government created a special department, in connexion with
the Board of Trade, under Admiral FitzBoy, for obtaining Hydrographical and

Meteorological observations at sea, after the manner of those which had been

for some years before collected by the American Government at the instance

and under the direction of Lieut. Maury.

Observations on the wind have been carried on by means of the various

self-registering Anemometers of Dr. "Whewell, Mr. Osier, Dr. Bobinson, and

Mr. Beckley, which instruments have been improved, tested, and thoroughly

brought into practice by the fostering care of our body ; and by the aid of

its funds, experiments have been made on the subterranean temperature of

deep mines ; and on the temperature and other properties of the Atmosphere

at great heights hy means of Balloon Ascents. Four of these were made in

1852, in which heights between nineteen and twenty thousand feet were

reached. But in the present year Mr. Glaisher has attained an altitude of

Wenearly thirty thousand feet.   may hope that some account of this daring

achievement, and its results to science, may be laid before the Association at

its present Meeting.

Earthquake shocks were registered in Scotland by a Committee of the

Association, from 1841 to 1844 ; and Mr. Mallet commenced, in 1847, a most

valuable series of Reports on the Pacts and Theory of Earthquake Phenomena

from the earliest records to our own time, which have graced our volumes

even to the one last published.

One of the most remarkable and fruitful events in our history, in relation

to Physical observations, is the grant by Her Majesty, in 1842, of the Obser-

vatory erected at Kew by King George the Third, which had been long standing

useless. It gave to the Society a fixed position, a depository for instruments,

papers, and other property, when not employed in scientific inquiry, and a
place where Members of the Association might prosecute various researches.

This establishment has been, during the twenty years of its existence, gradually

moulded into its present condition of a most valuable and unique establishment

for the advancement of the Physical Sciences.

After the first few years its existence was seriously perilled, for in 1845

the expediency of discontinuing this Observatory began to be entertained

but upon examination, it then appeared that the services to science already

rendered by this establishment, and the facilities it afforded to Members of

the Association for their inquiries, were so great as to make it most desirable

to maintain it. Again, in 1848, the burthen of continuing this Observatory

in a creditable state of efficiency pressed so heavily upon the funds of the Asso-

ciation, then in a declining state, that the Council actually recommended its

discontinuance from the earliest practical period. This resolution was hap-

pily arrested.

   In 1850 the Kew Committee reported that the Observatory had given to

science self-recording instruments for electrical, magnetical, and meteorolo-

gical phenomena, already of great value, and certainly capable of great further

improvement ; and that if merely maintained as an Experimental Observatory,

devoted to open out new physical inquiries and to make trial of new modes

of research, but only in a few selected cases to preserve continuous records of
passing phenomena, a moderate annual grant from the funds of the Associa-

tion would be sufficient for this most valuable establishment for the advance-
ment of the Physical Sciences.

   In this year it fortunately happened that Lord J. Russell granted to the
Royal Society the annual sum of .£1000 for promoting scientific objects, out

--of which the Society allotted £100 for new instruments to be tried at Kew,
   the first of a series of liberal grants which have not only very greatly con-

tributed to the increasing efficiency of the establishment, but have ensured

its continuance. It now contains a workshop fitted with complete tools, and

a lathe and planing machine, &c. by which apparatus can be constructed and

repaired, and a dividing engine for graduating standard thermometers, all
presented by the Royal Society. The work done, besides the maintenance

of a complete set of self-recording magnetographs, established in 1857, at
the expense of £250, by the Royal Society, consists in the construction and

verification of new apparatus and in the verification of magnetic, meteorolo-

gical and other instruments, sent for that purpose by the makers. For ex-

ample, all the barometers, thermometers, and hydrometers required by the
ADDRESS.  lvii

 Board of Trade and Admiralty are tested, standard thermometers are gra-
 duated, magnetic instruments are constructed, and their constants determined

for foreign and colonial observatories, and sextants are also verified.

   An example of its peculiar functions is given in the very last Report (1861),
where it appears that an instrument contrived by Professor William Thom-

son, of Glasgow, for the photographic registration of the electric state of the

atmosphere, has been constructed by Mr. Beckley in the workshop of this
Observatory, with mechanical arrangements devised by himself, and that it

has been in constant and successful operation for some time. Those who

have experienced the difficulty of procuring the actual construction of appa-
ratus of this kind devised by themselves, and the still greater difficulty of
conveniently carrying out the improvements and alterations required to per-

fect it when brought into use, will agree that the scientific importance and

utility of an establishment cannot be overrated, in which under one roof are
assembled highly skilled persons not only capable of making and setting to
work all kinds of instruments for philosophical research, but also of gradually

altering and improving them, as experience may dictate.

    The creation of this peculiar Observatory must be regarded as one of the

triumphs of the British Association.

    As far as the Association is concerned, its maintenance has absorbed be-
tween five and six thousand pounds, the annual sum allotted to it from oiir
funds having for each of the last six years reached the amount of .£500.

   The construction of the Photohellograph may be also quoted as an ex-

ample of the facilities given by this establishment for the developing and

perfecting of new instruments of observation.

   A suggestion of Sir John Herschel in 1854, that daily photographs of the

sun should be made, has given birth to this remarkable instrument, which at

first bore the name of the Solar Photographic Telescope, but is now known

as the Kew Photoheliograph. It was first constructed under the direction

of Mr. De la Eue by Mr. Ross. The British Association aided in carrying

out this work by assigning the dome of the Kew Observatory to the instrument,

and by its completion in 1857 in their workshops by Mr. Beckley the as-
sistant ; but the expense of its construction was supplied by Mr. Oliveira,
amounting to .£180. This instrument was conveyed to Spain under the care
of Mr. De la Rue on occasion of the eclipse in 1860, who most successfully

accomplished the proposed object by its means, and it was replaced at Kew

on his return. But to carry on the daily observations for which it was con-
structed requires the maintenance of an assistant, for which the funds of the

Association are inadequate, although it has already supplied more than £200
for that purpose. Mr. De la Rue, in consequence of the presence of the

Heliograph at Kew being found to interfere with the ordinary work of the

establishment, has kindly and generously consented to take charge for the

present of the instrument [and of the observations, at his own Observatory,

where celestial photography is carried on. But it is obvious that the
continuation of these observations for a series of years, which is neces-
sary for obtaining the desired results, cannot be hoped for unless funds are

provided.

    I cannot conclude this sketch of the objects in the Physical Section to
which the funds of the Association have been principally devoted, without
alluding to Mr. Scott Russell's valuable experimental investigations on the
motion and nature of waves, aided by £274.

   If we now turn to Geology we find £2600 expended, of which £1500 were

employed in the completion of the Fossil Ichthyology of Agassiz, and upon
lviii  --report 1862.

Owen's Reports on Fossil Mammalia and Reptiles, with some other researches
on Fossils.

    The remainder was principally devoted to the surveys and measurement,
in 1838, of a level line for the purpose of determining the permanence of the
relative level of sea and land, and the mean level of the Ocean ; and to the

--procuring of drawings of the geological sections exposed in railroad operations

before they are covered up a work which was carried on from 1840 to 1844,
when the drawings were deposited in the Museum of Practical Geology, and
the further continuance of it handed over to the geological surveyors of that

establishment.

    £2300 have been devoted to the carrying out of various important experi-

mental investigations in relation to the Section of Mechanical Science.

    Of this sum £900 were paid between 1840 and 1844, in aid of a most
important and valuable series of experiments on the Forms of Yessels, prin-
cipally conducted by Mr. Scott Russell, in connexion with the experiments
on "Waves. This investigation was ready for press in 1844, but it is greatly

to be regretted that the great expense of printing and engraving it has

hitherto prevented its publication.

    Nearly the same sum has given to us various interesting and instructive

experiments and facts relating to steam-engines and steam-vessels, carried
on by different Committees from 1838 to the present time : amongst which

may be especially noted the application of the Dynamometric instruments of
Morin, Poncelet, and Moseley, to ascertain the Duty of Steam-engines, from

1841 to 1844.
    Experiments on the Strength of Materials, the relative strength of Hot and

Cold Blast Iron, the effect of Temperature on their tensile strength, and on the
effect of Concussion and Vibration on their internal constitution, carried on
principally by our late President and by the late Mr. Eaton Hodgkinson, at
different intervals from 1838 to 1856, have been aided by grants amounting
to £400.

   The remainder of the sum above mentioned was principally devoted to the
experimental determination of the value of Railway Constants, by Dr. Lardner
and a Committee in 1838 and 1841.

    The Section of Botany, Zoology, and Physiology has absorbed about £1400,
of which nearly £900 have been applied to Zoology, partly for the expense
of Dredging Committees for obtaining specimens of Marine Zoology on our

--own coasts and in the Mediterranean and other localities whose useful labours
--have been regularly reported from 1840 to 1861 but principally for zoolo-

gical researches in different districts and countries.

   In Botany may be remarked the labours of a Committee, consisting of
Professors Daubeny and Henslow and others, formed in 1840, to make expe-
riments on the preservation of Vegetative Powers in Seeds ; who continued

their work for sixteen successive years, reporting annually, and assisted by a
sum of £100. The greatest age at which the seeds experimented upon was
found to vegetate was about forty years.

   Another Committee, with Mr. Hunt, was engaged during seven years, from
1841, in investigating the influence of coloured light on the germination of
seeds and growth of plants.

    These are specimens of the admirable effect of the organization of our Asso-
ciation in stimulating and assisting with the funds the labours of investi-

gators in new branches of experimental inquiry.
   It would occupy too much time to particularize a variety of interesting

researches in the remaining sections of Chemistry and in the sections of
                                                                                   ADDRESS.                Hx

signed.

The newly issued Report of our Manchester Meeting is admirably calcu-

lated to maintain the reputation of the Association. Besides a number of

excellent Reports which are the continuation of researches already published

in our volumes, it contains elaborate and important Reports by Mr. Stewart

on the Theoiy of Exchanges in Heat ; by Dr. Smith and Mr. Milner on

Prison   Diet  and Discipline                                                      by Drs. Schunck, Angus  Smith, and Roscoe on
                                                                                ;

the progress of Manufacturing Chemistry in South Lancashire ; Mr. Hunt on

the Acclimatization of Man ; Dr. Sclater and M. Hochstetter on the Apteryx

of New Zealand ; Professor Phillips and Mr. Birt on the Physical Aspect of

the Moon. Professor Owen contributes a most interesting paper on the

Natives of the Andaman Islands. The President of the Royal Society re-

ports the Repetition Magnetic Survey of England ; and Mr. Fairbairn, our late

President, reports on the Resistance of Iron-Plate Pressure and Impact.

The Transactions of the Sections occupy nearly as much space as the

Reports, and are replete with valuable and original matter, which it would

be impossible to particularize.

  Many of my predecessors in their Addresses have alluded to the most

striking advances that have been made in the various sciences since the last

Meeting ; I will mention a few of these in Astronomy, Chemistry, and

Mechanics.

In Astronomy, M. Delaunay has communicated to the Academy of Sciences

of Paris the results of his long series of calculations in the Lunar Theory,

destined to fill two volumes of the Memoirs of the Academy. The first volume

was published in 1861 ; the printing of the other is not yet begun. This

theoiy gives the expressions for the three coordinates of the moon under an

analytic form, and carries those for longitude and latitude to terms of the

seventh order inclusive, that of Plana extending generally only to terms of

the fifth order. The addition of two orders has required the calculation of
1259 new terms for the longitude, and 1086 new terms for the latitude. It
was by having recourse to a new process of calculation, by which the work was

broken up into parts, that M. Delaunay has been able to advance the calcu-

lation of the lunar inequalities far beyond the limits previously reached.

The Earl of Rosse has given to the Royal Society (in a paper read June 20,

1861) some further account of researches in Sidereal Astronomy carried

on with a Newtonian telescope of six-feet clear aperture. These researches

are prefaced by an account of the process by which the six-feet specula were

made, a description of the mounting of the instrument, and some considera-

Ations relative to the optical power it is capable of.                                                     selection from the

observations of nebulae is given in detail, illustrated by drawings, which con-

vey an exact idea of the bizarrerie and astonishing variety of form exhibited

by this class of cosmical bodies.

Argelander, the eminent director of the Observatory at Bonn, is carrying

on with great vigour the publication of his Atlas of the Stars of the Northern

A·Heavens within 92° of Polar Distance.                                                      large portion of this enormous

work is completed, and two volumes, containing the data from observation

for the construction of the Charts, were recently published. These volumes

contain the approximate places of 216,000 stars situated between the parallels

of 2° south declination and 41° north declination.

Simultaneously with the construction of Star-charts, among which those

of M. Chacornac of the Paris Observatory deserve particular mention, addi-

tions have been made to the number of the remarkable group of small planets
lx REPORT 1862.

between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, their discovery being facilitated by
the use of charts. The last announced, which is No. 74 of the Series, was
discovered on the morning of Sept. 1 of this year, by M. Luther of Bilk, near
Diisseldorf, whose diligence has been rewarded by the discovery of a large

number of others of the same group.
   The present year has been signalized by the unexpected appearance of a

comet of unusual brightness, which, although its tail was far from being as
conspicuous as those of the comets of 1858 and 1861, exhibited about its

nucleus phenomena of a distinct and remarkable character, the records of

which may possibly at some future time aid in the discovery of the nature of

that mysterious action by which the gaseous portion of these erratic bodies

is so strangely affected.

   On an application made by the Council of the Eoyal Astronomical Society,
Government has granted £1000 for the establishment, during a limited period,

under the superintendence of Captain Jacob, of an Observatory at a consi-
derable altitude above the level of the sea, in the neighbourhood of Bombay.
The interesting results of the ascent by Professor Piazzi Smyth a few years
since of the Peak of Teneriffe, for the purpose of making astronomical and
physical observations, suggested to the President and Council of the Society

the desirableness of taking this step.

   In Chemistry, the greatest advance which has been made during the past
year is probably the formation of compounds of Carbon and Hydrogen by the
direct union of those elements. M. Berthelot has succeeded in producing
some of the simpler compounds of carbon and hydrogen by the action of carbon
intensely heated by electricity or hydrogen gas ; and from the simpler com-
pounds thus formed he is able to produce, by a succession of steps, compounds
more and more complex, until he bids fair to produce from inorganic sources
all the compounds of carbon and hydrogen which have hitherto been only
known as products of organic origin. Mr. Maxwell Simpson has also added
to his former researches a step in the same direction, producing some organic
products by a synthetical process. But these important researches will be
fully laid before you in the lecture on Organic Chemistry which Dr. Odling
has kindly promised for Monday evening next.

   Dr. Hofmann has continued his indefatigable researches on Poly-ammo-
nias, as well as on the colouring matters produced from coal-tar. M. Schlae-
sing proposes a mode of preparing chlorine by a continuous process, which
may perhaps become important in a manufacturing point of view. In this

process nitric acid is made to play the same kind of part that it does in the

manufacture of sulphuric acid, the oxides of nitrogen acting together with

oxides of manganese as carriers of oxygen from the atmosphere to the hydro-

chloric acid.

The methods of dialysis announced last year by the Master of the Mint,

and of spectrum analysis are now in everybody's hands, and have already pro-
duced many interesting results.

In Civil or Mechanical Engineering there is nothing very new.

   The remarkable series of experiments carried on at Shoeburyness and else-
where have developed many most interesting facts and laws in relation to

the properties of iron, and its resistance to projectiles at high velocities,

which will doubtless be fully laid before you at some future period ; but in
the present imperfect state of the investigation, and in consideration of the

purpose of that investigation, prudential reasons forbid the complete publi-

Mycation of the facts.  able predecessor in this Chair, who has taken so pro-

minent a part in these experiments, has given an account of some of the
ADDRESS.  lxi

results in a communication to the Royal Institution in May last, and also in
the new volume for 1861 ; and is, as he informs me, engaged with a long

series of experiments on this subject, which, with his experience and ability,

cannot fail to develope new facts, and will, in all probability, ultimately de-

termine the law of penetration.

   In London we may direct attention to the commencement of the Thames
Embankment and to the various works in progress for the concentration of

the Metropolitan Railways ; especially to the proximate completion of the

Underground Railway. The lamentable disaster in the Pens of last summer

has been most ably subdued, but the remedial measures adopted are not fully
completed, and the interests involved are of so great a magnitude and com-

plexity, that it is scarcely possible for this event to be discussed on the pre-
sent occasion with due impartiality.

   The magnificent collection of machinery in the Great Exhibition shows a

great advance in construction ; but this is not the proper occasion to enter in
detail into the various contrivances and processes which it displays.

    Before I conclude I have the painful duty of reminding you that since our

last meeting we have had to deplore the loss of that most illustrious patron

of science and art, His Royal Highness the Prince Consort, the President of
our Association at Aberdeen and the Chancellor of this University. In the

latter capacity he afforded us many opportunities of observing his scientific

attainments and genuine zeal and love for all branches of knowledge : his

gracious kindness and respect to men of science and literature have left an

impression upon us that can never be effaced.
   I must also ask a tribute to the memory of our late Professors of Chemistry

and Botany, both of whom have done in their lifetime excellent good service

to science, and especially to the British Association ; Professor Cumming by
contributing one of the invaluable primary Reports upon which our proceedings
were based, as well as other communications ; Professor Henslow by various

Reports, some of which I have already alluded to. "We have had also to
lament the loss of that able scientific navigator, Sir J. Clark Ross.

   It remains for me to express my sense of the high and undeserved honour
conferred upon me by the position in which you have placed me, and in the

name of the University to welcome you hither, and wish you a prosperous

and fruitful meeting, alike conducive to the progress of science and impulsive

to its cultivation in the place of your reception.

only are found. The discussion of these observations follow the Catalogue

in Appendix I.

Eight accounts of one and thirteen of the second of the meteors visible on

the evening of July 16th, 1861, show those of the Duke of Argyll and Mr.

Frost to have been distinct meteors, succeeding each other with an interval

of more than an hour. The accouuts are embodied in the present Catalogue,

and the results discussed in Appendix I.

Of the meteor August 6th, a further account from excellent observers in

London, has afforded a good determination ; the accounts and their interpre-

tation are presented in the Catalogue and Appendix I.

Numerous accurate observations of shooting-stars of the 10th August, period

1861, too voluminous for separate insertion in the Catalogue, have been col-

lected and examined for accordances, and the accordant observations only

entered in the Catalogue, together with individual observations which ap-

peared of particular interest from among the entire number ; the results of

the accordant observations are tabulated in Appendix I.

          By Mrs. E. Addison, of Gainsford, Durham, this meteor was first seen 2'.)°

       from the horizon, in the direction of the towns Dunkirk or Ostend, upon the
       Greenwich latitude. Mr. J. Howe, of Greenwich, observed the meteor to pass

       within 8° or 9° of his zenith, as may be inferred from the position of a Lyrae

       at the time of the meteor's appearance ; but this is at variance with the ac-
       counts of Mr. Charles Beed at Westminster, and Mrs. Davies at South-

       borough, who describe the meteor in the E. as far from vertical. If we

       assume the meteor to have passed over Duukirk at an altitude of 30°, as seen
       from Gainsford, its height was here 172 miles above the French coast, The
       obstruction of houses on the west side of Whitehall in Mr. Charles Eeed's
       account, shows the meteor to have disappeared nearly due N. from London,

       at an altitude of 10°, pointed out by Mr. Howe at Greeny ich. At Gainsford,

the same point of the path had altitude 20° in due ISCE. The latter lines of
sight approach within eleven miles of each other, eighty-eight miles due E.
of Newcastle, and forty-four miles above the sea. It is probable, from the
account of Mrs. Davies, that the meteor first appeared somewhat S. of the
latitude of Dunkirk, and that the entire path of 395 or 400 miles was per-
formed in not less than ten to twelve seconds of time.

  A similar comparison of the catalogued accounts of this meteor assigns its

path with somewhat greater certainty at 300 miles of length, from 195 miles
over North Foreland to sixty-five miles above the sea, sixty miles S. of Ply-
mouth. The meteor passed the Isle of Wight at a height of 150 miles ; and
here a durable tail first began to be developed from the nucleus. The dura-
tion of the flight was five to six seconds, at the largest estimation.

                      Meteor, 1861, August 6th, llh 21 m p.m. G.M.T.
   The accounts of Mr. Joseph Baxendell at Manchester, and Messrs. T.
Crumplen and J. Townsend at London, determine the centre of this meteor
at eighty miles above a point halfway between Leicester and Birmingham
and, assuming its course to have been direct upon Manchester, a path of 176
miles in five seconds is inferred, from 126 miles above Winchester to twenty-
one miles above the northern point of Staffordshire.

and explosion twenty miles above it, upon the meridian of Land's End. The
flight of 360 miles appears to have occupied seven or eight seconds of time.

                       Meteor, 1861, November 15th, 10h 14m p.m.

   The meteor described by Mr. Nash at Greenwich, and Mr. Herschel at
Shooter's Hill, although identical, do not admit of useful comparison with one

--another, nor with that observed by Mr. Greg at Styall, near Manchester, the

base-line in the former case being too small for such a purpose, and the third
meteor being apparently distinct from the former two.

                        Meteor, 1861, November 19th, 9h 38ffl 30s p.m.

The Ipswich and Norwich accounts place the audible explosion of this bril-

liant meteor at no great height between the two towns ; thirty miles of height

must be allowed to it for the altitude as seen from Exeter, although such a

height is at variance with the view obtained from Greenwich and North Fore-

Iand. It is not impossible that explosion, audible at Norwich and Ipswich,

and perhaps also at North Foreland, may have depressed the last portion of

the flight, for this was hidden from view at Exeter. The near verticality

at North Foreland, the passage over the moon (whose altitude was 3S° E. by

S.) in the eastern parts of Kent, and the low southern position of the nucleus

as first perceived by Messrs. Hill at Woodford, Mitchell and Harmer at Tun-

bridge, and James Rock, jim. at Guestling, show this meteor to have taken a

Anearly meridian and nearly horizontal course.                          flight of 260 miles in 10

or 12 seconds, from fifty-five miles above Paris to thirty miles above Beceles

(between Suffolk and Norfolk), is found to satisfy the whole of the accounts

with considerable accuracy.

                        Meteors, 1861, November 24th, 8h m p.m.

 --The resemblance of these meteors is casual, the lines of sight of com-

mencement lying widely upon opposite sides of the base-line between the

stations, while those of termination approach no nearer than twenty-six miles

upon the southern side of the base-line.

                         Meteors, 1861, December 1st, 9h 15m p.m.

   The resemblance of these meteors is not borne out by the uranographical

--positions assigned to them at the two distant stations, the point of com-

mencement having little or no parallax with considerable deviation of the
lines of sight, while the lines of sight of termination lie upon opposite sides

of the base-line.

                        Meteor, 1861, December 8th, 8h 16m p.m.

   At Dungannon in Ireland this meteor appeared to fall vertically, while at
Wakefield (Yorkshire) it passed overhead. The observation of Dr. Walker at
Birkenhead (Seacombe), assigns Strangford, on the Irish coast, as the spot
between these two towns where the body would have struck the earth. By
Mr. Bedford's account, from Silloth near Carlisle, the height at disappearance

is found to be fifty miles above the sea, halfway from Lancaster to the Isle of

Man                     the height above Wakefield  eighty-five miles,  and  at Hull 110 to 115

miles. Modified by the remaining accounts, a course of 160 miles from 110

miles above Hull to forty-five miles above the Irish Sea, twenty miles E. of
Douglas Town, performed in six or eight seconds of time, appears to be a near

approximation to the truth. It is possible that an explosion loudly heard at

Lancaster and Southport, but not heard at Douglas, may have caused the

deflection by which the meteor in the latter portion of its flight appeared sta-

 tionary at Castletown some seconds. On the 3rd of the same month, a similar     i

 detonating meteor appeared in Germany, bursting sixty miles over Dessan,
 and directed almost from the Pole (see the Calculation of Professor Heis).
 Mr. Greg at this time observed the radiant point of shootiug-stars to lie

 between Gemini and Auriga. On the 24th of December it was in Taurus.

                           Meteors, 1861, December 9th, 5h 30 m p.ar.

    The resemblance is casual. The uranographical position at Hawkhurst
 places this meteor at a great height towards Edinburgh, upon the latitude

 of Glasgow.
                     Shooting-star (F), 1862, January 28th, ll b 4m p.m.

    The base-line of forty miles between the stations of London and Stone
 affords a good determination of this shooting-star. The lines of sight for the
 commencement are only three miles apart at their nearest approach, namely,
 at 44| miles above Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, while those of termi-
 nation are only 2\ miles asunder at 47| miles above Macclesfield in Cheshire.
 The horizontal flight of sixty miles was performed in 11 to li second, by
 careful estimation at the time of the observation. Direction from 32° S. of E.
At 880 yards it would have equalled the full moon.

                           Meteor, 1862, February 2nd, 8h 20m p.m.

    The astronomical accounts of Mr. E. J. Lowe and Mr. Alcock at Beeston
 Observatory and Newark, together with similar details from Tarporley in

 Cheshire, appear to fix the disappearance of this meteor with precision at
fourteen or fifteen miles above Cheadle, on the borders of Derbyshire, where
the meteor arrived after a flight in the air of 236 miles from 190 miles above

Lyme Regis, occupying six seconds of time and directed to earth in the valley

of the Dove, or at the foot of the Peak of Derbyshire. The point of first ap-
pearance in Orion or the Pleiades, as seen at Liverpool and Tarporley, places
this meteor among the few whose true courses are observed to lie from "W". to

E. of the meridian.

                          Meteor, 1802, February 23rd, 9h 25ra p.ir.

    This meteor, which passed nearly over Liverpool towards S.W., appeared to

Mr. W. H. Wood, at Weston-super-Mare, to move 30° horizontally in the N.

at 20° from the horizon. It appears to have sought the earth at Pembroke,
and had its flight from forty miles above Stockport, near Manchester, to twenty
miles above Aberystwith, in Wales.

   The following comparison of the brightness of these meteors is offered as
leading to an estimation of their probable dimensions.

   The photometric tables of the light of certain stars compared with that of
the full moon, published by Sir John Herschel, enable us to compare the light
of ordinary shooting-stars with a standard generally familiar ; and the same

may be done when fireballs are compared in their illuminating power to dif-
ferent phases of the moon ; but the class of meteors intermediate between

these in the scale of brilliancy are usually compared with the planets of whose

light at different phases no tables arc prepared. Among the preceding known

meteors, one only of the latter class (shooting-star e) is found. The follow-
ing deductions aim at no greater accuracy than is commensurate to the cha-

racter of the observations themselves.

          On the Strains in the Interior of Beams.
By George Biddell Airy, F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.

[A communication ordered to be printed among the Eeports.]

The author states that he had long desired to possess a theory which should

enable hira to compute numerically the strains on every point in the interior
of a beam or girder, but that no memoir or treatises had given him the least

assistance*. He had therefore constructed a theory which solved completely

the problems for which he wanted it, and which appears to admit of applica-

tion at least to all ordinary cases.

AThe theory contemplates forees acting in one plane.  beam therefore is

considered as a lamina in a vertical plane, the same considerations applying

to every vertical lamina of which a beam may be conceived to be composed.

The author remarks that it is unnecessary to recognize every possible strain

in a beam. Metallic masses are usually in a state of strain, from circum-

stances occurring in their formation ; but such strains are not the subject of
the present investigation, which is intended to ascertain only those strains

which are created by the weight of the beam and its loads. The algebraical

interpretation of this remark is, that it is not necessary to retain general

solutions of the equations which will result from the investigation, but only

such solutions as will satisfy the equations.

After defining the unit of force as the weight of a square unit of the lamina,

and the measure of compression-thrust or extension-pull as the length of

the ribbon of lamina, whose breadth is the length of the line which is subject

to the transverse action of the compression or tension, and whose weight is

equal to that compression or tension, the author considers the effect of tension,

&c. estimated in a direction inclined to the real direction of the tension, and

Heshows that it is proportional to the square of the cosine of inclination.

then considers the effect of compounding any number of strains of compression

or tension which may act simultaneously on the same part of a lamina, and
shows that their compound effect may in every case be replaced by the com-

pound effect of two forces at right angles to each other, the two forces being

both compressions or both tensions, or one compression and one tension.

Succeeding investigations are therefore limited to two such forces.

Proceeding then to the general theory of beams, it is remarked that if a

curve be imagined, dividing a beam into any two parts, the further part of
the beam (as estimated from the origin of coordinates) may be considered to

be sustained by the forces which act i:i various directions across that curve,

taken in combination with the weight of the further part of the beam, tho

load upon that part, the reaction of supports, &c. Expressing the forces in

conformity with the principles already explained, and supposing that there is

one compression-force B making an angle /3 with y (in the direction of y

diminishing for increase of x), and another compression-force C making an

angle 90° -f fl with y, it is easily seen that the element Ss of the curve, sup-

posed to make the angle with y, sustains the forces

peculiar to that instance.

                                         dx

and forming the equations of equilibrium in the usual way, they will be found

to be--

       +Equation for forces in x, fclx . (Lp M)=0.

Equation for forces in y, JclxQilLp+Q)-- B,=0.

-- =Equation of momenta, fdx(Lyp + M.y + M.xp + Ox) RA 0.

   Now these equations, applying to any curve, will apply to any two curves

very close together ; and therefore their variation, taken by the rules of the
Calculus of Variations, will be 0. The proper equation (in the usual nota-

N--tion) is   * ^ =0. Applying this, the results are

              dM ^_r\

              dy dx

              rfO_^M =Q

              dy dx

From this it follows that (omitting some arbitrary functions which represent

original strains in the formation of the beam) L, M, 0, are partial differential

coefficients of the same function of x and y, which we may call F : so that

              L=_ M=-- 0=--.T d*F ,r d2F

Substituting these, the equations become

   Considerations, of a somewhat detailed character, depending partly on the
relation assumed to exist between tension-force and material extension, are

necessary to show the form which must be assumed for F in the various cases
to be examined. The conditions to be secured are--that the horizontal part

of the thrust, &c. shall be the same as that given by ordinary theories, on the
relation just mentioned ; and that the equations above shall be satisfied. After
due application of these in the following five cases, these forms are found

for F.

treated : in each of the other cases the computations were made for 231 points.

The task which, we have undertaken, at the request of the British Asso-

ciation, is in some degree lightened by the publication, since the last
meeting, of the ' Admiralty Manual for ascertaining and applying the De-
viations of the Compass,' a work which has been compiled under our joint
editorship, and published by the direction of the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty. The publication of this work allows us to treat as known,
various methods and formulae which had not previously been published, and
to which it will be necessary to refer in the sequel. It, however, makes it

necessary that we should give some account of our own work, and this we
think it will be most convenient that we should do at the outset.

    The ' Manual ' is divided into four parts. Part I. contains the well-
known " Practical Bules " published by the Admiralty, drawn up originally,
in 1842, by a committee consisting of the late Admirals Sir F. Beaufort and
Sir J. C. Boss, Captain Johnson, B.N., Mr. Christie, and General Sabine.

--These rules were, and still are, purely practical, the object being to enable

the seaman, by the process of swinging his ship, to obtain a table of the
deviations of his compass on each point, and then to apply the tabular

corrections to the courses steered.

   Part II. is a description of the valuable graphic method known as

" Napier's method," in which the deviations of the compass are represented
by the ordinates of a curve, of which the " courses " or azimuths of the ship's
head which correspond to the deviations are the abscissae. These azimuths

may be measured either from the " correct magnetic north," in which case

they are called the " correct magnetic courses," or from the direction of the

disturbed needle, in which case they are called " compass courses ;" and we

should in general obtain one curve if the abscissae represent one set of courses,

and a different curve if the abscissae represent the other set. It was, we

bebleve, first observed by Mr. J. B. Napier that, by drawing the two sets of
ordinates in proper directions, each may be made to give the same identical

curve, and, conversely, that the same curve may be made to give the devi-

ations as well on the correct magnetic courses as on the compass courses,

with the additional advantage that the one set of courses may be at once

derived from the other by going from the axis of abscissae to the curve, in a
direction parallel to one of the sets of ordinates, and returning to the axis
of abscissae in a direction parallel to the other. The original direction of
each set of ordinates is arbitrary, the scale, however, depending on those
directions. By drawing the ordinates at angles of 60° and 120° from the axis

of abscissae, we have the advantage that the scale along each axis of ordinates

and also along the axis of abscissae is the same ; and these directions are in

general the most convenient, although in particular cases, as when the

deviations are very small, it is convenient to take a larger scale for the ordi-

nates than for the abscissae. The practical advantages of the method are
very great. It enables the navigator, from observations of deviations made
on any number of courses, whether equidistant or not, to construct a curve
in which the errors of observation are, as far as possible, mutually compen-
sated, and which gives him the deviation as well on the compass courses as
on the correct magnetic courses. Various modifications of this method have
been proposed, of which one by Capt. A. P. Byder, B.N., deserves particular

mention from the facility with which it may be used by those to whom the

method is unfamiliar ; but for general use there seems to be no form supe-

rior to the usual form of Napier's diagram.
    Part III. contains the practical application to this subject of mathematical

fornmla? derived from the fundamental equations deduced by Poisson from
Coulomb's theory of magnetism. This part was published separately in the
year 1851, and afterwards as a Supplement to the " Practical Rules " in 1855.
At that time it was considered sufficient to use approximate formulae, going
as far only as terms involving the first powers of the coefficients of deviation.
The very large deviations found in iron-plated ships of war rendering it
desirable to use in certain cases the exact instead of the approximate formulae,

this part has been re-written.

   It may be desirable to give here some account of these formulae.

    Poisson's equations are derived from the hypothesis that the magnetism
of the ship, except so far as it is permanent, is transient induced magnetism,

the intensity of which is proportional to the intensity of the inducing force,
and that the length of the compass-needle is infinitesimal compared to the

distance of the nearest iron.

   On this hypothesis the deviation of the compass is represented exactly by

one or other of the following formulae :

B + + G+ +sin S=a cos 3+J3 sin ? £ cos f                cos (2p+8) . . (1)

Cof the ship ; $} and coefficients each consisting of two parts, one part a co-

efficient depending on the soft iron and multiplied by the tangent of the dip,

reciprocal of the earth's horizontal force at the place, and by a factor, -,
                                                                                                                 A

generally a little greater than unity, and depending on the soft iron. In

+ --athese equations the sign indicates an easterly,  westerly deviation of the

north point of the compass.

   If the coefficients are so small that their squares and products may be
neglected, the first equation may be put under the form

3=A+B + + Dsin t' C cos £'  sin 2£'+E cos 2£'                         (3)

in which it will be observed that the coefficients are now expressed in arc, the

Eoman letters being nearly the arcs of which the German letters are the sines.

When the deviations do not exceed 20°, this equation is sufficiently exact.

As the subject with which we are now dealing cannot be understood or

followed without distinctly apprehending the meaning of the several parts of

this expression, we do not apologise for pausing to explain them.

It will easily be seen that such an arrangement of horizontal soft iron rods,

such as that in figure 1,

would give ajwsitive value of A, and no other term in the deviation.

+ +Ewould give A to the starboard compass, combined, however, with  ; and
-- --A, combined with E, to the port compass. The last arrangement is one

sometimes found in the relative positions of the horizontal iron spindle of

the wheel and the binnacle compasses placed near it. In compasses placed in

the midship bine of the ship, such unsymmetrical arrangements of soft iron can

Aseldom have any sensible operation. In such cases is always small ; and

when it has a sensible value, it seems more likely to arise from index error of
the compass, or from error of observation, and may probably be best dealt

with as such, and disregarded in the table of deviations.

  +Tbe terms B sin £' C cos £' make up together what is called the " semi-

circular deviation." This is the part of the deviation which it is most

difficult to deal with, as well from each coefficient being made up of the two

parts which we have described, which cannot be distinguished by observa-

tions made in one latitude, as from that part of the ship's magnetism, which

we have treated as permanent, being in fact only subpermanent. To this we

shall have occasion to revert in the sequel. At present we will only point

+out that B indicates an attraction of the north point of the compass to the

--ship's head, B to the stem, +'C an attraction of the north point to the star-
--board side, C to the port side.

metrically arranged soft iron, in which the ship's head is supposed to be

same arrangements, the ship's head being now supposed to be directed to the

right or left of the page.

   Between these various arrangements there is this most important dif-
ference, that in No. 1 and No. 4 the directive force of the needle would be
increased, while in No. 2 and No. 5 it would be diminished.
90 REPORT--1862.

might be either increased, or diminished, or left unaltered, according as the
effect of the longitudinal and the transverse iron preponderated. "We may,
therefore, by observing the effect on the directive force, as well as on the

quadrantal deviation, ascertain how much of the latter is caused by fore-and-
aft iron, how much by transverse iron.

    This explanation of the coefficients will probably be sufficient for the

purposes of this Report, and we now revert to Part III. of the ' Manual.'
The principal object of this part is to find the means of computing A, B,

C, D, E, from the deviations observed or derived by Napier's curve for a
certain number (8, 16, or 32) equidistant points. This is easily done by
formulae founded on the method of least squares ; and the method is made of
ready application by tabular forms and tables given in this part.

   The direct computation of the exact coefficients &, 33, C, 13, <B by the
method of least squares would be a matter of very great labour ; but they
are easily derived to terms of the 3rd order inclusive from the approximate

Ecoefficients A, B, C, D, by formulae which are given for the first time in

this part.

   There are two other coefficients, the knowledge of which is of great
importance, but which can only be derived from observations of force, viz. X,
or the ratio of the mean force to north at the place of the compass to the
earth's horizontal force, and fi, the ratio of the mean vertical force at the
same place to the earth's vertical force.

   One of the most important errors in the modern iron-built and iron-
plated vessels is the heeling error. The deviations obtained by the usual pro-
cess of swinging are for a vessel on an even keel. It is found by experience

that as the vessel heels to one or other side, the north point of the compass
is drawn either to the weather or lee side, generally the former ; and the

deviation so produced, when the ship's course is near north or south, often
exceeds the angle of heel. This not only produces a deviation which may

cause a serious error in the ship's course, but if the ship is rolling, and par-
ticularly if the period of each roll approximates to the period of oscillation of

the compass, produces a swinging of the compass-needle, which may amount
to many times the angle of heel, and make the compass for the time useless

for steering.

   This is a part of the deviation which has been involved in some obscurity.
Mr. Airy, in a paper in the · Transactions of the Institution of Naval
Architects,' vol. i. p. 107 (1860), says that the disturbance produced by
heeling has not been well observed, and its correction has not yet been
reduced to easy laws ; and that the effect of heeling is the only part of the
magnetic disturbance in regard to which the practical correction of the com-
pass is really at fault ; and the Reports of the Liverpool Compass Committee
refer to it as one of the most perplexing parts of the subject. It therefore
appeared to us desirable to deduce from Poisson's formulae, expressions for the
alteration of the coefficients introduced by tbe inclination of the ship. This

has been done in the 'Manual,' and the result is, we think, to remove entirely
the obscurity which rested on the subject. The effect of the heeling error is,

as might have been anticipated, to leave unaltered the coefficients wbich

depend on fore-and-aft action, viz. B and D, to alter C, and to give a value

Ato and E. The latter appear to be, except when the compass is near

either extremity of the vessel, of small amount. The alteration of C is the
only one which is important. The formulas show that it consists of two
parts, which are caused^by arrangements of iron, such as that in the follow-
ing figure, in which the vertical line represents iron permanently magnetized,
  ON THE THREE REPORTS OF THE LIVERPOOL COMPASS COMMITTEE. 91

or vertical iron magnetized by induction, drawing the north end of the needle
downwards in the northern hemisphere ; the horizontal line a rod, such as that

+in fig. 3, No. 2, which would give D, and which, when the ship's head is

                                                                            Fig. 4.

north or south, will have no effect till the ship heels, when its upper (weather)
end will attract the north point of the compass. Each rod in the figure will

therefore cause a deviation of the north point of the needle to the weather
side. In order to correct this, the vertical magnetism must either act
upwards, or the transverse magnetism must be such as would be caused by
a horizontal transverse rod on each side of the compass, the formula indi-
cating the relation which must exist between the vertical and the transverse

horizontal magnetism in order that the heeling error may be zero.

   The 4th Part of the 'Manual' contains charts of the bines of equal
variation, equal dip, and equal horizontal force over the globe ; the first for
the purpose of enabling the navigator at sea to determine the deviation by
astronomical observations ; the two latter to throw light on the changes which
the deviations undergo on a lengthened voyage, and to enable the navigator
to anticipate the changes which will take place on a change of geographical

position.

   Of the Appendices, one (No. 2) contains a short account of the method
proposed by Mr. Airy for the mechanical correction of the semicircular and
quadrantal deviation, and a notice of a method lately proposed by Mr. Evans
for the correction of the quadrantal deviation when excessive. No. 3 is on
the mathematical theory of the deviations of the compass, being the deduction

from Poisson's equations of such formulae as may be most conveniently ap-

plied to the analysis of the tables of deviations derived from actual obser-

vation.

   There is a graphical method of representing the magnetic state of a ship

as regards deviation, described in pp. 106 and 107, which we may shortly

describe.

   If from the centre of a compass, in any part of the ship, we draw a
horizontal line, representing in amount and direction the ship's disturbing

force on the north end of the needle of that compass, the ends of all the
lines so drawn will, as is shown in this appendix, trace out an ellipse. If
the soft iron of the ship be symmetrically distributed, so that <&, and <B are
zero, the construction of this ellipse is simplified, as its axes are then parallel
and perpendicular to the fore-and-aft lines of the ship. The position of the
centre of the ellipse gives the amount of the force to head, and force to side,
which cause the semicircular deviation. The fore-and-aft and transverse
           --                               --;

92                  --report 1862.

axes of the ellipse give the amount of the fore-and-aft transverse inductive

forces which give rise to the quadrantal deviation. An ellipse so drawn,

therefore, gives to the eye, at a glance, the whole magnetic character of the

ship as regards deviation on an even keel.

   If the mean directive force of the needle is not altered, the ellipse be-

comes a circle, the coordinates of the centre of which are 33 and C, and the
radius J3, on the scale in which the mean force to north represents unity.

If we have no observations of horizontal force, the circle is all we can draw

it gives all the information to be derived from the ellipse, except the diminu-

tion of the directive force. For the complete representation of the deviation

and force, it is convenient to have both the circle and the ellipse drawn.

   In the diagrams the direction and force of the earth's magnetism as the
ship is on different azimuths are represented by the radius of a circle, of

which the compass is centre, and which is divided in the reverse order of

Athe compass-card.  line drawn from a point in the circle to the correspond-

ing point in the ellipse or small circle represents, on the common principle of

the parallelogram of forces, the direction and amount of the force on the

Aneedle*. modification of this diagram is described at p. 96 of the ' Manual'

under the name of " dygogram " (dynamo-gonio-gram), applied to it from its

showing the force as well as the angle of deviation of the needle.

   The principle of its construction is the following. If we draw a vertical

line representing the magnetic meridian, and from a given point in it draw

lines representing in length and direction the directive force and direction of

the needle for each azimuth of the ship's head, the extremities of such bines

will trace out an epicycloid which is very easily constructed by points when the
coefficients &, 33, C, 29, <£ are determined. The method is applied in plate 2

to the deviations of the standard compass of the 'Warrior,' and has been

applied by us to many other ships, and has been found a most efficient aid in

discussing the observed deviations"!".

  We now come to what we consider the proper subject of this Eeport,

viz., the practical results as to the deviations of the compass which have

been deduced from actual observation on board ship ; and the works to which

we shall principally confine our attention are the following :

  A* practical application of the diagram to the correction of the compass was suggested

by its being accidentally held to the light and looked at from behind. When this is done,

it will be seen that the large circle is divided in the same way as the compass-card. If,

then, the radius of the large circle represent the direction of the disturbed compass-needle,

the line joining the corresponding points in the large circle and on the ellipse or small
circle will represent the direction of the magnetic meridian.

   By therefore drawing on an ordinary compass-card a circle of which the coordinates of
the centre are --38 and +C, and the additional coordinates of the north point --IB, and
dividing the small circle in the reverse order, we get the following rule for the correction of

the compass :
    " Take the given course on the card, and also on the small circle, and suppose a straight

line drawn through these. Then keep the ship's head in the direction of the line, disre-

garding, of course, the lubber-line."

   Navy" (Phil. Trans. 1860, p. 337).

   The first and most important general result which is derived from all the
observations recorded in these works, and from many more which have not
been published, is, that the observed deviations are represented by the formula?
derived from Poisson's theory with a correctness which is within the limits of

error of observation.

   In saying this, we are in some degree differing from a conclusion which the
Reports of the Liverpool Compass Committee draw from observed deviations,

viz. that there is a difference in the amount of the quadrantal deviation in

different quadrants, depending either on some quality of the iron as regards

its capacity for induction in different directions, or on the greater or less
time occupied in moving the ship's head over one or other of the quadrants.
That some difference may, under certain circumstances, be caused by the latter

cause we do not dispute, but we are not satisfied that it is appreciable in the
ordinary process of swinging. On the contrary, we believe that, within very
small limits of error, Poisson's theory may be considered as exact for the
ordinary process of swinging a ship. As regards more lengthened periods,
particularly when the ship has been exposed to mechanical violence, the

hypothesis no doubt ceases to be exact ; but even then the most convenient
mode of treating the subject is analogous to that which is familiar in physical
astronomy and other mixed sciences, viz. to consider the theory as exact, but
the coefficients derived from that theory as being themselves subject to

changes to be derived from observations, and reduced or not, as the case may

be, to law.

    Mr. Airy, in the first paper to which we have referred, describes very

careful observations made by him on board of two iron ships, the ' Rainbow

iron-built steamer, and the ' Ironsides ' iron-built sailing-ship. In the first,

observations were made at four stations: station 1, near the binnacle'

13 feet 2 in. from the stern ; station 2, at a part in which a standard compass

woidd probably be placed, being 31 feet 9 in. from the stern ; station 3,
48 feet 3 in. from the stern ; station 4, 47 feet from the knight-heads, or

151 § feet from the stern. Each compass was raised 4 feet from the deck.

compass.
        --

94 .REPORT 1862.
   From Mr. Airy's observations we derive the following values for the

coefficients :

The most remarkable features in the deviations of these ships are the very-

small amount of the quadrantal deviation, and also in the ' Rainbow ' the

small diminution of the horizontal force.

   These features led Mr. Airy to the conclusion that the amount of in-

duced magnetism was small, and that nearly the whole of the semicircular

deviation was caused by permanent magnetism. That this was the case as

regards the coefficient C there can be no doubt ; but as regards the Bcoefficient
the case is different, as any part of it may have arisen from the induction in

vertical masses of iron before or abaft the compass.

These results, and the conclusions which Mr. Airy drew as to the amount

of permanent magnetism, were the foundation of his well-known method of
correcting the deviations by means of magnets and soft iron, which has

been so extensively practised in the mercantile marine.

   Another remark may be made on the results. One of the most import-

ant conclusions which have been drawn from the numerous observations

which have been made on the deviation of iron-built vessels is, that, in

a well-selected place for the standard compass, the semicircular devi-

ation depends on the position of the ship in building, the magnetism which

would be assumed if the iron were soft being then, by the process of

--hammering, fixed in the vessel, and a character then impressed which the

ship never afterwards loses, the general result being that the north point

of the compass is attracted to that part of the ship which was south in
+B --building, so that
indicates a ship built head south, B a ship built head

north of the (magnetic) east and west line, -f C a ship built head east, and

-- C a ship built head west of the magnetic meridian. With our present

knowledge, we should have little hesitation in drawing the conclusion from

Mr. Airy's observations, that the ' Rainbow ' was built with her head not
far from N.W., and the 'Ironsides' with her head not far from N.E. At
that time, however, the connexion between the direction of building and the

semicircular deviation was unsuspected*, and the direction in which those ships

   * To this there is one exception, which deserves to be recorded. In the year 1835,
Captain Johnson made elaborate experiments on the magnetism of the iron steam-vessel

  Garry Owen,' the results of which are contained in a paper in the Phil. Trans, for 1836,
p. 267. Captain Johnson ascertained, from observations made on a needle on shore, that

the ' Garry Owen ' acted as a permanent magnet, her head repelling, and her stern

--attracting, the north end of the needle ; and he says, p. 285 : " As, in the construction of

iron vessels, hammering the numerous rivets might elicit magnetic influences, it would be
well to note, by compass, the direction of their heads and sterns when building, with a

view of ascertaining whether (in combination with the former circumstances) any distinct
magnetic properties indicated by those parts are due to the line of direction of the vessel

with respect to the magnetic meridian."

   " The head of the ' Garry Owen,' when building, was W.N.W."
   It may seem singular that Captain Johnson did not observe how nearly this direction
  ON THE THREE REPORTS OP THE LIVERPOOL COMPASS COMMITTEE. 95

were built was probably unknown to Mr. Airy. He suggested that the

particular character of the semicircular deviation in these vessels might be
due to the direction of rolling of the plates of which the ship was composed.
Subsequent experiments, made by the same eminent philosopher, on iron
rolled in different directions, lately communicated to the Eoyal Society, but

not yet published, show, as we understand, that the effect of direction in

rolling, though appreciable in each separate plate, is not great, and probably

has little, if any, appreciable effect in a ship. In concluding our observations

on the paper, we must not omit to say that one of the most valuable parts of

Mr. Airy's paper, viz. the mechanical correction of the deviation, does not, as

we consider, come within the scope of this Report, and that, in passing it over,
we must not be considered as underrating its importance.

   Mi\ Airy's second paper has not that value which is given to the first by
careful observations made by himself on selected ships. It contains a dis-
cussion equivalent to the determination of 33, C, and j9 of the magnetism of
various wood-built and iron-built ships from observations made in various
latitudes, and an endeavour to deduce from such observations the two parts
of which 33 is composed ; but Mr. Airy had the disadvantage which is still

met with by those who attempt the discussion, viz. the want of sufficient

determinations of the deviations of the same iron vessel in different magnetic
latitudes, and he was consequently unable to obtain any very precise evidence
of the amount of the subpermanent magnetism in iron ships, or its change on
a change of latitude.

   The work of Captain Johnson, to which we have referred, is a great store-
house of the results of observations of deviation made on board ships of war.
There are, however, several reasons why it does not require very detailed
mention here. The deviations are chiefly those of wood-built ships. They are,
therefore, generally small and regular. They are not compared with theory,

and do not in all cases furnish sufficient data for the comparison. Such
comparison as can be made will, as regards iron-built vessels, be found in
Mr. Evans's paper in the Phil. Trans, of 1860, referred to above.

   It is to Dr. Scoresby that we are indebted for the observation that the
semicircular deviation of iron ships is chiefly due to their position when

building.

   In considering this subject, there are one or two points which must be

borne in mind. Supposing, as we may no doubt do, that the iron is, as

regards position and quality, symmetrically placed on each side of the midship

line, we may consider separately the permanent or subpermanent magnetism

caused by fixing, first, the magnetism induced by the horizontal force, and
secondly, that induced by the vertical force. As regards C, the same reasoning
which shows that it cannot arise from transient induced magnetism also shows
that it cannot be caused by the fixing any vertically induced magnetism, but
must arise either from independent permanent magnetism in the iron, or
from fixing the horizontally induced magnetism.

   On the other hand, as regards 33 the case is different. It may be

caused not only by the subpermanent magnetism originally induced by the
horizontal force, and fixed in building, but by transient vertically induced
magnetism, and also by the subpermanent magnetism arising from fixing, in
the process of building, the transient vertically induced magnetism. Between

approximated to that of the line of no deviation in the ' Garry Owen,' which was about

N.W. by W. i W., and that in his subsequent works he did not revert to the subject ; and

that the hint here given was not pursued by subsequent investigators.

96 report--1862.

Cthese there is the great difference that the force which gives rise to and to

the first part of 33 ceases to operate, or at least ceases to operate in the same
direction, the moment the ship has been launched, and has her head directed

to different points of the compass, while the force causing the other part of 33
continues to act in its original direction as long as the ship remains in and
near its original geographical position.

   C, whatever its magnitude, may therefore be expected to diminish rapidly

after launching, and until the originally impressed magnetism reaches (as
it appears ultimately, and in fact after no long period, to do) the limit
beyond which sensible change does not proceed, and on a change of latitude
it will vary inversely as the horizontal force. 38, on the other hand, although

it may change considerably after launching, if the ship has been built north

or south, will, if the ship has been built east and west, remain unchanged.

On the other hand, on a change of magnetic latitude, while the effect of the

subpermanent magnetism induced by the horizontal force will vary inversely
as the horizontal force, that part which has been caused by the original ver-

tical magnetism may change more rapidly from the change in the inducing

cause, and the remaining part, or the transient vertically induced magnetism,
will in its effect vary as the tangent of the dip.

   The combination of these several causes renders the discovery of the true
source of the 33 a matter of great difficulty, even when observations have
been made in several different latitudes.

    That the distribution of the permanent magnetism of iron ships is
principally owing to tbeir position in building appears to have been first
strongly insisted on by Dr. Scoresby in the 4th Part of his magnetical
investigations published in 1852. The great importance of the service thus
rendered by Dr. Scoresby cannot be over-estimated. Dr. Scoresby also en-
deavoured to investigate the changes which the subpermanent magnetism of

a ship undergoes on a change of magnetic latitude. He did so, however, with

very insufficient materials, and it appears to us (as one of us has endeavoured
to point out with greater detail in the introduction to the 'Journal of a
Voyage of Magnetic Eesearch'), without having sufficient regard to the amount

of transient vertically induced magnetism which acts or may act as a cause

 of semicircular deviation.

    At the meeting of the British Association at Liverpool in 1854, Dr.
 Scoresby brought the subject of the change of a ship's magnetism promi-
 nently before the Association, in a paper on the loss of the ship 'Tayleur'
 and the changes of the compasses of iron ships. The discussion so occa-
 sioned gave rise to the formation of the Liverpool Compass Committee, whose
 valuable Eeports are one of the special subjects on which we are commis-
 sioned to report, and also to Dr. Scoresby's voyage in the ' Eoyal Charter
 for the purpose of observing the changes which take place in the magnetism
 of an iron ship on a change of magnetic latitude. To these we now address

 ourselves.

     The Liverpool Compass Committee have had the assistance throughout of a

 most able Secretary, Mr. W. W. Eundell, who has brought to the subject an

 amount of practical and scientific knowledge, combined with industry and
 zeal, which have given to the three Eeports which have been published the

 highest possible value.

     The first Eeport bears date the 5th of February, 1856, shortly before
 Dr. Scoresby sailed in the ' Eoyal Charter.' The second Eeport bears date
 February, 1857, and embodies the principal results of the observations in the
 * Eoyal Charter.' The third Eeport bears date the 13th of February, 1861.

ON THE THREE REPORTS OF THE LIVERPOOL COMPASS COMMITTEE. 97

     The first Report was merely preliminary, and stated the steps which the
 Committee were taking to obtain information. One of the few points on
 which the Committee had made observations, the details of which they give,
 was the direction of the neutral lines, or of those lines in the iron structure
 of the ship which separate the parts in which the iron attracts the north end
 of the compass-needle from those in which it attracts the south end. These
 observations, we may observe, though to a certain extent useful as enabling us

 to see generally the nature of the action of the body of the ship on the com-
 pass, do not give any very definite results, from the transient induced mag-
 netism being even more mixed up with the permanent or subpermanent
 magnetism than in the case of ships "swung."

     The Committee, in the first Report, draw the following inference from these
 observations, viz. that " the diverse direction of the magnetic lines appears
 to countenance Dr. Scoresby's supposition that they depend on the position of
 the ship when building."

  _ The second Report contains the results of much more extended observa-

--tions and matured views. On the point of most marked importance the

 connexion of the magnetism of an iron ship with her position when building

--the Committee had now arrived at a definite opinion. They say: "The

 records of the Committee no longer allow a doubt as to the connexion
 which exists between the direction of a ship's original magnetism and her

 position when upon the building-slip. In all the ships which have been

 examined, the north end of the compass-needle invariably deviated towards

 that part of the ship which was furthest from the north when she was build-
ing) if the compass was placed in a central position ami free from the influence

 of individual masses of iron." *

    The attention of the Committee was also directed to the changes which
the deviations undergo shortly after an iron ship has been launched, and they
came to the conclusion that the subpermanent magnetism undergoes consider-
able changes at and immediately after launching, and during the first voyage

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but that after this early reduction of a ship's magnetism has taken place, the
remaining portion appears to be comparatively permanent. This, however,

--is subject to the qualification mentioned in the Report, and which may be

stated as follows : that when a ship has been for a considerable time in one

position or on one course, the induced magnetic state acquires a certain degree
of permanence which modifies the previous subpermanent magnetism. The
general effect of this, it will be easily seen, is upon a change of course to

cause the vessel to deviate from her course, by dead reckoning, in the direction

of her previous course.

    In this Report attention is called to the very important subject of the

variation of the directive force in iron ships on different points of the com-

pass. With reference to this, it may be observed, that we think it is a result

of the observations generally, that the degree of correctness of observations of

force is much inferior to that of observations of deviation. The observations
of deviation give, by theory, the proportions of the directive forces on the

  We* have distinguished by italics the last part of this sentence in order to draw atten-

tion to one circumstance which continually forces itself into notice in the perusal of the
Reports, viz. the very little attention which is paid in the mercantile marine to the selec-

tion of a place for the compass. In these ships the compass is constantly placed so near
iron Bternposts, spindles of capstans, bulkheads, roundhouses, spindles of wheel, &c,
that the effect produced on the compass is not only extravagantly large, and the rapidity
of variation of the force in the field very great, but the effect produced is in truth not so

much that caused by the ship considered aa a whole, a.3 that caused by the particular

masses of iron in the vicinity of the compass.

different courses. Each, observation of force, therefore, when compared with

the proportionate force derived from the deviations, gives a value of the factor

(X,) by which the forces derived from the deviation ought to be multiplied.
· The second Report of the Liverpool Compass Committee also mentions

the interesting fact, which has been completely verified in the ships of the
Royal Xavy, that the quadrantal deviation of all ships is, with very rare and

special exceptions, positive, or such as to cause a deviation of the north end

of the compass to the north end of the ship and from the north side of the

ship. Such a deviation might be caused by an attraction to the north end or

Wea repidsion from the north side.  may distinguish between the two

causes by observing that the former would increase, and the latter diminish,

the mean directive force of the needle. Observations of the directive force,
therefore, show from which cause this deviation arises, and indicate that in
general in iron-built ships the quadrantal deviation is principally caused by
the repulsion of the north side of the ship, the north end of some ships attract-

ing the north point of the needle, of others repelling it, but in almost all

such ships with a force inferior to that of the repulsion of the north side.

In wood-built ships the case is different : there is no transverse horizontal
iron to cause repulsion from the sides ; and the positive quadrantal deviation
is caused by the attraction of the masses of iron before and abaft the compass.

The exceptions are generally in the case of wooden screw-streamers, when the

screw-shaft, passing through the place of the compass, causes a repulsion

from the north end, or in the case of elevated compasses, in which the original

+ D has depended on an excess of repulsion of the sides over the repulsion of

the ends. As the compass is elevated, the direction of the former force, be-
coming more oblique, loses its effect much more rapidly than the latter, and

Dthe consequently changes its sign.

The Committee also observed on the heeling error, and on the general

tendency being to draw the north end to the weather side, but stated that the

evidence which they had obtained did not enable them to draw any definite

conclusions on this subject.

   The third Report embodies the results of very extended and varied obser-

vations, leading to very definite conclusions, which may nearly to the full
extent be accepted as being now established.

   As we have already observed, the present state of the mathematical theory

is such, and the mathematical results coincide so exactly with observations,

that the details of observation lose much of their interest, and the results

involved in the coefficients extracted by rule from the observations are suf-

ficient for all practical as well as theoretical purposes.

   The Report commences with a summary of the points which the Committee

consider as established ; they are

         1. That the magneasm of iron ships is distributed according to precise

       and well-determined laws.
           2. That a definite magnetic character is impressed on every iron ship

       while on the building-slip, which is never afterwards entirely lost.
           3. That a considerable reduction takes place in the magnetism of an

       iron ship on first changing her position after launching, but afterwards
       that any permanent change in its direction or amount is a slow and
        gradual process.

           4. That the original magnetism of an iron ship is constantly subject

      to small fluctuations from change of position arising from new magnetic

         inductions.
ON THE THREE REPORTS OF THE LIVERPOOL COMPASS COMMITTEE. 99

   5. That the compass-errors occasioned hy the more permanent part

of a ship's magnetism may be successfully compensated, and that this

compensation equalizes the directive po-wer of the compass-needle on the

several courses on which a ship may be placed.

   The first two points we have already adverted to, and we fully agree
with the Committee in considering that they may now be accepted as well

established.

The third point is one of the most important of the results to which the

making, registering, and discussing the observations of deviation in iron

ships is at present leading us.

It is clear that when an iron ship is first launched, her magnetic cha-

racter depends almost entirely on her position in building, but that this

magnetic state is extremely unstable ; that very great changes take place

within a few days, or even hours, after launching ; but that, after no long

time (the length of time depending no doubt, to a great extent, on the ser j

vice in which the vessel has been employed), what may be called the tem-

porary magnetism gets " shaken out " of her, and the magnetism of the ship

acquires an extremely stable character. This is a matter on which exact and

varied observations are much wanted; but we think it may be taken at

present as the most probable result, that after about twelve months there is

very little change in the magnetism of a ship which has made some voyages

in the interval. In some ships the stability is most striking. It must, how-

ever, be remembered that it does not folio iv from this that the whole of the

magnetism which remains, and which affects the compass, is the permanent

magnetism of hard iron. There is in all iron ships, as shown by the amount

of the quadrantal deviation, a large quantity of soft iron, and consequently a

large quantity of magnetism developed instantaneously (or nearly so) by

induction ; and the magnetism developed in the soft iron by vertical induc-

tion is not, in any given geographical position, distinguishable from the per-

manent magnetism of hard iron. The test of the kind of permanence which

is acquired by the magnetism of an iron ship after the lapse of the period we

had referred to is, that her table of deviation shall always be the same when

swung at the same geographical position. If, in addition to this, her semi-

circular deviation in different parts of the globe is inversely proportional to

the horizontal force of magnetism at the place, we infer that the vertically

induced magnetism is so distributed as to produce a compensation of effects,

and that the only cause which operates is the permanent magnetism of the

hard iron. In some ships this appears to be the case. In H. M. S. ' Trident,'
which has been particularly discussed by Mr. Airy, the magnetism is not only

extremely stable, but nearly the whole of the semicircular deviation appears,

from observations made in various latitudes, to be due to hard iron. The
same is the case with H. M. S. 'Adventure ' and with many other iron ships.

   The practical conclusion which, it appears to us, may be drawn from

these facts, is the importance in all iron ships of having their magnetic history

Wecarefully recorded, and the observations discussed.  need hardly say that,

to give any value to such a record, observations should be made with the

compass in a fixed position in the ship, and not corrected in any way by

magnets or soft iron.

   On the fourth point we have, in fact, already expressed our opinion. "We

are not satisfied that the effects here referred to are in general of appreciable

amount in so short a space of time as that occupied by the process of swinging

a ship. There seems, however, no doubt that the cause operates sensibly in

                                                                         h2

100 REPORT 1862.

many cases when a ship has been long sailing in one direction ; and this re-
mark might be taken as a qualification of what we have remarked as to the

permanence of the magnetism of a ship.

   On the fifth point we quite agree with the Liverpool Compass Com-

mittee, subject, however, to the qualification that this correction cannot be

depended on in the case of a newly-built ship, and that when the correction

is applied to compasses having large deviations, and placed near large vertical

masses of iron, as a stern-post, there must always be great uncertainty as to

the correction on a change of magnetic latitude. It is also right that we

should not pass over this remark without protesting against the application
of such correction to the standard compass (properly placed) of a ship which

may be called on to make a voyage during which there is any great change in

the dip or horizontal force.

   The Committee notice as the principal points left for further discussion
and inquiry, the effect of heeling on the compasses of iron ships, and the
changes which occur on a change of magnetic latitude ; and to these the

Eeport is chiefly directed.

   On the effect of heeling a considerable body of evidence is collected,

but with the disadvantage that at that time the mathematical theory of the
heeling error, and the formula? which express it, had not been fully investi-
gated, and that consequently the comparison of theory with observation could

not be precisely made ; nor do the observations in all cases furnish sufficient

data for the comparison.

  We think, however, that it may be said, with confidence, that the results

of observations agree with theory as to the connexion between the amount

and direction of the heeling error and the coefficients of quadrantal deviation

and of horizontal and vertical force j and that we may therefore feel assured
that the heeling error may be predicted with sufficient accuracy from obser-

vations made on an even keel.

The most important practical results as to the amount of the heeling

error, are the very great amount to which it reaches in certain ships, and in
eertain positions in the ship. This heeling error is conveniently measured
by the fraction of a degree or the number of degrees of error produced by

every degree of heel when the ship's head is North or South. Estimating it

in this way, it will be seen that the error may have serious effects if it exceed

·5 or -6, when an inclination of 10° may produce half a point of error.

Among the examples given we have

    In other compasses of the ' Slieve Donard ' the heeling error was almost
imperceptible. In the case of the ' City of Baltimore,' the large heeling error
is evidently due to the vertical force downwards near the stern, arising from
the ship having been built head north. In the ' Slieve Donard,' the small
heeling error is evidently due to the ship having been built with her head to

the southward.

Before leaving the subject of the third Beport, we must beg leave to

mention one point which has made the duty of reviewing the Beport more

difficult than it would otherwise have been, and which we fear will detract

from its general utility, viz. that the mathematical formulae made use of in

reducing the observations are nowhere given, and that we have been unable,

Wein some cases, to verify or use them.  hope that the Admiralty Manual

may be of some use to future investigators, as providing a uniform notation

and mode of reduction, which will make the results derived by one investi-

gator intelligible to all.

   In concluding this notice, we think we may say that the principal deside-

rata at present are

1. That in the construction of iron vessels, regard should be had to the

providing a proper place for the compass. It is not difficult for any one who

has studied the question to point out arrangements which would greatly

mitigate the injurious effects of the iron of the ship ; the difficulty is to recon-

cile them with the requirements of construction and of working the vessel.

2. That for throwing light on the points which are still obscure, what is

chiefly required is, that the complete magnetic history of some iron vessels in

various latitudes should be known. This, we think, might easily be accom-

plished by observations of deviations and horizontal and vertical force made

at various fixed positions in an iron vessel in an extended voyage in both
Wehemispheres.
                need hardly add, that this should be a vessel of war of

moderate size, and in which the magnetical observations would be made an

object of importance.

Report on Tidal Observations on the Humber. Presented by James Old-
   ham, C.E. ; John Scott Russell, C.E., F.R.S. ; J. F. Bateman,
   C.E., F.R.S. ; and Thomas Thompson.

At the Meeting of the British Association held at Manchester last year

a paper was read in Section G, on the Port of Hull, in which occurred the
.102  report--1862.

following remark, referring to the tides of the Humber : " I would notice here

a -singular tidal phenomenon which exists at the Port of Hull ; I refer to the
fact, that whenever the tide reaches the 16-feet mark " (over the dock-sill),
" it is then three hours to high water, whether they be spring tides or neap

tides. I am not aware that the same thing occurs at any other port ; but such

is the fact at Hull, that three hours after the tide has attained to the 16-feet
mark, there is no more rise."

    These remarks gave rise to an animated discussion on the alleged pheno-
menon, and resulted in the appointment of the following members of the
Association as a Committee to conduct a series of tidal observations on the

Humber, and report on the same to the next Meeting to be holden at Cam-
bridge, viz. Mr. James Oldham, C.E., Mr. John Scott Eussell, C.E., F.R.S.,
Mr. J. F. Bateman, C.E., F.R.S., and Mr. Thomas Thompson, with £25 at their

disposal.

   In commencing the arrangements for carrying out the wishes of the Asso-
ciation, application was made to the directors of the Manchester, Sheffield,
and Lincolnshire Railway Company for a month's observations to be taken at
their self-acting tide-gauge at the Great Grimsby Docks, but it was not con-
venient to the directors to grant the request; they, however, permitted a

gauge-pole to be fixed at their landing-pier at New Holland, oh the Lincoln-

shire coast of the Humber, a little above Hull, and gave every facility in the

progress of the operation of observing the tides.

   The Hull Dock Company, through their secretary, Mr. W. H. Huffam, have

complied with a request to have a month's observations from their self-
acting gauge of the Victoria Docks ; and the resident engineer of the com-
pany, Mr. R. A. Marrillier, has furnished the month's valuable tidal obser-

vations.

. Mr. Thomas "Wilson, of Leeds, an active member of the British Associa-

tion, kindly offered a month's observations from the self-acting tide-gauge of
the docks of the Air and Calder Works, at the Port of Goole, on the river

Ouse, which have also been furnished by Mr. W. H. Bartholomew, the resident

engineer.

   Those on the Humber were commenced at or about 11 a.m., July 9th,

and terminated at 3 p.m., August 6th ; but those at Goole, which were begun
at 11 a.m. on the 9th July, were continued until twelve o'clock at noon on the
10th of August.

   The gauge at New Holland is so fixed as to correspond with, and is on

the same level as, the Victoria Dock gauge at Hull, i. e. the zeros are made

 to coincide.

   The observations were taken every five minutes at New Holland, but every

fifteen minutes at the Hull Dock gauge ; the observations at Goole were taken

 at intervals of five minutes.

 .. As a result of these tidal investigations it was seen, by the series of obser-
vations at both the stations on the Humber, how accurately the statement is
borne out as to rise of tides for three hours after attaining the 16-feet mark,
and also that the time which the tide is falling from the period of high water
to the same level again of 16 feet is also found to average about three hours.

    The observations are also important and valuable, as showing the general
fate of the rising and falling of the tides at the various periods and places

 reported on.

    Although little or no light may have been thrown on the phenomenon in
question, yet the various tidal observations obtained on the Humber and the

river Ouse will no doubt prove valuable records on the question of tides.

  --From the various observations the following are the results : The obser-

vations made on the Humber comprised 55 tides : the greatest variation at
spring tides was 22 feet 3 inches flow ; and the least variation at neap tides
a rise only of 10 feet 7 inches. The lowest level of low water at spring tides
was 3 feet 8 inches, and the highest rise 27 feet 11 inches; the highest at
low water of neap tides 11 feet 2 inches. The mean rise of the 55 tides above
low water was found to be 16' 95 feet. The average time of rising tide is

about 5^ hours, and the falling tide about 6| hours.
   At the season of the year when the observations were taken it is generally

calm, and there is no undue influence exerted on the rise and fall of the tides

on the Humber ; but at the time of the equinox, and in stormy winter seasons,
particularly during north-westerly gales, there is a much greater rise and fall

during spring tides than would otherwise occur.
    The observations made at Goole (which port is about 30 miles above Hull)

--show on the 63 tides a mean rise of 11-67 feet, the greatest rise above low

water being 15 feet 4 inches, and the least rise from low-water line 7 feet
7 inches.

    The tides at Goole average about 3 hours in rising, and a little over 9 hours

in falling.

   The mean rate of the tidal wave on the Humber is from 2| to 3 miles at

neap tides, and 4 to 5 miles per hour at spring tides.

On Rifled Guns and Projectiles adapted for Attacking Armour-plate
            Defences. By T. Aston, M.A., Barrister at Law.

                    [A communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

As it is now an admitted fact that naval warfare will be carried on by iron-

clad navies, it has become an imperative necessity that the navy of England

shall henceforth be armed with artillery adapted for attacking the new

armour-plate defences which all nations are hastening to adopt. The supe-
riority which defence so suddenly acquired over attack, by simply putting
on a coat of armour, threatened to upset not only the theoretical but the

practical tactics of modem warfare. The necessity of improving the means

of attack so as to restore, as far as possible, the disturbed equilibrium was
obvious to every one ; and the contest which has been carried on in this
country for the last two or three years between the attack of improved artil-
lery and the defence of improved armour-plates has been watched by all of
us with the greatest interest. From a scientific point of view, with which
we are on this occasion more immediately concerned, the subject was one

--Which engaged the attention of some of the keenest and most experienced

intellects of the country, these, on the one hand, giving practical aid on the
side of defence, those, on the other, devoting their best energies to restore

-- --attack to what must be considered its normal position of superiority. For a

long time for too long a time the defence-people had much the best of it.
Under the energetic superintendence of the Plate Committee (who in this
matter de republica bene meriti sunt), armour-plate targets were erected by

our able engineers which at fighting-ranges laughed to scorn the utmost
efforts of the artillery attack brought against them. Some of the targets
combined the resistance of iron with wood ; others, constructed with far-seeing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            :

ingenuity, depended upon iron alone. The Ordnance Select Committee were
challenged to bring forward the best gun their artillery science, aided by all
the resources of the Koyal arsenals and the public purse, was able to provide.
The science brought to bear by the Ordnance Select Committee, after exhausting
itself in repeated efforts to cover its repeated defeats (efforts that were fruit-
less for reasons that will be explained), was at length compelled to confess
itself vanquished. But Ordnance had other resources which it hoped to have
dispensed with, and upon which in its disappointment it was glad to fall back
it said to the Committee of Defence, " If yoa will obligingly set up your
armour-targets within a shortened range (say, for instance, a Robin Hood
bowshot of 200 yards), you shall see what the brute force of the old smooth-
bore will do. True it is that cast iron will be brought to attack wrought

--iron that a rounded missile will have to punch its way through a flat and
--possibly at times inclined armour-plate science, which proved but a broken

reed iu our hands, must be abandoned ; but with a gun big enough, a shot
heavy enough, a charge of powder large enough, and a range short enough,
the smooth-bore shall smash your target." Of course it would ; and so would
a battering-ram like those Titus used to break the gates of Jerusalem. If
therefore the old smooth-bore had failed the Ordnance Committee, like the
service rifled gun, they might have fallen back on the older battering-ram.

    Looking at it from a scientific point of view, this retrogression was very
humiliating, and it caused the country serious anxiety to hear Her Majesty's
Ministers state in Parliament, as they did in the last session, on the authority,
of course, of their official scientific advisers, that the Navy of England, after
all the vast expenditure that had been lavished upon it, was at last obliged to
be armed with the old smooth-bores to meet the iron-clad navies of her pos-
sible enemies. This was indeed proclaiming England's weakness to other
nations who were more scientifically informed and better anred than she.

    In further explanation of what was the actual condition in which this all-

important question stood no later than May last, I will quote the statement

of Sir William Armstrong, who, at a meeting of the United Service Institu-

--tion, May 20, 1862, expressed himself in these words: '· It certainly may be

said that shells are of no avail against iron-plated ships ; but, on the cher
hand, I may say that neither 68-pounders nor 110-pounder guns with solid
round shot are effective against such iron vessels. The fact is, what we want

is a gun, in addition to our 110-pounder rifled gun, especially adapted for

breaking through iron plates. That is what we are in want of now." This
statement made in 1862 was very startling to all of us, who knew that long ago

Prance armed her 'Gloires' and ' Kormandies' with rifled 90-pounders said
 to be efficient against iron plates. Such being the state of the question a few

months back, we may proceed to consider, first, the reason why the artillery

 hitherto employed in the service, including rifled guns and smooth-bores, has
 always failed to make any impression on the plated defences at ordinary
 fighting-range ; and secondly, by what means artillery sciei ce has lately re-

 conquered its lost ground. Sir William Armstrong put the case very plainly

 when he said that shells were in fact of no avail againc t plated ships, and that
 the solid shot of the 110-pounder rifled gun was not effective against srch
 iron vessels. But late experiments at Shoebiuyness, in which the 'Warrior'

 target was pierced and shattered at 600 yards, have proved that the case as
 put by Sir William Armstrong was based on his experience of shells that
 were not made of the proper form, nor of the proper material, and on his ex-

 perience of rifled guns that were unable to propel their projectiles with the

 requisite velocity.
         ON RIFLED GUNS FOR ATTACKING ARMOUR-PLATE DEFENCES. 105

   Three conditions may be laid down as necessary to enable artillery to

attack successfully armour-plate defences : 1st, the projectile must be of the
proper form ; 2nd, of the proper material ; and 3rd, be propelled from a gun
able to give it the necessary velocity. The artillery of the Ordnance Select
Committee failed because they utterly neglected the first two conditions, and
had recourse to the brute force of the smooth-bore for the third. The ex-
pression accepted as representing the penetrating power of shot was " velo-
city squared, multiplied by weight;" but the form of the shot and the mate-
rial were conditions altogether omitted from the expression ; and the import-

ance of the omission will be obvious at once if we take an analogous case, say
that of a punching-machine employed to perforate wrought-iron plates. What
would be the result if the punch itself, which is made of suitable shape and

material, were removed, and a round-headed poker, of brittle cast iron or soft

--wrought iron, were substituted in its place ? The great importance of suf-

ficient velocity is conceded it is a sine-qud-non condition; but has there not
been great misconception in supposing that the old smooth-bore gives a

greater initial velocity than the rifled gun? The results obtained will show

how this is. The average initial velocity of the 68-pounder is, in round num-

bers, 1600 feet per second with a charge of powder one-fourth the weight of
the shot, the length of the shot being of course one calibre. Sir William
Armstrong stated that with a charge of powder one-fourth the weight of the
shot, he obtained with his rifled gun an initial velocity of 1740 feet per second:
he did not state the length of his projectile. Mr. Whitworth, with a projec-
tile one and a half calibre long, obtains an initial velocity of 1900 feet per
second ; and with a projectile one calibre long, like that of the smooth-bore, an
initial velocity of 2200 feet per second, being greater than that of the smooth-
bore in the proportion of 22 to 10. The reason why, under nearly similar con-
ditions as to charge and length of projectile, the rifled gun had an initial velocity
60 greatly superior to that of the smooth must be ascribed to the action of the
first condition I ventured to lay down as necessary. The rifled projectile, as
compared with the spherical, has a form which is better adapted for flight,
and fits more accurately the bore of the gun, so that the gases of explosion
exert a greater pressure upon it while propelling it through the barrel. In
practice the initial velocity of the rifled projectile is lower than that of the
smooth-bore, because with the rifled gun the charge of powder used is much
less, while the projectile is much longer and heavier, and has a greater vis
inertias to be overcome at starting than that of the smooth-bore. If very
large charges be used with the rifled guns, and long projectiles, with the view
of obtaining increased velocity, the strain becomes too great for the guns
to bear ; but if rifled guns arc fired with charges so low that they are not
made to perform half the work they ought to do, then, though the defects of

weak construction may not be made patent by the gun being destroyed, they
are very plainly manifested by the weak results of their projectiles fired

against armour-plates. It is proved by well-known results that the con-
structors of the 110-pounder rifled gun, now adopted in the service, do not
dare to make the gun perform its full work ; but, on the contrary, they find
themselves forced gradually to reduce their charges, until they are well beaten
by the old smooth-bore they undertook to supersede. The only conclusion
that can be drawn from this fact is, that the gun is weak in construction,
and the projectile used with it is defective in principle.

   The power of the smooth-bore, with its large windage, to fire large charges,
and thereby obtain great velocities, has procured it many advocates ; but Mr.
Whitworth 's experiments have shown that if length of projectile be given up,
106 REPORT 1862.

which may be looked upon as the price to be paid for increased velocity,
he can get an initial velocity much greater than that of the smooth-bore.

But is the result worth the price paid ? Not if a more efficient compromise
can be obtained. I use the word " compromise " advisedly, because I think
that every one who has had experience in artillery practice will agree with

me that the best results are only to be obtained by means of the best com-
promise. You cannot have long projectiles and very high velocities without
burning too much powder and taking too much out of your gun, or else

making it an unwieldy monster.

   The problem we have placed before us now is, How can artillery be best

--adapted for attacking armour-defences ? The advocates of the smooth-bore are

satisfied with one condition high velocity. Mr. Whitworth objects, and says,
" If velocity were all that is needed, I can get more than you do in the pro-
portion of 22 to 16 ; but to sacrifice all to velocity is a bad compromise to
effect a solution of the penetration-problem. You set down velocity as c/reatest
possible, form of projectile of no account, material of no account, and after
all can do nothing at an ordinary fighting-range while you wrongly take it as
proved that 'shells are of no avail' against iron-plated ships. It would be
a far better compromise to be satisfied with a lower velocity, getting however

--all you can at a fair price, and combining therewith conditions one and two

proper form and proper material for the projectile." Let us now compare
the actual results obtained in the way of penetration by the Armstrong 110-

pounder (the proposed naval gun), the old 68-pounder smooth-bore, and the
two naval "Whitworth guns lately fired at Shoeburyness.

cavity is formed in the projectile of the size required to contain the hursting
charge of ordinary powder. The rear is closed entirely by a screwed plate
or cap. The uncertain complications of percussion-fuses, and also the sim-

pler time-fuses, are wholly dispensed with. No fuse or detonating substance
of any kind is used. On firing his shell through iron plates, Mr. "Whitworth

found that by the force of impact and friction sufficient heat was generated
to fire the bursting charge without any fuse at all. In practice the action
upon the powder was found to be even too rapid. To retard its action for
the time necessary to enable the shell to effect a complete penetration and
then to burst, Mr. Whitworth interposes between the metal of his shell and
his bursting powder-charge a substance that is a non-conductor of heat: by
preference he encloses the powder in a flannel case, and finds that by simply
diminishing or increasing the thickness of his flannel he can burst his shell
in the armour-plate or in the timber-backing, or after it has passed through

both. The fragments of the shell now before the Section are those of one

which was fired through this armour-plate, and which burst and shattered
this backing of timber, 9 inches thick, placed behind the plate. There is one
point in connexion with the Shoeburyness trials which should be specially
noticed, and it is this, that all the previous experiments against the ' "Warrior
target had been confined to the short range of 200 yards ; at longer distances
the smashing, monster smooth-bores cannot be made to hit the mark ; whereas
Mr. "Whitworth has proved that at a good fighting-range of GOO yards he can

--hit his mark to a few inches, and can at that distance and there is good reason

--to believe at twice that distance send his shells through the ' Warrior's ' sides.

That 600 yards may be fairly called a good fighting-range will be admitted
when we remember that the 'Agamemnon,' at Sebastopol, fought all the guns

--of Fort Constantine at a range of 500 yards ; and the ' Albion ' signalled,

" Well done, Agamemnon! where you lead, we will follow." With respect
to the 120-pounder gun itself, it should be explained that it was made at

Woolwich, under the able superintendence of Mr. Anderson, at Mr. "Whit-

worth's own request, and according to drawings originally supplied by him. It
has the same bore as the Armstrong 110-pounder, stated by Sir "William not

to be effective against iron-plated ships. It is a built-up gun, and its hoops
are made of coiled iron, welded ; but that method of manufacture was adopted
by Mr. Whitworth in the first built-up gun that he made, and was well

known in this country many years before rifled guns were introduced into

the service.

    Mr. Whitworth has himself employed by preference the homogeneous
metal, which he has found to answer perfectly for small arms and field guns,
as well as for the penetration-shells which have been described. Practical
improvements have been made in the process of forging and annealing the

metal, which now enable it to be worked in masses of any required size,
whose quality may be henceforth depended upon with certainty.

   "Whitworth heavy guns are now being made with both interior tubes and

outer of homogeneous metal of the improved manufacture, so that the guns
will be constructed throughout of one uniform metal without any welding at
all. Experience justifies the expectation that they will be free from the

objections which it is well known are inherent in all welded guns, and be
fully able to resist the severe and searching strain which is sure, sooner or
later, to disable a gun built up of forged coiled tubes, if it be called upon to
do its full work by discharging heavy rifled projectiles at the most efficient

velocities.
ON THE OBSERVATORY AT KEW.  109

Extracts, relating to the Observatory at Kew, from a Report presented
   to the Portuguese Government by Dr. Jacintho Antonio de Souza,

    Professor of the Faculty of Philosophy in the University of Coimbra.
    Communicated by J. P. Gassiot, F.R.S.

                                [Ordered to be printed among the Beports.]

Dr. Jacintho Antonio be Souza has published an account of a visit in 1860
to the Scientific Establishments of Madrid, Paris, Brussels, Greenwich, and
Kew, and of a second visit in 1861 to the Observatory of Kew, both visits
having been made by the desire of his Government, and having for their

principal object to obtain information preparatory to the establishment of a
Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory at the University of Coimbra.

   His first visit was to Madrid, where he states that he found nothing doing
in magnetism ; and that in meteorology the only instrument presenting any
novelty was the ingenious and comprehensive meteorograph of Padre Secchi,
intended to register atmospheric pressure, the amount of rain, and the direc-
tion and velocity of the wind. Prof, de Souza commends this instrument for
the small space which it occupies, but adds that some of its indications,
particularly those of temperature, appeared to him to be subject to much

uncertainty. He was disposed to attribute the absence of any magnetical

investigations at Madrid rather to the indifference of the Government than

to any want of zeal on the part of the distinguished Director, Don Antonio

Aguilar, of whose kind reception he also speaks gratefully.

   He next proceeded to Paris, where he arrived on the 15th of August, " the

birthday of the first Napoleon," and was dazzled with the splendour of all

that met his eyes in the general aspect of that brilliant capital. He had

looked forward to finding in "the Imperial Observatory directed by Le Yerrier,"
besides a " typical Astronomical Observatory," one of the best in " magnetism
and meteorology, where there would be much to see and to study ; " but after
obtaining access to that fine establishment, " not without difficulty and loss
of precious time," he derived, as he states, " little interest and profit from
the hasty view which M. Le Yerrier afforded him of the Astronomical Ob-

servatory (which is indeed excellent)," whilst, in regard to the special objects

of his journey, though MM. Desains and Charault courteously showed him

whatever could be said to ajraertain to magnetism or meteorology, he states
that he " came away disappointed."

   At Brussels he refers gratefully to the frank and delicate kindness with
which, on presenting himself at the Observatory, he was received by M.
Quetelet, and expresses his admiration of what that philosopher had accom-
plished with means from which very few others could have educed similar
results, and of the impulse imparted by him to the advancement of the
"physique du globe," saying at the same time that, without this knowledge,
the inspection of the magnetical and meteorological portion of the Observatory-
would lead a visitor to regard it as not being at the present time in a state

of prosperity.

   Approaching London by the Thames, and entering " the vast cupola of
smoke which covers that great capital," he seems to have been powerfully
impressed by the dissimilarity to what he had previously seen in France and
Belgium; and by the grandeur as well as the sombre character of the

spectacle presented to his view.

   On arriving at Greenwich he was courteously received at the Royal Obser-

vatory, admired the general arrangements of that great establishment, and
inspected minutely the magnetical and meteorological portion, with the

" advantage of verbal explanations by the Eev. Robert Main, who was there

at the moment, besides the written explanations kindly given to him by

Mr. Airy." He thus became well acquainted with the localities, arrange-

ments, and instruments, of which he gives a detailed description ; but as he

ultimately preferred ordering for his own Observatory instruments on the
pattern of those employed at Kew, we may pass at once to his account of that

establishment, which will be given nearly in his own words :

" The Observatory at Kew, besides occupying itself with meteorological

and magnetical phenomena, and the photographic registry of the spots of the

sun, verifies meteorological and magnetical instruments, compares them with

the excellent patterns which it possesses, determines their constants, and

improves the methods of observation. The Director (Mr. Balfour Stewart) was

absent ; but Mr. Chambers, assistant observer, and Mr. Beckley, mechanical

engineer of the Observatory, attended me so obligingly, and with such sincere

mydesire to satisfy all  importunate inquiries, that I derived great profit from

the visit.

   " The self-registering magnetic instruments at Kew were constructed in

1857, about ten years after the registering apparatus at Greenwich was

adapted to the previously existing instruments at that Observatory. Based

on the same general principles, they differ in size, and in certain happy

innovations introduced by Mr. Welsh and executed by Adie (a skilful artist

in London). They have been in action since 185S, and give results which

leave nothing to be desired.

   " The locality in which the self-registering magnetic instruments are placed

at Kew is in the basement-story of the building, which was formerly an

astronomical observatory : the choice was determined by a condition which

should never be lost sight of, viz. the greatest attainable constancy of tem-

perature."

   [Having already described the magnetographs at Greenwich, Prof, de Souza,

whilst giving a very elaborate description of the Kew instruments, dwells at

length principally on the points in which they differ from those at Greenwich

but the description is here omitted, as the Kew instruments have been care-

fully and well described by Mr. Balfour Stewart in the volume of Reports of

the Aberdeen Meeting of the British Association, p. 200-228. Prof, de Souza

--proceeds as follows :

  A" short time before my visit to the Observatory Dr. Bergsma had been

there, sent by the Dutch Government to examine the magnetographs

destined for an observatory in Java, and constructed on the Kew pattern.

I may say in passing that this examination consists in receiving practical

instruction on the mode of manipulating with the instruments, in assisting

in their collocation in the verification-house, and in the determination of

constants. Some modifications were introduced in Dr. Bergsma's magneto-

graphs which I will now notice, and which constitute their last state of

improvement.

" The great bell-glasses which rest on the marble disks were replaced by

cylinders of gun-metal surmounted by smaller glass cylinders. Each has an

aperture to which is adapted a plate of glass with parallel faces, taking the

place which in the great bell-glasses was occupied by the openings of the

glass plate and of the achromatic lens ; by this new arrangement the achro-

matic lens is independent of the cylinder, and can be brought near to, or

removed further from, the mirror according to convenience. In this manner

any disarrangement of the cylindrical glasses, or the taking of them away,

does not alter the position of the lens, or interrupt the march of the magneto-

graphs. These different pieces fit so as to enclose the magnet hermetically,

and thus the air can be rarefied or withdrawn by means of an air-pump in

communication with a tube which passes through the marble disk and opens

into the enclosure. This exhaustion of the air prevents the influence upon

the magnets of currents of air.

   "Three telescopes, directed to the mirrors of the magnetographs, are

established on two stone pillars, and have each an ivory scale the divisions of
which are reflected, by the moveable and by the fixed mirror, into the interior

of the telescope, offering in the field of view two very distinct images of the

scale, one of which moves with the mirror of the magnet, so that at different

times different divisions of this scale will appear to coincide with the vertical

wire of the telescope. By the comparison of these divisions with that of the
image which is fixed, the position of the magnet at any moment may be
known ; so that, besides the continuous photographic record going on out of
sight, and only taken account of every other day, there may be obtained, on

any occasion, direct observations, which is a consideration of great importance.
For example, if there is a magnetic disturbance, not only can it be observed

at the instant of its occurrence, but also direct observations may be obtained

of oscillations which by their amplitude exceed the limits of the photographic

paper.

    " In describing the magnetographs at Greenwich two scales were mentioned,
one elastic, the other of paper, with which the times corresponding to the
different points of the base-line were obtained, and the values of the ordinates

of the curves calculated. These scales at Kew are metallic, and make part

of an apparatus very simple and ingenious, which, being subject to a graduated
movement, is both easy and exact in operation. It is, however, not easily
described without the assistance of a figure.

   "For absolute determinations and secular changes there is a detached
building of wood (copper-fastened) at a distance from the Observatoiy, where
there are three wooden pillars solidly fixed in the ground, one for the instru-

ments with which the coefficients of temperature and of induction of the
magnetic bars are determined, and two for the inclinometer of Barrow and
the unifilar of Gibson. These two instruments and a good chronometer

constitute the necessary furniture of this building."

    After a very careful and detailed description of the inclinometer and
unifilar, Prof, de Souza proceeds, in his account of his first visit to Kew, as

follows :

    " In the verification-house, sixty yards from the observatory, Mr. Beckley
was setting up for trial for the first time the registering electrometer of Pro-

fessor Thomson of Glasgow. This new invention, which seems destined to

supply a great desideratum in meteorology, would have been one of the objects
of the greatest interest to me, if I could have seen it in action and have
appreciated some of its results. Dispersed as were its different parts, I could

not well make to myself a clear idea of the who1^. The following is what I

gathered from the explanations of Mr. Beckley.

    "Professor Thomson's electrometer has for its object the photographic

the same metal is insulated from the earth, and is in communication with
the external air by means of the water of a reservoir, which is thrown into

the air in a constant jet. From the top of the discontinuous circle formed
by these semicircles, and in the direction of the space which they leave

between them, there is suspended a metallic needle insulated from the whole

of the apparatus, but in communication with a Leyden jar, to which is given

a constant charge measured by the angle of torsion made by another needle

suspended to the thread of another apparatus. With the first needle there

moves a small mirror, on which falls the light of a lamp reflecting upon the

registering cylinder where the electric curve is produced upon sensitive paper.

Another fascicle of light which comes from the fixed mirror gives the base-

line. One of the semicircles being in the state of the earth's, and the other

in that of the atmosphere's electric tension, and the needle which moves at

the top of the space which separates them having a known and constant

electricity, it is clear that the slightest alteration in the difference between

the tensions, or in the quality of the electricity by which they are produced,

will be directly indicated by the movement of the needle which impresses

itself immediately on the photographic paper. If this instrument receives at

Kew the attention of which inventions conducing to the advancement of

science are there thought worthy, and if any imperfections which may be

discovered in it in practice are successfully removed, Professor Thomson will

have the honour of having discovered the most sensitive and instantaneous

electrometer in existence, which will doubtless smooth the great difficulties

which impede the advance of the science of atmospheric electricity. In the

presence of this electrometer the electric apparatus employed at Greenwich

will fall into disuse, as it has already done at Kew, where it is dismantled.

Of the other meteorological instruments in the Kew Observatory, I will only

mention the great standard barometer, or rather the process by means of

which its large tube is filled. The barometer and a cathetometer, with

which are observed the differences of level of the indices of the mercury in

the cistern and in the column, are fixed to a wall which formerly supported

the mural gradient of the Astronomical Observatory. It is essentially the

barometer of Eegnault ; but it can turn around its axis, which is adjusted in

the vertical position by means of screws of pressure : the indices move until

they touch the surface of the mercury of the cistern ; one terminates in an

edge, the other in a cone : the diameter of the tube is 1*1 inch."

Prof, de Sauza here describes in considerable detail the process of making

and filling such a barometer-tube. [For this process the English reader is

referred to Mr. Welsh's original paper in the Philosophical Transactions for

1856,  Art.  XXIII.
                                 ]

Before returning to London, Prof, de Souza visited the Gardens at Kew,

and takes occasion to express his very great admiration of the gardens, the

palm-house, and especially of the museum. He then proceeds as follows :

   " In London I addressed myself to Major-General Sabine. I have great

satisfaction in declaring thus publicly, that the relations acquired with this

courteous gentleman so long engaged in magnetical science, constitute one of

the most valuable acquisitions which I made in England. It is known that

General Sabine has devoted himself for almost half a century, with an ardour

and activity never interrupted, to the study of terrestrial magnetism. From
1818 to 1822 he made four successive long scientific voyages ; in 1837 he
published the first general map of the isodynamic lines of the globe ; after-

wards he brought about the establishment of four observatories very differ-
ently circumstanced in regard to the intensity of the terrestrial magnetic

--force, and in opposite positions in regard to the magnetical and geographical

poles and equators ?'. e. the observatories of Toronto, Hobarton, Cape of

Good Hope, and St. Helena. He has also superintended these establishments,

and reduced and analysed their observations, from whence have resulted
       ON THE OBSERVATORY AT KEW.               113

numerous and important publications. He continues himself to observe

during a portion of the year, and has almost completed a map of the different

magnetic elements over England.

   " As was to be hoped, General Sabine heard with lively interest that tbe
establishment of a magnetical and meteorological observatory at Coimbra was
in contemplation, and readily offered to help forward the realization of this
good idea by directing the construction of the magnetic and other instruments
required, and also undertook that they should be verified and their constants

obtained at the Kew Observatory, where I should be enabled to make

practical studies, and receive suitable instruction for their establishment and

manipulation,

   "General Sabine, speaking of the University of Coimbra in terms very
agreeable to a Portuguese auditor, expressed satisfaction at so good an oppor-
tunity of sending to this respectable Academy eleven large volumes of obser-
vations analysed by him and published, under his superintendence, by the
English Government. Besides the observations of the four observatories

above mentioned, there are also contained in these volumes observations from
Lake Athabasca, Fort Simpson, Fort Carlton, Fort Confidence, the Falkland
Islands, and Pekin.

   " I informed the Faculty at their first meeting after my arrival at Coimbra

of the courtesies received from this savant, and I presented to your Excellency
at the proper time the books of which I was the bearer."

    Prof. deSouza then proceeds toconsiderthe results of his journey, and its bear-

ing on the establishment of his own hoped-for observatory. Having obtained

permission to employ the funds available in the current year in the purchase
of magnetic instruments, he wrote to General Sabine, asking him to bespeak
for him both the self-registering instruments, and those for absolute deter-

minations (as will be specified in the sequel), with any further improvements

that he mightdeem desirable. He had previously consulted General Sabine

on an important question, that of the choice between the different dimensions
of the magnets in use at Greenwich and at Kew, and says that " the
instructive reflections so obtained " had left him " completely satisfied in

determining for the Kew dimensions."

   In regard to the locality, it appears that the University of Coimbra does not
possess any building suitable and available for the purpose ; but the Kector
pointed out a site which appeared to M. de Souza highly suitable, if he could

assure himself that the ferruginous particles contained in the new red sandstone

rock would not be objectionable. He sent specimens of the rock (a well-

known one in England) through the Portuguese Ambassador to London, and
experiments made with them discovered no sensible magnetic action. But
although this doubt was thus satisfactorily removed, unfortunately the site in
question is private property, and means are wanting both for its purchase

and for the building. He presses on the authorities the urgency of this

provision being made without further delay, and states that the plan proposed,
after full consultations, and for which Mr. Beckley has offered to make the
drawings, combines the greatest economy with all that can be desired
scientifically. Finally, he discusses the question of meteorological instru-
ments, and concludes for obtaining them also from England, proposing to
devote to this purpose the means at his disposal up to the termination of the

University year in 1862.

       Second Visit to the Kew Observatory.

Hearing on the 5th of July (1861) from General Sabine that the magnetic

instruments were nearly ready for trial and verification, lie proposed to devote
his approaching holidays to profit by the opportunity of gaining practical
instruction and experience in their use proposing at the same time to study

Professor Thomson's electrometer the only apparatus, he says, which holds
out the hope of satisfying the present exigences of science, which require
continuous registration--and to obtain the other meteorological instruments

and compare them with the Kew standards.

   The first part of the report is dated July 25, 1861; the second part

November 16, 1861, and gives an account of his second visit to the Kew

Observatory. It is prefaced by acknowledgements of the kindness and help
he received from Messrs. Stewart and Chambers at the Observatory, from
General Sabine, Mr. Gassiot, and the whole of the " directing Committee,"
from the British Association, and from the Royal Society.

   He arrived in London on the 24th of August, and finding General Sabine

absent in Wales, proceeded at once to the artists, Adie, Barrow, and Gibson,

who informed him that his instruments were at Kew, whither he lost no time
in repairing, and where the Director arranged that the work should begin at
once. Prof, de Souza took up his abode at Richmond, and went daily to the
Observatory, remaining there from 9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. He speaks of the

great kindness, instruction, and constant assistance which he received from

the Director and the whole personal staff of the Observatory, in their different
degrees and functions, in the practical study of the instruments. This study
consists, he says, in setting them up in the trial house precisely as they are
to be set up at Coimbra, in determining their constants, in repeatedly
observing the magnetic elements with them and comparing the results with
those of the Observatory, and in reducing these observations. In the course
of the observations some little faults, which would otherwise have escaped
notice, were discovered in the instruments ; to correct these the artists were
repeatedly called to Kew, or the Director conferred with them in London.

   The collection of magnetic instruments consists, firstly, of the magneto-

graphs which register continuously the horizontal force, the vertical force,
and the declination ; and, secondly, of the portable instruments, viz. Barrow's
circle for the absolute determination of the inclination, with the apparatus
for determining the total force by Dr. Lloyd's method ; and the unifilar, by
Gibson, with its apparatus for the absolute determinations of the declination,
and of the horizontal force by the method of vibrations and deflections.

   The magnetographs are accompanied by three telescopes, for the direct
observation of the magnetic elements when requisite, and by all things

--necessary for beginning work as soon as they are established utensils

for photographic manipulation, a year's supply of chemical ingredients,

waxed paper, spare bell-glasses, chimneys and mirrors, coloured glasses for
the photographic house, <fcc. The portable instruments, which are indispen-
sable in an observatory, being also proper for the observations of a magnetic
survey, are conveniently packed in portable boxes, and accompanied by a

tripod stand.

   The existence of the Astronomical Observatory at Coimbra makes it possible
to dispense with a transit-instrument and clocks, but a good chronometer is
essential ; and by the kind aid of the Hydrographer, Admiral Washington, to

whom General Sabine wrote on the subject, Prof, de Souza received permission

to purchase one of those examined at Greenwich, and guaranteed by the
Astronomer Royal, at the price which would be paid for the same by the

British Admiralty.

    "Besides the barometer required for the ordinary direct observations,"
                            ;

ON THE OBSERVATORY AT KEW.  115

Prof, de Souza desired an absolute standard such as is at Kew. So large a tube

could neither be filled by the ordinary method, nor, of course, transported

full. The course taken was therefore to learn at Kew how to perform the

filling process by Mr. ."Welsh's method, so as to put it in practice at Coimbra.

The experiment was made with two glass tubes of ordinary size, of which

Prof, de Souza filled and closed one in the proposed manner, and Mr. Casella

the other, with equal success.

   Prof, de Souza then ordered from Mr. Casella two tubes of large dimension,

very clean and the air exhausted, with the cistern and all the appurtenances of

the barometer to be made with one of them. If he succeeds, according to his
hopes, as he did at Kew, Coimbra, he 6ays, will possess an absolute standard,

which will be the standard for Portugal as that of Kew is for England. But

he proposes not to order the cathetometer until the tube is actually filled and

raised into its proper position. He then gives the list of the other meteoro-

logical instruments, all verified at Kew.

  "A standard thermometer graduated in divisions of 0-2 Centigrade. It

was one of the best old tubes in the possession of the Observatory, only

wanting the graduation, which was skilfully performed under my sight by the

young George "Whipple, assistant at the Observatory.

   " Two psychrometers with divisions of 0-5 Centigrade.

  A" maximum registering thermometer on Professor Phillips's principle.
  A" minimum registering spirit thermometer.
  A" minimum registering mercurial thermometer ; a recent invention of
Mr. Casella, which was tried at Kew with a good result, and may be advan-

tageously substituted for the spirit thermometer, of which the defects have
long been recognized by meteorologists.

  A" Herschel'6 actinometer.
  A" spirit thermometer for registering terrestrial radiation, with a suitable

parabolic mirror.

   " Two rain-gauges.

  A" vaporimeter with the corresponding pluviometer."

   With the above, and a pluviometer and hygrometer of Eegnault, and an
anemograph by Salleron belonging to the Cabinet de Physique at Coimbra
(which requires to receive some modifications), Prof, de Souza considers

that an equipment is provided for immediate work, contemplating eventually
the addition of " apparatus for the continuous registry of barometric and
thermometric variations, the cost of which will be under £120."

   The continuous registry of atmospheric electricity by the photographic
process must be given up for the present : Professor Thomson's electrometer,

excellent in principle, leaves, however, somewhat to be desired in practice.

Prof, de Souza examined the one at Kew with great attention, watching its

march carefully, and afterwards having it taken to pieces ; and he is of opinion,
as is also Mr. Stewart, that slight modifications would obviate some of the
defects to which it is liable.

   Mr. Beckley has drawn a plan and elevation for the Observatory at
Coimbra, which is submitted to the Council of the University : it provides
both for the instruments which have been ordered, and for such as may, it is
hoped, be subsequently acquired, these being a barograph and thermograph
and possibly hereafter a photo-heliograph for obtaining images of the solar
spots, especially with a view to their supposed relations to magnetic pheno-

mena. The cost of a photo-heliograph would now be about £80. In a few
years many improvements will probably be made in it, and meantime what
is wanted for this particular object may be supplied by observations of the

                                                                                    i2
116 REPORT--1862.

solar spots with an ordinary telescope, or by data obtained by the Astrono-

mical Observatory as part of its own work.

    Besides the excellent collection of magnetic instruments (one of the finest
and most complete in existence, with scrupulously determined constants)
which is thus placed in the possession of the University of Coimbra, Prof, de
Souza has blank forms for the record of all the observations, and the formirioe

for their reduction, collected both from the instruction given to him at Kew,
and from his own careful examination of the manuscript books of the Ob-

servatory.

    The magnetic instruments have arrived safely at Coimbra, and measures
have been taken for the similar conveyance of the meteorological instruments.

    Mr. Beckley's drawings furnish all the data for the construction of the

building, which will be simple and of small cost. An estimate, M. de

Souza says, is appended ; but it does not appear in the printed report.

    M. de Souza further alludes to his having reported, both to the University
and to the Government, his attendance at the Meeting of the British Associa-
tion at Manchester, as a member of its Committee of Mathematics and Physics,
where he was enabled to enter into relations with the distinguished men

assembled there from all pai'ts, some of whom were Directors of Observatories,
who promised the accounts of their results, and would doubtless expect his.

The British Association has granted a complete copy of their annual Reports
from the commencement, and with these and the works previously received,
the Coimbra establishment would find itself at once in possession of a good

library of tbe best writings on the subjects of its investigations. He once

more recalls all the kindness and assistance he received in England, adding
that the Eoyal Society granted ^30 from their " Donation-fund " for the
expenses of the verification of the magnetic instruments prepared for the
Coimbra Observatory, and concludes by urging the completion of the arrange-
ments for an establishment which he trusts will prove alike honourable to
his University and to his country.

Report on the Dredging of the Northumberland Coast and Dogger Bank,

   drawn up by Henry T. Mennell, on behalf of the Natural History

    Society of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle-on-Tyne, and
    of the Tyneside Naturalists' Field Club.

The Committee to whom the grant of the Association for " Dredging on the
Dogger Bank and tbe coasts of Northumberland and Durham " was entrusted

having, at the request of the Natural History Society of Northumberland,
Durham, and Newcastle-on-Tyne, and of the Tyneside Naturalists' Field
Club, courteously committed the practical carrying out of the proposed inves-

tigations to these bodies, their members contributed the large sum required
in addition to the Association grant, and I have now to report the result of

our labours.
 , Tlie dredging took place at the end of August ; hence the time which has
since elapsed has been too limited to do full justice to the specimens obtained

in many departments.
   It was confined to the following localities: 1st, on a line due east of

Tynemouth, extending to the Dogger Bank, a distance of about 100 miles.
   The dredging commenced about twenty miles from land, was resumed at
--:

ON THE DREDGING OF THE NORTHUMBERLAND COAST.                                                            117

about fifty miles from land, and continued at intervals of about five miles
for the remainder of the distance.

    The depth of water never exceeded 40 fathoms, and ranged chiefly from
25 to 35 fathoms, the bottom being mainly composed of fine sand and ooze.

   On the second cruise, the coast twenty miles off Coquet Island, and twenty

to thirty miles off Berwick, was thoroughly dredged ; in the latter locality the

water attained a depth of 55 fathoms, being the deepest we possess off the
Northumberland coast. The bottom consisted of coarse sand and gravel.

   The vessel employed was a steamer.
   The following gentlemen have, at the request of the two Societies, prepared
lists of the specimens obtained, and are responsible for the determination of

the species, viz. :

Mollusca (except Tunicata), Mr. H. T. Mennell.

The results, as arrived at by these gentlemen, are summarized below.
Of Mollusca 136 species were obtained, viz.

Cephalopoda                                                         1 Proso- Opistho- Nudi-brancbiata.

                                                                  11

                                              136

   No species new to science was obtained, and but one previously unrecorded

as British. This is the Cynthia glacialis of Sars, two specimens of which had
been previously obtained by Mr. John Stanger on the Northumberland coast,
and noticed in the Tyneside Club Transactions under the provisional name of
Cynthia vestita (Alder). It has since been ascertained, however, that Professor
Sars had taken the species on the Norwegian coast, and published it in 1858

under the name we now adopt.

    Pour other species were added to those recorded in Mr. Alder's excellent
" Catalogue of the Mollusca of Northumberland and Durham," published in the

' Tyneside Club Transactions,' viz. Rissoa sculpta (Forbes and Hanley), new

to the east coast of Britain, Eulima nitida (Lamarck), Eulima gracilis (Alder,
MS.), and Syndosmya intermedia.

    Several species hitherto considered to be of great rarity on our coast were
obtained in some plenty, e.g. Trophon Barvicensis, Mangelia Trevelyana,
Chemnitzia fidvocincta, Scalaria Trevelyana, Trochus millegnmus, Puncturella
Noachina, and Lucina flexuosa. Of the rarer species previously recorded,
there were found, but not abundantly, Mangelia teres, Natica Grcenlandica,
Philine quadrata, Cylichna strigella, Crenella decussata, and Neaira cuspidata.
Of the special varieties of the Dogger Bank which have hitherto only been
taken on the fishing-lines, the only trace obtained was a single capsule of
Fusus Turtoni. Further efforts are therefore required to ascertain the exact
habitat on our coast of the rare larger Fusi, of Buccinum (?) Dalei and Pano-

pcsa Norvegiea. "When this is discovered we may expect to find associated
with them many interesting Boreal species, perhaps too small to have attracted

 the attention of the fishermen.

    Some interest attaches to the subfossil or upper tertiary shells which were
 dredged in very deep water twenty to thirty miles east of Berwick. Amongst

these were Astarte ellipticd and Mya truncata, var. Uddevallensis, neither of

 which have been found living on our coast, and Margarita cinerea, an extinct
 species, which has been recently dredged under similar conditions in other

 localities.

    The whole of the Crustacea which were obtained have not as yet been
 examined ; but among those already determined are many of great interest.

 In all about 90 species were dredged. Among the Podophthahnia, mention
 may be made oilnaclius Dorsettensis as new to the N.E. coast of England, and

 of Crangon spinosus, bispinosus, and Altmanni. The last of these, a recently
 distinguished species, was abundant both off the Durham and Northumberland
 coasts. From several specimens of Hippolyte securifrons which were obtained,
 Mr. Norman is enabled to correct an error in the specific character which he
 gave at the last meeting of the Association, from the Shetland type specimen.

 He finds that there are four instead of three pairs of spines on the front

 margin of the carapace, two spines being placed together over each orbit.

    Both sexes of Mysis spiritus (Norman), only previously known from three
 or four females taken near Hartlepool, were dredged in considerable numbers
 and also an undescribed species of the same genus, which Mr. Norman thus

  describes :

     "Mysis didelphys (Norman, n. sp.).
     " Antennal scale lanceolate, twice as long as the eye, two-jointed, ciliated
 all round ; the second joint very short, with a rounded apex terminating in
 five cilia. Telson entire, not more than two-thirds the length of the in-
 termediate, and half the length of the external laminaj of the tail; lateral mar-
 gins of telson armed with ten spines, some of which are situated quite at the
 base ; apex with a large spine at each corner, but no central intermediate

  spines.

     " This is a much stouter species than Mysis vidgaris, to which it is nearly
 allied. The antennal scale is less produced ; and the second joint is much

 shorter, and terminates in five cilia instead of in an acutely pointed spine.
 The telson is likewise shorter, with fewer lateral spines, and without the two
 intermediate apical spines which are present in Mi vulgaris. Mysis didelphys

 was dredged in deep water, forty miles off the coast, while the habitat of M.

 vulgaris appears to be invariably the brackish waters of estuaries and salt-
  marshes."

     The curious and abnormal family of the Diastylidae was well represented
 by Diastylis Raihkii, Eudora truncatula, Vaunthomsonia cristata, and three
 undescribed species. These are thus named and described by Mr. Norman :

     " Cuma rosea (Norman, n. sp.).
     " Last five segments of the thorax uncovered by the carapace. No abdominal

  legs. Carapace unarmed above and below, rounded in front. Telson well

  developed, as long as the basal portion of the caudal appendages, furnished
  with two spines on each side, and having the rounded apex closely surrounded

  by seven subequal spines. Colour white, mottled with rosy spots. Dredged
  50-60 miles east of Tynemouth.

      " Cyrianassa elegans (Norman, n. sp.).
      " Only three pairs of abdominal legs, which are the appendages of the first
  three segments. Telson produced, as long as the basal joints of the caudal
                                                     ---- ;

ON THE DREDGING OF THE NORTHUMBERLAND COAST.                      119

appendages, armed with a spine on each 8ide and eight spines around the

extremity. Deep water off Tynemouth.

" Cyrianassa cilidta (Norman, n. sp.).
" Carapace hispid, truncate in front, and furnished with a toothed process on

the antero-lateral margin. Lower antennae longer than the body. Five seg-

ments of the thorax uncovered by the carapace. Abdominal legs, two pairs,

attached to the first two segments. Telson short, one-third the length of

the basal joint of the lateral appendages, with a rounded unarmed extremity.

Caudal appendages furnished with plumose cilia, which are remarkably long

on the outer branch. Deep water off Tynemouth."

Among the more interesting Amphipoda obtained were Montagua Alderii

and pollexiana, Callisoma crenata, Anonyx dentieidatus, Ampelisca Gaimardi

and Belliana, Phoxus plumosus, Ipjhimedia obesa, Acanthonotus testudo, Atylus

bisphiosus, Microdeutopus anomalus, Caprella lobata, Dexamine Vedlomensis,

Kroyera altamarina, and Melita proximo,. Of the last three species only the

type specimens were previously known.

Two Entomostraca were dredged which are new to the British fauna,

Cypridina globosa (Liljeborg) and Ichthyophorba hamata (Liljeborg), and a

third, new to science, thus described by Mr. Norman :

" Cythere limicola (Norman, n. sp.).

" Carapace-valves slightly quadrilateral, front margins oblique, greatest

height at the anterior third. Sculptured with two elevated, lougitudinal, slightly

curved parallel lines on the lower half of the valves, from the anterior

extremity of which a transverse elevated line passes to the hinge-margin,

where it terminates in a large tubercle. Two similar tubercles close together

near the hinder extremity of the hinge-margin."

Among the other Entomostraca were Nebalia bipes, Cythere quadridentata

and acuta, and what is perhaps a variety of flavkla, Cythereis jimbriata,

Evadne Nordmanni, and Anomalocera Patersonii.

Of Pycnogonoidea (which we only separate from the Crustacea because

they have been on this occasion examined by different gentlemen, and not

as expressing an opinion that they should be so separated) ten species were

obtained, belonging to four genera, Pycnogonum, Phoxichilidium, Pallene, and

Nymplwn. Of these, two are new to Britain and two are new to science

the latter are thus described by Mr. George Hodge :

" Pallene attenuata, n. sp., Hodge.

"Rostrum thick, constricted at the base, swollen near the middle, and

rounded at the apex. Legs long, sparingly hispid ; first, second, and third

joints short, the second the longer ; fourth rather stout, and as long as the

second and third united ; fifth and sixth slender, and about the length of the

fourth ; seventh very short ; eighth convex on the outer margin, straight on

Athe inner, with a few short hairs scattered along both margins.  single

claw at the extremity, which, when pressed against the limb, reaches to the

junction of the seventh joint. Eoot-jaws long and slender, projecting con-

siderably beyond the end of the rostrum. Anterior portion of thorax

attenuated, and advanced nearly in a line with the tip of the rostrum, where

it slightly bulges and gives origin to foot-jaws, immediately behind which

is seated the oculiferous tubercle, which is long and narrow. Abdomen long,

rounded at apex, slightly tapering to base. At the origin of each leg on the

dorsal aspect is a large wart-like protuberance.

   " Nymphon brevirostris, n. sp., Hodge.

   " Rostrum short and stout ; foot-jaws thick, divergent, second joint or hand

nearly as long as the first; palpi five-jointed, brush-like, first and second
        --;

--120 REPORT 1862.

joints long and nearly of the same length, either of them equal to the three
terminal joints, the last of which is the shortest. Thorax robust. Abdomen
stout and conical. Oculiferous tubercle midway between the first pair of
legs. Legs stout, sparingly furnished with stout spine-like hairs ; first and
third joints short ; second slender at its origin, swelling upwards ; fourth and
fifth joints each as long as the first three ; sixth much longer, and slender
seventh short; eighth long, slightly bent, furnished along its inner margin
with a few short spines, and terminating in one moderately large and two

small claws."

   Two species of Nymplwn new to Britain were also taken, viz. Nymphon

hirtum, 0. Fabr., and N. brevitarse, Kroyer.
   The rarity of male Nymphons is singular ; none were obtained during the

expedition, although the number of females was considerable : on the contrary,
the males of Pycnoyonum were abundant, and the females rarely seen. This

seems to be the usual experience of collectors.

   The researches of Mr. Hodge into the development and structure of the
Pycnogonidse have led him to place them with the Entomostraca, as an order
of that subclass, Araehnopoda or Pycnoyonoidea.

  A great number of Annelids were dredged, but these have not yet been

catalogued ; we trust, however, next year to present a satisfactory list of these
animals. Sipunaihis Bernhardus was one of the most abundant species, occu-
pying every dead Dentalium which was brought up. It may be remarked also

that in the deepest water dredged, that is, off Berwick, the dredge showed the
bottom to consist almost entirely of fragments of the deserted tubes of these

creatures. Few opportunities existed of obtaining Entozoa ; those that did

occur were not neglected, but the number was so meagre that no list has been

attempted.

   Of Echinodermata wo dredged twenty-seven species ; amongst these is one
species of Opliiura hitherto undescribed, of which Mr. G. Hodge, who had
a short time before taken it on the Durham coast, gives the following

description :

   " Ophiura Normani (n. sp., George Hodge).
    "Disk either pentangular or round, the former pertaining to well-grown,
the latter to young specimens. Upper surface of disk rotulatcd, under

surface corresponding with that of the other members of the genus. Two

clasping scales at the origin of each ray, each bearing about ten short spines.

A crescent of eight or ten short blunt spines on the upper surface of the rays,

close to the disk. Lateral ray-plates bearing five moderately long spines.

Upper ray-scales nearly square, slightly tapering towards the disk. Bays
about four times as long as the diameter of the disk, which in well-grown

individuals measures about ^ of an inch. Colour reddish yellow, occasionally
of a pale sandy tint."

   The Rev. A. M. Norman has also taken a single specimen of this species in

the Clyde, and three or four in the Shetlands.

   Bryssus lyrifer, a species previously considered to be of much rarity on the
coast, was met with in great plenty and of unusual size ; still more abundant

were Spatangus purpureas and Amphidotus roseus.

   All the species of Ophiuroidea, Asteroidea, and Echinoidea were much
more plentiful on the muddy ground which lies immediately within the
Dogger Bank than elsewhere.

    Uraster rosea, a fine species not before met with on the east coast, was
added to the local fauna.

   Among the Holothuridse, several specimens of a small Thyonidium were

dredged in Berwick Bay, which appear to be the Holothuria pellucida of
Midler, and not the Cuciimaria hyalina of Forbes, the latter of which appears
to belong to the genus Thyone. Should a further examination confirm this

view, the species is new to Britain.
   Thyonidium commune was also added to our loeal fauna.
   No Zoophytes were obtained previously unrecorded in Mr. Joshua Alder's

" Catalogue of the Zoophytes of Northumberland and Durham," published in

the ' Transactions of the T}-nesidc Club ;' nevertheless the list is a good one,

containing as it does 77 species, viz.

                        Polyzoa    27
                        Hydrozoa   40
                        Actinozoa  10

                                   77

Among the Polyzoa, Menipea ternata and CeJhdaria Peacldi, two northern

deep-water species rare on other parts of the English coast, were procured in

considerable abundance. Of Biujula Murrayana and B. fastiyiata, also

northern forms, only two or three specimens were obtained.

   Among the Hydrozoa the most noteworthy is Sertularia fusca, a species

peculiar to the north-eastern coasts of England and to Scotland. Sertularia

'pinaster was also met with, and S. tamarisca with female capsules.

   The Medusida? are not included in Mr. Alder's Catalogue just referred to,

and of these very few species were identified.

  A very fine and strikingly beautiful Medusa was, however, taken some

seventy or eighty miles from the coast, [which appears not to have been

hitherto met with in our seas ; nor, indeed, have we seen the description of

any genus to which it woxdd seem to be assignable.

   The Rev. A. M. Norman describes it as follows :
   " The hydrosoma is inverted cup-shaped, moderately convex, about 41

inches in diameter, tinged with deeper and paler shades of indigo-blue.

" The margin is divided into eight major lobes, each of which is subdivided

into four minor lobes, making thirty-two lobes in all. The disk of the hydro-

soma is elevated into sixteen radiating ridges, alternating with as many

Aintermediate furrows.  radiating canal, of an intenser blue than the rest

of the hydrosoma, passes down each of the ridges ; and these radiating canals

terminate in the deeper sinuses of the margin and in the central sinuses of

the major lobes, while each furrow is traversed by a white vessel whose

distal extremity is situated at one of the intermediate sinuses of the major
lobes. Numerous transverse branches proceed from the blue and elevated

canals, and pass down the slopes of the ridges to the base of the furrows.

These transverse vessels are recognized by the deeper tint of blue which

marks their course.
   " There are no tentacles on the margin of the disk ; but, situated a short

distance within the margin, opposite each of the greater sinuses, there is
seen a semicircle of about forty pale-yellow simple tentacles, which are so

short that they scarcely hang below the margin of the disk. The horns of

the semicircle of tentacles point outwards.

   " There are eight eyes, which are placed at the centre of the major lobes,
on the blue canal, at a short distance from the margin.

   ** The oral appendages are greatly developed in the form of four (?) large,
many-folded, ochreous-yellow curtains, exquisitely margined with a short,
finely-cut fringe. The length of the curtains, as they hang suspended in the
hydrosoma, is somewhat greater than their united breadth.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    .

  --" The ovaries. I take it that the brownish-pink masses which were seen

suspended just outside the curtains in the living animal were the ovaries,
but, not having had the opportunity of examining these bodies, I hesitate to
state that they actually are the reproductive organs."

   The specimen described has been well preserved in a mixture of diluted
spirit and creosote

    In Actinozoa our list is not rich ; Stomphia ChurcMce (Gosse), and a Phellia
not yet ascertained, but probably the Phellia gausipata of Gosse (a species
hitherto only taken at Wick), are among the rarer species obtained.

    The list of Foraminifera is a very rich one, considering the short timo
and the limited area over which the dredging extended.

    Of the 101 species and varieties enumerated in Prof. Williamson's mono-
graph, our list contains 55 ; and besides these, several are reserved for further

examination.

    Fully twenty of those had not previously been found on our coast by
Mr. Joshua Alder or Mr. H. B. Brady, the only observers.

   The most noticeable facts respecting the Foraminifera obtained are, first,
the extraordinary prevalence of the various forms of Dentalina in the Berwick
Bay dredgings, occurring as they do in every gradation from the extreme

form of Dentalina subarcuata to the extreme of D. legumen. No line of

demarcation can be drawn between tho hyaline shell constricted at the septa
(the septal lines being oblique) and the more robust, much-curved form of

D. legumen. On the same ground PolymorpJiina frequently assumes the more
luxuriant form known as variety Jtstulosa. And secondly, the number and

beauty of the Lagenw, of which every British variety was taken, most of them

abundantly.

   Of the Sponges no list has been attempted, the very few species obtained

waiting further examination.
    Altogether, the results are, I trust, such as to justify further efforts on the

same coast ; and they are, at any rate, most interesting to our local natu-

ralists, who are, through the medium of the Tyneside Naturalists' Field

Club, working out the fauna of the district with a completeness which few
districts can equal.

Report of the Committee appointed at Manchester to consider and
   report upon the best means of advancing Science through the agency

   of the Mercantile Marine. By Cuthbert Collingwood, M.B.,

    F.L.S.

--The Committee appointed at the Manchester Meeting of the British Asso-

ciation consisted of the foliowin"Jo: ogev ntlemen :

Dr. Collingwood, Liverpool.     J. Aspinall Turner, M.P., Manchester.
E. Patterson, F.E.S., Belfast.  P. P. Carpenter, Ph.D., Warrington.

John Lubbock, F.R.S., London.   Rev. H. H. Higgins, M.A., Liverpool.

   Since that time much has been done in promoting the scheme suggested in

the paper then read before Section D. That paper has been printed in the
' Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool,' and
copies of it have been struck off, and very largely circulated among ship-
owners, merchants, and all the large and influential list of correspondents

to whom the documents of the Mercantile Marine Association of Liverpool are

usually forwarded. I have also forwarded copies to all whom I know to he

interested in the subject, and, in the volume of Proceedings, it has passed to all
the scientific societies in correspondence with the Liverpool Literary and
Philosophical Society. Mr. Robert Patterson, of Belfast, has brought the
subject under the notice of the shipping interest and the Natural History
Society of that town ; and many copies have been circulated in America
through Captain Anderson (of the R.M.S.S. ' China'), Professor Agassiz, and

Mr. "Wm. Stimpson of the Smithsonian Institution. Among those to whom

I forwarded copies of the paper was Mr. E. Newman, who reprinted it in
the ' Zoologist ' for July and August 1862. The subject has thus been

brought fairly before the mercantile and scientific public, and the attention

--of a large number of persons has been directed towards it the general

opinion being decidedly in its favour, on the score of advantages to be derived
at once by science and by philanthropy.

    In the autumn of 1861, in conversation with Earl Granville, Lord Pre-
sident of the Committee of Council on Education, I had an opportunity of
bringing the subject under his Lordship's notice, and of explaining to him
the advantages which we proposed to ourselves from this scheme, well know-
ing the important assistance which his Lordship might afford in case of its

meeting with his approval. He expressed an interest in the matter, and
desired to be further informed upon it. On the publication of the paper,

therefore, at his Lordship's request, I sent him a copy, and shortly after
received the following communication :

                                                     " Science and Art Department of the Committee of

15 Oxford Street, Liverpool."

 --The next important advance was as follows : It being considered of the

last importance that the sanction and cooperation of shipowners should
be obtained, a meeting was convened in the mayor's parlour, Town-hall,
Liverpool, at which some of the most influential shipowners of that port, as
well as the chairman and secretary of the Mercantile Marine Association,
were present ; Mr. T. M. Mackay (a gentleman ever ready to cooperate in
every scheme for the good of seamen) occupying the chair. The meeting
having been informed of the nature and progress of the movement, and the
subject having been discussed, the gentlemen present promised their support,
both nominal, and pecuniary if it were required.

   Believing that much might be effected by associating merchant-officers

with existing scientific societies, in an honorary manner, the reporter, as
Secretary to the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society, brought the
matter before the council and members. This Society, established in 1812,
 has just celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, and is the oldest scientific society

in Liverpool. An addition to the laws was duly passed and confirmed, to the

 effect that the Society " be empowered to elect as Associates masters of vessels or
 124 report--1862.

 others engaged in marine pursuits, who may have peculiar facilities for adding

 to the scientific interest of the Society's proceedings ; such Associates to be in

--every case recommended by the council, and to have the same privileges as

 honoraiy members their number to be limited to twenty-five." This plan,
 there is little doubt, may be productive of much good, and it is hoped will bo
 adopted by some other societies. It offers a stimulus to the intelligent ship-
 master, and tends to increase his self-respect, by showing that he is held in
 respect by those who appreciate his efforts to advance science and his own

 mental culture.
    Although it is hoped that in the course of time some tangible results

may be obtained in several branches of science, the writer, being chiefly
 interested in the science of zoology, determined to make a beginning by

 causing to be prepared plain directions for the study and preservation of

 animals in all parts of the world. It being evident that, if we are to expect
 anything from the mercantile marine, its members should be definitely in-
formed as to what we wish them to do, a committee of the Literary and Phi-

losophical Society was appointed, at the writer's suggestion, to draw up such
plain directions as should not fail to be sufficient for the end in view.
The preparation of such a paper was entrusted to Mr. T. J. Moore, curator
of the Liverpool Free Public Museum, a gentleman well qualified for the
task ; and having received the sanction of the Committee, the paper was
published as an Appendix to the ' Proceedings of the Literary and Philoso-
phical Society ' for 1861-62. It is entitled, " Suggestions offered on the part
of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool to Members of the

Mercantile Marine who may be desirous of using the advantages they enjoy

for the promotion of Science, in furtherance of Zoology," pp. 51. This
pamphlet, containing full directions for the preparation of all kinds of animals,
methods of study, and lists of text-books and useful apparatus, has been

separately published by the Society, for distribution in quarters where it is
likely to prove useful. It is desirable that such manuals for other sciences

should be also carefully compiled, in order that every intelligent seaman may
have scope to exercise his talents in whatever direction his own tastes may

conduct him ; and thus, there can be no doubt that a useful and valuable
body of scientific information would be collected to aid the researches of men
of science at home.

   It is much to be regretted that a united body of members of the mercan-

tile marine, such as the Mercantile Marine Service Association of Liverpool,
should not enter cordially into a scheme which they have themselves acknow-

ledged to be one fraught with usefulness. Had the executive council of this

Association shown an ordinary interest in its progress, still greater advances
would already have to be recorded ; but the writer is sorry to have to report
that he has not met with that assistance and cooperation from that body
which he felt entitled to look for. Although from the first invited to coope-
rate in the plans proposed, no steps have been taken by them, beyond the
tardy publication of some valuable suggestions urged upon them by one

member of the council (since resigned) and one of the most intelligent mem-
bers of the service. This lukewarmness of a body of men who, by their

example, might be of the most material assistance is likely to retard, although
not to destroy, the prospects of the scheme ; and could the services of a small
and active committee of influential gentlemen be secured, success must
ultimately crown their efforts.

    There can be no doubt whatever that it is to the rising generation of

seamen that we must chiefly look for the fruits of any scheme of improved
ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.  125

education which may be adopted in the present day, and such establish-
ments as the ' Conway ' training-frigate in the Mersey are powerfully useful

to that end ; still, in order to collect together the elements of scientific in-

dustry and laudable ambition, which doubtless exist, scattered among the
present body of merchant-seamen, it is desirable, as a beginning, to offer a

certificate of merit to such commanders and other oificers as hold the extra

certificate of the Marine Board, or who keep the meteorological log-book
supplied by the Observatory, or who show in various other ways a desire to

improve their minds and to encourage industry in those under their charge.
It must strictly be borne in mind, however, that the sea is the only place
where the sailor's mind can be properly influenced. Churches, schools, and

sailors' homes on shore are only attended by those whom better influences at
sea have inclined for good. Masters of vessels, therefore, who encourage

their apprentices to continue their studies at sea, and who open schools for
the purpose of teaching those who have had no benefits of education on shore,

are in the first place well deserving of some reward, such as a certificate of
merit, which should be so constructed and signed as to carry some weight.

The nature, therefore, of this certificate, and by whom it should be signed,

are questions of great importance to the success of the movement, and woidd
require mature consideration. If the Committee of Council on Education or
the Board of Trade, or both, could be induced to take an active and official

interest in the matter, the difficulty would be at once solved.

   It should be mentioned, as a practical encouragement of some value, that
the Colonial and Continental Church Society (9 Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street)

--has, through Captain Anderson, offered to grant libraries for sailors afloat,

on the following conditions : 1. The Council of the Mercantile Marine
Service Association are to recommend to them four captains each year, to

each of whom the above Society will grant a library, value £5. 2. It will

be understood that it is desirable to select such captains as have communi-
cation with our colonial possessions.

   Enough has now been said and done to prove that there is a current at
work, setting in the right direction ; and we can only now leave the matter

to time, feeling fully assured that it will go on, and bear ultimate fruit, both
in the advancement of science and in the elevation of the character of the
merchant-seaman.

       Provisional Report of the Committee appointed by the British

               Association on Standards of Electrical Resistance.

Members of the Committee :--Professor A. Williamson, F.E.S. ; Professor C.
      Wheatstone, E.R.S.; Professor W. Thomson, F.R.S.; Professor W. H.

       Miller, F.R.S. ; Dr. A. Matthiesson, F.R.S. ; Mr. P. Jenkin.

The Committee regret that they are unable this year to submit a final Ecport
to the Association, but they hope that the inherent difficulty and importance

of the subject they have to deal with will sufficiently account for the delay.
   The Committee considered that two distinct questions were before them,

admitting of entirely independent solutions. They had first to determine
what would be the most convenient unit of resistance ; and secondly, what
would be the best form and material for the standard representing that unit.
The meaning of this distinction will be apparent when it is observed that, if
                                                                  ;

--126 report 1862.

tbe first point were decided by a resolution in favour of a unit based on

Proffeessssoor Weber's or Sir Cbarles Bright and Mr. Latimer Clark's system, tbis

decision would not affect tbe question of construction ; while, on the other

hand, if the second question were decided in favour of any particular arrange-

ment of mercury or gold wire as the best form of standard, tbis choice would

not affect the question of what the absolute magnitude of the unit was to be.

The Committee have arrived at a provisional conclusion as to the first

question ; and tbe arguments by which they have been guided in coming to

this decision will form the chief subject of tbe present Report.  ·

They have formed no opinion as to the second question, or the best form

and material for the standard.

   In determining what would be the most convenient unit for all purposes,
both practical and purely scientific, the Committee were of opinion that tbe
unit chosen should combine, as far as was possible, tbe five following quabties.

   1. The magnitude of the unit should be such as would lend itself to the
more usual electrical measurements, without requiring the use of extravagantly

high numbers of ciphers or of long series of decimals.

   2. The unit should bear a definite relation to units which may be adopted

for the measurement of electrical quantity, currents, and electromotive force

or, in other words, it should form part of a complete system for electrical

measurements.

   3. The unit of resistance, in common with the other units of the system,

should, so far as is possible, bear a definite relation to the unit of work, the

great connecting link between all physical measurements.

4. The unit should be perfectly definite, and should not be Hable to require

coi'rection or alteration from time to time.

   5. The unit should be reproducible -with exactitude, in order that, if the
original standard were injured, it might be replaced, and also in order that
observers who may be unable to obtain copies of the standard may be able to

manufacture one for themselves without serious error.

   The Committee were also of opinion that the unit should be based on tbe
French metrical system, rather than on that now used in this country.

Fortunately no very long use can be pleaded in favour of any of the units

of electrical resistance hitherto proposed, and the Committee were therefore
at Hberty to judge of each proposal by its inherent merits only ; and they
bebeve that, by tbe plan which they propose for adoption, a unit will be

obtained combining to a great extent the five quabties enumerated as desi-

rable, although they cannot yet say with certainty how far the fourth quabty,

of absolute permanency, can be ensured.

The question of the most convenient magnitude was decided by reference

to those units which have already found some acceptance. These, omitting

for the moment Weber's          -, were found to range between one foot of

                        seconds

copper wire weighing one hundred grains (a unit proposed by Professor

Wheatstone in 1843) and one mile of copper wire of -j^th in. in diameter,

and weighing consequently about 841 grains per foot. The smaller units

had generally been used by purely scientific observers, and the larger by

engineers or practical electricians.

Intermediate between the two lay Dr. Werner Siemens's mercury unit, and

the unit adopted by Professor W. Thomson as approximately equal to one

hundred millions of absolute          --.

                                          ' The former is approximately equal to

                                seconds
ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.  127

371 feet, and the latter to 1217 feet, of pure copper wire TLth in. in diameter
at 15° C. Both of these units have heen adopted in scientific experiments
and in practical tests ; and it was thought that the absolute magnitude of
the unit to be adopted should not differ widely from these resistances.

   The importance of the second quality required in the unit, that of forming
part of a coherent system of electrical measurements, is felt not only by
purely scientific investigators, but also by practical electricians, and was
indeed ably pointed out in a paper read before this Association in Manchester
by Sir Charles Bright and Mr. Latimer Clark.

   The Committee has thus found itself in the position of determining not
only the unit of resistance, but also the units of current, quantity, and electro-
motive force. The natural relations between these units are, clearly, that a
unit electromotive force maintained between two points of a conductor
separated by the unit of resistance shall produce the unit current, and that
this current shall in the unit of time convey the unit quantity of electricity.

   The first relation is a direct consequence of Ohm's law ; and the second was
independently chosen by Weber and by the two electricians above named.

   Two only of the above units can be arbitrarily chosen ; when these are

fixed, the others follow from the relations just stated.
    Sir Charles Bright and Mr. Latimer Clark propose the electromotive force

of a Daniell's cell as one unit, and choose a unit of quantity depending on

this electromotive force. Their resistance-unit, although possessing what we
have called the second requisite quality, and superior consequently to many
that have been proposed, does not in any way possess the third quality of

bearing with its co-units a definite relation to the unit of work, and has

therefore been considered inferior to the equally coherent system proposed

by Weber many years since, but until lately comparatively little known in

this country.

   Professor Weber chose arbitrarily the unit of current and the unit of

electromotive force, each depending solely on the units of mass, time, and
length, and consequently independent of the physical properties of any arbi-

trary material.

   Professor W. Thomson has subsequently pointed out that this system
possesses what we have called the third necessary quality, since, when defined

in this measure, the unit current of electricity, in passing through a conductor

of unit resistance, does a unit of work or its equivalent in a unit of time*.
   The entire connexion between the various units of measurement in this

system may be summed up as follows.

  A battery or rheomotor of unit electromotive force will generate a current

of unit strength in a circuit of unit resistance, and in the unit of time will
convey a unit quantity of electricity through this circuit, and do a unit of
work or its equivalent.

   An infinite number of systems might fulfil the above conditions, which

leave the absolute magnitude of the units undetermined.

   Weber has proposed to fix the scries in various ways, of which two only

--need be mentioned here first by reference to the force exerted by the current

on the pole of a magnet, and secondly by the attraction which equal quantities
of electricities exert on one another when placed at the unit distance.

    In the first or electro -magnetic system, the unit current is that of which the
unit length at a unit distance exerts a unit of force on the unit magnetic
pole, the definition of which is dependent on the units of mass, time, and

   * Vide " Application of Electrical Effect to the Measurement of Electromotive Force,"
Phil. Mag. 1851.
128 report--1862.

length alone. In the second or electro-static system, the series of units is
fixed by the unit of quantity, which Weber defines as that quantity which
attracts another equal quantity at the unit distance with the unit force.

    Starting from these two distinct definitions, "Weber, by the relations
defined above, has framed two distinct systems of electrical measurement,

--and has determined the ratio between the units of the two systems a matter

of great importance in many researches ; but the electro-magnetic system is

more convenient than the other for dynamic measurements, in which currents,
resistances, &c, are chiefly determined from observations conducted with the
aid of magnets.

   As an illustration of this convenience, we may mention that the common

tangent galvanometer affords a ready means of determining the value in
electro-magnetic units of any current y in function of the horizontal com-
ponent of the earth's magnetism H, the radius of the coil R, its length L,
and the deflexion S,

                                      y=tang. 2 -j-.

    In this Report, wherever Professor Weber's, or Thomson's, or the absolute
system is spoken of, the electro-magnetic system only is to be understood as
referred to. The immense value of a coherent system, such as is here described,

can only be appreciated by those who seek after quantitative as distinguished
from merely qualitative results. The following elementary examples will

illustrate the practical application of the system.

   It is well known that the passage of a current through a metal conductor
heats that conductor ; and if we wish to know how much a given conductor
will be heated by a given current in a given time, we have only to multiply

the time into the resistance and the square of the current, and divide the
product by the mechanical eqiuvalent of the thermal unit. The quotient
will express the quantity of heat developed, from which the rise of tempera-
ture can be determined with a knowledge of the mass and specific heat of the

conductor.

   Again, let it be required to find how much zinc must necessarily be con-
sumed in a Daniell's cell or battery to maintain a given current through a
given resistance. The heat developed by the consumption of a unit of zinc

in a Daniell's battery has been determined by Dr. Joule, as also the mechanical

equivalent of that heat ; and we have only to multiply the square of the

current into the resistance, and divide by the mechanical equivalent of that
heat, to obtain the quantity of zinc consumed per unit of time.

   Again, do we wish to calculate the power which must necessarily be used

to generate by a magneto-electric machine a given current of (say) the strength

known to be required for a given electric light.
    Let the resistance of the circuit be determined, and the power required will

be simply obtained by multiplying the resistance into the square of the current.
    Again, the formula for deducing the quantity of electricity contained in the

charge of a Leyden jar or submarine cable from the throw of a galvanometer
needle depends on the relation between the unit expressing the strength of

current, the unit of force, and the unit magnet-pole. When these are expressed

in the above system, the quantity in electro -magnetic measure is immediately
obtained from the ballistic fornmla. In estimating the value of the various
insulators proposed for submarine cables, this measure is of at least equal
importance with the measure of the resistance of the conductor and of the
insulating sheath ; and the unit in which it is to be expressed would be at
onco settled by the adoption of the general system described.
            ON STANDARDS- OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.                                   129

            These four very simple examples of the use of Weber's and Thomson's

system might be multiplied without end, but it is hoped that they will suffice

to give some idea of the range and importance of the relations on which it

depends to those who may hitherto not have had then' attention directed to

the dynamical theory.

            No doubt, if every unit were arbitrarily chosen, the relations would still

exist hi nature, and, by a liberal use of coefficients experimentally determined,

the answer to all the problems depending on these relations might still be

calculated; but the number of these coefficients and the complication re-

sulting from their use would render such an arbitrary choice inexcusable.

  A large number of units of resistance have from time to time been proposed,

founded simply on some arbitrary length and section or weight of some given

material more or less suited for the purpose ; but none of these units in any
way possessed what we have called the second and third requisite qualities,

and could only have been accepted if the unit of resistance had been entirely

Weisolated from all other measurements.                have already shown how far this

is from being the case ; and the Committee consider that, however suitable

mercury or any other material may be for the construction or reproduction of

a standard, this furnishes no reason for adopting a foot or a metre length of
some arbitrary section or weight of that material.

   Nevertheless it was apparent that, although a foot of copper or a metre of
mercury might not be very scientific standards, they produced a perfectly

definite idea in the minds of even ignorant men, and might possibly, with

certain precautions, be both permanent and reproducible, whereas Weber's

unit has no material existence, but is rather an abstraction than an entity.
In other words, a metre of mercury or some other arbitrary material might

possess what we have called the first, fourth, and fifth requisite qualities, to a

higli degree, although entirely wanting in the second and third. Weber's

system, on the contrary, is found to fulfil the second and third conditions, but

is defective in the fourth and fifth ; for if the absolute or Weber's unit were

adopted without qualification, the material standard by which a decimal

multiple of convenient magnitude might be practically represented would

require continual correction as successive determinations made with more and
more skill determined the real value of the absolute unit with greater and

greater accuracy. Few defects could be more prejudicial than this continual

shifting of the standard. This objection would not be avoided even by a
determination made with greater accuracy than is expected at present, and
was considered fatal to the unqualified adoption of the absolute unit as the

standard of resistance.

It then became matter for consideration whether the advantages of the

arbitrary material standard and those of the absolute system could not be

combined, and the following proposal was made and adopted as the most

likely to meet every requirement. It was proposed that a material standard

should be prepared in such form and materials as should ensure the most

absolute permanency; that this standard should approximate as nearly

as possible in the present state of science to ten millions of -             re

                                                                                 , but

                                                                             seconds

that, instead of being called by that name, it should be known simply as the

unit of 1862, or should receive some other simpler name, such as that proposed

by Sir Charles Bright and Mr. Latimer Clark in the paper above referred

to          that from time to  time, as  the  advance  of  science  renders  this possible,

seconds

error resulting from the use of the 1862 unit in dynamical calculations instead

of the true absolute unit may be corrected by those who require these correc-

tions, but that the material standard itself shall under no circumstances be

altered in substance or definition.

   By this plan the first condition is fulfilled ; for the absolute magnitude of

this standard will differ by only 2 or 3 per cent, from Dr. Siemens's mercury

standard.

   The second and third conditions will be fulfilled with such accuracy as
science at any time will allow.

   The fourth condition, of permanency, will be ensured so far as our know-
ledge of the electrical qualities of matter will permit; and even the fifth

condition, referring to the reproduction, is rendered comparatively easy of

accomplishment.

   There are two reasons for desiring that a standard should be reproducible

first, in order that if the original be lost or destroyed it may be replaced
secondly, in order that men unable to obtain copies of the true standard may

approximately produce standards of their own. It is indeed hoped that accurate

copies of the proposed material standard will soon be everywhere obtainable,

and that a man will no more think of producing his own standard than of

deducing his foot rule from a pendulum, or his metre from an arc of the

meridian ;  and  wiit11        be  one  of  the  duties  of  the  Committee  to  facilitate  the

                            .

obtaining of such copies, which can be made with a thousandfold greater

accuracy than could be ensured by any of the methods of reproduction

hitherto proposed.

   It is also hoped that no reproduction of the original standard may ever be

necessary. Nevertheless great stress has been lately laid upon this quality,
and two methods of reproduction have been described by Dr. "Werner Siemens
and Dr. Matthiessen respectively ; the former uses mercury, and the latter an
alloy of gold and silver, for the purpose. Both methods seem susceptible of
considerable accuracy. The Committee have not yet decided which of the two
is preferable ; but their merits have been discussed from a chemical point of
view in the appended Report C, by Prof. Williamson and Dr. Matthiessen.

An interesting letter from Dr. Siemens on the same point will also be found

in the Appendix E. This gentleman there advocates the use of a metre of
mercury of one square millimetre section at 0° C. as the resistance unit ; but his
arguments seem really to bear only on the use of mercury in constructing
and reproducing the standard, and would apply as well to any length and
section as to those which he has chosen.

   When the material 1862 standard has once been made, whether of platinum,

gold and alloy, or mercury, or otherwise, the exact dimensions of a column of
mercury, or of a wire of gold- silver alloy, corresponding to that standard can
be ascertained, published, and used where absolutely necessary for the pur-

pose of reproduction.

   It should at the same time be well understood that, whether this reproduc-
tion does or does not agree with the original standard, the unit is to be that
one original material permanent standard, and no other whatever, and also
that a certified copy will always be infinitely preferable to any reproduction.

   The reproduction by means of a fresh determination of the absolute unit
would never be attempted, inasmuch as it would be costly, difficult, and
uncertain ; but, as already mentioned, the difference between new absolute
                 ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.           131

determinations and the material standard should from time to time be ob-
served and published.

   The question, whether the material standard should aim at an approxima-

tion to the or was much debated. In favour of the latter it
                                                                                                                             ,

was argued that, so long as in England feet and grains were in general use,

the re woidd be anomalous, and would entail complicated reductions in
      second

dynamical calculations. In favour of the       = it was argued that, when

                                          second

new standards were to be established, those should be chosen which might be

generally adopted, and that the metre is gaining universal acceptance.

Moreover the close accordance between Dr. Siemens's unit and the decimal

                 --TH PJ"T*P                                      *

multiple of the               weighed in favour of this unit ; so that the question

                 second

was decided in favour of the metrical system.

In order to carry out the above views, two points of essential importance

had to be determined. First, the degree of accuracy with which the material

standard could at present be made to correspond with the  = ; and

                                                          second

secondly, the degree of permanency which could be ensured in the material
standard when made.

The Committee are, unfortunately, not able yet to form any definite opinion

upon either of these points.

   Eesistance-coils, prepared by Professor W. Thomson, have been sent to

Professor Weber; and ho has, with great kindness, determined their resistance

in electro-magnetic units as accurately as he could. It is probable that his

determinations are very accurate ; nevertheless the Committee did not feel

that they would bo justified in issuing standards based on these determina-

tions alone. In a matter of this importance, the results of no one man could

be accepted without a check. Professor Weber had made some similar deter-

minations with less care some years since, but, unfortunately, he has not pub-

lished the difference, if any, between the results of the two determinations.

Indirect comparisons between the two determinations show a great discre-

pancy, amounting perhaps to 7 per cent. ; but it is only fair to say that this

error may have been due to some error in other steps of the comparison, and

not to Professor Weber's determination. Meanwhile, it was hoped that a

cheek on Weber's last result would by this time have been obtained by an

independent method due to Professor Thomson. Unfortunately, that gentle-

man and Mr. Fleeming Jenkin, who was requested to assist him, have hitherto

been unable to complete their experiments, owing chiefly to their occupation

as jurors at the International Exhibition. The apparatus is, however, now

nearly complete, and it is hoped will before Christmas give the required deter-

minations.

If Professor Weber's results accord within one per cent, with these new

determinations, it is proposed that provisional standards shall be made of
German- silver wire in the usual way, and that they should be at once issued

to all interested in the subject, without waiting for the construction of the

final material standard.

   The construction of this standard may possibly be delayed for some con-
siderable time by the laborious experiments which remain to be made on the
absolute' permanency of various forms and materials. An opinion is very

                                                                       x2

prevalent that the electrical resistances of wires of some, if not all, metals are

far from permanent ; and since these resistances are 'well known to vary as

the wires are more or less annealed, it is quite conceivable that even the

ordinary changes of temperature, or the passage of the electric cm-rent, may

cause such alterations in the molecular condition of the wire as would alter

its resistance. This point is treated at some length in the two Reports;

E and G, appended, by Professor Williamson and Dr. Matthiossen. The ex-

periments hitherto made have not extended over a sufficient time to establish

any very positive results ; but, so far as can be judged at present, some, though

not all, wires do appear to vary in conducting power.

Mercury would be free from the objection that its molecular condition

might change ; but, on the other hand, it appears from Report C that the

mercury itself would require to be continually changed, and that consequently,

even if the tube containing it remained unaltered (a condition which could

not be absolutely ensured), the standards measured at various times would not

Areally be the same standard.      possibility at least of error would thus occur

at each determination, and certainly no two successive determinations would

absolutely agree. If, therefore, wires can be found which are permanent,

they would be preferred to mercury, although, as already said, no conclusion

has been come to on this point.

Some further explanation will now be given of the resolutions passed from

time to time by the Committee, and appended to this Report.

Dr. Matthicssen was requested to make experiments with the view of

determining an alloy with a minimum variation of resistance due to change

of temperature. Tbe object of this research was to find an alloy of which

resistance- coils could be made requiring little or no correction for tempera-

Ature during a series of observations.  preliminary Report on this subject

is appended (A), in which the curious results of Dr. Matthiessen's experiments

on alloys are alluded to, and, in particular, the following fact connected

with the resistance of alloys of two metals is pointed out.

Let us conceive two wires of the two pure metals of equal length, and

containing respectively the relative weights of those two metals to be used in

the alloy. Let us further conceive these two wires connected side by side,

or, as we might say, in multiple arc. Then let the difference be observed

in the resistance of this multiple arc when at zero and 100° Cent. This

difference will be found almost exactly equal in all cases to the difference

which will be observed in the resistance of a wire drawn from the alloy

formed of those two metal wires at zero and 100°, although the actual resist-

ance at both temperatures will in most cases be very much greater than that

of the hypothetical multiple arc.

In order to obtain a minimum percentage of variation with a change of

temperature, it was consequently only necessary to make experiments on

those alloys which offer a veiy high resistance as compared with the mean

resistance of their components. The results of a few experiments are given

in the Report, but these are only the first of a long series to be undertaken.

Hitherto an alloy of platinum and silver is the only one of which the conduct-

ing power and variation with temperature are less than that of German silver.

Professor W. Thomson and Dr. Matthiessen were requested to examine the

Aelectrical permanency of metals and alloys.  preliminary Report on the

subject by Dr. Matthiessen is appended (B), in which he shows that, after

four months, one copper and two silver hard-drawn wires have altered,

becoming more like annealed wires, but that no decided change has yet been

detected in the great majority of the wires.

ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.                               133

   Several eminent practical electricians were requested to advise the Com-

mittee as to the form of coil they considered most suitable for a material
standard, and also to furnish a sample coil such as they could recommend.
Sir Charles Bright informed the Committee that he was ready to comply with
the request. The point is one of considerable importance, respecting which

it was thought that practical men might give much valuable information. Coils
of wire may be injured by damp, acids, oxidation, stretching and other
mechanical alterations. They may be defective from imperfect or uncertain
insulation ; and they may be inconveniently arranged, so that they do not

readily take the temperature of the surrounding medium, or cannot be safely

immersed in water- or oil-baths, as is frequently desirable. No definite con-

clusion as to the form of coil to be recommended, even for copies, has been

arrived at.

    It was resolved " That the following gentlemen should be informed of the
appointment of the present Committee, and should be requested to furnish

suggestions in furtherance of its object :

Professor Ecllund (TJpsala)           Professor Neumann (Konigsberg).

Professor T. Fechner (Leipsic).       Professor J. C. PoggendorfT (Berlin).

Dr. Henry (Washington).               M. Pouillet (Paris).
                                      Werner Siemens, Ph.D. (Berlin).
Professor Jacobi (St. Petersburg).
Professor G. Kirchhoff (Heidelberg).  Professor W. E. Weber (Gbttingen)."

Professor C. Matteucci (Turin).

  A letter, appended to this Report, was consequently addressed to each of

these gentlemen. Answers have been received from Professor Kirchhoff and
Dr. Siemens, which will be found in the Appendix. The resolution arrived

at by the Committee to construct a material standard will entirely meet
Professor Kirchhoffs views. The Committee have been unable entirely to

adopt Dr. Siemens's suggestions ; but his statements as to the accuracy with
which a standard can be reproduced and preserved by mercury will form the
subject of further special investigation, and the Committee will be most happy
to take advantage of his kind offers of assistance.

  A letter was also received from Sir Charles Bright, containing an ingenious

method of maintaining a constant tension or difference of potentials. This

point will probably come before the Committee at a later period, when Sir

Charles Blight's suggestion will not be lost sight of.

   The Committee also received on the 29th of Sept., after the present Report
had been drawn up, a letter from Dr. Essclbach, a well-known electrician,
who had charge of the electrical tests of the Malta and Alexandria Cable
during its submergence. In this letter Dr. Esselbach arrives at substantially
the same conclusions as those recommended by the Committee. Thus, his
first conclusion is "to adopt Weber's absolute unit substantially, and to derive
from it, by the multiple 10 10 , the practical unit." This practical unit is
precisely that recommended by your Committee. Dr. Esselbach uses the

multiple 10 10, starting from the  LII

                                       r!^ where your Committee recommend

Dr. Esselbach's next conclusion is also of great practical value. He points

out that the electro-magnetic unit of electromotive force, also multiplied by
10 10, differs extremely little from the common DanielFs cell, and that, without

doubt, by proper care such a cell could be constructed as would form a

practical unit of electromotive force. This suggestion has the approval of

the Committee. Dr. Esselbach next points out that the unit of resistance
which he proposes differs very little from Dr. Siemens's mercury unit, which
he, like your Committee, considers a great advantage ; and the difference is,

--indeed, less than he supposes. He also proposes to use "Weber's absolute unit

for the unit of current a suggestion entirely in accordance with the fore-
going Report ; and he further points out that this current will be of con-

venient magnitude for practical purposes. He next approves of the sugges-

tions of Sir Charles Bright and Mr. Latimer Clark with reference to nomen-
clature and terminology. In the body of his letter he gives some valuable
data with reference to the unit of quantity, which he defines in the same
manner as your Committee. This result will be analysed in the Report which

Professor W. Thomson and Mr. Heeming Jenkin will make on the fresh de-

termination of the absolute unit of resistance.

   The Committee attach high importance to this communication, showing
as it does that a practical electrician had arrived at many of the very same
conclusions as the Committee, quite independently and without consultation
with any of the members. Dr. Esselbach has omitted to point out, what he
no doubt was well aware of, that, if, as he suggests, two equal multiples of
the absolute units of resistance and electromotive force are adopted, the

practical unit of electromotive force, or Daniell's cell, will, in a circuit of
the practical unit of resistance, produce the unit current.

   Mr. Fleeming Jenkin was requested to furnish an historical summary of

the various standards of resistance, but he has been unable to complete his
Report in time for the present meeting.

    Professor Williamson and Dr. Matthiessen were requested to put together
the facts regarding the composition of the various materials hitherto used for
standards of resistance, and the physical changes they were likely to undergo.
"Wires of pure solid metals, columns of mercury, and wires of alloys have
been used for the purpose. The Report of the above gentlemen is appended
(C). In it they arrive at the following conclusions :

    First, with reference to pure metals in a solid state, they consider that the
preparation of those metals in a state of sufficient purity to ensure a constant
specific resistance is exceedingly difficult, as is proved by the great discre-
pancy in the relative conducting powers obtained by different observers.
Electrotype copper is excepted from this remark. They also point out that
the influence of annealing on the conducting powers of pure solid metals is
very great, and would render their use for the purpose of reproducing a stand-
ard very objectionable, inasmuch as it is impossible to ensure that any two
wires shall be equally hard or soft. They observe that errors of the same
kind might be caused by unseen cavities in the wires, and give examples of
the actual occurrence of these cavities. They point out another objection to
the use of pure solid metals as standards, in the fact that their resistance
varies rapidly with a change of temperature, so that slight errors in a ther-
mometer or its reading would materially affect the results of an experiment.

   Secondly, with reference to mercury, they show that it is comparatively
easily purified, varies little in resistance with a change of temperature, and
can undergo no change analogous to that caused by annealing ; but that, on
the other hand, measurements of its conducting power by different observers
vary much, that the tube used cannot be kept full of mercury for any length
of time, as it would become impure by partial amalgamation with the ter-
minals, and that consequently each time a mercury standard is used it has,
practically, to be remade. The accuracy with which different observers can
reproduce mercury standards has not been determined.
             ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.                        135

    Thirdly, with reference to alloys, they say that there is better evidence of
the independent and accurate reproduction of a standard by a gold-silver
alloy of certain proportions than by a pure solid metal or by mercury. They
point out that annealing and changes of temperature have far less effect on
alloys than on pure metals, and that consequently any want of homogeneity

or any error in observing the temperature dimng an experiment is, with

alloys, of little consequence, but that, on the other hand, the existence of
cavities must be admitted as possible in all solid wires. They are of opinion
that the permanence of jewellery affords strong ground for believing that a
gold-silver alloy will be quite as permanent as any solid pure metal ; and in
the course of the Report they point out some curious facts showing that a

great change in the molecular condition of some pure metals and alloys may

occur without any proportional change in their conducting powers.
   Finally, they recommend that practical experiments should be made inde-

pendently by several gentlemen to determine whether mercury or the gold-
silver alloy be really the better means of reproducing a standard.

   The main resolution arrived at by the Committee, viz. that a material
standard shall be adopted which at the temperature of 17° Cent, shall approxi-

mate to 107  TV) f*T T"f*

                           , as far as present data allow, has been already fully

explained. It was not arrived at until after several meetings had been held

and the merits of the various proposals fully discussed.

This resolution was passed (unanimously) at a meeting when five out of

the six members of the Committee were present.

It was at the same time resolved that provisional copies should be distri-

buted at the present Meeting; but the circumstances have been already

explained which have prevented this resolution from being carriedjnto effect.

It was thought desirable that an apparatus should be designed which could

be recommended by the Committee for use in copying and multiplying the

units to be issued, since it is certain that some of the glaring discrepancies

in coils intended to agree must have been due to defective modes of adjust-

ment. Mr. Fleeming Jenkin has consequently designed an apparatus for the

purpose, of which a description is appended. Messrs. Elliott Brothers have

kindly constructed a couple of these instruments, which were seen in action,

at the Meeting of the Association, by members interested in this subject.

The present Report was drawn up by Mr. Jenkin, and adopted at a

meeting of the Committee on the 30th of September.

  ArrENDix A. On the Variation of the Electrical Resistance of Alloys clue to
               Change of Temperature. By Dr. Matthiessex, F.R.S.

    It has been shown* that the influence of temperature on the electric conduct-
 ing power of the metals amounts to 29-3 per cent, on their conducting power
 between 0° and 100° C. : an exception to this law has been found in ironf, the
 conducting power of which decreases between those limits 38-2 per cent. It
 was, therefore, useless to try any of the other pure metals, as they would, in all
 probability, have decreased by the same amount, as well as from the fact that
 the metals which would have suited the purpose had already been tried. I

 therefore turned my attention to the alloys, and, in conjunction with Dr. C.

 V~ogt, have made a long series of experiments respecting the influence of

 temperature on their electric conducting power. After having determined
 the conducting power of a few of them at different temperatures, together

 with the help of the few experiments which have already been made by
 different observers, it became obvious that the percentage decrement in
their conducting power stands in some relation to the fact that, when a solid
metal is alloyed with another (with the exception of lead, tin, zinc, and
cadmium amongst each other), a lower conducting power is observed than the
mean of that of the components %. The law which we found to regulate
 this property was with most alloys the following, viz. :

    " The percentage decrement between 0° and 100° in the conducting power of
an alloy in a solid state stands in the same ratio to the mean percentage
decrement of the components between 0° and 100° as the conducting power of
the alloy at 100° does to the mean conducting power of the components at 100° ;"
or, in other words, " the absolute difference in the observed, resistance between 0°
and 100° of an alloy is equal to the absolute difference between the means of
the resistance of the component metals between 0° and 100°."

    For example, the conducting power of the hard-drawn gold-silver alloy
was found equal to 15-03 at 0° (taking silver equal 100° at 0°), and de-
creases 6-49 per cent, between 0° and 100°. The mean decrement of the
components between 0° and 100° being 29-3 per cent., the conducting power
of the alloy is 14-05 at 100°, and that of the mean of the components is 62-58

at 100°. If we now calculate the percentage decrement in the conducting
power of the alloy between 0° and 100° from the above data, we find it equal

to 0-58 per cent., and by experiments it was found equal to 6-49 per cent.

=Or, taking the resistance of silver at 0° 100, and that of gold at 0°= 128-3,

we find the resistance of the alloy at 0°=6G5-3, and at 100°=711-7, and
that calculated from a mean of the volumes of its components at 0°= 113-2,

and at 100°=159-8 ; therefore the absolute difference between the observed
resistance at 0° and 100° is 46-4, and that between the calculated at 0° and
100°=46-8.

   Knowing already, from my experiments on the electric conducting power

of alloys§, that when two metals are alloyed together in any proportion, if the

alloy is merely a solution of the two metals in one another, its conducting

power may be approximatively foretold, and that, from the above law, it is

necessary that if the conducting power of an alloy should vary between the

limits of 0° and 100° to a minimum extent, the alloy itself must have a
minimum conducting power as compared with that calculated from its

--components, I at once foresaw that it would be useless, as was afterwards

proved by the research made in conjunction with Dr. Yogt, to make any
 experiments with the two metal-alloys, which may be looked upon as a
 solution of one metal in the other, as no j>ractical alloy would be found
which woidd vary in its conducting power between 0° and 100° to a small
extent. It must also be borne in mind that the alloy sought for must be a
 ductile one, capable of being drawn into wire, not too soft, as would
easily be damaged by covering and winding, easily produced, and cheap in
price. Bearing this in mind, wo turned our attention to some three metal-
alloys, thinking that we had some chance there of obtaining a good result
for it is well known that the conducting power of German-silver wire varies
in such a slight extent between 0° and 100°.

    It also appeared worth while to experiment with some of those alloys

which may perhaps be considered chemical combinations, or to contain such,

as, for instance, platinum and silver ; and, on account of their other physical
properties, the platinum-iridium alloys were also experimented with.

    In the following Table I give the results obtained in conjunction with Dr.
Vogt. The unit here taken for comparison is that of a hard-drawn silver
wire at 0°. The normal wires were made of German silver, and in order
to obtain their values in terms of hard-drawn silver, they were compared
with the gold-silver alloy. In these experiments it was thought better
first to use those pure metals which are easily obtained, so as to learn some-
thing regarding the manner in which the three metal- alloys behave, and
then try some alloys made of the cheaper commercial metals. As will be seen
by the Table, only the first part has been as yet carried out.

   The method and apparatus employed for the above determinations, together
with the precautions taken to ensure correct residts, have already been

described^. We have made only three observations between 0° and 100°,

for it was found that they gave almost exactly the same formulae for the
correction of the conducting power for temperature as if we had taken seven
or more observations between 0° and 100°. Each of the above values for the
conducting power, at those temperatures, is the mean of three or more
observations. It was easy to obtain the desired temperatures as a mean of
several observations, after veiy little practice. I have no doubt that, in the
course of our experiments, we shall be able to find an alloy, the conducting
power of which will decrease between 0° and 100° even less than that of silver-
platinum. The experiments are being continued, and I hope, before the next
meeting of the Association, to be able to lay before you results which will
throw more light on the subject, as well as to propose an alloy with a
minimum variation in its conducting power due to change of temperature,

which may be made commercially in a cheap manner of the common com-

mercial metals, and possessing those properties which are essential that it

should have.

Appendix B. On the Electrical Permanency of Metals and Alloys.

                     By Dr. Matthxessen, F.B.S.

   Having, in conjunction with Prof. Thomson, been requested by your Com-
mittee to make some experiments on this subject, we thought it advisable for
one of us to undertake some preliminary experiments in which all possible
disturbing causes were isolated. The chief of these are, oxidation by the
oxygen of the air, as well as by acids produced by the oxidation of the oil
or grease with which a wire is almost always covered when drawn, as the

holes in the draw-plates are generally oiled or greased ; stretching during the

process of covering and winding ; and after being wound on the bobbin, elon-
gation by expansion or contraction, owing to variations of temperature, &c.

--These, I think, have been obviated in the following manner : The wires were

carefully wound round a glass tube in order to bring them into a smaller
compass, and after taking them off, they were placed inside wide glass tubes,
and soldered to two thick copper wires, these having been previously passed
through corks which fitted into the ends of the glass tube ; through each of
the corks a small glass tube passed, drawn out in the middle to enable it to be

drawn off easily, and sealed hermetically by a lamp. The wire being soldered
to the thick copper connectors, and the corks fitted into the tube, dry carbonic-
acid gas was led through it for the space of about six hours, for the purpose

of drying it perfectly, as well as of displacing the air contained in it ; after

which the small glass tubes were melted off at the points, when they hare
been previously drawn out. Tin caps, filled with melted marine glue, were

then fitted over the corks and the ends of the tube, to prevent diffusion of the
carbonic acid and air through the corks. The whole of the tin caps outside, as
well as those parts of the copper- wire connectors which dipped in water of
the bath in which they were placed whilst being tested, were covered with a
thick coating of marine glue.

   The wires experimented with were as follows :

                                                                                                                                     ;

                                         rest were compared.

   The reason why duplicates were made in each case was that, in case any of

them should by any cause get damaged, the experiments might be continued

with the duplicate. When being tested, they were placed in a large bath

containing from 40 to 50 litres of water. By testing the wires at 20° it was

found easy to keep that temperature in tho bath, diuing the experiments, to
0-1° or 0-2°.

   Up to the present time, that is to say, four months since they were first

tested, the conducting power of the wires 1, 3, and 5 has altered, owing to

becoming, in all probability, partially annealed. "Wire 8 has also altered mate-

rially, having decreased in conducting power 3-5 per cent. : this decrement may

be possibly due to bad soldering. The differences found with the other wires
are so very small, that it is impossible to say whether they have altered or not
for 04° or 0-2° will account for them. It was, therefore, thought better to wait
for another two or four months before giving an opinion as to whether they alter
or not ; for as the wires are in tubes and only surrounded by carbonic acid, we
can never be absolutely sure that the wire has exactly the same temperature
as the bath, more especially when it is considered that each time the con-
nexion with the battery is made the wire becomes somewhat heated.

    If, two or four months hence, they still show no difference in their con-
ducting powers, it is proposed to expose the one set to variations of tempera-

ture such as may occur (for instance, from 0° to 40°), and then, should no
change occur in then- conducting powers, to lead a weak current through
them, say, for a month ; for it has been asserted that a cm-rent passing

through wire causes a permanent change in its conducting power.

   If after these experiments the conducting power of the wires remains un-
altered, the different forms of resistance-coils, made from those wires, which
have shown themselves permanent will then be tested in order to prove
which is the best form of coil for the British Association unit.

C--Appendix  On the Beproduetion of Electrical Standards ly Chemical Means.

By Professor "Williamson, F.R.S., and Dr. Matthtessen, F.B.S.

   In the following Report we have discussed, more especially from a chemical

point of view, the relative merits of the different propositions which have
been made to reproduce standards of electric resistance, and have treated them
under three heads :

   I. Those reproduced ly a given length and section or weight, at a given
           temperature, of a pure metal in a solid state.

 II. Those reproduced hy a given length and section or weight, at a given
           temperature, of a pare metal in a liquid state.

III. Those reproduced hy a given length and section or weight, at a given
           tenipercrfure, of an cdloy.

The points on which we shall speak will be

   1. On their p>reparation in a state ofpurity.
   2. On their homogeneity and their molecular condition.
   3. On the effect of annealing on their conducting power.
   4. On the influence of temperature on their conducting power.

I. Those reproduced ly a given length and section or weight, at a given
                    temperature, of a pure metal in a solid state.

 _ As type of this class we have chosen copper, for it has been more exten-

sively used as unit of electric resistance, both by scientific as well as by
practical men, than any other metal or alloy ; but what we are about to say
regarding copper will hold good in almost every case for all pure metals in a

solid state.

   1. On its preparation in a state of purity.--As traces of foreign metals

materially affect the conducting power of most pure metals, it is of the utmost
importance that those used for the reproduction of units of electric resistance

should be absolutely chemically pure. The difficulty in obtaining absolutely
pure metals even by chemists is very great. Thus, for instance, Becquerel*
found the conducting power of pure gold at 0° equal to 68-9, compared with

that of pure silver at 0° equal to 100 ; whereas, under the same circumstance,

Matthiessen and von Bosef found it equal to 77-9,--showing a difference of
about 12 per cent, in the values observed for the conducting power of gold,

prepared pure by different chemists. This difference may be due to the silver

not being pure, or to all of them being more or less pure. Now when we

consider that these standards are required by electricians and other physicists
who have little or no acquaintance with chemical manipulation, and that
the cost of the preparation of absolutely pure metals by scientific chemists
would be very expensive on account of the time and trouble they require,
we think that this fact alone constitutes a very serious drawback to their use

as a means for the reproduction of standards of electric resistance. From
the experience which one of us has had on this subject, it is more than pro-
bable that if pure metals be prepared by different chemists in the ordinary
way of business, variations in their conducting power would be found equal
to several per cent. Thus, copper supplied as pure by a well-known assayer

had a conducting power equal to 92, whereas pure copper conducts at the
same temperature 100*. Again, the pure gold of the assayer conducts oidy
65-5, whereas pure gold at the same temperature would have a conducting
power equal to 73 f. In order to show that the conducting power of com-

mercial metals varies to a great extent, we give in the following Table (X.)
the values found for that of the different coppers of commerce ; and it will be

evident from it,. that to take a given length and weight or section of a com-
mercial metal as unit, as has often been done, is very wrong, and can only

lead to great discrepancies between the results of different observers.

   Similar variations will be found with most other metals, and we shall give

examples of these further on.

 --2. On its homogeneity and ite molecular condition. It is well known that

the wires of some metais require much more care in drawing than in others

thus, copper and silver, if not annealed often enough during the process of
drawing, will often become quite brittle, and break off short when bent.
Now, if the fracture be closely observed, it will be seen that the wire is hol-
low ; in fact, wherever it is broken, cavities will be found, and sometimes of

a miDimetre or two in length ; so that such a wire may almost be regarded

as a tube with a veiy fine bore. The reason of this is simply that in not an-
nealing the wire often enough, the internal part of it becomes hard and brit-
tle, whilst the outside remains annealed, from the heat evolved by its passage

through the holes of the draw-plates ; after a time, however, the inside, being
very brittle, will give way, whilst the outside is still strong enough to bear
the force used in drawing it through the draw-plates. These places in the
wires are easily discovered on drawing the wire finer ; for then at these points

the wire slightly collapses, owing to the quicker elongation of the weak points
by the force used in drawing. Silver and cojmer are the only metals which
have been experimented with in this manner ; we are therefore unable to say
whether it may occur with the other metals. However, although no such wires
could be used for experiments, yet what has been shown possible to occur to
such a marked extent when purposely trying to obtain such results, may occur

to some slight extent, especially when great care is not used, and when the

wires are drawn by different persons. This may explain why, with some metals

and alloys of the same preparation, conducting powers are often obtained

which vary several per cent. For instance, W. Thomson* found the conduct-

ing power of several alloys of copper which he had had made and tested to

alter considerably on being drawn finer ; some of them were faulty from the

cause we have just mentioned, and, on their being drawn finer, these places

showed themselves, and were then cut away.

It has also been shownf that when copper wire is heated to 100° for seve-

ral days, a permanent alteration takes place in its conducting power : thus,

with the first wire experimented on, it increased almost to the same extent

as if it had been annealed. With the second wire the increment was not

nearly so large as with the first, and with the third it hardly altered at all.

That this is not due to one or the other of the wires being faulty in the just-

mentioned manner is proved,

1st, By the close agreement in the conducting powers.

2nd, By the close agreement between the differences in the values found

for the conducting powers of the hard-drawn and annealed wires. They

      Annealed               101-8                    102-1      102-2

   The values given for the hard-drawn wires are those which were observed
before the wire was heated at all.

   3rd, That the same occurs with pressed wires : thus, with bismuth it was
found that the pieces of the same wire behaved differently ; wire 1 showing,
after 1 day's heating to 100°, an increment in the conducting power of 16
per cent., whereas wire 2 increased, although a piece from the same length of
wire, 9 per cent.

   Again, take the case of tellurium, and taking the conducting power of each

bar at first equal to 100, we find that the conducting power of bar 1 had

decreased after 13 days' heating to 4, where it then remained constant, that
of bar 2 after 32 days became constant at 19, and that of bar 3 after 33 days

at 6.

   The cause of these marked changes in the conducting power must therefore
be looked for in the molecular arrangement of the wires or bars employed. In

the case of copper, they may be, and probably are, due to the partial annealing
of the wires ; for we find that wire 1, although the conducting power increased

after having been kept at 100° for several days almost to the same extent as
if it had been annealed, yet, on annealing it, it only gained as follows (the
results obtained with wires 2 and 3 are added) :

   The above shows tbat, in all probability, the annealing plays here a part,

but not the whole, in the change ; for otherwise why do the wires behave dif-

ferently ? This point will be fully discussed in another Report which will be
laid before your Committee, and in which it will be shown where the hard-
drawn wires become partially annealed, and annealed wires partially hard-
drawn, by age.

    It is a curious fact that a change in the molecular arrangement of the

particles of wire of some metals which may be considered homogeneous has

very little effect on its electric conducting power. Thus pure cadmium*,
which when cold is exceedingly ductile, becomes quite brittle and crystal-
line at about 80°, and returns again to its ductile condition on cooling, shows
no marked change in its conducting power at that temperature ; in fact, it
behaves as if no such change had taken place. Again, when iron wire is heated
in a current of ammonia it becomes perfectly brittle and crystalline, without
altering its conducting power to any marked extent.

    That a wire which changes its molecular condition in becoming crystalline

does not necessarily materially alter in its conducting power, is an important
as well as a veiy interesting point, and has also been proved in the case

of German silver.

 --3. On the effect of annealing on the conducting power. When hard-drawn

wires of silver, copper, gold, &c, are heated to redness and cooled slowly,
they become much softer, and on testing their conducting powers they will

be found to have increased thus :

Now there  is a   certain                       difficulty in drawing        a wire which  is  hard-drawn
                                                                                                                                          ;

and if annealed wires be used for the reproduction of standards, the molecular

condition, or perhaps the process of annealing, has an influence on the incre-

ment of the conducting power. Thus, according to Siemens [, the difference

in the conducting power between hard-drawn and annealed silver varies be-

--tween 12-6 and 8 per cent., and that of copper between 6 and 0-5 per cent.

according to Matthiessen and von Bose^f, that of silver varies between 10

and 6 per cent., and that of copper between 2-6 and 2 per cent.

Again, the annealed wires of pure metals arc so soft that they would easily

get damaged in covering them with silk or winding them on the bobbins, so

that in using them the utmost care would have to be employed in order to

prevent their getting injured.

 --4. On the influence of temperature on the electric conducting power. It has

been shown that the conducting power of most pure metals decreases,

between 0° and 100°, 29-3 per cent. : pure iron has been found to form an

exception to this law, its conducting power decreasing between those tempera-

tures 38-2 per cent. If pure metals be therefore used as standards, very

accurate thermometers are necessary, as an error of 0-1° in comparing

two standards would cause an error in the resistance of about 0-04 per cent.

Now there is great difficulty in obtaining normal thermometers ; and we must

bear in mind that supposing the zero-point of the thermometer is correct to-
day, we are not at all justified in assuming that it will be so in six months
time ; so that we ought to redetermine the zero-point of the thermometer be-
fore using it for the above purpose. Again, it has been proved that the in-
fluence of temperature on the conducting power of wires of the same metal is
not always the same*. Thus, for the conducting power of annealed copper
wires the following values were found :

                                                         o

These values agree together as well as might be expected, considering that

Now0-01 per cent, impurity would cause these differences.  the values-

obtained by different observers vary between the numbers 59 and 78.

If we now take the case of copper, the values found by the same experi-

menters* for different preparations of the pure hard- drawn metal were

  99-9 at 0°  99-4 at 0°              99-8 at 0°

They were drawn by themselves, and all, with one exception, electrotype

copper.

   It is well known how differently the so-called pure copper conducts when

prepared by different experimenters. In the following Table, in order to
show these facts more clearly, we have given the conducting powers of the
metals, taking that of silver equal 100 at 0°. Silver, copper, gold, and pla-
tinum were hard-drawn. All values given, except where the contrary is

mentioned, have been reduced to 0°.

as unit. These facts therefore seem to indicate that mercury is not yet
proved to be a safe means of reproducing standards of electric resistance.

   The influence of temperature on the conducting power of mercury, between
0° and 100°, is, comparatively speaking, small, being only 8-3 per cent.,
whereas that of the metals in a solid state decreases between those limits

29-3 per cent. This property would, of course, render the use of very accurate
thermometers unnecessary ; for 1° would only cause a difference in the con-
ducting power of about 0-08 per cent., and therefore 0-1 only 0-008 per cent.,
so that an error of 1 or 2 tenths of a degree might almost be overlooked.

  A fact has just come to our knowledge through Mr. Jenkin. He informs

us that, having to make a report on the electric apparatus in the International

Exhibition, he tested, amongst other things, several resistance-coils. Now he

found two sets of coils made by the same firm, the one exhibited in the Prus-
sian, the other in the English department. Both were said to be multiples
of the mercury unit proposed by Siemens*, and their resistances determined
by comparing a coil in each set with that of a tube filled with mercury.
Taking each set by itself and comparing the coils in it with one another in
the proper combination, they were found to be perfect ; in fact, the adjust-
ment of them was perfectly accurate. When, however, Mr. Jenkin compared
coils of the two sets with each other, instead of being equal, they were found
to show a difference of 1-2 per eent.t

 III. On those reproduced by a given length and section or weight, at a given
                                       temperature, of an alloy.

   The alloy on which we have to speak is that composed of two parts by
weight of gold and one of silver. The reason why this alloy was proposed
is that the use of (say) 1 per cent, more or less gold does not materially alter

--its conducting power.
   1. On its preparation. It has been shown that the alloy may be made of
commercially pure metals and have the same conducting power as that made
from chemically pure ones ; for the maximum differences in the conducting
power between those made in different parts of the world are not greater

than those of a pure metal, either in a solid or liquid state, prepared by

the same experimenter. But it may be urged that part of the differences

obtained by different observers is due to the different methods employed in

determining their conducting powers, and therefore had the conducting

power of these alloys being determined by different persons, much greater
differences would have been found. In answer to this, we give, in the fol-
lowing Table, the determination of the conducting power of several alloys by
Thomson and Matthiessen J, independently of one another. The alloys were
made by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey.

The differences here, with the exception of alloy 6 and copper 2, may be
due to the temperature at which the observations were made not being in
both cases the same ; for 2 or 3 degrees' difference will account for them.
The Table, however, shows that different observers do obtain the same values

for the conducting power of the same wires.
   The values obtained for the conducting power of the gold-silver alloy,

made by different persons, of different gold and silver, are given in the fol-

lowing Table-

                                Alloy.

that care was taken to have the alloy drawn by different persons, in order to

see if this would influence the results obtained with them, as well as to ascer-

tain whether the wires would show the same faults as silver and copper does
when not carefully drawn. It has been argued that the molecular condition

of all alloys is liable to undergo a change by age, and that, therefore, alloys

are not fit to be used as standards. Thus, it is well known that brass and
German silver become brittle and crystalline by age, and that the same may

occur with the gold-silver alloy ; but on looking at the composition of the

alloy, it will be found to have nearly the same as that of the gold chains of

commerce. Now, we do not know of a single instance where such a

chain, even after years of use, becomes brittle or crystalline ; so that we

think it more than possible that the alloy will not change its molecular

condition by age. It must also be remembered that even when German sil-

ver becomes brittle, it does not materially alter in its conducting power. The
same has already been proved, and mentioned in this Report, to be the case
with iron and cadmium.

 --3. On the effect of annealing on the conducting power of the alloy. When

the alloy is heated to redness and cooled slowly, its conducting power was

--found to have increased only 0-3 per cent. this value being the mean of
--eight wires annealed in different ways, proving, therefore, that if the wires

may be only partially hard-drawn, it will make but little difference in the

conducting power.

 --4. On the influence of temperature on the conducting power of the alloy.

When wires of this alloy are heated from 0° to 100°, a decrement in the con-

ducting power, amounting to 6-5 per cent., will be found. The same argu-
ments may, therefore, be put forward in favour of the use of the alloy as a
standard, as were done in the case of mercury when speaking of this pro-

perty.

   To sum up, therefore, the arguments in favour of and against the use of
the three propositions made to reproduce standards of electric resistance, we

find in favour of a pure metal in a solid state :

   1. That it appears that all descriptions of electrotype copper, when carefully
drawn, have the same conducting power.

Against it :

    1. That their preparation, with the exception of the electrotype copper in
a state of purity, is exceedingly difficult ; so that independent persons pre-
paring the same metal find, on comparing the conducting powers obtained
for them, that they vary several per cent.

2. That the influence of annealing on their conducting powers is so great

that differences may occur simply because the wires are partially hard-drawn.

3. That the influence of temperature on their conducting power is very

great                       so  that slight errors  in thermometers, or  in the reading of  them off,
                         ;

would materially affect the result.

   In favour of using mercury as a means of reproducing standards the fol-

lowing may be said :

    1. That no molecular change can take place in the metal, nor can any

alteration occur in its conducting power, on account of annealing ; for its tem-
per is always the same.

   2. That the influence of temperature has only a small effect upon its con-
ducting power.

And against it :

    1. That there is a difficulty in obtaining absolutely pure mercury; bo that
the results obtained by different observers show great variations.
----

150 REPORT--1862.

   2. That the standard tube cannot be kept full of mercury for any length
of time, owing to the diffusion of impure metal, arising from the amalgamated
terminals into the narrow tube ; so that each time the standard has to be

used, it must practically be remade.

    3. If the tube be broken during the process of cleaning or otherwise, it is

not yet certain with what exactitude the standard could be reproduced.
   4. It is doubtful whether the resistance of a tube filled with mercury

today will have the same resistance if filled a year hence ; for we have no

proof if the dimensions of the tube will not alter by being kept. It is well

known that the bulbs of thermometers are liable to change, and are conti-

nually changing, in capacity.

   In favour of the gold-silver alloy may be said :
   1. That this material, when prepared and drawn by different persons, was

found not to vary in its conducting power more than 1-6 per cent. ; whereas
the variations found with the metals in a solid state, prepared and drawn by
different persons, amounts to several per cent., and those found for mercury by

different observers amount also in all cases to several per cent.
   2. That the homogeneity and molecular corfdition of this alloy are always

the same.
   3. That the effect of annealing on the conducting power is very small,

being only 0-3 per cent. ; so that if a wire be partially hard-drawn, its con-

ducting power will not suffer to any appreciable extent.
   4. That the influence of temperature on its conducting power between

0° and 100°, viz. a reduction of 6-5 per cent., is smaller than either that of
the metals in a solid state, viz. 29-3 per cent., or that of mercury, vk. 8-3

per cent.

   And against it :
   That the conducting power may alter by age, as the physical properties of

alloys are more likely to change than those of metals.
   From the foregoing statements, based on facts at present known, it would

appear that the best method of reproducing standards, for those who are un-

able to procure copies of the British Association unit of electrical resistance,

is that they should make, or have made, a certain amount of the gold-silver

alloy (as described in the Phil. Mag., Feb. 1861), by two or three different

persons, in order to ensure a correct result, and take a given length and sec-

tion or weight of it, at a given temperature, which has been found equal in

Weresistance to the British Association unit.  would recommend, in order

further to test what we have stated in the foregoing Report, that three or more

scientific men and electricians be requested to compare the resistances of pure

mercury, obtained by them from the best sources they are able, and of the

gold-silver alloy (made in the manner described in the Phil. Mag.) with a

German-silver standard supplied to them by your Committee. If this be

done, results would be obtained which would put an end to many disputes

on the subject, as well as decide which of the above means is practically the

best for reproducing standards of electrical resistance where no copies of the

British Association unit can be obtained.

introduction of one unit of electrical resistance. I gladly respond to the

invitation to express my view on the manner in which the desired object

might be best attained.
    To define the unit of resistance by the resistance of a wire of given

dimensions of a pure metal appears to me impossible, for the reasons which

have been urged by the Committee ; hence, of the three proposals discussed
by the Committee, there only remain two for our consideration.

    1. To adopt the unit proposed by "Weber ; or, 2. To establish, as unit of
resistance, the resistance of a column of pure mercury of given dimensions

and at a given temperature.

    I do not think that to these a third of equal value can be added ; for to
define the unit of resistance by the thermal action of an electrical current

would certainly never answer the purpose, because this thermal action

cannot be measured with the necessary accuracy, and the resistance of any
wire which is to be permanently kept cannot be fixed as unit ; for the

resistance of any wire for a given temperature certainly undergoes changes if
electrical currents are transmitted through it, and it is exposed to fluctuations

of temperature.

    Of the above two units, the first recommends itself by coming up more
satisfactorily to the demands of science ; the second, as I think, by being
capable for the present of being practically carried out with greater accuracy.
But is it really necessary to decide for one and against the other of these two
units ? I think not. If the ratio between them is established with the accu-
racy which is now attainable, there can, I think, arise no more confusion from
their simultaneous use, than from the practice of expressing lengths sometimes

in metres and sometimes in millimetres. You say, " It is proposed that the

unit adopted shall be represented by one particular standard, constructed of
very permanent materials, laid up in a national repository;" and further,
" The Committee will probably endeavour to devise some plan by which

copies of the actual material standard adopted may be easily procured at a

reasonable cost." This plan, the execution of which I consider highly

desirable, might evidently be realized in all its essential points without its
being necessary to give the preference to one of these units over the other
it would only be necessary to measure the resistance of the normal standard
in both units, and to add to each copy its resistance expressed in both units.

    In choosing the metal or the alloy of which the normal standard and the
copies are to be made, care must undoubtedly Jirst be taken that the
resistance is as unalterable as possible for one temperature. It is undoubtedly
desirable that the resistance shall not vary rapidly with the temperature.
This is, however, not very important, provided that the temperature of the
wire can be accurately observed at any moment. To satisfy this condition,
the wires must not be coiled upon cylinders, but fastened so that, for the
greater part of their extent, they He clear, and hence rapidly assume the
temperature of the surrounding air or of the non-conducting liquid in which

they may have been immersed.
   You request me to point out to you any researches of mine which refer to

a unit of electrical resistance. I have to mention a short treatise only, which
appeared in vol. lxxvi. of PoggendorfPs ' Annalen,' under the title " Deter-
mination of the Constants on which the Intensity of Induced Electrical Currents
depends," and which formed the answer to an academical prize-question which
Professor Neumann, in Konigsberg, had proposed in the year 1846. In thig
treatise a unit of electrical resistance has not been suggested ; but in it the
resistance of a wire has been measured by the unit (or rather by double the
--152 report 1862.

unit), which was afterwards proposed by Weber in his " Electrodynamic
Measurements." Professor Weber has subsequently had the kindness to
compare the copper wire whose resistance I measured, with those whose
resistances he himself had determined (Pogg. Ann. vol. lxxxii. p. 360) ; he

thereby found the resistance of my wire about one-seventh greater than I had

found it. The reason of this want of agreement consists partly in the im-
perfection of the instruments which I had used, and partly in the fact that

in my experiments the temperature was little above 0° R., while in Weber's

experiments it was about 20° R.

   Allow me, my dear Sir, to record the very great respect with which I have

the honour to be,

-- --Appendix E. Dr. Slemens's Letter. Suggestions for the adoption of a

           Common Unit in measurement of Electrical Resistance.

To the Committee appointed by the British Association to report on Standards

                                              of Electrical Resistance.

 --Gentlemen, I beg to acknowledge, with thanks, the honour you have done

me, in requesting me to furnish you with suggestions in furtherance of your
endeavours to procure the adoption of a common unit of electrical resistance.

   I proposed in Poggendorffs Annalen (vol. ex. p. 1) to supply this want by
the adoption of the conducting power of mercury as unit, and of the resist-
ance which a prism of that metal a metre long, and a square millimetre
section, at 0° C, opposes to the passage of a current, as unit of resistance.

   The method by which I constructed standards in this unit was as follows :
   From the ordinary glass tubes of commerce, pieces were selected whose
calibre was found to vary most regularly. After the selected tubes had

--been ground to the length of a metre, they were carefully cleaned and filled

with pure mercury the temperature being measured. The contents were
then weighed, and the values reduced to 0° C. for expansion of glass and
metal. The resistances of the tubes were calculated by the formula

                                          _1

                 W=JjL 1 + Va+ Va,

                       g' 3

which represents the resistance to a current in the longer axis of a prismatic

conductor either in the above unit or in 0-001 unit, according as I is ex-

pressed in metres and g in grammes, or I in millimetres and g in milligrammes

a is the ratio of the greatest to the least transverse section of the tube.

 WAll the data therefore necessary for the value of are exact measures of

length and weight. Measurements of the same tube, at different times, gave
results corresponding within 0-01 per cent, with each other.

   The first objection which is raised against the adoption of mercury as unit,
" that the tubes cannot be made of uniform or similar wires, and that the

standard once broken is lost for ever," is clearly untenable, since the tubes
are not required to be uniform, and the breakage of the standard involves

only the necessity of anew tube, and the determinations of length and weight
anew, to put the operator in possession of a new standard, whose agreement
with the broken one will depend solely on his own handiness in manipulating.

Every standard, of whatever material, is liable to injury ; but the breakage of
a glass is infinitely to be preferred to the treacherous results of a bruised

wire.

    Mercury is, of all metals, that which is best suited to supply a reproducible

standard.

    In the first place, it is procurable pure in sufficient quantities. I heated
for some hours samples of commercial mercury under sulphuric acid con-
taining a few drops of nitric acid, and found their conducting powers after-
wards to be precisely the same as that of a quantity of chemically pure mer-
cury reduced from the oxide.

    Secondly, mercury has always the same molecular structure, and has there-
fore, at the same temperature, always the same resistance.

   From these two grounds it is possible to couple with this unit a geome-

trical conception which is indispensable in practice.
    Thirdly, of all metals capable of being used for resistances, mercury has the

lowest conducting power ; and of all pure metals capable of the same applica-
tion, its resistance varies least with variations of temperature.

    Having formed such original standards, it only remained to copy them in
a convenient form for employment in practice. This I have done,

    1 In raercury contained in glass spirals, and
    2. In German-silver wire.
    The resistance-bridge which I made use of in these measurements, with a

reflecting galvanometer in its circuit, enabled me to attain a precision of

within 0-01 per cent.

    The mercury spirals, as may be seen by the accompanying drawing*, are

provided with cups at their ends, for convenience of filling and for receiving

the contacts of the measuring apparatus. They are either of known resist-
ances, approximating only to a multiple of the unit, or may be adjusted to
 an exact multiple by boring out one of the ends of the tube, which, in this
 case, must stand up half an inch inside the cup. The resistances of the bridge
 must then be arranged so that no current passes through the instrument only

when the desired resistance in the fourth side is reached. When the spiral

 is filled, a vulcanized india-rubber ring is put round the cups, and the spiral
 is suspended in a vessel of ice-water or water kept in circulation by passing
 a current of air through it, and the temperature measured by a delicate
 thermometer.

    The electrical value of each spiral which I have made has been determined
 by comparing it with at least two of the straight normal tubes, both being
 kept during the measurement in ice-water. The greatest differences which
 I have found between such determinations do not exceed 05 per cent., to
 which limit the copies may be trusted.

     In answer to the objection that an admixture takes place between the
 mercury and the solid metal used for the terminals, I must remark that I
 have found this occasion really less inconvenience than is generally believed.
 I kept the copper connexions immersed in the mercury a whole week, but
 could not perceive the slightest decrease in its resistance. Platinum elec-

--154 report 1862.

trodes of considerable surface might be employed ; but I believe that the
removal of the copper connexions after each test, and the removal of the old
mercury from their surfaces before using them again, are a sufficient safeguard
against error arising from this source. Besides, it is easy to fill the spiral
with fresh mercury whenever it is suspected to have dissolved any quantity

of copper, or even on every occasion when a measurement with it is to be
made. Nor -does mercury change its resistance in the least by standing in
the air. This I have proved by keeping a spiral six months filled without

changing the mercury, and found its resistance to be constant.
   The material which I have extensively employed in copying this measure,

viz. German silver, may be classed under the same head as the expensive

gold- silver alloy of Dr. A. Matthiessen, over which it has, however, the con-
siderable advantages of a greater specific resistance, and that its resistance
varies less with temperature variations.

   As a preventive against alteration of resistance by the influence of the air,
I have usually had the resistances made of this metal covered with a coating
of silk and lac.

   Intermediate between the resistances to be measured and the measure
itself, I have introduced resistance-scales. These contain each a series of
resistances (multiples of the unit), and are so arranged that each resistance is

exact when it stands stopped alone in the circuit. When carefully made, these
scales may be depended on to 0-1 per cent.

   Being convinced of the sufficiency of the method I have described of repro-
ducing a standard of electrical resistance, I have the honour to suggest to you,

   1st. To recommend the universal adoption of the conducting power of
mercury as unit, and of the resistance which a prism of that metal, a metre
long, and square milhmetre section, at 0° C, opposes to a current of electri-
city as common unit of resistance.

   2nd. To have the value of this measure ascertained, with the greatest pos-

sible exactness, in absolute units.

   3rd. To have copies of this unit constructed in mercury contained in glass

spirals for preservation in scientific repositories.

   In the event of my suggestions being adopted, the mercury unit should be

determined again with the greatest possible care, and with all the help which
pure and applied science offers, and copies of it made with equal exactness.

    According to a late determination by Weber, the mercury unit is only about

2| per cent, greater than 10 10 absolute units, or one mercury unit at-- 26° C.

would equal 10,000,000,000 absolute units.
    Since those cases in which the expression of resistances in absolute measure

is of advantage in facilitating calculations occur only very seldom, and only
in purely scientific exercises, a single determination of the relation of the two
measures would be amply sufficient. Should the absolute unit or any mul-

tiple of it be adopted as common unit of resistance, there would still be

wanted a unit for expressing the conducting powers of bodies ; and mercury

is indisputably the best calculated for this purpose. And for practical pur-

poses, which in adopting a universal unit should be principally taken into
consideration, it is indispensable to define the resistance -measure as a geo-
metrical body of that material which is selected as unit of conducting power.
Every other definition would not only burden unnecessarily the calculations

which occur in common life, but also confuse our conception of the measure.
   The reason why the arbitrary unit proposed by Jacobi (a length of copper

only approximately defined) found no admittance into general use is to be
sought in the fact that it failed to fulfil this condition, and because the con-

ducting power of all solid bodies is too dependent on their molecular struc-

ture.

   The same objection renders the adoption of the gold-silver alloy proposed
by Dr. A. Matthiessen equally incapable.

   Another disadvantage in the way of a solid metal unit is the impossibility

to solder thick connexions into the ends of a denned length of any wire
without altering its resistance.

    Should the adoption of the mercury unit be deemed advisable, I would
place at the service of the British Association any further information or assist-

ance in my power.

                                                   Dr. Esselbach.

The two objections against the practical applications of "Weber's absolute

unit bave been sufficiently pointed out as being

    1. Its minuteness ; and

    2. Tbat the electromotive force of galvanic elements does not allow of vari-

ation (as strength of current, tension, and resistance do), but that we have

to accept certain constants as nature has fixed them.

authority if a plain multiple of it were adopted. I need not point out that

It will therefore be practicable to determine such concentration of sulphuric

acid as to make the electromotive force equal to

We should therefore only have to multiply all observations expressed in

              --10 10

Siemens's units by -. to reduce them to absolute measure, and the suggested

multiple for the future standard would not be far from 1-1 of Siemens's units,
which every one admits to be for metallic conductors a practical unit.

   For the resistance of insulating materials the figures become impracticably
high ; but it would be a matter of professional telegraphy to adopt, in con-
formity with the system, the '. resistance ' 10 10 and, besides, another ' great
resistance ' containing 10 10 ' resistances.'

   While the resistance of a mile of copper in an ordinary cable would be (say)
4 R. (four resistances), the insulation-resistance of a mile of cable would be
about 0-04 G. R. (great or gutta-percha resistances).

  My suggestion would therefore be

   1. To adopt Weber's absolute unit, and to derive from it, by the multiple
10 10 (or 10,000,000,000), the practical unit.

   2. To adopt 10 10 of Weber's electro-magnetic units as the 'practical abso-
lute unit ' for electromotive force and resistance.

                   (10 of these units would be exactly 1 Daniell's cell.)
    3. 1 of these units would be 1-1 of Siemens's units.
   4. To allow, besides, a ' practical great unit,' viz. 10 10 of the ' practical

units,' for resistances in order to express the insulation-resistance of cables

in convenient figures.

5. To allow also a ' practical small unit ' of tkt absolute units to express

insulation-currents and charge-quantities of cables in convenient figures.
   6. To adopt, in order to avoid confusion, for such ' practical units ' a

terminology as proposed by Messrs. Bright and Clark.

   I have, in consequence, the honour of addressing you the present letter.
   The Resolutions passed at the two meetings are enclosed, and from them
you will gather the general scope of the Committee's inquiry. I add some
further explanation as to the object and intentions of the Committee.
   Great inconvenience has been felt from the absence of any generally adopted
unit for the measurement of electrical resistance, and it was thought that the
influence of the British Association might be successfully exerted to procure
the adoption of a common standard. The present time was thought especially
favourable, since, although the methods of observation have been brought to
great perfection, no local units have as yet taken very deep root.
   The units which up to the present time have been considered by the

Committee may be classed under three heads :

   A1st. given length and weight or section of wire made of some pure

metal, and observed at a given temperature, as originally proposed by
Professors Wheatstone, Jacobi, and others.

    2nd. Units based on Weber's and Gauss's system of absolute measure-

ment.

  A3rd. given length and section of pure mercury at a given temperature.

   Whatever basis is adopted for the unit, it is proposed that the unit adopted
shall be represented by one particular standard, constructed of very permanent
materials, laid up in a national repository ; and it has been proposed to use
Dr. A. Matthiessen's gold-and-silver alloy for this purpose. The arguments
which have been used for and against these systems are as follows :

    In favour of the use of a wire of some pure metal it is said
    That the plan is the simplest possible, and admits of independent observers
forming their own standard.

    Against the plan it is said

   1st. That even when pure, two apparently similar wires do not resist

--equally unless their temper or molecular condition be the same a condition

which cannot practically be ensured.
    2nd. That there is reason to believe that the resistance of a given wire is

not constant even at a constant temperature.
    3rd. That the resistance of all pure metals varies very rapidly with the

temperature.

    4th. That great difficulty is found in obtaining any metal pure, and that

the attempt of most persons to reproduce the unit for their own use would be
attended with incorrect results. This is evidenced by the different relative
results as to the resistance of pure metals published by different observers.

    In favour of Weber's units it is urged
    1st. That their use will ensure the adoption of a complete system of corre-
sponding standards for electrical currents, quantities, and tension or difference

of potential.

    2nd. That their use is essential in the dynamic treatment of any problem
connected with electricity ; for instance, in determining the heat generated,
the force exerted, the work done, and the chemical action required or pro-

   3rd. That their use would he a simple extension of the system already
universally adopted in magnetic measurements.

   4th. That the unit is independent of the physical properties of any material.
    Against the system it is urged that the unit cannot he determined with
sufficient accuracy, and that even its approximate reproduction, where copies
cannot he obtained, is difficult and expensive.
   In favour of the mercury standard the following arguments are used :

   1st. No change can occur in the molecular structure or temper of the

material, and therefore the same tuhe filled with pure mercury will certainly
always conduct alike.

   2nd. Change of temperature causes only a slight difference in resistance.
    Against this plan it is said
   1st. That tubes cannot be made of uniform or similar wires, and that,
therefore, the standard once broken is lost for ever.
    2nd. That the standard tube cannot be kept full of pure mercury, owing to
the admixture which would take place of the solid metal used for the terminals,
so that each time the standard has to be used it has practically to be remade.
   3rd. That the attempt, by most observers, to reproduce the unit for their

own use would be attended with incorrect results, as is shown by the different

results obtained by different observers.
    In favour of Dr. Matthiessen's alloy, as compared with wires of pure metal,

or with mercury, as a material for the standard, it is said
    1st. That the variations of resistance, corresponding with variations of

temperature or temper, are small.
    2nd. That a unit expressed in this material can be more readily and

certainly reproduced than one expressed by a pure metal, because the
presence of slight impurities in the component metals, or a slight change
in their proportion, does not sensibly affect the result.

    Against this plan it is said that the physical properties of an alloy are
more likely to change than those of a pure metal.

    Against all the plans for standards, based on an arbitrary length and
section of an arbitrary material, the supporters of the absolute units state
that the adoption of such an arbitrary standard would lead to great con-
fusion and complication in the measurement of all other electrical properties,
and in the expression of the relation of such measurements to those of force,
work, heat, ifcc.

    This objection does not, of course, apply to the expression of the absolute

unit by means of a wire of pure metal, of an alloy, or by mercury : but it is
urged that no observer should ever attempt the reproduction of a 'standard
when a copy of the proposed universal standard can possibly be obtained
and the Committee will probably endeavour to devise some plan by which

such copies of the actual material standard adopted may be easily procured at

a reasonable cost.

   It will be seen from the resolutions passed, that the Committee are now

engaged in investigating the degree of accuracy with which Weber's units can

be obtained, and the degree of permanency which may be expected from the

use of the metal or alloy forming the material standard expressing these or

other units.

    The Committee will feel greatly indebted to you if you will afford them the
benefit of your valuable advice and experience on the above points, and on any
others which may occur to you. They also venture to hope that such a standard

may be selected as will give very general satisfaction ; and, if approved by you,

that you will kindly take an interest in procuring its general adoption.

    ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.  159

   Personally being charged with the duty of preparing an historical summary
of the various units proposed, I shall be grateful if you will favour me with

any remarks as to your own labours in this field, or if you could oblige me

with references to any papers or works in which the subject is treated.

                                                                                     Fleejung Jenkik.

Appendix H. Description of the Electrical Apparatus arranged by Mr. Flee-
 ming Jenkin for the production of exact copies of the Standard of Resistance.

   This apparatus is a simple modification of that generally known as "Wheat-

stone's bridge." It contains, however, some special arrangements, in virtue

of which various practical difficulties are avoided, so that very great accuracy
can be ensured with comparative ease. The usual bridge-arrangement is
shown in Plate I. fig. 9, where the irregular scrolls, A, C, R, S, represent the
four conductors of which the resistance is to be compared ; the thick black lines
show those portions of the circuit which join the coils with the four corners,

TJ, V, Z, Y, and are supposed to have no sensible resistance in comparison

with the coils ; finally, the thin lines show connexions, the resistance of
which in no way affects the accuracy of the comparison between the four
coils. By this arrangement the four conductors, A, C, R, S, are so connected
with the galvanometer, G, and the battery, B, that no current passes through
the galvanometer when the conductors bear such a relation to one another that

              AS

the equation q=t5 holds good; whereas a current in one or other direction

                    AS

passes so soon as ^ is greater or less than ^*. Thus the direction and

strength of the current observed serve as guides by which the resistance of

any one of the conductors may be gradually adjusted by shortening or

lengthening the wire, until on the completion of the circuit no deflection

whatever can be observed on the galvanometer, however delicate it may be,
or however powerful the battery used. When this has been done, we may

be sure that the above relation exists between the four conductors. In
practice, it is seldom desirable to use powerful batteries ; the test is made
delicate by the use of an extremely sensitive astatic galvanometer.

    In speaking of the four conductors, A, C, E, S, which are generally all
coils of wire of similar construction, although each fulfilling a distinct
function, some difficulty often occurs in explaining readily which coil or
conductor is referred to. They can of course be distinguished by letters, but
this requires reference to a diagram on every occasion, and the writer has
therefore been in the habit of distinguishing the four coils by names drawn
from a very obvious analogy existing between this electrical arrangement

and the common balance in which one weight is compared with another.
The equality between the two weights on either side of a balance, when the

index is at zero, depends on the equality of the arms of the balance ; and if
the arms are unequal, the weights required to bring the index to zero are

Aproportional to the arms (inversely). Let and C be called the arms of the
Relectrical balance, while S and are looked on as analogous to the standard

weight and mass to be weighed respectively, and let the galvanometer needle

   * This statement holds good also if the battery and galvanometer wires, as shown

in diagram, are interchanged.
160 REPORT--1862.

stand for the index of the balance. Then all the above statements, with

respect to the weights and arms, hold good for the electrical arrangement

(except that the proportion between the electrical arms and weights is direct

instead of inverse). The writer therefore calls this arrangement an electric
--A Rbalance
        and C the arms, S the standard, and the resistance measured*.

In the adjustments of resistance-coils or copies of a standard, the object is to

produce a second coil, R, exactly equal to the first or standard, S; and 'the

arms, A, C, must therefore be absolutely equal before, by this arrangement,

an exact copy can be made. Hitherto it has often been the practice to use

for the arms, A, C, two coils made as equal as possible, and placed so close as

to remain at sensibly equal temperatures ; so that the equality between

R Aand S is dependent on the equality between and C, and cannot be deter-

mined with greater accuracy than that between these coils. This limit to the

accuracy is a defect for our present purpose, and the writer has moreover

found it undesirable to depend on the permanent equality of two coils. It is

by no means certain that, without very extraordinary precautions, the two

Aarms will remain unaltered in their original equality.  slight molecular

change, or a slight chemical action on the surface of the wires, disturbs this

equality permanently ; and even if the coils are so constructed as to remain

really equal at equal temperatures, the accidental passage of a current through

one arm, and not through the other, for a very short time, will disturb their

accuracy very sensibly for a considerable time. There are various devices by

which the equality to be established between It and S may be rendered

Aindependent of the absolute equality between and C, and the writer has

adopted a plan, now to be explained with the aid of the diagrams (figs. 7, 8).

This plan allows the approximation to equality between II and S to be almost

indefinitely increased.

It will be seen that fig. 7 does not differ from fig. 9, except by the addition

WX, Aof a wire,
        of sensible resistance, between the two coils and C. The

Upoint is no longer fixed, but can be moved along WX. The arms of the

XU +A +Abalance are therefore no longer and C, but
                                                   and C WU. Thus

Uthe moveable point affords the means of slightly altering or adjusting the

Aratio of the two arms.  and C are made as equal as possible, independently

--of "WX, which is a very short wire.
  The test is made as follows : When the standard and coil to be measured

Uhave been put in their places as in fig. 7, the point is moved along the
WXwire
        until the galvanometer-index is not deflected when the circuit is

Rclosed. The position of the point TJ is noted by a scale.  and S are then

reversed, so as to occupy the position relatively to A, C shown in fig. 8. The

point TJ is again moved until the galvanometer-needle remains undeflected on

Uthe circuit's being closed. The new position of is again observed by a

Uscale. If the point does not require to be moved at all, we may be quite

   * The name of parallelogram, sometimes given to the arrangement, is objectionable,
inasmuch as the relation obtaining between the four conductors is not that which exists
between the four sides of any parallelogram, except in the one case of equality between all
four conductors. The connexions are, however, most easily followed in a drawing when
arranged as the four sides of a quadrilateral figure. Professor Wheatstone's original name

of Differential Kesistance Measurer does not, as it seems to the writer, sufficiently distin-
guish this arrangement from other differential methods.

Awire as the coils and C, and if those coils are formed of about 100 inches

of wire, and if the observed positions of TJ differ by a given distance, cc, this

length, x, measured in inches, will express very nearly the difference between

R and S in a percentage of the whole length of R. Thus, if a; be one inch,

Rthe standards S and differ by about one per cent. If the point IT, when
R Radjusted in each case, be found nearer than S, then is the smaller of the two,

and vice versa. The percentage of error in R, thus measured, is not of course

strictly accurate, inasmuch as the ratio between the two arms is not exactly

jqq ; but if

of error measured in this way is quite sufficiently accurate to allow the new

coil to be so exactly adjusted after very few trials, that no greater movement

Uof than (say) J^th of an inch is required to prevent any deflection on the
Rgalvanometer when and S are reversed. We may then be sure that no

greater error than (say) about 0-1 per cent, exists in the equality between

the new coil and the standard. Two fresh coils, A,, Cv are then taken,
WX,containing each about 1000 inches of wire similar to
                                                              or an equivalent

resistance. It will then be found that, to maintain the index at zero when
R and S are reversed, U must be moved about ten times as much as before,
R Uor (say) one inch.
                                                              can then be still further adjusted till is not moved

more than jLth of an inch, when a new degree of approximation to equality,

with an error of not more than 0-01 per cent., will have been reached. Then

Athe coils Aj, C, are changed for a fresh pair, 2, C2, with a resistance equal
WX WXto about 1 0,000 inches of the wire
                                                              : one-tenth of an inch on  will

then represent an error of only 0-001 per cent. By a repetition of this

process, quite independently of any absolute equality between the pairs A, C,

A-i> ®i> -A-2> Qj> &c -> a gradual approximation to any required extent may be

ensured. The delicacy of the galvanometer used, and the nicety of the means

available for increasing or diminishing the resistance of R, form the only

Alimits to the approximation.                                 slight want of equality between any pair of

Uarms will simply bring the point a little to one side or the other of the

WX,centre of  as the final adjustment with that pair is made, but will not

Raffect the truth of the comparison between and S. Each pair must, however,

WX,be so nearly equal that the addition of part of the short wire,  to one side

Uwill be sufficient to correct the other ; otherwise the adjustible point would

not bring the index to zero, even when at one end of the wire.

    This arrangement, besides rendering us independent of the accuracy of
any two arms, has some incidental advantages of considerable practical

importance. At each test it gives a measure of the amount by which the
new coil to be adjusted must be lengthened or shortened. The test is at first

comparatively rough, or adapted to errors of one or two per cent., and only

gradually increases in delicacy as the desired equality is more and more
WXnearly approached. It is not necessary that the resistance of
                                                                                         should

remain absolutely constant, since it is only used (numerically) to give a

rough approximation to the percentage of error. It is desirable that the

battery should remain in circuit as short a time as possible ; the circuit is

therefore broken between 1 and 2, figs. 7 and 8, by a key, K, with which

contact should be only momentarily made, when all the other connexions are

complete. The direction of the jerk of the galvanometer-needle to one side

or the other need alone be observed; no permanent deflection is required with

this arrangement as a guide to the amount of error. This is a considerable

advantage, inasmuch as it avoids heating the wires, and saves time. The

induction of the coils on themselves might lead to some false indications.

unless special precaution -were taken against it, as pointed out by Professor

"W. Thomson*. To avoid this source of error, the galvanometer circuit is

Kbroken between 3 and 4, figs. 7 and 8, at v and should only be closed after
Kthe battery circuit has been completed at
                                                                                                and equilibrium established

throughout all the conductors.

Before passing to a detailed description of the apparatus as actually con-

structed, some remarks are required as to the means of making temporary

connexions. All connexions "which require to be altered may be the means

of introducing errors, inasmuch as the points of contact are very apt to offer

a sensible but uncertain resistance. In measuring small resistances, the

resistance at the common binding-screws is found to create very considerable

errors. Binding-screws have therefore to be avoided at all points where an

uncertain resistance could cause error. Mercury-cups, made as follows, have

been found in practice very suitable for temporary connexions, and have been

adopted in the apparatus. The bottom of each cup is a stout copper plate,

with its surface well amalgamated, forming one of the two terminals to be

Ajoined.               stout copper wire, 1 inch in diameter, with a flat end well amal-

gamated, forms the other terminal. When the amalgamation is good, and

care is taken that the wire shall rest on the plate, this form of connexion

offers no sensible resistance. The amalgamated wire is easily kept bright

aud clean by being dipped from time to time in a solution of chloride of

mercury and wiped. The copper plate should also be removed from the cup,

cleaned, and re-amalgamated occasionally. All permanent connexions should

be soldered.

The apparatus itself, as actually constructed, will now be described (figs. 1

to 6). It consists of a wooden board, about 12 in. x 7 in., containing the

mercury-cups, the adjusting wire, "WX, the key, K, and the terminals to which

the battery and galvanometer are connected. The letters in the figures

1 to 6 correspond exactly to those used in the diagrams 7 and 8 ; and the

apparent complexity of the connexions can thus be easily disentangled.

purposes, give the best results ; and one or two elements will be found a

The apparatus, although specially designed for the production of equal

ance-coils should be put in the place of the standard S, and any conductor of

is, however, frequently desirable to make a comparison with one arm ten-

Preliminary Report of the Committee for Investigating the Chemical
   and Mineralogical Composition of the Granites of Donegal, and the
    Minerals associated with them.

In accordance with the resolution of the General Committee at the Man-

chester Meeting, the Committee, consisting of Sir E. Griffith, the Eev. Prof.
Haughton, and Mr. Scott, proceeded to investigate " the chemical and mine-

                                                                  m2

ralogical composition of the granites of Donegal, and the minerals associated

with them." In furtherance of this object, Mr. Haughton and Mr. Scott re-

paired, last Easter, to the northern part of the county, as they had visited the

S.W. portion of the district in the summer of 1861. They were accompanied

on their tour by Mr. Jukes, Local Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland,

who gave them the valuable benefit of his experience and assistance throughout

the tour. The exploration commenced at Moville, on the E. shore of Innis-

howen, whence a section was earned along the N. coast of that peninsula

pearly as far as Malin Head. This section exhibited a great thickness of

"primary rocks, consisting of quartzite and mica-slate, accompanied by several

beds of limestone, and a number of beds of igneous rocks, which appeared to

be contemporaneous with the sedimentary rocks. These are best exhibited at a

place called the Mintiaghs or Bar of Inch, where there are several alternations

of quartz-rock and syenite exhibited in an escarpment of several hundred feet

in height. This locality is situated about five miles N". of Buncrana. From

Bimcrana. the granite of Urrismcnagh, near DunafF Head, was visited.

Erom Milford an excursion was made to the extremity of the promontory

of Fanad, lying between Lough Swilly and Sheep Haven, in order to visit the

granite of this district. This patch of granite is not a continuation of that

which traverses the country in a N.E. and S.W. direction, as it lies to the

K". of that axis and exhibits a slight difference in composition from the granite

of the central axis. From Milford the route lay to Divnfanaghy ; and a section

was made across the northern end of the granitic axis of the county at Glen,

in which its gneissose character was very strongly exhibited. This was

marked in a most decisive manner between Lackagh Bridge and Creeshlagh,

where the rock might be observed changing from gneiss, by almost insensible

gradations, on the one hand into granite, and on the other into hornblende slate

and crystalline syenite. The latter is most highly crystalline at Horn Head,

where it contains large quantities of titanic iron. On the return-journey from

Dunfanaghy to Letterkenny, it was determined to make two sections across

the  granite                                 so  that Mr.  Haughton  and  Mr.  Scott  took  the  road  from  Creesh-
                                          ;

lagh through the Gap of Barnesbeg, while Mr. Jukes took that by Owencarrow

Bridge, about four miles higher up the valley.

It having now been found necessaiy to compare the facts observed with

those which were to be observed in other countries, Sir B. Griffith repaired

to Scotland in the month of July. Mr. Haughton traversed the centre of

Scotland, and paid a visit to Sweden, Finland, and Bussia. Both these gen-

tlemen discovered facts strongly confirming the views propounded at the

Manchester Meeting, of the similarity of the geological structure of Donegal

to that of the Scandinavian peninsula and of Scotland. For this latter fact

the Committee had been prepared by the examination of a series of specimens

of Scotch granites which had been furnished to them by Sir B. I. Murchison,

in accordance with his kind promise made at the last Meeting.

While these tours were in progress, Mr. Scott repaired, for the third time,

to Donegal, and spent the month of July in the re-examination of several

points connected with the geology of the southern district. He visited the

granite of Barnesmore, near the town of Donegal, which is essentially non-

gneissose, and is penetrated by numerous pitchstone dykes, some of which

are amygdaloidal. Numerous minerals were discovered here, which were in
some cases new to the district. In the neighbourhood of Glenties, a consi-

--derable quantity of andalusite was found in the mica-slate a mineral which

is replaced near Barnesmore by kyanite, and in the Bosses, near Dungloe, by

a white variety of kyanite.
ON THE VERTICAL MOVEMENTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.  165

    From Dungloe, as head-quarters, the structure of Crohy Head was carefully
examined, and also the island of Arranniore, which differs materially in its
structure from the mainland of Ireland, from which it is only distant three
miles. The southern portion of this island is nearly entirely composed of
white granite, penetrated by numerous dykes of syenite and of felspathic
porphyry. The strike of these rocks is neaily E. and W., while that of the

flaggy quartz-rocks on the northern shore of the island approaches N. and S.
    During the course of this tour, two more sections were made across the

granite of the main axis, exhibiting the same facts which had been observed
before, viz. numerous beds of limestone and of altered slate lying in the
granite, stratified nearly conformably with it. These were observed in the
centre of Glenveagh, close to Ballaghgeeha Gap, on the pass through the
Poisoned Glen from Dunlewy. At Glenleheen, where the same occurrence
of non-granitic rocks had been observed in the previous year, four beds of
limestone and several beds of slate were discovered. Almost all these beds
of limestone contained garnet, idocrase, and epidote in quantity ; and at Glen-
leheen itself, scapolite, a mineral whose occurrence in the British Islands has
escaped the notice of modern English mineralogists, was discovered. Inas-
much as the specimens brought home by the members of the Committee
from their several tours are very numerous, it is not possible for them to
present their complete report at this Meeting. They hope to embody in it
some valuable information relating to the granitic rocks of Canada, which
Dr. T. Sterry Hunt has kindly offered to supply to them. They have to
express their thanks to him and to Mr. Harte, C.E., county surveyor of the
western district of the county, who, with the Rev. Frederick Corfield, has
afforded them most efficient assistance. They have succeeded in procuring
some of the granite of Eockall, through the kindness of the officers of H.M.S.
Porcupine, who furnished it to Mr. Harte, and will include its analysis in

their paper.

On the Vertical Movements of the Atmosphere considered in connexion
   with Storms and Changes of Weather. By Henry Hennessy,

    F.R.S., M.R.I. A., fyc, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the
    Catholic University of Ireland.

The labours of the Committee, consisting of Admiral FitzEoy, Mr. Glaisher,
and myself, who were appointed, at Manchester, for the purpose of studying

the vertical disturbances of the atmosphere with the aid of instruments,
have, for the present, been restricted to the work of a single observer. This
has arisen from the circumstance that the money-grant appropriated to the
Committee has sufficed only to defray the cost of erecting a single instrument.

As this instrument is likely to afford opportunities for observing the vertical
motions of the atmosphere more completely than has been hitherto possible,

it is to be hoped that similar apparatus will before long be in the hands of
the other members of the Committee. The fact that all the preliminary work
has thus necessarily devolved on the writer of the present Eeport will suffi-
ciently account also for its provisional nature.

   Hitherto the only kind of atmospherical currents which have formed the
subjects of definite observation by instruments are those whose existence is
manifested by the movements of ordinary wind-vanes and anemometers.
But as these instruments indicate horizontal movements exclusively, ordinary
166 report--1862.

winds as well as storms are almost always conceived as currents flowing in

perfect parallelism to the earth's surface. It is true that no physical theory
of the motions of the atmosphere can be attempted without some considera-

tions which involve the necessity of vertical and oblique motions among the

masses of air, as well as horizontal motions ; but while direct comparisons of

the latter among themselves have continued for many years to be made in
different parts of the world, we possess scarcely any such data relative to
non-horizontal movements as would enable us to make the.m subjects of exact

inquiry.

   The only writer who, as far as I am aware, has hitherto endeavoured to

deduce any well-defined results from observation relative to the vertical

movements of the atmosphere is M. Foumet, and his studies were almost ex-

clusively directed to the elucidation of the phenomena of some remarkable

local winds that frequently prevail among the Alps and in the valley of the

ARhone*.  local phenomenon in Ireland + induced me to study the vertical

motions of the air in a more general way than was necessary for the explana-

tion of this phenomenon itself ; and my first step was an attempt at devising

a vane capable of showing the existence and direction of non-horizontal

currents. This was a non-registering instrument, and the results obtained

were therefore somewhat unconnected ; but they seemed to establish some

important relations between vertical currents and other atmospherical dis-

turbances J. Among these, I may be permitted to notice the phenomena
which preceded the disastrous gale of February 9, 1861. For many days, at

the close of January and beginning of February, the weather was remarkably

fine, and no vertical currents were observed ; but on the 7th very distinct

evidences of vertical disturbance came under my notice, while the air had as
yet no remarkable horizontal motion. On the 8th, at 2 p.m., my attention

was called to the vane by its shifting round through N". towards N\E., with
decided and frequent downward plunges of the disk exposed to the vertical

action of the air. It appeared as if showers of cold air were descending ; for
the thermometer showed at the same time a rapidly falling temperature.

While vertical convection had become already highly developed, the horizontal

motion of the air was not as yet greater than that of an ordinary brisk

breeze.

   Next day, during the storm, although the disk of the vane was in constant

oscillation from the undulatory motion which my observations had already

shown to be a necessary accompaniment of all high winds passing over
terrestrial obstacles, no marked prevalence of upward or downward motious

could be observed corresponding to the plunges of the disk noticed on the
preceding day. The mercury in the barometer had been falling with great

regularity during four days before that on which I had noticed the first

decided indications of vertical disturbance. On that and the next day, as

well as on the very day of the storm, the barometric column was rising,
while the temperature was steadily falling. Here the rise in the barometer
was accompanied by north-easterly winds, and the air at the earth's surface
was thus rapidly mingled with cooler masses descending from above, as shown
by the vane ; so that the increased pressure was due to the increased density
of the entire aerial column above the barometer.

ON THE VERTICAL MOVEMENTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.                        167

   Among the phenomena attending the more tranquil conditions of the air,
1 had noticed in my earlier observations, during the summer of 1857, that

upward currents generally prevailed by day, while downward currents became

more prominent at night. This alternation was manifestly connected, as

shown by the horizontal vane, with the action of land and sea breezes ; for at
this time the observations were made at a point situated about two miles

from the sea-shore. By day, the convection due to the heating of the lower

stratum of air in contact with the ground could not take place by equal

upward and downward exchanges of masses of air, because the place of the
ascending warm air was partly supplied by the lateral influx of colder sea air,

which, in its turn, would become sufficiently heated to ascend and give place

to a fresh lateral influx. By night, the colder air from the land flowed

towards the sea, and its place was filled by descending currents from above.

At the same time the warmer ah- from the sea probably tended to occupy the

place of these currents, and thus to equalize the temperature of the upper

and lower strata of air so as to lessen the energy of the convective movement

over the land.

Before the termination of the Meeting of the Association at Manchester, I

had resolved, with the concurrence of Mr. Glaisher, the only other member of

the Committee then present, to cause a registering instrument to be con-

structed which would record the existence of non-horizontal atmospheric

motions. The following is a description of the anemoscope which I ultimately

decided upon as most suitable in its construction for the purposes we have in

view. Fig. 1 is a vertical section of the portion of the apparatus which is

Aexposed to the wind, and fig. 3 an elevation of the same portion.  is a

cast-iron pillar which supports a cup, h, containing friction-balls made of gun-

metal ; on these a disk, g, rests, and this is firmly attached to a box from
which an arm projects at one side, and is terminated by the cone, P, which

acts as a counterpoise for the opposite and working arm of the anemoscope.

A short arm, n, shown in fig. 3, supports a wheel, d, in one side of which teeth

are cut ; the other side is firmly attached to a hollow light copper box, B,

which forms the tail. This box is a truncated pyramid, and while its vertical

sides are exposed to the horizontal action of the wind, its upper and lower

surfaces are exposed to its vertical action. This tail is balanced by a coun-

terpoise, i, which is connected by a bent arm with the axle of the wheel, d.
The teeth of this wheel catch those of the pinion, e (fig. 1), and this catches in
the rack, /. The rack is attached to a shaft, c, which descends through the

hollow supporting pillar and communicates with the registering apparatus.

In fig. 2 the most essential part of the arrangements for registering the

indications of the upper part of the instrument are shown. The shaft, c,
passes through brass guides, and carries a small circular projecting piece, s,
which catches in a notch made in the bit, v, attached to the pencil-carrier, p.
This pencil-carrier is capable of upward and downward motions only, and
the rod to which it is attached passes through guides. The carrier is, more-
over, supported by an ivory friction-wheel, t, which turns when the piece, s,

revolves beneath it.

   From this brief description, it is apparent that the cone, P, will always indi-
cate the direction of the wind in azimuth, like ordinary vanes. At the same

time the vertical component (if any) of the wind will raise or depress the tail,
B. In the former case it is manifest that the wheel, d, will cause e to turn, so

as to raise the rack, /, and in the latter case the effect will be to lower the
rack. It follows, therefore, that the shaft, c, and consequently the pencil-

carrier which it moves, must rise or fall according as the vertical motion of
168 REPORT 1862.

Athe air is upward or downward.  spring within the pencil-carrier con-

stantly presses tho pencil against a sheet of paper placed in front of it. This

paper is for the present carried on a flat board, which is moved by a clock.

The registering sheets are ruled with vertical hour lines and with horizontal

lines which assist in estimating the angle of inclination to the horizon made
by the disk during the action of an upward or downward impulse from the
air. This follows because the tail and the wheel, d, revolve on the same
centre, and each tooth in d describes an arc similar to that described by the

axis of the tail. An equal number of teeth in e are raised or lowered, and

thus the rack and the shaft, c, move through spaces proportional to arcs de-
scribed by the teeth of the wheel, d, and the axis of the tail, B. The board

which, carries the registering paper can be detached by loosening a clamping-
scre-w which fastens it to the support turned by the clock, so that the sheets
can be removed and replaced with speed and facility.

   The entire apparatus was constructed by Mr. Spencer, of Aungier Street,
Dublin ; and he has executed the portion connected with the indication of
horizontal movement in such a way, that the addition of a registering apparatus

for this part of the instrument will not only be easy, but will render the

entire combination a complete indicator of the absolute direction of the wind.

The results of the instrument in its present state are exhibited on the regis-
tering sheets as nearly vertical pencil lines, some above and some below the
neutral line, to which each sheet is carefully adjusted.

   The anemoscope is at present so placed as not to be overtopped by any

building ; for it stands on the roof of one of the highest houses in Dublin, in a
quarter remarkably open, and close to the south suburbs.

   Owing to a variety of delays and obstacles in finishing the apparatus, it was

not brought into action until the 31st of August, and thus I am able to report

only on the residts furnished by little more than the records of a single month.
These records appear to indicate that vertical oscillations prevail more during
the mid-day hours than at other periods ; for although ten sheets show no
definite predominance at any specific period of the day, and two predominance
of vertical movements towards midnight, twenty-one show that these move-

ments are most frequent at the hours about noon. From a journal of the
weather which was kept at the same time, it appeared that on bright days,
when the air had little horizontal motion, gentle upward movements pre-
vailed at mid-day. Such phenomena are distinctly manifested by the sheets

for September the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, and all of these were bright
sunny days. Before the 5th, the weather had been changeable and unsettled
but on comparing the two sheets comprehending from noon of the 3rd to noon
of the 5th, I noticed that the amplitude of the osculations of the anemoscope

progressively and regularly diminished; and it occurred to me that this

might indicate a tendency towards convective equilibrium of the atmosphere,
and more settled weather. The weather continued fine until the 13th, -when
there was both high wind and rain, accompanied and preceded by energetic
oscillations of the anemoscope. If the general circulation of the atmosphere

takes place, as seems to be now completely established, by a twofold motion,

one of translation, whether cyclonic or lineal, and the other undulatory, it

follows that the pulsations of the latter movement may be influenced by aerial

disturbances. The frequency, regularity, intensity, prevalent direction, and
more or less intermittent character of these pulsations must depend on varia-
tions of pressure, density, moisture, and temperature, as well as on the
rippling motion of the air. It is natural, therefore, to expect, what our
limited number of observations seem already to indicate, namely, that the
sudden and abrupt commencement of such pulsations is usually a precursor
of other disturbances, while their gradual and regular diminution in energy
woidd show a tendency in the air to approach a state of convective equili-
brium, and might, therefore, be safely relied upon as a forerunner of fine
weather. This point is illustrated by the remarks of the late Professor
Daniell relative to the rapid oscillations of the water-barometer during high
winds, and their gradual diminution preceding a return to a tabner state of
the air*. Although the atmospheric pulse is undoubtedly compounded of the
undulatory movements resulting from the flow of an elastic fluid over the

--170 REPORT 1862.

irregularities of the earth's surface, with the effects of convection, in such a

way as would render the separation of these effects extremely difficult, yet
the careful study of this pulse in connexion with other phenomena may he

reasonably expected to add to our power of forming correct conclusions
regarding the coming changes of the weather.

                           3

clude terms of the fourth order, there will be 24 coefficients to be determined.

Each given value of X, Y, or Z, on the earth's surface, furnishes an equation
                                        on gauss's theory and terrestrial magnetism.                                                                     171

among these unknown coefficients ; and for each place at which the three
elements are known we have three such equations. Hence to obtain the

general expressions of X, Y, Z, to the fourth order inclusive, it is theoretically

sufficient to know the three elements at eight points on the earth's surface.

But, owing to the errors of observation, and to the influence of the terms

neglected in the approximation, the number of determinations must, in prac-
tice, be much greater than the number of unknown coefficients.

The foregoing conclusions are hased upon the hypotheses that magnetic

attraction and repulsion vaiy according to the inverse square of the distance,

and that the magnetic action of the globe is the resultant of the actions of all

its parts. It is likewise assumed that there are two magnetic fluids in every

magnetizable element, and that magnetization consists in their separation. '

But for these hypotheses we may substitute that of Ampere, which supposes

the magnetic force to be due to electric currents circulating round the mole-

cules of bodies.

This theory may be applied to the changes of terrestrial magnetism, whe-

ther regular or irregular, provided only that the causes of these changes act

in the same manner as galvanic currents, or as separated magnetic fluids.

We have only to consider whether the data which we possess are sufficient

for such an application.

   It has been already stated that, for the general determination of X, Y, and

Z, we must know their values at eight points (at least) on the earth's sur-

face, these points being as widely distributed as possible. The same thing
holds with respect to the changes oX, hY, IZ ; and to apply the formula? so
determined, and to compare them with observation, corresponding values
must be known for (at least) one more point. In the case of the irregular

changes these observations must, of course, be simultaneous. The regular

changes must be inferred from observations extending over considerable

periods                                 and there                             is reason to  believe that these periods must be identical,
                                     ;

or nearly so, for all the stations, since the changes are known to vary from
month to month and from year to year,

The regular variations of the three elements X, Y, Z, or their theoretical

equivalents, have been obtained by observation, for nearly the same period,

at Greenwich, Dublin,                                                         and Makerstoun, in  the British  Islands                                   at Brussels

North America                                                                 at Simla, Madras, and Singapore, in India ;  and at St. Helena,
                                                                           ;

the Cape of Good Hope, and Hobarton, in the southern hemisphere. Of these

thirteen stations, however, the three British must be regarded, for the pre-

sent purpose, as equivalent to one only, on account of their proximity ; and

the same thing may be said of the two North American stations and of the

two stations in Hindostan. This reduces the number of available stations to
nine, the minimum number required for the theoretical solution of the pro-

blem in the degree of approximation already referred to, and considered by

Gauss to be necessary. It is true that we may add to these the stations at

which two only of the three elements have been observed, viz. Prague and

St. Petersburg, the three Russian stations in Siberia, and Bombay. But even

with this addition, the number is probably insufficient for the satisfactory

determination of the unknown coefficients ; for it is to be remembered that

the places, few as they are, are not distributed with any approach to uni-

formity, and that very large portions of the globe are wholly unrepresented
by observations.

    For the reason already stated, this defect in the existing data cannot be

now repaired by supplemental observations at new stations, unless the series

at all were so far extended as to embrace the whole period of the cyclical

changes.

   The simultaneous observation of the irregular changes is limited nearly to

the same stations. In their case, too, there is the further imperfection, as
respects the present problem, that the changes observed on "term-days"
are for the most part inconsiderable, while those on days of great magnetic
disturbance have seldom been observed continuously for any considerable

time at all the stations.

For the foregoing reasons the Committee are of opinion that the data which

we at present possess respecting the changes of terrestrial magnetism, whether

regular or irregular, are not sufficient for the application of Gauss's theory,

if, as above assumed, the approximation is to be extended so as to include

terms  of  the  fourth  order  (P          to  P      inclusive).  It is deserving of considera-

tion, however, whether an inferior degree of approximation may not afford

some valuable information. The affirmative side of this question has been so

earnestly advocated by one of the members of the Committee, that it has been

thought advisable to append his letter on the subject to this Report.

 --" My dear Sir, I am sorry to have been so long prevented from writing

to you on the subject of the Committee's Report on the expression of the
Variations of the Terrestrial Magnetic elements in series of Laplace's functions.

    " I perfectly agree with the conclusions stated in the draft report of which

you sent me a proof, so far as they relate to a complete expression of any class

of variations of the elements, or of any individual variation, by means of
which its amount in other localities than those of observation could be de-
termined with any considerable approach to accuracy. But, on the other
hand, the amount of knowledge from observation, shown in the report to be
available, would, I believe, be sufficient to allow us to estimate, possibly with
considerable accuracy, and certainly with a sufficient approach to accuracy
for highly important application, the first terms in the harmonic (Laplace's)
series. I would therefore advise that some such method as the following

should be adopted.
    " Choosing any particular variation, for instance the diurnal or the secular,

for which the data from observation are most abundant, find either by trial
and error, or any other proper algebraic method, an expression by terms of
the first order (three coefficients for each) for the three elements which most
nearly represent it. (The method of least squares would give a precise de-
finition of what would be the most near representation, on this principle ; but
ruder and quicker methods might suffice in first trials.) Then, judging by

+the results, tiy similarly for expressions in series of two terms (3 5, or eight

coefficients in all, in each expression). After trials of this kind it would be

easy to judge within what limits may be the probable errors of the estimated

first terms from the true first terms, and possibly even to arrive at some
probable knowledge regarding the true second terms of the harmonic ex-

pressions.

   "Avery moderate degree of success in such operations as these would

allow us to decide whether the origin (magnetic or electrodynamic) of the

variation is within the earth's surface or outside.

  " I hope, then, a result of the Committee's action may be to carry out an

attempt of this kind for every class of variations for which the data give even

the narrowest foundation. It might be applied, I believe, with success, as
regards the main conclusion, to every case in which each of the three compo-

nents has been well determined for even only xhbee stations widely apart

from one another.
    " It seems probable that an individual deflection of a magnetic storm cannot

be identified in localities at very great distances from one another. This must
certainly be the case if an individual deflection, and individual flash or flicker

of aurora, are simply related to one another, because the individual auroras

are certainly local in the sense of being only seen at once over a very limited

area of the earth, being in fact actually situated at some distance of not more

than 150 miles (which I believe is the highest estimate) from the surface.
Heuce it is probable that it will be found whether the seat of the disturbing
action, producing an individual deflection in a magnetic storm, is above or
below the surface, by comparing observations made at stations within a few
hundred miles of one another, and endeavouring to identify a single disturb-
ance in the three components at all the localities. If the three components
could thus be determined at three localities so wide apart as to show con-
siderable differences in the amounts, but yet not so wide as to render the

identification of the disturbance difficult, the question whether the seat of the
disturbance is in the earth or the air woidd be answered with high proba-

bility.

           On Thermo-electric Currents in Circuits of one Metal.
                          By Fleeming Jenkin, Esq.

Last year I had the honour of directing the attention of the Association to

the fact, that an electric current of considerable intensity may be obtained in

a circuit of one metal by the application of heat to one or the other side of an
interruption in the wire composing the circuit. The experiment is most
simply performed by looping together the two ends of two perfectly similar
wires connected to the terminals of a galvanometer, and heating one of the
loops to a white or red heat in a spirit-lamp, or Bunsen's burner. If the one
loop rests very lightly on the other a current will be obtained, which in the
copper wires will flow from the hot to the cold loop across the joint with
sufficient intensity to deflect a moderately sensitive galvanometer, even with
a resistance in circuit equal to 1000 miles of No. 16 copper wire.

   The electromotive force of the combination is about one-tenth that of a
Daniell's cell. "With two iron loops a permanent current in the opposite
direction is obtained, flowing from cold to hot across the joint, but the elec-
tromotive force in this case is very much smaller.

   "When the loops are drawn tightly together the current ceases, but reappears

as soon as the strain is slackened.

   I was at the time unable to show the connexion between these singular

currents and other electrical phenomena, but I am now, in consequence of

further experiments undertaken for the Association, able to point out that
connexion.
174 report--1862.

   The currents were clearly not due to chemical action on the wires ; for, in
the first place, currents of considerable strength were obtained from two per-
fectly homogeneous platinum wires, flowing from hot to cold across the loose
contact ; and in the second place, the direction of the current was different in
copper and iron, whereas the chemical action undergone by the wire was alike
in tbe two cases.

   The researches of Becquerel, Pouillet, Buff, Hankel, and Grove were ex-
amined, to see whether the electricity produced during combustion, or the
properties of flame, would account for the currents, but it was found that all
the electrical effects produced by flame could be divided into two classes : first,
phenomena depending on the relative position of the two wires in the flame
and secondly, phenomena depending on the voltaic couple formed by the

Mymetals used, and the hot vapour acting as an electrolyte between them.

results were independent of the position of the wires in the flame, and could
not be accounted for by supposing these wires to form a voltaic couple, inas-

much as though in some cases, where wires of two metals were looped together

as described, the current flowed from the metal most attacked across the

imaginary electrolyte to the other wire, in other cases it flowed in the oppo-

site direction.

    It remained to be seen whether the currents might not have a thermo-
electric origin. Last year I imagined that the effect observed might be di-
rectly due to discontinuity, but that idea was dispelled by some experiments
with loose contacts between wires of different metals, which have thrown
great light on the question.

    Loops of iron, silver, platinum, gold, and copper wires were combined two
by two in all the possible arrangements, and the currents measured which
were obtained when one or the other or both loops were heated with loose
and tight contacts between them.

  A Table was thus formed, which is appended to the present paper.

   The resistance of the circuit was so large (2050 x 10% Weber's absolute

               t-~)  that  the inherent  resistance  of  the  joint  and  of  the  different  short

seconds'                                                      °

wires used in each experiment could be neglected, and the deflections ob-

tained on a reflecting galvanometer could be taken as approximatively pro-

portional to the electromotive force of each combination. The common

thermo-electric currents produced by the metallic contact between dissimilar

wires almost vanish in comparison with those produced by the loose contacts.

I need not present a complete analysis of the Table, but will speak only of

the combination of iron and copper with which the most remarkable results

were obtained. When the usual tight metallic contact was made between

these two wires and the two loops equally heated, the current first flowed

from copper to iron across the joint, and then as the temperature rose ceased

altogether, and finally, at a red or white heat, flowed from iron to copper.

The maximum deflection obtained in either direction was three divisions.

These deflections showed the celebrated inversion discovered by Cumming.

If the pressure between the loops was relaxed, the current ceased alto-

gether ; but when the loops were moved, so that the copper became red-hot

while the iron was cool, a current flowed from the copper to the iron, or from

hot to cold across the joint, giving a deflection of 100 divisions ; whereas if

the iron was heated red-hot and the copper cooled, a current giving 90 divi-

sions flowed in the opposite direction, or from iron to copper, but from hot

to cold as before. Thus in these two cases the loose-contact currents given

when one or the other loop was heated, flowed in the opposite direction be-
      ON THERMO-ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CIRCUITS OF ONE METAL. 175

tween the metals, but in both cases from hot to cold across the joint, and
were in each case about thirty times as great as the currents given by the
thermo-electric difference between the metals.

   It was found on examining the Table, that wherever copper appeared in con-

--junction with any other of the metals named, the direction of the loose-con-

tact current could invariably be determined by the following rule : "When
the copper was the hot wire, the current flowed from the copper to the other
metal across the joint ; but when copper was the cold metal, the current flowed
from the other metal to the copper, or in both cases from hot to cold.

    Exactly the contrary was found wherever iron appeared in conjunction
with any of the five metals but copper ; the current then always flowed from

cold to hot. Two copper wires alone gave the largest deflection, of about 220

divisions ; and two iron wires alone gave the next largest of those obtained
where single metals only were used, but of course in the opposite direction
to the deflection from copper.

    It was then perceived that all these results would be explained if the thin
coating of oxide on the copper wire might be regarded as a conductor with a
hot and cold junction, and endowed with thermo-electric properties far more
positive than the iron, while at the same time the coating of oxide on the
iron wire would have to be regarded as far more negative than the copper.
It was, however, difficult to suppose that two bodies so similar in some re-
spects as the oxides of copper and iron should be at opposite extremities of
the thermo-electric scale, but the following direct experiment left no doubt

on my mind.

   A little spiral was made of platinum wire, and a small quantity of oxide of

 copper laid upon it, and held in a flame till white-hot ; another platinum wire

was then dipped in the melted mass, when a strong current was at once ob-
served from the hot to the cold wire, as if a loose contact had been made

between two copper wires. When either of the oxides of iron was tested in

 a similar manner, a strong current was obtained from the cold to the hot
 platinum wire, as if a loose contact had been made between two iron wires.

    I do not yet know positively what the substances are which, interposed

between silver and platinum and gold wires, give rise to the loose-contact

 currents, but I feel no doubt that these are as much thermo-electric currents
 as those given by the oxides of copper and iron, and are produced in a circuit

 composed of the metal and a veiy thin hot film, of which the two surfaces are

 unequally heated.
     There are, however, some good reasons for doubting whether electrolytes

 can be included in a true thermo-electric series, and I consulted many autho-
 rities with reference to this point. Seebeck himself includes many electrolytes

 in his thermo-electric scale, and places acids below bismuth, a result con-
 firmed lately by Gore (in 1857) ; he also places certain salts above antimony,
 a result subsequently confirmed by Andrews of Belfast in 1837. This
 gentleman observed that the tension produced by the salts between the wires
 was about equal to that between a platinum and silver plate in dilute sulphuric
 acid, and that the metals used as electrodes did not influence the deflection.

 He considered the current certainly due to a thermo-electric action.

     Faraday in 1833 discovered what Becquerel subsequently called pyro-elec-
 tric currents ; the currents were in different directions with different substances
 used, and some, if not all, were of the same nature as those I have described.
 Leroux and Buff obtained currents where glass acted as the electrolyte.
 Leroux considered them thermo-electric, and Buff chemical effects. Buff
 also attributes some of the electrical phenomena connected with flame to a
--176 report 1862.

 thermo-electric action in which unequally heated air or gas forms part of

 the circuit. The currents obtained when a hot and cold platinum wire are
 dipped into dilute sulphuric acid and other liquids are well known ; and
 finally (in 1858), Mr. Wild published a laborious research, in which he seems

 to prove the development of thermo-electric currents not only at the junction
 between metals and various solutions, but also between two different solutions.
 Thus, although none of the above observers seem to have tested the oxides,

there seems little reason to doubt that they may be classed with other elec-
trolytes, and may give rise to currents in the same manner. On the other

hand, I cannot yet consider it definitively proved that any of the currents
 obtained from electrolytes are due to a true thermo-electric action--that is
to Bay, to an absorption of heat only, especially as Mr. Wild could find no
trace of the Peltier heating and cooling effect at the junctions of his solutions.
Further research, showing the source of the power developed, is most de-

 sirable.

    While .consulting the literature connected with this subject, I found that

Gaugain had to some extent preceded me in the discovery of the loose-con-
tact currents, in a paper published in the ' Comptes Eendus ' in 1S53. He

comes to the same conclusion as I had done independently, that they were
due to the unequally heated film of foreign matter, and places oxide of iron
below platinum, and oxide of copper above gold and zinc, but below iron,

instead of very much above it as I find. He does not appear to have ob-

served the exceedingly high electromotive force to be obtained from these
bodies, no doubt owing to the use of a short galvanometer coil of thick wires,

such as is commonly used for thermo-electric researches. He introduces a

carburet of iron, of which I find no trace, with more positive properties than

oxide of copper, to explain some of his results. He gives very few data on

which to found his theory, but simply mentions his conclusions, and appears
to have made no direct experiment whatever with the oxides. Owing to
these circumstances his experiments seem to have attracted little attention.
I have endeavoured to contrive a convenient apparatus by which to study the

properties of the oxides, but have not hitherto met with much success, owing

to the great difficulty in maintaining a constant difference of temperature
between the surfaces of the veiy thin film, which can alone be used with

success. Xext year I hope to obtain further residts in elucidation of these

quasi thermo-electric currents from electrolytes.

   I now wish to add a few remarks on the currents which occur when true
metallic contact is made between a hot and cold end of a wire of one metal.
The existence of these currents was placed beyond all doubt by Magnus's
careful experiments, but their connexion with other thermo-electric phenomena
has hitherto remained entirely without explanation. Wild has suggested

that they might be due to a thermo-electric couple formed with hot air or gas

at the moment of junction ; but experiments which I have made show this

explanation to be founded on a mistaken conception of the duration of the
current, which is by no means instantaneous, but lasts at least five minutes
with copper or with iron wires, very gradually decreasing in intensity from

a maximum to zero.

    Another explanation, viz. that the deflection is due to a sort of discharge
of a statical effect produced by the unequal distribution of heat, is also nega-
tived by the same consideration, as well as by the fact that a tension of suffi-
cient magnitude to produce such a charge could not possibly have escaped

observation by direct measurement.

      ON THERMO-ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CIRCUITS OF ONE METAL. 177

Heat,' that if the condition, of metal at a certain temperature depended ex-
clusively on that temperature, no distribution or movement of heat could
possibly give rise to a current of electricity in a circuit of one metal ; never-
theless I find, as above stated, that in a circuit of one metal wire a current

is maintained for five minutes at a time, gradually vanishing to nothing when

the two ends of the homogeneous wire have been for some time in contact, but
rocommeucing if one wire is cooled for a minute and then again applied to
the hot one. One explanation of this might be that the condition of the
wires does not solely depend on their temperature, but is influenced to a con-
siderable extent by the time during which they have remained at that tem-
perature. Nor is this a gratuitous assumption : Dr. Matthiessen has proved
that wires of several metals do not attain a constant conducting power until
they have been kept for some time at a constant temperature ; he finds that
the conducting power of bismuth increases, while that of tellurium decreases

when kept for a time at 100°. Quite similarly, some metals may rise and
some may fall in the thermo-electric scale after being heated for some time, a
supposition which is necessary to account for the metallic contact currents by

the theory I suggest.

   Another possible explanation of the metallic contact currents may be found

in a partial hardening on the one. side and annealing on the other, caused
by the sudden contact of the hot and cold metal. If this be so, the current
between annealed and unannealed wires of the same metal would correspond

with the contact current between two homogeneous wires, in a way which it

does not seem to do.

   I am, however, now engaged in investigating this subject, and hope before
next year to be able to give facts which may decide whether either of these

theories is tenable. There is great difficulty in forming any conclusion from
experiments hitherto made, inasmuch as none of the observers, except
Dr. Matthiessen, have used chemically pure metal, and it is found that the
electrical properties of a metal are affected to an extraordinary degree by the
presence of impurities in very small quantities.

                        Explanation of tlie Tahle.

The names of the metals of which the loops were made are entered at the

side and top of the Table. The experiments made with each combination are

entered in the subdivision at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical

columns corresponding to the two metals. The nietals named at the top

formed the right-hand loop, those at the side the left-hand loop. The arrows
show the direction of the current across the joint. The first entiy in each

subdivision shows the deflection observed when the right-hand metal was

heated and the wires held loosely together. The second entry shows the

deflection when the same metal was heated but the wires drawn tightly

together.

   The third entry gives the maximum deflection, and the direction of the
current, when the middle of the joint is gradually heated and the two wires

held tightly together.

The fourth entry (where given) shows the maximum deflection from a

current in the opposite direction when greater heat was applied. The two

last entries show the common well-known metallic thermo-electric effects.

The first entry shows the new loose-contact effect. The second entry shows

an uncertain combined effect of metallic and imperfect contact effects.

  An example will perhaps make this clearer. When copper and iron were

used and copper loop heated, a loose contact produced a current from copper

Ato iron across the joint, giving a deflection of 100 divisions.  tight contact

gave nothing decided. When the iron loop was heated (the copper cold) the

loose contact produced a current from iron to copper across the joint, giving

Aa deflection of 90 divisions.  tight contact in this case gave a weak current

in the opposite direction. "When the joint was heated in the middle, as the

temperature gradually rose, a maximum deflection of 3 divisions was first

reached, showing a current from copper to iron across the joint ; and as the

heat increased still further this current was reversed, and finally, at a white

heat, gave a maximum deflection of 3 divisions with a current from iron to

copper.

On the Mechanical Properties of Iron Projectiles at High Velocities.

                         By W. Fairbairn, F.R.S.

A valuable series of experiments were made at Manchester upon portions of

plates fired at by the Iron Plate Committee at Shoeburyness. These expert
ments comprised the determination of the resistance to punching, to a tensile
strain, to impact, and to pressure.

   They show that the tenacity varied from 11 to 29 tons per square inch in
the iron plates, and from 26 to 33| tons in the homogeneous iron plates. The
average strength of the iron plates between lg and 3 inches thick varied

from 23| to 24^ tons per square inch, and this, or about 21 tons, may proba-

bly be insisted upon as a measure of strength in future contracts for iron

plates.

   The elongation of the plates under a tensile strain may be taken as a mea-

sure of the ductility of the material ; it varied in the thicker iron plates from
0-91 to 0-27 per unit of length, and averaged 0-27 inch in the homogeneous

metal plates. The maximum observed was 0-35.

   The most important results in connexion with the question of the resist-
ance are, however, those obtained by combining the tensile breaking weight
with the ultimate elongation, as first indicated by Mr. Mallet in a paper read
before the Institution of Civil Engineers. By finding in this manner the
product of the tenacity and ductility, numbers are obtained which, though not

identical with those expressing the resistance of the plates in the experiments
with guns at Shoeburyness, are yet in close correspondence with them. The
average value for Mr. Mallet's coefficient in the thicker iron plates was about
6500 lbs., and in the steel or homogeneous plates 8300 lbs. But the resist-
ance of the iron plates increases with the thickness, whilst that of the homo-
geneous metal diminishes. The correspondence of these numbers is indicated

in the Eeport addressed to the War Office and the Admiralty ; but a more

extended series of experiments are yet wanting to determine the true value
 of the coefficient as a guide to be insisted upon iu the manufacture of iron

plates. 9000 foot-pounds is the maximum for iron given by the 'results
already obtained ; but an extended series of experiments might develope new
features of resistance and new improvements in the manufacture.

    The experiments on punching afford an explanation of the greatly increased
perforating power of the flat-headed shot over- that of the round-headed
projectiles. They also lead to a formula for the ordinary cast-iron service
shot, which appears to give with approximate accuracy the law of the resist-

ance of plates of different thicknesses to missiles of various weights and velo-

cities.

    These investigations led to inquiries into the state of the manufacture of

plates calculated to resist heavy and powerful projectiles directed against the
sides of an iron-plated ship, and, moreover, to determine the exact thickness
of plates that a vessel was able to carry. Again, they had reference to the
quality of the plates and their powers of resistance to impact. There were
three conditions necessary to be observed in the manufacture : 1st, that the
material should be soft and ductile ; 2nd, that it shoidd be of great tenacity
and, lastly, that it should be fibrous and tough. All these conditions apply
to the manufacture of plates, and they also apply, with equal force, to the
projectiles in their resistance to pressure and impact.

   In the experiments at Shoebiiryness, it was found that the ordinary cast-
iron service shot were not adapted for penetration, as they invariably broke
into fragments when discharged against a sufficiently thick armour-plate. In
most cases when delivered at high velocities, they had the power of damaging
and breaking the plates ; but owing to their crystalline character and defective
tenacity, a considerable portion of the power was expended in their own
destruction. To some extent the same law was applicable to wrought-iron
shot, as part of the force, from its greater ductility, was employed in distorting
its form, and depriving it of its powers to penetrate the plate. Cast and
wrought iron are therefore inferior as a material for projectiles intended to
be employed against iron-plated ships and forts. With steel hardened at the
end the case is widely different, as its tenacity is not only much greater than
that of cast and wrought iron, but the process of hardening the head prevents
compression and its breaking up by the blow when the whole of its force is
delivered upon the plate. Steel, although much superior to cast or wrought
iron in its power of resistance in the shape of shot, is, nevertheless, suscep-
tible of distortion and compression, and in every instance when employed
against powerful resisting targets the compression, and consequently the dis-
tortion, was distinctly visible.

    There is another consideration besides the material which enters largely
into the question of the resisting powers of shot, and that is form. It will
be recollected that, some years since, the late Professor Hodgkiiison instituted
a series of experiments to determine the strength of iron pillars, and the
results obtained were in the following ratios :

                                                                        lbs.

Nowbeing in the ratio of 1, 2, 3.    in order to ascertain the effects of form

on cylindrical shot, a series of experiments were instituted to determine the

force of impact and statical pressure produced upon shot of different shapes,

and from these experiments the following results were obtained.

The description of shot experimented upon was cast-iron of the cylindrical

form, with flat and round ends ; and it is interesting to observe that the re-

sults correspond with those where both ends are rounded and one end only

rounded, as obtained by Mr. Hodgkiiison on long columns ; but in the short

specimens with both ends rounded the results are widely different, as may

be seen by the following Table.

                                                                        n2

inflicts greatly increased punishment upon it. In this instance the amount
of -work done is in favour of the wrought iron : but this does not alter the
condition in which tho force was first delivered upon the target ; on the con-
trary, it is entirely due to the superior tenacity of wrought iron to that of
cast iron, which yields to the blow, and is broken to pieces in consequence of

its inferior powers of resistance. The same may be said of steel in a much

higher degree, which delivers nearly the whole of its vis viva upon the plate.
    In the foregoing experiments it will be observed that the resistance of cast-

iron flat-ended shot to a crushing force is about 55 tons per square inch,

whilst in the two following we find that the round-ended specimens, of the
same material, gave way and were crushed with a pressure of only 26| tons

rather less than one-half the force required to crush the flat-ended ones. It
is a curious but interesting fact (provided the same law governs the force of
impact as dead pressure) that the round-ended projectile which strikes tho
target should lose, from shape alone, one-half its powers of resistance. This

may be accounted for as under.

   Take, for example, a cylinder of cast iron, «, with a rounded end forcibly
pressed against the steel plate A, -until it
is crushed by a fixed law of fracture ob-

servable in every description of crystalline
structure; that is, the rounded end or

part s forms itself into a cone, which,

acting as a wedge, splits off the sides c c

in every direction at the angle of least
resistance, and these, sliding along the
sides of the cone, are broken to pieces on

the surface of the plate.

   At Shoeburyness the same results were

observable in all the experiments with
spherical and round-ended shot, each of
them following precisely the same law. In every case where the shot was
broken to pieces, the fractured parts took the same direction, forming a cone

or central core similar to that shown at s, as exhibited in my own experi-

ments on statical pressure with the round-ended cylindrical shot.
   The law of fracture of cast iron has been carefully investigated by the lato

Professor Hodgkinson in his paper on the strength of pillars, to which we
have referred. It is there clearly shown that the resistance of columns
when broken by compression is in the ratio of 1, 2, and 3 ; the middle one,
with only one end rounded, being an arithmetical mean between the other

two. Now these important facts, according to all appearance, bear directly

upon the forms necessary to be observed in the manufacture of projectiles, as

we find cylindrical shot with round ends loses one-half its powers of resist-

ance to a pressure or a blow which tends to rupture or to break it in pieces.

  My own experiments given above do not exactly agree with those of Pro-

--fessor Hodgkinson the ratio of resistance in a column with one end rounded,
--and that of a column with both ends flat, being as 3 : 1*5, instead of as 3 : 2

as in his experiments, a discovery probably explained by considering that

he employed cast-iron pillars from 20 to 30 diameters in length, whereas my

own were only two diameters long. Professor Hodgkinson has, indeed, ex-

pressed an opinion that the difference of the strengths of the three forms of
pillars becomes less according as the number of times the length of the pillar
exceeds the diameter decreases, which is the reverse of the results obtained in

the foregoing experiments. JBut on this I may observe, that the conclusion
182 KEPOET 1862.

is founded on a very limited number of experiments on wrought-iron columns

of 15 to 30 diameters long as compared with others of 60 diameters, which,

in my opinion, has been prematurely assumed as a general law. With wrought

iron especially, the crushing-up of the rounded ends would soon bring pillars

of that form into the condition of flat-ended pillars when the breaking weight

--approached the ultimate strength of the material a conclusion confirmed by

observing that the experiments in question are exactly those in Mr. Hodg-

kinson's table in which the breaking weights of the pillars are greatest.

However this may be, the experiments I have given show that short cylinders

with flat ends have twice the strength of similar cylinders with one end

rounded. From this it would appear that the law for short cylinders is not
the same, but altogether different from that obtained by Mr. Hodgkinson

for long cylinders.

   The discrepancies which appeared to exist between my own experiments

and those of Professor Hodgkinson induced me still further to inquire into

the law which seems to govern short bolts of columns of two diameters

in length. To account for those discrepancies, the experiments were extended

to columns with both ends rounded ; and what renders them interesting is,

that in short columns with both ends rounded the powers of resistance are

nearly the same as those with one end flat and one end rounded, and moreover

they appear to follow a different law from that of Professor Hodgkinson's long

columns, which, in most cases, broke by flexure.

The difference in strength between short columns with both ends rounded

and those with one end flat and one end rounded is almost inappreciable, as

will be seen by comparing their values as under :

                                                   Tons per square inch.

Columns of two diameters long with flat ends crushed with 54-82

Columns with one end rounded and one flat          ,, ,, 26-86

Columns with both ends rounded                     ,, ,, 23-88

So that the difference between them may be taken as the numbers 55, 27,

and 24, or, in other words, in the ratio of 1 : -49 with one end rounded and

-- --one end flat that with both ends flat representing unity and as 1 : -44 with

both ends rounded ; a comparatively slight difference between those with one

end flat and the others with both ends rounded.
   With regard to the dynamic effect, or work done, by round-ended shot as

compared with flat-ended ones, it has already been shown that with dead pres-
sure the indentations produced on wrought-iron plates by a round-ended shot
are nearly 3| times greater than by those with the flat ends, and that the
work done is twice as great in the case of the round ends as compared with

that by the flat ends. This may be accounted for by rounded shot striking

the plate with itsj pointed end, and the force of the blow being given by a

comparatively small area ; the vis viva or

the whole force is thus concentrated and

driven into the target to a depth consider-

ably greater than if spread over the whole
area of the projectile. The flat-ended

cylindrical shot, which indicates such

powerful resistance to pressure, is gene-
rally fractured by one or more of its sides
being forced downwards in the direction

of the line a, and hence its superior resist-

ance when the whole area of the cylinder
forms the base as the means of support.
          ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OP IRON PROJECTILES. 183

The difference of form does not, however, lessen the quantity of mechanical
force (the weights being the same), as each ball has the same work stored in it
when delivered from the gun at the same velocity, and the blow upon the
target ought to be the same in effect but for the difference of shape in the case
of the round ends, which break to pieces with one-half the pressure.

   It is difficult to estimate the difference of force or work done upon the target
by the two balls ; it is certainly not in the ratio of their relative tenacities
(the metal being the same), but arising from form, as the one would strike
the target with its whole sectional area in the shape of a punch adapted for
perforation, whilst the other, although much easier fractured, would effect a
deeper indentation upon the plate.

   The same law of defective resistance is observable in wrought iron and
steel as is indicated in cast iron, but not to the same extent. On com-
paring the mean of twenty-six experiments on wrought iron with those
on cast iron, it is evident that the difference between the two is considerable
in their respective powers of resistance to compression. In the experiments
on cast iron the specimens were invariably broken into fragments, and those
of wrought iron, although severely crushed, were not destroyed. The same
law, however, appears to be in operation in regard to the flat- and the round-
ended specimens, although less in that of wrought iron, as both forms were
squeezed so as to be no longer useful, the ratios being as 75 : 50 nearly, or
100 : 07-4. The round-ended shot, as might be expected, supported con-
siderably more than one-half the pressure applied to the flat-ended one before
it was finally distorted, whilst the cast iron was broken with less than one-
half the pressure required to crush the flat-ended specimens. From these
and the experiments on impact, there cannot exist a doubt as to the damaging

effects of wrought-iron projectiles.

   The experiments on steel indicate similar results to those on cast and

wrought iron, as may be seen from the mean of nineteen experiments given
in the following summary of results :

parative values are as follows :

   From the experiments on the wrought iron, the flat-ended steel specimens,
and the lead, no definite conclusion was arrived at, the material being more
or less compressed without the appearance of fracture. The mean resistance

of the cast iron is 800 foot-pounds per square inch, whilst that of steel is
2515 foot-pounds, or more than three times as much. The conditions which
appear to be derivable from these facts, in order that the greatest amount of

--force may be expended oa the iron plate, are therefore : Yery high statical

resistance to rupture by compression. In this respect wrought iron and steel
are both superior to cast iron ; in fact, the statical resistance of steel is more
than three times that of cast iron, and more than two and a half times that
of wrought iron. Lead is inferior to all the other materials experimented
upon in this respect. Again, resistance to change of form under severe
pressure and impact is an important element in the material of shot. In this
respect hardened steel is infinitely superior to wrought iron. Cast iron is
inferior to both. In fact, the shot which would produce the greatest damage
on armour-plates would be one of adamant, incapable of change of form, and
perfect in its powers of resistance to impact. Such a shot "would yield up the
-whole of its vis viva on the plate struck, and, so far as experiment yet proves,
those projectiles which approach nearest to that condition are the most

effective.

Report on the Progress of the Solution of certain Special Problems of

  Dynamics. By A. Cayley, F.R.S., Correspondent of the Institute.

My "Report on the Recent Progress of Theoretical Dynamics" was pub-

lished in the Report of the British Association for the year 1857. The
present Report (-which is in some measure supplemental thereto) relates to
the Special Problems of Dynamics : to give a general idea of the contents, I
wiU at once mention the heads under which these problems are considered
viz., relating to the motion of a particle or system of particles, wc have

       Rectilinear Motion
       Central Forces, and in particular

       Elliptic Motion ;

       Rotation of a Solid Body

       Kinematics of a Solid Body

         Miscellaneous Problems.

    As regards the first division of the subject, I remark that the lunar and

planetary theories, as usually treated, do not (properly speaking) relate to the

--problem of three bodies, but to that of disturbed elliptic motion a problem

which is not considered in the present Report. The problem of the spherical
pendulum is that of a particle moving on a spherical surface ; but, with this
exception, I do not much consider the motion of a particle on a given curve
or surface, nor the motion in a resisting medium ; what is said on these
subjects is included under the head Miscellaneous Problems. The first six
heads relate exclusively, and the head Miscellaneous Problems relates princi-
pally to the motion of a single particle. As regards the second division of
the subject, I will only remark that, from its intimate connexion with the
theory of the motion of a solid body, I have been induced to make a separate
head of the geometrical subject, " Transformation of Coordinates," and to treat

of it in considerable detail.

    I have inserted at the end of the present Report a list of the memoirs and
works referred to, arranged (not, as in the former Report, in chronological order,
but) alphabetically according to the authors' names : those referred to in the
former Report formed for the purpose thereof a single series, which is not
here the case. The dates specified are for the most part those on the title-
page of the volume, being intended to show approximately the date of the
researches to which they refer, but in some instances a moi»e particular speci-
fication is made.

 ^ I take the opportunity of noticing a serious omission in my former Report,

viz., I have not made mention of the elaborate memoir, Ostrogradsky,
" Memoire sur les equations clifferentielles relatives au probleme des Isope'ri-
metres," Me'm. de St. Pet. t. iv. (6 se'r.) pp. 385-517, 1850, which among other
researches contains, and that in the most general form, the transformation of
the equations of motion from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian form, and

indeed the transformation of the general isoperimetric system (that is, the
                                                                  _

system arising from any problem in the calculus of variations) to" the Hamil-
tonian form. I remark also, as regards the memoir of Cauchy referred to in
the note p. 12 as an unpublished memoir of 1831, there is an " Extrait du
Memoire presente a l'Academie de Turin le 11 Oct. 1831," published in

The Extract begins thus : " § I. Variation des Constantes Arbitraires. Soient

             Rectilinear Motion, Article Nos. 1 to 5.

    1. The determination of the motion of a falling body, which is the case of

a constant force, is due to Galileo.

  A2. variable force, assumed to be a force depending only on the position

of the particle, may be considered as a function of the distance from any

point in the line, selected at pleasure as a centre of force ; but if, as usual,
the force is given as a function of the distance from a certain point, it is

natural to take that point for the centre of force. Tbe problem thus becomes

a particular case of that of central forces ; and it is so treated in the ' Principia,'
Book I. § 7; the method has the advantage of explaining the paradoxical
result which presents itself in the case Force OC (Dist.) -2 , and in some other
cases where the force becomes infinite. According to theory, the velocity
becomes infinite at the centre, but the direction of the motion is there
abruptly reversed ; so that the body in its motion does not pass through the

centre, but on arriving there, forthwith returns towards its original position
of course such a motion cannot occur in nature, where neither a force nor a

velocity ever is actually infinite.

   3. Analytically the problem may be treated separately by means of the

d?x                                                               /clx\*       /*

4. The following cases may be mentioned :

   Force OC Dist. The law of motion is well known, being in fact the same
       as for the cycloidal pendulum.

Assuming that the body falls from rest at a distance a, we have

                                       A'r=«(l-- cos<£),

If the body had initially a small transverse velocity, the motion woiild be in a
very excentric ellipse, and the formulae are in fact the limiting form of those

for elliptic motion.

   5. There are various laws of force for which the motion may be determined.

In particular it can be determined by means of Elliptic Integrals, in the case
of a body attracted to two centres, force OC (dist.) -2 : see Legendre, Exercices

   7. 1\ is to be noticed that, given the orbit, the law of force is at once
determined ; and § 2 contains several instances of such determination ; thus,

   Prop. VII. If a body revolve in a circle, the law of force to a point S is

force oc gp2 fy3 (P the body, PV the chord through S).

   Prop. IX. If a body move in a logarithmic spiral, force oc (dist.)- 3 .
   Prop. X. If a body move in an ellipse, force to centre OC dist., and as a parti-
cular case, if the body move in a parabola under the action of a force

parallel to the axis, the force is constant. The particular case of motion in

a parabola had been obtained by Galileo.

XLAnd § 3. Props.                               XII. XIII. If a body move in an ellipse, hyperbola, or

parabola under the action of a force tending to the focus, force OC (dist.) -2.

8. But Newton had no direct method of solving the inverse problem

(which depends on the solution of the differential equation), "Given the

force to find the orbit." Thus force OC (dist.)- 2, after it has been shown that
an ellipse, a hyperbola, and a parabola may each of them be described under

the action of such a force. The remainder of the solution consists in showing

that, given the initial circumstances of the motion, a conic section (ellipse,

parabola, or hyperbola, as the case may be) can be constructed, passing through

the point of projection, having its tangent in the direction of the initial
motion, and such that the velocity of the body describing the conic section

under the action of the given central force is equal to the velocity of pro-

jection                            which being  so, the  orbit will be  the  conic  section  so constructed.
                                ;

This is what is done, Prop. XVII. ; it may be observed that the latus rectum

is constructed not very elegantly by means of the latus rectum of an

auxiliary orbit.

  A9. more elegant construction was obtained by Cotes (see the ' Harmonia

Mensurarum,' pp. 103-105, and demonstration from the author's papers in
the Notes by R. Smith, pp. 124, 125), depending on the position of a point C,
such that the velocity acquired in falling under the action of the central

force from C directly or through infinity* to P the point of projection, is equal

to the given velocity of projection.

   10. But Newton's original construction is now usually replaced by a con-

struction which employs the space due to the velocity of projection considered

as produced by a constant force equal to the central force at the point of pro-

jection.

   11. Section 9 of Book I. relates to revolving orbits, viz., it is shown that
a body may be made to move in an orbit revolving round the centre of force,

   * In the second case C lies on the radius vector produced beyond the centre, and the
body is supposed to fall from rest at C (under the action of the central force considered as

repulsive) to infinity, and then from the opposite infinity (with an initial velocity equal
to the velocity so acquired) to P.

they contain exponential in the place of circular functions (see post, Elliptic
Motion).

   18. Euler, in the memoir " Determinatio Orbitae Cometaa Anni 1742,"
(1743), p. 16 et seq., obtained an expression for the time of describing a para-
bolic arc in terms of the radius vectors and the chord ; viz. these being /, g,
and h, the expression is

Time =-                 (f+9+A%- (f+ff-^,

         6 V>

which, however, as remarked by Lagrange, ' Mec. Anal.' t. xi. (3rd edit. p. 28),

is deducible from Lemma X. of the third book of the < Principia.' But the

theorem in its actual form is due to Euler.

   19. Lambert, in the « Proprietates Insigniores, &c.' (1761), Theorem VII.
Cor. 2, obtained the same theorem, and in section 4 he obtained the corre-
sponding theorem for elliptic motion ; viz. the expression for the time is

The form of the formula is, it will be observed, similar to that for motion in
a straight line (antt, No. 4), and in fact the motion in the ellipse is, by an
ingenious geometrical transformation, made to depend upon that in the

straight line. The geometrical theorems upon which the transformation

depends are stated, Cayley " On Lambert's Theorem &c." (1861).

   20. The theorem was also obtained by Lagrange in the memoir " Be-
cherches &c." (1767) as a corollary to his solution of the problem of two
centres ; viz. upon making the attractive force of one of the centres equal to

zero, and assuming that such centre is situate on the curve, the expression for

the time presents itself in the form given by Lambert's theorem.

   21. Two other demonstrations of the theorem are given by Lagrange in

the memoir " Sur une maniere particuliere d'exprimer le temps &c." (1778),
reproduced in Note V. of the second volume of the last edition (Bertrand's) of

the ' Mecanique Analytique.' As M. Bertrand remarks, these demonstrations

are very complete, very elegant, and very natural, assuming that the theorem

is known beforehand.
   Demonstrations were also given by Gauss, " Theoria Motus " (1809), p. 119

etseq.; Pagani, "Demonstration d'un theoreme ifcc." (1834); and (in con-

nexion with Hamilton's principal function) by Sir W. E. Hamilton, " On a

General Method &c." (1834), p. 282; Jacobi, "Zur Tbeorie &c." (1837),.
p. 122 ; Cayley, « Note on the Theory of Elliptic Motion " (1856).

   22. Connected with the problem of central forces, we have Sir W. B.

Hamilton's ' Hodograph,' which in the paper (Proc. E. Irish Acad. 1847) is

defined, and the fundamental properties stated ; viz. if in an orbit round a

eentre of force there be taken on the perpendicular from the centre on the

tangent at each point, a length equal to the velocity at that point of the orbit,

the extremities of these lengths will trace out a curve which is the hodograph.

As the product of the velocity into the perpendicular on the tangent is equal

to twice the area swept out in a unit of time (i^=7i), the hodograph is the

reciprocal polar of the orbit with respect to a circle described about the centre

=of force, radius \/h. "Whence also the tangent at any point of the hodo-

graph is perpendicular to the radius vector through the corresponding point

of the orbit, and the product of the perpendicular on the tangent into the

corresponding radius vector is =h.

    If force oc (dist.) -2 , the hodograph, qua reciprocal polar of a conic section

with respect to a circle described about the focus, is a circle.

    23. The following theorem is also given without demonstration ; viz. if two

circular hodographs, which have a common chord passing or tending through

a common centre of force, be both cut at right angles by a third circle, the

times of hodographically describing the intercepted arcs (that is, the times of

describing the corresponding elliptic arcs) will be equal.

   24. Droop, " On the Isoehronism &c." (1856), shows geometrically that

the last-mentioned property is equivalent to Lambert's theorom ; and an

Aanalytical demonstration is also given, Cayley, " demonstration of Sir W.

B. Hamilton's Theorem &c." (1857). See also Sir W. B. Hamilton's < Lec-

tures on Quaternions ' (1853), p. 614.

+ _+ + Dlaws of force, e. g. -A±Br, A_ B C      are considered by Legendre,

" Theorie des Fonctions EUiptiques " (1825), being such as lead to results

--expressible by elliptic integrals, and also the law , for which the result in-
                                                                                       r

volves a peculiar logarithmic integral. But the most elaborate examination
of the different cases in which the solution can be worked out by elliptic

integrals or otherwise is given in Stader's memoir " De Orbitis &c." (1852)>

where the investigation is conducted by means of the formulas which give
t and 6* in terms of r (ante, No. 14).

   26. In speaking of a central force, it is for the most part implied that the
force is a function of the distance : for some problems in which this is not
the case, see pos£, Miscellaneous Problems, Nos. 86 and 87.

   It is to be noticed that, although the problem of central forces may be (as

it has so far been) considered as a problem in piano (viz. the plane of the

motion has been made the plane of reference), yet that it is also interesting to
consider it as a problem in space ; in fact, in this case the integrals, though
of course involved in those which belong to the plane problem, present them-
selves under veiy distinct forms, and afford interesting applications of the
theory of canonical integrals, the derivation of the successive integrals by
Poisson's method, and of other general dynamical theories. Moreover, in
the lunar and planetary theories, the problem must of necessity be so treated.
Without going into any details on this point, I will refer to Bertrand's
memoir " Sur les equations differentielles de la Mecanique " (1852), Donkin's

memoir "On a Class of Differential Equations &e." (1855), and Jacobi's pos-

thumous memoir, " Nova Methodus &c." (1862).

   27. The question of the development of the true anomaly in terms of the
mean anomaly (Kepler's problem), and of the other developments which pre-

sent themselves in the theory of elliptic motion, is one that has very much
occupied the attention of geometers. The formulas on which it depends are

mentioned ante, No. 15 ; they involve as an auxiliary quantity the excentric
anomaly u.

28. Consider first the equation

                               --<7=w c sin u,

which connects the mean anomaly g with the excentric anomaly u.

Any  function  of u,  and  in  particular  u  itself,  and  the                                                             functions  cs   nu  mavJ

                                                                                                                                       sin

be expanded in terms of g by means of Lagrange's theorem (Lagrange, * Me'm

Eesolution des equations Numeriques," Note 11).

  We30. have next Bessel's investigations in the Berlin Memoirs for 181 G,

18X8, and 1824, and which are carried on mainly by means of the integral

                        = fh 2ir

and various properties are there obtained and applications made of this im-

portant transcendant.

   31. Relating to this integral we have Jacobi's memoir, "Eormulce trans-

formationis &c." (1836), Liouville, « Sur l'integrale I "cos i (u--x sin u) du"

(1841), and Hansen's "Ermittelung der absoluton Storungen" (1843); the
researches of Poisson in the ' Connaissance des Temps ' for 1825 and 1836 arc

closely connected with those of Bessel.

  A32. very elegant formula, giving the actual expression of the coefficients

considered as functions of e and X, is given by Grcatheed in the paper " Inves-

tigation of the General Term &c." (1838) ; viz. this is

         ^ ^y^f=rj + 2^{e^+ + X- re-^+                   V

                                                               3

where, after developing in powers of X, the negative powers of X must be
rejected, and the term independent of X divided by 2. This result is ex-

tended to other functions of/, Cayley "On certain Expansions &c." (1842).

   33. An expression for the coefficient of the general term as a function of e

only is obtained, Lcfort, " Expression Numerique &c." (1846). The expres-

sion, which, from the nature of the case, is a very complicated one, is obtained
by means of Bessel's integral. This is an indirect process which really comes

to the combination of the developments of / in terms of u, and « in terms of

g; and an equivalent result is obtained directly in this manner, Greedy,
" General and Practical Solution &c." (1855).

   We34. have also on the subject of these developments the very valuable

and interesting researches of Hansen, contained in his « Fundamenta Nova,

&c.' (1838), in the memoir "Ermittelung der absoluten Storungen &c/'

(1845), and in particular in the memoir " Entwickelung des Products &c"

(1853).

                                                                  COS

  37. The true anomaly / has been repeatedly calculated to a much greater

as     20  The  expression             for  -  as  far  as   u  is  given  in   the  same   work,      and  that

    38. It may be remarked that when the motion of a body is referred to a

plane which is not the plane of the elliptic orbit, then we have questions of

development similar in some measure to those which regard the motion in the

orbit ; if, for instance, z be the distance from node, cj> the inclination, and x

the reduced distance from node, then cosz=cos<pcos.r, from which we may

derive z=x-\- series of multiple sines of as. And there are, moreover, the

questions connected with the development of the reciprocal distance of two
-- --particles
             say  (a 2              2  --2aa'  cosd)~*      which present themselves in the pla-

                        -\-a'

netary theory ; but this last is a wide subject, which I do not here enter

upon. I will, however, just refer to Hansen's memoir, " Ueber die Entwicke-

lung der negativen und uugeraden Potenzen &c." (1854).

    39. The question of the convergence of the series is treated in Laplace's

memoir of 1823, where he shows that in the series which express r and /in

                                                                                                            os

multiple cosines or sines of g, the coefficient of a term . ig, where i is very

great, is at most equal in absolute value to a quantity of the form *--r:( -),

A and \ being finite quantities independent of i, whence he concludes that,

in order to the convergency of the series, the limiting value of the excentricity

is e=X, the numerical value being =0-66195.
   40. The following important theorem was established by Cauchy, as part

of a theoiy of the convergence of series in general ; viz. so long as e is less
than 0-6627432, which is the least modulus of e for which the equations

                                       =7T

can be satisfied, the development of the true anomaly and other developments

in the theory of elliptic motion will be convergent. This was first given in

1862.                                                                                               o

' Mecanique Analytique ' (1855). There are on this subject, and on subjects
connected with it, several papers by Cauchy in the · Comptes Rendus,' 1840
et seq., which need not be particularly referred to.

            The Problem of tiuo Centres, Article Nos. 41 to 64.

   41. The original problem is that of the motion of a body acted upon by
forces tending to two centres, and varying inversely as the squares of the
distances ; but, as will be noticed, the solutions apply with but little variation
to more general laws of force.

   42. It may be convenient to notice that the coordinates made use of (in

the several solutions) for determining the position of the body, are either the

sum and difference of the two radius vectors, or else quantities which are
respectively functions of the sum and the difference of these radius vectors*.

If the plane of the motion is not given, then there is a third coordinate,
which is the inclination of the plane through the body and the two centres
to a fixed plane through the two centres, or say the azimuth of the axial
plane, or simply the azimuth.

   43. Calling the first-mentioned two coordinates r and s, and the azimuth \p,
the solution of the problem leads ultimately to equations of the form

            dr els          _ \dr ^ds                             pdr ads

Rwhere and S are rational and integral functions (of the third or fourth

degree, in the case of forces varying as (dist.) -2) of r, s respectively (but
they are not in general the same functions of r, s respectively) ; \ and p are
simple rational functions of r, and fi and a simple rational functions of s ; so

that the equations give by quadratures, the first of them the curve described

in the axial plane, the second the position of the body in this curve at a given
time, and the third of them the position of the axial plane. In the ordinary

Rcase, where and S are each of them of the third or the fourth order, the

quadratures depend on elliptic integrals t ; but on account of the presence in

the formulae of the two distinct radicals VR> \Zs> it would appear that the

solutionis not susceptible of an ulterior development by means of elliptic and
Jacobian functions f similar to those obtained in the problems of Rotation and
the Spherical Pendulum.

   44. It has just been noticed that when R, S are each of them of the fourth
order, the quadratures depend on elliptic integrals ; in the particular cases

mthe same functions of r, s respectively, and and n being integers (or more

generally for other relations between the forms of R, S given by the theory
of elliptic integrals), the equation admits of algebraical integration ; but as

the relations in question do not in general hold good, the theory of the
algebraical integration of the equations plays only a secondary part in the

solution of the problem. It is, however, proper td remark that Euler, when
he wrote his first two memoirs " On the Problem of the two Centres " (post,
Nos. 45 and 46), had already discovered and was acquainted with the theory

   45. Having made these preliminary remarks, I come to the history of the

problem.

   It is I think clear that Eider's earliest memoir is the one " De Motu Corporis

etc." in the Petersburg Memoirs for 1764 (printed 1766). In this memoir
the forces vary as (disk)-*, and the body moves in a given plane. The
equations of motion are taken to be

which, if £, ,, are the inclinations of the distances v, u to the axis respectively

(sec foot-note to No. 42), lead to

              V = ++v d£ dtj 2gadf (A cos £ B cos >? D),

where D, E are constants of integration. Substituting for v, u their values in

terms of rj, £ and eliminating dt, Euler obtains .

                Acos£+Bcosj;+D                               = Q.

And he then enters into a very interesting discussion of the particular case

            °r   *° ^nz ' the Case where one of the  attracting  masses vanishes,
                of course known to be integrable);               arriving at some

paradoxical conclusions which he does not completely explain, although he
remarks that the explanation depends on the circumstance that the integral
lound is a singular solution of a derivative equation, and as such does not
satisty the original equations of motion,--he proceeds to notice that an
inquiry into the cause of the difficulty led him to a substitution by which
the variables were separated.

at once, without explaining how he was led to it, the analytical investigation

of the substitution in question, viz. in each of the two memoirs he in fast

writes

and in terms of these quantities p, q, the equation becomes

                 dp dq

where

         P=( A + B + D)i> + 2Ep8 + (-A-B + D)y,

which are the formulae for the solution of the problem, as obtained in Euler's

first and second memoirs.

   47. In his third memoir, viz. that " De Motu Corporis &c." in the Petersburg

Memoirs for 1765 (printed 1707), Euler considers the body as moving in
space, the forces being as before as (dist.) -2 . Assuming that the coordinates

y, z are in the plane perpendicular to the axis, there is in this case

         dz d\i
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ..

+that is, y'=*/y2 z2, and \p the azimuth, the integral equations for the

motion in the variable plane (coordinates x, y') are not materially different in
form from those which belong to the motion in a fixed plane, coordinates x, y
(see post, No. 56, Jacobi) ; and the last-mentioned equation, which reduces

                                             dd>

itself to the form y'2 -rr=const., gives at once d\p in a form such as that

above alluded to (ante, No. 43), and therefore \p by quadratures. The
variables employed by Euler in the memoir in question are

         + v--v u,  u (say r, s) and \p,

v, u being, as above, the distances from the two centres, and \js the azimuth

of the axial plane. The functions of r, s under the radical signs are

of the fourth order ; this is so, with these variables, even if the motion

is in a fixed plane ; but this is no disadvantage, since, as is well known, the

case of a quartic radical is not really more complicated than that of a cubic

radical, the two forms being immediately convertible the one into the other.

48. Lagrange's first memoir (Turin Memoirs, 1766-1769) refers to Euler's

three memoirs, but the author mentions that it was composed in 1767 with-

+ --out the knowledge of Euler's third memoir. The coordinates ultimately

made use of are v u, v u (say r, s) and \p, the same as in Euler's third

memoir, and the results consequently present themselves in the like form.

    49. If the attractive force of one of the centres is taken equal to zero,

then the position of such centre is arbitrary, and it may be assumed that the

centre lies on the curve, which is in this case an ellipse (conic section) ; the
expression of the time presents itself as a function of the focal radius vectors
and the chord of the arc described; which, as remarked, ante, No. 20, leads to
Lambert's theorem for elliptic motion.

   50. The case presents itself of an ellipse or hyperbola described under the

--vE==-^action of the two forces, viz. the equation

and Liouv. t. ix. p. 113, 1844, that the result is a mere corollary of a general

theorem, which is in. effect as follows, viz. if a particle under the separate

actions of the forces P, F, . . . starting in each case from the same point in

the same direction but with the initial velocities v, v', &c. respectively,

describe the same curve, then such curve will also be described under the

conjoint action of all the forces, provided the body start from the same point

which the problem can be solved. Writing U, V, u, v in the place of Lagrange's

Lagrange in effect reproduces his solution for the above-mentioned law of

U=force (say  aB

              -^ + 2yu, Y=--i + 2yv)*. There are even in the third edition

a few trifling errors of work to be corrected. The remarks above referred to,

as made by Lagrange in his first memoir, are also reproduced (see anU,

Nos. 49 and 50).

pFonctions EUiptiques," t. i. (1825), uses                             2  and     2  in  the  place of  Euler's

                                                                               q                                 p,  q  ;

the forces are assumed to vary as (dist.) -2, and in consequence of the change

Euler's cubic radicals are replaced by quartic radicals involving only even

ppowers of and q respectively ; that is, the radicals are in a form adapted for

the transformation to elliptic integrals ; in certain cases, however, it becomes

necessary to attribute to Legendre's variables p and q imaginary values.

The various cases of the motion are elaborately discussed by means of the

elliptic integrals ; in particular Legendre notices certain cases in which the

Euler's variables.

motion is oscillatory, and which, as he remarks, seem to furnish the first
instance of the description by a free particle of only a finite portion of the
curve which is analytically the orbit of the particle ; there is, however, nothing
surprising in this kind of motion, although its existence might easily not have
been anticipated.

   56. § 26 of Jacobi's memoir " Theoria Novi Multiplicatoris &c." (1845) is
entitled " Motus puncti versus duo centra secundum legem Neutonianum
attracti." The equations for the motion in space are by a general theorem

given in the memoir " De Motu puncti singidaris " (1842), reduced to the case

of motion in a plane : viz. if x, y are the coordinates, the centre point of the
axis being the origin, and y being at right angles to the axis, and if the distance

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        72

--of the centres is 2a ; then the only difference is that to the expression for

--there is added a term , which arises from the rotation about the axis. Two

integrals are obtained, one the integral of Vis Viva, and the other of them an

integral similar to one of those of Euler's or Lagrange's. And then x', y'

being the differential coefficients of x, y with regard to the time, the remain-

--ing equation may be taken to be y'dx x'dy--0, where x', y' are to be

expressed as functions of x, y by means of the two given integrals. This

being so, the principle of the Ultimate Multiplier * furnishes a multiplier of

this differential equation, and the integral is found to' be

                           --y'dx x'dy

          £xy (x't-y^ + ^-af+y^x'y' = >

the quantity under the integral sign being a complete differential. To verify

a, posteriori that this is so, Jacobi introduces the auxiliary quantities X', X"

+ +y --defined as the roots of the equation X2 X(x2 2 2)-- 2?/2 =0, which in

fact, if as before u, v are the distances from the centres, leads to

u+v=2»Ja2 -- X', u-- i/=2Va2 - \",

u--so that X', \" are functions of u+v,  v respectively; and the formulae,

as ultimately expressed in terms of X', X", are substantially of the same form
with those of Euler and Lagrange.

   57. The investigations contained in Liouville's three memoirs " Sur quel-

ques cas particuliers &c." (1846), find their chief application in the problem
of two centres, and by leading in the most direct and natural manner to the
general law of force for which the integration is possible, they not only give
some important extension of the problem, but they in fact exhibit the pro-
blem itself and the preceding solutions of it in their true light. But as they
do not relate to this problem exclusively, it will be convenient to consider
them separately under the head Miscellaneous Problems.

   58. In Serret's ' These sur le Mouvement &c.' (1848), the problem is very
elegantly worked out according to the principles of Liouville's memoirs as
follows : viz. assuming that the expression of the distance between two con-
secutive positions of the body is

+ +«V
X(mdfi2  ndv2)                           X"dy2
                                                            ,

where m, n are functions of /z, v respectively, and if the forces can be repre-
sented by means of a force-function U, then the motion can be determined,

                               X

where the functional symbols <j>, <P, &c. denote any arbitrary functions what-

ever.

    59. It is then assumed that //, v are the parameters of the confocal ellipses

and hyperbolas situate in the moveable plane through the axis, viz. that wo

have

                          a* y2

                          ¥V.2 i=l|

(the  origin  is  midway  between  the   two     centres,                       26  being  their  distance

|yu, \v are in fact equal to the sum and difference u+v, u--v of the two

centres respectively) ; and that the position of the moveable plane is deter-

mined by means of y, the inclination to a fixed plane through the axis, or

say, as before, its azimuth. In fact, with these values of the coordinates, tho

expression of ds2 is

                  rv* * '{fS--b^b*-- 2                                          vr

which is of the required form. And moreover if the forces to the two centres

vary as (dist.)- 2, and there is besides a force to the middle point varying a3
the distance, then

                      V=JL-+jL+K(,c + S-b%

--whence (observing that X=/i2        2  XU  is  of  the                        required  form.  The equa-

                                   r)

Utions obtained by substituting for          the above value give the ordinary

solution of the problem.

60. Liouville's note to the last-mentioned memoir (1848) contains the

demonstration of a theorem obtained by a different process in his second

memoir, but which is in the present note, starting from Serret's formulae,

demonstrated by the more simple method of the first memoir, viz., it is

shown that the motion can be obtained if the two centres, instead of

being fixed, revolve about the point midway between them in a circle in such

manner that the diameter through the two centres always passes through the

projection of the body on the plane of the circle. It will be observed that

the circular motion of the two centres is neither a uniform nor a given

motion, but that they are, as it were, carried along with the moving body.
   61. In Desboves's memoir " Sur le Mouvement d'un point materiel &c."

(1848), the author developes the solution of the foregoing problem of moving

centres, chiefly by the aid of the method employed in Liouville's second

memoir. And he shows also that the methods of Euler and Lagrange for

the case of two fixed centres apply with modification to the more complicated

problem of the moving centres.
    62. The problem of two centres is considered in Bertrand's " Memoire

6ur les equations differentielles &c." (1852), by means of Jacobi's form of the

the addition of a force OC-- (ante, No. 56).

    63. Cayley's " Note on Lagrange's Solution &c." (1857) is merely a repro-

duction of the investigation in the ' Mecanique Analytique ;' the object was
partly to correct some slight errors of work, and partly to show what were
the combinations of the differential equations, which give at once the integrals

of the problem.

   64. In § II. of Bertrand's " Memoire sur quelques unes des formes &c."
(1857), the following question is considered, viz., assuming that the dynamical

equations

the distance from any fixed point (or rather the sum of any number of such

functions), it is shown that the only case in which the differential equations

for the motion of a point attracted to a fixed centre of forces have an inte-

gral of the form in question is the above-mentioned one of two centres, each

attracting according to the inverse square of the distance, and a third centre

midway between them, attracting as the distance.

   65. The problem is obviously the same as that of a heavy particle on the

surface of a sphere.

   I have not ascertained whether the problem was considered by Euler.
Lagrange refers to a solution by Clairaut, Mem. de l'Acad. 1735.

   The question was considered by Lagrange, Mec. Anal. 1st edit. p. 283.
The angles which determine the position are i// the inclination of the string

to the horizon, <f> the inclination of the vertical plane through the string to a

fixed vertical plane, or say the azimuth. And then forming the equations of

motion, two integrals are at once obtained ; these are the integrals of Vis

Viva, and an integral of areas. And these give equations of the form

<?r=funct. (\P) dxp, cty=funet. (\l)d\j, ; so that t, <p are each of them given by a
quadrature in terms of \p, which is the point to which the solution is carried.

It is noticed that ^ may have a constant value, which is the case of the

conical pendulum.

   66. In the second edition, t. xi. p. 197 (1815), the solution is reproduced;
only, what is obviously more convenient, the angles are taken to be

                               \p, the inclination to the vertical,
                               <p, the azimuth.

It is remarked that ^ will always lie between a greatest value a and a least

value                and  the integrals  are  transformed                                       by  introducing          therein  instead  of
                ft,

i/> the angle a, which is such that

                               = +cos \L cos a, sin2 a cos ft cos2 <r,
202 report--1862.

by which substitution they assume a more elegant form, involving only the

radical

                     V 1+Jc'- (cos ft-- cos a) cos 2a,

--where Jc is a constant depending on cos a, cos ft ; and the integration is effected

approximately in the case where cos/3 cos a is small.
   M. Bravais has noticed, however, that by reason of some errors in the

working out, Lagrange has arrived at an incorrect value for the angle <i>,
which is the apsidal angle, or difference of the azimuths for the inclinations

a  and            :  see the 3rd edition (1855), Note VII., where M. Bravais resumes the
              ft

+calculation, and he arrives at the value <l>=^(l §a/3), a and ft being small.

    Lagrange considers also the case where the motion takes place in a resist-
ing medium, the resistance varying as velocity squared.

   A67. similar solution to Lagrange's, not carried quite so far, is given in

Poisson's ' Mecanique,' t. i. pp. 385 et seq. (2nd ed. 1833).

  A short paper by Puiseux, " Note sur le Mouvement d'un point materiel

>sur une sphere " (1842), shows merely that the angle <J> is ^.

    68. The idterior development of the solution consists in the effectuation of
the integrations by the elliptic and Jacobian functions. It is proper to re-
mark that the dynamical problem the solution whereof by such functions
was first fairly worked out, is the more difficult one of the rotation of a
solid body, as solved by Jacobi (1839), in completion of Rueb's solution (1834),
2>ost, Nos. 186 and 197.

   69. In relation to the present problem we have Gudermann's memoir " De

pendulis sphajricis &c." (1849), who, however, does not arrive at the actual
expressions of the coordinates in terms of the time ; and the perusal of the
memoir is rendered difficult by the author's peculiar notations for the elliptic

functions*.

    70. It would appear that a solution involving the Jacobian functions was
obtained by Durege, in a memoir completed in 1849, but which is still un-

published ; see § XX. of his ' Theorie der elliptischen Functionen' (1861),

where the memoir is in part reproduced. It is referred to by Bichclot in
the Note presently mentioned.

   We71. have next Tissot's ' These de Mecanique,' 1852, where the ex-

pressions for the variables in terms of the time are completely obtained by
means of the Jacobian functions H, G, and which appears to be the earliest
published one containing a complete solution and discussion of the problem.

    72. Richelot, in the Note " Bemerkungen zur Theorie des Raumpendels "

(1853), gives also, but without demonstration, the final expressions for the
coordinates in terms of the time.

   Donkin's memoir " On a Class of Differential Equations &c." (1855) con-

tains (No. 59) an application to the case of the spherical pendulum.
    73. The first part of the memoir by Dumas, " Leber die Bewegung des

Baumpendels," &c. (1855), comprises a very elegant solution of the problem of
the spherical pendulum based upon Jacobi's theorem of the Principal Func-
tion (1837), and which is completely developed by the elliptic and Jacobian
functions. The latter part of the memoir relates to the effect of the rotation

of the Earth ; and we thus arrive at the next division of the general subject.

   * The mere use of sn., en., da. as an abbreviation of the somewhat cumbrous sinam.,

74. Laplace (Me'c. Celeste, Book X. c. 5) investigates the equations for the

motion of a terrestrial body, taking account of the rotation of the Earth (and

also of the resistance of the air), and he applies them to the determination

of the deviations of falling bodies, &c. He does not, however, apply them to

the case of the pendulum.

  We75. have also the memoir of Gauss, " Fundamental-gleichungen, tfcc."

have not had the opportunity of consulting this memoir.

is the actual force of gravity as affected by the resolved part of the centrifugal

force ; ft is the latitude. There are some niceties of definition which are

carefully given by Poisson, but which need not be noticed here.

77. Poisson applies his formulas incidentally to the motion of a pendulum,

which he considers as vibrating in a plane ; and after showing that the time
of oscillation is not sensibly affected, he remarks that upon calculating the

force perpendicular to the plane of oscillation, arising from the rotation of the

Earth, it is found to be too small sensibly to displace the plane of oscillation

--or to have any appreciable influence on the motion a conclusion which, as is

well known, is erroneous. He considers also the motion of falling bodies, but

the memoir relates principally to the theory of projectiles.

   78. That the motion of the spherical pendulum is sensibly affected by the
rotation of the Earth is the well-known discovery of Foucault ; it appears by
his paper, " Demonstration Physique &c," Comptes Rendus, t. xxxii. 1851,
that he was led to it by considering the case of a pendulum oscillating at the

pole ; the plane of oscillation, if actually fixed in space, will by the rotation

of the Earth appear to rotate with the same velocity in the contrary direction ·

and he remarks that although the case of a different latitude is more compli-
cated, yet the result of an apparent rotation of the plane of oscillation, dimi-

nishing to zero at the equator, may be obtained either from analytical or from
mechanical and geometrical considerations. Some other Notes by Eoucault

on the subject are given, ' Comptes Rendus,' t. xxxv. (1853).

   79. An analytical demonstration of the theorem was given by Binet

'Comptes Rendus,' t. xxxii. (1851), and by Baehr (1853). Various short
papers on the subject will be found in the ' Philosophical Magazine,' and

elsewhere.

   80. In regard to the above-mentioned problem of falling bodies, we have a
Noto by W. S., Camb. and Dub. M. Journ. t. iii. (1848), containing some errors
204 report--1862.

which are rectified in a subsequent paper, " Remarks on the Deviation of

Palling Bodies," &c. t. iv. (1849), by Dr. Hart and Professor W. Thomson.

    81. The theory of relative motion is considered in a very general manner
in M. Quet's memoir, " Des Mouvements relatifs en general &c." (1853). Sup-

which belongs to a set of fixed axes of £, >/, £.

   82. The equations for the motion of a free particle are of course «=X,

v=Y, w=Z. In the case where the moveable axes are fixed on the Earth,

and moveable with it (the diurnal motion being alone attended to), these lead

to equations for the motion of a particle in reference to the Earth, similar to
those obtained by Gauss and Poisson. The formulae are applied to the case
of the spherical pendulum, which is developed with some care ; and Foucault's
theorem of the rotation of the plane of oscillation very readily presents itself.

The general formulae are applied to the relative motion of a solid body, and
in particular to the question of the gyroscope ; the memoir contains other in-

teresting results.

   83. The principal memoirs on the motion of the spherical pendulum, as
affected by the rotation of the Earth, are those of Hansen, " Theorie der Pen-

delbewegung &c." (1853), which contains an elaborate investigation of all the
physical circumstances (resistance of the air, torsion of the string, &c.) which can
affect the actual morion, and the before-mentioned memoir by Dumas, " Ueber
der Bewegung des Eamnpendels &c." (1855). The investigation is conducted

by means of the variation of the constants ; the integrals for the undisturbed
problem were, as already noticed, obtained by means of Jacobi's Principal

Function, that is, in a form which leads at once to the expressions for the

variation of the constants ; and the investigation appears to be carried out

in a most elaborate and complete manner.
    84. In concluding this part of the subject I refer to Mr. "Worms's work,

'The Botation of the Earth' (1862), where the last-mentioned questions
ON THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF DYNAMICS.                    205

(falling bodies, the pendulum, and the gyroscope) are, in reference to the
proofs they afford of the rotation of the Earth, considered as well in an experi-
mental as in a mathematical point of view. The second part of the volume
contains the theory (after Laplace and Gauss) of falling bodies, that of the
pendulum (after Hansen), and that of the gyroscope (after Yvon Villarceau) ;
and the whole appears to be a complete and satisfactory resume of the experi-
mental and mathematical theories to which it relates.

  We85. have also Cohen " On the Differential Coefficients and Determinants

of Lines &c." (1S62), where the equations for relative motion are obtained in

a very elegant manner. The fundamental notion of the memoir may be con-

sidered to be the dealing directly with lines, velocities, &c, which are variable
in direction as well as in magnitude, instead of referring them, as in the ordi-
nary analytical method, to axes fixed in space. The memoir is a highly in-
teresting and valuable one, and the results are brought out with great facility
but I cannot but think that the great care required to apply the method cor-

rectly is an objection to it, if used otherwise than by way of interpretation of

previously obtained results, and that the ordinary method is preferable.

   I may remark that the theory of relative motion connects itself with the

lunar and planetary theories as regards the reference of the plane of the orbit
to the variable ecliptic, and as regards the variations of the position of the
orbit; but this is a subject which I have abstained from entering upon.

solution is obtained for an interesting particular case. Let A, B, C be the

   89. The bodies are considered as restricted to move in a given line ; but it

is clear that if the bodies, considered as free points in space, are initially in a
line, and the initial velocities are also in this line, then the bodies will always

continue in this lino, which will be a fixed line in space. But if the distances
and velocities are as above, except only that the velocities, instead of being
along the line, are parallel to each other in any direction whatever, then the
bodies will always continue in a line, which is in this case a moveable line

in space (see post, No. 93).

(§28, entitled "De Problemate trium corporum in eadem recta motorum. Sub-

and elegant investigation of the same problem. The centre of gravity being

remarks, the transformation employed in his memoir " Sur 1' elimination des

   92. The concluding part of the section relates to the very general problem
of a system of n particles acted on by any forces homogeneous functions of

the coordinates (this includes the case of n particles mutually attracting each
other according to a power of the distance), and this more general investiga-
tion illustrates the method employed in regard to the three bodies in a line.

It may be remarked that in the general theorem for the n particles " sint

vires &c.," the constant of Vis Viva is supposed to vanish.

                            Particular cases of the motion of three bodies.

   93. In the case of three bodies attracting each other according to the in-

verse square of the distance, the bodies may move in such manner as to be

constantly in a line (a moveable line in space) ; this appears by the memoir
Euler, " Considerations generales, &c." (1764), in which memoir, however
(which it will be observed precedes the memoir " De Motu rectilineo &c "
(1765), referred to No. 88), Euler assumes that the mass of one of the bodies
is so small as not to affect the relative motion of the other two. Calling
the bodies the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and taking the masses to be 1, m, 0,

then a result obtained is, that in order that the Moon may bo perpetually

in conjunction, its distance must be to that of the Sun as a : 1, where

-- + a=m(l-- a)2 =3a3 3a4 a% or                 3 /I^ nearly. It appears, however {antt,

No. 88), that the foregoing restriction as to the masses is unnecessary, and, as
will be mentioned, the jjroblem has since been treated without such restriction.

Euler investigates the motion in the case where the initial circumstances are

nearly but not exactly as originally supposed ; this assumes, however, that

the motion is stable i. e. that the bodies will continue to move nearly, but
not exactly as originally supposed, which is at variance with the conclusions

of Liouville's memoir, post, No. 95. I have not examined the cause of this

discrepancy.

   94. In the 'Mecanique Celeste' (1799), Book x. c. 6, Laplace considers
two cases where the motion can be exactly determined.

   1°. Force varies as any function of the distance. It is shown that the

motion may be such that the bodies form always an equilateral triangle of

--variable magnitude the motion of each body about the centre of gravity

being the same as if that point were a centre of force attracting the body

according to a similar law.

2°.  Force                        n  The motion may be such that the three bodies are

              oc(dist.) .

always in a right line (moveable in space), the relative distances being in

fixed ratios to each other.          In particular, if           force       OC                                 2  then

                                                                                              (dist.)~ ,

m, m! , m" being the masses, the quantity z which determines the ratio of the

distances m"m' , trim is given by

     0=m:2    [(l+r)  3              -l]-Ht'(l  +      2  (l-~3  )-m"[(l  +               r,  -^]=0,

                                                   ~)                        r)

which is, in fact, the formula in Euler's memoir " De Motu rectilineo &c."

95. Liouville's memoir " Sur un cas particulier &c." (1842) has for its

object to show that if the initial circumstances are not precisely as supposed

in the second of the two cases considered by Laplace, or, what is the same

thing, in Euler's memoir " Considerations gencrales &c," then the motion is

unstable ; the instability manifests itself in the usual manner, viz. the expres-

sions for the deviations from the normal positions are found to contain real

exponentials which increase indefinitely with the time.

9G. It may be proper to refer here to Jacobi's theorem, ' Comptes Rendus,'

myt. iii. p. 61 (1836), quoted in the foot-note p. 15 of                         Report of 1857,

which relates to the motion of a point without mass revolving round the Sun,

and disturbed by a planet moving in a circular orbit, and properly belongs (as

I have there remarked) to the problem of two centres, one of them moveable

and the other revolving round it in a circle with uniform velocity. The

theorem (given without demonstration by Jacobi) is proved by Lioiiville in

his last-mentioned memoir, and he remarks that the theorem follows very

simply as a corollary of the theorem by Coriolis, " On the Principle of Vis Viva

in Relative Motions," Journ. de l'Ecole Polyt. t. xiii. p. 268 (1832). There

is, however, no difficulty in proving the theorem ; another proof is given,

Cayley, " Note on a Theorem of Jacobi's &c." (1862).

    97. I do not consider the various integrable cases of the motion of a par-
ticle in a resisting medium, the resistance varying with the velocity according
to some assumed law, the particle being either not acted on by any force, or

acted upon by gravity only. Some interesting cases are considered in Jacobi's

memoir "DeMotu puncti singularis" (1842), §§ 6 and 7 (see post, No. 108).

     98. In the case of a central force varying as (disk) -2, the effect of a resist-

ing medium (E QC v2 ) is considered in reference to the lunar theory, in the
' Mecanique Celeste,' Book VII. c. 6. Formula? for the variations of the

elliptic elements are given in the ' Mecanique Analytique,' t. ii. (2nd edition).

Biit the variations of the elliptic elements are fully worked out by means of
elliptic and Jacobian functions in Sohncke's valuable memoir " Motus Corporum
&c." (1833).

   99. The effect of the resistance of the air on a pendulum has been elaborately
considered by Poisson, Bessel, Stokes, and others ; as the dimensions of the

ball are attended to, the problem is in fact a hydrodynamical one.
   The effect on the spherical pendulum is considered in Hansen's memoir

" Theorie der Pendelbewegung &c." (1853).
   The effect on the motion of a projectile is considered in Poisson's memoirs

" Sur le Mouvement des Projectiles &c." (1838).

    100. In the first memoir (§ 1) the author considers a point moving in a

plane or on a given surface, where the principle of Vis Viva holds good (or say
where there is a force-function U). The coordinates of the point, and the

function U, may be expressed in terms of two variables a, /3, and it is assumed

that these are such that

                                ds*=\(da2 +dl32),

where X is a function of a and /3.    That   is, we have           T=|X(a'  2  +/3'  2      and the

One integral of these is

The geometrical signification of the equation ds2 =k(da2 +dfi2), or of the last-

mentioned equivalent form, is that the curves

              \=a or  const.,          =/3 or fx const.,

intersect at right angles.

   The foregoing differential equation of the path, writing //i, Fv in the place

of fa, F/3 respectively, may be expressed in the form

                 + =cos2 i

where i, 90°-- i are the inclinations of the path at the point (A, p) to the two

orthotomic curves through this point.

101. The before-mentioned equation

              (2U + C)\=/a-F/3

may be satisfied independently of C, or else only for a particular value of C.
In the former case the law of force is much more restricted, but on the other

hand there is no restriction as regards the initial circumstances of the motion;

it is the more important one, and is alone attended to in the sequel of the

memoir. In the case in question (changing the functional symbols) we must

have

              \=(j>cc--B7/3, \U=/a-- F/3;

It is noticed also that taking B, e to denote two new arbitrary constants,

and writing

              9 =pa V 2fa + Cfa- A+jd/3 V A-2F/3 + Cw/3,

the equation of the trajectory and the expression for the time assume the

   If the forces vanish, the path is a geodesic line ; and denoting by a the ratio

of the constants A, C, we have

coordinates of a point in piano, then writing instead of them x, y, we have

+ds2 =dar dy2, which is of the required form ; but the result obtained is the

self-evident one, that the equations may be integrated by quadratures when

Uwhich is of the proper form, and the corresponding expression of is

so that the force -function having this value (//u, Fv being arbitrary functions
of n and v respectively), the equations of motion may be integrated by qua-

dratures.

and the case is that of forces to the foci varying inversely as the squares of

the distances, and a force to the centre varying directly as the distance--

the case considered by Lagrange in the problem of two centres. But this is

merely one particular case of those given by the general formula.

centre) lead to some interesting results ; it is noticed also that the expression

that it may be thereby ascertained (without transforming to elliptic coordi-

nates) whether a given value of the force-function is of the form considered

in the theory.

   In § 3 the author considers the expression dx*-\- dy2 =\(da2 +dj32 ), \ being

in the first instance any function whatever of a and /3 ; and he shows that the
expressions of x, y are given by the equation

4* being any real function. If, however, it is besides assumed that X is of

--the required form=/a F/3, then he shows that the system of elliptic coordi-

nates is the only one for which the conditions are satisfied. §§ 4, 5, 6, and 7

relate to the motion of a point on a sphere, an ellipsoid, a surface of revolu-

tion, and the skew helicoid respectively ; and the concluding § 8 contains only

a brief reference to the author's second memoir.

Formulae are exhibited under a purely analytical point of view ; so much so,

that the coordinates of the points (3 for each point) are considered as forming

a  single   system  of  variables  x,         x       .  .  .  x.       The partial differential equation is

it appears to be a very valuable one) than to dynamics.

what are the special problems incidentally considered in the under-mentioned

memoirs which are referred to in several places in the present Report.

 --107. Jacobi, " De Motu puncti singularis " (1842). I call to mind that

the memoir chiefly depends on the theorem of the Ultimate Multiplier (the

theory in its generality being developed in the later memoir " Theoria Novi
Multiplicatoris &c," 1844-45). § 4 is entitled " The motion of a point on the

surface of revolution," which, the principle of the conservation of areas holding

good, is reduced to the problem of the motion on the meridian curve, and thus

depends upon quadratures only. § 5 is entitled " On the motion of a point

about a fixed centre attracted according to a certain law more general than the

Newtonian one" (ante, No. 85). § 6. " On the motion of a point on a given curve

and  in  a  resisting  medium"     =a+be(resistance                     e"2                            or=a+6i/2 );  and§  7.   "On

   108. In Jacobi's memoir " Theoria Novi Multiplicatoris &c." (1845), § 25
is entitled " On the motion of a point attracted towards a fixed centre " (see

ante, No. 87) ; § 26. " On the motion of a point attracted towards two fixed
centres according to the Newtonian law " (ante, No. 56) ; § 27. " On the rota-
tion of a solid body about a fixed point" (post, No. 193); § 28. " On the problem

of three bodies moving in a right line ; the Eulerian substitution ; theorems
on homogeneous forces" (ante, No. 91)]; and§ 29, "The principle of the ultimate
multiplier applied to a free system of material points moving in a resisting

medium ; on the motion of a comet in a resisting medium about the sun."
   109. And in Jacobi's memoir " Nova Methodus &c." (1862), besides § 64

and § 65, which are applications of the method to general dynamical theorems,

we have § 66, containing a simultaneous solution of the problem of the motion

of a point attracted to a fixed centre and of that of the rotation of a solid body

(post, No. 206), and § 67, relating to the motion of a point attracted to a fixed

centre according to the Newtonian law.

will presently appear. It will be seen that whereas the problem as it stood

before Jacobi depends on a system of seven equations, it has been shown by

him that there may be separated off from this a system of six equations.

problem of the motion of three mutually attracting bodies is in the first

instance reduced to that of the motion of two fictitious bodies (which may be

considered as mutually attracting bodies, attracted by a fixed centre of force)*.

In fact, in the original problem the centre of gravity of the three bodies moves

uniformly in a right line, and it may without any real loss of generality be

taken to be at rest ; that is, if the ^-coordinates of the three bodies are £lS

mination of the time would then depend on a quadrature only. But for the

system of eleven equations we have four integrals, viz., the integral of Vis Viva

and the three integrals of areas, and the system is thus reducible to one of

--(11 4=) seven equations. This preliminary transformation in Jacobi's

memoir explains the remark that the problem, as it stood before him, depended

on a system of seven equations.

      115. Jacobi remarks that in the transformed problem the three integrals

of areas show (1) that the intersection of the planes of the orbits of the two

bodies lie in a fixed plane, the invariable plane of the system                                                                                                                                                                                       (2)  that the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

inclinations of the planes of the two orbits to this fixed plane, and the para-

meters of the two orbits considered as variable ellipses, are four elements any

two of which rigorously determine the two others.

   And then choosing for variables the inclinations of the two orbits to the

invariable plane, the two radius vectors, the angles which they form with the

intersection of the planes of the two orbits, and lastly the angle between this

intersection (being as already mentioned a hne in the invariable plane) with
a fixed hne in the invariable plane, he finds that the last-mentioned angle

entirely disappears from the system of differential equations, and is determined
after their integration by a quadrature. In this new form of the differential

equations there is no trace of the nodes. The differential equations which

determine the relative motion of the three bodies are reduced to five equations

of the first order and one of the second order. The equations in question are

the equations I. to VI. given at the end of the memoir. It is to be remarked

that the differential dt is not eliminated from these equations ; the last of

and actual replacement of the problem of the three bodies by that of the two bodies

attracted to a fixed centre, is due to Bertrand {post, No. 117).

referred to as disappearing from the system of equations I. to VI.

   116. But when Jacobi says, " Par suite on a fait cinq integrations. Les

integrates connues n'etant qu'au nombre de quatre, on pourra done dire que

Ton a fait une integration de plus dans le systeme du monde. Je dis dans

le systeme du monde puisque la meme methode s'applique a, un nombre

quelconque de corps," the language used is not, I think, quite accurate. It,

in fact, appears from the memoir that it is only on the assumption of the

integration of the system of six equations that, besides the integral of Vis Viva

and the integrals of areas, the remaining two integrals are known ; in fact,

after, but not before the system of the order six has been integrated, the time t
and the angle CI are each of them given by a quadrature. ·

 --117. Bertrand's " Memoire sur l'integration des equations differentielles de

la Mecanique " (1852). I have spoken of this memoir in No. 56 of my former

Keport. The course of investigation is the inquiry as to the integrals, which,

combined according to Poisson's theorem with the integral of Vis Viva or any

other given integral, give rise to an illusory result. But as regards the appli-
cation made to the problem of three bodies, it will be more convenient to state

from a different point of view the conclusions arrived at : and I may mention
that when the author says " Je parviens . . a reduire la question a l'integration

de six equations tout du premier ordre, e'est-a-dire que j'effectue une integra-

tion de plus que ne l'avait fait Jacobi," he seems to have overlooked that

Jacobi's system of five equations of the first order and one of the second order

really is, as above noticed, a system of the six equations with another equation

which then gives the time by a quadrature, and that, at least as appears to

me, he has not advanced the solution beyond the point to which it had been

carried by Jacobi*.

fact the equation V. of the system in Jacobi's form, so that it is really a

system of six equations (antt, No. 115).

      2°. The system secondly discussed is Bertrand's system of nine equations

the last of them being referred to as a result announced by M. Bertrand in

his course. But it is shown by M. Bour in the memoir next referred to (post,

No. 122), that the multiplier for the system in question can be obtained in a

very much more simple manner, almost without calculation.

   120. In connexion with Jacobi's theory of the elimination of the Nodes, I

may refer to the investigations " Application to the Problem of three Bodies "

Nos. 84 to 96 of Donkin's memoir " On a Class of Differential Equations &c."

Part II. The author remarks that his differential equations No. 93 an°ord an

example of the so-called elimination of the Nodes, quite different however (in

that they are merely transformations of the original differential equations of

the problem without any integrations) from that effected by Jacobi.

   121. It may be right to refer again in this place to the concluding part of

§ 28 of Jacobi's memoir " Nova Theoria Multiplicatoris " (ante, No. 92), as

bearing on the problem of three bodies.

 --122. Bour's " Memoire sur le Probleme des Trois Corps " (1856). The

author remarks that Bertrand's system of equations have lost the remarkable

form and the properties which characterize the ordinary equations for the

solution of a dynamical problem. But by selecting eight new variables

functions of Bertrand's variables, the system may be brought back to the

standard Hamiltonian form

                                           dq _dR              dPi _         dR

and guiding himself by a theorem in relation to canonical integrals obtained

in his memoir of 1855 (see No. 66 of my former Report), he finds by a

somewhat intricate analysis the expressions of the eight new variables

Pd Z>2> J?a> Pi> 1\> Iv ?3' If ^-^e results ultimately obtained are of a very

premarkable and interesting form, viz. H=funct. {pv ,p p q q q ?2 3 , 4 , x , 2 , 3 , 4 ) is

equal to the value it would have for motion in a plane, plus a term admitting

of a simple geometrical interpretation, and he thus arrives at the following

theorem as a resume of the whole memoir, viz.,
   " In order to integrate in the general case the problem of three bodies, it

is sufficient to solve the case of motion iu a plane, and tben to take account of

a disturbing function equal to the product of a constant depending on the

areas by the sum of the moments of inertia of the bodies round a certain axis,

divided by the square of the triangle formed by the three bodies."

123. It may be remarked that the only given integral of the system of

H =eight equations is the integral of Vis Viva,  const., and that using this

equation to eliminate one of the variables, and omitting the equation (=dt),

we have, as in the solutions of Jacobi and Bertrand, a system of six equations

between seven variables. As the equations are in the standard dynamical

form, no investigation is needed of the multiplier M, which is given by

Jacobi's general theory, and consequently when any five integrals of the six

equations are given, the remaining integral can be obtained by a quadrature.

In the case of three bodies moving in a plane, the solution takes a very

simple form, which is given in the concluding paragraph of the memoir.

               Transformation of Coordinates, Articles Nos. 124 to 141.

   124. It may be convenient to remark at once that two sets of rectangular
coordinates maybe related to each other properly or improperly, viz., the axes

to which they belong (considered as drawn from the origin in the positive

directions) may be either capable or else incapable of being brought into
coincidence. The latter relation, although of equal generality with the former
one, may for the most part be disregarded ; for by merely reversing the direc-

tions of the one set of axes, the improper is converted into the proper relation.

   125. In the memoir " Problema Algebraicum <fec." (1770) Euler proposes to
himself the question " Invenire novem numeros ita in quadratum disponendos

And he remarks that this is in fact the problem of the transformation of coor-
dinates, viz., if we have

                           X=ax +ftij + yz,
                            ++Y=a!x ft'y y'z,
                            Z=x"x+ft"y + y"z,

then the first equations are such as to give identically

                              X2 + Y2 +Z2 =.v2 +f + z\

    126. Assuming the first six equations, he shows by a direct analytical

a=process that a2 =(ft'y"--ft"y') 2, or               ±(fi'y"~/3"y') 5 or taking the positive

sign (for, as the numbers may be taken as well positively as negatively, there

is  nothing  lost  by  doing  so)                  "          which    gives  the  system

                                                            y

and from these he deduces the second system of six equations.                       The inverse

system of equations

                          X +ax -\-a'y oc"z,

                             + +Y=ftx ft'y ft"z,
                             Z =yx + y'y + y"z

is not explicitly referred to.

    127. He then satisfies the equations by means of trigonometrical substitu-
+ =tions,
    viz.,    assuming  a=cos£,     then                    2  a" 2     sin2 £, which is satisfied by

                                                      a'

a'=sin£ cosr;, a"=sin£ sin/j, &c, and he thus obtains for the coefficients a

set of values involving the angles £, rj, 6, which are the same as those men-

tioned post, No. 130. And he shows how these formulae maybe obtained geo-

metrically by three successive transformations of two coordinates only. The

remainder of the memoir relates to the analogous problem of the transforma-

tion of four or more coordinates.

   128. I have analysed so much of Euler's memoir in order to show that it

contains nearly the whole of the ordinary theory of the transformation of

coordinates ; the only addition required is the equation

                                   a            ft ,  y        = ±1,
                                             ,  ft',
                                                ft",  7
                                   «',
                                   a",                y"

+ --where the sign
                       "--gives a=ft' y yft" ', &c. (ut supra), but the sign               would
=give a -(ft'y"-ft"y'), &c.

    129. The distinction of the ambiguous sign is in fact the above-mentioned

one of the proper and improper transformations

                                                 +;
--sets of axes can, for the sign                                       viz., for the sign  the two

                                                they cannot, be brought into coincidence

this very important remark was, I believe, first made by Jacobi in one of his

early memoirs in Crelle's Journal, but I have lost the reference. As already

mentioned, it is allowable to attend only to the proper transformation, and
= +to consider the value of the determinant as being
                                                                              1 ; and this is in fact

almost always done.

narily made use of in the problem of rotation and the problems of physical

astronomy generally.

published in the years 1843 and 1844 : the fundamental idea consists in the

so that representing the right-hand side by

                           W+iX+jY + kZ,

we have identically

                W-+X +Y +Z +x ++y +z + x +y'=(iv2 2 2

   It is hardly necessary to remark that Sir W. E. Hamilton in his various

publications on the subject, and in the ' Lectures on Quaternions,' Dublin,
1853, has developed the theory in detail, and has made the most interesting
applications of it to geometrical and dynamical questions ; and although the

first explicit application of it to the present question may have been made in

my own paper next referred to, it seems clear that the whole theory was in

its original conception intimately connected with the notion of rotation.

 --141. Cayley, " On certain Eesults relating to Quaternions" (1845). It is

shown that Eodrigues' transformation formula may be expressed in a very
simple manner by means of quaternions ; viz., we have

      ix+jy+kz=(l+i\+jv + kv)-i(iX+jY+kZ)(l+i\+jfx + kv),

where developing the function on the right-hand side, and equating the coeffi-

Acients of i, j, k, we obtain the formulas in question.                                                                                         subsequent paper,

         Principal Axes, ami Moments of Inertia. Article Nos. 142-163.
   142. The theorem of principal axes consists herein, that at any point of a
solid body there exists a system of axes Ox, Oy, Oz, such that

                       fyzdm=0, Jzxdm=0, jxydm=0.
--224 report 1862.

But this, the original form of the theorem, is a mere deduction from a general

theory of the representation of the integrals

             fx2dm, fy2dm, fz\lm, fyzdm, fzxdm, fxydm

for any axes through the given origin hy means of an ellipsoid depending on

the values of these integrals corresponding to a given set of rectangular axes
through the same origin.

   143. If, for convenience, we write as follows, ~K=fdm the mass of the

body, and

A.'=fx*dm, B'=/fdm, C'=fz2dm, F=fyzdm, G' =fzxdm, W=fxydm,

and moreover

          A= +z*)dm, B=f(z2 +x2)d?n, C=f(x2 +y2)dm,
                         J-(y*
             F=--fyzdm, Q=--fzxdm, B.=--fxydm*,

so that

     A=B' + C, = +B C' A', C=A' + B', F=-F, G=-G, H=-H',

then the ellipsoid which in the first instance presents itself for this purpose,
and which Prof. Price has termed the Ellipsoid of Principal Axes, but which
I would rather term the " Comomental Ellipsoid," is the ellipsoid

                     (A, B', C, F, G', H'X*, y, z)2 =Wc\

where k is arbitrary, so that the absolute magnitude is not determined. But
it is more usual, and in some respects better to consider in place thereof the
" Momental Ellipsoid" (Cauchy, " Sur les Moments d'Inertie," Exercices de
Mathematique, t. ii. pp. 93-103, 1827),

                       (A, B, C, F, G, Kjx, y, zf=Wc\

or as it may also be written,

(A + B' + C')(^ + 2/2 + Z2)-(A', B', C, F, G, Wjx, y, z)2 =Wc\

which shows that the two ellipsoids have their axes, and also their circular

sections coincident in direction.

   144. And there is besides this a third ellipsoid, the " Ellipsoid of Gyra-

tion," which is the reciprocal of the momental ellipsoid in regard to the con-

centric sphere, radius h. The last-mentioned ellipsoid is given in magnitude,

The axes of any one of the foregoing ellipsoids coincide in direction with the
principal axes of the body, and the magnitudes of the axes lead very simply

to the values of the principal moments A, B, C.
   145. The origin has so far been left arbitrary : in the dynamical applica-

tions, this origin is in the case of a solid body rotating about a fixed point,
the fixed point ; and in the case of a free body, the centre of gravity. But

the values of the coefficients (A, B, C, F, G, H), or (A, B', C, F, G, H'),

mcorresponding to any given origin whatever, are very easily expressed

* I have ventured to make this change instead of writing as usual ~$=fyzdM, &c. ; as in

F=G=H=0,most cases                            the formulae affected by the alteration are not numerous.

terms of the coordinates of this origin, and the values of the corresponding
coefficients for the centre of gravity as origin ; or, what is the same thing,

any one of the ellipsoids for the given origin may be geometrically constructed
 by means of the ellipsoid for the centre of gravity. The geometrical theory,

as regards the magnitudes of the axes, does not appear to have been any-
where explicitly enunciated ; as regards their direction, it is comprised in the
theorem that the directions at any point are the three rectangular directions

at that point in regard to the ellipsoid of gyration for fhe centre of gravity*,

post, No. 159. The notion of the ellipsoids, and of the relation between the
ellipsoids at a given point and those at the centre of gravity, once established,
the theory of principal axes and moments of inertia becomes a purely geo-

metrical one.

    146. The existence of principal axes was first established by Segner in the
work 'Specimen Theorise Turbinum,' Halle (1755), where, however, it is
remarked that Euler had said something on the subject in the [Berlin] Me-
moirs for 1749 and 1750 {post, No. 167), and had constructed a new mecha-
nical principle, but without pursuing the question. Segner's course of inves-
tigation is in principle the same as that now made use of, viz. a principal axis
is defined to be an axis, such that when a body revolves round it the forces
arising from the rotation have no tendency to alter the position of the axes.

It is first shown that there are systems of axes at, y, z such that fyzdm=0,

and then, in reference to such a set of axes, the position of a principal axis,

say the axis of X, is determined by the conditions fXYd?n=0, fXZdm=0
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    )

being the inclinations of the principal axis to those of x, y, z), and then

A=fxputting  2dm, &c. (F=0 by hypothesis), Segner's equations for the de-

termination of t, t are

             (C'-B')r-G'fr-+H'*=0,

the second of which gives

                           T ~B'-C' + G't'

and by means of it the first gives

   + =G' 2 i3 -G'(A'-B')<2 {(B'-C')(C'-A')-G' 2 -H'2 }<+G'(B'-C') 0,

which being a cubic equation shows that there are three principal axes ; and
it is afterwards proved that these are at right angles to each other.

   147. To show the equivalence of Segner's solution to the modern one, I

remark that if u=f~Ssdm, we have

             (A.'--tt)*+ H' r+G' =0,

              B' « + (B'-- u)r+F =0,

whence

* The rectangular directions at a point in regard to an ellipsoid are the directions of

the axe3 of the circumscribed cone, or, what is the same thing, they are the directions of

the normals to the three quadric surfaces confocal with the given ellipsoid, which pass

through the given point. The theory of confocal surfaces appears to have been first given

by Chasles, Note XXXI. of the ' Apercu Historique ' (1837).

by means of which Segner's equations may he verified. I have given this

analysis, as the first solution of such a problem is a matter of interest.
    148. There is little if anything added to Segner's results by the memoir,

Euler, "Becherches sur la Connaissance Hecanique des Corps" (1758), which
is introductory to the immediately following one on Rotation.

   149. Relating to the theory of principal axes we have Binet's "Memoire
sur les Axes Conjugues," &c. (1813). The author proposes to make known
the new systems of axes which he calls conjugate axes, which, when they are

at right angles to each other, coincide with the principal axes ; viz. consider-

ing the sum of the molecules each into its distance from a plane, such distance

being measured in the direction of a line, then (the direction of the line being
given) of all the planes which pass through a given point, there is one for

which the sum in question is a minimum, and this plane is said to be con-
jugate to the given line, and from the notion of a line and conjugate plane
he passes to that of a system of conjugate axes. The investigation (which

is throughout an elegant one) is conducted analytically; the coordinates
made use of are oblique ones, and the formulae are thus rendered more com-
plicated than they would otherwise have been ; in referring to them it will
be convenient to make the axes rectangular.

    150. One of the results is the well-known equation

(A'-e)(B'-e)(C'-e)-F2(A, -e)-G2(B'-e)-H'2(c'-e)4-2FG'H'=o ;

which, if  xv yv  z     are  the  principal  axes, has for its  roots  fxfdm, J'y^dm,
                     x

fzfclm.

   And the equations (1), p. 49, taking therein the original axes as rect-

angular, are

this is a symmetrical system of equations for finding cos a : cos (5 : cos y,
less simple however than the modern form (post, No. 154), the identity of

which with Binet's may be shown without difficulty.

    151. Another result (p. 57) is ttat if the original axes are principal axes,
and if Ox, Oy, Oz are the principal axes through a point the coordinates

whereof are/, g, h, and if 9/= (say) fx^clm, then we have

and he remarks that his conjugate axes are in fact conjugate axes in respect

to this ellipsoid, and consequently that the principal axes are in direction the

principal axes of this ellipsoid : it is noticeable that the ellipsoid thus inci-

dentally considered is not the comomental ellipsoid itself, but, as just re-

marked, its reciprocal in regard to a concentric sphere.

   152. Poisson, 'Mecanique' (1st ed. 1811, and indeed 2nd ed. 1833), gives
the theory of principal axes in a less complete form than in Binet's memoir

for the directions of the principal axes are obtained in anything but an

elegant form.

in the place of principal axis, which is employed to designate a principal

axis through the centre of gravity. The memoir- contains a variety of very

interesting geometrical theorems, which however, as no ellipsoid is made use of,

can hardly be considered as exhibited in their proper connexion. The author

arrives incidentally at certain conies, which are in fact the focal conies of

the momental ellipsoid (A, B, C, F, G, HJ#, y, z)2 =l, and employs it as

well to prove the existence of the principal axes as to determine their di-

rection, and also the magnitudes of the principal moments; the results are

obtained in the simplest and best forms ; viz. the direction cosines are given

any diameter of the ellipsoid is inversely proportional to the square of this dia-

meter. It is to be noticed that Poinsot speaks only of the ellipsoid having

its centre at the centre of gravity, but that such ellipsoid may be constructed

about any point whatever as centre, so generalized, it is in fact the mo-

156. Pine, " On the Principal Axes, &c." (1837), obtained analytically in

a very elegant manner equations for determining the positions of the prin-

viz. these are similar to those of Cauchy, only they belong to the comomental

instead of the momental ellipsoid.

157. Maccullagh, in his Lectures of 1844 (see Haughton), considers the

momental ellipsoid

body with respect to any axis passing through the origin is proportional to

the square of the radius vector of the ellipsoid ; and from the geometrical

theorem of the ellipsoid having principal axes he obtained the mechanical

theorem of the existence of principal axes of the body ; at least I infer that

he did so, although the conclusion is not explicitly stated in Haughton's

account ; but in all this he had been anticipated by Cauchy. And after-

contemporaneous, or nearly so, with Thomson's, and several of the conclusions

are common to the two. From the character of the paper, I find it difficult

to give an account of it ; and I remark that, the theory of principal axes

once brought into connexion with that of confocal surfaces, all ulterior deve-

lopments belong more properly to the latter theory.

   162. Haton de la Goupilliere's two memoirs, " Sur la Theorie Nouvelle de

results appear to be given with much care and completeness, but I have not

examined them in detail. The author refers to the researches of Thomson

and Townsend.

   163. I had intended to show (but the paper has not been completed for

publication) how the momental ellipsoid for any point of the body may be

obtained from that for the centre of gravity by a construction depending on
the " square potency " of a point in regard to the last-mentioned ellipsoid.

    164. It will be recollected that the problem is the same for a body rotating
about a fixed point, and for the rotation of a free body about the centre of
gravity; the case considered is that of a body not acted on by any forces.
According to the ordinary analytical mode of treatment, the problem depends
upon Euler's equations

axes ; considering jp, q, r as known, we obtain by merely geometrical consi-

derations a system of three differential equations of the first order for the
 determination of the position in space of the principal axes.

    165. The solution of these, which constitutes the chief difficulty of the
problem, is usually effected by referring tbe body to a set of axes fixed in
space, the position whereof is not arbitrary, but depends on the initial circum-
stances of the motion ; viz. the axis of z is taken to be perpendicular to the
so-called invariable plane. The solution is obtained ivithout this assumption
both by Euler and Lagrange, although, as remarked by them, the formulas
are greatly simplified by making it ; it is, on the other hand, made in the

solution (which may be considered as the received one) by Poisson ; and the

results depending on it are the starting-point of the ulterior analytical deve-

lopments of Rueb and Jacobi ; the method of Poinsot is also based upon the

consideration of the invariable plane.

    166. D'Alembert's principle, which affords a direct and general method
for obtaining the equations of motion in any dynamical problem whatever,
was given in bis " Traite de Dynamique " (1743) ; and in his memoir of 1749
he applied it to the physical problem of the Precession of the Equinoxes, which
is a special case of the problem of Rotation, the motion of rotation about the
centre of gravity being in fact similar to that about a fixed point. But, as
might be expected in the first attempt at the analytical treatment of so
difficult a problem, the equations of motion are obtained in a cumbrous and
unmanageable form.

    167. They are obtained by Euler in the memoir " Decouverte d'un Nou-
veau Principe de Mecanique," Berlin Memoirs for 1750 (1752) (written

before the establishment of the theory of principal axes), in a perfectly
elegant form, including the ordinary one already mentioned, and, in fact,

Hreducible to it by merely putting the quantities F, G-, (which denote the

integrals fyzdm, &c.) equal to zero. But Euler does not in this memoir

enter into the question of the integration of the equations.

    168. The notion of principal axes having been suggested by Euler, and

their existence demonstrated by Segner, we come to Euler's investigations
contained in the memoirs " Du Mouvement de Potation &c," Berlin Me-

moirs for 1758 (printed 1765) and for 1760 (printed 1767), and the " Theoria
Motus Corporum Solidorum &c." (1765). In the memoir of 1760, and in
the "Theoria Motus," Euler employs b, the angular velocity round the in-

=stantaneous axis, but not the resolved velocities 8 cos a, 8 cos /3, 8 cos y

( _P> 2» r) '· these quantities (there called x, y, z) are however employed in
the memoir, Berlin Memoirs (1758), which must, I apprehend, have been
written after the other, and in which at any rate the solution is developed

with much greater completeness. It is in fact carried further than the

ordinary solutions, and after the angular velocities p, q, r have been found,
the remaining investigation for the position in space of the principal axes,
conducted, as above remarked, without the aid of the invariable plane, is one

of great elegance.

   169. In the last-mentioned memoir Euler starts from the equations given
by d'Alembert's principle ; viz. the impressed forces being put equal to zero,

these are

or, what is the same thing, using a, v, iv to denote the velocities of an element

in the directions of the axes fixed in space, these are

                                          2dm(x^-yf) = 0.

It is assumed that at any moment the body revolves round an instantaneous

axis, inclinations a, (3, y, with an angular velocity 8 ; this gives

                    u= = --8 (z cos /3 y cos y) qz ry,
                     =v=v (x cos y z cos a) rx --pz,

                         w=v(y cos a x cos/3) =px--qy,

if 8 cos a, e cos /3, 8 cos y are denoted by p, q, r. The values of du, dv,
dw are obtained by diiferentiating these formulas, treating p, q, r, x, y, z as
variable, and replacing dx, dy, dz by udt, vdt, wdt respectively; ya. the
resulting formulae for ydw--zdv, &c, x, y, z are considered as denoting the
coordinates of the element in regard to axes fixed in the body and moveable

with it, but which at the moment under consideration coincide in position

with the axes fixed in space. The expressions for 2 {ydw--zdv) dm involve

the integrals A=~f(y2 +z2 )dm, &c, where the coordinates refer to axes fixed

in the body ; and if these are taken to be principal axes, the expression for

+2 (ydw--zdv) dm is =Adp (C-- B)qrdt, which gives the three equations

                                          Adp+ (C-- B) qrdt=0,

                                          Bdq + (A--C)rpdt=0,
                                          Cdr + (B--A)pqdt=0,

already referred to as Euler's equations.

170. Next, as regards the determination of the position in space of the

principal axes : if about the fixed point we describe a sphere meeting the

principal axes     in x           yv zx,  and if                                           P be an         arbitrary point on the sphere          and

PQ an arbitrary direction through P, the quantities used to determine the

=Ppositions of                                                                                                               1, m, n) and the incli-

               x,        x                                                                              x              2

(it is to be observed that the sines and cosines of the differences of X, p., v are

given functions of the sines and cosines of I, m, n, and, moreover, that

m +cos2Z-t-cos2    cos2n=l, so that the number of independent parameters is

three). The above is Euler's definition ; but if we consider a set of axes fixed

Xin space meeting the sphere in the points X, Y, Z, then if the point be

XTtaken for P, and the arc                  for PQ, it is at once seen that the angles used

for determining the relative positions of the two sets of axes are the same as

in Euler's memoir "Eormulae Generales, &c," 1775 (ante, No. 132), where

the formulae for this transformation of coordinates are considered apart from

the dynamical theory.

Euler expresses the quantities p, q, r in terms of an auxiliary variable u,

which  is  such    that du=pqrdt                                                           p,  q,  r are   at      once      obtained  in  terms  of  w,
                                                                                        ;

and then t is given in terms of u by a quadrature. Euler employs also an

auxiliary angle TJ, given in terms of u by a quadrature. And he obtains

Ufinite algebraical expressions in u, cos U, sin for the cosines or sines of

l,m,n; s (the angular distance IP, if I denote the point in which the instan-

-- --taneous axis meets the sphere), <p (the angle IPQ,) and A <p, fi v<j>, <p.
--232 report 1862.

The formula}, although complicated, are extremely elegant, and they appear

to have been altogether overlooked by subsequent writers.
    171. Euler remarks, however, that the complexity of his solution is owing

to the circumstance that the fixed point P is left arbitrary, and that they

G-- W=0may be simplified by taking this point so as that a certain relation

may be satisfied between the constants of the solution ; and he gives the far

more simple formula? corresponding to this assumption. This amounts to

taking the point P in the normal of the invariable plane, and the resulting

formulae are in fact identical with the ordinary formulas for the solution of
the problem. The expression invariable plane is not used by Euler, and
seems to have been first employed in Lagrange's memoir " Essai sur le Pro-

blems de Trois Corps," Prix de l'Acad. de Berlin, t. ix. (1772) : the theory
in reference to the solar system has been studied by Laplace, Poinsot, and

others.

   172. Lagrange's solution in the memoir of 1773 is substantially the same
with that in the ' Mecanique Analytique.' Only he starts from the integral
equations of areas and of Vis Viva, but in the last-mentioned work from the
equations of motion as expressed in the Lagrangian form by means of the

Vis Viva function T (=^(x' 2 +y' 2 +z' 2 )clm). The distinctive feature is that

he does not refer the body to the principal axes but to any rectangular

axes whatever fixed in the body: the expression for T consequently is

T=! (A, B, C, F, G, HY», q, rf, instead of the more simple form

                              T=i(Ap2 + Bq2 + Cr2),

which it assumes when the body is referred to its principal axes. And

Lagrange effects the integration as well with this more general form of T, as
without the simplification afforded by the invariable plane ; the employment,

however, of the more general form of T seems an unnecessary complication

of the problem, and the formulae are not worked out nearly so completely as

in Euler's memoir. It may be observed that p, q, r are expressed as functions

+Vp +2of the instantaneous velocity w(= 2 2 r2 ), and thence t obtained by a

--quadrature as a function of w.
   173. Poisson's Memoir of 1809. The problem is only treated incidentally

for the sake of obtaining the expressions for the variations of the arbitrary
constants ; the results (depending, as already remarked, on the consideration
of the invariable plane) are obtained and exhibited in a very compact form,

and they have served as a basis for further developments ; it will be proper
to refer to them somewhat particularly. The Eulerian equations give, in the

first place, the integrals

                               Ap2 +Bq2 + 2 =h,

                               Ay+BY+CV=P;

and then by means of these, p, q being expressed in terms of r, we have t in

terms of r by a quadrature.

174. The position in space of the principal axes is determined by referring

them, by means of the angles 0, 0, c, to axes Ox, Oy, Oz fixed in space ; if, to

fix the ideas, we call the plane of xy the ecliptic (Ox being the origin of

longitudes),  and  the  plane  of  the  two  principal  axes  x           y1  the  equator,  then we
                                                                   x

equivalent to two independent equations, the values of \, fi, v being such that

+ =cos2A+cos2/i cos2 j' l ; but the position of the axis of z may be chosen so

that the values on the right-hand sides become 0, 0, Tc ; the axis of z is then

perpendicular to the invariable plane, the condition in qiiestion serving as a

definition. And the three equations then give

where the values of a", fi", y" in fact are

to the value of dd, or is determined as a function of r by a quadrature.
    176. The constants of integration are h, Tc, I (the constant attached to i),

g (the constant attached to 0) ; and two constants, say a the longitude of
the node, and y the inclination of the invariable plane in reference to an
arbitrary plane of xy and origin x of longitudes therein. I remark in passing

that Poisson obtains an elegant set of formulae for the variations of the

constants h, Tc, g, I, a, y, not actually in the canonical form, but which may

by a slight change be reduced to it.

    177. Legendre considers the problem of Eotation in the 'Exerciees de
Calcul Integral,' t. ii. (1817), and the " Theorie des Fonctions Elliptiques,"

t. i. pp. 366-410 (1826). He does not employ the quantities p, q, r, but

obtains de novo a set of differential equations of the second order involving

the angles which determine the position of the principal axes with regard to

the axes fixed in space : these angles are in fact (calling the plane of the

fixed axes x, y the ecliptic) the longitude and latitude of one of the principal
axes, and the azimuth from the meridian through such principal axis of an

arbitrary axis fixed in the body and moveable with it. The solution is
developed by means of the elliptic integrals. Erom the peculiar choice of
variables there would, it would seem, be considerable labour in comparing the
results with those of other writers, and there would be but little use in

doing so.

 --178. Poinsot's "The'orieNouvelle de la Eotation des Corps." The 'Extrait

of the memoir was published in 1834, but the memoir itself was not published
in extenso until the year 1851 . The ' Extrait ' contains, however, not only the
fundamental theorem of the representation of the motion of a body about a
fixed point by means of the momental ellipsoid rolling on a fixed tangent
plane, but also the geometrical and mechanical reasonings by which this
theorem is demonstrated ; it establishes also the notions of the Poloid and
Serpoloid curves ; and it contains incidentally, and without any developments,
a very important remark as to the representation of the motion by means of
the rolling and sliding motion of an elliptic cone. The whole theory (includ-
ing that of the last-mentioned representation of the motion) is in the memoir
234 report--1862.

itself also analytically developed, but without the introduction of the elliptic

and Jacobian functions : to form a complete theory, it would be necessary to

incorporate the memoir with that of Jacobi.

179. The following is an outline of the ' Extrait ' :

The instantaneous motion of a body about a fixed point is a motion of

rotation about an axis (the instantaneous axis) ; and hence the finite motion
is as if there were a cone fixed in the body which rolls (without sliding) upon

another cone fixed in space.

The instantaneous motion of a body in space is a motion of rotation about

an axis combined with a translation in the direction of this axis : this remark

is hardly required for Poinsot's purpose, and he does not further develope the

theory of the motion of a body in space. The effect of a couple in a plane

perpendicular to a principal axis is to turn the body about this axis with an

angvdar velocity proportional to the moment of the couple divided by the

moment of inertia about the axis.

And hence by resolving any couple into couples perpendicular to the prin-

cipal axes, the effect of such couple may be calculated ; but more simply by

+ + =kmeans of the central ellipsoid (momental ellipsoid a2x2
                                                                            b  2a   c2z2   i

                                                                                y           , if

                   ,

plane of the ellipsoid, the instantaneous axis passes through the point of con-

tact ; and reciprocally given the instantaneous axis, the couple must act in the

tangent plane.

180. Considering now a body rotating about a fixed point, and taking as

the plane of the couple of impulsion a tangent plane of the ellipsoid, the

instantaneous axis is initially the diameter through the point of contact ; the

centrifugal forces arising from the rotation produce however an accelerating

couple, the effect whereof is continually to impress on the body a rotation

which is compounded with that about the instantaneous axis, and thus to

cause a variation in the position of this axis and in the angular velocity round

it. The axis of the accelerating couple is always situate in the plane of the

couple of impulsion.

181. Hence also

1°. Throughout the motion the angular velocity is proportional to the length

of the instantaneous axis considered as a radius vector of the ellipsoid.

2°. The distance of the tangent plane from the centre is constant ; that is,

the tangent plane to the ellipsoid at the extremity of the instantaneous axis

is a fixed plane in space.

Or, what is the same thing, the motion is such that the ellipsoid remains

always in contact with a fixed plane, viz., the body revolves round the radius

vector through the point of contact, the angular velocity being always pro-

portional to the length of this radius vector.

It is right to remark that in Poinsot's theory the distance of this plane

from the centre depends on the arbitrarily assumed magnitude of the central

ellipsoid ; the parallel plane through the centre is the invariable plane of the

motion.

182. The motion is best understood by the consideration that it is implied

in the theorem that the pole of the instantaneous axis describes on the ellip-
soid a certain curve, " the Poloid," which is the locus of all the points for

which the perpendicular on the tangent plane has a given constant value (the

curve in question is easily seen to be the intersection of the ellipsoid by a

concentric cone of the second order) ; and that the instantaneous axis describes

on the fixed tangent plane a curve called the Serpoloid, which is the locus of

the points with which the several points of the poloid come successively in con-

sumes continually the same series of values. This is in fact evident from the

mode of generation ; and it is moreover.clear that the serpoloid is an algebraical

or else a transcendental curve according as II is or is not commensurable with jf,
   [Treating the poloid and serpoloid as cones instead of curves, the motion

of the body is the rolling motion of the former upon the latter cone, which

agrees with a previous remark.]

There is a very interesting special case where the perpendicular distance

from the tangent plane is equal to the mean axis of the ellipse.

183. Poinsot remarks that the motion is such that [considering the plane

of the couple of impulsion as drawn through the centre of the ellipsoid] the

section of the ellipsoid is an ellipse variable in form but of constant magni-

tude, and that this leads to a new representation of the motion, viz., that it

may be regarded as the motion of an elliptic cone which rolls on the plane of
the couple [the invariable plane] with a variable velocity, and which slides on

this plane ivith a uniform velocity.

184. The theory of the last-mentioned cone, say the " rolling and sliding

cone," is developed in the memoir, Liouville, t. xvi. p. 303, in the chapter

entitled " Nbuvelle Image de la Rotation des Corps." If a, b, c signify as

C=H«before (viz., A, B,     H62  2    He2 ),         and if h                             be  the  distance  of  the  centre

from Poinsot's fixed tangent plane (7t<«>c), then the invariable axis

describes in the body a cone the equation whereof is

is the " rolling and sliding cone." The generating line OT of this cone is

perpendicular to the plane of the instantaneous axis 01, and of the invariable

OGaxis  ; and the analytical expressions for the rolling and sliding velocities

follow from the geometrical consideration that the motion at any instant is a

rotation round the instantaneous axis 01 : that for the sliding velocity is the

instantaneous angular velocity into the cosine of the angle IOG, which is in

fact constant ; that for the rolling velocity is given, but a further explanation

of the geometrical signification is perhaps desirable.

185. I may in this place again refer to Cohen's memoir " On the Differential

Coefficients and Determinants of Lines &c." (1862), the latter part of which

contains an application of the method to finding Eider's equations for the

motion of a rotating body.

186. Rueb in his memoir (1834) first applied the elliptic and Jacobian func-

tions to the present problem. Starting from the equations

   189. The advance made was enormous ; the result is that we have in terms

of the time sin c sin f, cos c sin <p, cos <p (the cosine inclinations of the inva-

riable axis to the principal axes), and also d, the longitude of the node. The
cosine inclinations of the axes of as and y to the principal axes could of course
be obtained from these, but they would be of a very complicated and un-

manageable form ; the reason of this is the presence in the expression for 6 of

--the non-periodic term n'u. It will presently be seen bow tbis difficulty was

got over by Jacobi.

190. Briot's paper of 1842 contains an analytical demonstration of some

of the theorems given in the 'Extrait' of Poinsot's memoir of 1834.

191. In Maccullagh's Lectures of 1844 (see Haughton, 1849 ; Maccullagh,

1847) the problem of the rotation of a solid body is treated in a mode some-

what similar to that  of Poinsot's;                                                         l x2 v2  z2

                 ,             ,

reciprocal to the poloid curye on the momental ellipsoid we have on the

ellipsoid of gyration a curve all the points whereof are equidistant from the

centre ; such curve is of course the intersection of the ellipsoid by a concen-

tric sphere, that is, it is a spherical conic ; and the points of this spherical

conic come successively to coincide with a fixed point on the invariable axis.

This is a theorem stated in Art. YI. of Haughton's memoir : it may be added

that the several tangent planes of the ellipsoid of gyration at the points of the

spherical conic as they come to coincide with the fixed point, form a cone

reciprocal to Poinsot's serpoloid cone. It is clear that every theorem in the

one theory has its reciprocal in the other theory ; I have not particularly

examined as to how far the reciprocal theorems have been stated in the two

theories.

192. Cayley, " On the Motion of Rotation of a Solid Body " (1843).--The

object was to apply to the solution of the problem Rodrigues' formulae for the

resultant rotation ; viz., if the principal axes, considered as originally coin-

ciding with the axes of x, y, z, can be brought into their actual position at the

=end of the time t by a rotation 6 round an axis, inclined at angles /, g, h to

the axes of x, y, z, and if \ tan ±d cos/, yu=tan \Q cos g, »>=tan *0 cos h,
then the principal axes are referred to the axes fixed in space by means of

the quantities X, jj, v. And these are to be obtained from the equations

                                  = +icpdt 2( dk vdjj. --jidv),
                                  -- + +k qdt=2( vd\ d/j, \dy),

of t, or of other the variable selected as the independent one. But for effecting

the integration it was found necessary to take the axes of z as the invariable

axes.

193. The solution by Jacobi, § 27 of the memoir " Theoria Novi Multi-

plicatoris" (1845), is given as an application of the general theory, the author

remarking that, as well in this question as in the problem of the two fixed

centres, he purposely employed a somewhat inartificial analysis, in order to

show that the principle (of the Ultimate Multiplier) would lead to the result

without any special artifices. The principal axes are referred to the axes
fixed in space by the ordinary three angles (here called qv q2, q3), and the
solution is carried so far as to give the integral equations, without any reduc-

tion of the integrals contained in them to elliptic integrals. The solution is,

howeve*, in so far remarkable that the integrations are effected without the

aid of the invariable plane.

 --194. Cayley, " On the Rotation of a Solid Body &c." (184G). It appeared

desirable to obtain the solution by means of the quantities X, p, v, without the
assistance of the invariable plane, and Jacobi's discovery of the theorem of the
--238 report 1862.

Ultimate Multiplier induced me to resume the problem, and at least attempt

to bring it so far as to obtain a differential equation of the first order between
two variables only, the multiplier of which could be obtained theoretically

by Jacobi's discovery. The choice of two new variables to which the equa-
tions of the problem led me, enabled me to effect this in a simple manner

and the differential equation which I finally obtained turned out to be inte-
grable per se, so that the laborious process of finding the multiplier became

unnecessary.

   195. The new variables £2, v have the following geometrical significations

+£2=Ztan|0 cosT, where I is the principal moment (A2p2 B2^2 -l-CV=Z2 ) J

  (as before) the angle of resultant rotation, and I is the inclination of the

resultant axis to the invariable axis ; and v=l~ cos2 |J, where if we imagine

a line AQ, having the same position relatively to the axes fixed in space that

the invariable axis has to the principal axes of the body, then J is the incli-

nation of this line to the invariable axis. It is found that p, q, r are func-

tions of v only, whereas X, p, v contain besides the variable £2. In obtaining

=«/--these relations, there                                   2
              occurs  a  singular    relation       2           ,  which  may  also

                                               £2

+be written 1 tan2 10 cos2 I=sec2 id cos2 |J, where the geometrical significa-

tions of the quantities I, J have just been explained. The final results are

--that the time t, and the arc tan-  are each of them expressible as the

integrals of certain algebraical functions of v. There might be some interest

in comparing the results with those of Euler's memoir of 175S, where the

principal axes are also referred to an arbitrary system of axes fixed in space

but I was not then acquainted with Euler's memoir.

The concluding part of the paper relates to the determination of the varia-

tions of the constants in the disturbed problem.
   196. Cayley, " Note on the Rotation of a Solid of Revolution " (1849), shows

the simplification produced in the formulae of the last- mentioned memoir in

the case where two of the moments of inertia are equal, say A=B.

197. Jacobi's final solution of the problem of Rotation was given without

demonstration in the letter to the Academy of Sciences at Paris ; the demon-

stration is added in the memoir, Crelle, t. xxxix. (1849). The fundamental

idea consists in taking in the invariable plane, instead of the fixed axes xy, a

set of axes xy revolving with uniform velocity, such that the angular distance
= --of the axis of as from its initial position is precisely
                                                              n'u ; and consequently

if 6' be the longitude of the node of the equator on the invariable plane, mea-
sured from the moveable axis of x as the origin of longitude, we have

                                                                                                                  i

and in consequence of this form of the expression for d' (=«-. into a loga-

rithmic function) in passing to the trigonometrical functions sin 6', cos 0' the

logarithm disappears altogether ; and we have in a simple form the expres-

sions for the actual functions sin &, cos 6', through which 6' enters into the
formulae, and thus, Jacobi remarks, the barrier is cleared which stands in

the way when the expression of an angle is reduced to an elliptic integral

of the third class.

    198. For the better expression of the results, Jacobi joins to the functions

=0^H, e, considered in the " Fundamenta Nova," the functions 6 (K-- u),

H («)=H(K-«); so that

 u

of formulae given in the " Fundamenta Nova" in reference to elliptic integrals

of the third class.

   199. It is worth noticing how the residts connect themselves with Poinsot's

theorem of the rolling and sliding cone, the velocity of the rolling motion
depends only upon the position, on the cone, of the line of contact, so that
the same series of velocities recur after any number of complete revolutions
of the cone ; that is, the total angle desci'ibed by the line of contact in conse-
quence of the rolling motion, consists of a part varying directly with the
time (or say varying as u) and a periodic part ; the former part combines
with the similar term arising from the sliding motion, and the two together
give Jacobi's term n'u.

    200. Somoff's memoir (1851), written after Jacobi's Note in the * Comptes
Rendus,' but before the appearance of the memoir in Crelle, gives the de-

monstration of the greater part of Jacobi's residts.
    201. Booth's " Theory of Elliptic Integrals &c." (1851) (contemporaneous

with the publication of Poinsot's memoir of 1834) contains various interest-
ing analytical developments, and, as an interpretation of them, the author
obtains (p. 93) the theorem of the rolling and sliding cone. The investiga-

tions involve the elliptic integrals, but not the elliptic or Jacobian functions.

   &202. Bichelot's two Notes (Crelle, tt. xlii. xliv.) relate to the solution

of the problem of rotation given in his memoir " Eine neue Losung &c."

   204. I have quoted the foregoing results from the Note (Crelle, t. xlii.),
having seen, but without having studied, the Memoir itself : the results appear
very interesting and valuable ones ; but they seem to require a more com-
plete geometrical development than they have received in the Memoir ; and I

am not able to bring them into connexion with the other researches on

the subject.

   205. The solution, § 3 of Donkin's memoir " On a Class of Differential

Equations &c." (part i. 1854), is given as an illustration of the general
theory to which the memoir relates ; it contains, however, some interesting

geometrical developments in regard to the case (A=B) of two equal moments
of inertia. I have not compared the results with those in my Note of 1849.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        i

in the two problems coidd be investigated by a common analysis, remarks,
" Sed ipsa problemata duo imperturbata hie primum, quantum credo, amplexus

Problem of Rotation, embracing and incorporating all tbat has been done on

the subject, is greatly needed.

Kinematics of a solid body. Article Nos. 208 to 215.

208. The general theorem in regard to the infinitesimal motions (rotations

and translations) of a solid body is that these are compounded and resolved in

the same way as if they were single forces and couples respectively. Thus

any infinitesimal rotations and translations are resolvible into a rotation and

a translation ; the rotation is given as to its magnitude and as to the direction

of its axis, but not as to the position of the axis (which may be any line in

the given direction) : the magnitude and direction of the translation depend

on the assumed position of the axis of rotation ; in particular this may be

taken so that the translation shall be in the direction of the axis of rotation ;

and the magnitude of the rotation is then a minimum. I remark that the

theorem as above stated presupposes the establishment of the theory of couples

(of forces) which was first accomplished by Poinsot in his 'Siemens de

Statique,' 1st edit. 1804 ; it must have been, the whole or nearly the whole of

it, familiar to Chasles at the date of his paper of 1830 next referred to (see

XXXIValso Note  of the Apertju Historique, 1837) ; and it is nearly the whole

of it stated in the ' Extrait ' of Poinsot's memoir on Rotation, 1834.

 --209. Chasles' paper in the ' Bulletin Univ. des Sciences ' for 1830. The

corresponding theorem is here given for the finite motions (rotations and

translations) of a solid body as follows, viz. if any finite displacement be given

to a free solid body in space, there exists always in the body a certain inde-

finite hue which after the displacement remains in its original situation. The

theorem is deduced from a more general one relating to two similar bodies. It

may be otherwise stated thus : viz., any motions may be represented by a

translation and a rotation (the order of the two being indifferent) ; the rotation

is given as regards its magnitude and the direction of its axis, but not as to

the position of the axis (which may be any line in the given direction) ; the

magnitude and direction of the translation depend on the assumed position of

the axis of rotation ; in particular this may be taken so that the translation

shall be in the direction of the axis of rotation ; the magnitude of the trans-

lation is then a minimum.

It may be noticed that a translation may be represented as a couple of

rotations ; that is, two equal and opposite rotations about parallel axes.

210. It is part of the general theorem that any number of rotations about

axes passing through one and the same point may be compounded into a

single rotation about an axis through that point ; this is, in fact, the theory

of the " Resultant Axis " developed in Euler's and Lexell's memoirs of 1775.

211. The following properties are also given, viz., considering two similar

solid bodies (or in particular any two positions of a solid body) and joining

the corresponding points, the lines which pass through one and the same

point form a cone of the second order ; and the points of either body form

on this cone a curve of the third order (skew cubic). And, reciprocally, the

lines, intersections of corresponding planes, which lie in one and the same

plane envelope a conic, and such planes of either body envelope a developable

surface, which is such that any one of these planes meets it in a conic [or,

what is the same thing, the planes envelope a developable surface of the fourth

order].

   And also, given in space two equal bodies situate in any manner in respect

to each other, then joining the points of the first body to the homologous

points of the second body, the middle points of these lines form a body capable
ON THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF DYNAMICS.  243

of an infinitesimal motion, each point of it along the line on which the same

is situate.

   212. The entire theory, as well of the infinitesimal as of the finite motions
of a solid body, is carefully and successfully treated in Rodrigues' memoir
" Des lois geornetriques &c." (1840). It may be remarked that for the purpose

of compounding together any rotations and translations, each rotation may be

resolved into a rotation about a parallel axis and a couple of rotations, that
is, a translation ; the rotations are thus converted into rotations about axes
through one and the same point, and these give rise to a single resultant
rotation given as to its magnitude and the direction of the axis, but not as to

the position of the axis (which is an arbitrary line in the given direction)
the translations are then compounded together into a single translation, and

finally the position of the axis of rotation is so determined that the translation
shall be in the direction of this axis ; the entire system is thus compounded
(in accordance with Chasles' theorem) into a rotation and a translation in the
direction of the axis of the rotation. The problem of the composition depends
therefore on the composition of rotations about axes through one and the
same point ; that is, upon Euler's and Lexell's theory of the resultant axis.

But, as already noticed, the analytical theory of the resultant axis was per-
fected by Rodrigues in the present memoir (see ante, ' Transformation of Co-
ordinates,' Nos. 139-141, as to this memoir and the quaternion representation

of the formulae contained in it).

    213. It was remarked in Poinsot's memoir of 1834 that every continuous
motion of a solid body about a fixed point is the motion of a cone fixed in
the body rolling upon another cone fixed in space. The corresponding theorem
for the motion of a solid body in space is given

   Cayley, "On the Geometrical Representation &c. "(1846), viz. premising that

a skew surface is said to be " deformed " if, considering the elements between
consecutive generating lines as rigid, these elements be made in any manner

--to turn round and slide along the successive generating lines : and that two

skew surfaces can be made to roll and slide one upon the other, only if the

--one is a deformation of the other and that then the rolling and sliding
--motions are perfectly determined and that such a motion may be said to be

a " gliding " motion : the theorem is that any motion whatever of a solid body

in space may be represented as the gliding motion of one skew surface upon

another skew surface of which it is the deformation.
    214. The same paper contains the enunciation and analytical proof of the

following theorem supplementary to that of Poinsot just referred to, viz.

that when the motion of a solid body round a fixed point is represented as

the rolling motion of one cone on another, then " the angular velocity round

the line of contact (the instantaneous axis) is to the angular velocity of this

line as the difference of the curvatures of the two cones at any point in this
line is to the reciprocal of the distance of the point from the vertex."

    215. There are a great number of theorems relating to the composition of
forces and force-couples, which consequently relate also to infinitesimal rota-
tions and translations. See, for instance, Chasles, " Theoremes generaux &c."
(1847), Mobius, " Lehrbuch der Statik " (1837), Steichen's Memoirs of 1853
and 1854, &c. Arising out of some theorems of Mobius in the " Statik," we

have Sylvester's theoiy of the involution of six lines : viz. six lines (given in

position) may be such that properly selected forces along them (or if we

please, properly selected infinitesimal rotations round them) will counter-

balance each other ; or, what is the same thing, the six lines may be such

that a system of forces, although satisfying for each of the six lines the con-

                                                                           e2

dition moraent=0, will not of necessity be in equilibrium ; such six lines are
said to be in involution, and the geometrical theory is a very extensive and

interesting one.

    216. As under the foregoing head, " Rotation round a fixed point," I have
considered only the case of a body not acted upon by any forces, the case
where the body is acted upon by any forces comes under the present head.
The forces, whatever they are, may be considered as disturbing forces, and
the problem be treated by the method of the variation of the elements ; this
is at any rate a separate part of the theory of rotation round a fixed point,
and I have found it convenient to include it under the present head ; the
only case in which the forces have been treated as principal ones, seems to be
that of a heavy body (a solid of revolution) rotating about a point not its
centre of gravity. The case of a body suspended by a thread or resting on a
plane comes under the present head, as also would (in some at least of the
questions connected with it) the gyroscope. But none of these questions are
here considered in any detail.

        --Rotation round a fixed point Variation of the elements.

    217. The forces acting on the body are treated as disturbing forces.
Formulas for the variations of the elements were first obtained by Poisson
in the memoir '· Sur la Variation des Constantes Arbitraires &c." (1809). The

variations are expressed in terms of the differential coefficients of the disturb-
ing function in regard to the elements, and, as the author remarks, they are
very similar in their form to, and can be rendered identical with, those for
the variations of the elements in the theory of elliptic motion.

   218. Cayley, " On the Rotation &c." (1846).--The latter part of the paper
relates to the variations of the elements therein made use of, which are

different from the ordinary ones.
   219. Richelot, " Eine neue Ldsung &c." (1851).--The form in which the

integrals are obtained by means of a function V, satisfying a partial differen-
tial equation, leads at once to a canonical system for the variations of the
elements ; these formulas are referred to in the introduction to the memoir,
but they are not afterwards considered.

   220. Cayley, « On the Rotation of a Solid Body" (I860).--The elements are
those ordinarily made use of, with only a slight variation occasioned by the

employment of the " departure " of the node. The course of the investigation

consists in obtaining the variations in terms of the differential coefficients of
the disturbing function in regard to the coordinates (formulas which were

thought interesting for their own sake), and in deducing therefrom those in

terms of the differential coefficients in terms of the elements.

                               Other cases of the motion of a solid body.

   221. In regard to a heavy solid of revolution rotating about a fixed point

not its centre of gravity, we have
   Poisson, " Memoire sur un cas particulier &c." (1831), and the elaborate

memoir
   Lottner, "Reduction der Bewegung <fcc." (1855), where the solution is

worked out by means of the Elliptic and Jacobian functions.

To -which several others might doubtless be added ; but the problems are so
difficult, that the solutions cannot, it is probable, be obtained in any very

complete form.
    In conclusion, I can only regret that, notwithstanding the time which has

--elapsed since the present Peport was undertaken, it is still both as regards

the omission of memoirs and works which should have been noticed, and the

--merely cursory examination of some of those which are mentioned far from

being as complete as I shoidd have wished to make it. To have reproduced,
to any much greater extent than has been done, the various mathematical
investigations, would not have been proper, nor indeed practicable ; at the
same time, more especially as regards the subjects treated of in the second
part of this Report, or say the kinematics and dynamics of a solid body, sxich
a reproduction, incorporating and to some extent harmonizing the original
researches, but without ignoring the points of view and methods of investi-
gation of the several authors, would be a work which would well repay the

labour of its accomplishment.

ON DOUBLE REFRACTION.  253

 Report on Double Refraction. By Gr.G. Stokes, M.A.,D.C.L.,Sec.R.S.,

   Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in the University of Cambridge.

 I regret to say that in consequence of other occupations the materials for a
 complete report on Physical Optics, which the British Association have re-

 quested me to prepare, are not yet collected and digested. Meanwhile, instead

 of requesting longer time for preparation, I have thought it would be well to
 take up a single branch of the subject, and offer a report on that alone. I
 have accordingly taken the subject of double refraction, having mainly in
 view a consideration of the various dynamical theories which have been
 advanced to account for the phenomenon on the principle of transversal vibra-

 tions, and an indication of the experimental measurements which seem to me
 most needed to advance this branch of optical science. As the greater part

 of what has been done towards placing the theory of double refraction on a

 rigorous dynamical basis is subsequent to the date of Dr. Lloyd's admirable
 report on " Physical Optics," I have thought it best to take a review of the

 whole subject, though at the risk of repeating a little of what is already con-

 tained in that report.

    The celebrated theory of Presnel was defective in rigour in two respects,
 as Presnel himself clearly perceived. The first is that the expression for the
 force of restitution is obtained on the supposition of the absolute displacement
 of a molecule, whereas in undulations of all kinds the forces of restitution
with which we are concerned are those due to relative displacements. Presnel
endeavoured to show, by reasoning professedly only probable, that while the
 magnitude of the force of restitution is altered in passing from absolute to rela-
 tive displacements, the law of the force as to its dependence on the direction of
vibration remains the same. The other point relates to the neglect of the com-
ponent of the force in a direction perpendicular to the front of a wave. In the

state of things supposed in the calculation of the forces of restitution called

into play by absolute displacements, there is no immediate recognition of a
wave at all, and a molecule is supposed to be as free to move in one direction
as in another. But a displacement in a direction perpendicular to the front
of a wave would call into play new forces of restitution having a resultant not
in general in the direction of displacement ; so that even the component of
the force of restitution in a direction parallel to the front of a wave would
have an expression altogether different from that determined by the theory
of Fresnel. But the absolute displacements are only considered for the sake
of obtaining results to be afterwards applied to relative displacements ; and
Fresnel distinctly makes the supposition that the ether is incompressible, or
at least is sensibly so under the action of forces comparable with those with
which we are concerned in the propagation of light. This supposition re-
moves the difficulty ; and though it increases the number of hypotheses as to

the existing state of things, it cannot be objected to in point of rigour, unless
it be that a demonstration might be required that incompressibility is not in-
consistent with the assumed constitution of the ether, according to which it
is regarded as consisting of distinct material points, symmetrically arranged,
and acting on one another with forces depending, for a given pair, only on

the distance. Hence the neglect of the force perpendicular to the fronts of
the waves is not so much a new defect of rigour, as the former defect appear-
ing under a new aspect.

    I have mentioned these points because sometimes they are slurred over,
and Fresnel's theory spoken of as if it had been rigorous throughout, to the
injury of students and the retardation of the real progress of science ; and
254 HEPORT 1862.

sometimes, on the other hand, the grand advance made by Fresnel is depre-

ciated on account of his theory not being everywhere perfectly rigorous. If

we reflect on the state of the subject as Fresnel found it, and as he left it, the

wonder is, not that he failed to give a rigorous dynamical theory, but that a
single mind was capable of effecting so much.

   The first deduction of the laws of double refraction, or at least of an ap-
proximation to the true laws, from a rigorous theory is due to Cauchy*,
though Neumann t independently, and almost simultaneously, arrived at the
same results. In the theory of Cauchy and Neumann the ether is supposed
to consist of distinct particles, regarded as material points, acting on one
another by forces in the line joining them which vary as some function of
the distances, and the arrangement of these particles is supposed to be dif-
ferent in different directions. The medium is further supposed to possess
three rectangular planes of symmetry, the double refraction of crystals, so far
as has been observed, being symmetrical with respect to three such planes.
The equations of motion of the medium are deduced by a method similar to
that employed by Navier in the case of an isotropic medium. The equations
arrived at by Cauchy, the medium being referred to planes of symmetry,
contain nine arbitrary constants, three of which express the pressures in the
principal directions in the state of equilibrium. Those employed by Neumann
contain only six such constants, the medium in its natural state being sup-
posed free from pressure.

    In the theory of double refraction, whatever be the particular dynamical
 conditions assumed, everything is reduced to the determination of the velocity
 of propagation of a plane wave propagated in an)' given direction, and the
 mode of vibration of the particles in such a wave which must exist in order

 that the wave may be propagated with a unique velocity. In the theory of
 Cauchy now under consideration, the direction of vibration and the reciprocal

 of the velocity of propagation are given in direction and magnitude respec-
 tively by the principal axes of a certain ellipsoid, the equation of which con-
 tains the nine arbitrary constants, and likewise the direction-cosines of the
 wave-normal. Cauchy adduces reasons for supposing that the three constants
 G, H, I, which express the pressures in the state of equilibrium, vanish,
 which leaves only six constants. For waves perpendicular to the principal
 axes, the squared velocities of propagation and the corresponding directions
 of vibration are given by the following Table :

                                                                                         ON DOUBLE REFRACTION.                                                                                                                     255

suppose that in polarized light the vibrations are parallel, not perpendicular,

to the plane of polarization.

   Let I, m, n be the direction-cosines of the wave-normal. In the theory of
Cauchy and Neumann, the square v2 of the velocity of propagation is given
by a cubic of the form

                       v' + ay + a^ + a^O,

where a2,  a       a      are  homogeneous                                                            functions     of  the                                              1st        order           as  regards
               4,      6

L, M, N, P, Q, E, and homogeneous functions of the orders 2, 4, 6 as regards

I, m, n, involving even powers only of these quantities. For a wave perpen-

dicular to one of the principal planes, that of y z suppose, the cubic splits

into two rational factors, of which that which is of the first degree in v2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,

corresponds to vibrations perpendicular to the principal plane. This is the
same expression as results from Fresnel's theory, and accordingly the section,

by the principal plane, of one sheet of the wave-surface, which in this theory

is a surface of three sheets, is an ellipse, and the law of refraction of that ray
which is polarized perpendicularly to the principal plane agrees exactly with
that given by the theory of Fresnel.

The existence of six constants, of which only three are wanted to satisfy

the numerical values of the principal velocities of propagation in a biaxal

crystal, permits of satisfying these equations ; so that the law that the ray

polarized in the plane of incidence, when that is a principal plane, obeys the

ordinary law of refraction is not inconsistent with Cauchy's theory. This

simple law is, however, not in the slightest degree predicted by the theory,

nor even rendered probable, nor have any physical conditions been pointed

out which would lead to the relations (2) ; and, indeed, from the form of

these equations, it seems hard to conceive what physical relations they could

express. Hence an important desideratum would be left,' even if the theory

were satisfactory in all other respects.

   The equation for determining v2 virtually contains the theoretical laws of
double refraction, which are embodied in the form of the wave-surface. The

Avave-surface of Cauchy and Neumann does not agree with that of Fresnel,

except as the sections of two of its sheets by the principal planes, the third
sheet being that which relates to nearly normal vibrations. Nevertheless the
first two sheets, being forced to agree in their principal sections with Fres-
nel's surface, differ from it elsewhere extremely little. In Arragonite, for
instance, in a direction equally inclined to the principal axes, assuming Eud-
--256 report 1862.

berg's indices* for the line D, I find that the velocities of propagation of the
two polarized wares, according to the theory of Cauchy and Neumann, differ
from those resulting from the theory of Fresnel only in the tenth place of
decimals, the velocity in air being taken as unity. Such a difference as this
would of course be utterly insensible in experiment. In like manner the
directions of the planes of polarization according to the two theories, though
not rigorously, are extremely nearly the same, the plane of polarization of a
wave in which the vibrations are nearly transversal being defined as that
containing the direction of propagation and the direction of vibration, in har-

mony with the previously established definition for the case of strictly trans-

versal vibrations.

   Hence as far as regards the laws of double refraction of the two waves
which alone are supposed to relate to the visible phenomenon, and of the

accompanying polarization, this theory, by the aid of the forced relations (2),

is very successful. I am not now discussing the generality, or, on the con-

trary, the artificially restricted nature, of the fundamental suppositions as to
the state of things, but only the degree to which the results are in accordance
with observed facts. But as regards the third wave the case is very different.
That theory should point to the necessary existence of such a wave consisting

of strictly normal vibrations, and yet to which no known phenomenon can be

referred, is bad enough ; but in the present theory the vibrations are not
even strictly normal, except for waves in a direction perpendicular to any one

of the principal axes. In Iceland spar, for instance, for waves propagated in

a direction inclined 45° to the axis, it follows from the numerical values of

Dthe refractive indices for the fixed line given by Rudberg that the two

vibrations in the principal plane which can be propagated independently of

each other are inclined at angles of 9° 50' and 80° 10', or say 10° and 80°, to

Wethe wave-normal.    can hardly suppose that a mere change of inclination

in the direction of vibration of from 10° to 80° with the wave front makes all

the difference whether the wave belongs to a long-known and evident pheno-

menon, no other than the ordinary refraction in Iceland spar, or not to any

visible phenomenon at all.

It is true that before there can be any question of the third wave's being

perceived it must be supposed excited, and the means of exciting it consist in

the incident vibrations in air, which by hypothesis are strictly transversal.

Hence we have to inquire whether the intensity of the third wave is such as
to lead us to expect a sensible phenomenon answering to it. This leads us to

the still more uncertain subject of the intensity of light reflected or refracted

--at the surface of a crystal more uncertain because it not only depends on

the laws of internal propagation, and involves all the hypotheses on which

these laws are theoretically deduced, but requires fresh hypotheses as to the

state of things at the confines of two media, introducing thereby fresh elements

of uncertainty. But for our present purpose no exact calculation of intensities

is required ; a rough estimate of the intensity of the nearly normal vibrations

is quite sufficient.

In order to introduce as little as possible relating to the theory of the in-

tensity of reflected and refracted fight, suppose the incident light to fall per-

pendicularly on the surface of a crystal, and let this be a surface of Iceland
spar cut at an inclination of 45° to the axis. For a cleavage plane the result
would be nearly the same. Let the incident fight be polarized, and the

vibrations be in the principal plane, which therefore, according to the theory

now under consideration, must be the plane of polarization. The incident

vibrations are parallel to the surface, and accordingly inclined at angles of

9° 50' and 80° 10' to the directions of the nearly transversal and nearly nor-
mal vibrations, respectively, within the crystal. Hence it seems evident that
the amplitude of the latter must be of the order of magnitude of sin 9° 50',

ior about the amplitude of vibration in the incident light being taken as

unity. The velocity of propagation of the nearly normal vibrations being to

that of the nearly transversal roughly as \^3 to 1, as will immediately be

shown, it follows that the vis viva of the nearly normal would be to that

of the nearly transversal vibrations in a ratio comparable with that of

^\Z3xsin2 9° 50' to 1, or about to 1. Hence the intensity of the nearly

normal vibrations is by no means insignificant, and therefore it is a very

serious objection to the theory that no corresponding phenomenon should

have been discovered. It has been suggested by some of the advocates of

this theory that the normal vibrations may correspond to heat. But the fact

of the polarization of heat at once negatives such a supposition, even without

insisting on the accumulation of evidence in favour of the identity of radiant

heat and light of the same refrangibility.

But the objections to the theory on the ground of the absence of some un-

known phenomenon corresponding with the third ray, to which the theory

necessarily conducts, are not the only ones which may be urged against it in

connexion with that ray. The existence of normal or nearly normal vibra-

tions entails consequences respecting the transversal which could hardly fail

to have been detected by observation. In the first place, the vis viva belong-

ing to the normal vibrations is so much abstracted from the transversal, which

alone by hypothesis constitute light, so that there is a loss of light inherent

in the very act of passage from air into the crystal, or conversely, from the

crystal into air. About -^th of the whole might thus be expected to be lost

at a single surface of Iceland spar, the surface being inclined 45° to the axis,

and the light being incident perpendicularly, and being polarized in the prin-

cipal plane ; and the loss would amount to somewhere about ^th in passage

across a plate bounded by parallel surfaces, by which amount the sum of

the reflected and transmitted light ought to fall short of the incident. And

it is evident that something of the same kind must take place at other inch-

nations to the axis and at other incidences. The loss thus occasioned in mul-

tiplied reflexions could hardly have escaped observation, though it is not quite

so great as might at first sight appear, as the transversal vibrations produced

back again by the normal would presently become sensible.

But the most fatal objection of all is that urged by Green* against the

supposition that normal vibrations could be propagated with a velocity com-

parable with those of transversal. As transversal vibrations are capable

(according to the suppositions here combated) of giving rise at incidence on a

medium to normal or nearly normal vibrations within it, so conversely the

latter on arriving at the second surface are capable of giving rise to emergent

transversal vibrations ; so that not only would normal vibrations entail a loss

of light in the quarter in which light is looked for, but would give rise to

light (of small intensity it is true, but by no means imperceptible) iu a quar-

ter in which otherwise there would have been none at all. Thus in the case

supposed above, the intensity of the light produced by nearly normal vibra-

tions giving rise on emergence to transversal vibrations would be somewhere

about  the  (-al8    2  or  the  -^^  of .the  incident  light.  In the case of light trans-

 mitted through a plate, the rays thus produced would be parallel to the inci-
 dent, or to the emergent rays of the kind usually considered ; but if the plate
 were wedge-shaped the two would come out in different directions, and with

sunlight the former could not fail to be perceived. The only way apparently
 of getting over this difficulty, is by making the perfectly gratuitous assumption

that the medium, though perfectly transparent for the more nearly transversal
vibrations, is intensely opaque for those more nearly normal.

     Lastly, Green's argument respecting the necessity of supposing the velocity
 of propagation of normal vibrations very great has here full force as an

 Robjection against this theory. The constants P, Q, are the squared reci-

 procals of the three principal indices of refraction, which are given by obser-

N Rvation, and L, M, are determined in terms of P, Q, by the equations (2),

by the solution of a quadratic equation. In the case of a uniaxal crystal
everything is symmetrical about one of the axes, suppose that of z, which

requires, as Cauchy has shown, that L=M=3R, and P=Q; and of the

equations (2) one is now satisfied identically, and the two others are identical

with each other, and give

                                                          4P 2

                                      ^3R-P
For an isotropic medium we must have L=M=N=3P=3Q=3R, and the

three equations (2) are satisfied identically. The velocity of propagation of
normal must be to that of transversal vibrations as \/3 to 1, and cannot

therefore be assumed to be what may be convenient for explaining the law of

intensity of reflected light.

    The theory which has just been discussed is essentially bound up with the

supposition that in polarized light the vibrations are parallel, not perpendicu-
lar, to the plane of polarization. In prosecuting the study of light, Cauchy

saw reason to change his views in this respect, and was induced to examine
whether his theory could not be modified so as to be in accordance with the

latter alternative. The result, constituting what may be called Cauchy's
second theory, is contained in a memoir read' before the Academy, May 20,

1839*. In this he refers to his memoir on dispersion, in which the funda-
mental equations are obtained in a manner somewhat different from that given
in his ' Exercices,' but based on the same suppositions as to the constitution
of the ether. In the new theory Cauchy retains the three constants G, H, I,
expressing the pressures in equilibrium, which formerly he made vanish, the
medium being supposed as before to be symmetrical with respect to three
rectangular planes. The squares of the velocities of propagation, and the
corresponding directions of vibration for the three waves which can be pro-
pagated in the direction of each of the principal axes, are given by the fol-

lowing Table.
                 ON DOUBLE REFRACTION.                         259

    According to observation, in each of the principal planes the ray polarized

in that plane obeys the ordinary law of refraction, and therefore if we suppose

that in polarized light the vibrations, at least when strictly transversal, are

perpendicular to the plane of polarization, we must assume that R-f-H=(J4-I,

Q+G=PP + I=R+G,  + H, which are equivalent to only two distinct rela-

tions, namely

               P_G=Q-H=R-I                                     (3)

   For a wave parallel to one of the principal axes, as that of x, the direction
of that axis is one of the three rectangular directions of vibration of the waves
which are propagated independently. For such vibrations the velocity (v) of

propagation is given by the formula

                       = + +mv2 2 (R H) n2 (Q 1),

which by (3) is reduced to

                        i>2 =R+H=Q+I,

so that on the assumption that the velocity of propagation is the same for a
wave perpendicular to the axis of y as for one perpendicular to the axis of

z when the vibrations are parallel to the axis of x, the law of ordinary re-

fraction in the plane of yz follows from theory.
   For the two remaining waves which can be propagated independently in a

given direction perpendicular to the axis of x, the vibrations are only approxi-
mately normal and transversal respectively. In fact, for the three waves

which can travel independently in any given direction, the directions of vibra-

tion are not affected by the introduction of the constants expressing equili-

brium-pressures, but only the velocities of propagation. The squares of the

velocities of propagation of the two waves above mentioned are given as be-

fore by a quadratic ; and in order that the velocity of propagation of the

nearly transversal vibrations may be expressed by the formula

                 22  b2 2                                      (4),

in conformity with the ellipsoidal form of the extraordinary wave surface in
a uniaxal crystal, and the assumed elliptic form of the section of one sheet of

the wave-surface in a biaxal crystal by a principal plane, the quadratic in
question must split into two rational factors, which leads to precisely the
same condition as before, namely that expressed by the first of equations (2) ;
and by equating to zero the corresponding factor, we get

                         ^2 =(P + H)m2 + (P + I)»i2,

which is in fact of the form (4). Applying the same to each of the other

principal axes, we find again the three relations (2).

    Hence Cauchy's second theory, in which it is supposed that in polarized
light the vibrations (in air or in an isotropic medium) are perpendicular to
the plane of polarization, leads like the first to laws of double refraction, and
of the accompanying polarization, differing from those of Fresnel only by

quantities which may be deemed insensible. This result is, however, in the

present case only attained by the aid of two sets of forced relations, namely
(2) and (3), that is, relations which there is nothing a priori to indicate, and
which are not the expression of any simple physical idea, but are obtained by
forcing the theory, which in its original state is of a highly plastic nature
from the number of arbitrary constants which it contains, to agree with
observation in some particulars, which being done, theory by itself makes
known the rest. As regards the third ray by which this theory like its pre-

decessor is hampered, there is nearly as much to be urged against the present

theory as the former. There is, however, this difference, that, as there are
only five relations, (2) and (3), between nine arbitrary constants, there remains

                                                                                                     s2

one arbitrary constant in the expressions for the velocities of propagation
after satisfying the numerical values of the three principal indices of refrac-
tion, by a proper disposal of which the objections which have been mentioned

may to a certain extent be lessened, but by no means wholly overcome.
   I come now to Green's theory, contained in a very remarkable memoir " On

the Propagation of Light in Crystallized Media," read before the Cambridge

Philosophical Society, May 20, 1839*, and accordingly, by a curious coinci-

dence, the very day that Cauchy's second theory was presented to the French
Academy. Besides the great interest of the memoir in relation to the theory
of light, Green has in it, as I conceive, given for the first time the true
equations of equilibrium and motion of a homogeneous elastic solid slightly
disturbed from its position of equilibrium, which is one of constraint under a
uniform pressure different in different directions. In a former memoirf he
had given the equations for the case in which the undisturbed state is one

free from pressure J. When I speak of the true equations, I mean the equations

which belong to the problem when not restricted in generality by arbitrarily

assumed hypotheses, and yet not containing constants which are incompatible
with any well- ascertained physical principle. It is right to mention, however,
that on this point mathematicians are not agreed ; M. de Saint-Venant, for
instance, maintains the justice of the more restricted equations given by

Cauchy§, though even he would not conceive the latter equations applicable

to such solids as caoutchouc or jelly.
    In these papers Green introduced into the treatment of the subject, with

the greatest advantage, the method of Lagrange, in which the partial differ-

ential equations of motion are obtained from the variation of a single force-
function, on the discovery of the proper form of which everything turns.

--Green's principle is thus enunciated by him : " In whatever manner the

elements of any material system may act on each other, if all the internal

forces be multiplied by the elements of their respective directions, the total

sum for any assigned portion of the mass will always be the exact differential

of some function." In accordance with this principle, the general equation

may be put under the form

    ^*'**(»»^S fc+ar , ")-JH***»» · <5>>
where x, y, z are the equilibrium coordinates of any particle, p the density

win equilibrium, u, v,                                  the displacements parallel to x, y, z, and <p the

function in question. <p is in fact the function the variation of which in
passing from one state of the medium to another, when multiplied by dx cly dz,

expresses the work given out by the portion of the medium occupying in

equilibrium the elementary parallelepiped dx dy dz, in passing from the first

state to the second. The portion of the medium which in the state of equili-

brium occupied the elementary parallelepiped becomes in the changed state an

oblique-angled parallelepiped, whose edges maybe represented by dx(l-\-s^),

dy  (l+s                ),  dz  (l+s                ),  and  the  cosines  of  the  angles  between  the  second  and

second order, contains in its most general shape twenty-one arbitrary con-

stants, and <p l which is of the first order introduces six more, so that the most
general expression for <p contains no less than twenty-seven arbitrary

constants, all which appear in the expressions for the internal pressures and

in the partial differential equations of motion*.

The general expressions for the internal tensions in an elastic medium and

the general equations of equilibrium or motion which were given by Cauchy,
and which are written at length in the 4th volume of the ' Exercices de Mathe'-

matiques,' contain twenty-one arbitrary constantswhen the undisturbed state of

the medium is one of uniform constraint, and fifteen when it is one of freedom

from pressure. In the latter case, Green's twenty-one constants are reduced

to two, and Cauchy 's fifteen to only one, when the medium is isotropic.

Green's equations comprise Cauchy's as a particular case, as will be shown
more at length further on. It becomes an important question to inquire
whether Cauchy's equations involve some restrictive hypothesis as to the
constitution of the medium, so as to be in fact of insufficient generality, or
whether, on the other hand, Green's equations are reducible to Cauchy's by

the introduction of some well-ascertained physical principle, and therefore

contain redundant constants.

In the formation of Cauchy's equations, not only is the medium supposed

to consist of material points acting on one another by forces which depend on

the distance only (a supposition which, at least when coupled with the next,

excludes the idea of molecular polarity), but it is assumed that the displace-
ments of the individual molecules vary from molecule to molecide according

to the variation of some continuous function of the coordinates ; and accordingly

the displacements u', v', w' of the molecule whose coordinates in equilibrium

+are x+Ax, y+Ay, z Az are expanded by Taylor's theorem in powers of.

as to be there equivalent to only twenty-sis distinct constants, the physical interpretation
of which analytical result will be found to be that a uniform pressure alike in all directions,

ments when the medium is disturbed as a certain internal elasticity, alike in all directions,
and of a very simple kind, which is possible in a medium unconstrained in its natural state.

a whole, or in other words the mean motion, in any direction, of the molecules
in the neighbourhood of a given point, must not be confounded with the
motion of the molecules taken individually. The medium being continuous,

so far as anything relating' to observation is concerned, the former will vary
Continuously from point to point. But it by no means follows that the motion
of the molecules considered individually should vary from one to another

according to some function of the coordinates. The motion of the individual
molecules is only considered for the sake of deducing results from hypotheses
as to the molecular constitution and molecular forces of the medium, and in

it we are concerned only with the relative motion of molecules situated so

close as to act sensibly on each other. It would seem to be veiy probable,
a priori, that a portion by no means negligible of the relative displacement
of a pair of neighbouring molecules shoidd vary in an irregular manner from
pair to pair ; and indeed if the medium tends to relieve itself from a state of
 constrained distortion, this must necessarily be the case ; and such a re-
 arrangement must assuredly take place in fluids. The insufficient generality
 of Cauchy's equations is further shown by their being absolutely incompatible

with the idea of incompressibility. "We may evidently conceive a solid which

 resists compression of volume by a force incomparably greater than that by
 which it resists distortion of figure, and such a conception is actually realized

 in such a solid as caoutchouc or jelly.

    I have not mentioned the hypothesis of what may be called, from the

 analogy of surfaces of the second order, a central arrangement of the molecules,
 that is, an arrangement such that each molecule is a centre with respect to
 which the others are arranged in pairs at equal distances in opposite directions,

 because the hypothesis was merely casually introduced as one mode of making
 certain terms vanish which are of a form that clearly ought not to appear in
 the expressions relating to the mean motion, with which alone we are ulti-

  mately concerned.
     The arguments in favour of the existence of ultimate molecules in the case

  of ponderable matter appear to rest chiefly on the chemical law of definite
  proportions, and on the laws of crystallography, neither of which of course

  can be assumed to apply to the mysterious ether, of the very existence of

 which we have no direct evidence. If, for aught we know to the contrary,

  the very supposition of the existence of xdtimate molecules as applied to the

  ether may entail consequences at variance with its real constitution, much

  more must the accessory hypotheses be deemed precarious which Cauchy
  found necessary in order to be able to deduce any results at all in proceeding
  by his method. There appears, therefore, no sufficient reason a priori for
  preferring the more limited equations of Cauchy to the more general equations

   of Green.

      Green, on the other hand, takes his stand on the impossibility of perpetual
  motion, or in other words, on the principle of the conservation of work, which

  we have the strongest reasons for believing to be a general physical princi-

  ple*. The number of arbitrary constants thus furnished in the case in which
  the undisturbed state of the medium is one of freedom from pressure is, as
  has been stated, twenty- one. Professor Thomson has recently put this

   result in a form which indicates more clearly the signification of the con-

  stants t, and at the end of his memoir promises to show how an elastic solid,

which as a whole should possess this number of arbitrary constants, could be
built up of isotropic matter.

   Green supposes, in the first instance, that the medium is symmetrical with
respect to planes in three rectangular directions, which simplifies the investi-

gation and reduces the twenty-seven or twenty-one arbitrary constants to
twelve (entering the partial differential equations of motion in such a manner

as to be there equivalent to only eleven) or nine. It may be useful to give a

Table of the constants employed by Green, with their equivalents in the theo-
ries of Cauchy and Neumann, the density of the medium at rest being taken
equal to unity for the sake of simplicity. The Table is as follows :

from pressure is first considered*. Green shows that the ellipse which is the
section of the ellipsoid of elasticity by a diametral plane, parallel to the wave's
front, if turned 90° in its own plane, belongs to a fixed ellipsoid, which gives
at once Fresnel's elegant construction for the velocity of propagation and
direction of the plane of polarization ; but it is necessary to suppose that in
polarized light the vibrations are parallel, not perpendicular, to the plane of

polarization.

   The general case in which the medium is not assumed to be symmetrical with
respect to three rectangular planes, and in which therefore $ contains twenty-
one arbitrary constants, is afterwards considered ; and it is shown that the

hypothesis of strict transversality leads to fourteen relations between them,
leaving only seven constants arbitrary. But the function obtained on the
assumption of planes of symmetry contains no fewer, for the four constants

relating to these planes would be increased by three when the medium was
referred to general axes. Hence therefore the existence of planes of symmetry

is not an independent assumption, as in Cauchy's theory, but follows as a

result.

   In this beautiful theory, therefore, we are presented with no forced rela-

tions like Cauchy's equations; the result follows from the hypothesis of
strictly transversal vibrations, to which Fresnel was led by physical considera-
tions. The constant /x remains arbitrary, and it is easy to see that this
constant expresses the square of the velocity of propagation of normal vibra-

tions. Were this velocity comparable with the velocity of propagation of

transversal vibrations, theory would lead us still to expect normal vibrations
to be produced by light incident obliquely, though not by light incident
perpendicidarly, on the surface of a crystal, and the theory would still be

exposed to many of the objections which have been already brought forward.

But nothing hinders us from supposing, in accordance with the argument
contained in Green's former paper, that p. is very great or sensibly infinite,
which removes all the difficulty, since the motion corresponding to this term

--in the expression for 2 woidd not be sensible except at a distance from
                                                                                     ty

the surface comparable with the length of a wave of light. Hence, although
it might be said, so long as p was supposed arbitrary, that the supposition of
rigorous transversality had still something in it of the nature of a forced
relation between constants, we see that the single supposition of incompressi-
bility (under the action of forces at least comparable with those acting in the

-- --propagation of light) the original supposition of Fresnel introduced into

the general equations, suffices to lead to the complete laws of double refrac-

tion as given by Fresnel. "Were it not that other phenomena of light lead us

rather to the conclusion that the vibrations are perpendicular, than that they
are parallel to the plane of polarization, this theory would seem to leave us

nothing to desire, except to prove that we had a right to neglect the direct

action of the ponderable molecules, and to treat the ether within a crystal as
a single elastic medium, of which the elasticity was different in different

directions.

    In his paper on Reflexion, Green had adopted the supposition of Fresnel,

that the vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of polarization. He was

naturally led to examine whether the laws of double refraction could be

explained on this hypothesis. When the medium in its undisturbed state is

exposed to pressure differing in different directions, six additional constants

are introduced into the function <jt, or three in case of the existence of planes

even conveying when pointed out the expression of any simple physical

relation.

The year .1839 was fertile in theories of doiible refraction, and on the 9th

of December Prof. MacCullagh presented his theory to the Royal Irish Academy.

It is contained in " An Essay towards a Dynamical Theory of Crystalline

Reflexion and Refraction"*. As indicated by the title, the determination of

the intensities of the light reflected and refracted at the surface of a crystal is

what the author had chiefly in view, but his previous researches had led him

to observe that this determination was intimately connected with the laws of

double refraction, and to seek to link together these laws as parts of the same

system. He was led to apply to the problem the general equation of dynamics

under the form (5), to seek to determine the form of the function <p (V in his

notation), and then to form the partial differential equations of motion, and the

conditions to be satisfied at the boundaries of the medium, by the method of

Lagrange. He does not appear to have been aware at the time that this method

had previously been adopted by Green. Like his predecessors, he treats the

ether within a crystallized body as a single medium unequally elastic in dif-

ferent directions, thus ignoring any direct influence of the ponderable mole-

cules in the vibrations. He assumes that the density of the ether is a constant

quantity, that is, both unchanged during vibration, and the same within all

Webodies as in free space.  are not concerned with the latter of these

suppositions in deducing the laws of internal vibrations, but only in investi-

gating those which regulate the intensity of reflected and refracted light.

He assumes further that the vibrations in plane waves, propagated within a

crystal, are rectilinear, and that while the plane of the wave moves parallel to

itself the vibrations continue parallel to a fixed right hue, the direction of this,

--right line and the direction of a normal to the wave being functions of each

other, a supposition which doubtless applies to all crystals except quartz, and
those which possess a similar property.

   In this method everything depends on the correct determination of the form

of the function V. From the assumption that the density of the ether is
unchanged by vibration, it is readily shown that the vibrations are entirely

transversal. Imagine a system of plane waves, in which the vibrations are

parallel to a fixed line in the plane of a wave, to be propagated in the crystal,

and refer the crystal for a moment to the rectangular axes of x', y', z', the

plane of x'y being parallel to the planes of the waves, and the axis of y' to

the direction of vibration ; and let c be the angle whose tangent is -jy With

-- Vrespect to the form of Y, MacCullagh reasons thus : " The function can only

depend upon the directions of the axes of x', y', z' with respect to fixed lines

in the crystal, and upon the angle which measures the change of form produced

in the parallelepiped by vibration. This is the most general supposition which

can be made concerning it. Since, however, by our second supposition, any
one of these directions, suppose that of x', determines the other two, we may

X, Y, Z, denned by the equations

This reasoning, which is somewhat obscure, seems to me to involve a fallacy.

VIf the form of were known, the rectilinearity of vibration and the constancy

in the direction of vibration for a system of plane waves travelling in any given

direction would follow as a result of the solution of the problem. But in using

Yequation (5) we are not at liberty to substitute for (or an<j>) expression

which represents that function only on the condition that the motion be luhat it

actually is, for we have occasion to take the variation cV of V, and this varia-

tion must be the most general that is geometrically possible though it be

dynamically impossible. That the form of V, arrived at by MacCullagh, is

inadmissible, is, I conceive, proved by its incompatibility with the form

deduced by Green from the very same supposition of theperfect transversality

of the transversal vibrations ; for Green's reasoning is perfectly straightforward

and irreproachable. Besides, MacCullagh's form leads to consequences abso-

lutely at variance with dynamical principles*.

VBut waiving for the present the objection to the conclusion that is a

function of the quantities X, Y, Z, let us follow the consequences of the theory.

The disturbance being supposed small, the quantities X, Y, Z will also be small,

Yand may be expanded in a series according to powers of these quantities

and, as before, we need only proceed to the second order if we regard the

disturbance as indefinitely small. The first term, being merely a constant,
may be omitted. The terms of the first order MacCullagh concludes must

vanish. This, however, it must be observed, is only true on the supposition

that the medium in its undisturbed state is free from pressure. The terms of

the second order are six in number, involving squares and products of X, Y, Z.

independently of, and in a different manner from Green, precisely Fresnel's
laws of double refraction and the accompanying polarization, on the condition,

however, that in polarized light the vibrations are parallel to the plane of

polarization.

    It is remarkable that in the previous year MacCullagh, in a letter to

Sir David Brewster*, published expressions for the internal pressures identical
with those which result from Green's first theory, provided that in the latter
the terms be omitted which arise from that term in which contains p, a
term which vanishes in the case of transversal vibrations propagated within

a crystal. It does not appear how these expressions were obtained by

MacCullagh ; it was probably by a tentative process.
   The various theories which have just been reviewed have this one feature

in common, that in all, the direct action of the ponderable molecules ia
neglected, and the ether treated as a single vibrating medium. It was,
doubtless, the extreme difficulty of determining the motion of one of two
mutually penetrating media that led mathematicians to adopt this, at first
sight, unnatural supposition ; but the conviction seems by some to have been
entertained from the first, and to have forced itself upon the minds of others,
that the ponderable molecules must be taken into account in a far more direct
manner. Some investigations were made in this direction by Dr. Lloyd as long-
as twenty-five years agof. Cauchy's later papers show that he was dissatisfied
with the method, adopted in his earlier ones, of treating the ether within a
ponderable body as a single vibrating medium^ ; but he does not seem to
have advanced beyond a few barren generalities, towards a theory of double
refraction founded on a calculation of the vibrations of one of two mutually
penetrating media. In the theory of double refraction advanced by Professor
Challis§, the ether is assimilated to an ordinary elastic fluid, the vibrations of
which are modified by resisting masses ; and his theory leads him at once to
Fresnel's elegant construction of the wave surface by points. The theory,
however, rests upon principles which have not received the general assent of
mathematicians. In a work entitled " Light explained on the Hypothesis of
the Ethereal Medium being a Viscous Fluid "||, Mr. Moon has put in a clear

form some of the more serious objections which may be raised against Fresnel's

theory ; but that which he has substituted is itself open to formidable objec-
tions, some of which the author himself seems to have perceived.

   In concluding this part of the subject, I may perhaps be permitted to

express my own belief that the true dynamical theory of double refraction

has yet to be found.
    In the present state of the theory of double refraction, it appears to be of

especial importance to attend to a rigorous comparison of its laws with actual

observation. I have not now in view the two great laws giving the planes

of polarization, and the difference of the squared velocities of propagation, of
the two waves which can be propagated independently of each other in any
given direction within a crystal. These laws, or at least laws differing from

them only by quantities which may be deemed negligible in observation, had

previously been discovered by experiment ; and the deduction of these laws
by Fresnel from his theory, combined with the verification of the law, which

his theory, correcting in this respect previous notions, first pointed out, that

in each principal plane of a biaxal crystal the ray polarized in that plane

obeys the ordinary law of refraction, leaves no reasonable doubt that Fresnel's
construction contains the true laws of double refraction, at least in their broad
features. But regarding this point as established, I have rather in view a
verification of those laws which admit of being put to the test of experiment
with extreme precision ; for such verifications might often enable the mathe-

matician, in groping after the true theory, to discard at once, as not agreeing
with observation, theories which might present themselves to his mind, and

on which otherwise he might have spent much fruitless labour.

   To make my meaning clearer, I will refer to Fresnel's construction, in

which the laws of polarization and wave-velocity are determined by the
sections, by a diametral plane parallel to the wave-front, of the ellipsoid *

                               aV+&V+fiV=l                                                  (11),

where a, b, c denote the principal wave-velocities. The principal semiaxes
of the section determine by their direction the normals to the two planes of

polarization, and by their magnitude the reciprocals of the corresponding

wave-velocities. Now a certain other physical theory which might be pro-

posed leads to a construction differing from Fresnel's only in this, that the
planes of polarization and wave-velocities are determined by the section, by

a diametral plane parallel to the wave-front, of the ellipsoid

                                             2 22                                           (12),

                                          ^2 + ^2+^ = 1

the principal semiaxes of the section determining by their direction the

normals to- the two planes of polarization, and by their magnitudes the

corresponding wave-velocities. The law that the planes of polarization of

the two waves propagated in a given direction bisect respectively the two

supplemental dihedral angles made by planes passing through the wave-

normal and the two optic axes, remains tbe same as before, but the posi-

tions of the optic axes themselves, as determined by the principal indices

of refraction, are somewhat different ; the difference, however, is but small

if  the  differences  between  a2         b2,    2  are  a  good  deal  smaller  than  the  quantities

                                               c

themselves. Each principal section of the wave surface, instead of being a

circle and an ellipse, is a circle and an oval, to which an ellipse is a near

approximation f. The difference between the inclinations of the optic axes,

and between the amounts of extraordinary refraction in the principal planes,

on the two theories, though small, are quite sensible in observation, but only

Weon condition that the observations are made with great precision.                         see

from this example of what great advantage for the advancement of theory

observations of this character may be.

    One law which admits of receiving, and which has received, this searching

comparison with observation, is that according to which, in each principal

plane of a biaxal crystal, the ray which is polarized in that plane obeys the

ordinaiy law of refraction, and accordingly in a uniaxal crystal, in which

every plane parallel to the axis is a principal plane, the so-called ordinary

ray follows rigorously the law of ordinary refraction. This law was carefully

verified by Fresnel himself in the case of topaz, by the method of cutting

plates parallel to the same principal axis, or axis of elasticity, carefully

   * It would seem to be just as well to omit the surface of elasticity altogether, and refer

the construction directly to the ellipsoid (11).

and Motion of Solid and Fluid Bodies." Transactions of the Eoyal Irish Academy, vol. xxi.

working them to the same thickness, and then interposing them in the paths
 of two streams of light proceeding to interfere, as well as by the method of
prismatic refraction ; and he states as the result of his observations that he
can affirm the law to be, at least in the case of topaz, mathematically exact.
The same result follows from the observations by which Rudberg so accu-
rately determined tbe principal indices of Arragonite and topaz *, for the
principal fixed lines of the spectrum. Professor MacCullagh having been led
by theoretical considerations to doubt whether, in Iceland spar for instance,'
the so-called ordinary ray rigorously obeyed the ordinary law of refraction,
whether the refractive indices in the axial and equatorial directions were
strictly the same, Sir David Brewster was induced to put the question to the
test of a crucial experiment, by forming a compound prism consisting of two
pieces of spar cemented together in the direction of the length of the prism,
and so cut from the crystal that at a minimum deviation one piece was tra-
versed axially and the other equatoriallyt. Tbe prism having been polished
after cementing, so as to ensure the perfect equality of angle of the two parts,

Don viewing a slit through it the bright line was seen unbroken in passing

from one half to the other. More recently Professor Swan has made a very

precise examination of the ordinary refraction in various directions in Iceland
spar by the method of prismatic refraction J, from whence it results that for
homogeneous light of any refrangibility the ordinary ray follows strictly the
ordinary law of refraction.

    It is remarkable that this simple law, which ought, one woidd expect, to
lie on the very surface as it were of the true theo.y of double refraction, is
not indicated a priori by most of the rigorous theories which have been ad-
vanced to account for the phenomenon. Neither of the two theories of Cauchy,
nor the second theory of Green, lead us to expect such a result, though they

furnish arbitrary constants which may be so determined as to bring it about.
   The curious and unexpected phenomenon of conical refraction has justly

been regarded as one of the most striking proofs of the general correctness of
the conclusions residting from the theory of Fresnel. But I wish to point
out that the phenomenon is not competent to decide between several theories
leading to Fresnel's construction as a near approximation. Let us take first
internal conical refraction. The existence of this phenomenon depends upon
the existence of a tangent plane touching the wave surface along a plane
curve. At first sight this might seem to be a speciality of the wave-surface
of Fresnel ; but a little consideration will show that it must be a property of
the wave surface resulting from any reasonable theory. For, if possible, let
the nearest approach to a plane curve of contact be a curve of double curva-

ture. Let a plane be drawn touching the rim (as it may be called) of the

surface, that is, the part where the surface turns over, in two points, on
opposite sides of the rim ; and then, after having been slightly tilted by
turning about one of the points of contact, let it move parallel to itself towards

12the centre. The successive sections of the wave-surface by this plane will

evidently be of the general character represented in the annexed figures,

and in four positions the plane will touch the surface in one point, as repre-

&sented in figs. 1, 2, 4, 5. Should the contacts represented in figs. 4 5 take

place simultaneously, they may be rendered successive by slightly altering

the inclination of the plane. Hence in certain directions there would be four

Nowpossible wave-velocities.    the general principle of the superposition of

small motions makes the laws of double refraction depend on those of the

propagation of plane waves. But all theories respecting the propagation of a

"series of plane waves having a given direction, and in which the disturbance

of the particles is arbitrary, but the same all over the front of a wave, agree

in this, that they lead us to decompose the disturbance into three disturbances

in three particular directions, to each of which corresponds a series of plare

waves which are propagated with a determinate velocity. If the medium be

incompressible, one of the wave-velocities becomes infinite, and one sheet of

the wave surface moves off to infinity. The most general disturbance,

subject to the condition of incompressibility, which requires that there be no

displacements perpendicular to the fronts of the waves, may now be expressed

as the resultant of two disturbances, corresponding to displacements in parti-

cular directions lying in planes parallel to that of the waves, to each of

Wewhich corresponds a determinate velocity of propagation.  see, therefore,

that the limitation of the number of tangent planes to the wave-surface,

which can be drawn in a given direction on one side of the centre, to two, or

at the most three, is intimately bound up with the number of dimensions of

space ; so that the existence of the phenomenon of internal conical refraction

is no proof of the truth of the particular form of wave-surface assigned by

Fresnel rather than that to which some other theory would conduct. Were

the law of wave-velocity expressed, for example, by the construction already

mentioned having reference to the elhpsoid (12), the wave-surface (in this

case a surface of the 16th degree) woidd still have plane cuiTes of contact

with the tangent plane, which in this case also, as in the wave-surface of

Fresnel, are, as I find, circles, though that they should be circles could not

have been foreseen.

The existence of external conical refraction depends upon the existence of

a conical point in the wave-siu-face, by which the interior sheet passes to the

exterior. The existence of a conical point is not, like that of a plane curve of

contact, a necessary property of a wave-surface. Still it will readily be con-

ceived that if Fresnel's wave-surface be, as it undoubtedly is, at least a near

approximation to the true wave-surface, and if the latter have, moreover,

plane curves of contact with the tangent plane, the mode by which the

exterior sheet passes within one of these plane curves into the interior will

be very approximately by a conical point ; so that in the impossibility of

operating experimentally on mere rays the phenomena will not be sensibly

different from what they woidd have been had the transition been made

rigorously by a conical point.

There is one direction within a biaxal crystal marked by a visible

phenomenon of such a nature as to permit of observing the direction with

precision, while it can also be calculated, on any particidar theory of double

refraction, in terms of the principal indices of refraction ; I refer to the

direction of either optic axis. Eudberg himself measured the inclination of

the optic axes of Arragonite, probably with a piece of the same crystal
from which his prisms were cut, and found it a little more than 32° as

observed in air, but he speaks of the difficulty of measuring the angle with

precision. The inclination within the crystal thence deduced is really a little

greater than that given by Fresnel's theory ; but in making the comparison
272 report--1862.

Rudberg used the formula for the ray-axes instead of that for the wave-axes,

which made the theoretical inclination in air appear about 2° greater than

Athe observed*.  very exact measure of the angle between the optic axes of

Arragonite for homogeneous light corresponding to the principal fixed hues

of the spectrum has recently been executed by Professor Kirchhoff f, by a
method which has the advantage of not making any supposition as to the

direction in which the crystal is cut. The angle observed in air was reduced

by calculation to the angle within the crystal, by means of Rudberg's indices

for the principal axis of mean elasticity ; and the result was compared with

the angle calculated from the formula of Fresnel, on substituting for the con-

stants therein contained the numerical values determined by Rudberg for all

the three principal axes. The angle reduced from that observed in air proved

to be from 13' to 20' greater than that calculated from Presnel's formula.

This small difference seems to be fairly attributable to errors in the indices,

arising from errors in the direction of cutting of the prisms employed by

Rudberg. The angle measured by Kirchhoff would seem to have been trust-

worthy to within a minute or less.

It is doubtful, however, how far we may trust to the identity of the

principal refractive indices in different specimens of the mineral. Chemical

analysis shows that Arragonite is not pure carbonate of lime, but contains a

variable though small proportion of other ingredients. To these variations

doubtless correspond variations in the refractive indices ; and De Senarmont
has shown how the inclination of the optic axes of minerals is liable to be

changed by the substitution one for another of isomorphous elements J. More-
over, M. Des Cloizeaux has recently shown that in felspar and some other

minerals, which bear a high temperature without apparent change, the

inclination of the optic axes is changed in a permanent manner by heat§

so that even perfect identity of chemical composition is not an absolute

guarantee of optical identity in two specimens of a mineral of a given kind.

The exactness of the spheroidal form assigned by Huygens to the sheet of

the wave-surface within Iceland spar corresponding to the extraordinary ray,

does not seem to have been tested to the same degree of rigour as the ordinary

refraction of the ordinary ray; for the methods employed by Wollaston|| and

Halus If for observing the extraordinary refraction can hardly bear comparison

for exactness with the method of prismatic refraction which has been applied

to the ordinary ray ; and observations on the absolute velocities of propagation

in different directions within biaxal crystals are still almost wholly wanting.

This has long been recognized as a desideratum, and it has been suggested

to employ for the purpose the displacement of fringes of interference. It

seems to me that a slight modification of the ordinary method of prismatic

refraction would be more convenient and exact.

Let the crystal to be examined be cut, unless natural faces or cleavage

planes answer the purpose, so as to have two planes inclined at an angle

suitable for the measure of refractions ; there being at least two natural

faces or cleavage-planes left undestroyed, so as to permit of an exact measure

of the directions of any artificial faces. The prism thus formed having been

mounted as usual, and placed in any azimuth, let the angle of incidence or

scope) be measured, by observing the light reflected from the surface, and like-

wise the deviation for several standard fixed lines in the spectrum of each

refracted pencil. Let the prism be now turned into a different azimuth, and the

deviations again observed, and so on. Each observation furnishes accurately

an angle of incidence and the corresponding angle of emergence ; for if a be

to the law of double refraction, or assuming amjthing beyond the truth of
Huycjens's principle, which, following directly from the general principle of

the superposition of small motions, lies at the very foundation of the whole

theory of undulations, we may at once deduce from the angles of incidence

and emergence the direction and velocity of propagation of the wave within

the prism. For if a plane wave be incident on a plane surface bounding a

by being at the same time planes of crystallographic symmetry, is a matter

needing experimental verification. However, as no anomaly, so far as I am

aware, has been discovered in the systems of rings seen with homogeneous
light around the optic axes of crystals of the oblique or anorthic system,
there is no reason for supposing that such planes do not exist.

Further Comparison of the Theories of Green, MacCullagh, and Cauchy.

  In a paper "Ona Classification of Elastic Media and the Laws of Plane

"Waves propagated through them," read before the Royal Irish Academy on the

8th of January, 1849*, Professor Haughton has made a comparative examina-

tion of different theories which have been advanced for determining the motion

of elastic media, more especially those which have been applied to the expla-

nation of the phenomena of light. Some of the results contained in this

Appendix have already been given by Professor Haughton ; in other instances

I have arrived at different conclusions. In such cases I have been careful to

mygive     reasons in detail.

Consider a homogeneous elastic medium, the parts of which act on one

another only with forces which are insensible at sensible distances, and which

in its undisturbed state is either free from pressure, or else subject to a
pressure or tension which is the same at all points, though varying with

the direction of the plane surface with reference to which it is estimated^

Let x, y, z be the coordinates of any particle in the undisturbed state, x+u,
y+v, z-\-w the coordinates in the disturbed state, and for simplicity take the

density in the undisturbed state as the unit of density. Then, according to

the method followed both by Green and MacCullagh, the motion of the

medium will be determined by the equation

           (d2u .    wd2 v ,
                               d2

           +dFdf Zu

where <j> is the function due to the elastic forces. To this equation must be

added, in case the medium be not unlimited, the terms relative to its boundaries.

   The function multiplied by dx dy dz expresses the work given out by the
                                                                               <f>

element dx dy dz in passing from the initial to the actual state if we assume,

as we may, the initial state for that in which 0=0. According to the sup-
position with which we started, that the internal forces are insensible at

sensible distances, the value of at any point must depend on the relative

displacements in the immediate neighbourhood of that point, as expressed by

the differential coefficients of u, v, iv with respect to x, y, z. For the present

let us make no other supposition concerning <p than this, that it is some

Weclosed surface S.  must previously add the terms due to the action of the

surrounding portion of the medium, which will evidently be of the form of a

double integral having reference to the surface S, an element of which we

may denote by c?S. Hence we must add to the right-hand side of equa-

tion (19)

where I, m, n are the direction-cosines of the element dS of the surface which
bounded the portion of the medium under consideration -when it was in its

undisturbed state. This expression leads us to contemplate the action of the

surrounding medium as a tension having a certain value referred to a unit of

parallel to the axes of x, y, z, they must be the coefficients of %u, Zv, ho under

on planes originally perpendicular to the axes of as, y, z, we have only to put

in succession 1=1, m=l, »=1, the other two cosines each time being equal

to zero.  If  then  P      T  x,  T      denote  the  components  in  the  direction  of  the

   The formulas hitherto employed are just the same whether we suppose the
disturbance small or not ; and we might express in terms of P^., T , &c. (and

wtherefore in terms of f), and of the differential coefficients of u, v, with

respect to x, y, and z, the components of the tension referred to a surface
given in the actual instead of the undisturbed state of the medium, without
supposing the disturbance small. As, however, the investigation is meant to
be applied only to small disturbances, it would only complicate the formulae
to no purpose to treat the disturbance as of arbitrary magnitude, and I shall
therefore regard it henceforth as indefinitely small.

   On this supposition we may expand according to powers of the small

quantities y-_, <Src, proceeding as far as the second order, the left-hand

member of (19) being of the second order as regards u, v, w. The formulae
(22) or (23) show that $ will or will not contain terms of the first order
according as the undisturbed state of the medium is one of uniform constraint,

or of freedom from pressure.
    In Green's first theory, and in the theory of MacCullagh, <p is supposed not

to contain terms of the fii-st order. Accordingly in considering the point
with respect to which these two theories are at issue, I shall suppose the

medium in its undisturbed state to be free from pressure. The tensions

P, Q, R, Fx, &c. will now be small quantities of the first order, so that in the
fornruhe (22) and (23) we may suppose the tensions referred to a unit of

surface in the actual or the undisturbed state of the medium indifferently,

and may moreover in these formula?, and in the expression for <f>, take x, y, z

for the actual or the original coordinates of a particle.

    Green assumes as self-evident that the value of <j> for any element, suppose
that which originally occupied the rectangular parallelepiped dx chj dz, must
depend only on the change of form of the element, and not on any mere

change of position in space. Any displacement which varies continuously

from point to point must change an elementary rectangular parallelepiped
into one which is oblique-angled, and the change of form is expressed by the

ratios of the lengths of the edges to the original lengths, and by the angles
which the edges make with one another or by their cosines. If the medium
were originally in a state of constraint, <p would contain terms of the first
order, and the expressions for the extensions of the edges and the cosines of

the angles would be wanted to the second order, but when is wholly of the

second order, those quantities need only be found to the first order. It is easy
to see that to this order the extensions are expressed by

and <p being a function of these six quantities, we have from (23)      (26)

                 T,,=1V T,,=T«, T^=Tyx

These are the relations pointed out by Cauchy between the nine components

of the three tensions in three rectangular directions, whereby they are reduced
to six. The necessity of these relations is admitted by most mathematicians.

   Conversely, if we start with Cauchy's three relations (26), we have from (23)

/=aJ  function  of  -y- +-j-  and  of  the  seven  other  differential  coefficients.

                    ay dz

Substituting in the second of equations (27) and integrating, and substituting

the result in the third and integrating again, we readily find

              /=a function of the six quantities (24) and (25).
  We see then that Green's axiom that the function q, depends only on the

change of form of the element, and Cauchy's relations (26), are but different
ways of expressing the same condition ; so that either follows if the truth of
the other be admitted.

    Cauchy's equations were proved by applying the statical equations of
moments of a rigid body to an elementary parallelepiped of the medium, and
taking the limit when the dimensions of the element vanish. The demonstra-

tion is just the same whether the medium be at rest or in motion, since in
the latter case we have merely to apply d'Alembert's principle. It need
hardly be remarked that the employment of equations of equilibrium of
a rigid body in the demonstration by no means limits the truth of the

theorem to rigid bodies ; for the equations of equilibrium of a rigid body are
--278 report 1862.

true of any material system. In the latter case they are not sufficient for

the equilibrium, but all that we are concerned with in the demonstration of

equations (26) is that they should be true.

  YOn the other hand, the form of or to which MacCullagh was led is that

of a homogeneous function, of the second order, of the three quantities

                  dw dv du dw dv du                                              fi

                                                                         ^'

which, as is well known, are linear functions of the similarly expressed

quantities referring to any other system of rectangular axes. On substituting

in (23), we see that the normal tensions on planes parallel to the coordinate

planes, and therefore on any plane since the axes are arbitrary, vanish, while

the tangential tensions satisfy the three relations

                  -VT =-T
                     y2 sy ,
                  T«=-T,,,  T.,--                    · · · (29)

so that the equations of moments of an element are violated. The relative
motion in the neighbourhood of a given point may be resolved, as is known,

into three extensions (positive or negative) in three rectangular directions and
three rotations. The directions of the axes of extension, and the magnitudes

of the extensions, are determined by the six quantities (24) and (2o), while

the rotations or angular displacements are expressed by tbe halves of the three

quantities (28). In this theory, then, the work stored up in an element of the
medium would depend, not upon the change of form of the element, but upon

its angular displacement in space.

   It may be shown without difficulty that, according to the form of cp assumed

by MacCullagh, the equations of moments are violated for a finite portion of the

mass, and not merely for an element. Supposing for simplicity that the

medium in its undisturbed state is free from pressure or tension, let us leave

the form of <p open for the present, except that it is supposed to be a function

wof the differential coefficients of the first order of u, v, with respect to

x, y, z, and let us form the equation of moments roimd one of the axes, as
that of x, for the portion of the medium comprised within the closed surface S.

in the theory of MacCullagh.

The form of the equations such as (30) is instructive, as pointing out the

mode in which, the condition of moments is violated. It is not that the

resultant of the forces acting on an element of the medium does not produce

its proper momentum in changing the motion of translation of the element
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

that is secured by the equations (20) ; but that a couple is supposed to act

on each element to which there is no corresponding reacting couple.

   The only way of escaping from these conclusions is by denying that the
mutual action of two adjacent portions of the medium separated by a small

ideal surface is capable of being represented by a pressure or tension, and
saying that we must also take into account a couple ; not, it is to be observed, a

couple depending on variations of the tension (for that would be of a higher

order and would vanish in the limit), but a couple ultimately proportional to

the element of surface. But it would require a function $ of a totally different
form to take into account the work of such couples ; and indeed the method

by which the expressions for the components of the tension have been here

deduced seems to show that in the case of a function <j> which depends only on

wthe differential coefficients of the first order of u, v, with respect to x, y, z,

the mutual action of two contiguous portions of a medium is fully repre-

sented by a tension or pressure.

Indeed MacCullagh himself expressly disclaimed having given a mechanical

theory of double refraction*. His methods have been characterized as a sort
of mathematical induction, and led him to the discovery of the mathematical

laws of certain highly important optical phenomena. The discovery of such

laws can hardly fail to be a great assistance towards the future establishment

of a complete mechanical theory.

The general expressions for the tensions resulting from Cauchy's method

are written at length in the equations numbered 17 and 18, pp. 133, 134 of
the 4th volume of his ' Exercices de Mathematiqucs,' where the normal and

tangential tensions, referred to surfaces in the actual state of the medium,

are denoted by A, B, C, D, E, E. These expressions contain 21 arbitraiy

constants, of which six, <3, 33, C, 23, <£, ff, denote the tensions in the state of
equilibrium. If these be for the present omitted, the remaining terms will

be wholly small quantities of the first order, and therefore the tensions may

be supposed to be referred to a unit of surface in the actual, or in the

undisturbed state of the medium indifferently. On substituting now for

   Let us now form the part of the expression for <p involving the constants

which express the pressures in the state of equilibrium. It will be convenient

to effect the requisite transformation in the expressions for the tensions by two
steps, first referring them to surfaces of the actual extent, but in the original
position, and then to surfaces in the original state altogether.

ing to Cauchy's &, 93 . . . Jf. The sum of the right-haud members of equa-

--tions (33) and (38) gives the complete expression for 2<£ which belongs to

Cauchy's formulse. It contains, as we see, 21 arbitrary constants, and is a

particular case of the general form used by Green, which latter contains

27 arbitrary constants.
   I have been thus particular in deducing the form of Green's function which

belongs to Cauchy's expressions, partly because it has been erroneously asserted

that Green's function does not apply to a system of attracting and repelling

molecules, partly because, when once the function f is formed, the short and
elegant methods of Green may be applied to obtain the results of Cauchy's
theory, and a comparison of the different theories of Green and Cauchy is

greatly facilitated.

   [" The object of the Committee is to make pubhc such recorded facts through the
medium of the Association, and being accessible to the pubhc hi that manner, to bring
the greatest amount of science to the solution of the difficulties now existing to the scien-
tific improvement of the forms of vessels and the qualities of marine engines. They will
especially endeavour to guard against information so furnished to them being used in any
other way, and they~trust they may look for the cooperation of members of Yacht Clubs
having steam-yachts, of sliipowners, as well as of steamship-builders and engineers."

Third Beport, 1861, p. 16.]

--284 report 1862.

   Your Committee have the pleasure of stating that, at the unanimous
request of the members of the Committee, his Grace the Duke of Sutherland
undertook the office of Chairman. The Committee have, since February last,
held monthly meetings, and intermediate meetings of a sub-Committee.

   Your Committee have pleasure in reporting very satisfactory progress, and
that they have had an increasing amount of useful information placed at
their disposal. Much greater interest is now taken in the objects of the
inquiry, and a still increasing number of observers have adopted the forms of

the Committee, for recording the performances of vessels.

   The importance of the information collected by your Committee is attracting
the attention of steamship-owners, as veil as scientific investigators ; and it
is hoped the result of greater efficiency and economy in the application of

steam as well as improvements in the construction of steam- vessels, will be
the result of these Reports ; and your Committee have reason to believe that
considerable advantages have already been derived from their labours by

steamship-owners.

 --The Royal Navy. Your Committee, in their Third Annual Report, stated

the results of their communications with the Admiralty, and have now to

report that the objects of your Committee continue to meet with the approval

of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and of the intelligent scientific

officers in that  branch  of  Her  Majesty's  service                                that your Committee  have
                                                                                  ;

been furnished from time to time with accurate returns of the performances

of the more important steamships in Her Majesty's service which have been

tried at the measured mile during the last twelve months, and also some

similar returns, received too late for insertion in the Report of last year. In

the Appendix will be found a selection from these returns, preference having

been given to the returns of vessels of which the future steam performances

at sea have been promised.

   Your Committee have received several returns of performances of Her

Majesty's ships at sea, the publication of which, owing to their being incom-

plete in some important particidars, and to the lateness of the time at which

they were received, is necessarily postponed.
   Your Committee call attention to the selection they have made, which will

be found in the Appendix.

   As numerous inquiries have, from time to time, been made of your Com-
mittee as to the particulars of certain of Her Majesty's steamships, the per-

formances of which were noticed in previous Reports, your Committee, with

a view to avoid unnecessary correspondence, and to give the required infor-
mation more fully than can be done by written communications, determined

to include in the present Report three sets of tables of trials of H.M.'s ships,
which were officially tabulated by the Admiralty, but not issued by them to

the public.

   The reprinting of those tables, and the textual information accompanying
them, in the Appendix to the present Report will now supply those who
possess the previous Reports of your Committee with the means of comparing

the results obtained upon the trials of nearly the entire of the steamships of
war composing the British Navy, and will also enable them to compare with

the results of such trials the performances whilst at sea of very many of the

vessels included in the complete and extensive lists to be found in the three
Reports previously published, and in the present Report of your Committee,

without the necessity, which before existed, of searching elsewhere for the

information.

   The publication of the three Admiralty Tables will also render it un-
              ON STEAMSHIP PERFORMANCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                  285

necessary hereafter to repeat many particulars as to the dimensions, &c, of

the ships, and the power and other details of the engines of such of H.M.'s
ships of which your Committee may, from time to time, receive returns of
performances at sea.

   In the previous Reports, the records of special trials with propellers of
various kinds, in the steamships ' Plying Fish,' ' Bullfinch,' ' Doris,' &c,

were given ; and the Committee are now enahled to furnish another series
of experiments with Her Majesty's gunboat ' Stork,' which are very interest-

ing, and to which is added a short abstract of the trials of the · Shannon '
and ' Psyche.'

--AThe Steam Transport Service.  series of tables, prepared by Mr. G.

Murdoch, Superintending Engineer at Constantinople during the Crimean

War, and now Inspecting Engineer of Her Majesty's Steam Reserve at Ports-

mouth, having been carefully calculated for the purpose of showing the

respective values of the several steamships, classified according to the nature

of the employment or the special character of the duties required to be per-

formed, have been placed at the disposal of your Committee. These tables,

besides giving the expense of moving each ship 1000 miles, and the cost of

conveying sick and wounded officers and troops, cavalry, cattle, and cargo,

over the same distance, give the daily coal-consumption and the distance

run for each ton of coal consumed. They have also the additional value

arising from contrasting the different results obtained, and costs incurred,

when propelling the same vessels at different speeds.

--Royal Mail Service. Your Committee have been favoured with a copy of

the Engine Register kept by the West India Royal Mail Steam Packet Company,

showing the exact performances of some of their largest steamships. The

tabulated statement, which will be found appended to this Report, is for the

twelve months ending June last, and has reference only to the steamers em-

ployed on the West India Transatlantic route between Southampton and St.

Thomas.

To this Porm of Return your Committee would invite special attention,

as they are not aware that such is kept by any of the other large Steam

Packet Companies or steamship-owners ; and the great value of the informa-

tion it affords, as also the very complete form in which that information is

rendered, will, it is thought, be admitted by every one who is conversant

with such matters. The importance of such a record to a corporation like
the Royal Mail Company can hardly be over-estimated, when it is considered
that they have no less than nine distinct routes of steamers in the West
Indies and the Brazils, and that exactly the same system is adopted in regard

to all these ; so that the performance of every vessel engaged on these lines
is, on the completion of each succeeding voyage, thus carefully analysed and
brought under the immediate notice of the managers.

In addition to the above, indicator diagrams are taken from the engines

on every voyage, and sent home for inspection                                                                                                                                                                the  particulars  of these  are
                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

further entered in a register kept for that purpose. The Royal Mail Company

have kindly furnished your Committee with a copy of their register of the

diagrams taken on all the voyages comprised in the first-mentioned table,

thus affording a complete synopsis of the working both of their ships and

engines on the West India Transatlantic route, during the twelve months

referred to.

Your Committee have included also the dimensions and other particulars
--286 report 1862.

of the ' Mooltan,' a new vessel belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam

Navigation Company, with returns of a voyage from Southampton to Alex-
andria and back, showing the results of the performance of this vessel, as
compared with some other vessels in the same service. It is to be regretted
that the Peninsular and Oriental Company found they were unable to give a
continuance of the reports of the performances of the vessels composing their
fleet of ships this year in time for the publication of this Eeport. The Com-
mittee have reason to believe that next year full reports of the performances
of these vessels for this and next year will be forthcoming.

   The Pacific Koyal Mail Company have furnished your Committee with the
dimensions and abstract of the performances of their last additions to their
fleet (see Appendix). The particulars of the other vessels have been given

in previous Reports.

   It is worthy of remark that the vessels belonging to this Company fitted
with double-cylinder expansion engines, specially noticed by your Committee

in previous Reports as remarkable for their economy, have continued to per-
form in the same economical manner ; and, under the circumstances, it has
not been considered necessary to furnish a continuation of the logs previously

given.

   The City of Dublin Company's Returns for the past year are omitted
and your Committee regret that the log of the ' Munster,' and the results

--attained by working out her performances, although the calculations have
--involved considerable trouble to the Committee in their preparation, have

also to be omitted.

   Tour Committee have received from the Royal African Mail Company an
abstract of the log of the screw steamship ' McGregor Laird ' on her first
voyage from Liverpool to Madeira, and the particulars of the vessel and
her machinery. To the performances of this ship your Committee call
especial attention, on account of the great economy exhibited in the con-

sumption of fuel.

  --Foreign Mail Service. Your Committee would call attention to the returns

supplied of the performances of the steamships belonging to the Austrian

Lloyds' Steamship Company ; and although they are to some extent incom-
plete (which arises from no systematic recording having previously been
adopted), this, it is promised, will be remedied in future by the adoption of
the forms supplied by your Committee.

  --The Mercantile Marine Service. Your Committee have been occupied prin-

cipally in effecting arrangements by which a more thorough and extended
organization of the means of obtaining returns of the performances of mer-
cantile steamships employed in ocean navigation can be secured, and also in

making personal application to many of the largest steamship-owners at the
principal ports of Great Britain. They have succeeded in enlisting the active
cooperation of many proprietors of steamships. In some cases the owners
of mercantile marine ships, upon being called on by members of this Com-

mittee, at once requested their superintending engineers to adopt the " forms
of returns " prepared by this Committee, and in other cases the result of such
personal communication has been the suggestions of modifications in the
" forms ; " but, in all instances, or nearly so, the engineers have undertaken
that, in future, a more perfect and systematic recording of the performance
at sea shall be adopted, and that the results shall be regularly placed at the
disposal of your Committee.
ON STEAMSHIP PERFORMANCE.  287

    "With a view of obtaining, with greater facility than heretofore, returns of
performances, as well as the dimensions and particulars, of ships, engines, and

machinery, your Committee have adopted a form of pocket-book, or " En-
gineers' Pocket Log," which contains a greater number of details than were

included in their previous " forms of returns." This log is so arranged that

the returns can be removed from the case when filled up, and the blank form
inserted. Each book is furnished with a pocket to receive and preserve the

indicator diagrams or " cards."
    Although these books have only recently been issued, considerable numbers

of them are in course of being filled up by the engineers of ocean-going steam-
ships ; and arrangements have been made for the regular transmission of
these returns from each ship during the next twelve months. Since the
issuing of these Pocket Logs, your Committee have received particulars of
between 30 and 40 first-class ocean-going screw steamships, which were,
however, received too late to be properly tabulated so as to accompany the
present Eeport. These returns are being examined and arrauged for pub-
lication. The Engineers' Pocket Logs have been freely circulated and well
received, and they promise to yield a large amount of valuable information

to the Association.

  A list of the particulars asked for will be found in the Appendix.

   The particulars of the ' Great Eastern ' having been already published, the
logs of her performances on her Transatlantic voyages have been regularly
supplied to your Committee since she has been refitted and placed upon the
North American service.

   These logs have been collected, and are given in the Appendix to the

present Eeport.

 --Performances of Vessels under Sail. In compliance with the recommenda-

tion of the Council of the Association, your Committee have succeeded in
obtaining promises of copies of the logs or returns of the performances of several
of thelargestsailing-ships belonging to the Australian, India, and China Packet
Services, and to this end special observations are being made; and it is

hoped that the results of the labours of those who have undertaken the duty
of supplying your Committee with these returns may be included in the next
Eeport in such a form as will render them available for comparison with the

performances of full-powered and auxiliary steamships performing similar

voyages.

   Your Committee have received from the Earl of Durham the logs of the
sailing schooner-yacht ' Beatrix,' on her Mediterranean voyages. The dimen-

sions and particulars of this vessel, together with scale of displacement, have
also been received, but not in time to be included in the Eeport.

   Your Committee have been promised the particidars of some auxiliary-
powered ocean steamships.

   The Committee purpose to act upon a suggestion made to them, of forming

a list of the Engineers of the several classes employed in the mercantile steam

service, who have, with the sanction of the owners, supplied your Committee
with returns of the performances of ships under their charge, to which re-
ference may be had by such members of your Association as are interested

in the subject, and with a view to afford opportunities for the advancement
of such Engineers as have shown the greatest amount of scientific ability in
connexion with their calling.

   Your Committee have determined to act upon a suggestion by which the
--288 report 1862.

performances of some steamships, which, are at present withheld, may in

future be supplied for the use of the Committee, viz., that such returns shall

be published under a distinguishing number, instead of publishing the name of
the vessel, her builders, and the constructors of her machinery, and that the

latter particidars shall only be disclosed with the consent of the owners.
   Your Committee continue to receive from steamship-owners and engineers

invitations to be present at the trials of steamships.

   The sum of ,£150, voted by the Council of the Association to defray the

expenses of your Committee, has been expended and slightly exceeded.

Your Committee have thought it desirable to add the following particulars

of items to be included in a form of return to be printed, and circulated with

the logs and forms of returns issued by the Committee.

Position of centre of gravity of vessel.

Position of centre of buoyancy.

Position of metacentre for rolling.

Position of metacentre for pitching.

Wedges of immersion and emersion at an angle of 1\, or 15, or any other

number of degrees.

Approximate radius of gyration of vessel about longitudinal axis.

Approximate radius of gyration of vessel about transverse axis.

Number of rolling oscillations per minute.

Number of pitch oscillations in a minute.

  A lithographed sheet has been added to the Appendix, containing nine

indicator diagrams and a scale of displacements, as your Committee considered

those elements to be necessaiy for the proper consideration of the returns and

particulars furnished to them.

   The other indicator diagrams, which have been received by your Committee

too late to be embodied in the present Eeport, may be seen by any one inter-

ested therein on application at the Offices of the Committee.

   The thanks of the Association are due to Colonel Paradis, the Technical
Director of the Austrian Lloyds' Company, who, at the request of the Com-
mittee, caused the information in the Appendix relating to the vessels of
this Company to be compiled expressly for insertion in the present Report.

   The thanks of the Committee are also due to
   The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, the Secretary of the Admiralty,

       the Comptroller of the Navy, and the Engineer-in-Chief of the Admiralty,
       for such information as they have furnished, or permitted to be supplied
       to your Committee, relating to the trials and sea performances of vessels
       in Her Majesty's service.
   To the heads of the various Departments of the Service, and to the officers
       under them, for the facilities afforded to your Committee in obtaining
       such information as the rules of the Service allow, or which have been

--formance of Her Majesty's ships at sea, especially to the Eoyal Naval

Engineers, than whom a more thoroughly practical, highly intelligent,

--and valuable body of scientific officers does not exist in this or any other

country, for the assistance they have so readily afforded.

To the various Steamship Companies and Steamship Owners, and their

   Managers and Engineers, who have supplied returns.

   The Meetings of your Committee during the year have been held at Stafford

House, through the kindness of his Grace the Duke of Sutherland, and have

been fully attended.

 The     thanks  of  the  Association  are  again due to Mr.  "W.  Smith,  C.E., for

^

his valuable aid. His offices have also been freely at the service of the

Committee.

   In conclusion, your Committee believe that their labours have already been
productive of considerable advantage, that the objects with which they were
appointed are being rapidly attained, and that, by continuing their labours,
the machinery they have succeeded, after considerable trouble, in organizing
will be productive of the utmost benefit to those engaged in steam navigation,
and they have reason to believe that the future collection of the returns will
be a comparatively easy task.

 --Engines. The cylinders are 80 in. diameter; stroke, 42 in.
 --Surface Condenser Has brass tubes 1 in. external diameter, with

cooling surface of 6568 square feet.

 --Cold-water Pumps for supplying Condenser with Sea Water. Two double-

acting horizontal pumps, 21 in. diameter, and a stroke of 18 in., which can be

increased to 24 in. It being found that this capacity of pump supplied too much

water, eight holes, If diameter, were bored through each pump-piston. On

the second trial, there was still sufficient water, and the pumps worked much

easier and without any noise. The sea-water was forced through the brass

tubes in condenser, and the steam was condensed on the external surface of

ihe tubes.

 --Boilers. There are sixteen furnaces in the four main boilers, with a grate

surface of 350 square feet, and a total heating surface of 9400 square feet.

 --Auxiliary Boiler. There are two furnaces, with a grate surface of 25

square feet, and a heating surface of 460 square feet (not in use on trial-

trips).

--The Superheater has a heating surface of 2000 square feet.

Pressure. Safety-valveswere loaded to a pressure of 30 lbs. per square inch.

The Propeller is three-bladed, 17 ft. diameter, with an increasing pitch

Varying from 29 to 32 ft.

   tween the Cloch and Cumbrae lights, a measured distance of 13-66 knots,
   which she accomplished in 61 minutes 50 seconds, equal to a speed of 13-25

   knots per hour ; revolutions from 47 to 50 per minute, with a steam-pres-

   sure in boilers varying from 26 to 29 lbs. per square inch. Draught of water
   being 20^ ft.

    --Consumption of Coal, $c. On November 2nd the ' Hansa' was taken out

   again, and the steam kept at a pressure varying from 26 to 29 lbs. per

   square inch, the revolutions of the engines ranging from 48 to 50 per

   minute                          and it was found that 8616 lbs.  of coals, which were weighed
                                ;

   on deck and lowered to the stoke-hole, kept the steam up at the pressure

   above named for 136 minutes. This is equal to a consumption of 3801 lbs.

   of coal per hour, or about 2 lbs. per horse-power. The coals used were
   from the best Welsh pits (Aberdare).

      The Temperature of the Steam in the boilers was 272° ; on leaving super-
   heater, 340°; on entering cylinder, 280°. There being the facility for
   mixing the steam in this case, the steam from three boilers was supplied

   superheated · and the steam from the fourth passed direct to the cylinder.

   This was found to be necessary from the superheated steam being too dry for

   the packing and faces. The result of this will be seen from the diagrams in

   the Appendix.

    --Feed-water. The temperature of feed-water about 80°, and the water to

   make good the waste that occurred by blowing off steam, &c, was supplied

   to the large boilers direct from the sea.

294 report--1862.

gauge has been visited and tested by some person well acquainted with the
subject, and provided with the necessary apparatus. This examination,
involving as it does the testing of more than 500 instruments, scattered far
and wide over the British Isles, from Galway on the west to Norwich on
the east, from the Shetland Isles to Guernsey, cannot be completed for
several years, and is, moreover, not indispensable ; for adjacent stations will
generally enable us to determine if any large error attaches to either the
instrument or its position. For the present, then, it is a matter, not of
choice, but necessity to take the readings as recorded by the observers ; and
as the majority of the gauges already tested have borne the examination

satisfactorily, it is presumed that this may be safely done.

    In the next place, it is almost needless to say, that unless the height of
the rain-gauge above the ground and above sea-level be known, the records
are not comparable with other stations ; for every foot of elevation above the
ground is believed materially to diminish the amount collected, and every
increase in the height above the sea-level to increase it. These particulars

are therefore given wherever they are known ; but the values must be re-
ceived, subject to revision when the stations have been visited and the

elevations accurately determined.

    It is, of course, almost impossible to secure perfect accuracy in such an
extended series of returns as are combined in the following Tables, but I

believe they are very nearly perfect. The information was sent to me by the

observers in reply to circulars issued at the close of each year ; the returns,
as received from them, were classified into counties and districts, examined,
all errors being sent back for explanation, and copied into the following

Tables, which have finally been checked against the observers' MS. returns.
    The excessive rainfall in the Lake District of England having caused

considerable interest, not to say incredulity, it may be well to add a few

words in entire confirmation of the perfect veracity of the returns.
   The gauges were mostly erected in 1844 or 1845, by Dr. Miller of "White-

haven, whose known accuracy might alone be a sufficient guarantee ; but,

besides this, there is the personal experience of those who, like myself, have
studied the rainfall of that district, as alone it can be properly studied, dwelling
amid the mountains and watching the effect of each summit on the drifting
clouds, whether driven by a heavy gale or merely floating on a gentle breeze.

   To make certain that the gauges were as accurate as when originally

erected, I recently lent my friend Mr. G. H. Simmonds the necessary ap-

paratus ; he has carefully tested several of the gauges, and, so far as the

calculations are concluded, we find them strictly accurate.
   The stations have been arranged on the plan employed in the Eeports of

the Registrars-General of England and Scotland, except that the ordinary
county boundaries are maintained, and that the stations in each county are
arranged in the order of latitude from south to north. In Ireland, the
arrangement is merely according to latitude.

   The counties comprised in each district are enumerated in the following

List, so that the fall at any station may be referred to in the general Tables

with the greatest facility.

          --XX. Ireland. All the Counties whence returns have been

          received.

   The fall at a few of the stations has been laid down on the accompanying
Map, with the double object of illustrating the relative fall in different parts
of the British Isles, and the relation, in each locality, between the fall in 1860

--and 1861. This has been done in the following manner: Darkly shaded

discs uniformly represent the fall in 1861 ; lightly shaded, that in 1860.

The radii of the circles are half the scale given on the Map ; the diameters

therefore increase as the fall ; and hence the increased diameter of the circles
immediately points out the places of heaviest fall. The relative frequency
and extent to which either the darkly or lightly shaded circles extend beyond
the others shows which year had the heavier fall ; and the breadth of the

annulus shows by how much it exceeded the other.
   In selecting the stations for insertion in the Map, preference was given to

those less than 200 feet above mean sea-level, and at which the gauge was
within a few feet of the surface of the ground. It was not found consistent

with good geographical distribution to adhere rigidly to these requirements

in every case, but the exact height may be readily ascertained by reference to
the general Tables. The fact, however, that the mean height of the selected

gauges above the ground is, in England, 1 ft. 4 in. ; in Scotland, 1 ft. 11 in.
and in Ireland (omitting Cork), 7 ft. 7 in. ; and above the sea, 131, 177, and
108 ft. respectively, shows that a near approach has been made to the fulfil-
ment of these conditions. The paucity of stations in Ireland necessitated the

use of rather elevated gauges ; in the case of Cork, the Map shows the fall

at the ground computed from the fall observed 50 ft. above it, as otherwise
it would not have been comparable.

    It is remarkable, and perhaps suggestive, that in 1860 the excess in
South Britain was counterbalanced by a deficiency in Scotland ; and that in
296 REPORT 1862.

18G1 the equipoise was maintained, but in the reverse order, England being
comparatively dry, and Scotland (especially the western coast) subject to
almost unprecedented rains. It is also most noteworthy that, if the returns
from all the stations in England, Scotland, and Ireland are combined, the
fall is nearly identical in the two years. In 1860, the average fall at 390
stations was 39-784 inches ; and in 1861, 38-466 inches.

   The singularity of this result is fully shown by Table I., which gives the
average fall in each district for each year, and the excess or defect in each
district of 1861 over 1860.

                                               the two years.

fifteen years, it was found necessary to adopt, as a standard of comparison,
the fall during the ten years, 1850 to 1859.

   The fall during this period appears from Table II. to be very suitable for
the purpose, as the amount during it was generally within 5 per cent, of

the average fall during the last fifty years.

   Tables III. and IY. give the results obtained by comparing the fall in
1860 and 1861 with this standard, and show (1) that at almost cveiy
station the fall in the two years was greater than the average, (2) that the
excess was slight in Mid-England, larger in the South-west of England, the
South-west of Scotland, the West of Ireland, and largest of all in the
English Lake District.

             On Thermometric Observations in the Alps.
                  By J. Ball, M.R.I.A., F.L.S., $c.

At the Meeting of the British Association at Oxford in 1860, the writer

laid before the Section of Mathematics and Physics a plan for the systematic

observation of temperature in the chain of the Alps, and other mountain

countries, in which several members of the Alpine Club had been induced to

join.

Thermometers of uniform construction had been prepared for the purpose

by one of our best makers, Mr. Casella, and forms were printed with the ob-

ject of securing as far as possible a uniform and complete record of such

observations as should be procured.

The conditions under which these observations were to be made, and the

fact that most of the observers were not professed men of science, made it

indispensable to limit the plan so as to include only such objects as might be

accomplished without much expenditure of time and labour, and by means

of very light and portable instruments.

Four objects were suggested for inquiry :

1st. The determination of the minimum temperature on or near to the

higher peaks of the Alps, and other mountains, by means of self-registering

instruments fixed in suitable positions.

2nd. To obtain comparative observations of the effects of the radiant heat

of the sun upon black-bulb thermometers.

3rd. To trace the propagation of disturbances of temperature throughout a

mountain district by the multiplication of observations at a number of differ-

ent points.

4th. Observations on the temperature of the surface, and the upper layers

of the soil, at great elevations.

Unexpected circumstances have prevented the writer from visiting the

Alps during the last two years, and have very much restricted his opportu-
nities for carrying out his own share of the work ; and however moderate the
expectations were which he had formed, the difficulties in the way of obtain-

ing definite results have proved to be even greater than he anticipated ; so
that the plan has proved to be in some respects a complete failure, while in

others a limited degree of success has attended it.

1. In regard to the observations obtained by placing minimum thermo-

meters at great heights, the principal share of merit in whatever has been

accomplished is due to Mr. F. F. Tuckett, of Bristol, who is well known as a
very active and successful mountaineer, and a careful observer. He has
placed a considerable number of instruments at heights ranging from 7000
to 14,000 feet, and has collected and arranged the observations made by
various travellers upon the instruments so deposited by himself or by others.

   The following is a summary of the work done, and the results obtained,
with which the writer has been favoured by Mr. Tuckett :

   " Having been requested by the Committee of the Alpine Club to under-

take the registration of such data as might result from the exposure of regis-

tering-thermometers on the loftiest summits of the Alps, I am able to supply

the following brief account of what has been effected.

" The conditions of success were (1) the cooperation of as large a number

as possible of our mountaineers                                                                                              (2) correctness and uniformity in the instru-
                                                                                                                          ;

ments  employed                                 (3) a judicious exposure                                                     which  should secure  them  alike
                                             ;

from the influence of radiation and the protective effect of heavy falls of

snow, especially in winter ; and (4) some mode of firm attachment whieh

                                                                2b2

would prevent their either being carried away bodily, or the index from being
disturbed by unavoidable wind or still more provoking curiosity. As to the
first point, I have gratefully to acknowledge the assistance of a large number
of our best mountaineers, who have either deposited instruments themselves,
or sent reports of the readings of those already placed. Thanks to their
united efforts, about thirty minimiim thermometers have been exposed at
altitudes of from 7150 to 15,784 feet over a wide tract of country, extending
from the summits of the Yiso, Grand Pelvoux, to the Marraolata in the South-

ern Tyrol.

    " (2) The correctness of the instruments was, as far as possible, secured by
entrusting their constmction to Mr. L. P. Casella, one of our best makers, and
their uniformity by the adoption of a definite pattern. At first, in the
absence of a good mercurial minimum capable of acting in a horizontal position,
and in the uncertainty as to the sufficiency of the range of mercury, the
ordinary spirit- or Eutherford's thermometer was adopted ; but experience has
in the great majority of cases demonstrated its inefficiency, and in consequence
all the instruments deposited during the past summer and autumn, four in
number, have been mercm'ial, of Casella's last patent construction.

    " (3) The question of exposure has not been solved as satisfactorily as
could be desired, and this failure has I fear destroyed much of the value of
the results obtained. In the first place, the process of attaching a thermo-
meter to a bare rock at great elevations, often in a keen frost and chilling

wind, is by no means so easy as the enthusiastic meteorologist may suppose
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and without discussing here the various precautions which ought to be, and
perhaps might be, adopted in some exceptional cases, I would venture to
express an opinion that a well-constructed cairn of sufficient elevation, so
placed as to prevent its being buried by winter snows, is the simplest and
most efficient means of protecting the thermometer from the most serious
causes of disturbance. When, at least, this plan has been adopted, the
readings of the instruments have appeared trustworthy, and in almost all

other cases sadly the reverse. By this means also they are more screened
from inquisitive observation, and may better escape the pilfering propensities
of an inferior order of guides, whom we probably have to thank for the dis-

appearance of one at least fixed very securely by the writer on the Aiguille
du Goute.

  A" large proportion of the Eutherford minimums have become perfectly

useless from the division of the column, and it is this fact, coupled with a belief
that the lowest temperature of winter on the loftiest summits rarely exceeds

--40° Cent, (the freezing-point of mercury), which has led to their abandon-
ment and the substitution of the mercurial construction. From some receut

experiments, consisting in the alternate exposure of spirit-minimums to vary-

ing temperatures, I am disposed to attribute the separation of the column to

this cause, which, if due precautions are not observed in placing the instru-
ment, must be especially energetic at great altitudes.

    " Unless the thermometer can be protected from the influence of radiation
at night, or the respectively cooling and wanning effects of a thin or thick
layer of snow, variations from the true temperature of the air, amounting (as

shown by M. Martins) to 10° or 12° Cent. (18° to 22°Fahr.), may be pro-

duced, and the reading utterly vitiated for purposes of comparison. Besides,
if imperfectly shielded from radiation, it will probably be more or less sub-
jected to the direct action of the solar rays, and thus be exposed to tempera-

tures varying within twenty-four hours by as much as 55° C. (100° Fahr.).

My experiments show that a much more limited range than this suffices to

produce a ' solution of continuity ' in the column of spirit, which has
acquired amongst our mountaineers the expressive name of the ' bubble com-

plaint.'

   " In one instance an observer, whose accuracy I have no reason to doubt,

informs me that he could detect no trace whatever of spirit, nor any indication

of fracture in the glass by which it could have escaped. The index lay
' high and dry ' at the bottom of the bulb. This extraordinary result he
attributes to ' a sort of volatilization of the contained spirit;' and though it
seems difficult to understand how it could have taken place to the extent

mentioned, there is little doubt that vaporization of the contained spirit to

an extraordinary extent will occur, as pointed out by Dr. Hooker some years

ago in the Appendix to his 'Himalayan Journal.' If my informant's state-
ment appear exaggerated, I hope the probable truth which underlies it may

draw attention to the question.
   " The causes just alluded to, and the comparatively short time which has

elapsed since these observations were commenced, must be accepted as some

justification of the meagreness of the results.

   " The readings of the minimum temperature of the autumn and summer

months at elevations of 9000 to 15,000 feet (Table III.) appear rarely to fall

--below 10° Cent., or if they do, the condition of the thermometer is generally

stated by observers to be suspicious. The lowest winter reading registered is

-- 41° C, in the case of a thermometer placed on the Col d'Argentiere at a

height of upwards of 12,000 feet; but as when observed the spirit had separated,

we have no right to assume that it had not done so before the index

Weattained its actual position.  have, however, four observations which

seem entitled to entire confidence as far as the instrument is concerned,

though one at least certainly does not represent the lowest temperature of

the air. The minimum on the Becca di Nona, near Aosta, carefully deposited

in a cairn at a height of 10,382 feet, has been found in perfect working

Myorder after the lapse of two years.  excellent friend M. Carrel informs me

that the minimum temperature of the winter of 1860-61 and 1861-62

-- -- --was respectively 27° and 23° C. (-- 17° and 10° Fahr.). Again,

a similar instrument on the Col d'Erin, at a height of 11,408 feet, was

found in perfect preservation by Mr. "Whately last autumn after exposure

--during one winter, that of 1860-61. Its minimum reading was 21° C.
--( 6°Fahr.); but as earlier in the season I was unable to find it, though

it had been deposited by myself in 1860, there is no doubt that it must have

been buried in the snow during either the spring or winter, and thus its indi-

cations are probably considerably too low, since for the same period the tem-

--perature on the Becca di Nona (1000 feet lower) fell to 27°. Lastly, a

thermometer placed last year in a cairn on Scaw-Pell Pike appeared to be in

-- +good order this spring, and registered 10° C. ( 14° Fahr.) as the greatest

winter cold.

" To the above observations it may not be amiss to add one by M. Lizat on

the Pic de Nethou, the highest point of the Pyrenees (11,168 English feet).

--This instrument, placed at the summit, registered 24°-2 C. in the winter

of 1857. If we compare the preceding observations with the registers kept

at Geneva and the Great St. Bernard, we have during the winter 1859-60

-- --at Geneva the minimum readings of 23° on 21st Dec. 1859, and 11°-1

on 16th February^ 1860. Corresponding to these, the lowest temperatures

--recorded at the Great St. Bernard were 27Q, 2 on 16th December 1859,

--and 25°-3 on 10th March 1860. Even allowing that we are not certain

that the instruments at levels higher than the Great St. Bernard were clear

winter than at other seasons." F. F. Tuckett.

   2. The objections to attempting a measure of the radiant heat of the sun
by exposing black-bulb thermometers, are obvious and well known ; never-
theless it was thought that by using instruments as nearly as possible
identical in construction, exposed in the same manner, and rejecting all
observations in which the result could be affected by wind, results compar-
able inter se might be obtained. It is believed that if the first condition
could be secured this inference would be found correct, but in point of fact it
is a matter of extreme difficulty to obtain the requisite identity of construe-

tic-n. Among the instruments provided for the purpose by Mr. Casella, the

writer has found that a slight difference in the size of the bulb has a very
marked difference in the indications of the instrument, amounting in some

cases to 2°-5 C.

   It was also found that the interval of three minutes allowed for the ex-
posure of the black-bulb thermometer to the sun was too great. At con-
siderable heights the air does not often remain perfectly calm, nor the sky
completely clear of passing films of cloud, for mauy minutes together. It ia
necessary to allow an interval long enough to make an error of, say, one
second in the moment of reading the instrument not very sensible in the
observation ; but one minute is certainly preferable to three ; and after esperi-
 370 report--1862.

 ence had disclosed the mistake, the writer always recorded three readings,
 corresponding to one, two, and three minutes of exposure.

    The season of 1860 was unusually inclement, and the sky rarely in favour-
 able condition, so that in the course of about eight weeks the writer obtained
 but thirty- nine observations, of which the large majority were taken under
 unfavourable circumstances, and must therefore be rejected.

    In 1861 fifteen observations were made in the "Western Pyrenees under
 more favourable conditions.

    In addition to the above, several observations made in 1860 by the Rev.
 T. G. Bonney, Mr. R. B. Hayward, Rev. E. J. A. Hort, Mr. A. T. Malkin, and
 the Rev. Leslie Stephen have been communicated by those gentlemen to the
writer. Excluding those fairly open to suspicion, the results are registered in

the annexed Table (I.). An accurate comparison of these results would involve

as one element the altitude of the sun at the moment of each observation,
but the sources of error are too many and considerable to make this worth

the requisite trouble. All that can fairly be inferred from the Table is that
the sun's rays produce a greater effect on the black-bulb thermometer at
higher than at lower levels, the difference, though quite perceptible, being not
considerable in amount. It is true that the highest reading out of twenty-

four observations by the writer recorded in the Table was at Eaux Bonnes,
only 2458 feet above the sea ; but without considering the probability that
that reading was exaggerated by the radiation of heated bodies (walls, &c.)
near the thermometer, it will be observed that it was made at 20 min. before

noon on July 25, and does not therefore indicate as great an effect of solar
radiation as the observations made on the Schleeren (8399 ft.) at 1.10 p.m.
on August 25, or on the Breche de Roland (9200 ft.) at one hour and a quarter
before noon on August 16.

   3. As might, perhaps, have been anticipated, the attempt to trace the
propagation of disturbances in temperature by means of a network of obser-
vations covering a considerable tract of mountain country residted in complete
failure. Even if the observers had been more numerous and more diligent
than they were, the disturbing effects of local causes are far more serious
than was apprehended. The effects of vicinity of the soil in raising the
indications of the thermometer by day and lowering them by night, are not
yet as fully measured or appreciated as they ought to be, and it is question-
able whether the observations made at fixed observatories are as nearly com-

parable as they are commonly supposed to be. Among other authorities on

this point, a recent nienioir by Mr. Charles Martins might be referred to as

showing how important is the effect of slight differences of level on the

nocturnal indications of the thermometer.

   The welcome intelligence that the Swiss men of science are about to esta-

blish fixed stations for systematic observations of the thermometer and other

meteorological instruments throughout the territory of the Confederation
makes the disappointment on this head less important, as it is probable that,
with requisite skill and caution in observing and reducing the results, the

plan now believed to be definitively adopted will much enlarge our knowledge

of Alpine meteorology.

   4. Observations on the temperature of the soil at and near to the surface
in mountain countries are of considerable interest from their bearing on the

distribution of animals and plants. It is not too much to say that if such
observations had been available, M. Alphonse DeCandolle would have been
led to modify several of the conclusions stated in his standard work on
         DREDGING ON THE NORTH AND EAST COASTS OF SCOTLAND. 371

Geographical Botany, respecting the conditions of life to which high alpine

plants are subjected.

   Regarded only as an object of physical inquiry, it is clear that the only
observations which can be considered in any degree comparable are those
made in dry soil, and this condition is so seldom fulfilled, that comparatively
few observations have been obtained. Some made by the writer, and several
others communicated by Mr. A. T. Malkin, but apparently not made in quite
dry soil, agree in showing that in the higher regions of the Alps, approaching
to and above what is commonly called the limit of perpetual snow, the
plants and animals that dwell on the surface of the soil must, during the

short period of their active vitality, receive an amount of heat much larger
than has commonly been supposed. The annexed Table (II.), although too
limited to furnish general results, may be worth preserving as evidence upon

this point.

Report of the Committee for Dredging on the North and East Coasts of

                Scotland. By J. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.R.S.

The Marine Invertebrata enumerated in the following list were found by
Mr. Robert Dawson on that part of the coast of Aberdeenshire which extends
from the mouth of the Ythan to the mouth of the Fgie. The distance in a
straight line is about 15 miles. The whole of this coast, with the exception

of the sands of Forvie and the little bays of Peterhead and Cruden, consists
of precipitous granite and gneiss rocks.

   The sea-bed appears to slope gently and regularly from the shore for 10
or 12 miles, the only exception to this uniformity being a ravine (or Hole as
it is called by the fishermen) opposite to Slains Castle. This ravine com-
mences about half a mile from the shore, and stretches out at right angles to
the land, the depth varying from 25 fathoms to 35 fathoms.

   The Laminarian zone, which, except about Peterhead, is very narrow,
is succeeded by a belt of pure white sand, extending in breadth to the
30 -fathom hue from 3 to 4 miles from the shore. This sand has in general
been very unproductive, but in the ravine just mentioned many of the rarest
species have been got.

   Dredging may be said to have begun at 30 fathoms, and extended over the
Coralline zone till it attains a depth of 90 fathoms. On one occasion the dredge
was used in 60 fathoms, at a distance of 15 or 16 miles from shore. Two of

the species enumerated in the list were brought up by a fisherman's line 30
miles from land (viz. Trophon scalariformis and Pinna pectinata).

   The following abstract shows the number of Molhisca identified :

Gasteropoda Prosobrancbiata   110
         Opisthobranchiata      11
         Nudibrancliiata         8

Pteropoda                          1
Conchifera Lamellibranebiata
                               92
        Bracbiopoda
                                  1

                              223

   Of this number the following are Arctic and probably fossil, viz. Trophon

scalariformis, T. Gunneri, Astyris Holbollii, Scalaria EschricM, Natica clausa
and helicoides, Margarita cinerea, STceneal costulata, Adeorbis subcarinata,
Lepeta cceca, Astarte arctica and elliptica, TeUina proxima, Scrobicularia
372 report--1862.

piperata, Mya truncata, Saxicava rugosa, and Hypotliyris psittacea, besides the

Pecten islandicus, which is not unfrequently dredged.
    Some of these fossil shells have been found in almost eveiy haul of the

dredge, as Astarte elliptica, Tellina proximo,, Pecten islandicus, and Saxicava

rugosa.

    All the others, with the exception of Scrobiadaria piperata, have been
found in three different spots, viz. the Hole, before mentioned, opposite the
mouth of the Ythan, 6 miles from land, in 40 fathoms, and opposite tbe

--mouth of the Ugie, 6 miles from land, in 35 fathoms, that is, exactly at each

extremity, and in the middle of the space which has been dredged over by
Mr. Dawson.

    But although the fossil species found appear to be principally confined to
the three spots indicated, yet the presence of some of them wherever the
dredge has been used tends to prove that a tertiary bed extends along the
whole coast and to a great distance seaward, some of these fossils having
been brought up 30 miles from land by the fishermen's lines. Of the 17
apparently fossil species enumerated, 10 have been found in a decidedly
fossil state in the drift clay in different parts of the county *. These are

Trophon scalariformis   at Belhelvie, near the sea.

Natica clausa           at King Edward, several miles from sea,
          helicoides    at King Edward, ditto.

Astarte arctica         various places.
           elliptica
                        ditto.
Tellina proxima
Scrobicularia piperata  ditto.

Mya truncata            raised beach at Ythan Month.
                        King Edward.
Saxicava rugosa
Pecten islandicus       Belhelvie, &c.

                        ditto.

Of species usually accounted rare, the following arc rather common in this

district, viz.:

                 Lepton nitidum.        Aclis ascaris.
                          convexum.               supranitida.

                 Lima subauriculata.    Eulimella Scilla;.

                 Skenea divisa.                    acicula.

                            costulata.

   There are a few species enumerated by Dr. Gordon in his ' List of the Mol-
lusca of the Moray Tirth' which do not appear to have been found by Mr.
Dawson ; the late Prof. Macgillivray also, in his ' Mollusca of Aberdeenshire,'
records some which Mr. Dawson has not met with.

                                        Note on Bolocera eqttes.

   Dredged off Peterhead in 35 fathoms on June 20, 1862, and still alive.

 --Base. As described by Mr. Gosse in his ' Actinologia Britannica.'
 --Column. Upper half covered with longitudinal rows of close-set warts, in

ordinary circumstances not minute, but very variable in size at the pleasure

--of the animal.
   Dish. As described in ' Act. Brit.'
  --Tentacles.- Arranged as described in ' Act. Brit.,' but several of them hav-
ing double points, and thus causing their number to appear to be 150 or up-
wards. They are extremely variable in shape, being sometimes contracted
to a mere thread, and at other times distended till they are almost globular.

   * Mr. Jamieson of Ellon supplied Mr. Dawson with this list of fossils. He has speci-
mens of many other Arctic shells from the same beds, but these are either still alive in the

district, or have not been found with the dredge.

The apex appears to be more truncate than that described and figured by
Mr. Gosse.

 --Mouth. As described in < Act. Brit.'

                                                                  Colour.

  --Column. Straw-colour ; striae nearly white ; warts, when fully expanded,

white, with a pellucid spot in the centre.

 --Disk. General colour similar to that of the column, radiated with white

stria?, with conspicuous radiating deep-red bands arising from a point within
each inner tentacle, and passing in pairs round the tentacles, exactly as in

Tealia crassicomis.

 --Tentacles. Pellucid white ; a broad magenta ring near the apex, gradually

shading into pellucid white above the middle, and succeeded by an opake
white band.

                                                                            Size.

    Height of column, 2 inches.

   Length of tentacles, when fully expanded, 5 inches.

   This specimen is still (Sept. 17, 1862) in full health and beauty; it has
lost, however, a little of the brilliancy of the magenta or purplish colour on

the tentacles. On some occasions it has slightly shifted its base on the stone

to which it adheres, and after a few days moved back to its former site.

    In presenting this Report, Mr. Jeffreys observed that its most peculiar and

interesting feature was the discovery of so many Arctic species of shells in a
fossil state, mixed with recent shells of other species. He accounted for this
assemblage of fossil and recent shells in the same spot by supposing that

towards the close of the glacial epoch the sea-bed containing these arctic
shells was gradually upheaved and became dry land, so as to exterminate the
breed, and that subsequently the bed was submerged and inhabited by other
species, which had either migrated from the south, or were diffused in course

of time over the present area of the German Ocean. Such a state of things
would imply very long periods of elevation and subsidence.

Report of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. W. Vernon Harcourt,

    Right Hon. Joseph Napier, Mr. Tite, M.P., Professor Christison,
   Mr. J. Heywood, Mr. J. F. Bateman, Mr. T. Webster, on Tech-
   nical and Scientific Evidence in Courts of Law.

"Writers on legal evidence have frequently animadverted on the testimony of
professional witnesses in a Court of Justice as being contradictory and un-
reliable, in a degree which materially diminishes its value ; nor is it denied
among the candid members of more than one profession that greater con-
trarieties of opinion on technical and scientific subjects appear in the ivitness
box than can be satisfactorily accounted for, or than would be likely to arise
anywhere else.

   The effect of such contradictions is not only to leave doubts on many

important issues which art and science might well have decided, but to lower
the authority and credit of all that class of evidence to such a point, that it
has even been proposed very recently to dispense with it altogether in some
cases which seem most to require the light that it might afford.

   The principal cause which has thus shaken the credit of professional
374 report--1862.

testimony is to be found, not in those differences of judgment which we
might reasonably expect when we view it as a species of evidence embracing

inferences as well as facts, but rather in the anomalous practice of engaging
technical and scientific witnesses ex parte, to prove a case on either side.

   In vindication of such a practice, it may be said that there is no otber

method by which the truth can be so well elicited, and justice therefore so
well administered. As the arguments of counsel ex parte for their respective
clients bring out before the judge and jury all that can be alleged on either

side in point of reasoning, so may the facts adduced in the same manner by

professional witnesses be considered as giving a more complete view of the
data for determining a question than if they were sought by an indifferent

inquirer.

    This statement might be accepted as satisfactory, if professional witnesses
were engaged to investigate facts only ; but they are engaged also to deliver
opinions ; and opinion, even in conscientious minds, is prone to follow the side
which it is employed to support ; whilst less scrupulous witnesses are induced
by the position in which they are placed to utter opinions different from those

which they have been known to deliver on the same points under other

circumstances.

   The evil of such a state of things is undeniably great, not only as regards
the credit of honourable professions, but the public administration of the law
for questions of importance are thus tried under the double disadvantage of
testimony which can be only partially trusted, and juries who are incompetent
to sift it, because relating to subjects with which they are little acquainted.
Nor are these questions of rare occurrence; technical evidence has of late
been greatly extended, in proportion to the rapid progress of the arts ; and it
must be remembered that it comprehends trades as well as professions,
including all cases in which experts are called in to speak to facts or infer-
ences of which persons inexperienced in the trade or profession are incapable
of judging. So numerous and important have these cases become, that the
evidence which affects them cannot but be considered as having gained such
a place in our jurisprudence as to demand a careful revision of its very serious

defects.

    For some years past, various schemes of alteration in the existing practice
of the courts have been suggested. In a lecture delivered by Dr. Christison
before the Edinburgh College of Physicians in 1851, and in papers read by
Dr. Angus Smith in 1857 and subsequent years before various societies, the
whole subject has been ably discussed ; the attention of several legal and
judicial authorities has also been drawn to it by Mr. Hareourt ; and the
Committee consider themselves as having gained sufficient information to
perform the duty entrusted to them by the Association of " suggesting im-
provements in the present practice respecting scientific evidence as taken in
Courts of Law."

   Any attempt to supersede the existing system, as respects the liberty of
each party in a suit to obtain evidence for its own case on technical questions,

whether of fact or opinion, the Committee would regard as impracticable.
But they are of opinion that such checks on ex parte evidence might be intro-
duced with advantage as would counteract some of its injurious tendencies,
and would lead, in a conflict of opinions, to a better judgment on the merits

of the case.

    In days less scientific than the present there were questions of great im-
portance in a maritime country, the just decision of which required more
technical knowledge than any ordinary jury could be supposed to possess.
         TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN COURTS OP LAW. 375

It has long been allowed therefore to transfer cases which would have been
blindly determined by persons possessing no nautical skill, from the ordinary
tribunals to a judge assisted by a certain number of Masters of the Trinity

House, before whom the evidence is given.

   The result of all the inquiries which the Committee have been enabled to
make is, that there will be found no method of correcting the present practice

in the trial of intricate scientific questions, so little open to exception as one
that should be founded on the principle thus already adopted in questions of

navigation.

    There is reason to believe that opinions in evidence stated before a Court
capable of appreciating them would be given with a greater measure of care

and a more prudent reserve, and that a judge assisted by assessors who

(being themselves experts) fully understood the technical value of the evi-
dence, would deliver a judgment more founded in reason and accordant with
justice than can ever be obtained from the present tribunals.

   The Committee would therefore propose that, by a legislative act, judges
should be empowered, on application from a suitor, in causes of a technical

character, to convene skilled assessors, the number of whom should not

exceed three, and who should give their opinions truly on the statements of
the witnesses, in such manner as they shall be required by the judge, pre-

vious to his adjudication of the cause.

   A Court constituted as is here proposed might see a necessity in some

cases for independent evidence of the facts on which either party relied. The

allowing the judge to call in witnesses independent of the parties in such
cases, as is done on various occasions by Courts of Chancery and by Parlia-
mentary Committees, is a measure which has been suggested by a high
judicial authority, and would, in the opinion of the Committee, be a valuable
supplement to the preceding provision.

    In recommending these changes, the Committee have had in view the

evidence given in civil causes : in criminal cases the opinions of witnesses are

 ar less affected by partisan feelings. There may be a few instances, however,

in which it might serve the interests of public justice that the judge should
have power to direct an issue to be tried by a Court constituted on the
principles here proposed. But the defect of the scientific evidence in criminal
causes chiefly consists in want of competence on the part of the witnesses :
questions, for instance, of secret poisoning sometimes hang on the judgment
of a practitioner or analyst of insufficient experience. The remedy for this
deficiency is indeed understood to be virtually in the hands of the magis-
tracy, since the Government authorities never refuse to select proper persons
for the investigation of cases in which the Crown is concerned; but the
Committee are of opinion that it would be an important improvement on the
present practice, if the magistrates were advised that application should be
made by them for the appointment of such competent persons by the Crown
in every case requiring accurate scientific investigation.

    If the recommendations contained in this Report should be approved by
the Association, the Committee would advise that they should be laid before

the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with an application for his

concurrence in carrying them into effect, and that the Parliamentary Com-
mittee of the Association should be requested to support the application, and
to promote any Bill in Parliament which may be founded on the foregoing

principles.

An Account of Meteorological and Physical Observations in Eight

    Balloon Ascents, made, under the Auspices of the Committee of the
    British Association for the Advancement of Science at Manchester

    by James G-laisher, F.R.S., at the request of the Committee, con-
    sisting of Colonel Sykes, Professor Airy, Lord Wrottesley, Sir D.
    Brewster, Sir J. Herschel, Dr. Lloyd, Admiral FitzRoy, Dr. Lee,
    Dr. Robinson, Mr. Gassiot, Mr. Glaisher, Dr. Tyndall, Mr. Fair~
    bairn, and Dr. W. A. Miller.

The objects to which the Committee resolved to devote their principal atten-

tion were the determination of the temperature and hygrometric condition
of the air at different elevations above the earth's surface. In addition to
·which, several other secondary objects were to be carried out if possible, as

 follows :

                                 § 1. Objects of the Expekiments.

    The primary objects were
    The determination of the temperature of the air, and its hygrometrical

states, at different elevations, as high as possible.

    The secondary objects were
    To determine the temperature of the dew-point by Daniell's dew-point
hygrometer, by Regnault's condensing hygrometer, and by dry- and wet-bulb
thermometers as ordinarily used, as well as when under the influence of the
aspirator ; so that considerable volumes of air were made to pass over both
their bulbs, at different elevations, as high as possible, but particularly up

to those heights where man may be resident, or where troops may be

located, as in the high lands and plains in India, with the view of ascer-

taining what confidence may be placed in the use of the dry- and wet-bulb

thermometers at those elevations, by comparison with the results as found
from them, and with those found directly by Daniell's and Kegnault's hygro-
meters, and to compare the results as found from the two hygrometers

together.

    To compare the readings of an aneroid barometer with those of a mercurial
barometer up to 5 miles.

   To determine the electrical state of the air.
   To determine the oxygenic condition of the atmosphere by means of ozone

papers.

   To determine the time of vibration of a magnet on the earth, and at
different distances from it.

   To collect air at different elevations.
   To note the height and kind of clouds, their density and thickness.
   To determine the rate and direction of different currents in the atmosphere,

if possible.

   To make observations on sound.
   To note atmospherical phenomena in general, and to make general obser-

vations.

                                    Instruments and Apparatus.

   The instruments used were mercurial and aneroid barometers ; dry- and
wet-bulb thermometers; Daniell's dew-point hygrometer; Eegnault's con-

densing hygrometer ; maximum and minimum thermometers ; a magnet for

horizontal vibration ; hermetically sealed glass tubes from which air had

been exhausted ; ozone papers ; and an electrometer lent by Prof. W. Thomson

--of Glasgow.
   Barometers. The mercurial barometer employed in all the ascents was

a Gay-Lussac's siphon barometer by Mr. P. Adie, and is one of those

used by Mr. Welsh in the year 1852 in his experiments. The inner

diameter of its tube is 0-25 inch. The graduations were made on a brass

scale, from its middle point upwards and downwards ; each division was about

0-05 inch in length, representing twice that value, so that an observation

of either the lower or upper surface of the mercury would give the approxi-

mate length of the column of mercury.

The readings of the upper end were alone taken, and the corrections appli-

cable to this end have been applied to all observations.

   The barometer was furnished with its own thermometer, whose bulb was

immersed in a tube of mercury of the same diameter as that of the barometer.

This instrument sometimes read more than 20° in excess of that of the

sensitive air-thermometer.

   The aneroid barometers were made by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra ; one

--was graduated to 13 inches, and the other to 5 inches the latter instrument

having been used in the ascents on August 18 and September 5, and the

former on July 17. In consequence of a difference of reading between the

aneroid and mercurial barometers on July 17 (and as both instruments were

broken, it was impossible to say which was in error), and as the correctness

of the siphon barometer at low readings is dependent upon the evenness of

the tube, another barometer was used in addition on September 5, made by

and at the suggestion of Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, as follows :

  A tube 6 feet in length was filled Avith mercury and boiled throughout

its whole length ; a glass cistern was blown on the bottom of the tube, and

bent upwards in the form of a siphon ; a stopcock was placed between the

tube and cistern, and whilst the mercury filled the entire tube, a mark was

made on the cistern, at the level of the mercury in it, for zero ; the stop-

cock was then gradually opened, and the mercury allowed to descend one or

more inches. The rise which consequently took place in the cistern was
carefully marked on the same side as " " (zero) ; the stopcock was again

opened and the same operation was repeated until 30 inches of mercury had

left the upper part of the tube, and the successive levels of the mercury in the

cistern had been accurately marked.

In finally making the barometer, the upper portion only of the tube was

used; the cistern which had been at the end of the lower portion was

removed and joined on the upper; and in graduating the scale of the

barometer, the rise which took place in the cistern at every inch was

deducted, and the scale reduced in its entire length, by the exact amount

of the rise of the mercury in the cistern. This instrument was therefore

--probably as accurate at low readings as at high.
   Dry- and Wet-Bulb Thermometers. Two pairs of dry- and wet-bulb

thermometers were employed ; one pair as ordinarily used, their bulbs being

protected from the direct rays of the sun by a double highly polished silver

Ashade, in the form of a frustum of a cone, open at top and bottom.

cistern was fixed near to them, from which water was conveyed to the wet-

bulb thermometer.

The bulbs of the second pair of dry- and wet-bulb thermometers were

enclosed in two silver tubes placed side by side, and connected together by

a cross tube joining their upper ends, and over both were placed double

shades as in the other pair of thermometers. In the left-hand tuhe was
placed the dry-bulb, and in the right-hand tube the wet-bulb thermometer.
Towards the lower end of the left-hand tube there was an opening ; by means
of the aspirator a current of air was drawn in at this aperture, then passed
the dry-bulb in its upward passage into the small horizontal tube, and from
thence into the right-hand tube, passing downwards over the wet-bulb, and
away by a flexible tube into the aspirator. These instruments were made

--by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra.
   Regmndt's Condensing Hygrometer. This instrument was made with two
thermometers, as described by Eegnault in the ' Annuaire Meteorologique de
la Prance' for 1849, page 221, excepting that it was furnished with silver-gilt
cups. The scale was of ivory, and the two thermometers were fixed in their
cups by means of cork, for ready packing up. The instrument was made by
Messrs. Negretti and Zambra.

    Daniell's Hygrometer was of the usual construction, by Messrs. Negretti and
Zambra.

  --Exhausted Tubes for collecting Air. These tubes were partly constructed

by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, and partly by Mr. Casella.
    The thermometers employed in the observations were exceedingly sensitive

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the bulbs were long and cylindrical, being about ftbfl of an inch in length,
and ^-th of an inch in diameter. The graduations, extended to minus 40°,
were all on ivoiy scales. These thermometers, on being removed from a room
heated 20° above that of an adjoining apartment, acquired the temperature
within half a degree in about 10 or 12 seconds ; but in passing from a heated
apartment to one of a lower temperature, it took more than double the time
to approximate to within half a degree of the latter. They were so sensitive
that scarcely any correction is required to be applied to them on account of
sluggishness ; and this was found to be the case by the veiy near agreement
in the temperatures at the same height in the ascending and descending
curves, in those cases where there was reason to believe that there had been
no change of temperature at the same height, within the interval between
the two series of observations.

                                    § 2. Observing Arrangements.

    One end of the car was occupied by Mr. Coxwell ; near the other, in front
of myself, was placed a board or table, the extremities of which rested on the
sides of the car ; upon this board were placed suitable framework to carry the

several thermometers, hygrometers, magnet, aneroid barometer, <kc. ; a per-
foration through it admitted the lower branch of the mercurial barometer to
 descend below, leaving the upper branch at a convenient height for observing.

A watch was set to Greenwich time, and placed directly opposite to myself.

The central space of the table was occupied by my note-book. The aspirator

was fixed underneath the centre of the board, so as to be conveniently work-

able by either my feet or hands. Holes were cut in the board to admit the

 passage of the flexible tubes, one of which passed to Eegnault's hygrometer,
 and the other to the place of the dry- and wet-bidb thermometers previously
 referred to, both the tubes being furnished with stopcocks.

                 Circumstances of the Ascents, and General Observations.

  --The ascents were all made by Mr. CoxwelTs large balloon, three from

 "Wolverhampton, four from the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, and one from

Mill Hill, near Hendon, where the balloon had fallen the evening previous,

and had been anchored during the night.

 --Ascent from Wolverhampton, July 17. The balloon was inflated at the

Stafford Road Gas-works, Wolverhampton, with carburetted gas, most care-

fully prepared by the Engineer, Mr. Thomas Proud, and frequently kept a

long time for our use, the Directors of the Gas Company having most liberally,

to their great inconvenience, placed a gasometer at our disposal for as long

a time as we needed it. To the Directors of the Company and to Mr. Proud

our best thanks are due ; for on all occasions they showed the utmost anxiety
to contribute to the success of the experiments, in which Mr. Joseph Walker,

Mr. Joseph Cooper, and Mr. Proud took great interest.

The weather previously had been bad for a long time, and the ascent had

been delayed some days in consequence ; the wind was still blowing strongly

from the West ; and considerable difficulty was experienced in the preliminary

arrangements, and no instrument was placed in its position before starting.

AThe ascent took place at 9h 43m a.m. ; at once the balloon was quiescent.

height of 3800 feet was reached before an observation could be taken ; at 4000

feet clouds were entered, which were left at 8000 feet. The temperature of

the air fell to 33°, and a height exceeding 10,000 feet had been passed before

all the instruments were in working order. Tbe sky was then noticed to be

of a deep-blue colour, without a cloud of any kind upon its surface.

   At starting, the temperature of the air was 59°, and dew-point 55° ; at
4000 feet it was 45°, dew-point 33°, and descended to 26° at 10,000 feet, dew-

point 19°, and then there was no variation of temperature between this height

and 13,000 feet. During the time of passing through this space, both Mr.

Coxwell and myself put on additional clothing, feeling certain that we should

experience a temperature below zero before we reached 5 miles high ; but to

my surprise, at the height of 15,500 feet, the temperature, as shown by all

the sensitive instruments, was 31°, dew-point 25° ; and at each successive

reading, up to 19,500 feet, the temperature increased, and was here 42°,

Wedew-point 24°.  had both thrown off all extra clothing. Within two

minutes after this time, when we had fallen somewhat, the temperature

again began to decrease, with extraordinary rapidity, and was 16°, or 27°

less than it was 26 minutes before : at this time a height of 5 miles had been

reached, at about 11 a.m.

  When the balloon had attained a height of 4 miles, I wished to descend
for one or two miles and then to re-ascend ; but Mr. Coxwell, who had been

watching its progress with reference to the clouds below, felt certain that

we were too near the Wash prudence therefore caused us to abandon the
                                                                                                                               ;

attempt.

Our descent began a little after 11 a.m., Mr. Coxwell experiencing con-

siderable uneasiness at our too close vicinity to the Wash ; we came down

quickly, passing from a height of 16,300 feet to one of 12,400 feet between

Hll h 38m and h 39m ; dipping into a dense cloud at this elevation, which

proved to be no less than 8000 feet in thickness, and whilst passing

through this the balloon was invisible from the car. Mr. Coxwell had re-

served a large amount of ballast, which he discharged as quickly as possible

to check the rapidity of the descent ; but notwithstanding all his exertions, as

we collected weight by the condensation of that immense amount of vapour

through which we were passing, the descent was necessarily very rapid, and we

came to the earth with a very considerable shock, which broke nearly all the

instruments. All the sand was discharged when we were at a considerable

elevation ; the amount we had at our disposal at the height of 5 miles was

                                                                     2c2

fully 500 lbs. ; this seemed to be more than ample, and, when compared with
that retained by Gay-Lussac, \iz. 33 lbs., and by Hush and Green, when the
barometer reading was 11 inches, viz. 70 lbs., seemed indeed to be more than

we could possibly need, yet it proved to be insufficient.
   The descent took place at Langham, near Oakham in Rutlandshire, in a

meadow near the residence of Mr. E. G. Baker, from whom we received the

utmost attention.                                                          table was fixed to the

side of the car, partly within and partly without. The instruments were

placed on a framework, fixed to the part of the table outside, so as to be

beyond the influence of the occupants of the car ; my note-book, watch, and

aneroid barometer rested on the inner part of the table. The air was in

gentle motion from the south-west, enabling the instruments to be made
ready for observation before starting, and at 4h 40m p.m. the balloon left the

earth.

   The temperature declined instantly. Observations were taken every minute

or half-minute from the time of ascent, to as near as possible the time of

descent.

   The readings of one barometer were kindly made by Mr. "W. F. Ingelow,
and he also assisted me in observing the first appearance of dew on the

hygrometer.

  A height of 7000 feet was reached at about 6 o'clock, and the descent began

about a quarter past ; it was rather rapid, but quite under control, and we

--reached the earth at the vfllage of Singlewell, near Gravesend, at 6h 30m .
   Ascent from Wolverhampton, August 18. The weather on this day was

favourable ; there was but little -wind, and that blowing from the W.E. By noon

the balloon was nearly inflated, and as it merely swayed in a light wind, all the
instruments were fixed before starting, and at lh 2m 38 s p.m. Mr. Coxwell

pulled the spring-catch ; for a moment the balloon remained motionless, and

then rose steadily almost perpendicularly : this ascent was all that could be

desired. In about 10 minutes we passed through a fine cumulus cloud, and

then emerged into a clear space with a beautiful blue sky dotted over with

cirrus clouds above. "When at the height of nearly 12,000 feet, with the
temperature of 38°, or 30° less than on the ground, and dew-point 26°,

Mr. Coxwell discharged gas, and we descended to a little above 3000 feet at
l h 48m ; a veiy gradual ascent then took place till 2h 30 m, when a height of

about 24,000 feet was obtained ; and here a consxdtation took place as to the
prudence of discharging more ballast or retaining it, so as to ensure a safe

descent ; ultimately it was determined not to go higher, as some clouds, whose
thickness we could not tell, had to be passed through. The descent began
soon after, and we reached the earth a little after 3 o'clock at Solihull, about

--7 miles from Birmingham.
   Ascent from the Crystal Palace, August 20. The air was almost calm, the

instruments were all fixed before starting, and the balloon left the Crystal

Palace  at  61               26TM  p.m.,  the  temperature  at  the  time  being  66°,  dew-point  54°.
                          '

By 6h 35m we were half a mile high, the temperature being 56°. At 6h 37m

the height of three-quarters, of a mile was attained, and the air was so tran-

quil that we were still over the Palace. At 6h 43m, when at the height of

nearly a mile, a thick mist or thin cloud was entered, the earth being just

visible. The temperature at this time was 50°, dew-point 46° ; this elevation

and temperature were maintained for about five minutes, and we then descended

200 or 300 feet. Xennington Oval was in sight. At 7" 9m St. Mark's

WeChurch, Kennington, was exactly underneath us.                                  were now about a

London was heard, and there was scarcely a breath of air stirring.

  A descent was gradually made to 1200 feet by 7h 20m ; the lamps were being

lighted over London, the hum of London greatly increasing in depth. At this

time shouting was heard of people below who saw the balloon ; a height of be-
tween 1500 and 2500 feet was maintained till 7h 40m, the temperature varying

from 57° to 54° and dew-point about 47°. The river appeared dull, but the

bridges that spanned it, as well as street after street as lighted up, and the

miles of lights, sometimes in straight lines, sometimes winding like a serpent,

or in some places forming a constellation at some place of amusement,

constituted a truly remarkable scene, associated as this appearance was with

the deep sound, or rather roar of the traffic of the metropolis.

For a considerable time Kennington Oval and Milbank Penitentiary were

in sight, and it seemed as though we could not get away from them. At

7U 40 m Mr. Coxwell determined to ascend above the clouds. "We were then

about 2500 feet high, and the temperature was 53°, dew-point 46°. At
7h 42m a height of 3500 feet was attained, the temperature being 51°. At 7h 47m
a height of one mile had been reached, and the temperature was 45°, dew-

point 42°. It was very dark below, but there was a clear sky above,

Weand a beautifid gleam of light appeared.  still ascended till the clouds

were below us, tinged and coloured with a rich red : the temperature had

now fallen to 43° ; we were soon enveloped in a fog again. At 7h 52 m the

striking of a clock and the tolling of a bell were heard. It was quite dark

below, but the sun tinged the tops of the clouds. At 8h 5m we were quite
above the clouds, and it became light again ; the hum of London gradually

died away. By this time the temperature had increased to 55°, the barometer
reading 23 inches, corresponding to a height of 7400 feet. After this we

descended, and it became too dark to read the instruments. London again

was seen, very different indeed in its appearance from when we could pick out

every square, street, bridge, &c. by its lights ; now, as seen through the mist,

it had the appearance of a large conflagration of enormous extent, and the

sky was lit up for miles around. After a time the lowing of cattle was heard,

and we seemed to have left London, so Mr. Coxwell determined to pass through

the clouds and examine the country beneath. We passed from the compara-

tive light above to the darkness beneath, momentarily becoming darker, and

found ourselves some little distance froni London, and shortly afterwards

touched the ground, so gently that we were scarcely aware of the contact, in

the centre of a field at Mill Hill, about one mile and a half from Hendon, and

it was resolved to anchor the balloon for the night, with the view of making

an early morning ascent.

  --Ascent from Mill Hill near Hendon, August 21. By half-past 4 a.m. the

instruments were replaced, and the earth was again left. It was a dull,

warm, cloudy morning, still rather dusk, the sky overcast with cirrostratus

cloud. The temperature was nearly as high as 61°, and dew-point 59°.

There were in the car, besides Mr. Coxwell and myself, Captain Percival, of

the Connaught Rangers, Mr. Ingelow, and my son.
  We at first rose very slowly; at 4h 38m we were 1000 feet high, and

the temperature was 58°, dew-point 56°. At 4h 41m there was a break

in the clouds to the east, and a beautiful line of light with gold and
silver tints. Here and there, the morning mist was sweeping. At 4h 51 m

the temperature was 50°, and dew-point 42° ; scud was below us, and the

cloud of night was in a transition state into cumulus, or the cloud of day, at

the same level as we were, viz. about 3500 feet ; black clouds were^ above,

and mist was creeping along the ground. At 4h 55m we were above a mile

high ;  the  temperature     was   43°,  dew-point  42°                   we  were just  entering                   cloud.
                                                                       ;

At 4h 57m we were in cloud, surrounded by white mist ; the temperatures of

the air and the dew-point were alike, viz. 39|°. The light rapidly increased,

and gradually we emerged from the dense cloud into a basin surrounded by
immense black mountains of cloud rising far above us ; shortly afterwards we

were looking into deep ravines of grand proportion, bounded with beautiful
curved lines. The sky immediately overhead was blue, dotted with cirrus

clouds.

   As we ascended, the tops of the mountain-like clouds became silvery and
golden. At 5h lm we were level with them, and the sun appeared, flooding

with golden light all the space we coidd see for many degrees both right and

left, tinting with orange and silver all the remaining space around us. It
was a glorious sight. At oh 10m a height of 8000 feet had been attained,

and the temperature had increased from 38|° in the cloud to 41°. AVe still

ascended, rather more quickly as the sun's rays fell upon the balloon, each

instant opening to us ravines of wonderful extent, and presenting to our view
a mighty sea of clouds. Here arose shining masses of cloud in mountain

chains, some rising perpendicularly from the plain, dark on one side, and

silvery and bright on the other, with summits of dazzling whiteness ; some
were of a pyramidal form, and a large portion undulatory or wavy, in
some places subsiding into hollows, and in one place having the appearance
of a huge lake ; on the extremity of the horizon snowy peaks bounded the
view, resembling Alpine ranges. Nor was the scene wanting in light and

shade : each large mass of cloud cast a shadow, and this circumstance, added

to the very many tints, formed a beautiful scene. At 5h 16m we were nearly two

miles high, the temperature was 32°, and dew-point 13° ; the air was there-

fore dry. At 5h 18m we were above two miles in height ; the temperature
was 31°, and dew-point 10°. By 5U 31m we were something less than three miles

--high ; the temperature was 23°, and dew-point 15°, and it decreased to 19° by

5h 34m . This elevation was maintained for half an hour, during which time

the temperature increased 5° or 6° as the sun's altitude increased. Shortly

after 6 o'clock it was determined to descend; the temperature, which
had been as high as 27°, had fallen to 23°. At 6h 13m, at the height of
2| miles, we heard a train. At 6h 20m we were two miles high, and the

temperature had       increased    to 39°, and dew-point                      to  19°                      at this  time
                                                                                                        :

I noticed the loud ticking of a watch ; Captain Percival said he could not

hear it ; he was seated, and I was standing ; and some experiments were

made, when it was found that when the ear was at the same level as the

watch, no sound was heard, but it was remarkably distinct on the ear being

situated above it.

At the height of two miles the barking of a dog was heard ; the tempera-

ture  at  this  time      h  24m)  was  43°,  and  dew-point              10° lower.                       The shadow of

the balloon, with an encircling oval of prismatic colours, was here very

remarkable, and it increased in dimensions and vividness of colour till we

entered a cloud at 6h 29m ; the increase of temperature, which had been in

progress during the descent, was immediately checked, and on emerging from
the cloud at 6h 33m the temperature was 43°, dew-point 38°. The earth was

now in sight, without a ray of sunlight falling upon it. The temperature

gradually increased to 56°, and dew-point to 50° at 1000 feet in height, and

62° on reaching the ground, as gently as on the preceding evening, at Dunton

Lodge near Biggleswade, on the estate of Lord Brownlow, where we received

every attention and assistance from his agent, Mr. Paulger.
ON EIGHT BALLOON ASCENTS IN 1862.                       383

 --Ascent from the Crystal Palace, September 1. The wind on this day blew

from the E.N.E., the sky was almost covered with cirrostratus cloud, but
the horizon was moderately clear. The ascent took place at 4h 40m p.m. ; the

temperature was 64° ; the balloon rose to the height of half a mile in 4 minutes,
the temperature decreasing to 51°, and dew-point to 43° ; at this time the whole
of the River Thames, from its mouth to beyond Richmond, was in sight. At

5h 31 m, when we were about 4000 feet high, clouds were observed forming

and following the whole course of the Thames, from the Nore up to the

higher parts, and extending but little beyond its sides ; the clouds were
parallel to the river, following all its windings and bendings. The Astro-

nomer Royal has often seen this phenomenon over the part of the river

commanded by the Royal Observatory, but it was scarcely expected that

clouds throughout its whole course would have formed so simultaneously and

uniformly. On referring to the state of the tide, it was found to be just high

water at London Bridge about this time, connecting the formation with the

warm water from the sea. After 5h 40TM we were higher than all clouds near

us, excepting the uniform stratus cloud above us, which we never approached

and it was noted that the upper surface of the lower clouds was bluish white,

the middle portion the pure white of the cumulus, and the lowest a blackish

white, and from which rain was falling, and, as we afterwards learned, had

Wobeen falling all the afternoon.  descended to 1300 feet nearly, but were

still above the clouds; we then rose to 3000 feet, and rain fell upon the

balloon from the upper stratum of cloud, and no difference of temperature

from 54° was observed in the stratum between 1300 feet and 3000 feet,

although a short time before, in passing downwards through this distance,
the temperature had increased from 48° to 54°. The falling rain equalized
the temperature. The balloon began to descend after this, and fell at 6h 15m
near "Woking in Surrey. The evening looked so unpromising, and rain was
still falling, that it was thought unadvisablo to fasten the balloon for the
night, and attempt a high morning ascent, as was contemplated. In this
ascent the observations of the barometers and Daniell's hygrometer were

made by Mr. J. MacDonald, Assistant Secretary to the British Meteorological

Society.

 --Ascent from Wolverhampton, September 5. This ascent had been delayed,

owing to the unfavourable state of the weather. It commenced at l h 3ra p.m. ;

the temperature of the air was 59°, and the dew-point 50° ; at the height of one

mile it was 41°, dew-point 38° ; and shortly afterwards we entered a cloud of

about 1100 feet in thickness, in which the temperature of the air fell to 36§°,

the dew-point being the same, thus indicating that the air was here saturated

with moisture. On emerging from the cloud at lh 17m, we came upon a flood

of strong sunlight, with a beautiful blue sky, without a cloud above us, and

a magnificent sea of cloud below, its surface being varied with endless hills,

hillocks, mountain chains, and many snow-white masses rising from it. I

here tried to take a view with the camera, but we were rising with too great

rapidity, and going round and round too quickly to enable me to do so ; the

flood of light, however, was so great, that all I should have needed would

have been a momentary exposure, as Dr. Hill Norris had kindly furnished me

--when cooled down to 30° ; hut a dew-point obtained from the readings

--of dry and wet gave 36°. Up to this time I had taken observations with

comfort. I had experienced no difficulty in breathing, whilst Mr. Coxwell,

in consequence of the necessary exertions he had to make, had breathed with
difficulty for some time. At l h 51 m the barometer reading was 11-05 inches,

but which requires a subtractive correction of 0-25 inch, as found by com-

parison with Lord Wrottesley's standard barometer just before starting. I
--afterwards read the dry thermometer as
                                                                       5°            this  must  have  been    about

lh 52m or later; I could not see the column of mercury in the wet-bulb

thermometer ; nor afterwards the hands of the watch, nor the fine divisions

on any instrument. I asked Mr. Coxwell to help me to read the instruments,

as I experienced a difficulty in seeing. In consequence, however, of the

rotatory motion of the balloon, which had continued without ceasing since

the earth had been left, the valve-line had become twisted, and he had to

leave the car and mount into the ring above to adjust it. At this time I

looked at the barometer, and found it to be 10 inches, still decreasing fast;

its true reading therefore was 9| inches, implying a height of 29,000 feet.

myShortly afterwards I laid       arm upon the table, possessed of its full rigour,
--and on being desirous of using it, I found it powerless it must have lost its

power momentarily. I tried to move the other arm, and found it powerless

also. I then tried to shake myself, and succeeded in shaking my body. I

seemed to have no limbs. I then looked at the barometer, and whilst

doing so my head fell on my left shoulder. I struggled and shook my

body again, but could not move my arms. I got my head upright, but

myfor an instant only, when it fell on                           right shoulder, and then I fell

backwards, my back resting against the side of the car, and my head on

its edge ; in this position my eyes were directed towards Mr. Coxwell in

the ring. When I shook my body I seemed to have full power over the

muscles of the back, and considerable power over those of the neck, but none

over either my arms or my legs ; in fact I seemed to have none. As in the
case of the arms, all muscular power was lost in an instant from my back and

neck. I dimly saw Mr. Coxwell in the ring, and endeavoured to speak, but

coidd not ; when in an instant intense black darkness came, the optic nerve

finally lost power suddenly. I was still conscious, with a.s active a brain as at

the present moment whilst writing this. I thought I had been seized with

asphyxia, and that I should experience no more, as death would come, unless

we speedily descended : other thoughts were actively entering my mind,

when I suddenly became unconscious as on going to sleep. I cannot tell any-

thing of the sense of hearing ; the perfect stillness and silence of the regions

6 miles from the earth (and at this time we were between 6 and 7 miles high)

is such that no sound reaches the ear.

    My last observation was made at lh 54TM at 29,000 feet. I suppose two

or three minutes fully were occupied between my eyes becoming insensible

to  seeing  fine  divisions  and  lh  54m                   and  then  that          two   or  three  minutes  more
                                                         ,

passed till I was insensible, therefore I think this took place at about l h 56m

or lh 57 m . Whilst powerless I heard the -words " Temperature " and " Ob-

servation," and I knew Mr. Coxwell was in the car speaking to me, and

endeavouring to aroiise me, therefore consciousness and hearing had returred.

I then heard him speak more emphatically, but I could not see, speak, or

--move. I heard him again say, " Do try now do." Then I saw the

instruments dimly, then Mr. Coxwell, and very shortly saw clearly. I rose

in my seat and looked round, as though waking from sleep, though not refreshed
                 ON EIGHT BALLOON ASCENTS IN 1862.                 385

by sleep, and said to Mr. Coxwell, " I have been insensible ; " be said,

You have'.*.  ;  and I, too, very nearly."  I then drew up my legs, which had

been extended before me, and took a pencil in my hand to begin observations.

Mr. Coxwell told me that he had lost the vise of bis hands, 'which were black,

and I poured brandy over them.

  --I resumed my observations at 2h 7m, recording the barometer reading at

11-53 inches and temperature 2°. I suppose that three or four minutes

were occupied from the time of my hearing the words " temperature " and

" observation " till I began to observe ; if so, then returning consciousness
came at 2'1 4m , and this gives seven minutes for total insensibility. I found

the water in the vessel supplying the wet-bulb thermometer, which I had by

frequent disturbances kept from freezing, was one solid mass of ice ; and it

did not all melt until after we had been on the ground some time.

   Mr. Coxwell told me that whilst in the ring he felt it piercingly cold ; that
hoar-frost was all round the neck of the balloon ; on attempting to leave

the ring, he found his hands frozen, and he had to place his arms on the ring

and drop down ; that he thought for a moment I had laid back to rest myself

that he spoke to me without eliciting a reply ; that he then noticed my legs
projected and my arms hung down by my side; that my countenance was

serene and placid, without the earnestness and anxiety he had noticed before

going into the ring, and then it struck him I was insensible. He wished

to approach me, but could not, and he felt insensibility coming over him-

self : that he became anxious to open the valve, but in consequence of having

lost the use of his hands he coidd not, and ultimately did so by seizing the

cord with his teeth and dipping his head two or three times until the balloon

took a decided turn downwards. This act is quite characteristic of Mr. Cox-

well. I have never yet seen him without a ready means of meeting every

mydifficulty as it has arisen, with a cool self-possession that has always left

mind perfectly easy, and given me every confidence in his judgment in the

management of so large a balloon.

No inconvenience followed this insensibility, and when we dropped it was

in a country where no conveyance of any kind could be obtained, so that I

had to walk between seven and eight mdes.

The descent was at first veryrapid; we passed downwards three miles in nine

minutes ; the balloon's career was then checked, and finally descended in the

centre of a large grass field belonging to Mr. Kersall, at Cold "Weston, seven

and a half miles from Ludlow.

   1 have already said that my last observation was made at a height of

29,000 feet; at this time (l h 54m ) we were ascending at the rate of 1000 feet

per minute, and when I resumed observations we were descending at the rate

of 2000 feet per minute ; these two positions must be connected, taking into

account the interval of time between, viz. 13 minutes, and on these con-

siderations the balloon must have attained the altitude of 36,000 or 37,000

--feet. Again, a very delicate minimum thermometer read 12°, and this

would give a height of 37,000 feet ; Mr. Coxwell on coming from the ring

noticed that the centre of the aneroid barometer, its blue hand, and a rope

attached to the car, were all in the same straight line, and this gave a reading

of 7 inches, and leads to the same result. Therefore these independent means

all lead to about the same elevation, viz. fully 7 miles.

   In this ascent six pigeons were taken up. One was thrown out at the
height of three miles, when it extended its wings and dropped as a piece of

paper ; a second, at four miles, flew vigorously round and round, apparently

taking a dip each time ; a third was thrown out between four and five miles,

Aand it fell downwards as a stone.                                                     fourth was thrown out at four miles on

descending ; it flew in a circle, and shortly alighted on the top of the balloon.

The two remaining pigeons were brought down to the ground. One was found

to be dead                                                and the other, a " carrier," was still living, but would not leave
                                                       ;

the hand when I attempted to throw it off, till after a quarter of an hour it

began to peck a piece of ribbon which encircled its neck, and was then jerked

off the finger, and flew with some vigour towards Wolverhampton. One of

the pigeons returned to Wolverhampton on Sunday the 7th, and is the only

one that has been heard of.

 --Ascent from the Crystal Palace, September 8. The sky was for the most

part obscured by clouds ; the ascent took place at 4h 47m 28 s p.m., the tempe-

rature on the ground being 67° ; at 4h 52m we were half a mile high, with a
temperature of 59°, and dew-point 54° ; at 4h 55m we reached the clouds, with

a temperature of 51 1°, dew-point 49°, at the height of 4300 feet ; we rose to

4800 feet, were still in the cloud, and then fell, passing out of the cloud
downwards at 5h l m, with a temperature of 49°, and dew-point 46° ; we de-

scended to 3300 feet by 5h 7m, where the temperature was 52°, dew-point

50°                we then ascended and again reached the cloud at a little oven 4200 feet,
                ;

and with the same temperature as before, viz. 51 1°; we passed out of the

cloud at a little over 4500 feet, into a basin, with blue sky above, and the

sun shone beautifully ; the balloon rose quickly, and the temperature in-

creased from 51° on leaving the cloud to 57° at a mile in height, and to 59°

and dew-point 40° at 5400 feet ; we then descended, met with the cloud
again at 5h 25m, at the height of 5000 feet nearly, and experienced a tempe-

rature of 51°, dew-point 45°, whilst passing through it ; we left the cloud at

4400 feet high, and the temperature rose from 51° to 61°, dew-point to 59°,

at the height of 800 feet, and to 62° at the height of 700 feet, where we were
at 5h 55m ; at this time we were crossing the River Thames near to Graves-

end, and we                                               passed from   bank  to bank  in 121 seeonds                                                                           we  then rose to nearly
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

half a mile, and passed Tilbury Fort at the distance of 2 miles, and with a tele-

scope 1 examined the fort, and could have drawn its plan and counted any

Weguns within it.                                            fell at about 4 miles from the Fort, at 6h 10m r.M.

In this ascent Mr. W. C. Nash, of the Magnetical and Meteorological De-

partment of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, took the observations of the

barometer and Daniell's hygrometer.

                                                          § 3. Description of the Table of Observations.

All the meteorological observations taken during the ascents are contained

in Table I.

   Column 1 contains the times at which the observations were made.
Column 2 contains observations of the siphon barometer corrected for tempe-

rature and index error. Column 3 contains the readings of the thermometer

attached to the barometer. Column 4 contains the readings of an aneroid
barometer. Column 5 contains the height above the level of the sea, as de-
duced from the barometric observations in column 2, by the formula of Baily,

checked at intervals by that of Laplace, which is as follows ;

position of the balloon has been derived from the readings in column 10.
Columns 6 to 9 contain the observations with the dry- and wet-bulb ther-
mometers free, and the deduced dew-point. Column 10 contains the readings
of Negretti and Zambra's gridiron thermometer. Columns 11 to 14 contain
the observations with the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers aspirated, and the
deduced dew-point. Columns 15 and 16 contain the direct dew-point obser-

vations with Daniell's and Regnault's hygrometers. When numbers are

entered in columns 15 and 1G with " no dew " affixed to them, it is meant

that the temperature of the hygrometer has been lowered to the degree stated,

but that no dew has been deposited.
   Many observers in different parts of the country made observations at short

intervals for several hours together, on several days of which notice had been
given them that the ascent would take place, but, in consequence of the fre-
quent delays owing to bad weather, their observations were not available,
and it was found impossible to give notice with any certainty of the days of

ascents.

  A good many observers did, however, take a few observations in different

parts of the country on the days of the several ascents. The Astronomer
Eoyal at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, had observations taken every 10
minutes on all the days of ascent, and Lord Wrottesley always arranged to
have observations made at Wrottesley by Mr. Hough, on those days when the
ascent took place from Wolverhampton. In calculating the height of the
balloon, the observations of Wrottesley have been employed for July 17,
August 18, and September 5 ; and those of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
have been used for July 30, August 20, August 21, Sept. 1, and Sept. 8.

   The height of Greenwich above the mean sea-level=159 feet.
   The height of Wrottesley above the mean sea-level=531 feet.

  § 4. Adopted Temperatures of the Air and Dew-point, with Height, in
                                      the eight balloon ascents.

   From all the observations of the temperature of the air and of the dew-
point in the preceding Tables, a determination was made of both elements
with the corresponding readings of the barometer and heights. Some of the
numbers in the column for heights have been interpolated when either of

these elements have been observed without a corresponding observation of

the barometer. The numbers thus found are within brackets. The results

are contained in the following Tables.

--Table II. Showing the adopted Reading of the Barometer, calculated Height

       above the Sea, Temperature of the Air, and Temperature of the Dew-

        point in eight Balloon Ascents.
          ON EIGHT BALLOON ASCENTS IN 1862.  435

   At llh 7m the readings of the Dry and Wet (free) were 19°-0 and 9°-0,

--giving a dew-point temperature of 67°-4 ; and the readings of the Dry and

--Wet(aspirated)werel8°-2andl2°-0,giving a dew-point temperature of 34°-5.

   At llh 25m the readings of the Dry and Wet (free) were 28°-l and 17°-5,

--giving a dew-point temperature of 26°-l.

   From the general agreement of the results observed by Daniell's Hygrometer

--to 10°, by Regnault's Hygrometer to this and lower temperatures, and those

of the dew-point as found by the Dry- and Wet-bulb thermometers, there can

be no doubt that the temperature of the dew-point at heights exceeding 25,000

--feet must have been at least as low as 50°.

   These results differ considerably from those found in a cloudy sky, and
doubtless the difference between experiments carried on under a cloudless
sky at these elevations would differ still more. They do not at all confirm

rature is distributed : for this purpose all the observations of the temperature of

the air taken within this distance of the earth were laid down upon large dia-
grams ; a curved line was made to pass through or near them, and the reading
at every 100 feet was taken from these curves, and those at every even hundred
were inserted in the following Tables, as well as those from the projected
curves as found by joining the observations themselves, and in this way the
following Tables were formed :

   The next Table has been formed by taking the difference between the
temperatures at every consecutive 100 feet, in every ascent and descent, unF to
5000 feet.

462 .                  --report 1862.

   An inspection of this Table shows that the largest numbers are those

situated at the bottom, and the smallest at the top of each column in all states
of the sky, and therefore that the decline of temperature in equal spaces was
largest in that space next the earth, and gradually less with increase of ele-

vation.

   The numbers in the last column of the Table show the average value at
each 100 feet, the one in cloudy states of the sky, and the other in partially
clear states, with the number of experiments upon which each result is based.

            From these results the Decline of Temperature

            For the first 300 feet was      0°-5 for every 100 feet.

Therefore in cloudy states of the sky the temperature of the air decreases

nearly uniformly with the height above the surface of the earth nearly up to

the cloud.

In the first  100 feet there was a decline of 0°-9

   The decline of temperature near the earth with a partially clear sky is
nearly double of that with a cloudy sky ; at elevations above 4000 feet, the
changes for 100 feet seem to be the same in both states of the sky.

   In some cases, as on July 30, the decline of temperature in the first 100
feet was as large as 1°1.

   From these results we may conclude that in a cloudy state of the sky the

decline of temperature is nearly uniform up to the clouds ; that with a clear
sky the greatest change is near the earth, being a decline of 1° in less than
100 feet, gradually decreasing, as in the general law indicated in the preceding
Section, till it requires a space of 300 feet at the height of 5000 feet for a
change of 1° of temperature. These results lead to the same conclusion as
before, viz. that the theory of gradation of 1° of temperature for every
300 feet of elevation must be abandoned. As regards the law indicated by
all these experiments, it is far more natural and consistent, than that a uni-
form rate of decrease could be received as a physical law up even to moderate

elevations.

§ 6. Variation of the Htgrometric condition of the Air with Elevation.

   All the adopted readings of the temperature of the dew-point in Section 4
were laid down on diagrams of a large scale, and their points were joined ; and
as it was evident that there were strata of moist air, and that the changes do
not follow any regular decrease as in the case of the temperature of the air,
it was therefore not considered prudent to adopt any curve with the view of
obtaining normal results, but to use the projected curve as simply found by
joining the points as stated above. From the readings at every 1000 feet of
ON EIGHT BALLOON ASCENTS IN 1862.  463

elevation the next Table was formed ; other readings were taken at angular
intermediate points, and these are included in the remarks following the
Table. The numbers under the heading of "Tension of Vapour" are formed
by using " Regnault's Tables," and the degree of humidity in the next column
has been calculated by using the observed temperature of the air correspond-

ing to the observed temperature of the dew-point.

variation, but during which time there was a great increase of temperature,
and consequently the relative humidity decreased with rapidity from 95 to 39.
The balloon then fell from 19,500 feet to 19,200 feet, the temperature of the
air decreased to 38°, and the dew-point increased from 19|° to 21°, and the
humidity increased to 49. After 19,200 feet the dew-point decreased with
rapidity to 16° at 20,000 feet, with a humidity of 48 ; and afterwards with

great rapidity to a dew-point of less than --12° at 21,000 feet; and at

heights exceeding this the dew-point is unknown, but was certainly lower

-- --than 20°, and probably as low as 30° up to 24,000 feet ; from the ob-

servations of the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers it seems to have been as

low as --50° at 25,000 feet; therefore the tension of vapour above 20,000 feet

must have varied from about 0-015 in. to less than - 01 in., and the degree
of humidity to have decreased to 2, or even less. In this series we can
distinctly trace a stratum of moist air in the cloud above 4000 feet, and
again between the heights of 9500 feet and 11,500 feet. From 11,500 feet
to 19,000 feet the tension of vapour differed but very little from - 13 inch
then the amount of water present in the same mass of air was nearly constant
for 8000 feet in vertical height ; immediately after this there were some
irregularities, and above 20,000 feet the air was dry, being almost free from

vapour.

                                           different instruments.

   Every simultaneous or nearly simultaneous determination of the dew-
point by the different instruments or methods was copied out, and then all
those determinations between every 1000 feet of elevation were collected
together, and in this way the first five columns of the following Table were
formed. The numbers in the last six columns were formed by taking the
differences between the temperatures of the respective dew-points in the same
horizontal line, or those taken at about the same height and elevation.

      The numbers in every one of these columns are affected with a change of
   sign, and, therefore, no certain difference is shown over the determination of
   the dew-point as found by any method or instrument over that found by
   any other.

   From all the results it would seem that the temperature of the dew-point
as deduced from the Dry- and Wet-bulb thermometers as ordinarily used has
a tendency to give a result a little too high, but to an amount that is less than

the probable error of observations, and that, therefore, it is a perfectly trust-
worth}' instrument to use, even to great altitudes ; also, the results by
Daniell's Hygrometer seem to be of equal value with those found by Eeg-

nault's Hygrometer, at all elevations.

              § 9. Electrical State of the Atmosphere.

In the ascent on July 17, an electrometer, kindly lent by Professor "W.

Thomson, of Glasgow, was used. Care (according to the instructions from

Professor Thomson) was taken to discharge the electricity from the balloon

on leaving the earth, and a charge of negative electricity was given to the

instrument, and it read 59°, which we may call the balloon-reading. The

instrument leaked a little, and it was necessary at every experiment to re-

determine the balloon-reading. The following are the results of the ob-

servations :

Now as these observations were made under the balloon, and the readings for

the air were large negative readings always, it implies that the air was
charged with positive electricity, but becoming less and less in amount with
increasing elevation, till at the height of 23,000 feet the amount was too
small to measure but was of the same kind. It is impossible therefore to
say whether at higher elevations there would have been no electricity, or
whether it would have changed to negative. I wish, however, to speak
guardedly on this subject, and would regard these observations as indications
only. I pledge myself no further than that all the directions given to me by
Professor Thomson were followed, and that the readings are correct.

                 On the Oxygenic Condition of the Atmosphere.

   On July 17th the test papers, both by Moffat and Schonbein, continued

untinged by colour throughout the whole flight of the balloon, and the same
result was found during the ascent on July 30.

    After these ascents I received the following letter from Dr. Moffat :

                                                         " Hawarden, August 4th, 1862.

Dear Mr. Glaisher,

" In the Times of Saturday last I observed, in your report of meteorological

observations taken during a balloon ascent from the Crystal Palace on July 30th,

that ' test ozone papers were not coloured, and no ozone was noticed in the

ascent from Wolverhampton.' This is remarkable, seeing that ozone increases

in quantity directly with increase of elevation on the earth's surface. The

degree of coloration of test papers varies with the humidity of the atmosphere.

Dry air retards the decomposition of the iodine of potassium, and very moist

air removes the iodine when decomposition has taken place. It does not

appear, however, in the observations, that the degree of humidity on the day

of ascent was in any way unfavourable to the decomposition of the iodine, or

the development of the brown colour on the test papers.

                                                                            2k2
484 report--186.2.

" The time the balloon was up was short (two hours), and ozone must be

in very considerable quantity to produce coloration of the test paper in so

short a period of time. Still, according to our present notions of increase of

the quantity of ozone with increase of elevation, papers of ordinary sensitive-

ness ought to have been coloured during the ascents. The sensitiveness of

the papers used in the investigation is of course of the utmost importance.
   " Today the quantity of ozone indicated by test papers prepared by

myself is 4 ; and two papers from a packet prepared by Messrs. Negretti

and Zambra, exposed for two hours in sunshine, did not show the slightest

tinge, while a slip prepared by myself, exposed under similar circumstances,

gave a degree of coloration equal to the mean of the day. From these

results it would appear that tbe test papers used by you were in fault. This

is a question of some moment, and one of great scientific interest ; and if

future balloon ascents give results similar to those you have reported, then

the ground of the development of ozone must be looked for in the atmosphere

near the surface of the earth.

                                "I am, yours very truly,

" Jas. Ghisher, Esq.''          (Signed) '                "T.Moffat."

    In consequence of the receipt of this letter I went to Hawarden to Dr. Moffat,
and induced him to make some test papers himself for the balloon experiments.

He did so, and they were used on August 18th. I took some of the papers

prepared by him, and some of the papers out of the same packets which I had

used during the two preceding ascents, as well as some prepared by a formula

of Schonbein. When I had reached 10,000 feet the new papers were decidedly

tinged; at 17,000 feet they were coloured to the amount of 2, on a scale
whose deepest colour is represented by 10 ; at 20,000 feet to 3. At 22,000

feet the coloration had increased to 4 ; and here Schbnbein's paper was
coloured to 1, and Moffat's old papers were still uncoloured. Moffat's
new papers gradually increased in intensity, and Avhen 3000 feet from the
earth at 2h 38m were deepened to 7. It would therefore appear that in all
probability the test papers were in fault in the first ascents ; and I may here
remark that, in consequence, the preparation of the ozone test papers has been

stopped, and that it is my intention, as Dr. Moffat himself cannot undertake

the task, to superintend the preparation of the papers myself in future.

                  Time of Vibration of a Magnet.

   On July 17, at Wolverhampton, there were

                                                                                                                      S. 9.

Therefore the time of vibration seemed to be somewhat longer.

of the magnet =1-573 second.

being sensibly the same as the result on the same day as determined at the

Observatory.

Therefore one vibration=l - 586 second.                 1-586

At 11,000 feet  26 vibrations =41-5 second.

=Therefore one vibration 1-590 second.

A result differing but little from that on the ground.

    August 20, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the time of one vibration
was 1-580 second.

   August 20, at the height of 3800 feet one vibration =1-583 second.

   On September 5, I did not succeed in getting the time of vibration of the

--magnet at all in the balloon. During this ascent we were almost constantly

going round and round a motion fatal to observations of this nature, and

failure at all times was the rule in these experiments. I commenced many

series of experiments with the axis of the car in one position relative to the
cardinal points of the compass, which I found to be different before the observa-
tions were completed, and consequently the observations were of no value.

    The general result of these experiments is that the magnet vibrates in
a somewhat longer interval of time at high elevations than on the earth.
The number of experiments, however, is too few to speak decidedly on this

point.

On the Propagation of Sound.

   On July 17, when at the height of 11,800 feet above the earth a band was

heard playing.

   On July 30, at 5450 feet a gun was heard with a sharp sound, then a
drum beating, and then a band was heard.

On August 18, at 4500 feet the shouting of people was heard.

,, at 18,000 feet a clap of thunder was heard.
,, at 20,000 feet thunder again heard, below us.
,, at 20,000 feet a loud clap of thunder was heard.

On August 20, at 4000 feet heard the shouts of people.

           ,, at 4300 feet railway whistle heard.
           ,, at 3500 feet heard bell tolling.
           ,, at 2200 feet heard people shouting.
           ,, at 3700 feet heard a clock strike.

On August 21, at 4900 feet a railway-train was heard.
          ,, at 8200 feet a gun was heard.

           ,, at 3500 feet heard people shouting.

On September 5, at 6730 feet, ascending, the report of a gun was heard.

          ,, at 10,070 feet, descending, the report of a gun was heard.

On September 8, at 3300 feet heard the shouts of people.

Prom these results we learn that different notes ^ and sounds pass more

Areadily through the air than others.  dog barking* has been heard at the

height of two miles ; a multitude of people shouting, not more than 4500 feet.

  On August 18 we heard at three different times what, in my Notes to the

Observations, I have called claps of thunder ; but I also remarked at these

times that a careful examination of the clouds below us failed to discover any

thunder-cloud. On inquiry afterwards as to the fact of thunder being heard
on the earth, we found none had been, and it was suggested that the sounds
ON EIGHT BALLOON ASCENTS IN 1862.                                491

we heard might have proceeded from Birmingham, where guns were being
proved on that day. It is possible this suggestion may be correct.

Physiological Observations.

  On July 17, before starting from "Wolverhampton, at my request Mr.
Coxwell took the number of his pulsations, and found 74 in one minute ; my

pulsations were 76 in one minute. At the height of 17,000 feet mine had
increased to 100, and Mr. Coxwell' s to 84. On regaining the ground the
number of both our pulsations was 76.

   On August 18, the number of our pulsations were both 76 before starting.
At the height of 22,000 feet mine had increased to 100, and Mr. Coxwell's
to 98 ; and afterwards, at a higher elevation, Mr. Coxwell's number was 110,

and mine 107.

On August 21, in the morning ascent no observations were taken of our

pulsations before leaving. At the height of 1000 feet the following results

were obtained :--Mr. Coxwell's, 95 in a minute; Mr. Ingelow's, 80 in a

--minute; Capt. Percival's, 90 in a minute. At 11,000 feet: Mr. Coxwell's,

90 in a minute; Mr. Ingelow's, 100 in a minute; Capt. Percival's, 88 in a.

minute ; mine, 88 in a minute ; my son's (a boy in his 14th year), 89 in

--a minute. At 14,000 feet the following were tbp results : Mr. Coxwell's,

94 in a minute; mine, 98 in a minute; Mr. Ingelow's, 112 in a minute;

myCapt. Percival's, 78 in a minute ;  son's, 89 in a minute. The pulsations

of Capt. Percival were so weak that he could scarcely count them, whilst

those of Mr. Coxwell, he considered, had increased in strength.

   These results show that the effect of diminished pressure exercises a very
different influence upon different individuals, depending probably upon tem-
perament and organization.

   In the ascent on July 17, at the height of 19,000 feet the hands and lips
were noted as dark bluish, but not the face. At the height of four miles the
palpitations of the heart were audible and the breathing was affected, and
at higher elevations considerable difficulty was experienced in respiration.

On August 18, the hands and face were blue at the height of 23,000 feet.

   On September 5, at the height of about 29,000 feet I became unconscious,

and at the height of about 35,000 feet Mr. Coxwell lost the use of his hands.
At the height of about 29,000 feetT began to recover, and resumed observing
at the height of 25,000 feet.

   From these results it would seem that the effect of high elevations is dif-
ferent upon the same individual at different times.

                                          General Remarks.

   These eight ascents have led me to conclude, firstly, that it was necessary

to employ a balloon containing nearly 90,000 cubic feet of gas ; and that it
was impossible to get so high as six miles, even with a balloon of this mag-
nitude, unless carburetted hydrogen, varying in specific gravity from 370 to
330, had been supplied for the purpose.

   It is true that these statements are rather conflicting when compared with
the statements made by one or two early travellers, who professed to have
reached some miles in height with small balloons. But if we recollect that
at 3| miles high a volume of gas will double its bulk, we have at once a
ready means of determining how high a balloon can go ; and in order to reach

an elevation of six or seven miles it is obvious that one-third of the capacity
of the balloon should be able to support the entire weight of the balloon, in-

clusive of sufficient ballast for the descent.

   The amount of ballast taken up affords another clue as to the power of
reaching great heights. Gay-Lussac's ballast, as before mentioned, was re-
duced to 33 lbs. Hush and Green, when their barometers, as stated by them,
stood at 11 inches, had only 70 lbs. left, and this was considered a sufficient
playing-power. "We found that it was desirable to reserve five or six hun-
dred pounds ; and although we could have gone higher by saving less, still
on every occasion it was evident that a large amount of ballast was indis-
pensable to regulate the descent and select a favourable spot for landing.

    Secondly, it was manifest throughout our various journeys that excessive
altitude and extended range as to distance are quite incompatible. The
reading of the instruments establishes this ; and it has been pointed out what

a short time the balloon held its highest place, and how reluctantly it ap-

peared to linger even at a somewhat less elevation. This was not owing to
any leakage or imperfection in the balloon itself, for its efficiency has been
well tested, and it remained intact a whole night without the least percep-

tible loss of gas.

    It has been stated by an aeronaut of experience that strong opposing upper
currents have been heard to produce an audible contention, and to sound like
the "roaring of a hurricane." Now, the only deviation we experienced from
the most perfect stillness was a slight whirring noise in the netting, and this
only when the balloon was rising with great rapidity, and a slight flapping
on descending, when the balloon is in a collapsed state.

   I may also state that the too readily accepted theory as to the prevalence
of a settled west or north-west wind was not confirmed in our trips. Nor

was the appearance of the upper surface of the clouds such as to establish
the theory that the eloiids assume a counterpart of the earth's surface below,
and rise or fall like hills or dales.

    The formation of vapour along the course and sinuosities of the river
during an ascent from the Crystal Palace has been already alluded to ; this
was a very remarkable demonstration.

                                        General Conclusions.

   Perhaps the most important conclusions which can be drawn from the

experiments at present are :

       1. That the temperature of the air does not decrease uniformly with
               increase of elevation above the earth's surface, and consequently
              the theory of a decline of temperature of 1° in every 300 feet must
494 bepobt--1862.

              be abandoned. In some eases, with a clear sky, the decline of 1°
               has taken place within 100 feet of the earth, and for a like decrease
               of temperature it is necessary to pass through more than 1000 feet
                at heights exceeding 5 miles.

                  The determination of the decrease of temperature with elevation,
               and its law, is most important, and the balloon is the only means
             by which this element can be determined ; very many more experi-
               ments are, however, necessary.
       2. That the humidity of the air decreases with height in a wonder-
               fully decreasing ratio, till at heights exceeding five miles the amount
                of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere is veiy small indeed.
       3. That an aneroid barometer read correctly to the first place, and
               probably to the second place of decimals, to a pressure as low as
                7 inches.
       4. That dry- and wet-bulb thermometers can be used effectively up to

             any heights on the earth's surface where man can be located.
      5. That the balloon affords a means of solving with advantage many

                  delicate questions in physics ; and,

       6. That the observations can be made with tolerable safety to the
             observer ; and therefore that the balloon may be used as a philoso-

                phical agent in niany investigations.

different from zero) " No form can be transformed into the product of two

can be combined by multiplication so as to produce a third form transformable

into their product, their covariants are all either identically zero or else are

powers of the forms themselves. There is, consequently, no general theory

of composition for any forms other than quadratic forms, because all other

sorts of forms have covariants which cannot be supposed equal to zero, or to

a multiple of a power of the form itself, without particularizing the nature

of the form. And even as regards quadratic forms, we may infer that com-

position is possible only in cases of continually increasing particularity, as

the number of indeterminates increases.

according as /,/', and F are derived from properly or improperly primitive

forms, we conclude that if f and f be both derived from properly primitive

forms, the form compounded of them is also derived from a properly primitive

form ; but if either f or f be derived from an improperly punitive form, the

form compounded of them is derived from a similar form. (Gauss's 6th con-

clusion.)

   In the transformation of F into fxf, the form / is said to be taken
directly or inversely, according as the fraction n is positive or negative. And

/similarly for and ri.

In order, therefore, to find a form, F, compounded directly or inversely of two

given forms of -which the determinants are to one another as two squares, we

have to find eleven integral and two fractional numbers, satisfying the equa-

Vtions (a) and (£!'), in which a, b, c, a', , c' , and the signs of n and n' , are

p p palone given ; the numbers ^j 2 2 3 , q qx q2 q3 , being further subject to the

condition that the determinants of the matrix P0P1P2P3 are to admit of

                                                                                                    ?0 ?1 ?2 ?3

--PUminants satisfy the identical relation QT-|-KS=0 ; from which we

                                                                     S, B+S, T,                     must be relatively prime,

if P, Q, B, S, T, TJ are to be so ; and secondly, substituting for the* determi-

nants their values given by the first six of the equations (12), that dn' 2 =d'ni .

E --Denoting by c and S the greatest common divisors of P,                                                       S, U and of

if T, Ti denote positive or negative units, according as the transformations of

<i> into F, and/, into fi are proper or improper, while ^denotes a positive or

negative unit according as f. is taken directly or inversely, <pi will be taken

directly or inversely according as T x r x i^ is positive or negative. This is
                                                                                                                                                                            t

apparent if we observe that the sign of the quantity ^- ' is altered by an im-

proper   transformation                 of   X,       Y,          or                                                  x      yt ,  but  is  not               altered  by  a  transformation

The theorem that " forms compounded of equivalent forms, similarly taken,

Weare themselves equivalent" is included in the preceding.                                                                                                                    may, there-

fore, speak of the class compounded of any number of given classes.

By this theorem, the problem of finding a form compounded of any number of

given forms is reduced to the problem of finding a form compounded of two

given forms.       For                           f fif         .       .fn      be     the  given                  forms,  we  may compound                       the     first
                                                           x2

with the second, the residting form with the third, and so on until we have

gone through all the forms, when the form finally obtained will be compounded

of the given forms, as will immediately appear from successive applications of

Wethe preceding theorem.                                                        also see that we may compound the forms in

any order that we please, or we may divide them into sets in any way we

please, and compounding first the forms of each set, afterwards compound the

resulting forms. If any of the given forms are to be taken inversely, we may

Wesubstitute for them their opposites (Art. 92) taken directly.                                                                                                   may thus,

without any loss of generality, and with some gain in point of simplicity,

avoid the consideration of inverse composition altogether ; and, for the future,

when we speak of the form compounded of given forms, or the class com-
pounded of given classes, we shall understand the form or class compounded

directly of the given forms or classes.

110. The solution of the problem of composition given in Art. 108 may be

put into a form better suited to actual computation.

   The system (S) is evidently satisfied by [0, P, Q, R], and also by

-- --[P, 0, S, T]; and these solutions are independent, because the determi-

nants of their matrix cannot all be zero unless P=0, a supposition which
may be rejected as it implies that a=0, i. e.«that d is a square. From this

set of independent solutions a set of fundamental solutions is deduced, as fol-

Rlows. Let n be the greatest common divisor of P, Q, ; and let k be deter-

mined by the congruences h                                                             S=0, h                      T=0, mod-, which are simul-

-- --111. Composition of Forms Method of Dirichlet. Lejeune Dirichlet, in

an academic dissertation (" De formarum binariarum secundi gradus com-

positione," Crelle, vol. xlvii. p. 155), has deduced the theory of the composi-

tion of forms from that of the representation of numbers. The principles of

this method are applicable to any case of composition; but Dirichlet has

restricted his investigation to properly primitive forms of the same deter-
M Wminant D. Let (a, b, c), (a!, b' , c') be two such forms ; let and
                                                                                      be two

of \J~D, so that w2 =D, mod M, w'2 =D, mod M', and so that the forms

   * Crelle's Journal, vol. lvi. p. 64. In the new edition of the Disq. Arith. (Gottingen,

B1863), a MS. note of Gauss is printed at p. 263, containing the congruences by -which

is determined in the case of the direct composition of two forms of the same determinant.

The account of the theory of composition in the preceding articles (106-109) differs

from that in the Disq. Arith. (arts. 234-243) chiefly in the use which is here made of the

Ainvariant property of the determinant.     different mode of treatment of Gauss's analysis

is adopted by M. Bazin, in Liouville, vol. xvi. p. 161.

In Arts. 108 and 110 we have endeavoured to supply the analysis of a problem -which

Gauss, as is not unusual with him, has treated in a purely synthetical manner (Disq.

Arith., arts. 236 and 242, 243) ; and it is for this reason that we have introduced the con-

sideration of fundamental sets of solutions of indeterminate systems, which are not ex-

plicitly mentioned in the Disq. Arith. It is perhaps singular that Gauss does not employ

PU -- =the identity

To prove this, a few preliminary remarks are necessary. (1.) If the solu-

the solution comprehending them. (4.) The value of s/D to which any

M=o»rgiven primitive representation (such as                  -\-2hmn-\-cn-) appertains,

may be denned by congruences, without employing the numbers /j. and v

    We may suppose that the given forms (a, b, c) and («', b', c') are so prepared*

that the representations of a and a' by them appertain to concordant values

From this equation (which is included as a particular case in the formulas

of M. Arndt) it appears that MM' is capable of representation by {cm', B, C) ;

it  can  also      be  shown  (1)  that     this  representation  is   primitive                                    (2) that

it appertains to a value of s/T), mod MM', comprehending the values to

Mand w', to which the representations of                  and M' by (a, b, c) and (a', b' , c')

Yrespectively appertain. (1.) If x, y, x', y', and X, are the values of the

indeterminates in the representations of M, M', and MM' by («, B, a'C),

X Y(«', B, «C) and («a', B, C), the hypothesis that and admit of a common
--pprime divisor is expressed by the simultaneous congruences xx' Cyy'^O,

axy' -\-a'x'y-{-2Byy'^0, mod p. These congruences are linear in respect

of the relatively prime numbers x' and y' ; their coexistence implies,

Mtherefore, that p divides their determinant ; similarly it may be shown

that j) divides M'; so that a>=w', mod p, because w and u> are concordant.

+The congruences satisfied by u> and w' now give the relations ax+(B u))y=0,

    * It is readily proved that a properly primitive form can represent numbers prime to

any given number ; tmis a form can always be found equivalent to a given properly pri-

mitive form, and having its first coefficient prime to a given number. This transformation

will be frequently employed hi the sequel. ... In the present instance, we have only to

substitute for the given forms any two forms respectively equivalent to them and having

their first coefficients relatively prime.

It will be seen that Dirichlet's method may be applied to the composition

of any number of forms, and that the theorems of Art. 109 present them-

selves as immediate consequences of his definition of composition.

"We represent these classes by the letters /, <p, . . . , and we use the signs of

"A(ii.)

In consequence of this property, it is sometimes convenient to represent the

principal class by 1.

French translator, and to have been acquiesced in by subsequent writers.

tain opposite forms (see Art. 92).

   (vii.) " The class compounded of the opposites of two or more forms is the
opposite of the class compounded of those forms." It follows from this, or

from vi., that a class compounded of ambiguous classes is itself ambiguous.

It is also readily seen that every equation of the type 4>,, x/=«I>K admits of h
solutions ; and thus it only remains to justify the assumption on which the

mpreceding proof depends. If the order £1 be derived by the multiplier from

--class represented by the form (m, 0, Am) ; if £1 be derived from an im-

properly primitive class, we take for <I> the class represented by the form

m --(2m, m,--^-- ). Representing <£M in the first case by the form (ma, mb,

me), and in the second by the form (2ma, mb, 2mc), and supposing (as we may

mdo) that a in each case is prime to 2D, we see that the forms (a, mb,  2    and

(a, bm, 4cm2 ) are properly primitive; and we find by the formula? of compo-

sition (Art. 110),

               -- =(m, 0, Am) x (a, bm, cm2 ) (ma, mb, mc)

i. e. the equation $ x/=<iv can be satisfied for every value of p.

ploys the theory of composition to compare the number of properly pri-

in any other order of the same determinant ; or, which comes to the same

thing, to compare the numbers of classes, of any given orders, of two de-

terminants which are to one another as square numbers (Disq. Arith., art.

We253-256).         have already seen (Art. 103) that the infinitesimal analysis

of Dirichlet supplies a complete solution of this problem ; whereas, in the case
of a positive determinant, the result in its simplest form was not obtained

by Gauss. It has, however, been recently shown by M. Lipschitz (Crelle,
vol. liii. p. 238) that the formulas of Dirichlet may be deduced, in a very ele-

mentary manner, from the theory of transformation. "We propose in this

   The properly primitive classes of det. De2 , into which a given properly

Dprimitive class (a, b, c) of det. is transformable, are always such that, com-

pounded with the class (e, 0,-- De), they produce the class (ea, eb, ec). For

let (a, b, c) be transformable into (A, B, C) of det. De2 , and let us take a form

of the type (A, B'e, C'e2 ), equivalent to (A, B, C) ; then (a, b, c) and (A, B', C)

--are equivalent. But (e, o, De) x (A, B'e, CV)=(eA, eB', eC), therefore also
-- =(e, 0, De) x (A, B, C) (ea, eb, ec). And conversely the classes which, com-
--pounded with (e, 0, De), produce (ea, eb, ec) are precisely the classes into

which (a, b, c) is transformable. Thus the properly primitive classes of det.

--De2, which compounded with (e, 0, De) reproduce that class itself, are no
--other than the properly primitive classes of det. De2 into which (1, 0, D)

is transformable. And it is by this substitution of a problem of transforma-

tion for a problem of composition that M. Lipschitz has simplified and com-

pleted the analysis of Gauss.

    A method similar in principle is applicable to the comparison of the num-

Webers of properly and improperly primitive classes.                                                                      can first show that if

DD=l, mod. 4, the double of every properly primitive class of det. arises

by a transformation of modulus 2 from one, and only one, improperly primi-

tive class of the same determinant ; viz. if (a, b, e) is a given properly primitive

these two forms are equivalent, because (a,b, c) is transformable into (4p, 2q , 4/-)
and also into (4//, 2q', 4r'), while it can be shown that (a, 6, c) is transform-

able into the double of only one improperly primitive class. Also, applying

be negative, the three forms will belong to different classes ; and there 'will

be three times as many properly as improperly primitive classes. From this
statement, however, we must except the determinant --3, which has one

properly and one improperly primitive class.

   It will be found that the properly primitive class or classes, into the double
of which a given improperly primitive class can be transformed, and which in

turn can be transformed into the double of the given class, are also the class

-- --_or classes which compounded with the class I 2, 0,                                                                                -          produce the given

class. Thus every improperly primitive class is connected either with one or

-- /three properly primitive classes (see Art. 98, note, and Art. 118).
    114. Composition of Genera. Let and /' be two properly primitive

m mclasses of det. D, and two numbers prime to one another and to 2D,

fand represented by/ and respectively; then mm! is represented by/x/'.
fxfHence the generic character of           is obtained by multiplying together the

values of the particular characters of/ and/". For those generic characters

which are expressed by quadratic symbols this is evident, since

                              fmm'\_/m\ /m'\
                                                                                                                                     _

and it is equally true for the supplementary characters, since it will be found

that               TO--       m'--          m-m'2-- 1                                                                                      TO*--                                    m*8 --

fxfThe genus T, in which      is contained, is said to be compounded of the

genera y and y', in which / and f are contained ; and this composition is
expressed by the symbolic equation r=yXy'. It will be seen that the

composition of any genus with itself gives the principal genus.

   The same considerations may be extended to improperly primitive classes.

mThus, if/ and/' be respectively properly and improperly primitive, andm'

uneven numbers prime to one another and to T), represented by / and \f

the genus of the improperly primitive class, /x/', may be inferred from the

number mm', i.e. it is obtained by .the composition of the generic characters

of/ and/'. Or, again, if/ and /' be both improperly primitive, so that the

class compounded of them is the double of an improperly primitive class, the
generic character of this improperly primitive class is obtained by compound-

ing those of the two given classes.

It follows, from these principles, that the number of classes in any two

genera [of the same order] is the same.       $For if                                                                                   $,,v <b2 , . . .  be all the

                                                                                                                                                                                 t

belonging to "any other genus of the same order, and <j> a properly primitive

X0=Fclass satisfying the equation $         *«Xf, the classes; $, x^>, . . . .
                              11

are all different, and all belong to the genus (F) ; consequently (F) has at

least as many classes as ($), and vice versa ($) has at least as many as (F),

i. e. they both contain the same number of classes.

   115. Determination of the Number of Ambiguous Classes, and Demon-

--stration of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. The number of actually

existing genera of properly primitive forms cannot exceed the number of

properly primitive ambiguous classes. For let n be the number of classes

in each genus, Tc the number of actually existing genera, so that Ten is the

Anumber of properly primitive classes; let also 1, A,, 2 , . . . Ai_i be the pro-

perly primitive ambiguous classes. Every class produces, by its duplication,

Ka class of the principal genus ; and if be a class of the principal genus
520 report--1862.

Kproduced by the duplication of X, is also produced by the duplication of

X XxA,,,.Xxx A,,  Aj-!, but by the duplication of no other class. If,

therefore, there be ri classes in the principal genus which can be produced

by duplication, the whole number of properly primitive classes is hxn',

i. e. Tm'=Tcn. But n<n, therefore 1c<K.

It may be inferred from Art. 112, vii., that all genera "which contain any

ambiguous classes contain an equal number of them. "We shall immediately

see that the number of ambiguous classes is equal to the number of genera,

and is consequently a power of 2. The number of ambiguous classes in any

genus is, therefore, either zero or a power of 2 ; and if any genus contain

--2K ambiguous classes, such classes will exist only in  genera.
                                         2K

   Gauss determines the number h of properly primitive ambiguous classes

by very elementary reasoning. He first finds the number of properly primitive

ambiguous forms of one or other of the two types (A, 0, C) and (23, B, C),

and then assigns the number of non -equivalent classes in which these forms

Dare contained. Let be divisible by /u different primes ; and let us except

D= --the case     D1. Resolving in every possible manner into two positive or

negative factors, having no common divisor but unit}", we find 2^+' properly

primitive forms of the type (A, 0, C) ; but we shall diminish this number by

one-half by rejecting one of the two equivalent forms (A, 0, C) and(C, 0, A),

viz. that in which [A]>[C]. There are no properly primitive forms of the

type (2B, B, C) unless D=3, mod. 4, or D=0, mod. 8 ; for one or other of
D=B --these congruences is implied by the equation
                                         (B 20), because C is

Duneven. Resolving into any two factors relatively prime, if D=3, mod. 4,

and having 2 for their greatest common divisor, if D=0, mod. 8, we take one

B--of them for B, the other for  2C ; and we obtain, in either case, +2it 1 pro-
= --perly primitive forms of the type (2B, B, C). If BB
                                                         D, it is easily seen

Wethat the forms (2B, B, C) and (2B', B', C')* are equivalent.    may thus

diminish by one-half the number of forms of the type (2B, B, C), rejecting

Wethose in which [B]> ^[1)].     conclude, therefore, that if we now denote

by p. the number of uneven primes dividing D, we have in all 2^+ 2 ambiguous

forms when D=0, mod. 8, 2^ when D=l, or =5, mod. 8, and 2^+' in every

other case. These ambiguous forms we shall call D., and we observe that

their number is equal to the whole number of assignable generic characters

(Art. 98).

   To find the number of non-equivalent classes in which these forms are
contained, we consider separately the case of a positive and of a negative
determinant. For a negative determinant, we diminish by one-half the

number of the forms by rejecting the negative forms. The remaining forms,

A<Cif of the type (A, 0, C), are evidently reduced, because  ; if of the type

(2B, B, C), they are also reduced, unless 2B>C, an inequalitv which implies

-that (0, C B, C) , to which (2B, B, C ) is equivalent, is reduced (Art. 92). The

number of [positive] ambiguous classes is, therefore, one-half the number of

the ambiguous forms £2.

   For a positive determinant, we deduce from the forms £2 an equal number

of reduced ambiguous forms. Thus (A, 0, C) is equivalent to (A, Z A, C)
and because [A]< »JT), this form is reduced, if k\ be positive and be the

greatest multiple of [A] not surpassing ^D. Similarly (2B, (2/c+l) B, C)

+is equivalent to (2B, B, C), and is reduced if (27c 1) B be positive, and be

the greatest uneven multiple of [B] not surpassing VD. There are, there-
fore, as many reduced ambiguous forms as there are forms in £2 ; and there

are no more, because it is readily seen that every reduced ambiguous form

is included in one or other of the two series of forms (A, AA, C) and

+(2B, (2£ l)B, C) -which we have obtained. But every ambiguous class

contains two reduced ambiguous forms (Art. 94) ; we infer, therefore, that for
positive as well as for negative determinants the number of ambiguous classes
is one-half the number of the forms £2, i. e. one-half of the number of assign-

able generic characters.

   Combining this result with the theorem at the commencement of this

article, we obtain a proof of the impossibility of at least one-half of the
assignable generic characters. As this proof is independent of the law of
quadratic reciprocity, we may employ the result to demonstrate that law.

+two primes, and first let one of them, as p, be of the form 4*1 1. If ( -

 --116. Equality of the Ifumber of Genera and of Ambiguous Classes.

In the preceding article it has only been shown that h cannot exceed h.
But, as Ave have already seen (Art. 102) that the number of actually
existing genera is one-half the whole number of assignable generic

characters, we know that £=/». To prove this, by the principles of the
composition of forms, it is sufficient to show that n=n' , i. e. that the
problem " to find a class which by its duplication shall produce a given class

of the principal genus " is always resoluble. This problem Gauss actually
solves (Disq. Arith., art. 286, 287) ; he shows, first, that any proposed

binary form, belonging to the principal genus of its own determinant, can be
522 report--1862.

X --represented by the ternary quadratic form 2 2YZ; and, secondly, that

from this representation we can always deduce a binary form, which shall

produce by its duplication the proposed form. This solution implies a pre-

vious investigation of the theory of ternary quadratic forms, and cannot be

properly introduced here.

     A more elementary method, however, has been given by M. Arndt (Crelle,

D= Dlvi. p. 72). Let
                       AS2 , S2 representing any square dividing ; M. Arndt

observes that the ratio of the number of actually existing genera to the

whole number of assignable generic characters is the same for each of the

two determinants D and A. To prove this we make use of the following sub-

sidiary proposition :

     " If /=(«, b, c) be a properly primitive form of any det. D, and if 8M and

     be two numbers relatively prime, the necessary and sufficient condition for

/is that the supplementary characters of (if any), and the particular cha-

Mracters of/ (if any) which relate to uneven primes dividing both and D,

should coincide with the corresponding characters of 9."

  We may add (though this is not necessary for our present purpose), that if

(3,  and  9     be  two values of #  for each of which  the  congruence                                                                                (A)  is  resoluble,

             2

it is resoluble for each an equal number of times.

     On reference to the Table in Art. 98, it will be seen that the particular

characters proper to the determinant A are included among the particular

characters proper to D. Let then (r) and (r, r') represent any two com-

Aplete generic characters for the determinants and D, the particular cha-

racters common to the two complete characters having the same values attri-

buted to them in each. It may then be shown that the genus (r, J?') is or

is not an existent genus, according as (r) is or is not existent. For (1) if

(T, r") be actually existent, let 6 be a number prime to 2D and capable of

primitive representation by some     class of that genus                                                                                               the congruence w2 =D,
                                                                                                                                                    ;

=A,mod. 9 is therefore resoluble ; i. e. the congruence w2                                                                                             mod. fi, is resoluble,

so that (3 can be represented by a class of properly primitive forms of det. A,

or the genus (r) is actually existent. And (2) if (r) be an existing genus,
let /be a form included in (r), and # a number prime to 2D and satisfying

the generic character (r, r"). It appears from the subsidiary proposition

+that some number of the linear form 8mD 9 is capable of representation

by/; if $ be the greatest common divisor of the indeterminates in the repre-

=sentation of by /, the congruence w2 A, and consequently the congruence

                                     '

                                             .

                                     ; i. e. , the character of which coincides
-- --u'=D, is resoluble for the modulus

with the character of Q, and therefore with that of the genus (r, r"), is capa-
ble of representation by a form of det. D, or (r, r') is an actually existing

genus.

   If, then, k be the number of particular characters contained in (r, r') and
not in (r), the numbers of actually existing genera and assignable generic

Dcharacters for the det. are each 2* times the corresponding numbers for the

det. A.
   It appears from this result that it will be sufficient for our present purpose

to consider determinants not divisible by any square. If (a, b, c) be a form
of the principal genus of such a determinant (we suppose that a is prime to

+ +D), the equation ax'2 2bxy cy2 =a}2 is resoluble with values of o> prime to

Dtheorem of Legendre* ; and the values of £ which satisfy it are prime to ;

whence, if x=fi                , y=fxt], io=/j.j, /i denoting a multiplier, which renders

the values of x, y, and u> integral and relatively prime, the equation

+ =ax2 -f 2bxy cy2 or will be satisfied, and the values of w will be prime to D.

The form (a, b, c) is therefore equivalent to a form of the type (w2 , A, v) ; and

this form is produced by the duplication of (w, X, vu>) if w be uneven, and of

+(2m, \ u, v) if o) be even.

class  of  the principal       genus,     the  C Cclasses C,                      2     3      .  . will all belong to that

genus. And it will be found, by reasoning similar to that employed in

Euler's second proof of Fermat's theorem (see Art. 10 of this Report), (1)

that the classes 1, C, C% . . . are all different until we arrive at a class (>,

equivalent to the principal class ; (2) that /x is either equal to, or a divisor of,

0=1,the number n of classes in the principal genus ; (3) that if                                            r is a mul-

                    /i classes C, , , . . .                                    ,

class C ; C is said to appertain to the exponent fx ; and the determinant is

regular or irregular according as classes do or do not exist which appertain

to the exponent n. With the former case we may compare the theory of the

residues of powers for a prime modulus ; with the latter the same theory for

a modulus composed of different primes (see Art. 77).

   (i.) When the determinant is regular, we may take any class appertaining

to the exponent n as a basis, and may represent all the classes of the principal

genus (to which wc at present confine ourselves) as its powers. It will then

appear (1) that if d be a divisor of n, the number of classes appertaining to

the   exponent      d is  (d)-<//  ;  s0  that, for example, the                                  number    of classes  that

X =lmay be taken for a base is \p (n) : (2) that if ef=n, the equation (,                                               will

be satisfied by e classes of the principal genus ; and if these classes be repre-

equation X^=l, where cl is the greatest common divisor of h and n.

    X =lIt will be seen in particular that the equation 2                                         admits of only one,

or only two solutions, according as n is uneven or even ; i. e. the principal

genus of a regular determinant cannot contain more than two ambiguous

classes.

To obtain a class appertaining to the exponent n, Gauss employs the same

method which        serves     to find    a  primitive root of                          a      prime   number (Art.       13

and B be two classes appertaining to the exponents a and /3, neither of which

divides the other, and if M, the least common multiple of a and (5, be re-

p psolved into two factors and q, relatively pi-ime and such that divides a

and q divides fi, the class AP x B« will appertain to the exponent M.

third, &c, exponents of irregularity. From the mode in which the formula

C/ 1  X           2  X  .   . is obtained, it   can  be  inferred                                         that   fl     is divisible by          62 , by

3, and so on ; whence it appears that a determinant cannot be irregular un-

less n be a divisible by a square ; nor can it have r indices of irregularity

unless n be divisible by a power of order r+1. Moreover, whenever the

principal genus contains but one ambiguous class, the determinant is either

regular or has an uneven exponent of irregularity ; if, on the contrary, the

principal genus contain more than two ambiguous classes, the determinant is

certainly irregular, and the index of irregularity even ; if it contain 2K ambi-

guous classes, the irregularity is at least of order k, and the k exponents of

irregularity are all even.

  A few further observations are added by Gauss. Irregularity is of much

less frequent occurrence for positive than for negative determinants ; nor

had Gauss found any instance of a positive determinant having an uneven

index of irregularity (though it can hardly be doubted that such determinants

--exist). The negative determinants included in the formulas, D=216/t+27,
= 1000fc+75, =1000/1-4-675, except --27 and --75, are irregular, and have

an index of irregularity divisible by 3. In the first thousand there are five

negative determinants (576, 580, 820, 884, 900) which have 2 for their

exponent of irregularity, and eight (243, 307, 339, 459, 675, 755, 891, 974)

which have 3 for that exponent ; the numbers of determinants having these

exponents of irregularity are 13 and 15 for the second thousand, 31 and

32 for the tenth. Up to 10,000 there are, possibly, no determinants having

any other exponents of irregularity; but it would seem that beyond that

--limit the exponent of irregularity may have any value.
   118. Arrangement of the other Genera. In the preceding article we have

attended to the classes of the principal genus only; to obtain a natural

arrangement of all the properly primitive classes, we observe that, if the

+ +rnumber of genera be 2^, the terms of the product (1 4- I\) (1 r,,) (1                                                                        )...

+(1 T^), in which T% represents any genus not already included in the product

+of the i-- 1 factors preceding 1 T,-, will represent all the genera. If, then,
AA,, 2 , . . . A^ represent any classes of the genera I',, r,, . . 1^. respectively,

and |C| be the formula representing all the classes of the principal genus, the

+expression |K|=|C| x (1+AJ (1+A2) ._. . (1 AM ) supplies a type for a simple

arrangement of all the classes of the given determinant. When every genus

A Acontains an ambiguous class, it is natural to take for                                                                    2 , . . A^, the ambi-

one such class, the number of improperly primitive classes is equal to that

the properly primitive classes, the improperly primitive classes will be repre-

Sxsented by                            |K|. When there are three properly primitive classes, which,

   119. Tabulation of Quadratic Forms. In Crelle's Journal, vol. lx. p. 357,
Mr. Cayley has tabulated the classes of properly and improperly primitive
forms for every positive and negative determinant (except positive squares)
up to 100. The classes are represented by the simplest forms contained in
them i ; the generic character of each class, and, for positive determinants,
the period of reduced forms (Art. 93) contained in it, are also given. The

quisite for the construction of the complete system of classes is therefore /i in either case,

since C^ may be replaced by Q2 V

determinant are extended in the text to irregular determinants. If the determinant have

k' uneven exponents of irregularity, the number of classes requisite for the construction

cient of all forms contained in the class, and the least second coefficient of all forms con-
tained in the class and having the least first coefficient. If a choice presents itself between
two numbers differing only in sign, the positive number is preferred. In the case of an
ambiguous class of a positive determinant, the simplest ambiguous form contained in the

class is taken as its representative.

arrangement of the genera and classes is in accordance with the construction

of Gauss, explained in the preceding articles ; and the position of each class

in the arrangement is indicated by placing opposite to it, in a separate column,

the term to ·which it corresponds in the symbolic formula (such as |K| or S x |K|)
which forms the type of the arrangement. To the two Tables of positive and

negative determinants Mr. Cayley has added a third, containing the thirteen

irregular negative determinants of the first thousand.

   In a letter addressed to Schumacher, and dated May 17, 1841, Gauss

expresses a decided opinion of the uselessness of an extended tabulation of
quadratic forms. " If, without having seen M. Clausen's Table, I have

formed a right conjecture as to its object, I shall not be able to express an

opinion in favour of its being printed. If it is a canon of the classification

of binary forms for some thousand determinants, that is to say, if it is a

Table of the reduced forms contained in every class, I should not attach any

importance to its publication. You will see, on reference to the Disq. Arith.

p. 521 (note), that in the year 1800 I had made this computation for more
than four thousand determinants " [viz. for the first three and tenth thou-
sands, for many hundreds here and there, and for many single determinants
besides, chosen for special reasons] ; " I have since extended it to many others

but I have never thought it was of any use to preserve these developments,

and I have only kept the final result for each determinant. For example, for the

determinant --11,921, 1 have not preserved the whole system, which would

certainly fill several pages *, but only the statement that there are 8 genera,

each containing 21 classes. Thus, all that I have kept is the simple state-

ment viii. 21, which in my own papers is expressed even more briefly. I

think it quite superfluous to preserve the system itself, and much more so to

print it, because (1) any one, after a little practice, can easily, without much

expenditure of time, compute for himself a Table of any particular determi-

nant, if he should happen to want it, especially when he has a means of

verification in such a statement as viii. 21 ; (2) because the work has a cer-
tain charm of its own, so that it is a real pleasure to spend a quarter of an

hour in doing it for one's self; and the more so, because (3) it is very seldom

that there is any occasion to do it  My own abbreviated Table of the

number of genera and classes I have never published, principally because it

does not proceed uninterruptedly." t Probably the third of Gauss's three

reasons will commend itself most to mathematicians who do not possess his

extraordinary powers of computation. An abbreviated Table of the kind he

+describes, extending from --10,000 to 10,000, would occupy only a very

limited space, and might be computed from Dirichlet's formulae for the

number of classes (see Art. 104), without constructing systems of repre-

sentative forms. But it would, perhaps, be desirable (nor would it increase

the bulk of the Table to any enormous extent) to give for each determinant

not only the number of genera, and of classes in each genus, but also the

elements necessary for the construction, by composition only, of a complete

system of all the classes. For this purpose it would not be necessary to

specify (by means of representative forms) more than 5 or 6 classes,' in the

case of any determinant within the limits mentioned.

   * Mr. Cayley's Table of the first hundred negative determinants occupies about four
pages of Crelle's Journal; the determinant --11,921 would occupy about one page,

   At Nottingham the meteor passed sixty-three miles over London, seeking an

   At Hay (South Wales) the meteor passed fifty-seven miles over London,

seeking an earth-point 70° E. from S.

   At Torquay the meteor passed 57f miles over London, seeking an earth-
point 9° E. from N.

   At Hau'lhurst the meteor passed forty-seven miles over London, seeking

  An earth-point seven miles S.W. from Hereford satisfies the observations

in the following manner :

London,     70° W. from TS. (observed 69° W. from N.).

Nottingham, 46° W. from S. (observed 42° W. from S.).

Hay,        70° E. from S. (observed 70° E. from S.).

the observation at that place ; but its distance is on the other hand 120 miles

from London, where the meteor appears to have been fifty-six miles above the

earth. The path of the meteor was therefore inclined downwards, from 25°

Aabove the horizon towards 70° W. of N.  visible flight of 115 miles, from

eighty-three miles over Canterbury to thirty-three miles over Oxford, per-

formed in three to four seconds of time, is the result obtained from the

        Address by Gr. G. Stokes, M.A., F.B.8. fyc, Lucasian Professor of

                           Mathematics in the University of Cambridge.

It has been customary for some years, in opening the business of the Section, for
the President to say a few words respecting the object of our meetings. In this Sec-

tion, more perhaps than in any other, we have frequently to deal with subjects of
a very abstract character, which in many cases can be mastered only by patient
study, at leisure, of what has been written. The question may not unnaturally be

--nsked If investigations of this kind can best be followed by quiet study in one's

own room, what is the use of bringing them forward in a sectional meeting at all ?
I believe that good may be done by public mention, in a meeting like the present,
of even somewhat abstract investigations ; but whether good is thus done, or the
audience are merely wearied to no purpose, depends upon the judiciousness of the

person by whom the investigation is brought forward. It must be remembered that

minute details cannot be followed in an exposition vivd voce ; they must be studied
at leisure ; and the aim of an author should be to present the broad leading ideas
of his research, and the principal conclusions at which he has arrived, clearly and

briefly before the Section. It is then possible to discuss the subject-matter; to

offer suggestions of new lines of experiment, or new combinations of ideas ; and
such discussions and suggestions, it seems to me, are among the most import-
ant business of a meeting such as this. Any one who has worked in concert

with another zealously engaged in the same research must have felt the benefit
arising from the mutual interchange of ideas between two different minds. Sug-

gestions struck out by one call up new trains of thought and fructify in the mind
of another ; whereas they might have remained barren and unfruitful in the mind
of the original suggester. The benefit of cooperation is by no means confined to

the carrying out, according to a preconcerted plan, of a research involving labour
rather than invention ; it is felt in a most delightful form in the prosecution of

original investigations. In a meeting like the present, we have the benefit of the
mutual suggestions, not of two, but of many persons, whose minds are directedto
the same object. The number of papers already in the hands of your Secretaries

shows that there will be no lack of matter in this" Section : the difficulty will rather,

I apprehend, be to get through the business before us in the time prescribed. On
this account the Section will, I hope, bear with me if I should sometimes feel my-

self compelled, in justice to the authors of papers which are placed later on our

lists, to cut short discussions which otherwise might have been further prolonged

with some interest.

--2 REPORT 18G2.

On Capillary Attraction. By the Eev. F. Bashforth, B.D .

   The theories of capillary action brought forward by Laplace, Young, and Poissou
lead to the same form of 'differential equation to the free surface of a drop of fluid.
During the last fifty years many attempts have been made to compare theory and
experiment, but the results arrived at seem to be quite unsatisfactory. The expe-
riments have generally been made by measuring the heights to which fluids rose
in capillary tubes. The smaller the diameter of the tube, the greater is the
efevation or depression of a fluid ; but at the same time it becomes more difficult

to secure a bore of a perfectly circular section and a surface perfectly clean. Laplace
attempted to test his theory by comparing the measured thickness of large drops of
mercury with their theoretical thickness obtained by an approximate solution of his

differential equation.

   After duly considering all the circumstances of the case, it appeared to the author

that the forms assumed by drops of fluid, of small or moderate size, afforded the

best means for testing the theory of capillary action. The drops of fluid may rest
on horizontal planes which they do not wet, or they may hang below horizontal

surfaces which they do wet. Extensive tables have been calculated, which give
the exact theoretical forms of all drops of fluid resting upon horizontal planes, as
mercury on glass, within the limits of size to which it seems desirable to restrict

experiments.

In order to determine the exact forms of drops of fluid, a microscope has been

mounted so that it can be moved horizontally or vertically by micrometer screws

provided with divided heads. In tin focus of the eyepiece are two parallel hori-

zontal and two parallel vertical lines, .orming by their intersections a small square

in the centre. The lines are purposely made rather thick in order that they may

be seen without difficulty, and before reading off the screw-head divisions, care

is taken to cause the image of the outline of the drop to pass through the middle

point of the square caused by the intersection of the cross lines. Thus the co-

ordinates are obtained of as many points as may be thought necessary, and after-

wards the form of a section of the drop, passing through the axis of its figure, may

be drawn by a scale of equal parts. By trial, a theoretical form must be fitted to

Whenthis experimental form, using the tables.  this is satisfactorily accomplished,

the value of Laplace's a is known, as well as the value of b, the radius of curvature

at the vertex : a determines the theoretical form of the drop, and b its size.

Only one or two satisfactory measurements have been made at present, but suffi-

cient has been done to show that such values may be assigned to the constants as

to secure a most exact agreement of the theoretical with the experimental form of

the free surface of a drop of fluid resting on a horizontal plane. It remains to be

seen whether a is constant for drops of all sizes of the same fluid at the same tem-

perature. If experiment be found to agree with theory, then the effect of a variation

of temperature upon a must be determined.

This method of proceeding affords the means of determining with great accuracy

the angle of contact, because the tables calculated from theory give the coordi-

nates for points, where the inclination of the tangent to the horizon is known, at

intervals of one degree, and parts of a degree can be calculated for by proportional

parts.

   If the experiments on mercury appear to confirm theory, it will be desirable to
complete the tables for the forms of pendent drops of fluid, because it will be very
difficult, if not impossible, to find supporting planes which such fluids as oils, water,
spirit of wine, &c. do not wet or adhere to. In such case it appears to be possible

to make use of pendent drops alone for the determination of a. When a has been

determined for each of two fluids, as spirit of wine and oil, it will be desirable to

examine the mutual action at their common surfaces, which may be done by

measuring the forms of drops of one fluid immersed in a bath of the other fluid con-
tained in a cell having parallel and transparent vertical sides and horizontal planes
at the top and bottom.

    Since the differential equations of Laplace and Poisson are the same in form, it
is evident that the above measurements for a single fluid cannot decide the difference
between them. It seems, however, manifest that the constitution of the surface

is very different from the interior of a fluid, But the thickness of this surface of

supposed variable density is so small as to be insensible. Since there is a certain
elastic force of vapour in contact with its fluid corresponding to every temperature,

may we not assume that the density of this indefinitely thin envelope may vary

from the density of the fluid inside to the density of the vapour outside ?

  On the Differential Equations of Dynamics. By Professor Boole, F.R.S.

   Referring to the reduction, by Hamilton and Jacobi, of the solution of the dyna-
mical equations to that of a single «o»-linear partial differential equation of the first
order, aud to that, by Jacobi, of the latter to the solution of certain systems of

--linear partial differential equations of the first order, the author showed, 1st, how,

from an integral of one equation of any such system, a common integral of all the
equations of the system could, when a certain condition dependent upon the pro-

perties of symmetrical gauche determinants is satisfied, be deduced by the solution
of a single ordinary differential equation of the first order susceptible of being made

iutegrable by means of a factor ; 2udly, how the common integral could be found
when this condition was not satisfied.

 On an Instrument for describing Geometrical Curves; invented by H. Johnston,
                 described and exhibited by the Rev. Dr. Booth, F.R.S.

    This instrument supplies a want which has been felt by architects and sculptors.

By its help, geometrical spirals of various orders may be described with as much
manual facility as a circle may be drawn on paper by a common compass.

        On a Certain Curve of the Fourth Order. By A. Caylet, F.R.S.

    The curve in question is the locus of the centres of the conies which pass

 through three given points and touch a given line ; if the equations of the sides of

=the triangle formed by the three points are x 0, y=0, s=0, these coordinates being
such that x+y+z=0 is the equation of the line infinity, and if ax+fy+yz=Ohe

the equation of the given line, then (as is known) the equation of the curve is

                  ^/ax(y+z-x)+*/Py(z+z-y)+^yz(x+y-z) = 0.

The special object of the communication was to exhibit the form of the curve in
 the case where the line cuts the triangle, and to point out the correspondence of the
positions of the centre upon the curve, and the point of contact on the given line.

  On the Representation of a Curve in Space by means of a Cone and Monoid

                            Surface. By A. Cayeey, F.R.S.

    The author gave a short account of his researches recently published in the
 'Comptes Ilendus.' The difficulty as to the representation of a curve in space
is, that such a curve is not in general the complete intersection of two surfaces
any two surfaces passing through the curve intersect not only in the curve itself,
but in a certain companion curve, which cannot be got rid of; this companion curve
is in the proposed mode of representation reduced to the simplest form, viz. that
of a system of lines passing through one and the same point. The two surfaces
employed for the representation of a curve of the wth order are, a cone of the nth order
having for its vertex an arbitrary point (say the point x=0, y=0, z=0), and a monoid
surface with the same vertex, viz. a surface the equation whereof is of the form

Qw -- P = 0, P aud Q being homogeneous functions of (x,y,z) of the degrees^ and
-- --p 1 respectively (where p is at most=« 1). The monoid surface contains upon
-- =it jj (p 1) lines given by the_equations (P 0, Q=0); and the cone passing through
--n(p 1) of these lines (if, as above supposed, _p ^> n-\, this implies that some of

these lines are multiple lines of the cone), the monoid surface will besides intersect

tho cone in a curve of the nth. order.

On the Curvature of the Margins of Leaves with reference to their Growth.
                                  ByW.Essox,M.A.

Leaves have a right and left margin on each side of their axis. These margins
                                                                                                          1*
4 REPORT 1862.

are of different lengths, but of the same shape. The length differs owing to circum-
stances of growth, such as the left margin being next the stem or next a leaflet,
forming with it a composite leaf. The curvature of the margin has been ascertained

in many instances to be that of the reciprocal spiral / »·=--). In some leaves

the pole of curvature lies on the axis, in others in the body of the leaf, and in others
entirely outside the leaf. If the leaflets of a composite leaf have this curvature,
their extreme points lie on a reciprocal spiral (e. g. the horse-chestnut leaf). It is
probable that more irregular leaves have margins which are merely modifications

r=--of the reciprocal spiral or other spirals, such as the Lituus (7=r I

   The growth of a margin may be represented by increments of an arc of the
spiral cut off by an increasing chord or radius vector. By this means may be

accurately determined the growth of a leaf under given circumstances of soil, tem-
perature, and moisture. It is only necessary to register the amount of angular

rotation of the radius vector of the spiral.

of double curvature, those lines will terminate on a second curve, from which we

can return to the first by a precisely similar process of construction.

   And instead of thus taking the reciprocal of a curve with respect to a sphere, we
may take it with respect to any surface of the second order, as is probably well

known to geometers, although the author was lately led to perceive it for himself

by the very simple analysis given above.

On a certain Class of Linear\Differential Equations,

                       By the Rev. Robert Harlet, F.B.A.S.

 --Theohem. From any algebraic equation of the degree n, whereof the coefficients

are functions of a variable, there may be derived a linear differential equation of the
order n -- 1, which will be satisfied by any one of the roots of the given algebraic equa-

tion. The differential equation so satisfied is called, with respect to the algebraic

equation, its " differential resolvent." The connexion of this theorem, which is due

to Mr. Cockle, with a certain general process for the solution of algebraic equations,

led the author to consider its application to the two following trinomial forms, viz.

  n  -ny+(n-l)x=0,                                                        (I.)

to either of which any equation of the nth. degree, when n is not greater than 5,
can, by the aid of equations of inferior degrees, be reduced. The several differential

=resolvents for the successive cases n 2, 3, 4, 5 were calculated ; and by induction

the general differential resolvents were formed. Following Professor Boole's

symbolical process and using the ordinary factorial notation, that is to say, repre-

       Every differential resolvent may be regarded under two distinct aspects. It may

     be considered either, first, as giving- in its complete integration the solution of the
     algebraic equation from which it has been derived ; or, secondly, as itself solvable
     by means of that equation. In the first aspect the author has considered the

     differential equation (A) in a paper entitled " On the Theory of the Transcendental

     Solution of Algebraic Equations," just published in the ' Quarterly Journal of Pure

     and Applied Mathematics,' No. 20. In the second aspect every differential resol-

     vent of an order higher than the second gives us, at least when the dexter of its
     defining equation vanishes, a new primary form, that is to say, a form not recognized
     as primary in Professor Boole's theory. And in certain cases in which the dexter

     does not vanish, a comparatively easy transformation will rid the equation of the

     dexter term, and the resulting differential equation will be of a new primary form.

               On the Volumes of Pedal Surfaces. By T. A. Hirst, F.R.S.

        The pedal surface being the locus of the feet of perpendiculars let fall from any
     point in space, the pedal origin, upon all the tangent planes of a given fixed primi-
     tive surface, will, of course, vary in form as well as in magnitude with the position
     of its origin. If, however, the volume of the pedal be considered as identical with
     that of the space swept by the perpendicular, as the tangent plane assumes all pos-

     --sible positions, a definition which will apply to unclosed as well as to closed
     -- --pedals, the following two general theorems may be enunciated: 1. Whatever

     may be the nature of the primitive surface, the origins of pedals of the same
     volume are, in general, situated on a surface of the third order. 2. The primitive

     surface being closed, but in other respects perfectly arbitrary, the origins of pedals
     of constant volume lie on a surface of the second order ; and the entire series of
     such surfaces constitutes a system of concentric, similar, and similarly-placed qua-

     drics, the common centre of all being the origin of the pedal of least volume.

     On the Exact Form and Motion of Waves at and near the Surface of Deep Water.

       By "William John Hacquorn Rankine, C.E., LL.D., F.B.SS. L. § E. Sfc.

        The following is a summary of the nature and results of a mathematical investi-
     gation, the details of which have been communicated to the Royal Society.

        The investigations of the Astronomer Royal and of Mr. Stokes on the question
     of straight-crested parallel waves in a liquid proceed by approximation, and are
     based on the supposition that the displacements of the particles are small compared
     with the length of a wave. Hence it has been legitimately inferred that the results
     of those investigations, when applied to waves in which the displacements are con-

     siderable as compared with the length of wave, are only approximate.

      --In the present paper the author proves that one of those results viz. that in very

     deep water the particles move with a uniform angular velocity in vertical circles
     whose radii diminish in geometrical progression with increased depth, and conse-

     quently that surfaces of equal pressure, including the upper surface, are trochoidal

     is an exact solution for all possible displacements, how great soever.

        The trochoidal fomi of waves was first explicitly described by Mr. Scott Russell
     but no demonstration of its exactly fulfilling the cinematical and dynamical condi-

     tions of the question has yet been published, so far as the author knows.

       AIn ' Manual of Applied Mechanics ' (first published in 1858), the author

     stated that the theory of rolling waves might be deduced from that of the positions
     assumed by the surface of a mass of water revolving in a vertical plane about a
Q REPORT 1862.

horizontal axis ; but as the theory of such waves was foreign to the subject of the

book, he deferred until now the publication of the investigation on which that

statement was founded.
   Having communicated some of the leading principles of that investigation to

Mr. William Froude in April 1862, the author was informed by that gentleman that
he had arrived independently at similar results by a similar process, although he had
not published them. The introduction of Proposition II. between Propositions I.
and III. is due to a suggestion by Mr. Froude.

   The following is a summary of the leading results demonstrated in the paper :

  --Proposition I. In a mass of gravitating liquid whose particles revolve uniformly

--in vertical circles, a wavy surface of trochoidal profile fulfils the conditions of uni-

formity of pressure, such trochoidal profile being generated by rolling, on the under
side of a horizontal straight line, a circle whose radius is equal to the height of a

--conical pendulum that revolves in the same period with the particles of liquid.
    Proposition II. Let another surface of uniform pressure be conceived to exist

indefinitely near to the first surface: then if the first surface is a surface of con-
tinuity (that is, a surface always traversing identical particles), so also is the second

--surface. (Those surfaces contain between them a continuous layer of liquid.)
    Corollary. The surfaces of uniform pressure are identical with surfaces of con-

--tinuity throughout the whole mass of liquid.
   Propositionlll. The profile of the lower surface of the layer referred to in Pro-

position II. is a trochoid generated by a rolling circle of the same radius with that

which generates the upper surface ; and the tracing-arm of the second frochoid is
shorter than that of the first trochoid by a quantity bearing the same proportion to

the depth of the centre of the second rolling circle below the centre of the first

rolling circle, which the tracing-arm of the first rolling circle bears to the radius of

--that circle.
   Corollaries. The profiles of the surfaces of uniform pressure and of continuity
form an indefinite series of trochoids, described by equal rolling circles, rolling with

equal speed below an indefinite series of horizontal straight lines.
   The tracing-arms of those circles (each of which arms is the radius of the circular

orbits of the particles contained in the trochoidal surface which it traces) diminish
in geometrical progression with a uniform increase of the vertical depth at which

the centre of the rolling circle is situated.

   The preceding propositions agree with the existing theory, except that they are

more comprehensive, being applicable to large as well as to small displacements.
   The following is new as an exact proposition, although partly anticipated by the

--approximative researches of Mr. Stokes :
   PropositionYs' The centres of the orbits of the particles in a given surface of equal
pressure stand at a higher level than the same particles do when the liquid is still,

by a height which is a third proportional to the diameter of the rolling circle and
the length of the tracing-arm (or radius of the orbits of the particles), and which is

--equal to the height due to the velocity of revolution of the particles.
   Corollaries. The mechanical energy of a wave is half actual and half potential

half being due to motion, and half to elevation.

The crests of the waves rise higher above the level of still water than their

hollows fall below it ; and the difference between the elevation of the crest and the
depression of the hollow is double of the quantity mentioned in Proposition II.

   The hydrostatic pressure at each individual particle during the wave-motion is

the same as if the liquid were still.
   In an Appendix to the paper is given the investigation of the problem, to find

approximately the amount of the pressure required to overcome the friction between

a trochoidal wave-surface and a wave-shaped solid in contact with it. The appli-

cation of the result of this investigation to the resistance of ships was explained

in a paper read to the British Association in 1861, and published in various

-- wengineering journals in October of that year. The following is the most conve-
nient of the formula3 arrived at : Let                                                                                                        be  the   heaviness   of the liquid                                           f the

      Some Account of Beccnt Discoveries made in the Calculus of Symbols.

                              By W. H. L. Russell, A.B.

   Before the publication of Professor Boole's memoir on a " General Method in

Analysis," which appeared in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1844, those

mathematicians who adopted the symbolical methods suggested by the researches

of Lagrange and Laplace, confined themselves to the use of commutative symbols,
and the science was consequently very limited in its applications. It received a
fresh impulse from the very remarkable memoir of Professor Boole mentioned above,
in which an algebra of non-commutative symbols was invented and applied to the
integration of a large class of linear differential equations. It occurred to the author
that the proper method of extending the calculus was to construct systems of
multiplication and division for functions of non-commutative symbols. This he

accordingly effected in his memoir published in the ' Philosophical Transactions
for 1861.° As the symbols are non-commutative, two distinct systems of multi-
plication and division, internal and external, arise for each class of symbols em-

ployed.

   Let p and n be two symbols combining according to the law

                                          /(«r).p"»=p»/ («+»»),

where/ (n) is any function of (n), then he gave, in the memoir alluded to, equa-

tions to determine the conditions that a symbolical function such as

                +&p-^OO+p"- 1 </>,,_! 00+Pn_2 4>,,-2<»+ *»                                     00

may be divisible internally and externally without a remainder by the symbolical

+function p^ x (n) yjr («), where

lie then gave some theorems for the transformation of certain functions of these

symbols, which lead to some very curious theorems in successive differentiation : he

has treated this part of the subject more fully in the ' Philosophical Magazine

for April 18C2. In a subsequent part of his paper in the ' Philosophical Transac-

tions,' he established binomial and multinomial theorems for these symbols, by

showing how to expand

(p 2 +p(9  (*))"  and  (p^+p*- 1     6       (7r)+pa_2   ft,(sr)+     .  .  .    n  in  terms  of  (p)  and  (tt).

At the end of the paper he gave some methods for solving differential equations

by a process analogous to the "Method of Divisors" in the theory of algebraical
equations. In his second memoir " On the Calculus of Symbols," published in
the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1862, he has shown how we may find the

highest common internal divisor of functions of non-commutative symbols, and

also how we may resolve them in all possible cases into two equal factors, a process
analogous to that for extracting the square root in common algebra. He then in-
vestigated the theory of multiplication in this calculus more generally. He gave a

rule  to  find  the  symbolical   coefficient       of    m    in  a  continued         product  of the  form

                                                         p

                     B, (tt)) (p        2    (tt))  (P      2

   After this he resumed the consideration of the binomial and multinomial theorems

explained in the former memoir. He gave the numerical calculation of the coeffi-

cients of the general term of the hinomial theorem, as explained in the first memoir.

In this the expansion was effected in terms of p and tt, but we may suppose the

expansion effected in terrns of (p) alone. In that case the coefficient of the general

term would be symbolical, and a function of (tt). He had calculated its value in the

memoir, and also the value of the corresponding general symbolical coefficient in

the multinomial theorem supposed expanded in powers of p alone. He concluded

+the paper by giving a method to expand the reciprocal binomial (tt 6 (p) drr)" in

terms of (tt). The general cases of division yet remained to be worked. This has

been effected by Mr. Spottiswoode in a very able and beautiful paper published in

the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1862. He has there given in full the division of

He has fully investigated the conditions that the divisor in each case may be an

internal or external factor of the dividend, and his results, which are expressed by

means of determinants, will be found extremely interesting. The author in conclu-

sion states that he believes the form in which the calculus now stands will be per-

manent, and that subsequent improvements will be very much based on extending

systems of multiplication and division to other symbolical expressions, in which

the laws of sjTnbolical combination axe different from those here assumed.

           On some'Models of Sections of Cubes. By C. M. "Willich.

   These were carefully-executed models, designed to illustrate certain simple pro-

positions in solid geometry relative to the volumes, &c. of solids formed by the
section of a cube by planes. The author wishes, at the same time, to place on
record the simple fraction \-|4, which gives an extremely close approximation to the
side of a square equal in area to a circle of which the diameter is unity.

            Some Cosmogonical Speculations. By Isaac Ashe, M.B.

   The author considered that the present planiform condition of the system dis-
proved the common view that it had formerly been a gaseous sphere, and proved
that it had originally been a liquid plane, as Saturn's rings are at present ; nor yet
in a heated condition, since he thought that, though capable of transformation,
heat coidd no more be absolutely lost than its equivalent, motion. The planets had,
doubtless, been originally molten ; but this heat the author ascribed to the collision
of particles, during their formation, from the liquid plane described. This formation
he ascribed to the development of a centre of attraction in the liquid plane, and
showed how, in a revolving plane, a diurnal rotation from west to east might hence
be originated, the particles so attracted acting as a mechanical "couple" of forces
on the planet during its formation. From the distance between the interior and
exterior planets, he inferred the former existence of two rings, as in the system of
Saturn, the asteroids being probably formed from small independent portions of

matter between these rings. He considered that the planets also first existed in-

dividually as planes, kasing this view on the uniformity of plane observed in the
              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                  U

orbits of the satellites. The satellites themselves he considered to have been

formed from portions of matter left behind during the contraction into a globe of
such a plane, which had at first occupied the whole space included within the pre-
sent orbits of the satellites. This view of the formation of the satellites he based
on the fact that the period of diurnal rotation in each of them corresponded with
the period of its revolution round its primary, which he showed would be the case

with any body whatever, if so left behind or lifted off a planet.
   The author then discussed the chemical changes that would ensue on the surface

of the earth after it had assumed the globular form. Oxidization of its metallic
constituents woidd absorb a vast proportion of its gaseous matter, and the forma-
tion of water woidd remove a great deal in addition. Hence the absence of atmo-
sphere or water on the moon's surface might be accounted for, as she would carry

off with her only ^th portion of the gaseous elements of the planet, and her sur-
face exposed to the chemical action of those elements woidd be much more than

Jgth that of the earth. Water also might be quite absorbed on her surface in the

formation of hydrates of the alkaline and earthy bases.

   On the earth, sodium would unite with chlorine, and common salt would result

and to the large amount of salt so formed the author ascribed the saltness of the
ocean ; rivers could only cany to the sea salt obtained from soil originally deposited
by the ocean, and which must therefore have derived its salt from the sea. This
process must be still going on, and hence Dr. Ashe inferred that the sea could never

have become salt, or be now increasing in saltness, from that cause ; hence he dis-

sented from that view, which was the one universally put forward by geologists.

On a Group of Lunar Craters imperfectly represented in Lunar Maps.

                         By W. R. Bikt, F.B.A.S.

   One of the objects of lunar maps should undoubtedly be such a representation of
the forms of the irregularities of the moon's surface, that a student may readily, at
the suitable epochs, ascertain the general outlines and configurations of the parts which

he is studying, so as to be certain that he has not misapprehended either the position

or form of any particidar portion of the lunar surface.

  A map constructed for a given epoch, at the full for instance, that shall give those

features by which every crater, mountain-chain, and plain may be instantly recog-

nized, is at the present moment a desideratum. Indeed, on such a map some craters

Awould not find place.  certain angle of illumination is necessary to biing out

saliently the distinguishing features of a crater or mountain-chain ; and a series of

maps that would exhibit each to the best advantage, must include as many distinct

epochs of illumination in their construction as there are meridians encircling the

lunar globe.

   One of the greatest monuments of the skill and industry characterizing astrono-
mical science is undoubtedly Beer and 3Iadler's large map of the Moon. To the
student of selenography it is invaluable ; his progress would be slow without it.

The writer of this paper cannot, however, agree with Crampton "that every
mountain and every valley, every promontory and every defile on the moon s
surface, finds its representative on that map." On the contrary, in his examination

of the lunar surface, he has met with several instances of features not recorded

thereon, a recent instance of which forms the subject of the present paper.

   In the neighbourhood of a fine chain of craters that come into sunlight from ten
to thirteen days of the moon's age, and are well seen under the evening illumi nation

Philolaus, Anaximenes, and Anaximander, with an unnamed crater between Anaxi-
menes and Anaximander, are three crater-form depressions, of which there are nume-

--rous examples on the moon's surface, the usual characteristics being, 1st, an

extensive floor, exhibiting a variety of surface in different specimens, often pierced

with small craters and diversified with hills ; 2nd, a more or less perfect rampart,
here and there pierced with craters, and rising into elevated peaks, so that the entire

depression is readily recognized as a distinct formation, completely separated from

its surrounding neighbours. Two such depressions, lying nearly in the same

meridian, and connected by a table-land or plateau, are very imperfectly, if at all,

represented bv the German selenographers. The sketch accompanying this com-

munication, taken at Hartwell, on Sept. 18, 1862, under the evening illumination,
exhibits the general characters of the northern depression, viz. a floor pierced by a

line of eruption (a common feature in several lunar forms), a nearly continuous

rampart on the east and west sides, rising into a considerable mountain mass at the

north angle marked B by Beer and Madler, pierced by the crater Horrebow, and

connected by the steep rocks that form the north boundary of the plateau. It is

proposed, in 'accordance with a suggestion by Dr. Lee, to designate this depression

« Herschel II."

   Beer and Madler thus describe the table-land :
   " South-easterly of Horrebow is a large plateau, fourteen German miles broad,

and from twenty to twenty-five German miles long, appearing less from foreshort-
ening. The western border stretches from the western corner of Horrebow to that

of Pythagoras, and is rather steep. An offshoot from the same stretches to Anaxi-

+Bmander. The southern boundary is denoted by the crater Horrebow ( 58° 9' Lat.,
/and --42° 0' hong. ), the northern boundary by two craters e and Pythagoras. It

rises on the east, in three great steep mountains of a very dark colour, straight up

to the plateau, and only faint traces extend from thence still further towards the east.

The most southerly of these three mountains is 019 toises high, while all three of the
mountains appear to be exactly similar to each other in height, form, and colour.

  --" The surface of the plateau itself has, besides several craters, among which

AHorrebow (+58° 40' Lat., and --45° 30' Long), 267 German miles in diameter, is

--the largest, deepest, and brightest, only a few scarcely perceptible ridges, and may

accordingly be considered as an actual level. But whether this landscape, containing

nearly 200 square German miles, is to be distinctly recognized as one connected

whole, depends very much upon illumination and libration."

   It is proposed to designate this table-land "Robinson," in honour of the

Astronomer of Armagh.

   The following description  of the same table-land is taken   from the author's
observations, dated London,   1862, March 12, 6h to 10" 30m G.  M. T., moon's age

Society's Sheepshanks telescope No. 5, aperture 2'75 inch.

" South of the crater or depression Herschel II. is another, well defined, but not

so large. Between the two is a table-land, in which at least five craters have been

opened up. Two are in a line with Horrebow ; both are given by Beer and Madler

--lation as /"Pythagoras ; Beer and Madler thus speak of it : " Through an oversight,

the lettering Pythagoras d occurs twice on our map ; once for a slightly depressed

crater on the edge of the previously-described plateau."]

" The table-land lies nearly in the direction of the meridian : the mountains on

the north slope, or rather their rugged and precipitous slopes, dip towards the large

crater Herschel II. ; while those on the south [the three dark mountains before

mentioned] dip towards the other and smaller crater, which it is proposed to

designate ' South.' On the west the table-land abuts on the border of the Mare

Prigoris, while on the east it extends to some mountain-ranges beyond Anaxi-

niander."

    [The reader will notice a discrepancy in the descriptions as regards the points
of the lunar horizon. It was thought better to leave each description as given
by the writers, rather than attempt a conversion of them; especially as future
observers can decide upon which they will adopt, consistent with the principles

of lunar topographv.]

   The form of the 'table-land before described is irregular. In the sketch it appears
to be confined to the area between Herschel II. and " South," and this is the most

conspicuous portion of it ; but on the night of the 31st of January, 1863, under the

morning illumination, it was seen to extend to the north of a crater then coining into

Asunlight eastward of " South," which it is proposed to designate "Babbage."

boundary of the table-land. Beer and Madler have left its boundaries undetermined,
and further observations are necessary to mark them out with precision.

omitted by Beer and Madler, forming the continuation of the rim from the steep

mountains F to the rim of Anaximander, where he gives a small crater shown in

the eye-sketch. On the other hand, Schroter has omitted the western rim extending

northwards from Horrebow, which is given by Beer and Madler. Horrebow is
clearly a part of Herschel II.

On the Augmentation of the Apparent Diameter of a Body by its Atmospheric
     Refraction. By the Rev. Professor Challis, M.A., F.H.S., F.B.A.S.

   For reasons given in another communication, it was assumed that atmospheres
generally have definite boundaries at which their densities have small but finite

values. Two cases of refraction were considered : in the one, the curvature of the

course of a ray through the atmosphere was assumed to be always less than that
of the globe it surrounds ; and in the other, the curvature of the' globe might be

the greater. The former is known to be the case with the earth's atmosphere and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

it was supposed that, a fortiori, this must be the case with respect to any atmo-
sphere the moon may be supposed to have. On this supposition it was shown that
the apparent diameter of the moon, as ascertained by measurement, would be greater
than that inferred from the observation of an occultation of a star, because, by reason
of the refraction of its atmosphere, the star would disappear and reappear when
the line of vision was within the moon's apparent boundary. The same result
would be obtained from a solar eclipse. It was stated that, by actual comparisons
of the two kinds of determinations, such an excess to the amount of from 6" to 8"

was found. This difference may reasonably be attributed to the existence of a lunar
atmosphere of very small magnitude and density. The author also stated that

from this result there would be reason to expect, in a solar eclipse, that a slender
band of the sun's disk immediately contiguous to the moon's border would be some-
what brighter than the other parts, and advised that especial attention should be
directed to this point on the next occurrence of a solar eclipse. The case in which
the curvature of the path of the ray is greater than that of' the globe was assumed
to be that of the sun s atmosphere ; and it was shown, on this supposition, that all
objects seen by rays which come from the sun's periphery are brought by the re-
fraction to the level of the boundary of the atmosphere, whether they proceeded
from objects on the surface of the interior globe, or from clouds supposed to be sus-
pended in the atmosphere. Accordingly, the contour of the sun should appear
quite continuous, and the augmentation of apparent semidiameter will be equal to
the angle subtended at the earth by the whole height of the atmosphere. The
apparent diameters of the planets wih, for like reasons, be augmented to a certain
amount by their atmospheric refractions ; and on account of the great distances of
these bodies from the earth, the eclipse of a satellite will take place as soon as the
visual ray is bent by the interposition of the atmosphere.

                     On the Zodiacal Light, and on Shooting-Stars.

             By the Eev. Professor Challis, M.A., F.IllS., F.E.A.S.

   The phenomena of the zodiacal light, as gathered from observations made both
in northern and in southern latitudes, were stated to be as follows. As seen in north
latitudes, it appears in the West after the departure of twilight, as a very faint light,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  13

stretching along the ecliptic, about 10° broad at its base in the horizon, and coming
to an apex at an altitude of from 40° to 50°. It is most perceptible in the West in
the months of February and March, at which time its apex is near the Pleiades.

Similar appearances are presented in the morning before sunrise in the East in the
months of August and September. The light seen in the autumn lies in the same
direction from the sun as that seen in the spring. In the southern hemisphere the

appearances are strictly analogous, but the times and positions of maximum visi-

bility are, the evenings in autumn in the West, and the mornings in spring in the
East. The portion best seen in the southern hemisphere lies in the opposite direction
from the sun to that which is best seen in the northern hemisphere. The portion
seen, and the degree of visibility, depend on the inclination to the horizon of the
part of the ecliptic along which the light]stretches. The greater the inclination
the better it is seen. At the December solstice opposite portions have been seen
in the northern hemisphere, one in the morning and the other in the evening ; and
in the southern hemisphere opposite portions have been similarly seen at the June
solstice. At these seasons the ecliptic is inclined at large and equal angles to the
horizon at equal intervals before sunrise and after sunset. The southern observa-
tions, from which these inferences are drawn, are those made by Professor Piazzi
Smyth at the Cape of Good Hope in the years 1843, 1844, and 1845, and published
in vol. xx. of the ' Edinburgh Transactions,' and evening observations in the autumn
of 1848, communicated by a friend of the author resident in the interior of Brazil.
More recently, in vol. iv. of the 'American Astronomical Journal ' were published

--observations by Mr. Jones, a chaplain of the United States Navy, who makes the

following statement : " When in latitude 23° 28' N., the sun being in the opposite

solstice, I saw the zodiacal light at both east and west horizon simultaneously from
eleven to one o'clock for several nights in succession." The ecliptic must at the

time have nearly passed through the zenith of the observer at midnight. It is
clear, therefore, that to be seen an hour before and after midnight, the zodiacal light

must have extended beyond the earth's orbit. Taking this as a necessary inference
from the observations, it follows that the earth is either always enveloped by the

zodiacal light, or at least when passing through the line of its nodes. Professor

 Challis considers this to be the explanation in part of the luminosity of the sky
which is generally perceptible on clear nights, and at some seasons in greater

degree than at others. I he American observer also states that he saw when at

Quito, " every night, aud all through the night, a luminous arch from east to west

quite across the sky, 20° wide, and most apparent when the ecliptic is vertical."

This light is distinguished from the zodiacal light by its being of uniform width.

   From the ensemble of the observations, the zodiacal light is of the form of a double

convex lens, with the sun in the centre, and the principal plane coinciding nearly

with that of the sun's equator. As it may be inferred from the foregoing statements
that it envelopes the earth, we may conclude that it is simply luminosity, without

 accompanying bodies. Professor Challis proposes, therefore, to account for it by
the effect which the rotation of the vast body of tbe sun produces on the lumini-
 ferous medium, this effect being rendered visible by the disturbance of the gyratory
motion by the motion of translation of the sun in space. In a similar manner,
 magnetic currents are rendered visible in the form of the aurora by the effect of
 transverse currents. This explanation he stated to be in accordance with the prin-
 ciples of the undulatory theory of light.

    The appearance of shooting-stars in the August and November periods was
 accounted for on like principles, by the disturbance given to the luminiferous medium
 by the curvilinear motion of the earth resulting from its proper motion and the
 motion of the solar system through space. At two epochs depending on the vari-
 ations of the rate of motion, and of the rate of deviation from rectilinear motion,
 the disturbances would be at a maximum, and these two epochs were assumed to
 correspond to Aug. 10 and Nov. 12. The kind of disturbance which the earth
 impresses by its curvilinear motion was supposed to be such as would produce
 eddies or whirls. Besides this, there might be a disturbance of terrestrial origin,
 analogous to that which produces the zodiacal light, which might account for the
 luminous arch noticed by the American observer.

   On some of the Characteristic Differences between tlie Configuration of the

      Surfaces of the Earth and Moon. By Professor HejtotEssy, F.R.S.

   The author pointed out that the peculiarities observed on the surface of our
satellite should be ascribed to the sole action of volcanic forces, whereas those which

we find on the earth result from a combination of volcanic and atmospherical

agencies. In order more perfectly to study these contrasts, he called attention to
the most characteristic feature of all lunar volcanos, namely the ring- or hoop-shaped

crater, surrounded by circular, nearly concentric ridges. On the earth's surface,

volcanos deviated more or less from this type ; and if the deviations are due to the
differences between terrestrial and lunar superficial forces, it must follow that such

differences will be most distinctly manifested in those cases where such terrestrial

forces possess the highest degree of energy. He illustrated this proposition by re-

ferring to the peculiar structure of the volcanos in the island of Java, where the

action of tropical rains and hurricanes has been effective in producing the widest
differences between the terrestrial volcanic summits and those observed on the

moon's surface. While the hooped structure of the latter cannot be traced among
the views of Javanese volcanos which are presented iu the comprehensive work
published by Dr. Junghuhn, we frequently find diagrams of volcanic cones show-

ing radiating ribs like those of a folded lamp-shade or an umbrella half closed, an
appearance due to the very regular manner in which the tropical torrents scoop out
the friable and scoriaceous summits of the craters. The contrast which arises by
comparing some of these drawings with the best lunar diagrams and photographs

may prove highly interesting to geologists as well as to selenographers.

MOn aBrilliant Elliptic Ring in thePlanetary Nebula, 20° 5&,N.P.D. 101° 5G'.

         By William Lassell, F.R.S. ; in a Letter to Dr. Lee, F.R.S.

                                       9 Piazza Sliema, Malta, 26th Sept. 1862.

My --dear Sin, In directing my large equatorial upon the well-known plane-
Mtary nebida situated in
                             20 h 5(3'», N.P.D. 101° 50' (1862), it has revealed so

marvellous a conformation that I cannot forbear to send you a drawing of it, with

some description of its appearance. With comparatively low powers, e. g. 231 and

285, it appears at first sight a3 a vividly light-blue elliptic nebula, with a slight

prolongation of the nebula, or a very faint star at or near the ends of the transverse

axis. In this aspect the nebula resembles in form the planet Saturn when the ring

is seen nearly edgewise. Attentively viewing it with higher powers, magnifying

respectively 760, 1060 and 1480 times, and under the most favourable circumstances

which have presented themselves, I have discovered within the nebula a brilliant

elliptic ring, extn niely well defined, and apparently having no connexion with the

surroundin"- nebula ; which indeed has the appearance of a gaseous or gauze-like

envelope, scarcely interfering with the sharpness of the ring, and only diminishing

somewhat its brightness. This nebulous envelope extends a little further from the

ends of the conjugate than from the ends of the transverse axis; indeed it is but

verv faintly prolonged, and only just traceable towards the preceding and fol-

io win o- stars. There is a star near its border northwards, in the projection of the

conjugate axis.

The breadth or thickness of the ring is, unlike that of Saturn, nearly uniform or equal

in every part, so that its form most probably is either really elliptic, and seen by us

in a line nearly perpendicular to its plane ; or if really circular and seen foreshortened,

a section through any part of it limited by the internal and external diameters must

be a circle. In other words,-it will be like a circular cylinder bent round. It coidd

myscarcely fail to bring to  mind the annular nebida in Lyra, especially as there is

a conspicuous central star (proportionally, however, much brighter than that which

is in the centre of that nebida ) ; and yet the resemblance is only rudely in form ; for

this ring is much more symmetrical and more sharply defined, suggesting the idea

of a solid galaxy of brilliant stars.

The ring is not perfectly uniform in brightness, the south-preceding part being

slightly the most vivid. The transverse axis is inclined to the parallel of declina-

Ation about 13°,  series of luicvonietrical measures of the length and breadth of

The object is, as may be supposed, one of extreme difficulty, requiring in the

--hio-liest degree the combination of light and definition in the telescope, and a fa-

not until I was favoured with an uuusually fine night, and had applied a power of

1480, that the whole of the details were brought out.

I confess I have been greatly impressed by the revelation of this most wonderful

object, situated on what perhaps we may consider as the very confines of the acces-

sible or recognizable part of the universe, affording ground for the inference^ that

more °-orgeous systems exist beyond our view than any we have become acquainted

                       Observed R.A. and N.P.D. of Comet II. 1862.

                         By the Eev. E. Main, M.A., F.R.S.

   This paper gave the results of observations of the comet from August 5 to August
29, on ten nights. It was observed on the meridian with the Carrington transit-
circle on August 7 and 9, and off the meridian with the heliometer, used as an or-
dinary equatorial, on August 5, 7, 9, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, and 29. The observations
have 'been rigorously reduced, and all necessary corrections for refraction, parallax,
&c. have been applied. The assumed mean places of the companion stars for 1862,
January 1, taken mainly from the ' Radclift'e Catalogue of Circumpolar Stars," were

also given.

                       On the Dimensions and Ellipticity of Mars.

                          By the Eev. E. Main, M.A., F'.R.S.

   This paper gave the results of seven sets of measures of the disk of Mars, made
for the determination of his ellipticity with the heliometer, by the method of contact
of limbs of the two images formed by the half-object-glasses. The power used was
300, which is found by experience to be very suitable for such measures. The
direction of the polar diameter was determined' by a well-defined circular white cap
near the southern limb, the centre of which was assumed to be coincident with the
South Pole. The directions, separately estimated, of the polar and equatorial
diameters agreed well on separate evenings, their difference never deviating much
from 90°, thus proving the precision of the estimations. The measured diameters

have been corrected for defect of illumination.

   The following are the results of the measures :

prisingly -well from night to night, while the former exhibit discordances of consider-
able amount. This it is difficult to account for, except on the supposition that the

snowy cap before referred to may have had some influence in distracting the eye

from the real borders of the images in making the contacts. Still, on the whole, the
measures all agree in establishing a measurable ellipticity, and Mr. Main intended to
continue them at every opportunity during the present opposition, with the utmost
care and caution.

          On some Peculiar Features in the Structure of the Sun's Surface.

                                      By J. Nasmtth.

   The author gave a short sketch of the character of the sun's surface as at pre-

sent known. He described the spots as gaps or holes, more or less extensive, in the

luminous surface or photosphere of the sun. These exposed the totally dark nucleus

--of the sun ; over this appears the mist surface a thin, gauze-like veil spread over

it. Then came the penumbra! stratum, and, over all, the luminous stratum, which
he had discovered was composed of a multitude of very elongated, lenticular-shaped,
or, to use a familiar illustration, willow-leaf-shaped masses, crowded over the plio-
tosphere, and crossing one another in every possible direction. The author had pre-
pared and exhibited a diagram, pasting such elongated slips of white paper over a

sheet of black card, crossing one another in every possible direction in such multi-
tudes as to hide the dark nucleus everywhere, except at the spots. These elongated
lens-shaped objects he found to be in constant motion relatively to one another ; they

sometimes approached, sometimes receded ; and sometimes they assumed a new an-
gular position, by one end either maintaining a fixed distance or approaching its

neighbour, while at the other end they retired from each other. These objects,
some of which were as large in superficial area as all Europe, and some even as the
surface of the whole earth, were found to shoot in thin streams across the spots,
bridging them over in well-defined streams or comparative lines, as exhibited on
the diagram ; sometimes by crowding in on the edges of the spot they closed it in,
and frequently, at length, thus obliterated it. These objects were of various di-
mensions, but in length they generall)r were from 90 to 100 times as long as their
breadth at the middle or widest part.

pical regions of the earth where tornadoes and cyclones occur, and those of Wilson
in the last century. Thefacitke are clearly shown, and seem to prove that the tro-
pical regions of the sun are highly agitated, and that immense waves of luminous
matter are thrown up, between which appear the dark cavities of the spots, whose
sloping sides form the penumbrse, as explained by Wilson and others. Other ana-
logies between solar spots and earthly storms were pointed out, and reference was
made to the glimpses of the structure of the sun exhibited by Mr. Nasnryth as
confirming the above views.

On the Hindu Method of Calculating Eclipses. By W. Spottiswoode, F.R.S.

The astronomy of the Hindus is contained in a series of works known by the

general name of " Siddhanta." These have been composed at different times over

a period of 2000 years. In them are some incidental allusions to the configurations

of the heavenly bodies, by means of which Baily, Davis, and others have attempted

to calculate the dates of some of the works. There were two points to which the

author drew particular attention, viz. the process of correction whereby the true

longitudes were deduced from the mean, and the precession of the equinoxes. It

had been noticed that the apsides, or points of slowe? t movement, and the positions

of conjunction with the sun had proper motions. These were attributed to

influences residing in the apsides and conjunctio ^s respectively, and corrections

due to each were accordingly devised. The undisturbed orbit was considered a

circle, with the earth (E) in the centre, and upon it the centre of a smaller circle or

epicycle moved with a uniform angular velocity equal, but opposite in direction,

M mto that of the ur disturbed planet; so that being the centre, ard any given

point on the epicycle, M»i always remained parallel to itself, if, then, at the apse

or conjunction (according as the correction of one or the other was being calcu-
Mmlated)
          was in a straight line with EM, the true position of the planet was

Emconceived to be at the point where  cut the undisturbed orbit. The radius,

moreover, of the epicycle was variable, and its magnitudes at the odd and even

quadrants being determined so as to satisfy observation, its intermediate variation

was considered proportional to the sine of the mean anomaly. The precession of
the equinoxes is an important element in Hindu astronomy, not only as a question
of scientific accuracy, but also as marking an epoch in the history of discovery. It

is an ascertained fact that their earlier writers, among the foremost of whom

Brahmagupta may be mentioned, took no account of it whatever. The statement
in the Surya Siddhanta, when divested of its obscure terminology, seems to amount

to this, that the sidereal circle shifts on the zodiac with an oscillating motion,

whose period is 7200 years, and whose maximum range is 27°. This gives an

annual rate of 54".

On the Means of following the Small Divisions of the Scale regulating the
  Distances and Enlargement in the Solar Camera. By A. Clattdet, F.R.S.

   The author, in a former paper, had proposed a new method for measuring both

the distances of the negative and screen for any degree of enlargement of the image,
by means of a scale or unity divided into 100 parts, and smaller fractions if possible.
This scale being fixed on the table of the optical apparatus, an index connected with
the frame holding the negative was brought exactly on any division of the scale
which was indicating the proportion and distance of the image. This arrangement
woidd be very complete and satisfactory if the scale were always long enough to be
marked with divisions sufficiently conspicuous ; but the shorter the focus of the
object-glass, the smaller the divisions of the scale must be. In order to meet this

--difficulty, he has adopted the following plan : He traces on the table an equilateral
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  19

.triangle, the base of which is the exact length of the scale. Taking 8 inches, for
example, as that length, the three sides of the triangle will be 8 inches. Now, it
is possible to enlarge the base three, four, five, or any number of times, by extending
the sides of the triangle in the same ratio ; so that if it be desirable to enlarge the
scale four times, a triangle is formed having its base four times longer, viz. equal to

32 inches ; and dividing this new base into 100 parts, it is evident that each divi-
sion will be four times larger than it could have been on the original base. Now,
describing an arc, the chord of which is the base of the triangle, and attaching to
the summit a thin metallic wire, the other end of which can slide on the arc, it is
evident that each division of the magnified scale which may be covered by the wire

will correspond exactly with an equal division of the original scale, so thac, after
having brought the metallic wire on the division of the increased scale indicating
the size of the required image, and the wire being fixed on the index, it will be

brought exactly on any division of the unity of measure, however small it may be.

The author has described another plan to obtain the same result, and, perhaps, more
effectively : it consists in fixing the negative on a rack exactly the length of the
scale, which, acting on a pinion adapted to a sufficiently large wheel containing the
requisite divisions, will produce an entire revolution of the wheel ; and an index
being fixed on the table, will indicate on the wheel the exact amount of the course
effected by the negative on the scale ; and by turning the wheel to the division
required, this will bring the negative with the greatest accuracy to the distance
corresponding with the division. This system of focusing all camera-lenses might
be very advantageous in photographic operations, and would be less subject to errors
than the usual way of focusing on the ground glass.

Relation, entire let Phenomenes de la Polarisation Rotatoire, et les Formes

   Hemi'cdres ou Hemimorphes des Cristaux a un ou d deux Axes Optiqites.

   Par A. Des Gloizeaux.

   Tout le monde sait que la dtScouverte de la polarisation de la luniiere a rendu
possible 1'institution de nombreuses recherches, inabordables a tout autre mode

d'observation, sur la constitution moleculaire des corps solides et liquides. Je
n'entreprendrai pas ici de passer en revue les faits interessants et les lois remarqua-
bles dont on doit la connaissance aux travaux des Malus, des Fresnel, des Herschel,
des Arago, des Brewster, des Biot, &c. Je m'occuperai seulement de la polarisation
rotatoire et des relations que ce phenomene peut avoir avec la structure physique
des corps cristallises. Depuis que la science a ete dotee des microscopes polarisants
d'Amici et de Norrenberg, on a pu etendre les observations optiques a un grand
nombre de substances trop peu transparentes ou de trop petites dimensions pour se
prefer a, l'emploi des instruments generalement usites j usque dans ces demieres

annees. Le quartz est reste pendant tres longtemps le seul corps solide dans lequel
on eut constate l'existence du pouvoir rotatoire, et Sir John Herschel a le premier fait
remarquer qu'il paraissait y avoir une relation constante entre le sens de la rotation

des cristaux et le sens suivant lequel s'enroule la spirale fonne'e par plusieurs des

faces connues sous les noms de faces plagiedres et par la face rhombe, lorsque l'axe
principal des cristaux est place verticalement devant l'observateur. Ce rapproche-
ment a conduit a regarder le phenomene de la polarisation rotatoire comnie du a un

arrangement particulier des molecules physiques qui se manifesterait quelquefois

par des formes cristallines presentant l'hemiedrie dite plagiedre ou tournante. On

sait que le caractere de cette hemiedrie est la non-superposition des solides syme-
triques resultant de la reunion des faces plagiedres situees a droite et a gauche d'une

meme face prismatique du quartz. L' observation prouve d'ailleurs qu'elle peut

s'allier avec l'he'miedrie qui fournit pour la face rhombe deux solides inverses mais
superposables. II est en effet probable que c'est une structure de ce genre qui donne
iuix cristaux dextrof/i/res et aux cristaux Uvogyres la propriete d'impiimer a la lumiere
polarisee des modifications de sens contraire; car on n'a jamais observe de phe-
nomenes rotatoires dans les cristaux d'apatite, de Scheelite, d'erythroglucine, Sec,
sur lesquels on ne connait jusqu'a present que des formes hemiedres superposables.
Malheureusement la dissymetrie interieure n'est pas toujours accusee par des signes
exterieurs, et l'observation seule indique si un corps cristallise possede ou ne possede

                                                                                                       2*

pas la polarisation rotatoire. Ainsi, un grand nombre de cristaux de quartz ne por-»
tent aucune face plagiedre ; le chlorate de soude, dans les cristaux duquel M. Mar-
bach a decouvert le pouvoir rotatoire, s'obtient tantot en cubes parfaits, tantot en
tetraedres simples ou en tetraedres modifies paries faces d'un dodecaedre pentagonal
qui occupent relativement a celles du tetraedre deux positions inverses l'une de
1 autre en rapport avec le sens de la rotation; le cinabre rhomboedrique et le sulfate
de strychnine quadratique, qui, d'apres mes observations, impriment aussi au plan
de polarisation une deviation egale, pour le premier a 16 fois et pour le second a la
moitie de celle que produit le quartz, n'ont otfert jusqu'ici aucune trace d'heiniedrie ;

cependant j'ai trouve dans le cinabre des cristaux dextrogyres, des cristaux levogyres,
et des cristaux complexes ou l'emploi de la lumiere polarises convergente manifeste

les spirales d'Airy absoliunent comme dans le quartz. La cause qui donne naissance

a la polarisation rotatoire dans les cristaux parait done independante de celle qui

produit les formes hemiedriques ; seulement, comme l'a fait voir M. Marbach, la

production de ces formes peut etre favorisee artificiellement en faisant varier les
conditions dans lesquelles s'opere la cristallisation. II est done probable que les
cristaux de quartz a faces plagiedres n'ont pas pris naissance dans les menies cir-
constances que ceux ou les faces plagiedres manquent ; tous les cristaux de cinabre
connus jusqu'a ce jour ont du au contraire se former sous l'influence de phenomenes

geologiques semblables.

   Depuis que M. Biot a decouvert la deviation imprimee au plan de polarisation par
certains liquides et certaines dissolutions, on s'est souvent demande si les dissolu-
tions actives susceptibles de cristalliser produisaient necessairement des cristaux
doues du pouvoir rotatoire. La plus grande partie des substances actives en disso-
lution cristallisant sous des formes qui possedent deux axes optiques, la question est
longtemps restee sans reponse experimeutale. Mais les travaux de M. Marbach et
les miens, en revelant l'existence des trois seuls cas realisables dans les cristaux
depourvus de la double refraction ou dans les cristaux a un seul axe optique, sem-
blent prouver que les deux genres de phenomenes sont independants l'un de l'autre.

   En effet, 1°, le chlorate de soude, inactif en dissolution dans l'eau, jouit du pou-

voir rotatoire lorsqu'il est en cristaux ; le quartz fondu ou a l'etat de silice soluble

et le quartz cristallise" presentent les memes differences.
   2°. Le sulfate de strychnine quadratique a 13 equivalents d'eau, en dissolution

comme en cristaux, devie a gauche le plan de polarisation, seulement le pouvoir ro-

tatoire des cristaux est environ 30 fois plus grand que celui de la dissolution.
   3°. Le camphre ordinaire des laurine'es, actif en dissolution et a l'etat fondu,

donne par sublimation des cristaux appartenant au systems hexagonal, dans lesquels

on ne peut constater aucivne deviation du plan de polarisation, meme sous une

£paisseur de plusieurs millimetres.
    Les cristaux a deux axes optiques, dont la dissolution possede le pouvoir rota-

toire, sont assez nombreux ; on a done pu»les soumettre a des experiences variees.
D'apres les recherches de M. Pasteur, l'existence du pouvoir rotatoire dans une dis-
solution serait le plus souvent (a l'exception des sulfamylates) accompagnee par
l'hemiedrie non superposable ou rhemimorphie d'une ou de deux des formes sim-
ples que presentent les cristaux dissous. Cette hemie'drie se montre d'ailleurs
quelquefois sur les cristaux formes naturellement au sein d'une dissolution dans
l'eau pure, d'autres fois elle doit etre provoqu^e, soit en faisant varier la nature du
dissolvant, soit en blessant les cristaux et les replacant dans leur eau-mere*. S'il
existe, comme pour l'acide tarrrique, les tartrates et quelques autres substances
d'origine organique, deux dissolutions, l'une levogyre et l'autre dextrogt/re, les formes
hemiedres ou hemimorphes correspondantes produisent ordinairement (le sel de
seignette potassique parait seid faire exception) deux solides symetriques mais non
superposables. La rtSciproque n'est pas vraie dans tous les cas, puisque le sulfate
de magnesie et le formiate de strontiane, dont les cristaux offrent l'h(5mi^drie non
 superposable, foumis3ent des dissolutions inactives. Les causes qui produisent les
 formes cristallines hemiedres paraissent done agir d'une maniere plus generale que
 celle a laquelle est du le pouvoir rotatoire moleculaire.

On the Cohesion of Gases, and its relations to Carnot's Function and to recent

   Experiments on the TJiermal effects of Elastic Fluids in Motion. By James

    Ceoll, Glasgow.

   From the fact that those gases which are most easily liquefied by compression are
those which are found to deviate most from the law of Mariotte, we are led to the

conclusion that their deviations from this law are due to the mutual attraction of
their particles. Deviations from Mariotte's law after the manner of carbonic acid
follow as necessary consequences from cohesion. Other phenomena are also ex-

plainable on the same principle ; such, for instance, as why the coefficient of expan-

--sion is greatest for the gases which deviate most from Mariotte's law why the
--coefficient of expansion increases with the density in gases which deviate from

this law why, when equal weights are employed to compress different gases under

--the same conditions, the greatest amount of work is performed on the gas which

deviates most why, in the expansion of gases by heat, least work is performed by

heating the gases which present the greatest deviation.

The influence of Cohesion in relation to the Experiments of Prof. W. Thomson and

                Dr. Joule on the Thermal effects of Elastic Fluids in Motion.

In these experiments, air, carbonic acid, or hydrogen, under very high pressure,

was made to expand by forcing itself through a porous plug, and it was foimd that

the temperature of the gas after expansion was somewhat less than before it ; in

other terms, the heat of friction was found to fall short of compensating the cold

of expansion. The expenditure of elastic force experienced by the gas, in forcing

itself through the porous plug, tends in the first instance to lower its temperature

but as this force is spent in friction, the heat produced from friction ought exactly

to compensate the cold of expansion. This is only the case, however, when all the

force of expansion has been spent in friction ; if a portion of this force be consmned

in producing some other effect than heat, then the heat of friction will not com-

pensate the cold produced by the waste of force in expansion, and a cooling effect

Nowwill be the result.  it is perfectly evident that if the atoms of a gas when

compressed attract each other, the force of expansion cannot be all converted into

heat, a portion of it must be consumed in overcoming attraction, hence the heat of

friction will fall short of compensating the cold of expansion by an amount equal

to the equivalent of the work against attraction.

   It is generally understood that in certain cases a heating instead of a cooling

effect may take place. How this may occur is not so apparent. Prof. W. Thomson

states, that when the temperature of air rises above a certain height, the heat of

friction will exceed the cold of expansion, because P'V, the work which a pound

of air must do in expanding through the plug, is rather less than P V, which is the

work done on it in pushing it through the spiral up to the plug. It is by no means

obvious how this can result in a heating effect. That which produces the cold of

expansion is the expenditure of the elastic force in expanding through the plug

but as this force is not consumed on external work, but entirely spent in friction on

the particles of the air itself, the force which it loses on the one hand is entirely

restored to it on the other. But more force cannot be restored than was lost ; for

the force restored is just what was lost.

The only way whereby it is possible to account for a heating effect, is by supposing

that a gas which exhibits the heating effect possesses a certain amount of elasticity

independent of heat, and that the expenditure of this force in the production of heat

--by friction, is an expenditure of elastic force, but not an expenditure of heat

conclusion which is very improbable.

                    The Influence of Cohesion in relation to Carnot's Function,

  The following was suggested by Dr. Joule, in a letter to Prof. W. Thomson in

1848, as the true expression of Carnot's function,

                                             E

                                                                      T

ture in Centigrade degrees, measured from the temperature of melting ice.

Prof. W, Thomson has been led, from calculations based upon Regnault's observa-

tions on the pressure and latent heat of steam, to the conclusion that /* cannot in
all cases be expressed by the above formula.

  May not the deviations, however, be entirely due to the influence of cohesion ?

It is evident that cohesion must affect the value of this function in the following
manner : if a mutual attraction exist between the particles of a gas at a given
temperature, then that gas in cooling itself down one degree below that tempera-
ture, by performing mechanical work in expanding, will execute less work than it
would otherwise do did no cohesion between the particles exist ; for a portion of the
heat must be consumed in work against the cohesion. The quantity consumed by
cohesion will continually increase as the temperature diminishes ; for as the tem-
perature diminishes the cohesion increases. But in regard to steam and all other
saturated vapours, the reverse holds true, for the cohesion of the particles of vapours
increases as their temperature rises, because their density increases with rise of tem-
perature. In the case of a perfect gas, the function will agree with the formula at
all temperatures ; but in imperfect gases and vapours the function will deviate from
the formula, but in opposite directions. In both cases the actual function will fall

short of the theoretical.

    On the Supernumerary Bows in the Rainbow. By the Eev. J. Dingle.

   The author gave a method of approximating to the size of the drops of rain
corresponding to any given position of the supernumerary bows produced by the in-
terference of the two luminiferous surfaces proceeding from each drop. It appeared
from his tables appended to the paper that the size which Dr. Young (without
giving his method of calculation ) had assigned to the drops under certain conditions
was within j-pVoth of an inch of the truth, and was more accurate than that assigned
subsequently by Mr. Potter.

               On the Duration of Fluorescence. By Dr. Esselbach.

   The author described the apparatus by which he succeeded in 1856 in proving
the duration of fluorescence (¥ ,,V^ second with uranium glass), thereby establishing
a year before M. Becquerel the experimental link between this interesting pheno-
menon and phosphorescence.

Description of an Optical Instrument ivhich indicates the Relative Change of
   Position of Two Objects (such as ShijJS at Sea during Night) ivhich arc

    This instrument consisted of a lantern-shaped case, containing a lens in front
and a co icentric sheet of bent glass behind, at the focal distance of the lens, ruled

with parallel vertical lines. This was hung up on gimbals so as to have its axis
parallel to the course of the vessel, and the blight spot (the image of the light of the
approaching vessel) showed by its position and shirting the relative place and course

of the approaching vessel.

Experiments on Photography with Colour. By the Eev. J. B. Eeade, F.R.S.

  A recent examination of the phenomena of polarized light in their immediate

connexion with the undulatory theory led the author to inquire into the causes of
natural colours, and thence to the possibility of coloured objects setting up, in sen-
sitive films on which their image is thrown, the veiy same causes which regulate aud

determin e their own respective colours. This being effected, the image of an object

would commimicate to the eye the identical colour of the object itself.

  --The propositions, in general terms, are that radiant-coloured light consists in un-
--dulations of the lu mi niferous ether that all material bodies have an attraction for

the ethereal medium, by means of which it is accumulated within their substance

Eunit, divided by the absolute temperature. The reciprocal of must be the absolute tem-

 perature of melting ice, or the formula is erroneous.

and exerts its influence beyond them--and that the luminous phenomena are exhi-

bited under two modifications, the vibratory or permanent, and the undulatory or

transient state. This theory leads to the conclusion that the undulations within the
substance of material bodies communicate their vibrations to the ethereal medium

without them, and thence to the same medium within the eye. If the undulations
be such as to produce red, red is seen by the eye, and so for other colours. Now,

as we have films eminently sensitive to the action of reflected light, and capable

occasionally of being coloured bv such light, it is clearly within the laws of physical
science to suppose that the several portions of the excited film may retain within

themselves, in the vibratory and permanent state, the varying undulations of the
Acoloured objects whose images they receive.
                                              picture with the colours as in

nature would be the result, instead of the mere black and white mezzotmt at
present obtained. The desiderata are--a sensitive silver compound capable ot

receiving and transmitting the undulations, and energetic reflexions from the

objects themselves.

  mShortly before the meeting he happened to obtain unusual traces ot colour

photographic portraits. The chief difl'erence in manipulation was a slight excess of

the ioaizer in the collodion, and the addition of acetic acid and acetate of soda to

the bath. And in order more fully to test the effect of the cadmium and bromo-

iodizers, he increased the quantity until natural colours ceased to be strengthened.

The final proportion of iodizing solutions gave the portrait which was exhibited.
The general warm colours of the forehead and face, and the tone of the coat were

fairly represented in the portrait.

            Remarhs on the Complementary Spectrum. By J. Smith.

   The author endeavoured to explain, on the principle adopted by him in his chro-
raatrope experiments, the well-known fact that the spectrum of a hole in the win-
dow-shutter, when received on a screen, has the violet end above and the red below,
but when looked at through the prism, the red appears above and the violet below.

                  On the Motion of Camphor, SfC. towards the Light.

                  By Chakles Tomlinson, King's College, London.

   Books on chemistry from the time of Chaptal (1788) to the present, recognize
the fact that salts in crystallizing move towards the light ; that camphor, water,

alcohol, &c. form deposits on the most illuminated side of the bottles that contain
them. The history of the subject includes the names of Petit, Chaptal, Dorthes,
Draper, &c. Chaptal's experiments were made with saline solutions, and he found
that crystalline deposits could be determined to any point by admitting the light to

that point, or prevented bv shutting out the light. Dr. Draper, who named these
phenomena perihelion motions, found that in the case of camphor deposits were
sometimes made nearest the sun, and at other times furthest from him, the latter

being termed aphelion motions ; that reflected light and coloured light produced
aphelion movements ; that the deposits are not produced in the dark, or by artificial

light, and that rings and disks of tinfoil prevent the formation of deposits. He

supposed electricity to be concerned in the production of these phenomena.
   Mr. Tomlinson shows that neither light nor electricity has anything to do with

these effects, but that they are the simple results of cooling. By treating the

vapour of camphor, &c. as dew, all the effects follow ; and Chaptal's results are
obtained in full sunshine without any shutting out of the light, but simply by

preventing radiation by means of transparent screens. When a bottle containing

camphor, &c. is exposed to light, the illuminated side is generally the colder, and

hence the deposit on this side ; but when the sun is shining on the bottle, the
furthest side is the colder, and there the deposit takes place. Bottles of camphor
kept in the dark, *'. e. in a cupboard or drawer, are equally warm all round, and
hence no deposit is formed; but if such a bottle be cooled on one side by means of

a piece of filtering-paper dipped in ether, a deposit is instantly formed. If a bottle
of camphor be plunged into water at 100° no deposit is formed, because it is equally

hot all round. If a number of bottles be covered with opake substances and

exposed to the sun, or to a heated cannon-ball, deposits are formed or not according

as the screens absorb or reflect beat : a screen of tinfoil will not allow a deposit to

be formed ; but if tbe screen be of brown paper, there will be an abundant furthest
deposit. So also if a bottle have attached to it disks and rings of tinfoil, paper of
various colours, Sec, no deposit will be formed in and about such disks, because

Athey keep the bottle warm by preventing radiation, and even by absorbing heat.

disk of black paper put on a deposit already formed will clear away a much larger

space than tinfoil will do.

   The author found that crude camphor was more sensitive in its action than
refined ; but that the experiments succeed with ordinary camphor, Borneo cam-

phor, artificial turpentine camphor, camphoric acid, iodine, naphthaline, chloral,
water, alcohol, ether, &c.

On the Mechanical Power of Electro-Magnetism, with special reference to the
      Theory of Dr. Joule and Dr. Scoresby. By James Ceoll, Glasgow.

   In an article by Dr. Joule and Dr. Scoresby on the mechanical power of Electro-
magnetism*, it is stated that when the electro-magnetic engine is set in motion and

the current in consequence reduced from a to b, the heat manifested in the circuit

is reduced from a2 to b2, but the heat which is produced by the oxidation of the zinc

is  only reduced  from a to b                                                       hence they conclude  that  the  quantity of  heat equal
                                                                                 ;

a -- b produced by the zinc plates, but which does not appear in the circuit, is con-

sumed in the production of mechanical effects. That this conclusion is not satis-

factory will appear, the author thinks, from the following considerations, viz. if we
reduce the current from a to b by merely reducing the consumption of the zinc from

a, to b, the heat evolved in the circuit will in this case also be reduced from a2 to b2.

The question now arises, what becomes of the amount of foice a -- b which disap-

pears in the circuit here also ? It is not consumed in work, for no mechanical effect

takes place. Hence, from the disappearance of heat when the electro-magnetic
machine is set in motion, we are not warranted to conclude that it went to produce
mechanical effects ; for it equally disappears in the other case when no mechanical
effect is produced. The true explanation of the matter, he thinks, is this : when we
reduce the current from « to b, we reduce the heat evolved in the conducting wire
from a2 to b2, but we only reduce the heat evolved in the entire circuit from a to b

hence there is no disappearance of heat whatever. The simple fact is, the heat

which is missing in the conductor will be found in the battery ; however, when

the engine is in motion there will be a deficiency in the total heat evolved equal to

the thermal equivalent of the mechanical work performed. When the engine beiDg

at rest the current is equal b, the total heat evolved is also equal b but when the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

current is reduced to b by the motion of the machine, the total heat evolved will

then be equal b -- x; x being the equivalent of the mechanical work performed.

The value of x, therefore, is not determined by the theory of Dr. Joule and Dr.

Scoresby.

    Let us consider the theory in relation to the origin of the mechanical work.

"When the current is equal b, without mechanical work being performed, the heat
evolved in the conductor is b2 ; when the current is b, and mechanical work per-

formed, according to the theory the heat evolved in the conductor is also equal b2.

In this case there is no reduction of heat in the conductor corresponding to the me-
chanical effect produced ; for the heat is as great when the mechanical effect takes
place as when it does not, being in both cases equal b2. This would lead to the

conclusion tbat the mechanical effect is not derived from the currents, for it could

not possibly produce its full equivalent of work, in the shape of heat b2 and x
amount of work in addition. The work x must, therefore, according to this theory,

be derived directly either from the chemical action in the battery or from the heat

evolved. That it is not directly dependent upon chemical action is evident from

                  * Philosophical Magazine, June 1846.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                  25

the fact that, if the current exist, x will arise the same as before, whether there be
chemical action or not, as, for example, when the current has a thermal origin
and that it is not derived from the heat evolved is evident also from the fact that
it has no existence when the heat is present in the circuit without the current.

The mechanical work ia therefore, contrary to the above theory, derived directly
from the electric current ; and it follows from hence that when we have two cur-
rents equal in every respect, the one performing mechanical work and the other

producing nothing but heat, less heat must be evolved by the former current than

by the latter ; consequently the law involved in the theory, viz. that the heat evolved

in similar conductors is proportional to the square of the currents, does not hold

true when one of the currents produces magnetical effects.

   Facts seem to lead to the following theory as a true explanation of the mechanical

power of electro-magnetism. Whatever our views may be regarding the nature of
the electric current, we must allow that the molecules of bodies offer a certain
amount of resistance to the passage of the current, which amount diners according

to the nature of the body through which the electricity is propagated. It must also
be admitted that the molecules of the body, in consequence of the resistance which

they offer, become heated. Let us take now the case of the conducting wire con-

necting the pole of a battery. Suppose it to be composed of a succession of mole-

cules A, B, C, D, &c. The chemical action in the battery communicates a certain
amount of motion to the atom A, in consequence of which its equilibrium is de-
stroyed, and to regain this state it transmits motion to the next adjoining atom B;

B Abut offers resistance to A, and the consequence is that is unable to communi-

cate to it the fidl amount of motion necessary to restore its own equilibrium, so

Athat must still retain a portion of the disturbing force or motion received from

the battery ; but on account of its position in space being limited by its relations

to surrounding molecules, it can only retain motion or force in itself by vibrating,

Band in virtue of these vibrations we affirm it to be hot. in like manner, to regain its

equilibrium, transmits motion to C, but C likewise offers resistance to B, and, of
course, B must also retain a portion of the disturbing force in the form of heat, and

what holds true of A, B, and C, holds equally true in regard to all the other mole-

cules of the conductor.

Let us now observe what takes place when work is being performed by an elec-
Wetro-magnetic engine.
                         have, in the first place, a continual evolution of force

arisino- from chemical action in the battery. This chemical force becomes imme-

diately transformed into electric current, and the electric force must in turn be

constantly transformed into some other form of force, or else we should instantly

have an accumulation of current. When the current is allowed simply to circulate

in the conductor without producing any work, either chemical or magnetical, its

entire force is transformed into heat, and the heat in turn is transmitted to sur-

rounding objects and radiated into space. This, as we have shown, is the effect of

Whenforces tending to a state of equilibrium.  the soft iron of the electro-mag-

netic engine is brought into the presence of the conductor, another channel or out-

let is then offered to the molecules of the conductor, whereby they may get rid of

the disturbing force, the electric current ; a portion of this force will be transferred

to the molecules of the iron, causing them to assume the magnetic state, and, of

course, whatever is consumed in work upon the molecules of the iron cannot appear

in the molecules of the conductor in the shape of heat. The moment the mole-

cules of the iron assume the magnetic state, no further transference of force in this

direction can take place ; but if they are allowed to perform mechanical work while

they are assuming this state, as is the case when the electro-magnetic engine is in

motion, then a constant outlet is afforded in this direction to the disturbed mole-

cules of the conductor to regain their equilibrium. But it must be observed that

the relative proportions of the force which pass through each of the two channels

or outlets, heat and magnetical work, do not remain the same, as Dr. Joule and

Dr. Scoresby's theory implies ; for as the force will always tend to the path of least

--resistance, the relative proportion passing through each outlet will be determined

by the relative resistance offered the quantity passing through each being in-

versely as the resistance to be overcome. Now the quantity x of mechanical work

that can be produced by an electro-magnetic engine from a given quantity of elec-
26 report--1862.

trie current, tmll depend entirely upon the amount of resistance offered by the, magnetic
element as an outlet to the electric force. If the iron is hard, and the resistance con-
sequently great, the amount of work will be but small ; but if the iron is soft and
the resistance offered small, then the amount of force transformed into magnetism
and available for mechanical purposes will be greater.

    In a paper read before the Chemical Society in March last, the author showed

that the same principle holds true also in regard to heat. When heat is applied

to a solid or a liquid body, a portion of the heat goes to raise its temperature, and
another portion is consumed in internal molecular work against cohesion. The
rising of the temperature and the separation of the molecules are the two paths
or outlets for the force, and the relative proportion which passes through each is
determined here in like manner by the resistance offered by each to the passage of

the force. Hence the reason why the specific heat of bodies increases as their

temperature rises ; for the resistance offered by cohesion decreases with rise of tem-
perature, thus allowing a greater proportion of the heat applied to become latent in
internal molecular work. It was stated as a general principle that, other things being
equal, the more easily fused a body is the greater is its specific heat. This was shown
also experimentally to be the case.

   In conclusion, in the production of molecular work by heat or mechanical work
by means of electro-magnetism, there exists no fixed relation between the amount
of heat applied and the work performed, for in both cases the quantity of work
varies with the molecular resistance offered.

  On Electric Cables, with reference to Observations on the Malta-Alexandria
                        Telegraph. By Dr. Ernest Esseebach.

   The three sections of this cable touching the shore at Tripoli and Benghazi

represent three condensers of 75,000 to 150,000 feet square, which, on account of their
size, disclosed several important facts in regard to the nature of the dielectric.

They allowed, in the first instance, a clear separation of the residual charge from the

resistance test. Dr. Esselbach arrived thereby not only at the true resistarce of

gutta perch a, but attained a new and entirely different test for insulation (electri-
fication test), by which the absence of electrolytic action in the covering could be

distinctly ascertained. These observations further afforded proof that the residual
charge on Leyden jars was not a penetration of electricity like that of heat in a
metal, but an increase of the specific inductive capacity of the material, and merely
a function of time, analogous to certain corresponding phenomena of torsion and
magnetism. The absolute quantity of charge, as ascertained in Dr. Esselbach's pre-
vious paper, showed that an increase in inductive capacity of one per cent., under
the influence of electric tension, was sufficient to account for what appeared to the

galvanometer as a change in resistance amounting sometimes to as much as 50 per

cent.

   Dr. Esselbach further showed his diagrams on earth-currents, extending over
one month's observation, indicating the great advantage which two lines of 500
and 600 miles from east to west, and one from north to south, in one continuation,
offer, and the facility and precision with which they are observed by Wheatstone's

bridge.

   The cable is taken roughly as being 2000 times better than the old Atlantic cable
and whereas in this latter at least 80 per cent, of the strength of current was lost in
the transit, more than 99 per cent, actually arrives in the present case at the other
end. The speed of a signal through this cable has been ascertained in different
ways, and in the most perfect way by Captain Spratt, C.B., incidentally, upon a
comparison between the longitude of Malta and Alexandria. The time for one
signal through the whole length of 1300 miles approaches one second nearly. The
author drew attention to the fact that the question of practical speed, after having
first been brought into prominence by Mr. Latimer Clark's experiments, had re-
mained in abeyance since Professor Thomson's researches at the time of the laying
of the Atlantic cable, after which all interest had been absorbed by the insulation
question, and very rightly, since it was first necessary to establish communication,
and with certainty, before trying to precipitate it. This appearing now assured by

a great and deserved success of manufacturers, attention could freely be turned to
experiments on speed, as entered upon by Messrs. Jenkin and Varley ; and he men-
tioned that applications had been made to Government from the first authorities to
take advantage of the Malta-Alexandria Telegraph for the purpose.

On an Experimental Determination of the Absolute Quantity of Electric Charge

                          on Condensers. By Dr. Esselbach.

   This quantity having first been approximately ascertained by Faraday, had been
afterwards established by the researches of Weber, Thomson, and Joule; but the
application of these results to submarine cables requiring intermediate reductions,
the author undertook a direct determination, for which the means had since become

available.

  A cable of certain description was charged (and discharged) by 100 Daniell's

400,000 times in 14h 30' ; this quantity of electricity deposited in four several

voltameters 12-9 mgr. of silver. The determination was repeated under different
conditions. The absolute quantity can hence be calculated for any other cable by
means of the well-known formula for determining their relative capacities. The
quantity of charge on the whole Malta-Alexandria cable by 20 cells (the ordinary
speaking power) is accordingly equivalent to 0-013 mgr. of silver, a quantity which
is furnished in -964 second by the battery in a closed circuit of 2500 units (one
Daniell by 1000 mercury units depositing 401 mgi*. of silver per hour). This

would therefore be the maximum speed with this battery, as far as merely the

quantity of electricity is concerned. During the investigation of the method which
preceded the experiment, Dr. Esselbach found the charge and discharge influenced
by the resistance to sufficient extent to admit of verifying experimentally the
second case of Professor Thomson's theory of discharge, which is of practical import-

ance for the question of velocity.

               Account of an Electromotive Engine. By G. M. Gut.

   The author explained the difficulty of obtaining, by any of the methods hereto-
fore suggested, a sufficiently rapid motion within the small spaces through which
magnets or electro-magnets acted with sufficient energy, and chiefly in consequence

of the rapid diminution of that energy as the distance of the poles increased, even

by very minute quantities. He exhibited and explained to the Section a working

model of the engine.

           Suggestions on Balloon Navigation. By Isaac Ashe, M.B.

   The author proposed a simple contrivance by means of which the opening of the
escape-valve should depend, when desirable, on the relaxation of voluntary exertion

on the part of the aeronaut, so that in the event of insensibility supervening at great
altitudes, the valve should open spontaneously by means of a weight attached to
its rope, thus causing a descent of the balloon to safer altitudes, and obviating the
danger to life incurred by Messrs. Glaisher and Coxwell during their recent scien-
tific ascent from Wolverhampton in consequence of their becoming insensible.

   Dr. Ashe also proposed the adaptation of screw propulsion to balloons, suggesting
a very light screw, capable of being elevated and depressed through an angle of
about 150°, so as to be capable of being hoisted while the balloon should be on the

ground, of being used horizontally as a propeller, or vertically underneath the car to
cause a temporary ascent, as for the purpose of crossing a mountain-range without
loss of ballast, which would involve remaining at the elevation so gained, or, on the
other hand, by reversing the action of the screw, to effect a descent without loss of
gas. Such a screw he considered could be worked at small elevations (2000 feet) by
the exertions of the aeronaut ; and its advantages would consist in the conferring, to
28 report--1862.

a certain degree, of definite direction, and also of steering-power, and in obviating

the objection to hydrogen balloons, which consisted in the expense of this gas, as a

descent could  be effected without  loss of gas                                                    hence smaller and much more  ma-
                                                                                                ;

nageable balloons might be constructed than those now in use, and propulsion by

means of a screw would be so much easier.

Steering-power being obtained,Dr. Ashe hoped that a modification of shape might

be found practicable, so as to present a minimum of resistance to propulsion by the
screw. He proposed to steer by means of two small screws connected by a cranked

axle placed at right angles to the action of the propeller, and situated" in front of

the car, so as not to interfere'with the hoisting of the propeller; these steering-

screws should have their spirals turned in the same direction, and by revolving them

in one direction, or the reverse, the balloon might be made to rotate on its vertical
axis as might be desirable. The disagreeable rotation incident to balloons might

also thus be obviated. Dr. Ashe suggested the employment of balloons in the in-

vestigation of aerial currents and circular storms, and for the exploration of unknown

continents : water, that great desideratum in such explorations, could be observed

from an elevation when it would otherwise be passed by unobserved, and a descent

being effected by the screw, its position might then be taken by observation, and

marked for the guidance of foot explorers. Similar remarks would apply to the

discovery of the easiest routes by means of balloon observations.

        On some Improvements in the Barometer. By Isaac Ashb, M.B.

   The author suggested a contrivance by which a water-barometer might be con-
structed, having a tube of not more than 3h feet in length, with a range in the
height of the column of liquid equal to about 39 inches. Though correct in theory,
this contrivance seemed to have some defects which would practically interfere with

its accuracy.

 On the Determination of Heights by means of the Barometer. By John Ball.

   The object of this paper was to direct attention to the serious errors which are in-

volved in the ordinary process of reducing barometric observations taken for kvpso-
metrical purposes. This process involves two assumptions : 1st, that the volume
of a column of air unequally heated is nearly the same as that of an equal weight

of air of the same mean temperature ; 2ndly, that the mean temperature of the
column or stratum of air between the stations of observation corresponds to the
mean of the readings of thermometers standing in the shade at each station. The

error involved in the first assumption is not very considerable ; that arising from
the second is, on the contrary, highly important.

   M. Bravais, who along with M. Charles Martins has contributed largely to our
knowledge of the meteorology of the Alps, was the first to propose a practical plan
for applying a correction to the assumed mean temperature of the air depending

upon the hour of the day and the season of the year at which observations are

made, but it is to M. Plantamour, the distinguished astronomer of Geneva, that we
owe the fullest investigation of this important subject.

   Having ascertained by careful levelling the true height of the Great St. Bernard
above Geneva, M. Plantamour finds that the mean of all the barometric observa-
tions, made during eighteen years, deviates by fourteen English feet from the true-

height, and he attributes this deviation, with great apparent probability, to an ab-
normal depression of the mean temperature of Geneva, owing to the neighbourhood

of the lake.

   The readings of the barometer and thermometer at the observatories of Geneva
and the St. Bernard are taken daily at nine hours or epochs. M. Plantamour
assumes that, on an average of a long period of years, the mean of the observations
taken at any one epoch in the twenty-four hours should give the true difference of
height between the two stations, with an error due to the difference between the
mean of the readings of the thermometers at both stations at the same epoch,
and the true mean temperature of the air in the intervening stratum. Calcula-
ting then the height of the St. Bernard by the elements corresponding to each
epoch of the day during the four summer months, from June to September,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  29

--he obtains a series of measures differing from the true height those corre-

sponding to the hottest hours being in excess, and those appertaining to the

coldest hours in defect of the true height. He then ascertains the amount of cor-

rection which, being applied to the mean sum of the readings of the thermometer

at each epoch in each of those months, -would bring out the true height. In this
manner he obtains a table, showing what he calls the normal correction for each

of the nine epochs of the day during the four summer months. There is good
reason to believe that, in reducing barometric observations which are to be com-
pared with Geneva and the St. Bernard, the application of the normal correction
ascertained in the manner above stated will in general give truer results than those
where this is not applied ; but as it is obvious that the conditions of temperature
at the moment when a given observation is made are constantly varying from the
mean of the corresponding day and hour, it follows that a further supplemental
correction should be made on this account.

   To apply this further correction is a matter of no slight difficulty. The method

employed by M. Plantamour is as follows. He obtains from the observations at
Geneva and the St. Bernard (by interpolation when necessary) the elements corre-

sponding to the day and hour of the observation which is sought to be reduced,
and from these he calculates the height of the St. Bernard. The height so obtained,
when compared with the measure which is derived from the mean of the readings
for the same day and hour, as shown in his Table of normal corrections, furnishes
a criterion by which to judge of the conditions with respect to temperature of the
moment when the observations to be reduced were made. M. Plantamour thinks it
not difficult to infer from the observations themselves, and from the general state
of the weather at the time, whether the moment was one of atmospheric equilibrium

or the reverse. In the latter case the observation is treated as one of inferior utility,
to which a lower value shoidd be assigned in the final calculation. Supposing,

on the contrary, the observations not to betray a disturbance of equilibrium between

the two stations, the deviation of the height, as calculated for that particular mo-
ment from the height derived from the corresponding means, is the measure of the
amount and sign of the supplemental correction corresponding to the moment of

observation.

   Without entering at present into sundry points of secondaiy importance, the
writer believes that, while it is at present impossible to clear the mode of dealing
with this correction of some arbitrary elements, it is easy to adopt a system less
cumbrous and less inconvenient, and at least equally accurate with that proposed by

M. Plantamour. He finds that many of the observations which appear to M. Plan-

tamour to be clear of anomalies arising from the disturbance of atmospheric equi-
librium, show unequivocal traces of such disturbance. These anomalies can be

eliminated only by comparing the observations in hand with many different stan-

dard stations, such as Milan, Turin, &c. ; but, in the absence of direct evidence, the
introduction of an empirical correction in the manner proposed is likely to lead to

error.

   The writer proposes to deal directly with the correction for temperature upon the
best information that is available in regard to each of the stations where observa-

tions are recorded. He considers that the deviation of the thermometer at the

time of observation from its mean height at the corresponding day and hour, is a
tolerably accurate measure of its greater or less deviation at that time from the true
temperature of the air freed from surface-radiation, and may therefore be taken

with its proper sign for the supplemental correction.

   It is important that the comparison between Geneva and St. Bernard, made by
M. Plantamour, should be extended to other stations near the base of the Alps,
and for this, as well as other reasons, it is highly desirable that the observations at
Milan and Turin shoidd be made at hours which correspond with the Swiss

observations.

                       On the Extent of the Earth's Atmosphere.

          By the Rev. Professor Challis, M.A., F.B.S., F.B.A.S.

The object of this paper was to show that the earth's atmosphere is of limited
 30 REPORT--1862.

 extent, and reasons were adduced, in the absence of data for calculating the exact
 height, for concluding that it does not extend to the moon. It was argued on the
 hypothesis of the atomic constitution of bodies, that the upward resultant of the
 molecular forces on any atom, since it decreases as the height increases, must
 eventually become just equal to the force of gravity, and that beyond the height at
 which this equality is satisfied, there can be no more atoms, the atmosphere termi-
 nating with a small finite density. It has been generally supposed that the earth's
 atmosphere is about 70 miles high, but on no definite grounds, and the estimates of
 the height have been very various. Against the opinion that it extends as far as

 the moon, it was argued that, as the moon would in that case attach to itself a con-
 siderable portion by its gravitation, which woidd necessarily have some connexion
 with the rest, there would be a continual drag on the portion more immediately
 surrounding the earth, and intermediately on the earth itself, which would in some
 degree retard the rotation on its axis. Hence if, as there is reason to suppose, the
 rotation be strictly uniform, the earth's atmosphere cannot extend to the moon. The

 author also stated that if by balloon ascents the barometer and thermometer were
 observed at two heights ascertained by observation, one considerably above the
 other, and both above the region in which the currents from the equator influence
 the temperature, data would be furnished by which an approximate determination
 of the height of the atmosphere might be attempted.

  On the " Boussole Burnier,'" a new French Poclcet Instrument for measuring

       Vertical and Horizontal Angles. By F. Galtox, F.R.S., F.R.Q.S.

    This instrument is about 3 inches long and f inch deep. Its outside is composed
of two faces of brass with pear-shaped outlines, separated by vertical sides. In
 the body of the instrument are two delicate circles placed in parallel planes ; at
its smaller end is a cylindrical lens, which views the nearer graduations on the
rims of the two circles ; on the upper face of the instrument are sight-vanes like
those of an azimuth compass ; on the lower face is a light universal joint, which is

used when the instrument is attached to a support, and not held, as it may be, in

the hand.

    One of the circles is of aluminium, and is borne by a compass-needle ; it gives
horizontal angles when the instrument is held horizontally. The other is of silvered
copper, unequally weighted, and is supported by a delicate axis playing in jewelled
holes : it gives vertical circles through the action of gravity when the instrument

is held vertically, just as the compass-circle gives azimuthal angles through the

action of the magnetic force when the instrument is held horizontally.
   The remarkable simplicity and compactness of the Boussole Burnier would make

it useful to the traveller, the geologist, and the military engineer. It is the inven-
tion of Lieut.-Col. Burnier of the French Engineers, and has been perfected in its
details by M. Balbreck, No. 81 Boulevard Mt. Pamasse, Paris.

EuropeanWeather-Charts for December 1861. By F. Galton, F.R.S., F.R.Q.S.

   The author submitted for examination a series of printed and stereotyped charts,
compiled bv himself, that contained the usual meteorological observations made at
eighty stations in Europe, on the morning, afternoon, and evening of each day of
December 1861. They were printed partly in symbols and partly in figures, in such
a form that each separate group of observations occupies a small label, whose centre
coincides with the geographical position of the station where the observations were
made. The amount of cloud is expressed by shaded types, the direction of the wind
by an equivalent to an arrow, and its force by a symbolical mark. The tempera-
ture of the wet and dry thermometers, and the barometric readings (reduced to zero
and sea-level) are given in figures. As the charts had been too recently printed to
admit of a thorough examination, and as they were ultimately to appear as a sepa-
rate publication, the author abstained from other deductions than those that were

obvious on inspection. Among these, the enormous range and the simultaneity of

the wind-changes, testifying to the remarkable mobility of the ah", were exceedingly

conspicuous.

    On the Distribution of Fog round the Coasts of the British Islands.
                            By Dr. Gladstone, F.B.S.

Certain conclusions on this subject formerly arrived at by the author had been

re-examined by means of additional returns from the meteorological journals kept

at all the stations belonging to the three general lighthouse authorities in England,

Scotland, and Ireland, and some returns lent him by Mr. James Glaisher. These

afforded confirmation of the greater uniformity of distribution of fogs over the

surface of the sea than on land, of their great prevalency where the south-west

wind from the ocean strikes upon high ground, of the comparative infrequency of

fog on the coasts of straits or portions of sea nearly surrounded by land, and other

points previously noted. The returns also indicated that some years are much more

foggy than others in nearly all localities ; that the same fog sometimes prevails

over a large extent of country ; and that the frequency of fog differs very greatly

in different months of the year, January, February, or March being on some coasts

    On a New Barometer used in the last Balloon Ascents.
                      By J. Glaishee, F.B.S.

Mr. Glaisher exhibited a mercurial barometer which had been designed and con-

structed by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra for the purpose of checking the readings

of the Gay-Lussac's barometer which had been used in the several late balloon

ascents. The correctness of the readings of a Gay-Lussac's barometer at low

pressure depended upon the evenness of the tube, and it is difficult to calibrate so

larpre a tube. Messrs. Negretti and Zambra selected a good tube, 6 feet in length,

attaching a cistern to its lower end. Mercury was boiled throughout the length of

the tube ; at the entrance of the cistern was placed a stopcock, by which means

any definite quantity of mercury could be allowed to pass from the upper half of

the tube into the cistern, and its height in the cistern noted and engraved ; then a

second portion, and so on. This process could be repeated. When the cistern

was thus satisfactorily divided, the tube was cut in two, and to the upper half the

cistern was joined                                                                                     a scale was attached to this portion, and                the reverse operation

was performed, viz., allowing portions of the mercury to pass from the cistern

into the tube, which could be regidated by means of the stopcock, and thus the

scale was divided. The process, in fact, is using the tube to graduate itself. In

carriage, the stopcock locks the mercury in the tube. This instrument was used,

and acted well on the extreme high ascent.

On the Additional Evidence of the Indirect Influence of the Moon over the
   Temperature of the Air, resulting from the Tabulation of Observations taken

  at Greenwich in 1861-62. By J. Park Harrison, M.A.

   The author stated that the additional evidence derived from the observations of
mean temperature at Greenwich for the years 1861-62 confirmed the conclusions
arrived at from a tabulation of the observations for the forty-seven years previous,

viz., that the temperature of the air at the moon's first quarter is higher than it is

at full moon and last quarter, and that this is due to the amount of cloud at first
quarter being greater on the average than it is at the periods of full moon and last
quarter. The difference in the amount of rain also at first quarter in 1861-62 was
2-27 inches more than at full moon, on a mean of eighty-four observations on seven

days at each period.

On the Belative Amount of Sunshine falling on the Torrid Zone of the Earth.
                           By Professor Hennesst, F.B.S.

    By the aid of the author's transformations of formulae given by Poisson, the area

of that portion of the equatorial regions of the earth which receives as much sun-

shine as the rest of the earth's surface is ascertained. This area, at the outer limits

of the earth's atmosphere, is thus found to be bounded by parallels situate at distances

of  23° 44' 40" at each side of the equator                                                                                                                     hence the amount of sunshine falling on

the outer limits of the earth's atmosphere between the tropics is very nearly equal to

that which falls on the remaining portions of the earth's surface. If we reflect that,
according to Principal Forties's researches, the amount of heat extinguished by the
atmosphere before a given solar ray reaches the earth is more than one-half for in-

clinations less than 25°, and that for inclinations of 5° only the twentieth part of

tbe heat reaches the ground, we immediately see that the torrid zone of the earth
must be far more effective than all the rest of the earth's surface as a recipient of

solar heat. It follows, therefore, that the distribution of the absorbing and radiating
surfaces within the torrid zone must, upon the whole, exercise a predominating in-
fluence in modifying general terrestrial climate.

On the Hurricane near Newark of Mai/ 7th, 1S62, showing the force of the
 Hailstones and the violence of the Gale. By E. J. Lowe, F.B.A.S. 4"c

The hurricane about to be described was accompanied by a thunder-storm, which

was more or less spread over the centre of England. On the previous evening there

were violent thunder-storms, accompanied in various places with large hailstones

and with rose-coloured lightning. The hurricane of the 7th of May was remarkable

for its violence near Newark, and for the violence of the thunder-storm which oc-

curred at the same time ; it will long be remembered in the neighbourhood on account

of the devastation that was caused, for the particularly striking night-like darkness,

for the great size and curious forms of the hailstones, and on account of the mag-

nificence of the colour of the lightning. At Highfield House the morning was

sultry, with thunder about noon, and again continuously in S. and S.E. at three

o'clock. At half-past two the temperature in shade had risen to 73°-6 with a west

wind, but the clouds whirling round in all directions, a low current carried broken

nimbi rapidly from west, whilst the storm-cloud was approaching in a S.S.E. cur-

rent. At half-past four o'clock the temperature had fallen to 00° (a descent of 130- 6

in two hours), whilst the wind had risen to half a gale. The thunder, though distant,

was frequent. The sky gradually became blacker and blacker, until at five o'clock

it was darker than I had ever before seen it except during a total eclipse of the sun.

A book with bold type could scarcely be read at a window, nor away from it could

the hands of a watch be seen. This storm put on very much the appearance of a

total eclipse ; near objects had a yellow glare cast upon them, and the landscape

was closed in on all sides at the distance of half a mile by a storm-cloud wall. Bain

fell in torrents, but not in an ordinary manner ; it was swept along the ground in

clouds like smoke. Flashes of lightning also came in impulses, four or five following

each other in rapid succession, succeeded by a brief pause, and then four or five

more. The colour of the lightning was lovely beyond description, being an intense

--bluish red almost rose. The wind now veered to the S.S.E., taking the storm's di-

rection. The temperature had descended to 51° (a fall of more than 22£-°), and the

anemometer showed 9 lbs. pressure on the square foot. Severe as this storm was at

Highfield House, it dwindled into insignificance when compared with its violence

near Newark. It is scarcely possible to imagine any destruction more complete

than that effected by this fearful storm. Fortunately its ravages were coniined

within narrow limits, being restricted to three miles in length and 150 yards in

width, commencing at the village of Barnby ; after proceeding a mile its violence

considerably increased ; before reaching Coddington it tore up the hedges that sur-

rounded the fields and unroofed the fami buildings. At Balderton Lane it threw

down farm buildings and uprooted enormous  oak-trees                                      a quarter of a mile further
                                                                                       ;

it unroofed the house of Mr. James Thorp's head keeper, the hailstones breaking

nearly all the windows, having in many instances been driven through the glass,

cutting out smooth holes. The spout of this house, too heavy for one man to lift,

was carried 100 yards, and a perfectly sound elm-tree, about 60 feet in height and

5 feet 10 inches in circumference (where broken off), was snapped asunder four

feet from the ground, and the tree carried twenty-nine yards through the air. The
wood of this tree was twisted to the very heart. Here a man was lifted off the

ground and then carried twenty yards, being unable to save himself, finally lodging

in a hedge. Thirty or forty yards from Mr. Thorp's house at Beaconfield" the hur-

ricane divided, leaving the house itself intact, and also the trees in its immediate

neighbourhood, from S. round by E. to N., while on the W. side outbuildings were

unroofed or destroyed, the large garden wall thrown down, and the fencing around

Athe plantations broken off and carried into the fallen timber.                                                           few yards beyond

the house the gale reunited, and passing through a wood destroyed all the trees ; it

then proceeded across fields as far as Winthorpe, and here its fury became exhausted.

     The gale rotated in the direction of W. to S., which was apparent from the twist

of the wood of the snapped-off trees, and also from an avenue of chestnuts situated

on the extreme eastern edge of the hurricane having all the torn-off boughs lying

on the S. or storm-side, and being carried back beyond the level of the trees.

Proposed Measurement of the Temperatures of Active Volcanic Foci to thi
   greatest attainable Depth, and of the Temperature, state of Saturation, and
    Velocity of Issue of the Steam and Vapours evolved. Bii Robert Mallet
   C.E., M.A., F.B.S.

     The author having circulated the following document amongst various Members

of the British Association a short time prior to the Meeting and during same, en-

larged upon the objects of his proposed experimental inquiry ; and explained to

--Section A, in part, the methods he intended to employ.
   Determination of Volcanic Temperature*. It is a singular fact, and one scarcely

creditable to the past investigation of volcanic phenomena, that up to this time no

careful attempt bas been made to determine, even approximately, the temperature

of the heated or incandescent focus of any active volcano, even at the mouth of the

crater, still less to depths lower down.

   Much labour and time have been lavished upon analysation of the gases and solid

--products evolved, and upon other still more minute inquiries more than was ne-

cessary, indeed, to obtain all the leading information as to the nature of vulcanicity

(using that general term to express the train of forces and of events whence the

supply of volcanic heat and energy is kept up) which such residts are capable of

yielding                                   but  the  most  obvious  of  all  physical                 data,  viz.  those  referring   to  the
                                        ;

actual temperature of volcanic foci at the" greatest attainable depths, have been

completely neglected by vulcanologists, either because they too hastily concluded

that experimental measurements of such were impossible, or, more probably, be-

cause, as often happens in the investigation of nature, the most obvious question is
that which is longest neglected being put to nature.

     The experiments that have been made on the heat of lava-/sswes, and upon the

temperatures of geysers, hot-springs, mines, &c, do Dot of course bear upon those

here in point.

   It seems almost unnecessary to dilate upon the importance to vulcanology, and
to all cosmical physics, of some precise information as to these focal temperatures,
the knowledge of which woidd assign limits at once to many speculations at pre-
sent vague and perhaps valueless, give measure to the estimation of the forces con-

cerned, and direct further investigation as to the sources whence these may be

derived.

     For brevity, the writer may venture to quote on this subject the following passage
from his Report to the Royal Society on the great Neapolitan earthquake of 1857 :--

     " I cannot find that any professed investigator of volcanos has ever thought of
making the very obvious and important experiment of lowering, with an iron wire,

a pyrometer as far as possible into a crater, in order to get some idea of its actual

temperature, even within a few score yards of its mouth.

  " When on Vesuvius, on the occasion of this Report, I feel satisfied that I could
have so measured the temperature of the minor mouth--then in powerful action--

to the depth of several hundred feet, had I possessed the instrumental means at
hand. To this smaller mouth it was then possible, by wrapping the face in a wet

cloth, to approach so near upon the hard and sharply-defined (though thin and

dangerous) crust of lava through which it had broken, as to see its walls for quite

150 feet down, by estimation. They were glowing hot to the very lips, althouo-h

constantly evolving a torrent of rushing steam with varying velocity. Accustomed

as I have been by profession for years to judge of temperature in large furnaces by

the  eye,  I  estimated                              the  temperature  of this  mouth,                bfy the  -awppwearance  of its  heate*i
                                                                                                   t

walls, at the lowest visible depth ; they were there of a pretty bright red, visible in

bright winter sunlight overhead. I have no doubt then that the temperature of

the shaft at from 300 to 500 feet down was sufficient to melt copper, or from 1900°

to 2000° Fahr.

   "From the extremely bad conducting power of the walls of a volcanic shaft,

there is scarcely any loss of heat from any cause, except its enormous absorption

in the latent heat, of the prodigious volume of dry steam, which is constantly being

evolved. It is perfectly transparent for several yards above the orifice of the shaft,

and  is  not  only  perfectly  dry  steam  but  also  superheated                                                      and  although  this steam
                                                                                                                    ;

may be at the mouth very much below the highest temperature of the hottest point,

the temperature of the shaft or duct that carries it oft will be very nearly at all

--depths the same, to probably within a very short distance of the point of greatest

incandescence." Rep. Roy. Soc, &c, Pt. n. chap. xii. vol. ii. pp. 313, 314.

The writer respectfully urges that the organization of experiments to determine

such data is a subject worthy the immediate attention of the British Association,

the Royal Society, and other similar scientific bodies.

From recent information he has reason to believe that the existing state of

Vesuvius is favourable to such experiments, which the writer is himself prepared

to attempt, provided the necessary apparatus and other means be placed at his dis-

posal. The experiments that he would in the first instance propose are

   (1) The temperature at the mouth or mouths, to the lowest reachable depths
within the Vesuvian craters.

   (2) The temperature of the issuing steam vapours or gases at the mouths, and
the degree to which the former are superheated.

   (3) Approximate determination of the velocity (extreme and mean) of the
issuing discharge of steam, &c, with a view to estimation of the volume, in given

time, and of the total heat carried oflj in same.

   For the 1st and 2nd, three or more mutually controlling methods may be
employed, a. The air pyrometer, or that of Daniell, maximum self-registering.

b. The differential bar pyrometer (of two metals), with constant galvanic con-
nexion to the surface, c. The resistance coil thermoscope, also in constant con-
nexion with the surface. The writer, as a practical engineer, has well-founded
hope of inserting either or all of these to a considerable and known depth within

the crater or craters.

   For the 3rd, analogous methods should be employed. For the 4th, there is no

doubt that Dr. Robinson's anemometer may be so modified as to be made avail-

able to determine the issuing velocity in various parts of the column. Into the
mechanical arrangements for placing, lowering, and observing, &c. these instru-

ments, it is not necessary here to enter.

   Vesuvius presents many advantages as a first experimental station ; but the

inquiry would afterwards be advantageously extended to other volcanic vents.

Whatever presumable difficulties may exist, if successfully overcome in the first

case, will nearly vanish as regards subsequent repetitions elsewhere.

      Oji Objections to the Cyclone Theory of Storms. By S. A. Rowell.

   Admitting that the winds in storms do at times take a more or less circular

course, and that whirlwinds may sometimes occur during storms, the author believed
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  35

that these are only occasional and minor phenomena in storms, and not the storm

itself, as represented in the cyclone theory. He objected to the cyclone theory on

the grounds that it is opposed to all the known natural laws which affect the con-

dition of the atmosphere, as he believed it to be impossible that a disk of some

hundreds of miles in diameter, but of a mere mile or so in thickness, of air lighter
than the general atmosphere, could make its way for days and days in succession

--through the densest part of the atmosphere, that the evidence in support of the

theory is insufficient (this he attempted to show by the aid of diagrams from Reid's

' Law of Storms,' and a general reference to works of the kind), and that the phe-
nomena of the (so-called) cyclone storms may be otherwise accounted for.

   On the Performance, under trying circumstances, of a very small Aneroid
                             Barometer. By Gr. J. Stmons.

   This instrument, which the author exhibited, had been worn constantly by him

recently while at sea in rough weather, while riding and driving over roadless

districts in the Orkneys, and also on several occasions when rough climbing and
severe jumps had been necessary : he therefore presumed he might reasonably con-

clude that it had been fully tried. It had been tested before, during, and after the
voyage, and had in each case given the same result when compared with mercurial

standards. He therefore inferred that it might be considered even less liable to

derangement from travel than an ordinary watch. The instrument was very small,

being only two inches in diameter and three-quarters of an inch thick.

 On the Disintegration of Stones exposed in Buildings and otherwise to Atmo-
          spheric Influence. By Professor James Thomson-, M.A., C.E.

   The author having first guarded against being understood as meaning to assign

--any one single cause for the disintegration of stones in general, gave reasons to

show 1st. That there may frequently be observed cases of disintegration which
are not referable to a softening or weakening of the stone by the dissolving away

or the chemical alteration of portions of itself, but in which the crumbling is to be
attributed to a disruptive force possessed by crystalline matter in solidifying itself
in pores or cavities from liquid permeating the stone. 2nd. That in the cases in
question the crumbling away of the stones, when not such as is caused by the freez-
ing of water in pores, usually occurs in the greatest degree at places to which, by
the joint agency of moisture and evaporation, saline substances existing in the
stones are brought and left to crystallize. 3rd. That the solidification of crystal-
line matter in porous stones, whether that be ice formed by freezing from water,
or crystals of salts formed from their solutions, usually produces disintegration
not, as is implied in the views commonly accepted on this subject, by expansion of

--the total volume of the liquid and crystals jointly, producing a fluid pressure in the

pores but, on the contrary, by a tendency of crystals to increase in size when in
contact with a liquid tending to deposit the same crystalline substance in the solid
state, even where, to do so, they must push out of their way the porous walls of the
cavities in which they are contained, and even though it be from liquid permeating

these walls that they receive the materials for their increase.

                                   CHEMISTRY.

Address by Professor W. H. Miller, M.A., F.R.8., President of the Section.

Once in about a quarter of a century a mineralogist is placed in the chair of the

Chemical Section of the British Association. This procedure is not without its

inconvenience : many important questions are likely to present themselves during

the meetings of the Section which a mineralogical president can rarely be competent
to decide. In another point of view, however, this arrangement is more satisfactory

                                                                                                     3*

it is symbolical of the removal of a barrier which once threatened to separate
mineralooT from chemistry, to the serious detriment of both. While some minera-
logists sought to exclude chemistry from their systems, chemists intent upon dis-
covery in the newly opened field of organic chemistry neglected mineral analysis.
But of late these mutually estranged sciences have exhibited a growing tendency

to reunite, and to aid one another. The chemists now freely admit the mineralogists

as their associates, not unfrequently sharing their labours, and include geometrical

and optical characters in the descriptions of the new combinations they discover.
Of this we have instances in the memoirs of Kopp, Rammelsberg, Hofmann, Sella,

Marignac, Des Cloizeaux, and in those of Haidinger, Leydolt, Grailich, Dauber,
Schabus, v. Lang, Schrauf, v. Zepharovich, Rotter, A. and E. Weiss, Murmann, and
Handl. The experiments on the formation of minerals, commenced by Berthier
and Mitscherlich, have since been varied in almost every possible way. Ebelinen,

de Senarmont (whose recent death is a grievous loss to the sciences we cultivate),

Daubre'e, Wbhler, Manross, and H. Deville have successfully imitated the processes
of nature in producing a large number of crystallized minerals in the laboratory,
and thus have helped to obliterate the boundary arbitrarily drawn between the
studies of the chemist and those of the mineralogist.

   The memoirs I have cited in proof of the intimate connexion of chemistry and
mineralogy deserve our especial attention for another and more important reason.
The observations they record, being made on crystals of accurately known compo-
sition, far exceeding the crystallized minerals in number, and differing from minerals
in being quite free from any admixture of foreign matter, furnish the only data
from which we may hope that some future Newton of the science will be enabled
to discover a simple law of the dependence of the form, optical and physical pro-
perties of crystallized bodies on the substance of which they are composed.

           On the Formation of Organo-MetaTlic Radicals by Substitution.

                        By George Bowdlee Becetost, F.R.S.

   The object of this inquiry was to investigate the order in which the metals of
the organo-metallic radicals were capable of substitution, through the agency, in
the first place, of simple metals, in the second place, of salts of simple metals, and

in the third place, of salts of other organo-metallic bodies.

   It was found that when metals acted upon these radicals, substitutions were
affected, in the greater number of cases, in the order indicated by the ordinary

electro-positive or electro-negative position of the contained metals. Exceptional

cases, however, occurred.

   By the action of sodium on mercuric ethyl, the mercury is partly extruded, and
a double compound of mercuric and sodium-ethyl is obtained.

   By the action of chloride of cadmium on zinc-ethyl, appreciable quantities of cad-

mium-ethyl were formed, which, however, coidd not be satisfactorily separated,
either by distillation or the action of anhydrous solvents, from the unctuous mass
of chloride of zinc which is one product observed.

   Mercuric ethyl and bichloride of tin react powerfully with the evolution of much

heat, and result in the separation of chloride of mercuric ethyl and chloride of

stannic sesquiethyl, according to the equation

          On the Action of Nitric Acid upon Pyrophosphate of Magnesia.

posed in an open capsule to temperatures ranging from 320° F. to 550° F. till the

weight became constant for each temperature, it was invariably found to have in-

creased very much in weight, although not always to the same extent, as shown

below :

                                 Temperature.  Percentage increase of weight. Difference.

                                    320° F.        22 to 30                   8 per cent.

                                 420               19 to 21                   2,,

                                 550               13-5 to  14-5              1,,

When the pyrophosphate of magnesia, still retaining nitric acid, but constant in

weight at 320° F., was heated sufficiently to drive off all the nitric acid, it was found

to have decreased in weight, not to a uniform amount, but varying from 9 to 15

per cent., according to the greater or less rapid application of heat ; on heating in

the same manner the pyrophosphates of magnesia retaining nitric acid, and constant

in weight at 430° F. and 550° F., they were found likewise to have decreased much

in weight, although not to so great an extent, by pyrophosphate of magnesia being

volatilized along with the nitric acid.

It is inferred from these experiments that nitric acid has a stronger affinity for

magnesia than pyrophosphoric acid has, and that on adding nitric acid to pyrophos-

phate of magnesia, nitrate of magnesia is formed, pyrophosphoric acid being libe-

rated                            and this was proved to be the case by dissolving pyrophosphate of magnesia
                              ;

in nitric acid, evaporating the solution till syrupy, and then placing it under a

bell -jar over sulphuric acid; after a time nitrate of magnesia crystallized, and

pyrophosphoric acid could be drained off.

But although nitrate of magnesia is formed and pyrophosphoric acid set free on

the addition of nitric acid to pyrophosphate, it is probable that, when this mixture

is evaporated and heated, the products are not always mere mixtures of nitrate of

magnesia and pyrophosphoric acid, but that they are sometimes compounds ; and

the reasons for this opinion are, that these products are but slightly deliquescent,

that nitric acid is less readily expelled from them than from nitrate of magnesia,

and that on heating these products suddenly, pyrophosphate of magnesia is volati-

lized, though it is not under ordinary circumstances a volatilizable salt.

   From the above results, the author recommends the discontinuance of moistening

the pyrophosphate with nitric acid when calcining it, when estimating phosphoric
acid or magnesia, as it may be apt to lead to a source of error.

Memoire stir les modifications tempo-retires et permanentes que let chalewr ctpporte
   a quelques proprietes optiques ele certains corps cristallises. Petr A. Des

    Cloizeattx.

  On sait, d'apres d'aneiennes rechercb.es de MM. Brewster et Mitscherlich, que

dans certains cristaux 1'ecarternent des axes optiques et l'orientation de leur plan
varient avec la temperature. Pendant longtemps on n'a guere connu que les pheno-
nienes si tranche's qui se rnanifestent dans la Glauberite et le gj'pse. J'ai constats'
recemment qu'un assez grand nombre de substances anhydres ou hydratees, telles
que le feldspath orthose, la Heulandite, la Prehnite, le clinochlore, la cymophane,
la Brookite, &c, subissaient aussi l'influence de la chaleur d'une inaniere plus ou

moms marquee; mais de plus j'ai decouvert que si Ton elevait suffisamment la

temperature, ce qu'il est facile de faire pour l'ortkose, la cymophane et la Brookite,
par exemple, les modifications optiques, de temporaires qu'elles sont lorsqu'on ne
depasse pas 300 a 400 degres Centigi-ades, deviennent entierement permanentes. Le
mineral qui, par sa transparence et son homogeneite, se prete le mieux aux experi-

ences les plus varices et les plus exactes, est un orthose vitreux de Wehr dans l'Eifel,

et e'est sur une plaque de cette nature que j'ai obtenu les resultats suivants.

On voit que Tecarternent des axes optiques va toujours en augmentant avec la tem-

perature, et que l'augnientation est beaueoup plus rapide de 42° a 142° que de 142°

a 342°.

   Les observations, re"petees un grand nonibre de fois, ont e"te faites an moyen d'un
gonionietre particulier install e sur un microscope polarisant, dont j'ai donne une de-
scription abre'gee en 185U dans le torn. xvi. des ' Annales des Mines,' et que j 'ai Thon-
neur de mettre sous les yeux de la Section. La plaque est soumise a un coiirant d'air
chaud fourni par vine lampe a alcool, et circulant dans une cheminee horizontale en

cuivre placee sur le microscope ; l'e'cartement des axes optiques peut etre mesure" a
chaque instant a travers deux ouTertures pratiquees au centre des parois horizontalea
de la cheminee et munies d'une glace mince ; la temperature de l'air est hidique'e
en rneme temps par deux thermometres places a droite et a gauche de ces ouvertures.

                                                                                                                                             T !C3

Mais en emploj-ant ce proce'de', je ne pouvais pas depasser une temperature d'environ

350°. Pour m'assurer si les phe"nomenes suivaient la meme marcbe au-dela de cette
temperature, j'ai place mon microscope dans une position horizontale, et sur le pror

pour plus de facilite j'ai oper6 avec un ven-e rouge nionochromatique.

Une plaque, qui a 14° Cent, avait ses axes rouges e'carte's de 18° 30' dans un plan

Sarallele au plan de symetrie, a montre, de3 la premiere application de la chaleur,

euxsystemes d'anneaux dont le nombre augmentait rapidement tandis que leur

diametre diminuait                                                                            leur            fomie ainsi que  celle des     hyperboles  qui les traversent a

et les hyperboles se sont defonnes en se brisant, la mesure de 1 ecarternent ne s'est

=plus faite qu'ayec difficulte, et vers 700° elle a donne successivement 2E 118°, 122°,

124°. L'experience ayant ete an-etee pour ne pas faire eclater les lentilles du mi-

croscope, la plaque s'est refroidie rapidement, les phenomenes optiques ont repasse

par toutes les phases qu'ils avaient de"ja parcourues, et a 15° Cent, j'ai retrouvd

Tangle des axes egal a 19° ; il ne s'etait done produit aucune modification perma-

nente. Cette plaque soumise plusieurs fois aux memes epreuves a toujours oflert des

apparences semblables                                                                                         l'accroissement de temperature semblait augmenter son

un plan parallele a la diagonale horizontale de la base et ses axes bleus e'eartes de
A16° 30' dans un plan parallele au plan de syme"trie, s'est comportee d'une maniere
analogue.     partir du rouge naissant le plus foible, les anneaux se deformaient

fortement, les hyperboles disparaissaient, et Tangle apparent des axes, qui <$tait con-
siderable, ne pouvait plus se niesiu-er exactement.

   Des re"sultats precedents il semble permis de conclure que jusqu'a, 350° environ
la conductibilite calorifique n'eprouve pas de cbangernent notable dans l'interieur du
feldspatb ortbose, mais qu'a partir de 400° ou 500° la propagation de la cbaleur s'y
fait d'une maniere assez inegale pour provoquer teniporairement une perturbation
plus ou moins profonde dans l'equilibre de ses arrangements moleculaires. Cet
equilibre peut reprendre son etat primitif apres le refroidissement, si la perturba-
tion n'a dure que 2 ou 3 minutes a une temperature qui ne depasse pas 700°. Nous
allons voir maintenant qu'en prolongeant 1 action de la cbaleur pendant un temps
suffisant, au rouge sombre ou au rouge blanc, il en re"sulte une nouvelle disposition
pbysique qui se manifeste par des modifications permanentes dans l'orientation et

l'ecartement des axes optiques.

de Binnen, j'ai trouve que toutes eprouvent sous l'influence de la chaleur des modi-
fications permanentes et temporaires analogues a celles du feldspath vitreux de
Wehr. Calcines au rouge sombre ou au rouge vif, les echantillons les plus trans-

parents et les plus homogenes, comme ceux de Wehr et de la Somma, conservent

 leur aspect primitif sans autre changement apparent que celui des fissures, paralleles
 a leurs deux clivages rectangulaires, qui deviennent plus prononce'es ; d'autres pren-

nent une teinte laiteuse plus ou moins marquee ; d'autres enfin, comme ceux des
 trachytes, deviennent presque completement opaques. Dans tous les cas, la perte

et une orientation qui peut avoir lieu dans deux plans rectangulaires entre eux, avec

une dispersion d'autant plus considerable que l'ecartement est plus petit. II existe

done une grande analogie entre la constitution physique de ces deux mineraux et

celle des feldspaths du cinquieme systeme cristallin. Aussi la calcination determine-

t-elle dans leurs proprietes optiques des modifications pennanentes et temporaires

entierement semblables a celles que j'ai decouvertes dans l'orthose. Si Ton rapporte

les formes de la eymophane a un prisme rbomboidal droit de 119° 46', on voit que

dans les cristaux du Bresil les plus transparents et les plus honiogenes, le plan des

axes optiques est normal a la base et la bissectrice aigue positive, parallele a la petite

diagonale de cette face. L'angle des axes correspondant au rouge peut s'elever

jusqu'a 120°, et celui des axes correspondant au bleu jusqu'a 118°. Certaines plages

a reflets opalins montrent des axes rouges reunis et des axes bleus separes dans un

plan parallele a la base ; d'autres plages font voir les axes correspondant a toutes

les couleurs separes dans ce meme plan. Une elevation de temperature a pom- effet

de rapprocher les axes orientes parallelement a la base et d'eearter ceux dont l'orien-

tation lui est perpendiculaire. Jusqu'au rouge naissant les changements ne sont

que temporaires, mais une calcination de 15 minutes a la temperature de la fusion

de l'argent suffit pom les rendre permanents et deja, considerables. La perte en

poids est, comme pour l'orthose, de 1 milligramme par gramme, et 1' aspect exterieur

de la substance n'est nullement niodifie'.

Pour la Brookite dont on peut faire deliver les fonnes d'lm piisme rhombique de

99° 50', le plan des axes optiques est tantot parallele, tantot perpendiculaire a la

base; la bissectrice est positive et reste toujours parallele a la petite diagonale de

cette face. La dispersion est ties considerable, et lorsque les axes sont situes dans

le plan de la base, les rouges sont plus ecartes que les violets ; leur ecartement aug-
niente d'une maniere temporaire par une calcination foible, et d'ime maniere penna-

nente par une calcination plus energique. Dans un e"chantillon du Dauphine ou.
l'angle des axes £tait de 52° a 20° Centig. j'ai observe temporairement un e"carte-
nient de 65° a 220° Centig. Une autre plaque, chauffe'e avec precaution dans une

moufle, a eprouve une modification pennanente qui a porte Tangle de ses axes rouges

de 42° a 47°.

Les perturbations permanentes que le changement de temperature apporte dans

l'equilibre moleculaire du feldspath orthose ayant e"galement lieu dans la eymophane

et la Brookite, sont evideinnient independantes de la composition chimique des corps

cristallises. Les experiences faites dans les fours de Sevres, ou le refroidissement

est tres lent, ne permettent pas d'aillems d'attribuer ces perturbations a des eft'ets

de trenrpe, comme on pourrait etre tente de le faire an premier abord ; on peut done
les regarder reellement comme en rapport avec la constitution physique de certains

cristaux, et Ton doit admettre que la position des axes optiques ainsi que leur dis-

persion est susceptible de varier dans une meme espece ruine'rale avec la temperature

a laquelle les cristaux sont ou ont ete soumis.

    On the Mode ofpreparing Carbonic Acid Vacua in large Glass Vessels.

                                By J. P. Gassiot, F.B.S.

   During the process of preparing carbonic acid vacuum-tubes for his experimental
researches on the Stratified Electrical Discharge (Philosophical Transactions, 1859;
Proceedings, 1860-1861), the author ascertained that -when the stopper of a glass
vessel is very carefully ground, the vacuum will remain without the slightest alter-

ation for many months : among a variety of tubes thus prepared, he has one with

four glass stoppers, three of which are nearly one inch in diameter. It is upwards
of twelve months since this vacuum was prepared, and to the present time, when-
ever the discharge from an induction coil is passed through it, there is not the
slightest alteration in the appearance of the stnae.

    If a larger aperture is requisite instead of the stopper, all that is requisite is to

have the two surfaces of the glass very carefully ground, in the same manner as
the bell-glasses for an air-pump are prepared ; by these means glass vessels of
almost any required dimensions can be used, provided care is taken that the form

is such as will resist the pressure of the atmosphere.

   The potash necessary to absorb the residue of the carbonic acid after the exhaus-
tion by the air-pump, may be placed at the bottom of the vessel, and gently heated
on a sand-bath or by a spirit-lamp, or it may be placed in a tube, and subsequently
sealed off by the blowpipe.

                On the Essential Oil of Bay, and other Aromatic Oils.

                         By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.B.S.

  -- AThis paper consisted of 1st. description of the essential oils of Bay, Bergamot,

Carraway, Cassia, Cedar-wood, Cedrat, Citronella, Cloves, Indian Geranium,

Lavender, Lemon Grass, Mint, Neroli, Nutmeg, Patchouli, Petit-grain, Portugal,

Rose, Santal-wood, Turpentine, and Winter-green, with the specific gravities and
powers of refraction, dispersion, and circular polarization. 2nd. Some remarks on

the isomeric hydrocarbons, which may be derived from the majority of the essen-

tial oils, and which generally resemble each other very closely, though they are
rarely identical. 3rd. Notices of some of the oxidized bodies present in these oils,

which are generally more refractive and more aromatic than the hydrocarbons of
which they are oxygen substitution products.

 --Among the observations were the following: Oil of Bay consists of a hydrocarbon

Hof the ordinary type, C 20 16, and eugenic acid. Oil of Neroli contains two hydro-

carbons, one of which is a fluorescent body. The essential oil of Petit-grain, which

is derived from the leaves of the orange-tree, contains a hydrocarbon resembling the
more volatile one from oil of Neroli, which is prepared from the orange flower ; and

so does the oil of Portugal, from the orange peel. Otto of roses is an oxidized oil
the crystallizable portion of it has a great attraction for ether vapour. The oils of

Citronella and of Lemon-grass, from different species of Andropogon, cultivated

in Ceylon, consist mainly of oxidized oils which are nearly if not quite identical.

There is a very wide difference in the action on the polarized ray exerted by dif-
ferent essential oils, both in regard to amount and direction.

On the Means of observing the Lines of the Solar Spectrum due to the Terres-
             trial Atmosphere. By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.B.S.

   The object of this communication was to incite observers in various parts to
notice those lines and bands which appear in the spectrum when the sun is near
the horizon. They vary imder different atmospheric conditions, and probably in
different parts of this and other countries. The author had found one of Crookes's
pocket spectroscopes sufficiently powerful to exhibit all the most important of
them, and very convenient for taking up mountains, &c. All observations should
be referred to the map published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1860.

                    On a particular Case of induced Cliemical Action.

                           By A. Vernon Haecotjkt, M.A.

   It has been observed by Mohr, Scheurer-Kestner, and other chemists, that when
a protosalt of tin is determined by means of a standard permanganate solution, the
results obtained vary according to the degree in which the solution of tin-salt is
diluted. The greater the dilution, the less is the amount of permanganate required.
This variation is justly ascribed by the two chemists above named to the influence
of the oxygen which the water used in diluting holds dissolved. With recently
boiled water, the effect is less ; with water which has been absolutely freed from

air, it disappears.

   If these facts stood alone, their explanation would seem simple, viz. that chloride
of tin is speedily oxidized when mixed with water containing oxygen. But this

is not the case, especially when much free acid has been added. If iodine, or per-

chloride of iron, or sulphate of copper is used as the oxidizing agent, the result of

the determination is the same, whether the tin solution be little or much diluted.
--44 report 1862.

Hence it appears that in the former case the action of the dissolved oxygen is de-

termined by the action of the permanganate*.

In order' to investigate quantitatively the relation of these two actions, several
--Aseries of determinations were made in the following manner :
                                                                       measured quantity

of a solution of protochloride of tin of convenient strength was determined, first

without dilution, and then, in successive experiments, after dilution with regularly

increasing quantities of water. Immediately before and during each determina-

tion, a stream of carbonic acid was poured into the flask containing the liquid to

be determined, in order to guard it from contact of air. The conclusions to which

--these experiments have led are as follows : (1) When the diluting water contains
only so much oxygen as is sufficient to oxidize about one-third of the protochloride of

tin  present,  the  whole  of  this  oxygen  is  appropriated  in the  reaction                                 (2) after this
                                                                                                             ;

point, the amount of induced oxidation is still increased by further dilution, but in a

continual^ diminishing degTee, until it bears to the primary oxidation (that by

the permanganate) about the ratio of 2:3; (3) still greater dilution produces no

further change. It has not yet been found possible to determine the exact ratios of

the primary and of the induced oxidation one to another at that point at which

the absorption of dissolved oxygen ceases to be complete, and at the final limit,

where the induced oxidation has reached a maximum.

With what other chemical actions are we acquainted which belong to the same

class as this action ?

   Four examples may be adduced of actions more or less analogous. 1. The action

of platinum-black, and other similar substances, in causing oxidation. These sub-

stances, however, do not, so far as we know, themselves undergo any change
whereas the permanganate can act inductively only during the moment of its own

direct action. 2. The action of nitric oxide upon sulphurous anhydride and oxygen.

3. The action of pentachloride of antimony in presence of free chlorine in causing
the formation of chlorine compounds. But in these two cases also an important
distinction is to be noted. The products of the initial action, nitrous oxide and
terchloride of antimony, are capable of combining directly with free oxygen and

free chlorine respectively ; whereas the final product at least of the reduction of an
acid solution of permanganate is not liable to reoxidation, and such a solution can

accordingly be reduced by many substances in the presence of dissolved oxygen
without appropriating or conveying it. 4. The acetous fermentation. The fact
that the oxidation of alcohol by free oxygen may be induced by the presence of
other substances undergoing chemical change bears some resemblance to the fact
here brought forward. It is not improbable that the two may depend upon a
common cause.

   But no case that has been yet examined is directly and unmistakeably parallel to
this action. At the same time, it is doubtless but one of a class. The action of
other similar oxidizing bodies, such as chromic acid, and of other substances readily

susceptible of oxidation, such as sulphurous acid, hydriodic acid, &c, in presence
of dissolved oxygen, may probably present similar phenomena. With the action,

in dilute solutions, of chromic acid on sulphurous acid, and permanganic acid on

sulphurous acid, this has been ascertained to be the case.

                                    On Schonbein's Antozone.
         By G. Haelet, M.D., Professor in University College, London.

   In 1842 Schafhaiitl called attention to a fluor-spar, the pecidiar smell of which
he imagined to be due to the presence of hypochlorite of lime. Schbnbein shortly
afterwards found that it contained an oxidizing agent which Sckrbtter subsequently

described as ozone. Schonbein has now repeated his experiments on a better

quality of the mineral, and finds that the oxygen contained in it resembles that

yielded by Ba 2 ; and that distilled water in which the mineral has been pounded

   * Since reading the paper of which the above is an abstract, the author has become
aware that this fact had already engaged the attention of the German chemist Lowenthal,
who, in conjunction with E. Lennsen, has recently shown that dissolved oxygen is similarly
rendered active in some other cases (Journ. fur Prakt. Chem. 1859, part i. p. 484, and
vol. bri. (1862) p. 193).

acquires peculiar properties. At the request of Professor Liebig, who had given

Dr. Harley some fine specimens of the mineral, the latter gentleman showed some
of the more striking properties of the mineral to the members of the Association.
For example, the distilled water in which the mineral has been pulverized, when
filtered gives no precipitate «vith nitrate of silver, and only the very slightest tur-
bidity with oxalate of ammonia and with weak sulphuric acid. From this it is
seen that no chlorine is present, and only a trace of an earthy base. The liquid
blues iodized starch, decolorizes a solution of permanganate of potash acidified
with sulphuric acid, at the same time liberating oxygen gas. The liquid gives a
blue with the brownish mixture of dilute ferridcyanide and perchloride of iron, and

gradually precipitates prussian blue. When mixed a short time with the peroxide

of lead and finely reduced platinum-powder, it loses some of the above-named pro-

perties. Heating the mineral entirely destroys its properties. Schonbein concludes
from these and other facts that the mineral contains antozone.

             On the Adulteration of Linseed Cake with Nut-cake.

                            By W. H. Harris, F.C.S.

The frequent adulteration of linseed cake, used for cattle-feeding purposes, has

drawn considerable attention on the part of the agricultural chemist to the differ-
ent adulterative substances employed by the trade. Many of these have been from

time to time exposed. But there is one substance largely used for adulterating lin-

seed cake, which has not, that I am aware of, received the notice which it deserves.

The substance I refer to is the market nut-cake, obtained from the fruit of the Arachis

hypogea, or Ground-nut of America, indigenous to Mexico, but cultivated in the

West Indies. As botanists are aware, it derives its name from the singular manner

in which its fruit is perfected ; for as its yellow papilionaceous flowers fall from

their stalks, the pods which follow are forced by a natural motion of the plant into

--the ground, where the seeds ripen and come to perfection hence the name of

Ground-nut.

   As the cake composed of the marc of these seeds can be purchased at about half

--the price of linseed cake, it is often used for the purpose of adulteration a fact

patent to most agricultural chemists. But this substance seems to have been gene-

rally condemned as a worthless  article                                for we have seen this verdict given against
                                                                    ;

it in several instances by eminent agricultural chemists ; at any rate, if I am mis-

taken in the article of commerce which has been classed with bran, rice dust, and

treated as rubbish, the mistake is attributable to an unfortunate looseness of lan-

guage adopted by the authorities in question.

  My attention being directed to the true feeding qualities of this substance was

accidental ; for having to analyse a sample of linseed cake which contained a con-
siderable quantity of bran, I was surprised to find the analytical result, in reference

to the percentage of flesh-formers, was considerably superior to the result I had

obtained from many genuine samples I had analysed. This led me to resubmit
the cake to a carelul microscopic examination, which enabled me to detect what

afterwards proved to be the decorticated nut-cake of commerce.

  My next step was to get a sample of this nut-cake in its simplicity; this,

through the kindness of a gentleman connected with the trade, I succeeded in doing.

On submitting this sample to analysis, the result exceeded my highest expectations.

as the following results of the examination will show :

ble of sustaining a successful competition with linseed cake itself, and not more

than two-thirds the market value of the latter, it now only remained to prove that
its practical answered to its theoretic value. Of this there did not appear to me to

he any serious doubt ; nevertheless I thought it better to put the matter to the test

Aof practical experiment. friend to whom I named the subject readily entered into

the plan of trying the effect of this cake upon a portion of his stock ; the result

proved his cattle would eat it with eagerness, and, as far as the experiment has gone,

it has answered our highest expectations.

                On a Simple Method of talcing Stereomicro -photographs.

By Charles Heisch, F.O.S., Lecturer on Chemistry at the Middlesex Hospital.

After trying various plans, the author devised the following, which answered

Aperfectly.     microscope with its eyepiece removed is placed in a horizontal posi-

tion, and fitted to an ordinary sliding back, single lens, stereoscopic camera. Be-

hind the object-glass is screwed an adapter, in the inside of which is a tube, which

can be turned half round by means of a lever from the outside. Sliding in this

tube is a second, furnished with a stop which cuts oh' half the pencil of light coming

from the object-glass, in fact occupies the same place as the prism of a binocular

microscope. The distance of this stop from each object-glass is adjusted experi-

mentally by sliding the tube backwards and forwards till the best effect is obtained.

The prepared plate being put in its place after carefully focusing the object, the

first picture is taken. The plate is then shifted, the stop turned half round, and

the second picture taken on the other half of the plate. If the object be of any

thickness, its upper surface should be focused for one picture, and its under surface

                 Loiue's Ozone Box. By E. J. Lowe, F.B.A.S. §c.

   This box has been constructed so as to ensure perfect darkness to the test-paper
without interfering with the passage of a current of air. There are two openings
into this cylindrical box, the one above and the other below. These openings are
not direct into the box itself, but into narrow winding passages in the first instance
they are also opposite each other. If the wind is blowing in an easterly current,
and the upper opening is on the east side, then the air will enter the box on the

                Fig. 1.                                     Fig. 2.

upper half (fig. 1), will move round the circular passage until it enters the central

mcavity (A) where the test-paper is hung, afterwards passing round the lower pas-

sage (fig. 2) a contrary direction, and out again at the west aperture. Or if the
wind happens to be in the opposite direction, it will enter from below and leave the
box from above. Ihe advantage is obvious--a current of air passes through a dark
chamber. The box is small, and its price almost nominal.

Observations on Ozone. By E. J. Lowe, F.B.A.S. $c.

   The following are   results  of  observations  made  at  theBeeston  Observatory  durin°g

the past four years :

   1st. If the temperature is raised, the amount of ozone will increase.
   2nd. If the current of air through the box increases in rapidity, the amount of

ozone will increase.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  47

3rd. As the barometer becomes lower, the amount of ozone becomes greater.

   1st. If the temperature be ranged in 10° series, a temperature between 30° and
       40° will give less ozone than one between 40° and 50°, and this less than one
      between 50° and 60°. Artificially, if a night-light be made to burn in a

     cell below the box so as to warm it, there will be an increase in the

      amount of ozone over another box that is without a night-light.
   2nd. With respect to an increase in ozone resulting from an increase in the

      speed of the air, it is shown from this series of observations that the most
      ozone has been present when there has been a gale blowing. It does not
      necessarily prove that under these circumstances there is actually more ozone
      in the air ; for it must be borne in mind that if the amount of ozone in a
       cubic foot of air were always the same, still if today 300 cubic feet of air
      only occupies the same space of time in passing through the box as 100 cubic
      feet occupied yesterday, we shall have more ozone apparently shown today
      than yesterday. Then again, as chemical action increases with an increase
      of heat, it is also manifest that the same amount of ozone passing through
      the box at a temperature of 60° would necessarily darken the paper more
      than the same amount at a temperature of 40°.

           It is quite clear that certain corrections are requisite in order to find the

      actual amount of ozone.

  3rd. With regard to the pressure of the air, there is a striking difference be-
      tween the readings of the ozonometer with a high or low barometer. Takin°-
      the four days in each month during the past year on which the mean
      pressure was greatest, the average amount of ozone was 1-2, whilst on takin°-
     the same number of days when the barometer was lowest, the mean was
     44, or nearly four times as much ; four years' observations give very similar
     results. The mean maximum pressure for the whole twelve months of the
     four years is 30-22 inches, the mean ozone being 1-0; the mean minimum
      pressure for the like period is 29-18 inches, the mean ozone being 3-2.

              With the barometer at 28^ inches the mean ozone is 5-7

                                                                   }>

ditions of the atmosphere. By the catalytic action of phosphorus on atmospheric

air, a gaseous body (superoxide of hydrogen) is formed, which is analogous to, if
not the same as, atmospheric ozone, and it can be detected by the same tests. The
author has found, by his visual tests, that phosph one ozone is developed only -when
the phosphorus is luminous.

 On the Nomenclature of Organic Compounds. By "W. Odling, M.B., F.R.S.

   Admitting the impossibility of establishing a thoroughly systematic nomencla-
ture in organic chemistry, the author advocated a gradual improvement of that

now in more or less general use, by removing its chief incongruities, and remedying
its more striking inconveniences. He showed, by many examples, how great an

improvement might be effected by an introduction of very few and trivial changes.

 On the Essential Oils and Resins from the Indigenous Vegetation of Victoria.
                                    By J. W. Osborne.

   The indigenous trees and shrubs of the colony of Victoria belong for the most
part to the genera Eucalyptus and Melaleuca, which grow in great luxuriance over

the greater part of the Australian continent. In no other localities are oil-bearing
plants to be found in the same abundance, especially such as attain to arborescent
growth, nor is the yield of oil as great elsewhere. The thirty-five samples sub-
mitted to the Section are identical with these exhibited in the Victorinn Depart-
ment of the International Exhibition. They were distilled by the Exhibitors, at
the request and under the auspices of Dr. Ferdinand Midler, the Government
Botanist of Victoria, to whose great talents and untiring energy the colony is

largely indebted. In the present case the rigorous accuracy of the specific name of
each specimen may be accepted on his authority.

   The author, as Juror, examined the essential oils and resins with respect to their

technological value, for the Victorian Commissioners.
   Those from the genera Eucalyptus and Melaleuca (nineteen different oils) resem-

ble the Cajuput of India, Melaleuca leucadendron. In smell and taste they are
generally more camphoraceous, partaking sometimes of the odour of oil of lemon.
Their colour is for the most part a pale yellow, sometimes colourless, and occasion-
ally green. Their specific gravity, in the samples submitted to the Section, varies
from 0-881 to 0940, the average heing about 0-910. These oils have all two boil-
ing-points, the lower being, generally speaking, about 325^, and the other about 40°

higher.

   They burn well in suitable lamps, and are not dangerous, as they are ignited with
difficulty. As solvents for resinous bodies, they surpass most liquids of the k'nd,

and form varnishes, attacking with readiness the intractable Kauric gum of New

Zealand. The yield from individuals of the series is sometimes exceedingly large,
E. amygdalina giving by distillation of 100 lbs. of its green leaves and branchlets,
three pints of oil ; E. oleosa, 20 ounces ; E. sideroxylon, 16 ounces ; M. linarifolia,

28 ounces, &c. It is estimated that 12,000,000 acres of the colony of Victoria are
covered with myrtaceous vegetation of this description, some of it of a shrubby
character, densely covering vast tracts (E. oleosa, F. M. ; E. dumosa, Cunn. ; E,

fragrant perfume distilled from the blossoms of the Pittosporum undulatum. Also
a heavy oil from the bark of the Atherosperma moschatum, possessed of powerful
medicinal properties.

   The resins and gum-resins include several obtained from the genus Eucalyptus,
which are powerfully astringent, and more or less soluble in water. Also one from
the Callitris verrucosa and cupressiformis of Northern Victoria, the sandarac of
commerce ; one from the Xanthorrhcea australis, a balsamic resin containing ben-
zoic acid, and resembling dragon's-blood ; together with some true gums from the
genus Acacia, which is well represented in the Australian colonies.

cular names as far as known.

Details of a Photolithographic Process, as adopted by the Government of

        Victoria, for the publication of Maps. By J. W. Osborne.

The author referred to his having read a paper upon this subject before the Royal

Society of Victoria, in November 1859, his process naving been previously patented

in theColony on the 1st of September, 1859. The process had then been adopted

by the Government, and had come info active use in the Department of Lands and

Survey at Melbourne. By its means many hundreds of maps had been published,

of a quality and for a price which left nothing to be desired. The Victorian

Government had recently erected an office, the design and arrangements of which

were admirably adapted for the prosecution of this description of work. To pro-

duce a photolithographic copy with or without reduction, the original map or en-

graving was extended upon an upright board, and by the help of a camera placed

Aopposite, a negative of it was taken.  sheet of paper was now prepared by coat-

ing one of its surfaces with a solution of gelatine in water, to which a certain pro-

portion of bichromate of potash and liquid albumen had been added. The surface

thus prepared, after it had dried in a dark and warm room, was sensitive to the

chemical action of light, and the next operation was to expose to the sun's rays a

suitable piece of it, in an ordinarypressure frame, under the negative already obtained.

The positive photographic print thus produced was inked all over with lithographic

re-transfer ink, and was then placed floating upon boiling water, with its inky side
upwards and unwetted. After a short time the gelatine would be found to have

softened and swelled under the ink, save where the light had acted, the organic

matter upon such places having suffered a peculiar change. Another effect of the

boiling water was to coagulate the albumen in the fllm. When sufficiently soaked,

the superfluous ink was removed by means of a sponge, and the result was a pho-

tographic print in greasy ink ; inasmuch as the latter substance adhered firmly to

all the unsoftened, or, in other words, the altered parts of the gelatinous coating.

It would also be found that the delineation thus obtained was upon a smooth sur-

face of coagulated albumen. Boiling water in abundance was now poured over the

paper, after which it was carefully dried. The photographic print thus produced, in
consequence of the greasy ink upon the positive portions of the work, was capable of
being transferred to stone by the printer, by the well-known mechanical process ; and
from stones thus prepared, impressions could be pulled in the lithographic press.

   Numerous specimens were exhibited to the Section.

       On the Manufacture of Hydrocarbon Oils, Paraffin, Sfc, from Peat.
                                  By B. H. Paul, Ph.D.

   The author described the results that had been obtained at some works lately
erected under his direction in the island of Lewis, N.B. Tbe peat of that locality
was described as a peculiarly rich bituminous variety of moimtain peat, yielding
from five to ten gallons of rehned oils and paraffin from the ton. The results ob-
tained at these works were contrasted with those obtained at the works of the Irish
Peat Company some years ago, where the produce of oil was not more than two
gallons from the ton of peat. This difference in the produce was ascribed, in a great
degree, to the improper mode of working adopted at tbe Irish works. One of the
most important points dwelt upon was tbe necessity of regarding the hydrocarbon
oils and paraffin as the only products that woidd afford a profit in working peat
and the failure of the Irish works was attributed to the attempt to obtain other pro-
ducts which could only be regarded as waste, and not worth working, unless the
oils and paraffin were obtainable in a remunerative amount from the peat.

          On the Decay and Preservation of Stone employed in Building.
                                 By B. H. Paul, Ph.D.

   The causes and nature of the decay of building-stone were described as being
both chemical and mechanical, and varying according to the nature of the stone and
the conditions to which it was exposed. The various methods which have been
proposed for the preservation of stone from decay were described in detail ; the
author considering, from a chemical point of view, that none of them presented any
probability of success in effecting the desired residt, and that the discovery of an
efficient and practicable means of preventing the decay of stone, especially in towns,

still remains to be made.

On the Artificial Formation of Populine, and on a new Class of Organic
         Compounds. By T. L. Phlpson, M.B., Ph.D., F.C.S. 6fc.

The interesting substance popidine was extracted in 1830 by Braconnot from

the mother-liquors which had deposited salicine when the latter was obtained from

the leaves and the bark of the popn ar tree (Poptdxs trenmla). It was submitted

to an important series of experiments by Piria in 1852, who found, among other

--interesting facts, that, in a variety of circumstances, populine split up into benzoic

acid and salicine :

            H HO = H HO + H+C4o 22 i6
                       2  C 11       5s             C O u2e 18
                                                 ,                                                           .

            Populine.     Benzoic acid,             Salicine.

  It occurred to me that salicine and benzoic acid might be combined so as to
reproduce populine. And this I find to be the case : when equal equivalents of

salicine and benzoic acid are dissolved in alcohol and the liquid evaporated to about
half its bulk, magnificent acicular crystals of populine are obtained, some of which

in my experiments measured nearly an inch in length. For every 100 parts of

salicine must be taken 43 parts of benzoic acid. Or foj 100 parts of salicine, 53-5

parts of benzoate of soda and a sufficient quantity of diluted sulphuric acid to satu-

rate the soda of the benzoate ; alcohol is then added, and the sulphate of soda sepa-

rated by filtration. By evaporating the solution long needles of populine are

obtained :  H + H H +=O OOC u e 4 C u26 18 (C*> 22 16 2 HO).

            Benzoic acid. Salicine.  Crystallized populine.

The properties of the populine thus formed are precisely those of the natural
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  51

product. Its peculiar taste, acrid and sweet at the same time, reminding us of the
taste of liquorice, is characteristic. With sulphuric acid it takes a red colour;
distilled with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid it yields salicylous acid. It
is more soluble in water and alcohol than salicine. It is curious also to note that
in this combination the salicine has lost its bitter taste, which renders it probable
that populine is in reality a compound of benzoic acid, sugar, and saligenine ; for,
when boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, it breaks up into benzoic acid, sugar, and
saliretine (saligenine minus 2 equivs. of water) :

                            HC U 8 0* Saligenine.
                             HC O12 10 10 Sugar.
                            HC U O6 4 Benzoic acid.

                           HC40 M O18 Populine.

As soon as the sugar is set free, it takes up 4 equivs. of water and passes into grape-

Hsugar (C 12 u O u).

  The molecule of populine is therefore a very complex one. And these kinds of

compounds may, perhaps, be compared to the combinations of two or more salts in

mineral chemistry, for instance to alum, if we compare the sulphate of alumina to

the benzoic acid, the sulphate of potash to the saligenine, and the 24 equivalents of
water to the sugar.

   But I have also foimd that citric acid and tartaric acid, when taken in equivalent

proportions, dissolved in water, and the solution evaporated, enter into chemical

combination. It is well known that these acids crystallize in two different systems,
the forms of which are incompatible, and by evaporating a mixture of them we
should obtain two kinds of crystals if no combination took place. But I find that

they combine and produce one kind of crystal only, namely, long prismatic needles,

and when one of these crystals is taken and analysed, it is found to be composed of

citric and tartaric acids.
   This combination of citric and tartaric acids is probably only one example of

a new class of organic compounds, similar in some respects to populine, which
remains to be studied. Already Prof. Williamson has shown that the different
acetones may be made to combine so as to produce complex acetones. Thus when
valerate and acetate of lime are distilled together in equivalent proportions, we
obtain acetovalerone, a compound of acetone and valerone, and so on for the others.

   It is highly probable from what precedes that other organic acids besides benzoic
acid may be made to combine with salicine ; likewise that other bitter principles

analogous to salicine may be combined with organic acids to produce substances

similar to populine.

 On the Existence of Aniline in certain Fungi which become Blue in contact tvitli

            the Air, Sfc. By T. L. Phipson, M.B., Ph.D., F.C.8. <$fc.

  Two years ago I published in Brussels a memoir upon the Boleti which become
blue when cut with a knife, and upon the formation of colouring matters in fungi*.

In this paper I called attention to a remarkable set of reactions occurring in nature

when one substance causes atmospheric oxygen to assume the state of ozone and to

act upon another substance in contact with the first, a fact originally pointed out
by Prof. Schcenbein. In this paper also I endeavoured to show that the production
of the blue colour observed when Boletus cyanescem, Boletus luridm, &c. are cut
with a knife and exposed to the air, is owing to the existence of aniline in the sap

of these fungi.

   Nothing is easier than to extract the principle to which these Boleti owe their
remarkable property of taking a deep, though fugitive, blue colour when their in-
ternal tissue is put in contact with the air. But it is not easy to obtain it perfectly

pure, and very difficult to obtain it in any quantity, as its power of producing the

blue colour is so great that a very minute proportion suffices to colour the entire

Whentissue of a large Boletus.  one of these fungi is treated with ordinary alcohol,

the aniline it contains is dissolved with several other matters, which, however, do

not prevent the ordinary characteristic reactions of aniline. This principle appears

to be present in the fungus as acetate of aniline. I have not extracted it in suffi-

cient quantity or of sufficient purity to submit it to more than a qualitative exami-

nation : but the data which follow will, I think, sufficiently establish the point in

question. I give here, in the form of a Table, the characters observed, of the prin-

ciple extracted from these Boleti, together with the characters of aniline. In every

case the result is identical for both :

   These characters suffice, I think, to establish the identity of the principle con-
tained in Boletus luridus and B. cyanescens with the artificial alkaloid aniline ex-
tracted from coal-tar. It is the first time that aniline has been shown to exist in

nature.

   The manner in which the blue colour is produced when the tissue of these Boleti
is broken and exposed to the air is easily accounted for : I have shown in several

of my former papers (loc. cit. p. 1) that when oxygen reacts upon organic matters

in nature, it is generally in the state of ozone. The presence of some ferment in
the tissue of plants, and in contact with the substance which combines with the

oxygen, appears to be the cause of this remarkable modification of oxygen. Thus,

when an apple is cut in two halves, the brown colour which ensues is owing to
the action of ozone (as ma}' be proved by directly applying the tests for ozone), and
the ozone is produced by the influence of the ferment : for ordinary oxygen will
not produce the coloration ; and when the ferment is destroyed by boiling, the colour
is not produced either. In the case of the Boleti, the aniline which exists in their

tissue as a colourless salt, turns blue under the influence of ozone produced in con-

tact with the ferment present in the fungus ; for when this ferment is destroyed by
boiling, no coloration ensues when the tissue of the fungus is broken and exposed

to the air.

   It is well known that some salts of aniline, when exposed for some time to the
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                           53

air, take a delicate rose-colour. This accounts for the beautiful rose tint not un-
frequently remarked upon the stalks of those Boleti which contain aniline.

Analysis of the Diluvial Soil of Brabant, §c, known as the Limon de la

          Hesbaye. By T. L. Phipson, M.B., Ph.D., F.C.S. $e.

   The curious geological formation known as the Limon de la Hesbaye, which ex-
tends from the Seine to the Rhine, traversing Belgium from east to west, where it

covers the whole of the district of Hesbaye, a great part of Brabant, Hainault, and

Flanders, is exceedingly remarkable for its fertility. "It is to this deposit," says

D'Omalius d'Halloy, "that we may attribute the richness of the most fertile countries

of Belgium." It extends also over Picardy, stretching from the Seine to the other
side of the Rhine, and is everywhere characterized by its great fertility and the

excellence of the vegetable mould to which it gives birth by culture. No fossils
have as yet been discovered in this deposit; it ranks among the "modern," "post-

tertiary," or " diluvial " formations of geologists ; and there exist, on different por-

tions of the globe, similar modem deposits equally interesting in an agricultural

point of view.

   I have submitted this remarkable deposit to analysis, and its composition shows
that though the Limon de la Hesbaye contains upwards of 90 per cent, of pure

sand, yet the chemical ingredients necessary to form a fertile soil are present in it
in notable quantity ; besides which, its porosity, which allows water to pass slowdy
through it and admits the ingress of atmospheric oxygen, is an important condi-

tion of fertility.

  When pulverized and exposed to the air, the Limon de la Hesbaye dries com-
pletely, but when in mass it retains its moisture for some time. When seen in

mass it is brownish yellow, becoming of a lighter colour when dry, and giving a
whitish-yellow powder when pulverized. Its density is about 2-00 (water=l-00)

it has a straight fracture, possessing a certain compactness, though it can be pul-

verized in the hands without much difficulty.
  The sample analysed by me was taken in the neighbourhood of Brussels : I was

careful in selecting it from the centre of a stratification about 2 yards thick, and
where it had never been submitted to cultivation. The result obtained is as

                 On Hypobronious Acid. By Prof. H. E. Roscoe.

   Professor Roscoe communicated to the Section the results of an investigation
upon the lowest oxide of bromine, hypobronious acid, which had been made in the
laboratory of Owens College, Manchester, by Mr. William Dancer. Balard in
1826 mentions the formation of a colourless bleaching salt formed by the action of

bromine upon the alkalies, and since that date many chemists have indicated the

presence of such a body, but it has not been prepared in a pure state or analysed.
Mr. Dancer has succeeded in preparing the aqueous acid in a pure state, and has
examined its chief properties and determined its composition. If bromine-water
and nitrate-of-silver solution be brought together, one-half the bromine is precipi-
tated as bromide of silver, whilst the other half remains in solution as hypobronious

acid (BrO HO). The aqueous acid may be obtained by distillation at 30° C. in
vacuo, but decomposes into bromine and oxygen at 100° C. The aqueous acid may

likewise be prepared by shaking bromine-water together with oxide of mercury,
and distilling ;';; vacuo ; in this case half the bromine forms the bleaching compound.
Hypobronious acid unites with the alkalies, and forms salts analogous in smell and
bleaching properties to the corresponding hypochlorites. Owing to the ease with
which this compound splits up into bromine and oxygen, it was found impossible
to prepare the hypobronious anhydride by any of the methods used for the isolation
of the corresponding chlorine compound.

         Description of a rapid Dry -Collodion Process. By T. Sutton.

  A rapid dry-collodion process, by which dry plates can be prepared as sensitive as

with wet collodion, has more than any other problem interested photographers.

By the wet process, the negative has to be finished on the spot. The rapidity of

this dry process depends upon the effect of bromine in dry collodion. In the
Daguerreotype process a silver plate iodized is extremely insensitive, but when sub-
mitted to the fumes of bromine it is increased a hundredfold. In the wet, but not
in this process, nitrate of silver is required, which is the element of instability.
In preparing, therefore, rapid dry-collodion plates, bromo-iodized collodion must be
used. But the image produced thus is extremely thin and superficial ; it is there-
fore necessary to apply to the film a coating of some organic substance, in order

to darken parts of the negative. Many substances have been tried for this purpose,
but none produce so good an effect as gum-arabic. The paper concluded with the

operations required for this process.

        Address to the Geological Section by J. Beete Jtjk.es, M.A., F.B.S.
It is now thirty-two years ago since I first, when a " freshman " of this Univer-
sity, attended the geological lectures of Professor Sedgwick. I had previously
had access to a cabinet of fossils, and had been accustomed to seek for specimens
in nry schoolboy rambles on the hills near Dudley. It may be imagined, therefore,
with what interest I listened to the " winged words " of the Woodwardian Pro-
fessor, which used day after day to delight an audience composed of all ranks of the

University.

    Geology and its kindred sciences did not then, indeed, form any part of our re-

gular course of university studies, and many of the college tutors were so far from

 encouraging our attention to them, that they rather discountenanced it, considering

them as at best useless and probably even dangerous pursuits. With such a man
 as Professor Sedgwick, however, in the Woodwardian chair, whose wit and humour

 delighted, while his eloquence aroused and informed his hearers, the love of the
 science and the knowledge of it could not fail to extend from one year to another.

   The natural sciences are now considered as worthy of study, by those who have

 a taste for them, both in themselves and as a means of mental training and disci-

pline. In my time, however, no other hranches of learning were recognized than

classics and mathematics, and I have with some shame to confess that I displayed
but a "truant disposition " with respect to them, and too often hurried from the tutor's

lecture-room to the river or the field, to enable me to add much to the scanty stores
of knowledge I had brought up with me. Had it not been, then, for the teaching

of Professor Sedgwick in Geology, my time might have been altogether wasted.

But it was not only in the lecture-room that I learnt from him. With that kind-
ness of heart and geniality of disposition which make him as much loved as his
powers cause him to be admired, he was good enough to step down from his high

place as a Professor of the University, and to take some notice of the young under-

graduate whom he saw lingering over the trays of specimens when the lecture
was over, to inquire his name, and to invite him to his table. He subsequently
allowed me to accompany him on some excursions in different parts of England,
and gave me some of those practical lessons in the field, which, as you know, teach

more in three days than can be learnt in months or years in the museum or the lecture-

room. I look back upon these circumstances as those which gave direction to the

whole course of my life, and as the origin of a paternal friendship with which Pro-
fessor Sedgwick has honoured me for so many years, and which it has been my chief

pride to endeavour to deserve. I hope, Ladies and Gentlemen, I may be pardoned

for these few personal allusions ; but amid all the gratification which I must ne-

cessarily feel at the honour which has now fallen upon me, that, namely, of being

called upon to preside, within the walls of my own Alma Mater, over the Geolo-
gical Section of the British Association, it was impossible for me to neglect the

opportunity of acknowledging the debt of gratitude I owe to one of the ruling

spirits of both bodies, and of avowing that my chief claim to occupy this chair
is that I am an old pupil of Professor Sedgwick.

   One of the most obvious difficulties in the way of any person who now under-

takes to preside over this Section is the thought of the contrast that will neces-

sarily arise in the minds of many of you between him and his predecessors. That

I am now occupying the seat that bas been filled by Sedgwick, Buckland, Lyell,

Murchison, Hopkins, De la Beche, Forbes, and so many other illustrious men, may

mywell cause me to doubt  own capability of fulfilling its duties.  One lesson I must

certainly learn, and that is, to endeavour to make up for other deficiencies by atten-

tion and assiduity, and, above all, not to take such an advantage of the position,

as to bring anything of my own before your notice, to the hindrance of others

who may have something to produce that may be more worthy of it. At the end,

then, of this Address, which I will endeavour to make as brief as possible, I shall

consider my own mouth as almost closed for the remainder of the meeting, and shall
endeavour so far to imitate the Speaker of the House of Commons as to say as

little as possible.

myI propose to take for   subject the external features of the earth's surface.

The principal business of Geology is to acquire as accurate a knowledge as we can

of the internal structure of the crust of the earth, and to leam as much as possible

of all the operations by which that structure was originally formed, or by which it

has been subsequently modified. The crust of the earth has always been receiving

accessions to its composition, both from within and from without. In like manner

it has always been subject to modifying influences proceeding both from within and

from without. It is obvious that the external influences act directly upon the

actual surface of the time being. It is equally obvious that the internal influences

can only reach that surface by penetrating through the thickness of the crust.

If, therefore, we ask by what means the present surface of the earth, or, to bring

the problem within more narrow limits, by what means the present surface of any

of our dry lands, has been produced, we shoidd naturally conclude that it owes its

form to the external influences that have been brought to bear directly upon it,

rather than to the indirect action of those deep-seated agencies, which can only

reach it through an unknown thickness of solid rock.

I believe this conclusion to be a true one. It is, however, by no means the idea

which is commonly entertained, even by many geologists, while those who are not

geologists are always inclined to refer all the more striking features of the surface
--56 report 1862.

of the earth to the direct action of convulsive force proceeding: from the interior,
rather than to their true source in the gentle, gradual, silent influence of the
" weather," continued through an indefinite period of past time.

   I have heard even educated men speak of the correspondence in the chalk cliffs

of the opposite sides of the Straits of Dover, as evidence in favour of the notion that

England had been separated from France by the tearing open of those straits by what
they called some " great convulsion of nature." There is hardly a description to be

--found in any book, of any deep and narrow valley or mountain gorge especially

if the precipices on each side of it show entering and re-entering angles, and rock's

--that were obviously once continuous across the gap, but what its formation is un-

hesitatingly attributed to this vague imaginary force, a "convulsion of nature." Nay,
I have even heard the existence of broad valleys over an anticlinal arch, such, for
instance, as the valley of the Weald, attributed to the eftect of the gaping of the
rocks at the surface, consequent on the upward flexure of the beds. Mythical
powers of disturbance are called into existence with as bold a personification as the
B/a and Kpdros of the poet, and with even less warrant for their existence.

   It seems to me, therefore, that the time is come when geologists should study a
little more closely this problem of the mode of production of the surface of the
land, and determine exactly the method of the formation of those variations in its
outline which we call mountains, hills, table-lands, clifis, precipices, ravines, glens,

valleys, and plains.

   Few men, perhaps, ever pause to inquire into the origin of a great plain ; never-
theless the question may well be put, and it is one which deserves an answer.
Some plains are doubtless the result of original formation. They are level and flat,
because the beds beneath the surface are horizontal. Even these, however, have
very rarely a surface formed simply by the last-deposited beds. The actual surface

is one that has been formed by the erosion and removal of more or less of the
uppermost beds, and the production of undulations formed by the act of cutting

down into the beds below. This erosion or denudation has even in many such
cases gone to the length of entirely removing a much greater thickness than we

should at first suspect, the present surface being one that has been laid bare by

that removal.

   In all cases where the beds below the surface are not strictly horizontal, or do
not accurately coincide as to their " lie " with the form of the surface, it is obvious
that the plain must be one of denudation.

   Suppose we take the great plain on which we now are, and which stretches
from Cambridge far into Lincolnshire. The hills which rise from it towards the

east are formed by the escarpment of the Chalk, the beds of which terminate abruptly
at that escarpment, and allow the clays which lie beneath the Chalk to come up to
the surface and spread beneath the plain. The hills rising to the west of the plain,
on the other hand, are formed of the Oolites, the beds of which lie below these clays
and rise gently from beneath the plain, and themselves terminate in an escarpment

still further west.

   There can be no reasonable doubt that the whole thickness of the Chalk and the

beds below it once spread manv miles to the westward of their present boundaries.
The little chalk-capped monticide of the Castle Hill, at the western end of the
town of Cambridge, and the hills near Madingley show that the Chalk was once
continuous that far, at all events, from the Gogmagogs; and, had still higher ground
been left by the denudation still further west, that would in like manner have

been capped by the bottom beds of the Chalk.
   The hill on which Ely stands is, I believe, an outlier of the Lower Greensand,

the general mass of which crops out some miles to the eastward ; and other hills
rising from the plain will in like manner be found to have their summits capped
by beds, apparently horizontal, but in reality dipping at a very gentle angle to the
eastward, so as to ultimately cut the surface of the plain in that direction and then
sink beneath it. All such outliers are clear proof that the beds formerly extended

over the intervening spaces, and show us that the rocks now left in the ground are

only a portion of those that were originally deposited.
   The great plain of the Fens, then, is one of denudation, its surface being one that
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  57

is now bare in consequence of the removal from above it* of a thickness of
many hundred feet of Chalk, and of other beds below the Chalk. But this reason-
ing may be carried out with respect to the whole of the flat lands of England and
the British Islands. The great central plain of Ireland, for instance, stretching from
Dublin Bay to C4alway Bay, with an average elevation of less than 300 feet above

the sea, has immediately beneath it abruptly undulating beds of Carboniferous

limestone, rising up at all angles, and dipping in all directions. The most level
parts of the surface sometimes cut horizontally across the most contorted and highly
inclined beds. The small isolated hills scattered here and there about the plain
are formed sometimes of beds of Old Bed Sandstone that rise up from beneath the
bottom of the Limestone, and sometimes of beds of Coal-measures which rest upon

the top of it. It is here abundantly evident, then, that the internal forces of dis-

turbance which have bent the beds from their original horizontality into so many
curves, and broken them by so many dislocations, had nothing at all to do with
the production of the present surface, which has been formed across all these bent
and Droken beds after the disturbances had ceased.

   But, in fact, the very first glance at a geological map of a flat country, if there
be two or more colours on it representing conformable groups of stratified rocks, is
"ust as good a proof of this vast denudation as the most elaborate reasoning. The

Iast-deposited group of beds would of course conceal all those beneath it; it would be
represented by one uniform colour. Let the internal forces bend, or tilt, or break it
in any fashion you like, they cannot of themselves remove a particle of it. It will

still lie over all those on which it was originally deposited, and the map would show
the one colour only, unless we go the length of supposing that a piece of the crust
of the earth could be tossed over like a pancake, and laid down again with its bot-
tom upwards.

    I have taken the case of a plain in the first instance, because it is obvious that

if we arrive at the conclusion that many plains are low and level because moun-

tainous masses of rock have been removed from above their present surface, it will
be easy for us to recognize the proofs of denudation in the hills and mountains, on
whose flanks the obvious marks of it are still left.

  A little reflection will show us that the outcrop of a bed is always a proof of

denudation, for the present surface cannot possibly be the original termination, not

only of that particular bed, but of all the beds above it. When then a succession

of beds crop out rapidly one after another, as they always do in all hill-ranges and

mountain-chains, we cannot escape from the conclusion that the existing surface

has been formed by the removal of the former extension of the beds. This is the
inevitable conclusion, whether the surface be horizontal and the beds below it in-

clined, or the beds be horizontal and the surface inclined, or the surface slope one

way and the beds dip another, or there be any kind of discordance between the
" lie " of the beds and the form of the surface of the ground. The only possible

 escape from this conclusion would be in the case where a succession of beds had
been deposited on a slope, and had never been covered by any other deposit. This,
 however, is a case that could only occur in very recently formed rocks, and cannot
 apply to the outcrop of beds on the flanks of hills or mountains, where the surface

 of the ground itself has a high inclination.
    In such situations the only escape from the conclusion that the surface was formed

 by denudation would be, proof that the undulations of the surface were exactly fol-
 lowed by the undidation of the beds below it, and, in fact, that the very same bed
 was everywhere foimd to be the one immediately below the surface.

    If we except Volcanos or "Mountains of Ejection," all other hills and mountains

 are either caused by the removal of the rocks which once surrounded them, or have
 suffered from the removal of those that once spread over them. The first kind of
hills have simply been left high, while the surrounding ground has been worn down
 to a low level about them. In the second kind, the rocks composing them have,
 indeed, been thrust up from beneath by internal force to a much greater elevation
 than those same rocks have in the surrounding area, and their height is due entirely

    * In this general statement the few feet of peat, or the little banks of drift gravel and
 sand which have been subsequently deposited on or grown over the plain, are, of course,

 disregarded.
--58 report 1862.

to that upward tilting, vast masses of once superincumbent beds having been removed
from above them. These hills are high, not in consequence of, but in spite of de-
nudation. I have elsewhere proposed to call the first kind " MUs of circumdenu-
dation," and the second "hills of uptilting." To the latter class belong all the
great mountain-chains of the world, and most of the smaller ones.

   It may be taken as an invariable rule, that, as we approach all mountain-chains

formed by uptilting, the beds rise towards them, and end successively at the sur-
face lower and lower beds still rising up, until the lowest of all appear in the

                        ;

heart of the mountains, where they are often reared up into the loftiest peaks.
True as is this general statement, it is only generally true. The great groups of
rocks thus rise successively one from beneath another ; but this general rise is often
complicated by numerous folds and reduplications, by great longitudinal fractures,
or by complex flexures.

   The geological axis of a mountain-chain runs along the line where the lowest
group of beds rises to the sm-face. The geographical axis may be said to run along
that dominant crest which forms the watershed of the chain. But it by no means
follows that these two axes are coincident, that the lowest group of beds is always
confined to the line of watershed, or even that the loftiest peaks and summits rise
from that crest. The geological axes are dependent solely on the internal forces
of elevation ; if, therefore, the geographical axes do not coincide with them, it shows

at once that they are independent of those forces ; in other words, that the great
external features have not been caused by the direct action of internal movement.

The position of the geological axes of mountain-chains has, however, been often

--erroneously placed, from the tendency to refer them to any great masses of granite

or other plutonic rocks that may show themselves, a reference which is more often

erroneous than correct.
   All mountain-chains of uptilting tell the same story, that if the internal forces

of disturbance and elevation had acted alone, without any external action of denu-
dation, and if they had acted without it to the same extent which they have with

it (supposing that possible), the mountain-chains would have been many times more
lofty than they are. I say "supposing that possible," because it appears to me that

the elevation of the lowest rocks might never have proceeded to the same extent,
if the internal force had not been gradually relieved of some of the external weight

which it had to lift. However that may be, we see now that the lowest beds

which appear at the surface, about the geological axis of a mountain-chain, clip
on either hand beneath an ever-increasing thickness of superincumbent rock, as

we recede from the axis. All the rocks which have been affected by the same

action of disturbing force must have stretched unbroken across the disturbed district,
before the disturbance commenced; for the lowest rocks appear at the surface
now, not in consequence of the flexure or fracture of those that were above them,
but in consequence of their removal. That removal could not have taken place
prior to the internal disturbance, unless we assume the existence of a deep hole or
trough of erosion along the space where the mountain-chain was subsequently thrust
upwards. The removal of the bent or broken beds, then, must have taken place
either during the action of disturbance or subsequently to its termination. In
either case it was an external action, the result, in fact, of moving water, which

slowly wore away and earned off so many square miles or, as in some cases, so
many hundreds or thousands of square miles of rock, so many thousands of feet in
thickness. The internal forces operated simply by lifting up the rocks to within

the region of the denuding influence, and they have only produced that indirect
effect upon the features of the surface which results from their having brought
up to different levels, and placed in various positions, masses of rock of various
hardness and constitution, on which the forces of erosion and transport have had a

corresponding variety of effect, when they reached them.
   I believe that all our uptilted mountain-chains have thus grown by a very slow

and gradual growth, the internal force thrusting upwards what the external agen-
cies always tended to wear down.

   The investigation of the nature and effects of the mechanical forces that have
acted on the crust of the earth from the interior has been undertaken by many
eminent philosophers, by none with more acuteness and profundity than by our pre-
                                                                                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.   59

sent General Secretary, Mr. W. Hopkins, who is so distinguished an ornament of

this Universitjr. To the correctness of the mathematical reasonings employed in

these researches no exception is of course to be taken, even by those who may
withhold their assent from some of the conclusions arrived at. I profess my in-

capacity to engage in the discussion of mathematical problems. Nevertheless,

it has sometimes occurred to me to suppose that, however sound and legitimate
may be the conclusions thus drawn from the premises assumed, they may still he

imperfect or inadequate as conceptions of the truth, in consequence of the incom-

pleteness of the assumptions on which the}' are based. I shall not venture, even

by a guess, to attempt to supply this defect. I only wish to regard the question

as still an open one, thinking it possible that some condition or some agency may

have been hitherto omitted from the speculation, of which no one has as yet, per-

haps, formed even a conception. The researches already made may be admirable

guides in all future investigations, and most useful in clearing the way for them
but it may nevertheless be dangerous to take the conclusion as so far established as

to render future investigation unnecessary.

  There is one line of research, however, in pursuing which we may feel sure of
the ground on which we tread, and that is the observation of occurrences which
take place before our eyes, and of structures which each one may see and examine

for himself.

  We have, in Earthquakes and Yolcanos, the external symptoms of the action of

the earth's internal forces. What they do now, we may feel sure they were able

to do formerly                                                                      and we have no right to assume  that they ever did either more or
                                                                                 ;

less within a given period than they have done during historic times.

Volcanos drill holes through the crust of the earth, and eject lava and ashes

through these holes. These holes are often arranged in lines, as if they were con-

nected with linear cracks in the earth's crust.

Earthquakes jar and shake the earth's crust, throw its surface into transient

waves, and cause sometimes cracks and open fissures to appear at that surface.

The largest of these fissures, however, are rarely more than a few miles in length

and a few yards in width, and they appear rarely to leave any permanent traces on

the surface, or to give rise to any of its more striking features. No one has ever

yet pointed to any valley or any glen, still less to any river-course, as having been

entirely caused by the gaping of the surface during any known earthquake, and in-

dependently of subsequent erosion by running water.

   Mr. Mallet's researches have given us the means of calculating the depth at

which the impulse of an earthquake may originate. This depth seems to be always

proportional to the extent of the surface affected, from which it is obvious that in

many cases a very considerable thickness of the external envelope of the earth

must have been traversed by these movements. Supposing them to have a local

origin, and to be caused by, or to be accompanied by, any considerable disturbance,

either of flexure or fracture, in the solid or quasi-solid rocks at or about the centre

of origin, it seems necessarily to follow that the amount of disturbance must lessen
as we recede from that centre, in proportion to the thickness and extent of the
matter over which it is diffused. The tremblings and undulations, then, and the

surface-cracks and fissures produced by earthquakes are probably only the slight

external indications of more intense but more local disturbance below. Great open

fissures and gapings of the surface could only, as it appears to me, be caused by

disturbances originating at a comparatively slight depth, where it is difficult to

imagine any cause for them, and where, as a matter of fact, great disturbances never

do seem to originate.

In addition to the more convulsive movements of the shocks, permanent eleva-

tion and depression of the surface take place during earthquakes, and also to an
equal if not greater extent by a slow gradual movement, unaccompanied by earth-

quakes, and therefore not perceptible to our senses. These risings and sinkings of
the surface are evidently the result of the upward or downward movement of the

whole thickness of the earth's crust, whatever that thickness may be.
  Resting on considerations such as these, thus hastily sketched out, I am inclined

to be bold enough to dispute the physical possibility, or at all events to deny the

actual occurrence, at any time, of such surface manifestations of internal force as

could give rise to what have been called " craters of elevation," u valleys of eleva-
tion" or any other large openings of the surface of the ground. I would go even
further than this, and hesitate to believe that any high inclination or great con-

tortion had ever been imparted to any beds at, or close to, the surface *. I believe
all such disturbed positions to have been acquired by a slow creeping movement,

the result of the combination of great force acting against almost, but not quite,

equally great superincumbent pressure, and therefore at a correspondingly great

depth," and that, ay the very constitution of the interior of the earth, such great

force could not be brought to bear upon any mere point or line of the surface.
   The rocks thus disturbed ultimately arrive at the surface, because they have

been laid bare by the stripping off of veil after veil of covering, by the external

--erosive forces acting over the upraised area upraised either during the disturbance,

or by a subsequent action of elevation of a broader and more equable character.

These same combined actions, still further carried out, ultimately bring to the sur-

face the Metamorphosed Schists, which had been deeply buried by the converse

actions of depression and deposition, as well as the granitic masses, which, pro-

ceeding from the interior, slowly worked their way upwards to a certain height,

but cooled and consolidated before they were able to approach the surface as it

existed at the time of their intrusion.

No one can study a mountainous district, in which the rocks have been greatly

bent and broken, with the same care and attention that has been bestowed by the

Geological Survey on the mountains of the British Islands, without perceiving that

the external features, whether of hill or valley, do not depend on the frangibility of
the rocks, but on their relative power of resistance to erosive action. The hard

siliceous rocks, or those best adapted to resist the chemical and mechanical action

of water, form the prominences ; the softer or more soluble rocks form the valleys

and low grounds. The upward or anticlinal curves in the beds, over which, if any-
where, external gaping fissures would be formed, are at least as often marked

by the occurrence of hills and ridges over them as of valleys, the external feature

depending altogether on the " weatherable " nature of the rock.
WeThe same reasoning is applicable to great faults and dislocations.
                                                                      are all

familiar with the fact that, of faults that have a dislocation of hundreds or even

thousands of feet, there is often not the least indication at the surface of the ground,

which may be a perfect plain, or may undulate, without any regard to the subter-
ranean structure of the rocks. This seems to me to be strong evidence in favour
of the supposition that these dislocations never did make any great feature at the

surface. The amount of dislocation has been gained foot by foot and inch by inch

below, the movement being so slow as to allow of the surface-irregularity being

always diminished or obliterated as fast as it was formed. If a great disloca-

tion had taken place at once, and an equally great cliff had been formed by it,

surely the traces of such a feature would have been more often preserved than they

are.

   Small cliffs do occur sometimes along the line of a fault, but only when it so hap-

pens that at the present surface of the ground a hard unyielding rock is brought
against a soft and more perishing one ; and the cliff or bank is always in proportion
to the " weatherable " natures of the two rocks, and not to the amount of the dislo-
cation. In like manner, valleys sometimes run along the line of faults, and especially
of large faults, and there is sometimes a sort of proportion between the magnitude
of the dislocation and that of the external feature ; but even in these cases the mag-
nitudes are not of the same kind, the width of the fault being very slight indeed
as compared with the width of the valley. The coincidence is one of direction

only, the original fracture having determined the direction of the subsequent

   * The contortions in the Chalk and the glacial Drift described by Sir C. Lyell, from Messrs.

Forchhammer and Fugaard, as occurring in the Island of Moen in Denmark, show that

this belief must be somewhat modified, and that local flexures and fractures do sometimes
take place even at the surface. If so, then some of those apparent in the Alps and other
recently formed mountain-chains may have also taken place at or near the surface. It is,
however, demonstrable in all these cases that subsequent denudation has acted upon these
areas, though the amount of matter removed may not be so great as the expressions in the

text would imply.

erosive forces, so as to cause them to excavate the valley along that line rather than
any other.

   When, moreover, we examine faults below ground, we find no trace of any wide-
gaping fissures ; the walls of the fault, on the contrary, are jammed tightly against
each other, and show frequent evidence of immense grinding force, proving the

friction of the sides to have been enormous. In hard massive rocks there doubtless
occur open spaces here and there between the walls, "pockets " or " bellies " between
their projecting protuberances, or where they have been partly kept asunder by
fragments detached from the sides. These are often full of crystalline minerals,
and form "mineral veins" below, but seldom, if ever, form valleys or ravines at
the surface.

   If these ideas as to the relative action of the internal and external forces at work
upon the crust of the globe be well founded, it follows that none of the present
features of the surface of the globe have been produced by the direct action of the
internal forces, except volcanic orifices and cones, and that all others have been
produced by the process of external erosion, except such as have been formed by
extemal deposition, like hills of blown sand or alluvial flats and deltas.

   The surfaces of our present lands are as much carved and sculptured surfaces as
the medallion carved from the slab, or the statue sculptured from the block. They

have been gradually reached by the removal of the rock that once covered them,
and are themselves but of transient duration, always slowly wasting from decay.
Even, then, if the internal forces could produce such external features, it can always

be shown that the surface which existed when they operated has long since dis-
appeared, together with, in many cases, vast thicknesses of rock that intervened

between it and the present one.
   It remains to say a few words on the nature of the erosive agencies which form

these surfaces.

   The ocean is the grandest of these. The ceaseless breaking of its waves against
the margin of the land constantly gnaws into and undermines it, and the tides and
currents cany off the eroded materials and deposit them on some part or other of

the ocean-bed. This action is that of a great horizontal planing-machine, always
tending to the production of level surfaces, the cutting power being confined to
the sea-level, while the matter carried off tends to fill up the hollows of the in-

equalities that lie below it. The denuding action of the sea, therefore, produces
" plains of denudation " on the parts it has passed over, and long lines of cliff's or
steep banks along the margin where its influence ceased. It is essential for the
energetic action of the sea that it should be the open sea, where a heavy swell can
roll in upon the land, and where gales of wind can hurl furious waves against it.
In sheltered bays and narrow inlets and fiords its erosive agency becomes compara-
tively small, and in very protected places sinks to nothing.

   "While, then, we look to marine denudation as the cause of wide plains, of long

escarpments, of bold headlands and isolated hills, and of the general outline of
moimtain-chains, and as the remover of the great groups of rock that were con-
tinuous over the area of the mountains before their elevation was commenced, I

believe we err when we attribute to that cause the lesser features by which these

greater ones are themselves modified. The river valleys that traverse the great plains,
the gullies that run down the sides of the hills, the valleys, glens, ravines, and gorges
that furrow the flanks of the mountain-chains, have, I believe, all been caused by
atmospheric agency on the land, while standing above the level of the sea.

   The only case in which the sea tends to produce anything like a valley is that in
which it forms open sounds or straits between islands, where the set of the tides
and currents imparts to it a river-like action. Those depressions in the crest of a
mountain-chain which are called "passes " or " gaps " have doubtless been often
caused by this action, but it is obvious that this ceases as soon as the summit of
the pass once rises above the sea-level and prevents the currents from sweeping-

through it.

   While the ordinary erosive action of the sea is a horizontal one, tending to the
production of plains bordered by cliffs, that of the atmospheric agencies is a ver-
tical one, always tending to the production of furrows, or more or less steep-sided
channels, on all the land exposed to their influence.
--62 report 1862.

Rain falls vertically, and tends to sink vertically into rocks, producing decompo-
Asition in them, both by mechanical and chemical action.
                                                          superficial coating of

greater or less thickness is always thus kept in a state of decay.

In almost all granite districts, the rock beneath the hollows and flatter parts of

the ground will often be found to be decomposed in sitit to a mere sand, so that it

could be dug out with a spade to a depth of several feet. Roundish lumps are

found here and there in this sand, which were the centres of the original blocks

these, as well as the solid rock below, showing every gradation of firmness, from
hard crystalline rock to a mere incoherent sand. I have observed this in granite

districts in all parts of the world, and was much struck with it during the past
summer in the southern part of Brittany, where the deep narrow lanes often showed

both granite and gneiss thus rotten and soft, to a depth sometimes of fifteen or

twenty feet. On the steeper slopes the exposed rock was much less decomposed,
obviously because the particles had been washed down and carried off as fast as they

became completely disintegrated.

Hard limestones, again, exhibit the effects of the action of the rain in the numerous

open fissures and caverns that are always found in them, the water here having

dissolved the rock and carried it off in solution, as if it were so much salt or sugar.

The fantastic forms and honeycombed surfaces of all limestone crags attest the

same action. In baring the surface of a limestone quarry where the beds are in-

clined at any considerable angle, they are often found to be furrowed by rain-channels

one or two feet in depth and several inches in width, the hollows being filled with

Athe finest earth.  deep covering of mould and turf is no protection against this

action, and perhaps even aids it by contributing an additional dose of acid to the

rain-water.

Even where hard siliceous rocks exhibit a weathered coat of a very slight depth,

a mere skin perhaps of a quarter of an inch thick, as is the case in some Felstones,

still it merely proves that the atmospheric influences cannot affect a great thickness

at any one time, and does not render it impossible that many such weathered coats
may have been formed outside the present surface, and successively removed

altogether by the completion of the process.
   The joints of rocks when first formed are doubtless mere planes of separation,

without any interstice that would allow the insertion of even the thinnest edge of
a knife ; they would be quite insensible to the sight, and woidd perhaps scarcely of

themselves be suflicient to cause the separation of the rock into distinct blocks.

In working deep mines it is sometimes said that the rocks cease to show any
joints at all. The joints, however, doubtless exist, although they are invisible,
while the open joints, such as we see in all rocks near the surface, have been
opened by the "weather" acting along these concealed planes of separation.

   The action of the atmosphere, then (*. e. the chemical action of air and water
and the various gases mingled with them, and their mechanical action, owing both

to their movements of gravity and their expansion and contraction from changes of
temperature), is operative in the gradual destruction of rock, to a much greater
vertical depth beueath the surface than is commonly recognized. Its superficial
action is still greater, and has also, as I believe, generally failed, as yet, in receiving
due appreciation. The rain that falls upon the surface and does not sink beneath
it runs, of course, down the shortest and steepest slopes it can find, and is collected
first into rills, then into brooks and rivulets, and finally passes by rivers to the

sea. This superficial drainage of a country is often augmented and kept up by
springs, which are caused by that part of the water that had sunk beneath the
surface finding its way back to it.

   The natural tendency of running water is to cut its channel deeper, and that at
a rate compounded of the rapidity of the current and the nature of the rock below.
Let any one take the basin of drainage of any great river, and trace it up to its
source, following all its tributaries to their sources, and he will not fail to perceive

that all the varied features of the different channels of this system of running
waters are the result of these two circumstances only. In the mountain glens he

will see those that traverse granite commonly with rounded open forms ; those
that cut through hard slates, or thick horizontal sandstones, are commonly narrow
and precipitous, with jagged cliffs and overhanging ledges, perhaps, jutting from
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  63

the sides of the ravines. He will see the marks of the old cataracts that once
fell over these ledges, but which now are removed to other places, or converted

into mere rapids, or perhaps altogether obliterated by the cutting down and cutting

back of the streams. Torrs and pinnacles will be left here and there, perhaps,

rising up from the bed of the stream, showing the former islets and rocks which

resisted the erosive action better than the parts on each side of them. Where a

softer and more yielding mass of rock occurred, there the glen widens into an open
valley ; the narrowest and most jagged and steep-sided glens are just where the
rocks are most hard and intractable, and best calculated for resisting the chemical
and mechanical action of running water.

   The scale upon which these operations have been carried out does not affect the
nature of the argument. The action has been the same in the miniature glens of
our own mountains and in the grander and more awful abysses that gash the sides
of the Alps, the Andes, and the Himalayas.

   In all cases when the river comes down now, or has formerly come down, in the

form of a glacier, before springing into running water, the ice-mass has of course

scooped out and deepened and widened the valley in its own peculiar fashion.

   When we leave the mountains and come down into the lower lands, where the

rivers wind with a more gentle stream from side to side of broad open valleys,
through wide alluvial flats, still it is to the river that the present form and depth
of the valley are due. Whatever may have been the undulation of the original
surface of marine denudation which determined the course of the primary stream,
the river has long since cut down beneath that surface, and is still occupied in

cutting deeper, so long as it retains any sensible current at all. It effects this by

undermining the bank now on one side and now on the other side of the vallev,

shaving off a little corner here and another there, so that a river not a hundred

yards broad, perhaps, may eventually form a valley of several miles in width.
The obstructions it accumulates from time to time in its own bed constantly

deflect its channel, so that ultimately it visits every part of the valley.

   In many cases the mere deepening of the valley may necessarily widen it also,
since the rocks may be of such a composition, or may lie in such a way, as not to be
able to form a bank of any steepness ; and the materials, therefore, always slip down

towards the bottom of the valley as fast as their bases are cut into.

   It is true that all these processes are infmitesinially slow; but if carried on
through a period of time indefinitely great, it is obvious that it is impossible to
assign a limit to the amount of their results.

   I have for several years been studying the origin of the river-valleys of the
South of Ireland, and have, since the last meeting of this Association, been com-
pelled to arrive at the conclusion that the great limestone plain of the centre of
Ireland has lost a thickness of 300 or 400 feet at least, by the mere action of the

rain that has fallen upon it. As a corollary of this conclusion, I have also been led

--to perceive that the longitudinal and lateral valleys of the Irish mountains and if
--of them, then those of all other mountain-chains of the world are the result of

the action of the water or the ice that has been thrown down on them from the

atmosphere.

   If we take any mountain- chain and its adjacent lowlands, and suppose no rain
to fall upon them for a time, and that all the valleys of whatever description were

filled up, and the sides of the mountains smoothed over from their peaks to their

bases, I believe the surface thus produced would be one representing the limits of
marine denudation ; then let rain begin to fall on such a country, and all the ela-

borate structure of valleys, gorges, glens, and ravines would be produced by it.

   I believe that the lateral valleys are those which were first formed by the drain-
age running directly from the crests of the chains, the longitudinal ones being sub-
sequently elaborated along the strike of the softer or more erodable beds exposed on
the flanks of those chains. I do not, of course, intend to say that any country ever
existed without valleys, since valleys of some kind must commence as soon as the
first peaks of the mountains show themselves above the sea, and must be continued
and extended in proportion to the extent of the land which gradually rises into the
atmosphere. Atmospheric denudation and marine denudation have always been at
work simultaneously upon the different parts of every land in the globe," and their
--64 report 1862.

action may be very complex, so that it is often difficult or impossible to separate the
results of one from those of the other at any particular place. Still I believe we
may generally regard the external form of a mountain-chain as due to marine, and

the valleys within it as the result of atmospheric erosion.
   Most of you will be aware that the views I have thus endeavoured to place be-

fore you are not altogether original : other persons have before now proposed the same

method of explanation of the form of ground. M. Charpentier long ago referred the
origin of the valleys of the Pyrenees to the action of the rivers which traverse
them. Mr. Dana had pointed to the same action as the cause of the wonderful

system of ravines that furrows the sides of the Blue Mountain range in New South

Wales, and of the deep ravines separated by knife-edged ridges which radiate from
the centres of the high islands of the Pacific. I confess, however, that I had, up
to the present year, hesitated to accept this explanation without reserve ; and there-

fore, since I am now convinced of its truth, I am anxious to take the earliest oppor-

tunity of recording that conviction*.

    Mr. Prestwich, in his recent papers read before the Royal Society, has adopted

the hypothesis of the subaerial deepening of the valleys of the Somme and the

Seine, and other river-valleys both in France and England, to account for the for-
mation of the freshwater gravels which he finds on the flanks of those valleys, so
high above the present levels of the rivers or of any possible floods.

   Professor Ramsay has in like manner attributed the formation of the hollows in
which the lakes of Switzerland lie, to the ploughing action exercised on the sub-
jacent rocks by the action of the glaciers, when far more extensive than now. The
formation of lakes lying in " rock-basins," and not formed by the mere stoppage or
damming up of a river, had always been a complete puzzle to me until I read Pro-
fessor Ramsay's paper in the last Number of the Geological Journal (May 1862). I

believe his explanation of their origin to be the true one.
    That he and Mr. Prestwich and myself should all, within the space of the same

twelvemonth, have been compelled to appeal to external atmospheric action as the

only method of explaining the origin of the different surface-phenomena we were
studying, is of itself, I think, good evidence that we are all three pursuing the right

 track in our search after truth.

   At the instant of penning this sentence, I see by a newspaper paragraph that

Dr. Tyndall follows us in his speculations as to the origin of the valleys of the Alpsf

   * Had I not become previously convinced of the extent and power of atmospheric and
river action in consequence of my own observations, all scepticism must have yielded to

the proof of it detailed in the admirable Report by Dr. Newberry on the Geology of the
Colorado River of the West, published by the United States Government at Washington
in 1861. It was only in February 1863 that I saw this work through the kindness of

Dr. Newberry, who himself transmitted to me a copy of it. The beautiful maps and
plates and the numerous woodcuts illustrate the text in a way that puts to shame the
miserable niggardliness of our own Government in such matters ; for here they are either

committed to the red-tape ignorance of mere clerks whose duty it is simply to curtail
expenditure, or to the equally uninstrueted indifference of higher officials in dread of the

well-meant but blundering questioning of some man of figures in the House of Commons,
or still oftener left to the enterprise of some publisher, who lias of course his profit to
make out of the work. An advertisement at the beginning of the American Report shows

 that the Senate of the United States ordered ten thousand extra copies of it to be printed,
five hundred of which were given to the officer commanding the expedition.

    Dr. Newberry shows in his Report that the wonderful canons which traverse much of the

 country of California, and some of which are from 5000 to 6000 feet deep, and only wide
 enough for the waters of the rivers to flow through them, have been cut down by those
 rivers through horizontal and quite undisturbed beds belonging to the Carboniferous,
 Devonian, and Silurian periods into the Granite below, and moreover that wide valleys in
 other parts have also been excavated by the gradual action of atmospheric erosion, leaving
 numerous perpendicular torrs, crags, or pinnacles of rock here and there, all showing the
 same horizontal beds.

   Af subsequent reading of Dr. Tyndall's paper, and of a notice of it afterwards by Pro-

 fessor Ramsay, showed me that Dr. Tyndall was inclined, at the time of writing it, to
 attribute the Alpine valleys too exclusively to the action of glaciers. The valleys must have
 been commenced and many of them almost completed before the glaciers, although the

   As a concluding observation, allow me to remark how curiously the threefold

physical agencies that are in simultaneous operation on the crust of the globe were
typified in the old heathen mythology. The atmosphere which envelopes the land
and rests upon the sea, the ocean which fills up the deeper hollows of the earth's
surface, and the nether-seated source of heat and force that lies beneath the crust
of the earth are each personified in it as a great divinity. If one of the old Greek

poets were to revisit the earth, and clothe these ideas in his own imagery, he would

tell us in sonorous verse of Zeus (or Jupiter), the Clod of the Air, ruling all things

upon the land with his own absolute and pre-eminent power; of Poseidon (or
Neptune) governing the depths of the ocean, but shaking the shores which en-
circle it ; and of Hades (or Pluto), confined to his own dark regions below, tyran-
nizing with all the sternness of a force irresistible by anything which can there

oppose it, but rarely manifesting itself by any open action Avithin the realms of the

other divinities.

   On an Early Stage in the Development of Comatula, and its Palceontological
                   Relations. By Professor Alljtan, M.D., F.R.S.

    The subject of this communication was a small Echinodermatous animal, a single
 specimen of which was obtained by the author on the south coast of Devon,
 where it was found attached to one of the larger Sertularida?, dredged from about
four fathoms' depth. The author regarded it as one of the early stages in the de-
 velopment of Comatula, and though quite distinct from the well-known Pentacrinus
stage of this criuoid, believed that it had been witnessed both by Thompson and
Dujardin, but not correctly described or figured by either of them. It consisted of
a body borne upon the summit of a long jointed stem. The body had the form of
two pyramids placed base to base. The upper pyramid is formed of five triangular
valve-like plates, moveably articulated upon the upper side of the lower pyramid,
and capable of being separated from one another at the will of the animal, so as to
present the appearance of an expanding flower-bud, and again approximated till
their edges are in contact and the original pyramidal form restored. From between
the edges of these plates, long flexile tentaculoid appendages, which must not be
confounded with the permanent arms of Comatula, are protruded in the expanded
state of the animal, and within these is a circle of shorter, more rigid, rod-like ap-
pendages which seem to be moveably articulated to the upper side of the calyx,
immediately round the centre, where it is almost certain that the mouth is placed.
The lower pyramid or proper calyx is mainly formed of five large hexagonal plates,
separated from the summit of the stem by a zone, whose composition out of distinct
plates could not be demonstrated, and having five small tetragonal plates interca-

lated between their upper angles. In assigning their proper value to the several
plates thus entering into the body, the author regarded the lower zone, which rests
immediately on the stem, as simply a metamorphosed joint of the stem itself, while
the verticil of plates, situated immediately above this, is the true basilar portion of
the calyx. The five small intercalated plates are the equivalents of the radialia,
and destined to cany afterwards the true arms of the crinoid ; while the five tri-
angular plates which constitute the sides of the upper pyramid are interradialia.
Professor Allman considered the little animal described in this communication as
of special interest, in the light which it seemed capable of throwing on the real
nature of certain aberrant groups of Crinoidea, such as Haplocrinas, Coccocrinus, &c,
in which the calyx supports a more or less elevated pyramidal roof, composed en-
tirely or in great part of five triangular plates, which find their homologues in the
five sides of the pyramidal roof of the little crinoid which formed the subject of his

paper.

On Bituminous Schists and their Relation to Coal. By Professor Ansied, F.R.S.

   The occurrence of rocks of all geological periods, and in most parts of the world,
containing a sufficient quantity of the mineral hydrocarbon to be worth distilling

present depth, width, and regularity of many of them are doubtless ascribable to glacier

action.

for various economic purposes is well known ; and there are certain cases in which

there is an apparent passage from the shale or schist containing' so large a quantity

bumof these mineral oils as to  like fuel, into true coal, which also sometimes con-

tains a large quantity of hydrogen, and can he distilled for some purposes with ad-

vantage. The chief object of this paper was to direct attention to some of the

rocks known among geologists as bituminous schists.

 --Two deposits of this kind have long been known in France, and have recently

been visited by the author, one between Nantes and Rochelie, in the Bourbon-

Vendee, the other near the town of Autun. The former are called the Feymoreau

schists, and they were distilled with success in 1830 for paraffine oil, other light

burning oils, and lubricating oils, by the method since patented by Mr. Young.

Owing to the absence of means of communication, the works were suspended ; and

afterwards M. Selligue, the inventor of the process, earned on similar operations

with greater success near Autun, where there is now a veiy large manufacture of

light oils and paraffine.

The Feymoreau schists resemble in appearance the rich Torbane Hill mineral of

Scotland, and resemble both that and Boghead coal veiy closely, but they cannot

be used as fuel ; they only yield about 15 per cent, of light oils. They are very

thick, but do not extend far in a horizontal direction. They underlie the coal-

measures, or rather the productive part of the measures, and almost represent the

underclay" of a poor coal-seam. In this respect also they resemble the Scotch bitu-

minous shale.

The Autun schists occur considerably above the highest seam of coal in the coal-

measures. They are quarried or obtained from drifts. They are thick shales, bearing

no resemblance whatever to coal, and not in any way capable of being used as fuel.

The best varieties yield 50 per cent, of oils of all kinds, but others are very poor.

They are moderately rich in paraffine.

The shales of the paper-coal, near Bonn, on the Rhine, are also used for distilling,

and paraffine is made front them ; they have no resemblance whatever to coal, and
could not be mistaken for it. The lias-shales (Posidonia-sckists) in many parts of

Germany are also distilled for the light oils and paraffine, with some success.

Bituminous schists of all geological dates, some passing into coal and others hardly

distinguishable from common clay, thus exist in many parts of the world, and all

agree in the one important point, that they may be used for obtaining certain valu-

able products by special treatment. " It is important," the author concluded, " that

such substances should be recognized as a class, and not mixed up with or mistaken

for coals, and that there should be some understanding among scientific and practical

men what coal is, and in what it differs from certain minerals containing hydro-

carbons sometimes associated with it."

  On a Tertiary Bituminous Coal in Transylvania, ivith some remarks on the
           Brown Coals of the Danube. By Professor Ansted, F.R.S.

   The deposits of mineral fuel on and near the Danube are, for the most part, lignites
or brown coal. These are extensive, and have been much used. The fuel burns
freely, and can be employed for all purposes ; but it has two faults. It contains a
large percentage (averaging 15 per cent.) of hygroscopic water, and it falls to powder
on exposure to air, especially in changeable weather. It is uneconomical, and cannot
be stored. These deposits are newer Miocene ; they occur in and with sands not con-
verted into sandstone, and marly clays not shales. They are generally in lenticular

masses, unconnected one with another.
   These lignites do not occur in the smaller mountain-valleys of the Carpathians.

In their place, in the Zsil valley, is a disturbed deposit, also tertiary, and also con-
taining mineral fuel ; but the fuel is here an excellent bituminous coal, and not a
brown coal. There are twelve well-defined workable beds, one of them varying
from 30 feet to 50 feet thick, four others 5 feet to 10 feet, and the rest smaller.

They are associated with good hard coal-grits, shales, and ironstone bands. Two

of the coal-beds are well marked by an overlying bed of fossil shells (a species of

Cerithiutri).

    All these coals are nearly free from hygroscopic water, and stand exposure for

years without injury. They have been examined by the authorities at the Geo-
logical Institute at Vienna, and found to consist of carbon 57 - 8, ash 6-5, water 2*1,
and the carbonic unit is stated at 5582. This is equal to the average of Austrian
bituminous coal, and very much superior to the average of brown coal. There is no
doubt of the tertiary origin of the Zsil coal. The beds containing it have, however,
been much altered and broken, and since covered by unconformable tertiary rocka
of newer date. Above these again is a thick gold-alluvium.

   In conclusion, the author drew attention to the fact that coal, like salt, is limited
to no geological period, and required no high temperature either to elaborate the
plants of which it was made, or to complete the conversion of the vegetable matter
into coal. There is no volcanic district at all near the locality in which the Zsil
coal occurs. There is no underclay beneath the Zsil coal, nor is there beneath the
Liassic and Cretaceous coals, somewhat extensively worked on and near the Danube
or in the Carpathians. These coals have therefore, in all probability, been formed
of transported vegetable matter. The presence of a true bituminous coal of economic
importance in a geological position Irtherto limited to lignite, the author submits
as a fact too important to pass without being placed on record.

         On the Glacier Phenomena of the Valley of the Upper Indus.

                   By Capt. Godwin-Austen, 2-ith Regiment.

   The glaciers noticed in this paper are supposed to be of greater extent than any
yet known ; they occur in that part of the great Himalayan ctain which separates
Thibet from Yarkund, in E. long. 76°, and N. lat. 35-36°, and extend over an area
about 1 00 miles from east to west, from Karakonmi Peak, No. 2 (28,265 ft.), to the
Mountain of Haramosh.

   The glaciers which supply the Hushe River, which joins the Indus opposite Ka-

peloo, were first described. Those of the upper portion of the valley take their rise

on the southern side of the Peak of Masherbruni, and are about 10 miles in length.

The Great Baltoro Glacier takes its rise on the west of Gusherbrum Peak ; on

the north it is joined by a great ice-feeder which comes down from Peak No. 2;

opposite to it, from the south, is another ; both of these extend 9 or 10 miles on

either side of the main glacier. This, from its rise to its further end, measures 30

miles ;  W.its course is from E. to  ;  the breadth of the valley along which it flows

is 12 miles. It receives numerous tributaries along its course, some of which are

N10 miles and more in length ; two of them, on the ., lead up to the Mustakh Pass

into Yarkund (18,000 ft.), whence a glacier descends to theN.E., about 20 miles in

length.

   The Nobundi Sobimdi glacier takes its rise from a broad ice-field which lies to
the N. of lat. 36°, and has a S.E. course for 14 miles, with numerous laterals ; it
then turns S., when it bears the name of the Punmah Glacier ; about 5 miles from
the termination it is joined by a glacier from the N.W., 15 miles in length.

   The Biafo Glacier is perhaps the most remarkable of any of this part of the Hima-
layan range ; it has a linear course of upwards of 40 miles ; the opposite sides of
the valley are very parallel along its who^e length, and the breadth of ice seldom
exceeds a mile, except where the great feeders join it from the N.E.

   From the sumniit-level of the Biafo Gause a glacier is continued westward to

Hisper in Nagayr, 28 to 30 miles in length.
   The Chogo, which terminates at Arundoo, takes its rise between the Mountain

of Haramosh and the Niishik Pass ; it is about 24 miles in length, with numerous
branches from Haramosh, 8 miles in length.

   The waters from all the glaciers, from that of Baltoro in the E. to Chogo in the
W., are collected into the Shigar River, which joins the Indus at Skardo.

   All these glaciers carry great quantities of rock-detritus. The blocks on the

Punmah Glacier are of great size.

   The author next described the groovings and old moraines of a former extension
of the glaciers in this region, showing that they reached many miles beyond their

present terminations, and rose upwards of 400 feet above their present levels. The

paper also described the thick alluvial accumulations of the valley of the Indus,

particularly those of the neighbourhood of Skardo.

On a Neiv Species of Plesiosaurus from the Lias near Whitby, Yorkshire.
             By Dr. A. Cahte, F.L.S., and W. H. Baily, F.G.S.

The very large and perfect Plesiosaurus, the description of which formed the

subject of this communication, was discovered in the Lias at the Kettleness Alum-

pits, near Whitby, on the 27th of July, 1848, and presented by the Marquis of

Normanby to the late eminent Surgeon, Sir Philip Crampton, as a mark of regard

for his scientific attainments, who, in accordance with the anxious desire he always

felt for the advancement of science, bequeathed it to the Royal Zoological Society

of Dublin, in whose Gardens it was first exhibited to the public in May 1853 ; that
Society, with the same object in view, has now deposited it in the Museum of the

Royal Dublin Society, where every facility is ottered for the study of this magni-

ficent and largest example of the genus known. The total length of this skeleton

(of which a drawing of the natural size was exhibited), measured in the line of

its vertebrae, is 22 ft. 5 in. It lies in very nearly a natural position, resting upon

the ventral surface, with the head and neck slightly inclined towards the right side
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the head, with the under jaw, is in a good state of preservation, and, being freed

from the surrounding matrix, the principal bones composing it may be easily re-

cognized ; the vertebral column has throughout its entire length fallen over towards

the  right side, presenting a slight irregular curve                                                                                                                                                                       it exposes in  the cervical series

a side view of the centra or bodies of the vertebra?, with their large neural spines

(neurapophi/scs), and in some instances remains of the cervical ribs or hatchet-

shaped bones (pleurapophyses), the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae being almost

entirely concealed, the massive ends of the neural spines and transverse processes

projecting prominently above the general surface. The caudal portion of the ver-

tebral column is somewhat dislocated and thrown out of position, especially near

its junction with the sacrum ; the bodies are, however, in some cases well exposed,

with their spines and processes. The ribs, thirty in number, are spread out on

either side of the dorsal vertebra?, those of the left side being almost in their

natural position. The anterior paddles are extended from both sides, on a plane

nearly at right angles with the head and neck, the right posterior paddle stretching

out in a direction parallel to the anterior, that on the left side inclining more to-

wards the tail ; in this paddle the tarsal bones, with their phalanges, are deficient,

that portion having been unfortunately carried to the calcining-heap before it was

observed.

The following are some of the principal measurements of this species, which it

was proposed to call Plesiosaurus Crampton i.

   The proportion of the head to the neck, measuring from the point of the superior

maxillary to the extremity of the angular piece of the lower jaw, is as 5 to 8, the
head being, therefore, rather more than half the length of the neck ; its proportion
to the whole skeleton is about 1 to G. This large proportionate size of the head
corresponds very nearly with that of P. megacephalus, Stutchbury, and an unde-

scribed species from Re'dcar, in the Museum of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society,
named P. Zetlandicm by Professor Phillips, from both of which it differs in several

very important particulars.

 --Note. Since reading the above paper, the authors have received information,

through the kindness of Mr. Martin Simpson, the Curator, respecting a Plesiosaurus

in the Whitby Museum, which in its proportional measurements appears to ap-

proximate very closely with the above species.

On an Extinct Volcano in Upper Burmah. By "W. T. Blanfoed, F.G.S.

   The most conspicuous object visible from the River Irawaddi, between its mouth

and the capital of the kingdom of Ava, is the lofty hill of Puppa, which lies about
100 miles beyond the British frontiers, on the east or left bank of the river, and
about 35 miles E.S.E. of the town of Pagau, famous for the enormous number and

the magnificent architecture of its ancient Buddhist temples. The whole undulating-
plain between the River Irawaddi and Puppa Hill consists of the Upper Tertiary
sands. The hill itself is a fine extinct volcano, its height probably a little under
5000 feet. The upper part of the cone is free from the forest which covers the lower
portion, and a complete change in the fiora and the presence of some plants common
to temperate climates show the effect of the altitude reached. The upper part of
the cone is solely composed of ash -beds ; towards the base there is an abundance of
old lava-flows, and a thin cap of these has protected a portion of the soft under-
lying sands, so that the hill is surrounded by a broad ten-ace, the edges of which
rise abruptly 300 or 400 feet from the country around. Some small, flat-capped

hills, detached from the mass, present a peculiar appearance, from their cap of black

ash-beds and lava. contrasting with the white sand of which they are principally

composed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                .
   The following section was obtained from an examination of the clitt surrounding

the terrace (all the beds horizontal) :

1. Lava-flow, forming a cap of variable thickness.
2. Soft white sand, somewhat micaceous, about 80 feet.

3. (Very local) bed of pumice, 5 feet.                              thickness

m4. Volcanic ash and scoria?, with rounded quartz-pebbles, varying

from 5 to 20 feet.

   5. Ferruginous conglomerate, containing the iron-ore of the country, thin.

    6. Soft, coarse, vellowish sand, containing pebbles, about 100 feet seen.

   The author believed that the sands above and below the ash-bed No. 4 were
identical with those containing- fossil wood and bones in various parts of the Ira-

waddi valley. He concluded that the commencement at least of the volcanic out-

burst of Puppa was svnchronous with the existence of Mastodon latidens and the
several Pachydermata and Ruminantia, remains of which have been collected at Ge-

nanthamug and other places in Upper Burmah. These beds contain several fossils
identical with those of the Sewahk beds of India, which have commonly been
considered as Miocene. The large proportion of bones of Ruminants (Oxen and
Deer) in the Irawaddi beds may perhaps suggest a somewhat more recent epoch.

   The shape of the volcanic cone is well preserved, with the exception of the ciater
being broken down on one side, so that no lake exists within. The climate, how-

ever, of this portion of Burmah is extremely dry, and the action of subrenal denuda-
--70 REPORT 1862,

tion is probably very slow, so that the mountain may have preserved its form for a
very considerable geological period. The existence of a peculiar flora on the upper
portion (Pteris aqiiilina), and of a land-shell {Helix Huttoni) common to the slopes

of the Himalayas and the Nilgherris, but not yet found in any portion of the plains of
India or Bunnah, seems to show that the cone has not only been in a qxuescent state,

but also covered with vegetation, at a time when the condition of the surrounding
country was very different from what it is at present, since it is scarcely possible

that ferns or land-shells should cross the large area of dry and arid land intervening
between this isolated peak and the nearest hills (60 or 80 miles at least).

   The position of this extinct cone is interesting, from the circumstance of the well-
known great volcanic line of the Eastern Islands terminating at Banca Island (per-
haps at Chedalia), in the Bay of Bengal. Whether in Tertiary times this volcanic
line extended to the N. towards China is a question for future explorers of the as
yet unknown regions of Upper Bumiak, Yunan, and Thibet.

On some Flint Implements from Amiens. By the Rev. T. G. Bojtset, F.G.S.

            Notes on Beep or Artesian Wells at Norwich.

                    By the Rev. J. Crompton, M.A.

The object of the paper is to put on record the facts connected with an attempt,

by Messrs. J. J. Colman, of London and Norwich, to bore through the Chalk to

the Lower Greensand, for the purpose of obtaining water free from the impurities

of that within the range of the Chalk of the neighbourhood.

The operation is performed by Messrs. Mather and Piatt's machine. In the hard

chalk the rate of penetration has been 20 to 25 feet per day for 500 feet.

After a few feet of alluvium, the borer passed through hard chalk with flints, at

distances of about 6 or 7 feet apart, for 700 feet, with the exception of 10 feet at

the depth of 500 feet, where the rock was soft and of a rusty colour ; thence the

flints were thicker, viz. about 4 feet apart, to the depth of 1050 feet ; then 102 feet

were pierced of chalk, free from flints, to the upper greensand, a stratum of about

6 feet, and next Gault for 36 feet, the whole boring being full of water to within

16 feet of the surface.

In this Gault the proceeding has been unfortunately arrested by breakages of the

rope, leaving the boring-heads lying across the passage, baffling all attempts to re-

move them.

The strata passed through are                                feet.

   The fossils brought up have been the ordinary species found in the Chalk, as

Spatangus cordiformis, and Sharks' teeth (one, that of Lamna Mantellii). From the

Gault, Ammonites lauttis, symmetricm, and fragments of Inoceramus.
   The Foraminifera in the Gairit are

Orbulina, common.                      Eotalina, not uncommon.
Lagena, rare.                          Polyniorphina, not uncommon.
Nodosaria, not uncommon.               Textularia, common.
                                       Globigerina, common.
Frondicularia, rare.                   Fragments of Bryozoa, occasionally.

Dentalina, not uncommon.

Entosalenia, rare.

   In the Chalk, at 500 feet depth, the Foraminifera are more sparsely distributed

they consist chiefly of the two genera Globigerina and Textularia. Rotalina more rare.
   The same is the case at 110, 400, and 1000 feet in depth.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  71

On Flint Implements from Abheville and Amiens. By Dr. Daitbeny, F.E.S.

   Dr. Daubeny exhibited some flint implements obtained from the post-pliocene
deposits near Abbeville and Amiens, with a view of eliciting the opinion of the
Section with respect to their antiquity, and the possibility of their being formed by

other than human agency.

          On the last Eruption of Vesuvius. By Dr. Dattbent, F.R.S.

   The author confined himself to those phenomena which appeared to present some
novelty, and to have a bearing upon the general theory of volcanic action. Vesu-
vius appears during the last few years to be entering a new phase of action. Its

eruptions are more frequent, but less violent, than they were formerly ; they proceed
from a lower level than they did at an earlier period ; and they give vent to cer-
tain volatile and gaseous principles, such as the vapour of naphtha and light car-
buretted hydrogen, or marsh-gas, never before detected. The last eruption has
likewise caused an elevation of the coast to the height of 3 feet 7 inches above the

level of the sea, which has not been observed to take place on any former occasion.

In speculating on the causes which have produced these changes in the nature
of the operations of Vesuvius, the author first considered the theory which recog-
nizes a second class of volcanos distinct from those ordinarily known as such, and
designated by the name of mud-volcanos. As these latter are characterized by the
emission of carburetted hydrogen and naphtha, as well as of semifluid mud, it might

be suggested by those who regard them as partaking of the nature of volcanos, that
Vesuvius from emitting these same products was now passing into the condition of
a mud-volcano. But the author finds reason for denying that the so-called mud-
volcanos, of which Macalube in Sicily and Taman in the Sea of Azof are types, have
anything in common with genuine ones, such as Vesuvius; and he therefore

contends that the above products are generated simply by the action of volcanic
heat upon contiguous beds of Apennine limestone containing bituminous matters
imbedded. Hence would arise the enormous evolution of carbonic acid observed,
and the carburetted hydrogen as well as vapour of naphtha which accompany it,

and which may be regarded as the secondary and incidental products of volcanic

action, whilst the muriatic and sulphurous acids are the primary and essential ones.
The author concluded by recommending to the explorers of volcanic phenomena
an accurate examination of the gases evolved, as the best clue to an explanation of
the true nature and cause of volcanic action. The latest researches of Deville and
others on volcanic emanations present nothing irreconcileable with that chemical
theory which the author has so long espoused ; but all he asks of geologists is dili-
gently to record the facts, chemical as well as physical, which volcanos present,
instead of contenting themselves with simply referring the eruptions to certain great

cosmical changes which they imagine to have taken place.

       On the Wokey Hole Hyama-den. By W. Boyd Dawkins, F.G.S.

  The author described the peculiar features of the den--its accidental discovery,

it being filled up to the roof with debris, stones, and organic remains--and showed
the evidence of human occupation. In three areas in the cave he found ashes of

bone--either of Rhinoceros or Elephas--associated with flint and chert imple-
ments of the same type as those of Amiens and Abbeville, and as those of Sufl'olk.
They were, however, of ruder workmanship, and possibly are of an earlier date.
They were found underlying lines of peroxide of manganese and of comminuted
bone, and overlying, in one of the three areas, remains of the Hyaena, which mark
the old floors of the cave. From this he inferred that " Man, in one of the earlier,

if not the earliest, stages of his being, dwelt in this cave, as some of the most
degraded of our race do at present ; that he manufactured his implements and his
weapons out of flint, brought from the chalk downs of Wilts, and the least fragile
chert of the greensand of the Blackdown Hills, and arrow-heads out of the more

easily fashioned bone. Fire-using, indeed, and acquainted with the use of the

bow, he was far worse armed, with his puny weapons of flint and bone, than his con-
temporaries with their sharp claws and strong teeth. The very fact that he held
72 report--1862.

his ground against them shows that cunning and craft more than compensated for
the deficiency of his armament. Secondly, that as he was preceded in his occupa-

tion, so was he succeeded by the Hyaena." He then gave a brief summary of the

organic remains found, comprising upwards of 1000 bones, 1016 teeth, and 15 jaws,

belonging to

Hyfena spelaea.        Rhinoceros tichorhinus.
                       Rhinoceros hemitsechus (Talc).
Felis spelaea.         Bos priniigenius.

                          laeus, Owen, Foss. Mamm.).

   Rhinoceros hemiterchus may perhaps refer the date of the cave back to tbe earlier
part of the newer Pliocene. At all events this is the second instance known of

this associate of Elephas antiquus being found together with traces of man.

      On the Geology of Burren, Co. Clare. By F. J. Foot, M.A., G.S.I.

   This district is composed of the beds of the upper portion of the Carboniferous
Limestone, capped on the S.W. by the basal shales of the Coal-measures. Contrary
to what is usually the case, the limestone rises into hills upwards of 1000 feet above
the sea, and the sides of these are a step-like succession of steep clirls or blufls, with
broad, fiat terraces of bare rock at their feet; these lines of cliff are accurately laid

down on the map, and are often traceable for many miles. Excepting in the val-

leys, where there are accumulations of drift (a mixture of limestone-gravel and
the debris of granite), the district is almost entirely uncovered by soil, and the sin-
gular form of the hills, together with their barrenness, imparts a most peculiar aspect
to this part of Ireland. The strata are nearly horizontal, but have a general dip

to the S. of about 1° 30'. This dip prevents the lines on the map being actual con-
tours. The limestone varies in colour from pale to dark grey, and in texture is
either compact or crystalline. It contains locally, Corals, Products?, Crinoids, Nau-
tili, Spirifeia?, &c. In many places it is highly magnesian, and there are some good
Dolomites, as well as bands ot Chert. It is traversed hy several sets of joints, which
cut up the rock into numerous prisms of various sizes and forms ; and the extensive
flat surfaces have somewhat the appearance of that of a glacier ; an accurate plan
of a portion of one of these surfaces was also exhibited. This remarkable tract of

country has altogether an area of about 250 square miles.

                On some Models of Foraminifera. By Dr. Fkitsch.

    On the Sliddaw Slate Series. By Professor Harkness, F.R.S., F.G.S.

   The Skiddaw slates of Professor Sedgwick form the lowest of the sedimentary
rocks of the North of England. They are overlaid by a thick series of greenisk-grey
rocks, which, for the most part, consist of porphyries and ashes ; these latter have
been succeeded by the Comston limestone of Professor Sedgwick, the equivalent of

the Bala limestone.

   The sequence of the Skiddaw slates is well shown in the hills which lie west of
Bassenthwaite and Derwentwater Lakes. In this portion of Cumberland, these
slaty strata, with their associated flaggy beds, are seen at Newlands, passing under

Athe superior greenish-grey rocks.  section from this place northwards to Sunder-

land, where the Carboniferous deposits of West Cumberland make their appear-

ance, shows two well-marked anticlinals ; and in several localities in this section

fossils occur. These consist of Graptolites and a branching Bryozoon ; of the former,

the genera appertain to Graptolites, Diplograpsus, Didymograpsiis, Dichograpsus,
Aand Tvtragrapsus.
                    new form of phyllopod Crustacean is also found in several

localities in the course of this section. The fossils of the Skiddaw slates are met

with only in the flaggy beds ; but whenever rocks of this nature occur, they afford

fossils.

  A section from Matterdale, on the N. side of Ullswater, across the Skiddaw slates

to the Carboniferous strata lying N. of Caldbeck-fells, also affords fossils. That
section does not, however, exhibit the same arrangement of the strata. The incli-
nations in this part of the Skiddaw slate of Cumberland are for the most part

S.S.E., and no well-developed axis occurs in this section. This portion of the

--Skiddaw-slate area is intersected in the valley of the Caldew by granite the Skid-

daw Forest granite of Professor Sedgwick. The results of the author's observations
on this granite of the valley of the Caldew induce him to infer that it is an extension
W.S.W. of the syenite forming the northern half on Carrock-fell.

   Three small areas of Skiddaw slate are foimd on the eastern margin of the Lake
district. One of these is on the S.E. side of Ullswater, and is intersected by a
stream called Eggbeck. The other occurs near Eossgill ; and the third at Thorn-
shipgill, a short distance west of Shap. In the two latter slate-pencil quarries

were formerly worked. In these three areas the author has also met with fossils
similar to some of those which have been obtained in the area west of Derwent-

water and Bassenthwaite Lakes.

   Another area occupied by Skiddaw slate is Blackcomb, in the S.W. of Cumber-

land. In this hill the inclinations are N.N. W. ; and along the 'Whicham valley, on

the south flank of Blackcomb, a great fault, previously alluded to by Professor
Sedgwick, occurs. The Skiddaw slates of Blackcomb also yield fossils.

   YY itli reference to the position of the Skiddaw slates, the author is induced to
infer that they appertain to the Lower Llandeilo ; and this conclusion is still fur-
ther corroborated by Mr. Salter, who, from an examination of the fossils, is led to
infer the Lower Llandeilo age of the Skiddaw slate series.

Notice of an Ancient Sea-bed and Beach near Fort William, Inverness-shire.

                   FBy J. Gwyn Jeffrhts;, F.R.S., G.S.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

After making some remarks on the subject of raised beaches and their number in

this country, as well as with respect to the Arctic nature of the shells which had

been found in the Clyde beds, as well as in Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Norfolk, and

other counties, Mr. Jeffreys described some deposits to which his attention had been

drawn by Captain Bedford, R.N., and which consisted of an ancient sea-bed and

beach lying in juxtaposition to each other. The bed is lowermost, and contains

species which usually inhabit a moderate depth of water : the beach appears to

have been formed after the bed was upheaved, because it contains littoral species

and shells which must have been thrown up by the. tide. The organic remains found

in the bed and beach represent fifty-nine species, including forty-eight of Mollusca,

The analogy between these deposits on the one hand, and the Coralline and Red

Crag on the other, was pointed out; but their palpeontological contents being

of a different kind, the Invemess-sliire and Crag deposits were in all probability

not contemporaneous. The now-described deposits underlie several other strata,
which may belong to the Boxdder-clay formation ; but this last is a doubtful point.

Nearly all the species of Mollusca met with on the present occasion live in the adja-
cent seas ; but a few of them (e. g. Pcctcn Islandieus, Columbella Holbbllii, Littorina

squalida, Mmigelia pyramidalis, Margarita costulata, Natica clausa, and Troplion

Gunneri) now exist only in more northern latitudes. Mr. Jeffreys, however, regards
Athis assemblage of shells as Scandinavian, and not as Arctic.

was appended to the paper, showing the proportion which inhabits the Arctic,

ScandinaA'ian, and Scotch seas, as well as of those which occur in a fossil state in

the Crag, Clyde beds, and Kelsey Hill (or Yorkshire) deposits.

On the Geology of the Gold-fields of Otago, New Zealand. By W. Lauder
     Lindsay, M.D. § F.R.S. Edinburgh, F.L.S. & F.B.G.S. London, Sfc.

   The author had made a personal geological survey of the Tuapeka and other gold-
fields of Otago between October 18(31 and January 1862, some of the general results
whereof were published, under the section on the " Geology of Otago," in a Lecture
by him, printed in Dunedin in January 1862, entitled " the Place and Power of

Natural History in Colonization, with special reference to Otago; being portions of a
Lecture prepared for, and at the request of, the. Young Men's Christian Association of
Dunedin," and issued as a pamphlet by and under the auspices of the said Asso-

ciation.

   He had also formed and brought home a considerable collection of the rocks and

minerals of the Otago gold-fields, with relative field-memoranda, maps, and drawings.

   The general results of his observations and deductions may be tabulated as fol-

lows :

   1. The gold and gold-bearing rocks of Otago do not differ essentially, qtwad

mineralogical or geological characters, from those of every other part of the world

hitherto known to be auriferous.

   2. The original matrix of the gold is quartz ; and the latter occurs interbedded
in, or associated with, metamorphic slates, especially of the gneiss, mica, talc,
chlorite- and clay-slate families.

   3. These slates vary greatly in mineralogical character ; but they bear a closer
resemblance to those of central and southern Scotland (Grampians, &c.) than to the
more altered Silurian auriferous slates of Victoria (Australia).

   4. The slates in question are probably of Silurian age ; but this has yet to be
proved, for they are themselves non-fossiliferous ; and as yet the subjacent rocks are
unknown.

   5. At various points there are evidences of considerable disturbance in the

schistose strata by the intrusions and eruptions of trappean rocks, apparently refer-

able to the Tertiary era.

   6. The valleys among the schistose hill-ranges are generally occupied by alluvial

drifts, apparently of Tertiary age, naturally divisible perhaps into a lower or older
group, characterized by its abundant lignites, and a superficial or newer series,
which is chiefly the seat of the operations of the gold-miner.

 --7. The lignitiferous or older drift consists chiefly of quartz gravels in certain
--deposits cemented by means of peroxide of iron and other materials into a hard red

conglomerate associated with thinner strata of clays, sands, and gravels. This
series of beds sometimes occurs at a height of from 500 to 1000 feet above the sea-
level, on the flanks of trappean and other hills.

 --8. The upper or newer drift bottoms the valleys and " flats," so common in
--the hilly parts of the country (where the hills are schistose) consist essentially of

(a) clays, blue, yellow, or red (b) boulder-clays; and (c) gravels, so called, which
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

are really the little-worn or abraded debris of the subjacent and circumjacent slates,
and which are more correctly denominated by the miner's phrase, " chopped slate."

   These beds are immediately superjacent (in the order in which they are above
enumerated) on the generally upturned and very irregular edges of the slates ; and

--the latter, according to their mineralogical character, give a dominant colourt o

the former, the clays and gravels of the gneiss being bluish or greyish, of the

chlorite-slates greenish, of the mica-slates, in proportion as they are less or more
ferruginous, yellow or red.

 --9. Gold occurs chiefly in the gravel or "chopped slate " above described, this

constituting the " wash-dirt " of the miner. It is frequently foimd most abundantly
in "pockets" (hollows or crevices) of the irregular upturned edges of the subja-
cent slates, whereon the gravel immediately reposes. It is disseminated through
the clays in some localities; while in others it is sometimes collected in quantity
in cavuies, or " pockets," under the boulders of the boulder-clay beds.

   10. The gold is partly granular or gunpowder-like, partly scaly, nuggety, or
crystallized ; and it exhibits every gradation, intermixture, and variety of each of

these forms or kinds in different localities.

    11. It is associated, in different localities, with iserine (titaniferous iron-sand)

iron-pyrites, common and arsenical (mispickel) ; cassiterite (tin-sand or oxide of

tin) ;  topaz (of  the gcndtes-d'eau character, blue or colourless)                                                                                                                                                                           garnets, and other
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

minerals.

  Much of Otago remains yet to be explored, especially the mountainous western

portion of the province ; but, from the geological structure of those portions of
the province he personally examined, the author draws or makes the following in-

ferences, deductions, or predictions :

   1. That the geological basis of the greater part of Otago consists of auriferous
metamorphic slates. This refers especially to the great central and western moun-
tain-ranges ; for instance, those which encircle the large interior lakes (Hawea,
TVanaka, and Wakatip).

   2. That these great mountain-systems are probably the source of the tertiary
drift so abundantly distributed over the lower parts of the province, which drift
consists mainly of quartzose and schistose debris.

   3. That this tertiary drift, in both its lignitiferous and more strictly auriferous
series of beds, will be found much more extensively and largely distributed over the

province than at present.

   4. That gold is very extensively and largely distributed over the province ; and

that many gold-fields remain to be discovered, especially in the interior ; though

nothing short of actual mining, or "digging," can determine the localities of

"jiayable gold-fields."

5. That the supply of gold is at present practically unlimited; and that the auri-

ferous resources of Otago are only beginning to be developed, and will only be fully

developed in the course of many years, by a. The addition of quartz -mining, and

others of the skilled branches of gold-mining, to the shallow or " alluvial digging,"

to which the miner's operations are at present mainly confined. This implies a

greater concentration of attention than at present on the auriferous quartzites, from

which the drift or alluvial gold has originally been derived, the working whereof,
should they exist to any extent, is much more likely to yield a permanently remu-

nerative emplovment, and a permanent and valuable source of revenue, than the
said " alluvial digging." b. The systematic application of improved chemical and

mechanical, or chemico-mechanical, processes to gold-mining, and the expenditure

thereon, or application thereto, of suitable capital, c. The establishment of gold-

mining as one of the permanent industrial resources of the province, d. The

systematic prospecting, Dy exploring and experimental parties suitably equipped,
partly geological and surveying, partly mining and " digging." e. The liberal and
enlightened encouragement of mining and of the miners by the construction of

rail- and tramways, the opening-up of roads, the building of bridges, the establish-

ment of townships, the sale of waste lands at suitable prices, the adequate supply

of fuel by the working of lignite-beds or otherwise, the institution of proper mining

laws and mining boards, and other measures pertaining strictly to the legislative

function of the State.

On the Geology of the Gold-fields of Auckland, New Zealand. By W. Lauder
    Lindsay, M'.D. $ F.R.S. Edinburgh, F.L.S. <5? F.B.G.S. London, 6,'c.

The author had personally made a geological examination of the Coromandel

gold-field, in the province of Auckland, in February 1862, having previously

spent several months on a similar survey of the Otago gold-fields, lie described

Coromandel as a different type of gold-field from Tuapeka (Otago), and, as such,

Newof interest as illustrative of the general geology of the                                                        Zealand gold-fields.

The main results of his observations and deductions may be concisely stated thus :

1. The geology of the northern gold-fields of New Zealand, including those of

Nelson as well as of Auckland, does not differ essentially from that of the southern

or Otago gold-fields (as the geology of the latter is described in his paper " On the

Geology of the Otago Gold-fields," save in so far as regards certain minor details.

The parent slates, for instance, are in the north more frequently of a clay-slate or

argillaceous character than in the south ; the auriferous quartzites are frequently

developed to an extent as yet unknown in Otago ; the evidences of trappean dis-
turbance are more numerous, and the metamorphism of the slates by the contiguity
of the erupted or intruded traps better marked. Nor does the character of the

gold differ materially, save in so far as, in certain localities, it is more generally

associated with its quartz matrix.

   2. The Coromandel Peninsula consists mainly of a mountain ridge, running
nearly north and south ; the mountains having a bold serrated outline, and varying
in height from 1000 to 2000 feet. The valleys between the spurs given off laterally

by this main or dividing range are of the character generally of ravines or gorges,
occupied by mere mountain streams ; the " flats " or alluvial tracts at their mouths,

and on the coast, are inconsiderable.

3. This mountain-range consists apparently of slates of Silurian age, generally

of argillaceous character, but greatly altered by contact with, or proximity to,
numerous outbursts or intrusions of trappean and other rocks. The mountains are

so densely wooded, and so difficult of access, that it is only here and there in the

gorges of the streams that sections of these slates may be examined. In these

sections the slates are frequently found to resemble Lydian stone or the slaty

varieties  of  basalt  (such  as  clinkstone)                                                       while they are  disposed more or  less
                                                                                                 ;

vertically, their irregular upturned edges affording the most convenient and

abundant "pockets" for the detention and storage of the alluvial gold washed

from the higher grounds.

   4. [Local geologists describe the fundamental rock of the Coromandel mountain-
system as granitic, and the granite as forming here and there the " aiguilles " of

the dividing ridge. The author met with no granite in situ ; nor did he discover

granitic boulders or pebbles in the boulder-clays of the auriferous drift, or in the

shingly beds of the mountain streams about Coromandel Harbour.]

   5. The Coromandel slates are characterized by their prominent and numerous
quartz " reefs," consisting of auriferous quartzites. Here and there, where the
dense vegetation admits, these reefs arc met with in situ, frequently as " dykes,"

standing prominently above the general level of the slates ; sometimes forming the
top of the dividing ridge itself. The proximity and abundance of such quartzites

are sufficiently indicated by the immense numbers of huge quartz-boulders or

blocks which bestrew the low ground and occupy the ravines and gorges, which

blocks are characterized by comparative angularity. The quartz is frequently of

the porous, light, spongy character so prevalent in the gold-fields of Australia,

Nova Scotia, California, and other auriferous countries ; and its colour is frequently

buff, brown, ochrey, or vermilion, the result, apparently, of different degrees of

ferruginous impregnation.

0. The auriferous drift is mostly of the charac.er of the newer or upper Tertiary

drifts of the Otago gold-fields, consisting essentially of a. variously coloured clays
b. boulder-clays, also variously coloured ; and c. gravels, of the " chopped slate '
                                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                        81

character, the debris of the component rocks of the parent ranges, which gravels rest
immediately on the " bed-rock " or slate. In this gravel, as at Otago, the gold

chiefly occurs ; hence to these gravels are, as yet, mainly directed the operations

of the miner.

 --7. The gold itself occurs in the form of dust, scales, or nuggets frequently as

scaly nuggets or " pepites," but still more generally dendritically disseminated in

quartz-pebbles, which are usually ochrey or brownish in colour.

8. It is largely associated with iserine (titaniferous iron-sand), apparently of

the character of that so abundant at Taranaki. This mineral, indeed, appears to

Newbe associated with gold in almost all the                                                                                                                     Zealand gold-fields.

9. The prevalent volcanic rocks, which burst through, overlie, or are otherwise

associated with the slates, are mainly various trachytes, tuffs, basalts, and syenites.

A hard breccia, consisting to a great extent of fragments of jasper and flint, re-

sembling somewhat the a cement " or quartz conglomerate of the older or lower

Tertiary auriferous drifts of the Otago gold-fields, occurs on Beeson's Island, in

Coromandel Harbour, which island is mainly or altogether tufaceous. Boulders of

basalt and syenite bestrew the tops of the hills which form the greater part

of the said island                                                                   and basaltic boulders                                                       are associated with  quartzose ones in the
                                                                                  ;

shingly bed3 of the mountain-streams of Coromandel and in the boulder-clays of

the auriferous drift.

Contrasting the Tuapeka (Otago) with the Coromandel gold-fields, the author

indicated the following respective peculiarities :

At Tuapeka (Otago) : a. The bare open country, resembling the Lammermoors

of Scotland, consisting of gently undulating "ranges," of a height generally of

from 500 to 1500 feet. b. The abundance of the auriferous drift, and the compa-

rative insignificance or scarcity of the parent quartzites. c. The scarcity of timber

for fuel and slabbing; but, on the other hand, the presence of lignites, d. The

inclement climate, e. The difficulties of laud-communication with the capital
(Dimedin), arising from insufficient roads, f. Unlimited powers of " prospecting "

--and "working," arising from the absence of a native population.
   At Coromandel : «. The precipitous mountain-ranges, densely covered with a

jungly vegetation to the top                                                                                                                                     the hill-bases impinging directly on the sea-margin,
                                                                                                                                                              ;

   From his observations at Coromandel and Tuapeka, as well as in the other parts

of New Zealand he visited during his tour of 1861-62, the author makes the fol-

lowing statements, inferences, or predictions :

   1. That while there is, at Coromandel, a very limited and insignificant field for
alluvial digging, there is ample scope for quartz-mining.

   2. That the auriferous resources of Coromandel will only be fully developed in

the course of many years by the application of all modern improvements in che-

mistry and mechanics to systematic mining, which must become one of the per-

manent industrial occupations of the province of Auckland, and which will demand

the sinking of a large capital in the first instance.

3. That slates similar to those of Coromandel, with associated auriferous quartz-

ites, will be found to occur over a comparatively large area of the province of

Auckland.

   4. That new gold-fields remain to be discovered in that province ; though experi-
ment only, and on a suitable scale, can determine where, and whether "payable,"

gold-fields exist.

   5. That whereas lignites are widely distributed over the province of Auckland, it
is most desirable to ascertain whether they are of similar geological age to those of

Otago, and associated with the same auriferous drifts.

6. That whereas, in Australia and other auriferous countries, gold is not con-

fined necessarily to metamorphic slates or their derived drifts, but occurs occasion--

ally in granitic and hornblendic (syenitic) rocks or their debris ; and whereas, though

Newthis is rare in  Zealand, there is, according to the testimony of Mr. Haast,

the Government geologist of the Canterbury province, at least one good instance of

such an occurrence in the province of Nelson (in the beds of the rivers Roto-iti

and Roto-roa, where the gold could apparently only have been derived from the

--decomposition or degradation of rocks of a syenitic or hornblendic character) ; the

attention of prospectors and miners, not only in the province of Auckland, but in

that of Otago and, indeed, in all the New Zealand provinces (all of which will

probably be found to be to a greater or less extent auriferous), should be directed

to drifts derived from granitic and hornblendic rocks, as well as to those resulting

from the detrition of Silurian and other slates.

7. That it is probable the auriferous system of rocks (the supposed Silurian

slates) extends from the province of Otago into the adjacent provinces of South-

land and Canterbury--from Nelson (where they are already known to exist to an

extent second only to that in Otago, and where, indeed, " gold-fields " have

--been successfully worked for a considerably longer period) into Canterbury and
--from Auckland into Wellington and adjacent districts though to what extent re-

mains to be determined by actual survey and experiment.

  8. Contrasting the Northern with the Middle Island of New Zealand, it is pro-

bable that the latter is more extensively and largely auriferous than the former

that in the former the auriferous quartzites are developed out of proportion to

the derived drifts, while in the latter the reverse is the case; and that, should

this supposition prove to be correct, the character of the gold-mining in the two

islands will necessarily differ most materially.

  9. Speaking in general terms, auriferous rocks may be said to extend throughout

the New Zealand islands, the exceptions being where they are interrupted by

recent volcanic formations, traps of various ages (mostly Tertiary), limestones of

various ages, extensive Tertiary beds, and other geological series or systems.
   The author concluded by strongly advocating the necessity of an immediate

--systematic Geological survey of the province of Auckland one implying a duration

of about five years, with an expenditure on staff, travelling, and publications of

about £10,000. He recommended this equally for all the New Zealand provinces

of which geological surveys have not yet been made pointing to the example

engaged on a three years' survey of that, geologically, most interesting province.

   On the Paleontology of Mineral Veins ; and on the Secondary Age of some

Mineral Veins in the Carboniferous Limestone. By Charles Moore, F. G.S.

   The author's attention was directed to this subject by the very fissured character
of the Carboniferous Limestone of the Mendip Hills, and by observing that many
of the fissures had subsequently been filled with deposits containing organic remains
of later geological ages, some of them being probably as young as the inferior oolite.
In a quarry near one in which the author had previously found the3Iicrolestes,Placodus,
&c, there were as many as fifteen vertical fissures within a length of 200 feet, passing
down through inclined beds of Carboniferous Limestone, one of them being 15 feet

in breadth at the base. These contained organic remains belonging to the Carbo-
niferous Limestone, the Rhsetic bone-bed, and the Middle Lias. In the upper por-
tions of some of the fissures, galena, sulphate of barytes, and iron-ore were present,
showing that in these instances the above minerals must be of Secondary age.

    In further investigating this point, the mineral deposits of the Mendips, near
Charter House, were examined. In descending a lead-mine at this place, the author

--found the vein-stuff very varied in its character sometimes a conglomerate, then

almost composed of Encrinital stems, with a few Corals, all much abraded by the

action of water ; and at a depth of 175 feet a deposit of eight feet of blue marl
containing 7h per cent, of galena. In this he found about 130 species of organic
remains, consisting of part of an Ammonite, Belemnites, ten species of Brachiopoda,
together with numerous univalves and Foraminifera. Fish-remains were also abun-
dant, of different species; and there were also pieces of drift-wood which had
been converted into jet, It was thus evident that the Mendip lead-veins had been

within the influence of the ocean during the Secondary period, and that the mineral
they contained coidd not be of more ancient date. Somewhat similar results at-
tended an examination of the districts around Bristol and Weston-super-Mare.

   The author next examined samples furnished from six mines, in Carboniferous
Limestone from Shropshire, Yorkshire, and Cumberland. From Weardale, out of
twenty-seven small samples, organic remains were obtained from fourteen, the
lowest being 678 feet from the surface ; and the same result occurred from Alston
Moor and the White Mines, Cumberland. In one small sample from the Grassing-
ton Mines, Skipton, which when washed was reduced to half an ounce in weight,
not less than 156 specimens were found. These include the author's genus Zellania,

hitherto never observed in any stratified bed lower than the middle lias ; and nu-
merous Conodonts, which have never been found higher than the Ludlow bone-bed.

   It was argued that we had no evidence of the contents of mineral veins having

been derived from volcanic agency, nor by any electrical action removing the mine-
rals from the adjoining rock and redepositing them in the veins. The author's

view was, that what are now mineral veins were once open fissures which were

traversed by the ancient seas of the period, and their derived contents deposited
and that whilst these infillings were proceeding, the minerals, which might pre-
viously have been held in solution in the water, were by the operation of electrical
and other causes precipitated, and that thus, instead of being due to volcanic action,
they were to be attributed to aqueous and sedimentary deposition.

                 Contributions to Australian Geology and Paleontology

                               By Chaeles Mooee, F.G.S.

   After noticing the evidence recently obtained of the presence of Mesozoic rocks

in Australia by Mr. Gregory, the Eev. W. B. Clarke, and Mr. Hood, the author

--remarked on the paucity of organic remains that had yet been obtained from these

rocks in the whole probably not more than thirty species. He then referred to a

series of fossils he observed being exhibited at a meeting of the Somersetshire
Archaeological and Natural History Society, by Captain Sanford, of Nynehead, to

whom they had been forwarded by Mr. Shenton from Western Australia. They

appeared to have been chiefly derived from beds of oolitic age, and probably from
the same district as those sent to the Exhibition by Mr. Gregory ; the Trigonice,
CucuHcea, Belemnites, &c, being of the same species. Captain Sanford's collection,
including a number of duplicates, comprised about sixty specimens, and also a block
of stone about 10 in. by 6 in., which, on being closely examined, showed that the
bed from which it was derived must have been very rich in organisms ; for on its

surfaces the author was able to make out about thirty species, or as many as had

previously been discovered from all the Australian Mesozoic deposits, "it con-
tained an Ammonite, Trigonice (allied to T. costata), Pecten, Lima, Cucidlcea, Avicula,
Ostrea, Turbo, and other univalves, Rhynchonella variabilis, Pentacrinites, &c.

   Amongst the Ammonites in this collection were several allied to the A. radians,
and appeared to indicate for the first time the presence of the Upper Lias in
Australia. There were also several specimens of the Myacites liasianus, found only

in the ironstone zone of the Middle Lias in this country ; and, singularly, the matrix
containing the Australian specimens yielded 52 per cent, of metallic iron.

   In the absence of sections, and from the different lithological characters of the
shells, the author supposed them to have been obtained from beds of different
geological ages, and that, from their abraded character in some instances, they were
probably found in derived deposits, and not in the parent rock ; and that it was
not improbable, for the same reasons, that this applied also to the other Mesozoic
remains that had hitherto been found in Australia.

      On the Fossils of the Boulder-clay in Caithness. By C. W. Peach.

   The author first mentioned that, as so little was known of the fossils of this for-
mation, he thought that a short communication on the subject might be acceptable
to the Section. The Boulder-clay occurs more or less all over Caithness. In some

places it is very deep, especially on the banks and estuaries of rivers, sides of burns,
&c, where it is found in some places to the depth of 60 or 80 feet and at varioua

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

levels up to 200 feet. In some parts it is filled with stones of various sizes. It is

of different degrees of hardness ; and the shells, although generally distributed, vary
in number at different places, as well as the stones. The stones are all more or less

striated and ground. Above the lower clay in many places are beds of sand, and

from these beds wide cracks run down the clay, some vertically, others diagonally,

--and from these smaller cracks diverge horizontally all being filled with sand no

doubt from above, that on the sides of them being cemented together, and the centre

quite loose. This sand contains organisms similar to those of the clay, but in a

very friable- condition. Above the sand is often seen more clay, and crowning the

whole a deposit of stones derived from all the previous geological formations, some

being of great size. One such, of granite, at least 30 tons in weight, near the Cus-

tom-House at Wick, is G6 feet above the level of the sea. The clay rests upon

rocks grooved and polished. The grooves run about N. and S., with variations to

the E. and W. Some of the shells are almost perfect, the smaller and more deli-

cate ones being most so ; others, especially the Astartes, are covered with their

epidermis ; a few are perforated, evidently by the Whelk and the boring sponge,
ACliona. In no case had he found two valves of any shell united.
                                                                             difficulty often

presents itself to many on finding that although the edges of the greater part of the

broken shells are rounded, others retain their sharpness, as if only just broken.

This difficulty will vanish if a collection of the recent broken shells be made from

the sea-shore, for there the very same appearances may be seen, agreeing in every

particular with those of the Boulder-clay.

The mode of transport he thought had been by water-borne ice, the work of

long periods. As he only wished to introduce the organ'sms, he left all this to

others.

   He then read a detailed list of the organisms, first observing that, as Mr. Jeffreys

had kindly examined all the shells and Dr. Bowerbank the sponges, the list might
be depended upon :

              On Fossil Fishes from the Old Red Sandstone of Caithness.
                                      By C. W. Peach.

    The author introduced the subject by stating1 that at the Meeting of the Associ-
ation at Aberdeen in 1858 he laid before the members some fishes from tie Old

Red Sandstone which he thought not only new to Caithness, but one of whkh he

believed new to geology. These had since been examined by Sir P. Egerton, and
figured and described in Decade X. of the Government Geological Survey. The
one he had considered new, and which proved to be so, had a true bony vertebral
column, and thus differed from the fishes of the Old Red period previously dis-

covered. He expressed the great gratification that he felt at being relieved from

the painfid position of standing alone, as he had done for some yeais, in the opinion

that true bony fishes occurred in the Old Eed of Caithness. He then entered into

a description of several species (fine specimens of which he laid on the table) that

--he had further collected, and which he considered also as new to Caithness some

new altogether ; these have long lobated fins, bony ribs and processes, &c. One
species was evidently Gyroptychius of M'Coy; and although some of the others be-
long to that genus, they are new species. In this opinion he was to a great extent

supported by Professor Huxley, to whom the whole of the specimens will be sent

for examination and description.

 On the Correlation of the Slates and Limestones of Devon and Cornwall with
      the Old Eed Sandstones of Scotland, Sfc. By W. Pengeely, F.G.S.

   The distinguished author of ' Siluria,' as geologists well know, has made a tri-
partite division of the slates and limestones of Devon and Cornwall, as well as of
the Old Red Sandstones of Scotland, &c, and given chronological equivalency to
the Upper, Middle, and Lower groups of each respectively. Thus, he places the
Barnstaple and Pethcrwin beds (the latter characterized by the presence of Cly-
menia and Cypridina) on the horizon of the Upper Old Red, with its Jfoloptychius
and Phyllolepis ; the limestones of Torquay, Newton, and Plymouth, in which are
found Stringocephahts, Calceola, Bronteus, Accrvularia, &c, are made to synchro-
nize with the deposits of Caithness, &c, containing the remains of Astcrolcpis, Coc-

costeus, &c. ; whilst the slates of Meadfoot, &c., in South Devon, and Looe, &c, in
Cornwall, distinguished by the remarkable coral Pleurodictyum problematicum, are
regarded as the equivalents in time of the Lower Old Red rocks of Forfar and the
North-east Highlands, which are charged with Cephalasjns, Pterasjris, and Onchm*.

   Though this co-ordination may be said to have found a large acceptance, it is

--not in keeping with the opinion of" some who laboured long and sedulously amongst

the older rocks of Devon and Cornwall, for example, the late Sir H. De laBechef
and the Rev. David Williamsf ; nor is it unchallenged by some existing writers,

amongst whom may be mentioned Mr. Page§ and Mr. Jukes ||.

    That some diversity of opinion should exist respecting the true relations of the

two systems of rocks now under notice is what might be expected when their
lithological and paleeontologieal dissimilarities are remembered. The northern beds

are eminently arenaceous, whilst those in the south are almost exclusively argilla-

ceous or calcareous; the former teem with fossil fish, and the latter with the

exuviae of molluscous and radiate animals : but, according to our fossil registers,

Scotland does not yield the shells, corals, or sponges so abundant in Devonshire

nor are the ichthj-olites of the former found in the latter area : they have no
organic remains in common.

   It will doubtless be remembered, however, that, in his 'Palaeozoic Fossils of

%Cornwall, Devon, and West Somerset r Professor Phillips has figured and de-

scribed, as a scale of IToloptyclinis, a fossil found in the slates of Meadfoot, near

Torquay, in South Devon. It would seem that this identification has not been

considered perfectly reliable, since the fossil has not found a place in subsequent
works on the Devonshire beds, or in Professor Morris's Catalogue of British

Fossils.

The mineral and mechanical characters of the Old Red rocks may, perhaps, suf-

ficiently explain the absence in them of mollusks and other dwellers at the sea-

bottom ; but there seems no satisfactory mode of accounting for the non-appearance

Weof fishes in the slates and limestones of Devon and Cornwall.  are asked, by

one proposed solution of the problem, to suppose that some geographical difficulty

or barrier separated the two areas and prevented the migration and mingling of

their inhabitants ; whilst another suggests that the Old Red fish were probably at

home in fresh water only, and ought not to be looked for in beds so decidedly ma-

rine as those of Devon and Cornwall.

The interesting and important discovery, by Sir R. I. Murchison *, of the inter-

mixture, in the same Devonian bed in Russia, of the fish of the Upper and Middle

Old Red of Scotland with the shells of Devonshire seems to dispose of the latter

of the two proposed solutions just mentioned, but leaves the difficulty untouched
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

nor does it appear that the synchronism of the representative beds in Britain neces-

sarily flows from it. It proves, of course, that the fish and shells lived at one and

Wethe same time in Russian, not that they did so in British, waters.             may have

an example here of the distinction between geological contemporaneity and syn-

chrony, so ably pointed out, on a recent occasion, by Professor Huxley f ·
   At the Meeting of the British Association held at Cork, in 1843, Mr. Peach

brought under the notice of the Geological Section certain fossils which had then

recently been found, by Mr. Couch, in the Devonian slates of Polperro, in Cornwall.

The palaeontologists to whom they were then submitted considered tbem to be the
remains of fishes ; this was the opinion also of the late Mr. Hugh Miller at first,

but subsequently he considered them to be very doubtful and extremely puzzling
ultimately they were pronounced, by Professor M'Coy and Mr. Carter, of Cambridge,
to be sponges merely. It may still be doubted, however, whether certain fossils
found with them were not true ichthyolites ; indeed, one specimen which, a few

years since, I found in the same beds at Looe, in Cornwall, has been pronounced by

Sir P. Egerton and others to be a decided ichthyodorulite %. It has not been iden-

tified, however, even generically.

  A few weeks since, I had the good fortune to find a fossil in the Pleurodictyum

slates at Meadfoot, near Torquay ; that is, in certainly the lowest group of the rocks

--of South Devon, and which Sir R. I. Murchison has placed on the horizon of the

binnie beds, belonging to Sir R. I. Murchison 's "Upper Old Red."

   This fossil, then, appears to necessitate the belief, either that the organism which
it represents had a greater vertical range than has been supposed (that is, that it

belonged to the Lower and Middle, as well as Upper, Old Red fauna), or that the
Pleurodictyum beds of Devon and Cornwall, instead of being on the horizon of the
Lower, are on that of the Upper Old Red Series of Scotland.

   To accept the first of these (apparently the only two) alternatives would be to

accept the difficulty of supposing that Phyllolepis dates from the times of Cephalaspis,

the extinction of which it witnessed, as well as the subsequent introduction and
withdrawal of Coccostem, Asterolejns, and others ; and yet that, unlike its early

contemporaries, it failed to leave any trace of its existence in the Old Red rocks,

save only in the uppermost of their three groups.

  --Rejecting this, however, we seem compelled to adopt its rival, which amounts

to this : There are in Devon and Cornwall no representatives of the Lower and
Middle Old Red rocks of Scotland, but the Lowest (the Pleurodictyum) beds of

harmony with those of Sir H. De la Beche and the Rev. David Williams, already
spoken of, as well as that advocated by myself in an earlier paper*. It will be

seen also that the indications of the supposed scale found by Professor Phillips were

to the same effect. Like the Old Red Sandstone fish found in Russia by Sir R. I.
Murchison, the Phyllokpis-scale was surrounded with marine shells f, and also by
corals ; hence the ancient fish to which it belonged was not incapable of living in

the sea.

                      On the Gold-bearing Strata of Merionethshire.

                          By T. A. Readwtn, F.G.8., F.S.S.

   The author referred to a paper read before the Association at Manchester in
1861, the object of which, he said, was to point out the probability of gold-seeking
in the Dolgelley district being, at no very remote date, of commercial importance.

He stated that, since the last Meeting, he had acquired additional facts connected

with the subject, and his wish was to present them in support of the opinion ex-

pressed in the paper referred to.

   The author said that he had employed an eminent analytical chemist for several
months upon the spot, to test the accuracy of his former experiments ; and the assays
referred to in the paper were made of 8000 grains, taken from quantities of 56 lbs.,
after the most careful sampling, instead of the customary 400 grains.

   He said that the geological features of the district were now too well known to

require more than a repetition of the general statement that the rocks are of the
Cambrian and Lower Silurian series, forming a junction in a very sinuous course,
and frequently cut through by narrow bands of porphyritic greenstone.

   The metalliferous veins have a general bearing N.E. and S.W., with an underlie

to the north.

   The auriferous district under notice is comprised in the Ordnance Survey Maps,
75, S.E., and the upper part of 59, N.E.

 --For convenience, he divides the district into the following sections : Cwmhei-

sian, Maesgwm, Berthwllyd, Cambrian, Clogau, and Vigra.
   The parishes included in the notice are Llanfachreth, Trawsfynydd, Llanddwye,

Llaneltyd, and Llanaber.

                                   The Cwmheisian Section.

   The Cwmheisian uchaf Mine has in it more than twenty strong metalliferous lodes.
One very remarkable junction of about fourteen lodes is 40 feet wide, and the whole
of this mass of lode-stuff contains more or less gold.

  A large number of assays gave from 3 to 19 dwts. of gold to the ton of quartz.

Picked specimens of galena have given as much as 16 ounces to the ton ; and more

than 170 ounces of gold were taken by Mr. Clement from about 300 tons of mine-
ral from all parts of the mine. Mr. Arthur Dean produced 148 ounces from 157^
tons of ore. Gold, visible in blendic quartz, has been discovered within the last
month.

    Civmheisiati Isaf is a silver-lead mine, adjoining the last-mentioned on the south.
The galena yields about 47 oimces of silver to the ton ; and one lode in the mine
gives, on assay, 5 to 11 dwts. of gold to the ton of mineral.

   Gwynfynydd Mine is opposite Cwmheisian Ucha, on the west bank of the river
Mawddach. Galena from this mine, though poor in silver, has occasionally given

--as much as 8 ounces of gold to the ton.
   Hafod-y-bach Mine. Samples of quartz, indiscriminately taken from this mine,
gave from 3 to 5 dwts. of gold to the ton. The mineral here is probably richer
than this.

   Tyddynghcadis Silver-Lead Mine is on the west bank of the river Mawddach,
about eight miles from Dolgelley, in the direction of Tanybwlch. This mine is
situate exactly at the junction of the Cambrian and Lower Silurian rocks, which is
distinctly observable at the top of the charming waterfall, Pistil-y-Cain.

   The average quantity of silver contained in the galena is from 50 to 60 oimces to

the ton. Selected specimens have given as much as 300 ounces. Visible gold is
occasionally found in the galena, and he had seen it also in copper-pyrites.

   Assays for gold gave from 6 to 11 dwts. per ton. Some moss pulled from the
river-side had small specks of gold attached to the roots.

   Penmaen Copper Mine has some very strong metalliferous veins upon it, said to
be auriferous. Visible gold is said to have been found here.

   Dolfrwynog Gold Mine is situate about a mile over the mountain eastward from

--Cwmheisian, and includes the farms denoted on the Ordnance Map Dolfrwynog,

Tynsimna, Bwlchroswen, and Rhoswen. This is a very remarkable property.
There are several strong lodes, only one of which he notices in the paper : it is

known as the " Gold Lode." He had stones of beautiful quartz from this lode,

containing at least 400 ounces of gold to the ton ; and he believes that a goodly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                !

amount of gold will be obtained from this lode, although it underlies north 6 feet
in a fathom, and at the depth of about 60 fathoms enters a spur of the North Dol-

frwynog Mine. He had specimens from this lode in the International Exhibition,

and had seen stones taken from a depth of nearly 40 fathoms, richer than any
at Clogau. The bulk of this lode-stuff will give on an average, he thought, from
10 to 15 dwts. of gold to the ton.

 --East Dolfrwynog Mine is on the east of the last-mentioned, and takes in the

farms marked on the Ordnance Map Buarthrae, Doledd, and Penbryn. There are

six or more lodes on this property, which give on assay from 6 to 9 dwts. of gold to

the ton.

  --The Dolfrwynog Gold Lode runs into Penbryn a few yards from the spot, at

Dolfrwynog, where the richest gold was discovered. It is about 5 feet wide, and
of precisely the same character, and will probably prove as rich.

   North Dolfricynog Gold and Copper Mine is situate on the east bank of the
Mawddach. There are ten metalliferous veins in this property, and all of them
auriferous. The Dolfrwynog rich Gold Lode underlies into this sett; and it is
certain that at the depth of 60 fathoms very rich gold will be found.

   Assays of the lode-stuff from this mine give an average of 9 dwts. of gold to the

ton.

   The author said that he had once extracted as much as 6 ounces to the ton from
stuff in which gold was not detectable under a powerful microscope. He had recently
superintended the removal of about 100 tons of alluvium from the eastern bank of
the Mawddach, with the object of discovering whether the particles of gold found
therein increased in size from the surface to the bed-rock. He found this to be
the case ; and the sample of coarse-grain gold produced was perhaps the most in-

teresting item of the recent discoveries. This gold was obtained by a very rough

--washing over a trough 30 feet long, a process which washed away all the fine gold,

weighing probably ten times as much as the coarse gold obtained. It is probable

that the whole side of this mountain will be found to contain gold in paying quan-
tities on the erection of machinery to economize labour.

    West Dolfrwynog Copper and Gold Mine adjoins the last-mentioned on the south,

and is marked on the Ordnance Map the " Turf Copper Mine," from the singular

fact that, some time ago, about £'10,000 of copper was sold from the ashes of peat,
there burnt for the purpose. The water at the present time is highly saturated

with copper ; and a shaft, now in course of sinking, will probably discover a large

 deposit of copper-ore, if not gold.

    The lode-stuff of this mine gives on assay about the same quantity of gold as
 North Dolfrwynog. On a portion of the mine the author found the alluvium to
 contain gold under the same circumstances and in about the same proportions as
 the North Dolfrwynog Mine. Gold has been obtained here at the rate of 6 ounces
 to the ton. The minerals of this mine and Dolfrwynog are identical in character.

                                    The Maesgwm Section

    Is on the western side of the Trawsfynydd Road, nearly opposite Tyddynglwadis.

    Maesgwm Mining Sett extends over* 1600 acres, and has three large lodes on it,

 which are all auriferous.
    The Cwrnheisian Great Gold Lode aims into it, and the Ganllwyd Gold Lode.
                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                              89

   Ganlhcyd Gold Mine has two very distinct lodes, from one of which he had taken
several stones of visible gold. The poorest stuff contains on assay 10 to 11 dwts.
of gold to the ton. This mine will probably prove a second Clogau, as the lode-
stuff is identical in character with the Saint David's Lode.

   Coed-cy-fair Mine is S.W. of Maesgwni, and has the same surface appearance.
Visible gold has recently been found here. Assays have given 3 to 5 dwts. to the
ton from surface quartz.

                                  The Berthwllyd Section.

   Berthwllyd Mine is situate on the summit of the precipitous and lofty ridge of
hills to the* west of the curious little roadside inn, the " Oakley Arms," at Tyn-y-

groes, on the Trawsfynydd road from Dolgelley.
   There is what Mr. Warington Smyth appropriately calls " that grand champion

lode Berthwllyd," which runs in a direction N.N.E. and S.S.W. for about a mile.
Blende and galena are the chief products of this mine, all of which are auriferous.

   Only a few days ago, the author saw both blende and galena pounded fine, and

gold washed therefrom, in the proportion of 3 to 4 ounces to the ton. He himself

washed gold from the alluvium of so fine a quality that it floated on water.

   As much as 6 oimces to the ton has recently been extracted by Britten's amal-

gamating-machine. This mine is destined to produce, he thinks, from its inex-

haustible supply of metalliferous quartz, some extraordinary results.

Goitref Mine adjoins the last, the quartzose lodes of which are auriferous.

Cacgxcernog Mine adjoins Berthwllyd, and is favoured with a continuation of the

Great Champion Lode at Berthwllyd. Trials of ores from this mine have produced
Asometimes as much as 8 ounces to the ton.
                                            few days ago, the author visited the

spot for the first time, and discovered an old heap of calcined stuff upon which

were visible globules of gold. Assays of the surface lode-stuff produced from 2 to

4 dwts. to the ton.
   Cae 3Iawr Mine adjoins the Berthwllyd and Caegwernog Mines. It was here

that the first gold was discovered. Visible gold has recently been found. Assays

give from 9 to 11 dwts. to the ton of surface mineral.
   Gold is also found in the alluvium, by washing, in about the same proportions

--as at North and West Dolfrwynog.
   Benrhos Mine. The alluvium here contains specks of gold, similar to the last-

mentioned.

   Tyny-benrhos Mine adjoins the last, and contains gold in the alluvium, as above.

author had seen.

                  The Cambrian Section.

This section extends along the north side of the turnpike-road from Dolgelley

to Barmouth.
   The Cambrian Gold Mine has six remarkable blende ledes, three of which the

author knows to be highly auriferous. No. 6 lode produces gold occasionally

very rich in blende. He had himself extracted gold from the blende-ore, at the

rate of 300 ounces to the ton. There can be no question about gold being found

here in paying quantities. Very rich ore has been recently raised. One large spe-

Acimen contained gold in the slate.     very rich specimen was exhibited.

The Cicmabseijian (East Clogau) Mine is situate to the north of the Cambrian

Mine. The noticeable lode in Ihis sett is one that has the appearance of being a
continuation of the Saint David's Lcde at Clogau. The quartz is similar, and con-

tains gold on assay. Mr. Clement's analysis gives 18 dwts. 14 grs. to the ton.

   The Princess Alice Mine, situate between the Cambrian and the Prince of Wales
Mines, has given gold on assay at the rate of 8 dwts. to the ton. The lode-stuff

has the same character as the Cambrian. The author extracted gold from it in

1856.

Moel Ispri Mine, on the N.E. of the last, has yielded, it is said, at the rate of

8 ounces of gold to the ton of galena.

The Prince of Wales Mine is on the east of the Princess Alice. It has several

remarkable galena and blende lodes. Some specimens from this mine in the

author's case at the International Exhibition contain from 300 to 400 ounces of

gold to the ton. The lode-stmT will probably yield as much on the average as the

Saint David's Lode at Clogau. Seventeen ounces of gold were recently obtained
Afrom 5 cwt. of blende ore.
                             very rich specimen was exhibited.

                      The Clogatj Section.

   The now celebrated Clogau Gold Mine is situate about a mile and a half north

of the " Halfway House," on the turnpike-road from Dolgelley to Barmouth, the

most charming road in Europe.
    This property contains a large number of lodes, mineralized throughout more or

less with galena, blende, and copper-pyrites, and with the occasional occurrence of

bismuth and tellurium.
    The Saint Davids Gold Lode is the most noted, in consequence of its having

outstripped all other gold-mines of the kingdom by doing the last thing that was
predicted of it, namely " pay a profit." Of this, however, there can be but little
doubt, as, by official returns up to the 30th September last, 7892 ounces of gold
have been sold to the Bank of England, the produce of only 1091 tons of quartz !
1173| ounces of which were produced from 1072h tons of mineral in which the gold
was not visible, and the astonishing quantity of 6718J oimces from only 18 tons
17 cwt 3 qrs. 14 lbs. of quartz, realizing nearly £30,000, at a cost of some £3000,

or less ! No quartz-mining on record has given such a result. This remarkable

lode produces gold in quartz, in the 15-fathom level, at the rate of an ounce to the

 ton.

    The author stated that, in his paper of last year, he had placed on record the pro-

duct of the first hundredweight of Welsh gold. He had now to record more than

four hundredweight ; and he believed the mine, under proper management, to be
capable of producing far greater results than those just mentioned.

  A bar of gold weighing 37 ounces, part of the produce alluded to, was exhibited,

and a chain of pure gold, manufactured by Messrs. Watherston and Brogden.
   The first three quarters of the year 1862 show the following result :

brought £3 17s. per ounce, after deducting expenses for realizing same ; nett,

£20,390 15s. bd.

The Garthgell Mine is situate between the Cambrian and Clogau Mines, and

receives the lodes of both mines. The Cambrian Gold Lode runs into the sett a
few yards from the spot where visible gold is now being raised, and the Saint

David's Gold Lode has been traced on the Clogau side up to the boundary of the

Garthgell Sett. The same results as the Cambrian are expected daily. The ores

by assay give from 2 to 10 dwts. of gold to the ton at surface, and, to appearance,

Aincrease in depth.   shallow adit will cut the Cambrian Gold Lode at about

the same level as that company's present working.

Tynyeornel Farm, on the west of Clogau, has the Saint David's Lode nmning

through it. This is at present unexplored ; but as the lode on each side of the

farm is auriferous, it is more than probable that gold will be found here also.

   Hendrefonan Mine lies in the middle of the Hirgwm valley, between the Tigra
and Clogau Mountains. Gold has been produced here by assay. The indications

here are good.

  --West Clogau Mine, at Llachfraith, has yielded from a ton of quartz 17 dwts. of

fine gold about half, probably, of what it contained, when the means used to ex-

tract it are considered. The author found gold visible in the quartz here in 1856,

At nearly 150 fathoms lower than the upper level at Saint David's Gold Lode.

                                      The Vigka Section.

   The Vigra Copper Mine is situate to the west of Clogau, and takes up nearly the
whole of the Vigra Mountain. Extensive explorations have been carried on here
for copper, some of which is auriferous. The lode-stuff, taken at random, yields
nearly half an ounce of gold to the ton, on assay. Specimens have produced more
than this. Visible gold is said to have been found here. This mine ought to be
worked on a large scale for gold. The Clogau Gold Mill is erected on this property.

    Tyddyndu Mine, or as it is called " Victoria," lies between the Vigra and Clogau
Mines, to the south of Maesclawdd, and extends under the turnpike-road at Pont-
ddu to the river Mawddach. There are several lodes on this property, all of which
are auriferous. At present they are poor at surface.

   North Vigra Mine has several lodes, said to be gold-bearing.
   The Wellington Mines have some very large quartzose lodes in them, which are
undoubtedly auriferous.

  --Fach-ynys Mine. The lodes here have yielded 6 dwts. of gold to the ton at the

surface. This mine promises to be rich.
    Nant-Coch Mine has given by assay, and, singularly enough, by Britten's

Machine, 9 dwts. 13 grs. of gold to the ton of mineral.
    Llanaber Mine, near Barmouth, is also auriferous at surface.

   The known gold localities are now multiplied ; and the author added, that he

should not be at all surprised if every quartzose vein of the district is found to be
auriferous, but that it must by no means be inferred from this that every quartz-
lode will pay for working : some will not ; but where there are so many, some cer-
tainly will prove rich.

   Having said thus much upon the increased number of places in which gold is
found in this district, the author made some reference to the modes of gold-extrac-
tion now in operation.

    Notice of some Mammalian Remains from the Bed of the German Ocean.

                                By C. B. Kose, F.G.S., $c.

   It has for a very long period been known that, dining the degradation of the

cliffs of the coimties of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, teeth and bones of various

mammals have been exhumed, and, more largely, those of Pachyderms. In Queen
Elizabeth's time, huge bones were found at Walton, near Harwich. They were

then considered to be those of giants. In the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for
1745, a Mr. Baker records the finding of a fossil elephant at Mundesley Cliff; and,
in 1746, Mr. Win. Arderson, of Norwich, makes mention of similar remains dis-
covered at Hasborough and Walket, on the Norfolk coast.

   In the course of years, vast numbers of teeth and bones have been collected.

The late Mr. Woodward, of Norwich, says, in his ' Geology of Norfolk,' " Mamma-

lian remains have been dredged up on the Knole Sand off Hasborough. This spot

presented us, in 1826, with the finest tusk of the Mammoth ; it measured 9^ feet

along its curvature, and weighed 97 lbs." But off Dungeness a tusk was dredged
up which measured 11 feet in length, and yielded some pieces of ivory fit for manu-
facture. The oyster-bed off Hasborough was discovered in 1820, and, from the
number of grinders of the Elephant found there, Mr. Woodward felt himself war-

ranted in concluding that upwards of 500 animals were deposited in that limited

space.

    The coloured map of the German Ocean exhibited at the Meeting showed the

localities whence the organic remains are chiefly taken. Certain spots marked

thereon are the fishing-grounds, and, therefore, the depositories of the fossils with

which we are made familiar; but we cannot doubt that these exuviae are more

generally distributed over the sea-bottom. The following specimens were exhi-

--bited: Teeth of three species of Elephant, Elephas primigenius, E. antiquus, and

E.  meridionalis                                                 cervical and  dorsal  vertebras of the  same  genus ;  two teeth  of  a

Hippopotamus (a dorsal vertebra has since been brought up) ; a dorsal vertebra of
a Whale ; a unique specimen of a lower jaw of the Trichechus rosmarus; heads of

the Megaceros Hibernicits, male and female ; an anterior dorsal vertebra of ditto

(an antler, 4 feet 6 inches long, has since been brought me) ; atlas of ditto ; a frag-

ruent of an antler of Cervus tarandm ;  the humerus   of a gigantic  Ox                   a portion  of
                                                                                       ;
--the head of the Equus fossilis ; and a fine specimen of Castor Europaus the head.

The colour of these specimens might lead us to believe that they belonged to the

Mammaliferous Crag period ; but colour is not a decisive criterion. It is probable

that they may have lain in close proximity to a bed of crag*; they are unquestion-

ably from a Pleistocene deposit.

  And now as to how these organic remains came to be at the bottom of the

ocean. At a not very remote geological period our island was imited with the

Continent ; a catastrophe took place which separated them and led to the formation

of the German Ocean. This gap has been continually enlarging, from the crumb-
ling down of the cliffs on either side ; the fossils have thus been exhumed, carried

out to sea during storms by retiring waves, and there deposited. No doubt, also,

many remains which lie buried in the land that originally united us to the Conti-

nent sank bodily with it ; and consequently they are met with when the sea-bottom

is raked over by the trawling-nets of the fishermen.

   The sections of the Old Red Sandstone and Mountain Limestone on the Pem-
brokeshire coast are unrivalled for their extent and completeness. The vertical
beds, exposed to the coast-waves, are worn by them in such a manner as to clear
them of all detritus, and exhibit the succession of Old Red conglomerates, Carbo-

niferous shales, and Mountain limestone in several small sandy inlets accessible at
all tides, especially at the most important points, viz. the junction of the Old Red

with the superjacent shales.

   Three of these sections have been measured in detail by Sir H. De la Beche and

the corps of the Geological Survey, and are given in vol. i. of their Memoirs,

pp. 61, 100, 130.

   At Caldy Island, the Upper Old Red marls and sandstones, ending in yellow
conglomerate-beds, are covered by 400 feet of shales and limestones in an alter-
nating series, among which beds of oolite were found to be of common occurrence,
filled, down to the very base, by common Carboniferous species,--a thin band fat

the base only) exhibiting, on the west side of the island, a bed of undescribed bi-

valve shells, all, however, allied to Carboniferous forms. And a new fact was

established during this survey, viz. the presence of a band of marine Serpulae
40 feet down in the Old Red.

   The same section, bed for bed, with the characteristic thin oolite bands, and
beds of shale crowded with the Rhynchonclla plcurodon, occurs on the opposite coast
of Skrinkle Bay, another of the sections measured by Sir Henry and his assistant

Mr. Ramsay.
   About twenty miles to the westward, the small bay of West Angle opens at the

mouth of Milford Haven ; and here a sharp, faulted synclinal in the middle of the
bay permits the whole section to be seen twice in the promontories and reefs on
either side of the bay. The series of beds have changed considerably from that
seen on the opposite coast, and nearly 150 feet more shales are added to the upper

part. In these shales a very perfect cleavage is established, fully justifying the

term " Carboniferous slate " applied to this formation in Ireland by Sir R. Grif-

fith. It is the lower limestone shale of Dr. Smith, as seen at Bristol and the

Mendips. In this section, too, new bivalves occur in the basement-beds as at

Caldy Island.

   Sundry other changes are observable when this section is compared with that on
the east coast. The yellow conglomerate has disappeared ; and while red and grey

conglomerate-beds are still plentiful on the north side of the bay, on the south

side (a distance of barely a mile) scarcely a band of conglomerate can be traced in
the first 80 or 90 feet, only 25 feet of which is of a red colour at all ; the remainder
consists of grey shale, yellow sandstone, and bands of limestone, which have only

the faintest representatives on the north side. Grey shales, with plants, are mixed
with these on both sides.

The limestones are nodular, and contain crowds of Avicula Damnoniensi*, Sow.

the characteristic shell of the Uppermost Devonian beds north of Barnstaple, North
Devon (Rhynchonetta laticosta, PhilL), occurs with it, together with species of
Kucula, Axinus, Modiola, and Bellerophon, all of which are closely like, if not iden-

tical with, Barnstaple species. The Serpula-bsnA before mentioned, at Caldy Island,
occurs among these limestones, and at a somewhat greater distance below "the base

of the Carboniferous shales.

  By this remarkable change in the mineral character, accompanied by the intro-
duction of a marine fauna, we are prepared for the still greater change in the Old
Red sediments on crossing the Bristol Channel. The red tint is not, indeed, wholly

lost between Ilfracombe and Barnstaple, but is confined to a narrow belt of rocks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and the Marwood beds, which are the equivalents of the uppermost red rocks of

Pembrokeshire, are grey sandstones and olive shales, with calcareous bands, and

with no red colour at all. They represent exactly the state of things (but on a
much larger scale) above described on the south side of West Angle Bay.

   The Marwood Sandstones form a conspicuous group, ranging along a line five

miles north of Barnstaple, and traceable east and west. They are well exhibited

in the quarries at Sloly, on the Ilfracombe Road, at Marwood, Braunton, &c, and

they form the headland of Baggy Point, where the best section occurs.

Strophalosia caperata and Spirifer Barumemis throughout. (Pilton Group.)

This series (No. 4) is the upper part of the Pilton group of Professor Phillips,

and its aspect in the grand coast-section is exactly that assumed by the Carbonife-

rous shales which lie upon beds much resembling No. 3 (and with the same fossils)

in the West Angle section. The author had previously suggested this explanation

A(see Address of Pres. Geol. Soc. 1855, p. xlviii).                                 more minute comparison of the

two series convinced him that this identification (strongly advocated by Sir H. De

la Beche) was erroneous, and that the Pilton group really represents a new series,
including in an altered form the uppermost beds of the Old Red Sandstone*, toge-

ther with certain beds at the very base of the Carboniferous shales. But in the
main it is a new series, deposited in deepening water, while the Upper Old Red

area was stationary (or nearly so) and close to shore, as evidenced Try its plants.

This series of beds has been described from the South of Ireland, by Professor Jukes

and the author, under the term Coomliola Grits. It occupies there the same relative

position, overlying the true Old Red beds, and underhung the mass of the Carboni-

ferous slate.

   Some of its fossils are Carboniferous species; but most of them, though strikingly
similar, are not identical, and the presence of a common Devonian Trilobite through-

out confirms the propriety of their first reference by Murchison and Sedgwick to the

                                           * Siluria, 2nd edit. p. 300,

top of the Devonian system. The Boulogne heds chiefly belong to this series, as

does the " Spirifer- Verneuili-schiefev " of the Prussian geologists.
   It is overlain, along the course of the Barnstaple River, by the representative of

the Carboniferous slate, and this again by the Mountain-limestone series in a

greatly altered form.

   The Marwood and Pilton group, at least in part, can be thus proved by fossils to
be the actual equivalent of the Upper Old Red Sandstone, a formation which has
been found in some parts of the British Isles to be unconformable on the Lower
Old Red Sandstone.

   The identification of this Old Red Sandstone with the Devonian beds has been
a point hitherto singularly destitute of proof, though its suggestion by Lonsdale,
and subsequently by Austen, Sedgwick, and Murchison, in memoirs on Devonshire

and on the Rhine, has been generally approved.
   So little proof existed of this identity, that one of our best observers, whose re-

search had largely tended to'the establishment of the Devonian series (Mr. Godwin-

Austen), has recorded his doubts in the Geological Society's Journal (vol. ix.

p. 231), identifying the Old Red S&ndstone only with the uppermost or Marwood
beds, which Mr. D. Sharpe considered as Carboniferous ; while Mr. Sharpe himself
placed the Old Red Sandstone at the base of the Devonian system (vol. ix. p. 20,

&c).
   The fossil clue has once more unravelled a geological difficulty. Sir R. I. Mur-

chison, in reclassifying the beds of the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland (Siluria,
2nd edit. p. 285), has shown good reason for considering the order of superposition
to be as follows :--from the base,

   1. Lower Old Red, with Cephalaspis, Pteraspis, Pteryyotus.
   2. Middle Old Red, with Coccosteus, Diplopterus, Osteolejns, Pterichthys, &c.
   3. Upper Old Red, with Holoptychius, Glyptopomus, &c.
   The Upper Old Red, then, being identical with the uppermost Devonian, it
remains to be seen if we can find fossil links between the middle and lower mem-

bers of each respectively.

   It has been repeatedly shown that Coccosteus, a fish characteristic of the middle
Old Red beds, occurs in the Eifel and the Harz, in strata which belong to the
Middle Devonian ; and in Russia* it is common to have this and other genera
(Asterolepis, Dendrodus, &c.) in beds of sandstone intercalated with the marine

shells.

   There is still the Lowest Devonian zone, viz. the Spirifer-sandstone of the Rhine.

The lower sandstones and slates of Linton, in N. Devon, and of Fowey and Tor-

quay, in S. Devon, are its equivalents. In order to prove this zone identical with

--the lowest Old Red the Cornstone group, it was needful to find some at least of

the characteristic fish in it. In no Old Red locality have we any marine fossils
mixed with the Cephalaspis and Pteraspis ; but in one of the German localities

Prof. Rcemer has lately discovered, and Prof. Huxley described (Quart. Journ.

--Geol. Soc. 1861), a lai'ge species of Pteraspis a fish so exclusively characteristic

of the lowest Old Red as to leave no doubt whatever of the true correlation of the
two deposits.

   Upper, Middle, and Lower Old Red are, therefore, now linked in all their parts
by fossils with Upper, Middle, and Lower Devonian.

Elephant, obtained by the Rev. F. J. Blake from the gravel-pit at Barnwell, near
Cambridge. The specimen shows on the severed end numerous cuts, as though
made to assist in breaking the bone. The author urged that, as the condition of the

--cut surfaces was like the external surfaces as they had passed unnoticed till he
--detected them as similar cuts could not be made on fossil bones without great

care and chemical preparation, and there was nothing to suggest a doubt as to their

authenticity, the cuts were as old as the date of fossilization. And as bones are

there only found in one band of loam, it was further urged that they might be taken

as evidence of the coexistence of man in that district with the Irish Elk, Bos pri-
migenius, Elephas primigenius, Hijypopotanius major, and the other mammals of the

gravel.

On a Successful Search for Flint Implements in a Cave called " The Oyle,"

           near Tenby, South Wales. By the Rev. Gilbebt N. Smith.

This is a cave in the mountain limestone, about 70 feet above the level of the

valley beneath, up which the tide has till very recently been used to flow.

Within, it is distinguished by chambers, alternating with narrow passages, pene-

trating 30 or 40 yards into the spur of a ridgeway of the Old Red.

Floor not more than 3 feet deep anywhere, and bearing traces at the sides of a

stalagmite covering long since destroyed.

Seventy-three artificial flakes or chips were unearthed, together with the identical

lumps of flint which remained after the chips were struck off, when, from their reduced

size, they were no longer capable of yielding flakes sufficiently large to answer the

destined ptirpose.

Some of the chips are of ordinary flint ; some of a didl green, opake chert. In

size they vary from about 4 inches in length to half an inch. In general form

they are almost identical with the flakes found at Red Hill. They were dissemi-

nated through the soil of the whole cave, but much the most thickly scattered on

the floor of a recess near the entrance.

   Interspersed also with them through the soil, which in some places is nearly
black, were a great many bones. Most of these belong to such ruminants as are
now domesticated. Some are of the usual cave-mammals, as Ursus spelemis, &c.
One very fine front prong of an antler lay by itself in black earth, and has marks as

of a tool.  Length 11 inches                                                                                    circumference at base 4§ inches.
                                                                                                             ;

The lowest portion of the soil seemed quite undisturbed, down to the rock. It is

similar to the drift around the cave. Plenty of edible-mollusk shells occurred in-

termixed.

The investigator believes these flints to belong to the same human family that

raised seven or eight tumuli which exist above on the ridgeway, which contained

Jlint arrow-heads and a central kist vaen, or covered cromlech.

   He is of opinion that these flakes are the neglected refuse of the workshop, there

being no perfected flint arrow-heads among them, like those in the barrows, though

there are eight broken pieces ofperfected ones among the seventy-three specimens.
   The Welsh antiquaries here do not find mention of any weapons of stone among

--their ancient writings, except for sacrificial purposes, in accordance, this, with

Joshua v. 2, where flint knives are prescribed to circumcise, which Ligbtfoot says
was a kind of sacrifice also. The most eminent Welsh scholars have been con-

sulted by the writer.

There is no flint in the strata of this neighbourhood ; and the chert, which has

small white spots through it, and looks more like some fine kinds of trap, does not

appear in the coast-strata, although sea-borne boulders of granite and an occasional

flint may be picked up, with here and there a worn fragment of serpentine and

iridescent plutonic rock.

On the Cause of the Difference in the State of Preservation of different lands of
                     Fossil Shells. By H. C. Sobby, F.B.S., Sfc.

   The fact of certain kinds of fossil shells having lost their organic structure, or
being entirely removed, whilst in the same bed other kinds remain almost in their
original state, cannot fail to have attracted the attention of most geologists. For
example, most univalve and such bivalve shells as Trigonice, and the inner layer of
Aviculce and Spondyli, are often altered or removed, though their outer layer and
the entire shells of Ostrece and Brachiopoda are well preserved. After having
made a considerable number of experiments with recent and fossil specimens, the
author had come to the conclusion that this difference was due to the original
--96 report 1862.

difference in the state of the carhonate of lime ; and that, other conditions being
the same, shells -which were composed of calcite are preserved, whereas those
composed of arragonite have been altered. This appears to depend on the fact of

the particles of arragonite being in a state of unstable equilibrium. When prepared

artificially, it has a great tendency to pass into calcite ; and if this change took
place in shells, their organic structure would be very apt to be destroyed, though
the shell might remain as a ciystalline mass of calcite. If, however, the circum-
stances of the case were such that the calcite formed at the expense of the arrago-
nite of the shells had a greater tendency to crystallize elsewhere rather than in

situ, they would be removed, and leave more or less perfect casts. On the con-

trary, calcite having no such tendency to change, shells composed of it might,
under similar conditions, remain nearly in their original state.

     On the Comparative Structure of Artificial and Natural Igneous Rocks.

                           By H. C. Sorby, F.R.S., 6,-c.

   As is well known, Sir James Hall and Gregory Watt, by fusing and slowly cool-

ing basalt, obtained a stony mass, to a certain extent similar to the original rock.
Various writers on the subject have since contended that the product is not, like

the original, composed of several distinct minerals, but made up of only one kind
of crystals. The author, however, showed that, when thin transparent sections are
examined with a high magnifying power, it may be seen that the artificial rock is

really an aggregate of the three principal minerals of the original basalt, which,
nevertheless, are developed and arranged in such a very different manner that it is

easy to understand why this fact has been overlooked. Indeed, the difference in

general structure is so considerable that, probably, other causes besides a slower
cooling were instrumental in producing the peculiar characters of the natural rocks.

  On Scutes of the Labyrinthodon, from the Keuper Bone-Breccia of Pendoch,

            Worcestershire. By the Kev. W. S. Symonds, M.A., F.G.S.

   The remains of this Triassic reptile have been found in the Keuper sandstone of
Warwick and Leamington, but had not hitherto been detected in the Trias of
Worcestershire or Gloucestershire. The scutes and bones found by Mr. Symonds
were submitted "to Prof. Huxley. They occur chiefly in the "bone-breccia," de-
scribed by Mr. Symonds in the ' Transactions of the Geological Society,' and are
associated with numerous spines of fishes.

         On the Geology of a Part of Sligo. By A. B. Wyxxe, F.G.S.

   In this paper the author stated that he had put together a few notes upon an
extensive district. They were made during a short tour to the co. Sligo and part
of Leitrim, in the summer of 1862 ; and he alluded to papers by Sir R. Griffith,
Archdeacon Verschovle, and Mr. John Kelly, in the ' Proceedings of the Geological

Society,' all of which referred to the country under consideration. He then pro-

ceeded to describe the district as composed of a widely spread, nearly horizontal series
of stratified rocks, consisting of sandstones below and above, with a thick band of
limestones interstratified with other sandstones between. This horizontal group
represents the Carboniferous formation, from the Millstone-grit downwards, and

probably a part of the underlying Old Red Sandstone ; and the thickness of the

group is little less than 2000" feet, roughly estimated from the heights of the
mountains formed by these rocks. Cutting across the country formed by these hori-

zontal beds is the rugged chain of the Ox Mountains, extending from Mayo into
the co. Leitrini. Some of the most picturesque valleys in the district, like that of
Lough Gill, are the lateral ones along the fianks of the Ox chain, which, being

formed of gneissose, micaceous, and quartzose rocks, have a totally different aspect
from the mountains formed of the limestone and other horizontal beds. The ser-
pentine garnet rock and trap-rocks of these older mountains were next alluded to,
and it was stated that, although they seemed to occupy fissures running in various
opposite directions, their master-joints or divisional planes were nearly parallel.

The denudation which exposed the Ox Mountains, and removed the thick series of
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                  97

Carboniferous rocks which curves round the eastern end of the chain, was alluded
to ; and the circumstance of the occurrence of beds of sandstone interstratified in the
limestone portion of the horizontal group was given as an instance of the splitting
up of the Carboniferous formation into alternations of numerous arenaceous and
calcareous strata, as observed in the northern parts of the British Isles. The
limestone was stated to be traversed by greenstone trap-dykes, and metalliferous
mineral deposits were stated to occur at Lurganboy, King's Mountain, &c.

   In conclusion, the drift was alluded to, and sea-shells were stated to have been
found therein, in one place at a considerable depth, and at a distance of two miles
from the sea ; and the horns and skulls, &c, of deer and other extinct animals were
mentioned as overlying this deposit, or being just within it. The paper was illus-
trated by drawings of different portions of the country, and a list of the fossils sent

for determination to W. H. Baily, F.G-.S., was appended.

        On the Ennobling of Roots, with particular reference to the Parsnip.
                        By James Bt/ckman, F.L.S., F.G.S., fyc.

   The author, in this paper, explained the processes which he had adopted to convert
the woody-branched root of the wild parsnip into the smooth, succulent, fusiform

root of the esculent parsnip.

   The growth of wild seed was commenced in 1847, in prepared garden-ground,
and roots carefully selected and transplanted for the next generation, and so on,
selecting roots for seeding until the desired form was attained. This new variety
of parsnip is now well known to the gardener under the name of the Student
Parsnip*. The author concludes that his experiments with parsnips suificiently
show that this esculent, as well as the carrot, beet, turnip, &c, have nowhere in
the wild state that large, fleshy, smooth appearance which belongs to their cul-
tivated forms ; and hence, that all the varieties of these that we meet with in
cultivation must be considered as derivatives from original wild forms, attained by

cultivative processes.

   He states that the facility with which new sorts can be induced, and the con-

stancy with which they are maintained, under great diversities of soil, climate, and
treatment, are evidences of the derivative or ennobled nature of our crop plants,
which are indeed maintained by the very changes to which their aboriginals have
been subjected.

       Experiments with Seed of Malformed Roots.

         By James Buckman, F.L.S., F.G.S., 6fc.

   In this paper it was shown, as the result of direct experiment, that seed derived
from malformed, i. e. misshapen, crop-roots of both turnips and parsnips resulted
in even greater deformities than those presented by the parent.

   Thus, a much-forked root of parsnip and another of a swede were selected for
seeding, the produce of each being sown in plots side by side with that of good
roots, the result of which was that in both instances the bad seed produced only
about half the weight of the good, and all the examples of roots from the bad seed
were misshapen in a most extraordinary manner.

   From these experiments the author draws the following conclusions :
   1. That a degenerate progeny will, as a rule, result from the employment of

degenerate or badly-grown seed.
   2. That, besides ugly, malformed roots, degenerate seed does not produce nearly

the weight of crop of good seed imder the same circumstances of growth.

3. That, by means of selection, we may produce roots that are well shaped and

have the capabilities of yielding the best crop.

  4. That, by designedly selecting malformed or degenerate roots for seeding, we

may produce a seed that will result in a great or greater degeneracy.

The bearings of this subject are of interest, not only in a physiological point of

view, but in the more practical  one  concerned  in  every-day cultivation                                                                                    for upon

a due observance of the principles involved will depend the stability or permanency

of any particular sort ; and as sorts are only arrived at as the result of great care

(that is, by successful breeding), so care must be taken for then- maintenance.

   This district is composed of the Upper Carboniferous Limestone, and is remark-
able as being the habitat of many rare and interesting plants. Certain lines were

laid down on the map, representing the limit of the ranges of these plants

through the district. Among others, the author enumerated and commented briefly

on the following : Arabis hirsuta, Arenaria verna, CerasHum arcense, Geranium
sangtuneum, Rubus saxatilis, Rubia peregrina, Galium pusillum, Galium boreale,
As'perida cynanchica, Melampyrum sylvaticnm, Orchis pyramidalis, var. fiore pleno,
T/ialictrum majus and minus, Helianthemum canum, Spircea jilipenlula, Dryas
octopetala, Sechim rhodiola, Arbutus uva-ursi, Pyrola media, Gentiana verna, Oro-
banche rubra, Epipactis ovalis (of Babington), Potcntilla fruticosa, Adiantum capillar

Veneris.

The last-mentioned plant (the beautiful Maiden-hair Fern) occurs in great
Aabimdance in several separate stations in Burren.
                                                     few years ago it was only

recorded as plentiful from the South Isles of Arran, and sparingly from Conne-

mara and Cahirconree Mountain, county Kerry.

  On the Toot-poison of New Zealand. Bii W. Lauder Lindsay, M.D. and

   During a tour through the New Zealand provinces in 1801-1862, the author

was struck with the abundant evidences which everywhere presented themselves
of the ravages produced among the flocks and herds of the settlers by the Toot-

plant, one of the most common indigenous shrubs of these islands. In many cases
of losses by individual settlers brought under his notice, the amoimt from this

source alone had been from 25 to 75 per cent. In Otago particularly were such
losses felt during the height of the gold mania there, from July to December

1861 : the traffic between Dimedin and Tuapeka gold-fields required the service of
large numbers of bullocks, a great proportion of which were lost by Toot -poisoning.
In colonies which as yet, at least, have depended for their prosperity almost solely
on pastoral enterprise, such losses form a material barrier to prosperity ; and the

concurrent testimony of the colonists in every part of New Zealand proves the great

 desirability of determining the nature of the Toot-poison, the laws of its action on

man and the lower animals, and its appropriate antidotes or modes of treatment.
 With a view to assist in the attainment of these aims, the author had made notes,

-- --on the spot, of a large number of instances of the poisonous or fatal action of the

plant on man adults as well as children and the lower animals, and had brought
 specimens home for chemical examination. The chief results of his investigations
may be thus stated :

1. The Toot-poison belongs to the class of Narcotico-irritants,

--a. Its action on man includes the following symptoms : coma, with or without

delirium ; sometimes great muscular excitement or convulsions, the details differ-

ing in different individuals ; during convalescence, loss of memory, with or with-

out vertigo.

b. In cattle and sheep, they include vertigo, stupor, delirium, and convulsions

curious staggerings and gyrations; frantic kicking, and racing or coursing;

tremors.

2. The poisonous portion of the plant,

a. To man, is generally the Seed, which is contained in a beautiful, dark purple,

luscious berry, resembliug the blackberry, which clusters closely in rich pendent

racemes, and which is most tempting to children                                                                                                                                                                                      occasionally the young Shoots of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

the plant, as it grows up in spring :

b. To cattle and sheep, in almost all cases, is the young Shoot, which is tender

and succulent, resembling in appearance and taste the similar state of asparagus.

3. The following Peculiarities exist in regard to the action of the Toot-poison :

A«. predisposition must exist, such predisposition being produced in cattle and

sheep by some of the following conditions or circumstances :--The animal is not

habituated to the use of the plant ; it suddenly makes a large meal thereof after

long fasting, or long feeding on drier and less palatable materials, or after exhaus-

tion by hard labour or hot, dry weather. From some such cause, the digestive

system is deranged, and is susceptible of more serious disorder from the inges-

tion of food to which the animal is, at the time, unaccustomed. Hence Toot-

poisoning frequently occurs in animals which have just been landed from a long

and fatiguing sea-voyage during which they have been underfed or starved, to

whom the young Toot-shoots present the most juicy, fresh, pleasant diet,

   b. On the other hand, the same kinds of animals, habituated to the use of the

Toot-plant, not only do not suffer at all, but for them it is regarded as quite equal

in value to, and as safe as, clover as a pastoral food. It is an equal favourite

with cattle and sheep, whether they have been habituated or not.

   c. The predisposition in man is probably produced by analogous conditions

depressing the tone of his nervous and digestive systems, or directly deranging

them. Children are affected out of all proportion to adults.

   d. Adults who have suffered from the poisonous action of Toot under certain

--circumstances have been exempt from such action under certain others the same

parts of the plant having been used, and apparently in the same way, in both sets
of instances: Moreover, the Toot-berries enjoy, both among the Maoris and

colonists, an enviable notoriety on account of the agreeable and harmless wine and

jellies thev are capable of yielding, the former whereof especially has long been
greatly prized. The seeds, however, in these cases probably do not enter into

the composition of the said wine and jellies.

--4. The current Remedies for Toot-poisoning among the settlers are, in regard to

a. Cattle and sheep mainly bleeding, by slashing the ears and tails. Bella-

donna has been  variously tried, and   favourably reported                                                                                                                                                                           on              by others,  stimulants
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

are regarded as specifics (carbonate of ammonia, brandy, or a mixture of gin and

turpentine, locally known as "Drench "_). Whatever be the nature of the remedy,

there is no difference of opinion as to the necessity for the promptest treatment,

since, at a certain stage of the action of the poison, all remedies appear equally

inefficacious.

b. In man the nature of the remedy is still more varied, though emetics and

stimulants seem the most rational of those usually had recourse to.

5. The Toot- or 7W«-plant is the Coriaria ruscifolia, L. (the C. sarmentosa,

Forst). The plant is variously designated by Maoris and settlers in different parts
Newof the
           Zealand islands ; and this of itself indicates how familiar it is, and how

abundantly and widely distributed. The genus Coriaria is a small one, and, if

not belonging to a subdivision of the natural order Ochnacece, probably represents

a separate order closely allied thereto and to the Rvtacete. The most distin-

guished botanists, however, are at issue as to its precise place and alliances in the

vegetable system. They are in similar dubiety as to the species of the genus, and

Newthe varieties of the species C. ruscifolia, L. In                                                                                                                                                                                 Zealand there appear to be

--100 REPORT 1862.

at least three Cwiarias, which some botanists regard aa mere varieties of C. rusci-
folia, It., and others consider separate species. The author had made, in July
1862 an examination of all the species of the genus Coriaria contained in the
Hookerian and Benthamian Collections at Kew, the result whereof was a strong
conviction of the necessity for a critical revision of the whole genus, throughout all
its species, wherever distributed. The author considers the specific names of the
Toot-plant (both rttscifolia and sarmentosa) objectionable, as not truly applicable or

--descriptive ; and proposes the specific term C. tutu the Maori name of the plant,

as more convenient to indicate the type of the species, leaving such terms as
ruscifolia, thymifolia, and sarmentosa to represent varieties or other species, as a

subsequent critical examination of the genus may render necessary or desirable.

    In contrast to, and in connexion with the toxic action of C. ruscifolia, the
author remarked on the better-known poisonous properties of C. myrtifolia, familiar

Heas an adulterant of senna, and on those of other species of the genus Coriaria.

annoimced his belief that the whole genus Coriaria must be considered endowed
with poisonous properties, probably of the narcotico-irritant class, and that, as such
(especially in reference to the extent and importance of the economic losses caused
by such species as Toot), it is eminently deserving of thorough scientific investi-

gation.

    Under this head he pointed out the fact that
    a. While certain animals seem to be themselves exempt from, or insusceptible
 to the action of the poison, they may, by feeding upon certain species, or certain,
 parts of certain species of Coriaria, and assimilating thereby or secreting the con-
 tained poison in their tissues, communicate poisonous effects, or become poisons,

to man or the lower animals, to which they (the animals first mentioned) have
become articles of diet. He cited a recent instance in connexion with C. myrtifolia,

 in which several persons, near Toulouse, were poisoned by a dish of snails which
 had been fattened on its leaves and shoots *.

    b. That Royle in reference to the fruit of C. Nepalensis, Peschier of Geneva in
 regard to C. myrtifolia, and other authorities in regard to other species of Coriaria,
 have published instances of their harmless or even beneficial effects, under certain

 circumstances, on man or the lower animals. Such conflicting statements would

 appear to indicate that there are peculiarities in the action of the poisonous prin-
 ciples of all the Coriarias, or discrepancies in the records of instances of the said

 action, which discrepancies or peculiarities demand reconciliation or explanation
 at the hands of competent scientific experts.

 On the Occurrence o/AspIenium viride on an Isolated Travertine RocJc among
      the Black Mountains of Monmouthshire. By the Eev. W. S. Symonds.

    Mr. Symonds drew attention, at the Meeting of the British Association held at
 Oxford in June I860, to the selection of a peculiar geological habitat by some of
 the rarer British plants. Asplenium viride was found in 1862, by Mr. George Roberts,
 of the Geological Society of London, growing in considerable abundance on an
 isolated rock of travertine, Capel-le-fin, Llanthony, Monmouthshire. This Asplenium
 is not known elsewhere in the district.

On the Structure of Corymorpha nutans. By Professor Allman, M.D., F.R.S.

   The body of the polype was described as presenting a continuous cavity as far
back as the zone of posterior tentacula. From the floor of this cavity a large
conical mass of vacuolated en doderm projects forwards, and nearly fills the posterior

wider part of the cavity, whose extension backwards seems at first sight not to be
continued beyond the zone of posterior tentacula. There is here, however, in reality,

no interruption of the general body-cavity ; for the axis of the conical projecting
mass of endoderm is perforated by a channel, which thus continues the cavity back-

wards to the summit of the stem.

  A system of inosculating longitudinal tubular vacuolse was described as existing

in the stem : they are indicated externally by the longitudinal coloured lines visible
even by the naked eye. At the summit of the stem they coalesce and become con-

tinuous with the cavity of the body. In these tubes, distinct currents, similar to

those so lono- known in the stem of Tubularia indivisa, were occasionally very per-

ceptible under the microscope.

    Under a high power of the microscope, delicate parallel longitudinal striae may

be  detected,  lying  externally  to  the  tubular  vacuolar                                          they are  situated  between
                                                                                                   ;

the ectoderm and endoderm, and may be traced upwards on the body of the polype

as far at least as the zone of posterior tentacula ; they seem to consist of fine tubu-

lar fibres, and are apparently the equivalent of the fibres (muscular ?) visible beneath

the ectoderm of Clava, Coryne, &e. Still finer circular strias may also be occasion-

ally witnessed under a high power running transversely round the stem; but the

author could not determine whether these represent fibres or mere rugae in the

ectoderm.

   The gonophores are medusiform, and were described as belonging to the generic
type of Steeustrupia (Forbes). They were liberated in abundance from the specimens
examined. The generative elements were not visible in any of the medusoids at
the time of their liberation ; but the author obtained from the same part of the sea
where the Corymorpha occurred a free Steenstmpia, a little larger than the medusoids
of the present species at the time when they become detached, and which he
did not hesitate to consider as specifically identical with them, and in this the
generative elements were quite distinct between the ectoderm and endoderm of the

manubrium.
   The species of Corymorpha which constituted the subject of this communication

was considered by the author as identical with C. nutans (Sars), though it does not
entirely agree with the diagnosis of that species as given by Sars. It was discovered

in the Frith of Forth last summer.

   On some neiv British Tubularidae. By Professor Allman, M.D., F.R.S.

   The author gave the following diagnoses of new species of Tubularidee which he
had obtained during the autumn of 1862 on the coasts of Shetland and Devonshire.

    Clava diffusa (mihi). Polypes about £ of an inch in height, light rose-colour,
developed at intervals upon a creeping- reticulated stolon ; tentacula about twenty.
Gonophores scattered, commencing just behind the posterior tentacula, and thence

of the polype. In rock-pools at low-water spring-tides. Out Skerries, Shetland

Isles.

    Tubiclava (mihi, nov. gen.). Polype claviform, supported on the summit of free
stems, which rise at intervals from a creeping stolon and are invested by a chiti-
nous periderm ; tentacula filiform, scattered. Gonophores, dense clusters of sporo-
sacs aggregated immediately behind the posterior tentacula._

    Tubiclava lucerna (mihi). Zoophytes about 2 lines in height ; stems quite sim-

pie, or rarely with a short lateral branch ; periderm clothing the stem corrugated,

dilated at the base of the polype : pale yellowish brown. Polype, when extended,

about equal to the stem in height ; white, with pale ochreous centre ; tentacula
about twenty, confined to the anterior third of the polype. Creeping over the sur-

face of loose stones in the bottom of a rock-pool, Torquay. On stones between tide-

marks, Dublin Bay.
   Eudendrium humile (mihi). Zoophyte delicate, rising to about fths of an inch

in height, much and irregularly branched ; main stems and branches distinctly

annulated throughout. Polype yellowish vermilion, vase-shaped, with a circular
groove near its base and a trumpet-shaped proboscis ; tentacula twenty or twenty-
three, with the alternate ones elevated and depressed in extension. Gonophores
(male) sunounding the body of the polype, and springing each by a short stalk
from the circular groove which passes round the polype near its base, each gono-
phore consisting of two superimposed chambers. Female gonophores borne both
by the base of the polype and by the ccenosarc immediately behind it. Rooted to
the bottom of rock -pools near low-water spring-tides, Torquay.

   Eudendrium vaginal um (mihi). Zoophyte much branched, rising to about an
inch and a quarter in height : main stems and branches deeply and regularly annu-

lated throughout. Polypes vermilion, with about eighteen tentacuki, and having
the body, as far as the origin of the tentacula, enveloped in a loose, corrugated
membranous sheath, which loses itself posteriorly upon the polypary. Gonophores
not known. In rock-pools at extreme low-water spring-tides, Shetland.

    Perigonimus serpens (mihi). Zoophyte consisting of short, simple, erect stems,
about 2 lines in height, terminated by the polypes, and rising at short intervals
from a creeping stolon, which forms an irregular network upon the surface of other
bodies, the whole of the stems and stolon occupied by a reddish-orange ccenosarc,
and clothed with a delicate transparent periderm, which does not fomi a cup-like
dilatation at the base of the polypes. Polypes reddish orange, with about twelve
or fourteen tentacula, so disposed that in complete extension they are held with
alternate tentacula elevated and depressed ; body of polype oval, with proboscis coni-
cal. Gonophores medusiferous, borne by the creeping stolon, and elevated each upon
a rather long peduncle. Medusoids dome-shaped, with the vertical slightly exceeding

the transverse diameter. Manubrium reaching to about one-half the depth of the
bell, with a simple mouth destitute of tentacula ; marginal tentacula two, opposite,
very extensile, and with large reddish-orange bulbous bases, without evident ocelli,

the intermediate radiating canals terminating each in a very small bulbous dilata-

tion. Growing over the sterns of Plumuhiria setacea; dredged from about 12

fathoms, Torbay.

   Perigonimus minutus (mihi). Zoophyte very minute, consisting of simple stems
rising to the height of about a line and a half from a creeping stolon, and bearing
the polypes upon their summit periderm dilated round the base of the polype.

                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Polypes ash-brown, with seven or eight, rarely twelve tentacula, held irregularly
during extension, and with little or no curvature. Gonophores pyriform, medusi-
ferous, borne at various heights upon the stem, and supported on rather long peduncles.
Medusoid with the summit suddenly contracted, so as to give a somewhat conical
form to the umbrella ; two opposite radiating canals terminating each in a pale-
brown bulb which is continued into a very extensile filiform tentaculum, the alter-

nate two canals terminating each in a much smaller bulb without tentacle ; no
evident ocellus ; manubrium short, with a four-lobed lip, but without oral tentacula.
Forming a fringe round the edge of the operculum of Turritclla communis dredged
in Busta Voe, Shetland. Out of between twenty and thirty specimens of living
Turritella examined, not one was free from this remarkable little zoophyte.

   Perigonimus muscus (mihi). Zoophyte consisting of numerous erect stems about
\ an inch in height, not composed of coalesced tubes, springing at intervals from a
creeping stolon, and sending off short branches, which are themselves, for the most
part, without further ramification: periderm light brown, slightly corrugated, and
with a well-marked cup-like dilatation at the base of the polype. Polypes semi-
retractile, light reddish brown, with about sixteen tentacula directed in extension
alternately backwards and forwards. Gonophores medusiferous, borne upon a rather
long peduncle, and springing from the branches at a short distance behind the

polype. Medusoid dome-shaped, with the four radiating canals terminating below

each in a large reddish bulb which sends off two very extensile filiform tentacula,

having an ocellus at the base of each ; manubrium extending to about a third of
the entire depth of the umbrella, and with four short oral tentacula. The medu-
soid is thus, in all points, undistinguishable from that of Perigonimus ramosus, Van

Beneden. In a rock-pool, Torquay, where it occurred abundantly, creeping over

the bottom in small moss-like tufts.
    Titbularia bellis (mihi). Basal portion of ccenosarc prostrate, creeping, and

Observations of the Habits of the Aye-aye living in the Gardens of the Zoolo-

           gical Society, Regent's Park, London. By A. D. Baktlett.

   The subject of the following remarks is a fine adult female of the Aye-aye (Chi-
romys maaayascariensis), which arrived in this country on the 12th of August last.
On the voyage this animal produced a young one, which lived about ten days. On
arriving here she was in poor condition and very feeble ; she soon, however, began
to feed freely, and has now considerable strength, as is shown by the timber destroyed
in the cage in which she is kept.

   This animal is much blacker, and appears larger, than the male of this species
now in the British Museum ; the long hairs on the back of the neck, extending to

the lower part of the body, have white points ; these white points are thickest
above, and become less numerous towards the limbs and tail, which appear quite
black ; the hairs of the tail, however, are white or grey at the roots (this can only
be observed by separating them) ; the chin and throat are dirty white, which colour
extends over the chest ; the short hairs on the face are a mixture of dirty grey and
white, the long hairs are black ; the eye slight brown, surrounded by dark-coloured
hairs the nose and muzzle are of a dirty flesh-colour, the lips pink ; the ears

                               ;

shining black and naked, but thickly studded with small protuberances ; the feet
and toes are sooty black, with the under surface and claws lighter, inclining to

flesh-colour. The situation of the mammse is remarkable : they are two in number,

and placed at the lowest part of the abdomen (the animal differing in this respect
entirely from the Lemurs and Bats, the teats of which are on the breast).

   The Aye-aye sleeps during the day, and the body is then generally curved round
and lying on its side ; the tail is spread out and flattened over it, so that the head
and body of the animal are almost entirely covered by the tail.

   It is only at night that the Aye-aye exhibits any activity. I hear her crawling
about and gnawing the timber when, to me, all is perfectly dark ; and I have been
surprised to find that upon the introduction of a light, directed to the face of the
animal, she does not exhibit any signs of uneasiness, but stretches out her arm and
tries to touch the lamp with her long fingers. She frequently hangs by her hind
legs, and in this position cleans and combs out her large tail, using the slender
hook-like third finger with great rapidity, reminding one strongly of the movements
of the large Bats (Pteropus). This skeleton-like finger is used with great address
in cleaning her face and picking the comers of the eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and
other parts of her body ; during these operations the other fingers are frequently

partially closed.

   In feeding, the left hand only is used, although she has the fidl use of her right
one. The mode of taking her food requires careful attention, in consequence of
the very rapid movement of the hand during the process. The fourth finger (which
--104 REPORT 1862.

is the longest and largest) is thrust forward into the food, the slender third finger
is raised upwards and backwards above the rest, while the first finger or thumb is
lowered, so as to be seen below and behind the chin ; in this position the hand is
drawn backwards and forwards rapidly, the inner side of the fourth finger passing
between the lips, the head of the animal being held sideways, thus depositmg the
food in the mouth at each movement; the tongue, jaws, and lips are kept in full
motion all the time. Sometimes the animal will advance towards and lap from the
dish like a cat, but this is unusual. I have never heard her utter any cry, or pro-

duce any vocal sound, during the many hours at night in which I have watched

her habits, nor has she appeared shy or angry at my presence.

   With reference to food, this creature exhibits no inclination to take any kind of

insects, but feeds freely on a mixture of milk, honey, eggs, and any thick, sweet,
glutinous Jluid, rejecting meal-wonus, grasshoppers, the larvae of wasps, and all

similar objects. Consequently I am inclined to think that this animal is not
insectivorous. Its large and powerfid teeth lead me to infer that it may possibly
wound trees, and cause them to discharge their juices into the cavity made by its
teeth, and that upon this fluid it probably feeds. This appears to me the more

likely, as I observe that our specimen returns frequently to the same spot on the

tree which she had previously injured. I am also strengthened in my opinion by

noticing the little attention paid by the animal to its food. It does not watch or
look after it ; for I have on several occasions removed the vessel containing its food

--during the time the animal was feeding, and the creature continued to thrust its

hand forward, as before, upon the same spot though after a while, finding no
more food, she discontinued, and moved oft to search for more elsewhere. This
apparently stupid act is so unlike the habits of an animal intended to capture or

feed on living creatures that I am inclined to believe that the Aye-aye feeds upon
inanimate substances. I have frequently seen it eat a portion of the bark and wood

after taking a quantity of the fluid food.

   The excrement of this animal much resembles the dung of small rabbits, being

in separate nearly round balls.

    On Marriages of Consanguinity. By Gilbert W. Child, M.B. Oxon.
   Two opposite views of the effect of the above marriages have been held--

    (1.) That they are unnatural, and entail degeneracy upon their ofl'spring as a
natural consequence, and independently of the ordinary" laws of inheritance.

   (2.) That they are not contrary to any law of nature ; and that when ill conse-

quences are observed to follow them, they do so by ordinary inheritance only.

   Two kinds of evidence have been employed in investigating this subject
   (1.) That derived from observation and statistics in the case of human beings, and
    (2.) From carefully recorded experiments in the case of animals.

    The former tends somewhat to support the first opinion, and the latter the second.
   Upon criticism of the evidence of the former kind, it appears that the results of
various observers are inconsistent with one another, and that in one instance a
similar investigation has shown worse results to be produced from the intermarriage
of natives of different European countries than those alleged to have followed from

the marriages of blood-relations. Further, the impossibility of obtaining correct
family histories is sufficient to invalidate all evidence of the kind in such cases as

the present. On the other hand, the evidence from the breeding of animals is clear
and conclusive up to the point that animals are known to have been bred with a
degree of closeness physically impossible in the human race, without any apparent

 degeneracy. This evidence is open to one serious objection, viz. that the animals
 so pred are subject to careful selection, which is impossible in the case of mankind.
 This is an objection, in fact, not against consanguineous marriages altogether, but
 against such marriages between unhealthy persons, and proceeds on the hypothesis
 that the ordinary laws of inheritance affect close-bred animals equally with others.
 It is therefore consistent with the second opinion, and inconsistent with the first.

    The remainder of the paper was occupied by the relation of several observations
 upon mankind made in the Mediterranean, the Scottish islands, in Cornwall, and
 elsewhere by Dr. Davy, and kindly communicated by him to the writer, all of which
 tend to show that many instances are to be found in which inhabitants of isolated

districts, known to intermarry closely, are seen to be in possession of more than
average health ; also by one case observed by the writer in a race of cats, in which

certain peculiarities were found to reappear in the third generation, after at least

two successive distinct crosses.
   The writer's conclusions are as follows :

   1. That statistical evidence from observation of man is peculiarly inapplicable

to questions of the kind under discussion.
   2. That the evidence in favour of the opinion that close breeding is contrary to

a law of nature is highly unsatisfactory.
   3. That there is positive evidence, from the results of recorded observations upon

animals, that no such law affects them i. e., that where the causes of degeneracy

are absent, any degree of close breeding may exist without producing ill effects ; and

therefore,

   4. Unless we are prepared to believe in two distinct physiologies, the same must
be true of the human race.

   5. It will remain an interesting question, how far reasoning similar to the above

will be found to affect the views recently put forward by Mr. Darwin, in his work
on the fertilization of Orchids.

On Ribs and Transverse Processes, with special relation to the Theory of the
                        Vertebrate Skeleton. By Dr. Cleland.

   In the first part of this paper, the points were sought to be shown in which pre-
vailing theories were untenable when compared with the phenomena exhibited by

ribs and transverse processes in different classes of Vertebrata.

According to the writer of the paper, all morphological discussions resolve them-

selves into investigations of the relative amount of significance attachable to different

Weclasses of phenomena.  compare structures, and inquire in what respects they

differ and in what they correspond. The question then arises, what points of dif-

ference or correspondence are of primary importance, and what points are only
subordinate ? The importance of such points can only be estimated by their pre-

valence in a series of animals, and the time of their appearance in the embrvo.

Now, looked at in the earliest condition, the embryo is developed from a portion of
the germinal membrane split up into layers, which fold inwards to complete the

outline of the body in such a manner that the innermost layer forms the epithelial

lining of the intestine and appendages, while the outermost layer forms the cuticle,

together with the brain and spinal cord. The spinal cord is thus originally super-

ficial, and it only becomes deeply placed in consequence of processes, projected from

the middle and superficial layers, rising on each side of it and uniting in the

middle line. On the other hand, the visceral cavity is not bounded by processes

projected from the opposite aspect of these layers, but by the layers themselves

therefore the visceral ring cannot be appropriately compared to the neural ring,

which is formed merely of two radiations given off from the visceral ring. Yet the

prevailing theories, according to which the ribs and transverse processes of mammals,

birds, reptiles, and fishes are compared, e. g. those of Muller and Owen, require us to

believe that the skeleton is so planned round the bodies of the vertebrae, that the

neural arch on the dorsal aspect corresponds to the visceral arch on the ventral
--106 REPORT 1862.

aspect. That condition is only found in the tail ; and the tail is not a typical por-
tion of the body, but a degenerated series of segments, in which the products of the
deepest parts of the embryo are entirely unrepresented.

   With regard to the series of structures traced back into the tail, it was shown that

structures lying in series were not necessarily strictly homologous, that, in fact,
correspondence was a thing of degree, and that inferior arches of caudal vertebrae
were found in series sometimes with mesial spines, sometimes with vessel-embracing
arches, sometimes with costal arches of trunk-vertebrae, and sometimes with more
than one of these. The key to the comprehension of the skeleton was maintained
to lie in the double relation of the skeleton of the trunk to the visceral cavity and

--chorda dorsalis, both being to it centres, but in different senses the visceral cavity

being that which it tended to encircle, the chorda dorsalis the line from which its

efforts to encircle the visceral cavity began.

   The correspondence of inferior caudal arches of one class of Vertebrata to those
of other classes was shown to be of primary importance ; and their differences in
respect of attachment, and of the structures with which they were in series, of

secondary importance.
   All transverse processes or ribs tending to embrace the visceral cavity were

shown to have a primary correspondence, even though attached to different parts of
the vertebrae, and to be more closely allied one with another than to any structure
projecting into the muscles, such as the superior transverse processes and ribs of
fishes. (This paper is published in full in the ' Nat. Hist, Eeview ' for Jan. 1863.)

On Geoffroy St.-Hilaire's Distinction between Catarrhine and Platyrrhine
               Quadrumana. By Dr. Collingwood, Liverpool.

The terms applied long since by this eminent French naturalist are of great

general importance, and point out very characteristic distinctions ; but the defini-

tions universally given of those terms are such as to make the terms themselves

appear liable to mimerous exceptions. Thus, the Old-World Monkeys possess

nasal  septa varying  from \ inch   Semnopithecus) to  i inch  in  thickness    Colobus)

                                   (                                          (;

while in those of the New World, although the septum is sometimes (Cebus)

f inch thick, in other instances it does not exceed ^ inch (Uriodes). Neither
do the definitions " nostrils opening beneath (or in front of) the nose," and

" nostrils opening to the side of the nose," apply by any means generally. It

appears as though the spirit of St.-Hilaire's distinctions were quite forgotten by

his successors, who have endeavoured to connect all the Quadrumana under a

Procrustean rule. Typical animals fulfil, for the most part, the definitions given
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but aberrant genera wander in this respect, as in others, from the ordinary defini-

tions. It is to the form of the septum itself, in its anterior aspect, that we must

--look for the real basis of St.-Hilaire's distinctions that form being wedge-shaped

in the Monkeys of the Old World, and hourglass-shaped in those of the American

continent. This causes all the curious changes of direction which the nostrils

undergo, and is without exception. Hence it results that in Catarrhine Quadru-

--mana the lower angles of the nostrils rapidly converge over the mouth, while those

of the Platyrrhine Monkeys diverge a test which, while it is most readily applied

and is not liable to misinterpretation, is at the same time altogether independent

of the thickness of the nasal septum.

 On the Change of Form of the Head of Crocodiles ; and on the Crocodiles of
                     India and Africa, By' Dr. J. E. Grat, F.R.S.

   The author stated that the Crocodile, when first hatched, has the front of the face
short and rounded, even in those that have an elongated beak in the adult state. The
nose of the different species lengthens, and gradually assumes the form which is the

character of the kind; and it is at this age that the peculiar forms of the different
kinds are best examined and compared. After the animal has assumed its adult
size, the bones of the head dilate on the side, and the forehead and nose become
more swollen. The change of form thus produced is so great, that some naturalists
have regarded them as distinct species. This dilatation of the sides and increase in

thickness of the hones of the head are doubtless for the support of the large teeth

which are developed as these animals attain their adult age. The author observed,

that this was a good instance, as showing the necessity of studying all kinds of

animals in all their stages of growth, and under different circumstances. He stated

that no species could be said to have been properly observed until all these circum-

stances had been examined and noted; and that though the notice of a single

individual or state of an animal was useful, it could only be regarded as a sign-

post, indicating the existence of an animal which required further study and

examination. Pie then proceeded to speak of the African Crocodile. He observed,

that Adanson mentioned three crocodiles as found in the Senegal. Cuvier, in his

monograph, thinks that Adanson had made some mistake, and makes some very

severe remarks on the inaccuracies of travellers ; but more recent researches had
shown that in this case the traveller was correct, and the philosopher at fault.

Adanson mentions the Green and the Black Crocodiles and the Gavial of Senegal.

There can be no doubt, from the West-African specimens which are in the British

Museum, that Cuvier was right in regarding the Green Crocodile as the crocodile

also found in the rivers in the northern and southern parts of Africa. Cuvier, on

the other hand, considered the Black Crocodile of Adanson was identical with the

Alligator with bony eyebrows found in South America. This is not the case ; for

there is a Black Crocodile found in West Africa, which is often imported into

Liverpool ; and there are specimens in the British and Liverpool Museums, and

some young ones living in the Zoological Gardens in the Regent's Park : it is a

true crocodile, but peculiar from having three long plates in the eyelids ; and it was

probably this peculiarity that misled Cuvier. It is to be observed, that the French

naturalists have not yet discovered this fact ; for the author stated that he had

recently purchased from the French Museum the skeleton of this African Black

Crocodile under the name of Alliyator palpebrosm from the Brazils; and there was

little doubt that it must have been the examination of the skull of this animal that

induced some zoologists to believe that some specimens of alligators had the teeth

sometimes fitted into notches in the margin, as in the crocodiles, while in fact they

were observing the skull of a true crocodile, and not au alligator. The Gavial of

Senegal, of Adanson, is most like the Crocodihis cataphractus of Cuvier, which has a

long nose like a gavial, but is a crocodile : this animal has been redescribed under

various names. Dr. Gray stated that the crocodiles of India had been much mis-

understood                                             some authors said the common crocodile of Africa was found in India,
                                                    ;

others confused more than one species under the name of C. pahstris. There are four

--species found in India : two are confined to the estuaries or the mouths of rivers,

where the water is brackish, as Crocodilus poromis or biporcatus, which is found on

all parts of the coast and also in the islands of Java and Borneo, and even on the

north coast of Australia ; the other is a new species, confined, as far as we at present
know, to the coast of Pondicherry. The latter is only known, from a specimen

lately received (French), as Crocodilus biporcatus. The other two are confined to

the inland rivers ; and they are sometimes found high up in the mountains, where

the water of the river is frozen. It is to be observed that these river-crocodiles,

which have been confounded with the African kinds, are known from them by the

short, broad shape of the intermaxillary bone, which is separated from the maxilla

by a straight suture, while in the crocodiles of the African rivers the intermaxillary

bone is produced behind and between the edge of the maxilla. One species is

generally distributed over distant parts of India ; the other is confined to Siam,

and is probably the animal described by the French missionaries, though the speci-

men in the British Museum has no crest on the occiput; but the author believes
that this may be either an effect of age or an individual peculiarity.

On the Production of similar Medusoids by certain Hydroid Polypes belonging
                 to different Genera. By the Rev. T. 'Hincks, B.A.

   The author's object in this paper was to put on record the remarkable fact, which
had lately come under his observation, that the Tubularian polypes, Stauridia pro-
ducta (Wright) and Coryne eximia (Allman), produced lledusoids which at the time
of detachment ivere nndistingmshable from one another.
--108 REPORT 1862.

The genus Stauridia was nearly allied to Coryne, but was distinguished from it

by having tentacles dissimilar in character. Its upper tentacles were furnished with

globular tips, its lower were filiform and rigid ; in Coryne all the arms were capitate.

The S.producta was a small, creeping, unbranched form ; the C. eximia was branched,
Yand attained a considerable size.
                                    et of the life-series of these two Hydroids, thus

Adissimilar in general character, one term was identical.  strictly analogous fact

would be the production of flower-buds absolutely identical by two plants of dif-

ferent genera.

   Reference was also made to the close similarity, if not perfect agreement,
existing between the Medusoid of Coryne eximia and that of the C. Sarsii of Loven.

   The author then described the gonophores of the Stauridia producta, and the
development of its Medusoid, which was characterized as having a somewhat bell-

shaped umbrella, studded with thread-cells ; a rose-coloured manubrium, with a

simple mouth ; four radiating vessels ; four tentacles, which originated in as many

rose-coloured marginal tubercles, on one side of which was a dark reddish-brown

ocellus. The arms were very extensile, set with knot-like clusters of thread-cells, and
terminating in a spherical bulb. There were no marginal bodies except the tentacles.

   The author objected to the use of the term Medusoid to designate the free repro-

ductive body of the Hydroida, as tending to perpetuate a false conception of the
nature of the sexual zooid. It helped to keep up the idea of its distinct and absolute
individuality, and to conceal its real significance as the mere equivalent of the
flower-bud in the plant. In the life-series of the Hydroid the polype was the alimen-
tary zooid, and the sexual element or term might be conveniently and correctly

designated the gonozooid.

On a Species of Limopsis, noiv living in the British Seas ; with Remarks on the
                       Genus. By J. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.B.S.*

The author described the animal of Limopsis aurita (Brocchi), which he had

lately taken by dredgingoff the north coast of Shetland, and he gave an historical

account of the* genus. This discovery, in a recent state, of a shell previously known

only as a tertiary fossil, was adduced by Mr. Jeffreys in support of an opinion which

he had elsewhere expressed, that many species of Mollusca, which were supposed

to have become extinct, existed somewhere in the vast extent of the present sub-

Amarine area.  knowledge of the animal of Limopsis, and of the true position of
Athe genus, was among the desiderata of both conchologists and geologists.
                                                                            list

of the recent species, with particulars of their synonymy and habitat, was appended

to the paper.

      On a Specimen o/Astarte compressa having its Hinge-teeth reversed.
                             By J. Gwtn Jeffreys, F.R.S.

   The author exhibited a specimen of Astarte compressa, taken by Mr. Robert
Dawson in the Moray Frith, having only one primary tooth in the left valve, and
two primary teeth in the right valve, being the contrary of what usually occurs.
The muscular impressions were in their ordinary position. Mr. Jeffreys considered
this to be a case of partial or incomplete reversal, and that it was different from
the cases of reversed bivalves which had been noticed by Dr. Gray in the ' Geological
Journal ' for 1824 and ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1833. In those cases the

shell was inequivalve ; in Astarte it is equivalve.

Notice of some Objects of Natural History lately obtained from the Bottom of

                            the Atlantic. By Prof. W. King.

   Her Majesty's ship ' Porcupine ' has been engaged during a portion of the past
summer in taking deep-sea soundings on the west coast of Ireland, in connexion
with the proposed Atlantic-telegraph scheme ; and the author has been authorized
by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to draw up a report on the various
organic and inorganic objects obtained during the expedition.

                          * See Annals of Natural History, 3rd ser., vol. x. p. 343.
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                     109

On the present occasion he gave a brief summary of his examinations.

The greatest depth at which specimens have been obtained is 1750 fathoms.

The soundings from this and less depths, up to 1000 fathoms, consist almost

entirely of microscopic organisms, such as those made known by Bailey, Wallich,

and others, and procured by similar expeditions.

The marvellous profusion of Foraminifera and other minute structures in the

soimdings shows that there is forming at the bottom of the Atlantic, wherever it

descends below the level of a few hundred fathoms, a wide spread of calcareous

deposits, which will eventually become converted into beds of limestone. While

nearly all the particles of these deposits are the shells of dead Foraminifera and

their impalpable debris, it is evident that the surface of the Atlantic bed is one

vast sheet of the same organisms in a living state, whose office it is to clear the

waters of the ocean of the mineral and organic impurities which are ever flowing

into them.

Although perforating-shells are living at great depths, Prof. King does not

think there are any grounds for apprehending that they would bore into a telegraph

cable ; and he is inclined to believe that there is little chance of its getting injured
if laid down on foraminiferous bottoms, as in such places chemical and vital

actions appear to be going on so rapidly and unceasingly, that a cable cannot but

become covered up in the course of a few years with a considerable deposit of

calcareous matter.

   The expedition has been fortunate in bringing to light some interesting facts in

--microscopic life, in making known some species of shells and other animals new to
--the British fauna, and in extending our knowledge of the habitats of certain rare
Aspecies.
            fishing-bank which has been discovered, yielded to the dredge, at

100 fathoms, Leda pygmcca, Pisidium fulvum, Area raridentata, Limatida sub-

auriculata, Scissurella crispata, Crania norvegica, &c, besides Sponges, Starfishes,
and Sea Urchins. Of fishes, a species of Rhombus, allied to the Whiff, and a

species of Sebastes, allied to the Norwegian Haddock, were dredged on the shal-

lower parts of the bank. Specimens of a Pipe-fish were captured on the surface,

nearly 200 miles west of Galway : the fishes appear to be unrecorded as British

species. The same prolific bank yielded an abundance of a large Hermit Crab,

specimens of which were taken tenanting the rare shell, Buccinum ovum. At the

depth of 340 fathoms the lead brought up orbulo-globigerinous mud, containing

dead specimens of a Pecten, an Area, and a Pectuncidiis, all of which appear not

            Notes on Sphterularia Bombi. By John Lubbock, F.B.S.

   In the first number of the ' Natural History Review ' (January 1861), the author
has given an account of this curious entozoon, which was first described by Leon Du-
four, and very appropriately named by him Spha-rulariaBombi,the genericname being
taken from the "spherules " by which the body is covered, and the specific name
indicating the victims which are attacked. It has also been observed by Siebold,
who met with the young. At one end, in every single specimen, was attached a
small nematoid-like worm, closely resembling a young 8ph<erularia in form and
size, and which the author presumed to be the male. So small however was it, so
diminutive in comparison with its gigantic mate, that it had escaped the notice
both of Leon Dufour and of Von Siebold. It was always attached in the same
manner, namely, at a point near the tail, but distant from it by about one-fifth of
the whole length of the animal, and was affixed to the female body almost at one
extremity and at the end opposite to the opening of the female generative orifice.

   The internal organs of Sphcendaria were stated to consist only of a long, single
ovary and a double row of large cells, which were attached at the two ends, but,

with that exception, lay freely in the general cavity. No mouth or anus, no intes-

tinal canal, muscles, nerves, or vessels, were found in this curious and abnormal

entozoon,

  The author now confirms his previous statements. He has also examined a

number of Bees in winter, hoping to ascertain the mode of development. But
though he has met with specimens in which the female portion was so little de-
veloped as to be even smaller than the male, still in every case the organic whole
consisted already of these two parts.

   The youngest females contained a quantity of brownish granules, which extended
from one end of the body to the other. As the animal increased in size, these
granules remained stationary, and became more and more compact, so as to form

a sort of rod. When the ovary became distinguishable, it was found that this rod,

which in the meantime appeared to have undergone little alteration, occupied the
lower part or uterus, with its lower end close to the vidva. In the younger females
the eggs did not descend in the uterus as far as the "rod;" but in more mature
specimens the eggs as they made their way towards the vulva passed along the side
of it, without breaking it up or altering its position. If therefore, as seems pro-
bable, the "rod " is the seminal element, the impregnation of the eggs is thus sim-
ply and thoroughly secured.

   The author also gives some account of the development of the spherules and of

the large fat-cells.

   He expresses his regret that he has not yet been able to trace out the whole
development, but it has not been from any want of perseverance on his part. He
has examined in the winter months more than one hundred Humble Bees. The

young Sphcerularias, however, are very difficult to find, not only on account of their
minute size, but because in consistence, colour, and form they so closely resemble

the nerves, muscular fibres, and other organs among which they live. He hopes,
however, that future researches may be more successful.

         On two Aquatic Hymenoptera. By John Lubbock, F.li.S.

  On one of the early days in August, I was looking for larva? in some water from
a pond near my house in Kent, when I was astonished to see a small hymenopterous

insect, swimming in the water by means of its uiuys. This was a phenomenon so

mysurprising that at first I could hardly believe                                                      eyes. Of the very large number of

Hymenoptera already described, about 3500 occur in Great Britain yet not one
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

                                                                                      ;

not one is yet recorded as using its wings under water. Entomologists might

fairly, therefore, require good evidence before they receive as true a statement so

opposed to all previous experience. Not only, however, did further examination

disclose a second species, belonging to a different genus (which, however, used its

hind legs, and not its wings, in swimming), but I was fortunate enough to succeed

in exhibiting to the Entomological Society and also to the British Association living

specimens of this interesting little insect.

Moreover it is a very remarkable fact that it was again observed within a few

days, and yet quite independently, by another entomologist, Mr. Duchess of Stepney,

who found a single specimen. It is certainly a curious coincidence that, after

remaining so long unnoticed, it should be found by two separate observers within

a few days of the same time. Perhaps this may be, in part at least, accounted for
by supposing that during this season it has been more common than usual. I for-
warded some specimens to Mr. "Walker, who at first considered them to belong to

Polyrwma fuscipes, but on a more careful examination satisfied himself that they

belonged to a different and hitherto undescribed species, which I propose to name

P. nutans.

   Although it did not carry any external air-bubbles clown with it, still it was able
to remain alive under water for about twelve hours. The family to which it
belongs pass their early stages as parasites within other animals, and the perfect
insect probably enters the water in search of a suitable victim in or on which she
may lay her eggs. Nevertheless the essentially aquatic habits of the species are
proved by the fact that the male goes under water as readily as the female.

   "Without the assistance of figures, it would be useless to attempt any description

of the separate parts ; but I may remark that if this insect had been extinct,

however perfect its remains might have been, no entomologist would have
doubted that, like its congeners, it was entirely an aerial insect.

peduncle ferruginous.

   The second new species is more peculiar, and must form a new genus. It occurred
with the first, but was much rarer, only six specimens having been met with, all of
which were females. Perhaps the males are not aquatic in their habits. In this
case, however, it was the hind legs which were 1133d for swimming, although they
possessed no fringe or other apparent indication to adapt them to their new function.

On the Influence of Changes in the Conditions of Existence in Modifying
  Species and Varieties. By the Rev. "W. N. Molesvvoeth, M.A., Rochdale.

The author of this paper commenced by giving a brief sketch of the main features

of Darwin's theory of the origin of species, in order that its salient points might be

kept in view by the audience during the reading of the paper. He then proceeded

to point out that the theory thu3 outlined was not a mere wanton attack on beliefs

and feelings which every one was bound to respect, but was intended to supply a

scientific desideratum                                                                                                    and that, whether proved or disproved, it was calculated to
                                                                                                                       ;

advance our knowledge of the sciences to which it related. He wished it, however,

clearly to be understood that his approval was limited to the theory of the origin

of species, and not to the conjectures respecting the origin of organic life which

--are put forward at the close of the book conjectures which, he submitted, it was

impossible either to prove or disprove, or even to adduce any facts bearing on them,

and which therefore cannot lead to any scientific results.

After considering some objections which had been made against the Darwinian

theory, the author of the paper proceeded as follows :

And how is it that, with all their differences, they all possess so many characters

Howin common ?  is it that the line of demarcation which separates them is often

so faintly traced that we lose sight of it altogether ? These are the questions which

Mr. Darwin raises, and to which he has given an answer, which, whether true or

false, is certainly highly ingenious and original, and supported by a large array of

facts. Whether his theory is true or not is a matter on which I express no opinion

but that a necessity exists for a theory on the subject to which it relates is, I would

submit, a matter that admits of no doubt.

There is another of Agassiz's objections that seems to me better founded than

that with which I have just been dealing. He says, " The assertion of Darwin,

which has crept into the title of his work, is that favoured races are preserved,

while all his facts go to substantiate the assertion that favoured individuals have a

better chance in the struggle for life than others." In this passage Agassiz seems

to me to have pointed out the respect in which Darwin's theory is defective and

stands in need of further elaboration. I contend that he has not paid sufficient

attention to a very manifest and important principle, which has probably played as

large a part in the origination of species and varieties as either the struggle for

existence or natural selection. I mean the chanye which is continually going on

in the conditions of existence, and which, by affecting a great number of individuals

in the same manner, tend to produce similar modifications in all the beings who

are surrounded by them. In employing the term " conditions of existence," I mean

to imply the totality of the circumstances by which the organized being is sur-

rounded--the air, the climate, the soil, the vegetation, and the animals which inhabit

the same area, including those of its own species. All these are, if we look at the

matter rightly, conditions of its existence, inasmuch as all of them exercise a more

or less powerful influence on it, causing it to be other than it would be if they

were absent or different from what they are. The thing to which I desire to draw

particular attention is the change which is always going on in these conditions of

existence, owing to their mutual actions and reactions. For instance, the very

constitution of the atmosphere is to a certain extent altered by every organized

being, as well as by the inorganic matter with which it is continually entering into
Knew combinations.
                                                                                                                          any one shoidd suppose that the changes thus produced

must be quite inappreciable even though earned on through millions of generations,

let him reflect for a moment on the enormous quantity of former constituents of the
 112 REPORT 1862.

 atmospheric ocean which are now buried in the form of coal and other fossil remains,

 as well as that far greater mass of animal and vegetable excrement and of other
 organic matter which is mingled with the inorganic substance of the earth's crust,
 and is composed in a great measure of ingredients abstracted from the atmosphere.

     Look again at the changes produced in the conditions of the existence of each
 animal by all organized beings inhabiting the same area. Some devour it, others are
 devoured by it ; some become more scarce, others more plentiful ; some exercise a
 beneficial, others an injurious influence on it; but all are in some way changing its
 conditions of existence, and all are being in their turn changed, as Mr. Darwin has
 so ably pointed out, by the struggle for existence and the process of natural
 selection. Again, all of them extract from the soil, directly or indirectly, some of
 its nutritious constituents, and return them to it in different forms, in different

 places, and under different chemical combinations. Add to all these other causes
 of change the action of the being itself in altering its own conditions of existence,
 and it will at once be evident that, in the course of such long periods of time as we

 have referred to, striking and marked changes must be produced in the conditions

 of existence of almost every species.

   Hence it follows that if we suppose a group of beings to be at one period of their
history in harmony with the conditions of their existence, they must at all subse-
quent periods be more and more out of harmony with it ; and that, on the suppo-

sition of the invariability of the species, this discrepancy between the species and
its environment must at length become so great that its extinction must become
inevitable. It necessarily follows from this, that there must be on the part of the

species a constant instinctive, though perhaps unconscious, effort to restore the lost
equilibrium, to get rid of the sufferings which will arise from the want of it, and
to place itself once more in harmony with its conditions of existence ; and the

greater the change in the conditions, the more strenuous will this effort be. Some
one once remarked to Coleridge, " All things find their level." "No," replied that

great man, "all things are finding their level like water in a storm." This saying

appears to me to describe, with the happiness of genius, the nature of the incessant

movement that is always going on in all parts of the world, and amongst almost all
its animal and vegetable inhabitants. All are unconsciously striving to keep them-
selves in harmony with a medium which is continually changing.

   In order, then, that they may not be utterly distanced by the ever-changing con-

ditions of their existence so as in time to become extinct, they must possess a
capacity for variation in the direction of those changes which is absolutely illimit-
able, provided only that sufficient time be allowed for its development. That they
do possess such a capacity to a certain extent has been triumphantly demonstrated
by Darwin. The real question is, Are there any, and, if so, what, limits to this
capacity of variation in the direction of actual or possible changes in the conditions

of existence ? Now, in reference to this question, it seems to me that Mr. Darwin

has not sufficiently distinguished between a capacity for variation and a tendency
to vary, which, I would submit, are two very different things. I would respectfully
contend that the capacity for variation is in the being; but the tendency to
vary arises out of the changes which take place in the conditions of existence, and

in the efforts unconsciously made by the being to overtake those changes. When,

therefore, a species of animals inhabit the same area, they will, generally speaking,
be exposed to nearly the same changes in the conditions of their existence. This

will almost necessarily lead-to similar variations manifesting themselves in the
same individuals at the same time, because they will all be exposed to the same

changes, and variations thus produced are much more likely to be strengthened and

perpetuated than varieties arising from temporary causes, or such as affect indivi-

duals only. Mr. Darwin says, " When a variation is of the slightest use to a being,
we cannot tell how much of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural
selection, and how much to the conditions of life ;" and a little further on, " Such
considerations as these incline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of

the conditions of life. Indirectly, as already remarked, they seem to play an im-
portant part in affecting the reproductive system and in thus inducing variability

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and natural selection, will then accumulate all profitable variations, however slight,
until they become plainly developed and appreciable by us."
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  113

   Now in these passages, and in every other part of his work in which he touches
on the subject, Mr. Darwin appears to me to overlook, or at least not to make

 sufficient allowance for, the progressive changes which are always taking place in
 the conditions of existence of almost every living creatine, although his book teems
with proofs of it. But there is another oversight running through the work, and
strongly exhibited in the passages just cited. Mr. Darwin speaks of natural selec-
tion as accumulating profitable variations, whereas it is quite evident that, at utmost,
it can only repeat them. Natural selection acts, as Mr. Darwin shows, by preserving
the serviceable variations, and discarding the unserviceable or injurious; but as it
does not produce them, so neither of itself can it strengthen them : that, I maintain,
is done by the conditions of existence acting on the variability of the animals which

--are placed among them. Mr. Darwin elsewhere writes : " Seedlings from the same

fruit, and young from the same litter, sometimds considerably differ from each other,
though both the young and the parents, as Midler has remarked, have apparently

been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life ; and this shews how unimportant

the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of repro-
duction and of growth and of inheritance ; for had the conditions been direct, if
any of the young had varied, probably all would have varied in the same manner."
I deny this probability. If Mr. Darwin has certainly established anything, it is

this, that animals do possess a capacity for variation in almost every direction.

But it is equally certain that this capacity for variation differs very much in

different individuals, so that the same influences do not produce the same effects,

though they tend to do so. And therefore even if we assume (which I am not

prepared to admit) that the conditions of life are the same for seedlings of the same
fruit, and young of the same litter during the period of gestation, still it would not

follow that they were either absolutely or comparatively unimportant, or that the
variations which showed themselves were not due to them. In a word, I contend
that the capacity for variation is in the animal, but that it depends in a great

measure for its development on that assemblage of circumstances which we deno-

minate the conditions of its existence ; and the changes, which in the greater part
of animals are slowly taking place in those conditions, impress on the variations

a certain definite direction, while natural selection tends to the preservation of the

most favourable of the variations thus produced. At the same time I am by no

means prepared to deny the influence which Mr. Darwin attributes to the laws of
reproduction and growth : all I maintain is that he underrates the influence of
the conditions of life, and overlooks that of the changes which are slowly but con-
tinually taking place in them, at least for most organized beings ; and he farther
employs language which seems to imply that natural selection has something to do
with the production of favourable varieties, when all his arguments go to prove that
it tends only to the preservation of those which have been produced by other

--causes. I maintain therefore that two classes of inquiries ought simultaneously to

be carried on one into the variability of organized beings, and another into the

variations of the conditions of their existence.

    After illustrating these views at some length, the author of the paper concluded

as follows :

    This is not the place for entering on the theological aspects of the question.

Indeed, I am forbidden, I believe, by the rules of the Association to do so. So far

from regretting this prohibition, I cordially approve it, regarding it not merely as a
regulation of wise expediency, but as the embodiment of a sound principle. I
maintain that the intrusion of Scriptural arguments into scientific investigations is

as theologically erroneous as it is scientifically mischievous. Let us push our

investigations of the Creator's works as far as we can in every direction, without

the slightest fear that scientific truth can ever clash with moral and religious truth
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and let us apply to the theory before us what Galileo said of his when exposed to
objections similar in principle to those which had been urged against Mr. Darwin's,

On the Characters of tlie Aye-aye, as a test of the Lamarchian and Darwinian
  Hypothesis of the Transmutation and Origin of Species. By Professor K.

   Owen, M.I)., F.E.S., F.G.S.

The author, referring to the results of a recent dissection of the Chiromys mada-

yascariensis, Cuv., said, that most naturalists who had had the opportunity of

studying the living habits of the Aye-aye in its native climate, from Sonnerat to

Sandwith, had observed its faculty of detecting larvae boring in wood, of gnawing

down to their tunnels, and extracting them for food, for which this animal shows

a predilection ; they also describe the animal as sleeping during the heat and glare

of the tropical day, and moving about chiefly by night. Many particulars of the

structure of Chiromys closely accord with these alleged habits and natural diet.

The wide openings of the eyelids, the large cornea and expansile iris, the subglo-

bular lens and tapetuni, were, the author remarked, arrangements for admitting to the

retina and absorbing the utmost amount of the light which may pervade the forests

frequented by the Aye-aye at sunset, dawn, or moonlight. Thus the Aye-aye is
able to guide itself among the branches in quest of its hidden food. To discern
this, however, another sense had need to be developed to great perfection. The

large ears are directed to catch and concentrate, and the large acoustic nerve and its
ministering " flocculus " seem designed to appreciate any feeble vibration that might

reach the tympanum from the recess in the hard timber through which the wood-

boring larva may be tunnelling its way by repeated scoopings and scrapings of its

hard mandibles. ' The Aye-aye was a quadrumanous quadruped, in which the front

teeth, by their number, size, shape, implantation, and provision for perpetual renova-
tion of substance, are especially fitted to enable their possessor to gnaw down, with

gouge-like scoops, to the very spot where the ear indicates the grub to be at work.

The instincts of the insect, however, warn it to withdraw from the part of the

burrow that may be thus exposed. Had the Aye-aye possessed no other instru-

ment, were no other part of its frame specially modified to meet this exigency,
it must have proceeded to apply the incisive chisels in order to lay bare the whole

of the larval tunnel, to the extent at least which would leave no further room for
the retracted grub's retreat. Such labour would, however, bo too much for the

reproductive power of even its strong-built, wide-based, deep-planted, pulp-retain-

ing incisors ; in most instances we may well conceive such labour of exposure to be

disproportionate to the morsel so obtained. Another part of the frame of the Aye-

aye is, accordingly, modified in a singidar and, as it seems, anomalous way, to

Wemeet this exigency.  may suppose that the larva retracts its head so far from

the opening gnawed into its burrow as to be out of reach of the lips, teeth, or

tongue of the Aye-aye. One finger, however, the medius, on each hand of that

animal has been ordained to grow in length, but not in thickness, with the other
digits ; it remains slender as a probe, and is provided at the end with a tactile pad

and a hook-like claw. By the doubtless rapid insertion and delicate application of

this digit, the grub is felt, seized, and drawn out. For this delicate manoeuvre the
Aye-aye needs a free command of its upper or fore limbs ; and to give it that power,

one of 'the digits of the hind foot is so modified and directed that it can be applied,
thumb-wise, to the other toes, and the foot is made a prehensile hand. Hereby the

body is steadied by the firm grasp of these hinder hands during all the operations of
the 'head, jaws, teeth, and fore paws, required for the discovery and capture of the

common and favourite food of the nocturnal animal.

Thus we have not only obvious, direct, and perfect adaptations of particular

mechanical instruments to particular functions--of feet to grasp, of teeth to erode,

of a digit to feel and to extract,--but we discern a con-elation of these several

modifications with each other, and with modifications of the nervous system and

sense-organs--of eyes to catch the least glimmer of light, and of ears to detect the

feeblest grating of sound,--the whole determining a compound mechanism to the

perfect performance of a particular kind of work.

  But all this must have a cause ; and we are led to a conception of the nature of

--such cause by the analogy of its effect with that of the exercise of faculties that

energize in our own intellectual nature ours, too, the highest that we have direct

and material cognizance of in this sphere of life and labour-- in which, with such

faculties to foresee, invent, and adapt, we dimly conceive, in analogous but more

perfect results, the exercise of like faculties in a transcendentally higher degree.

To conceive the direct formation and adjustment of such an organization as that

of the Chiromys to its purpose accords best with the mode of our finite human

adaptive operations, but least with the sum of present observations bearing upon

the origin of species. Such observations have lea to the conception that the species

of organisms may be due to natural laws or secondary causes, operating to produce

them in orderly succession and progression* ; and also to the suggestion of tho
mode of operation of such secondary causes f.

   As a test of the value of some of these suggestions in making known or render-

ing intelligible the origin of a species, the organization of the Aye-aye lends

itself with peculiar force.

Buflbn, assuming that a certain number of species had been originally created

after a manner analogous to, and conceivable by, the way in which human machines

are made, conceived that there was a tendency 'in their offspring to degenerate from

the original type ; and he refers the Linnean species, about 200 in number, which

are described in his great work, to about fifteen primitive stocks. As, however,

the Aye-aye, had he known as much as is now known of it, might have been

referred to a " primitive type or stock," or to one of the " isolated forms " such as

Button conceived the Elephant and the Mole to be, the author proceeded to apply

the Aye-aye, as a test, to Lamarck's kvpothesis of the origin of species.

   The < Philosophic Zoologique ' teaches that species, like varieties, have their

origin, maturity, and departure, changing with the course of the changing operation

of the causes that produced them                                                                                                                    that such so-induced changes of form and
                                                                                                                                                 ;

structure lead to changes in powers and actions, and that such actions become

another cause of altered structure ; that the more frequent employment of certain

parts or organs leads to a proportional increase in the development of such parts

and that as the increased exercise of one part is usually accompanied by a corre-
sponding disuse of another part, this very disuse, by inducing a proportional degree
of atrophy, becomes another element in the progressive mutation of organic forms J.

   According to the modifying influences suggested by Lamarck, a Lemurine qua-

druped, attracted by the noise of a boring caterpillar in the bough on which it
happened to be perched, instinctively applied its incisors to the bark, and, by fre-
quent repetition of such efforts, increased the mass of the gnawing muscles, which,

stimulating tbe growth of the bone, led to concomitant modifications in the size
and proportion of the jaws. The incisors, by repeated pressure, either became

welded into a single pair above and below--or, the stimulus to excessive growth

being concentrated on one incisor, the neighbouring teeth became atrophied by
disuse, and by derivation of their nutrient fluid to the contiguous pulp ; hence the

preponderating size of the pair of front teeth, and the extent of edentulous space

behind them. Concomitantly with the efforts excited by the particular larvivorous

tendency of a certaiu Madagascar Lenrur to expose the canal in which its favourite

morsel lay hidden, were repeated endeavours to poke the longest finger into the
burrow so laid open. The repeated squeezing of the soft skin, with the compression
of the nerves and vessels, permanently affected the growth of such digit, and kept
it reduced to the blighted state, whereby it happens to be suited to the work of
extracting the larva. Lamarck supposes all these changes to be gradual, and
effected only through long succession of generations ; he assumes that changes of
structure, due to habitual efforts and actions, are transmissible to offspring ; and
he finally invokes, like his successors, the requisite lapse of time and long course
of generations. It is to be supposed that, until the modifications of dental and

digital structures were brought about, the grub-hunting Lemur subsisted on the
necessary proportion of fruits and other food more readily obtainable under the

ordinary Lemurine condition. That the same finger should be the seat of the

wasting influences on both hands and in all Aye-ayes strikes one as a result hardly

to be looked for on the hypothesis of the cause of such specific structures propounded

by Lamarck : that there should be a peculiar modification of the muscles of the

forearm, whereby hoth flexor sublimis nuijiexor profundus combine their action

upon the same tendon, pulling the probe-like digit, is left unaccounted for. The

physiologist finds still more difficulty in accepting the explanation of the way in

which the peculiar size, shape, and law of growth of the incisors could be brought

about. The action of muscles pressing upon the bony sockets might affect the

growth of teeth filling such sockets, but could not change a tooth of limited growth,

like the incisors of an ordinary Lemur, into a tooth of uninterrupted growth. Be-

sides, the crowns of both the scalpriform incisors of the Chiromys and the ordinary

small incisors of other Lemurines are formed according to their specific shape and

size, before they protrude from the gum : they acquire so much development while

the animal still derives its sustenance from the mother's milk. In the Aye-aye the

chisel or gouge is prepared prior to the action of the forces by which it is to be

worked. The great scalpriform front teeth thus appear to be structures fore-

--ordained to be predetermined characters of the grub-extracting Lemur ; and one

can as little conceive the development of these teeth to be the result of external

stimulus or effort, as the development of the tail, or as the atrophy of the digitus

medius of both hands. The author had elsewhere tested the Lamarckian hypothesis

of transmutation by the phenomena of the dentition of the male Gorilla, and no

refutation of his argument had appeared.

There remained then to be seen whether the subsequently propounded hypothesis

of " natural selection " would afford a better or more intelligible view of the origin

of the species called Chiromys madagascariensis. Applying to the Aye-aye the illus-

tration of his hypothesis, as submitted by Mr. Darwin to the Linnean Society *, it

may be admitted that the organization of a Lemur, feeding chiefly on fruits or

birds, but sometimes on grubs, is or might become slightly plastic, in the sense of

Webeing subject to slight congenital variations of structure.  may also suppose

changes to be in progress in the woods of Madagascar causing the number of birds

to decrease, and the number of insects to increase, especially of those the larvae of

which are xylophagous. The effect of this might be that the Lemur would bo

driven to try to catch more grubs. His organization being slightly plastic, those

individuals with the best hearing, the largest front incisors, and the slenderest

middle digit, let the difference be ever so small, would be to that extent favoured,

would tend to live longer, and to survive during that time of the year when birds

or fruits were scarcest ; they would also rear more young, which would tend to

inherit these slight peculiarities. Were the Lemurs to be reduced to this insect-food,

those individuals less plastic than the incipient Aye-aye, or not varying in the same
way, would become extinct. Acceptors of the hypothesis of " natural selection "

may entertain no more doubt that such causes in a thousand generations would

produce a marked effect upon the Lemurine dentition and limbs, adapting the form

and structure of the Quadrumane to the catching of wood-boring grubs instead of

birds, than that any domesticated quadruped can be improved by selection and

careful breeding. But, to the author of the present communication, the propound-

ing of such plastic possibilities left no sense of any knowledge worth holding as to

the origin of the species called Chiromys mndagaseariensis, no help to the conception

of such origin which was at all worth so wide a departure from actual experience of

facts. He knew of no changes in progress in the Island of Madagascar necessi-
tating a special quest of wood-boring lame by small quadrupeds of the Lemuiine

or Sciurine types of organization. Birds, fruits, and insects abounded there in the

ordinary proportions ; and the different forms of Lemuridce there coexisted, with

their several minor modifications, zoologically expressed by the generic terms

Liehanotus, Propithecus, CJiirogaleus, Lemur, and Chiromys.

On the Zoological Significance of the Cerebral and Pedial Characters of Man.
                   By Professor R. Owe*, M.D., F.B.S., F.G.S.

  Professor Owen, in illustration of the above characters, exhibited the casts of

the brain of a male European and Negro, and a cast of the interior of the cranial
cavity of a full-grown male Gorilla ; also figures of the hones of the feet of the

Man and male Gorilla, in plates from his " Memoir on the Osteology of the Gorilla "

(Trans. Zool. Soc. vol. v. pi. 11).

   The brain of the Gorilla, as exemplified by such cast, is of a narrow-ovate form,

with the small end forward ; the cerebrum does not extend beyond the cerebellum
viewed with the lower surface of the medulla oblongata horizontal, it does not
extend so far hack as the cerebellum does. The difference of size between it and a
small-sized Negro's brain was exemplified in the subjoined admeasurements:

In these admeasurements some deduction from the Gorilla's brain must be made

for the thickness of the dura mater and other membranes included in the cast :

that of the Negro's brain showed it stript of its membranes ; and the admeasure-
ments are from a subject corresponding with the smallest of those figured by Tiede-

mann in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1836, pi. 32, in which the posterior

cerebral lobes extend half an inch beyond the cerebellum.

Although in most cases the Negro's brain is less than that of the European,

Tiedemann and the author of the present paper had observed individuals of the

Negro race in whom    the  brain was as large as the average  one  of the  Caucasian
                                                                                                                     ;

and the author concurred with the great physiologist of Heidelberg in connecting

with such cerebral development the fact that there had been no province of intel-

lectual activity in which individuals of the pure Negro race had not distinguished

themselves. The contrast between the brains of the Negro and Gorilla, in regard

to size, was still greater in respect of the proportional size of the brain to the body

the weight of a full-grown male Gorilla being one-third more than that of an

average-sized Negro.

Passing from this contrast to a comparison of the Gorilla's brain with that of

oilier Quadrumana, the author insisted upon the importance and significance of the

much greater difference between the highest ape and lowest man, than existed

between any two genera of Quadrumana in this respect ; the brain of the Gorilla,

in the contraction of the anterior lobes, in the non-development of posterior lobes

extending beyond the cerebellum, and in the paucity, symmetry, and relative size

of the cerebral convolutions, so far as they were indicated in the cast, closely

accorded with the brain of the Chimpanzee. From these to the Lemurs the dif-

ference of cerebral development shown in any step of the descensive series was in-

significant compared with the great and abrupt rise in cerebral development met
with in comparing the brain of the Gorilla with that of the lowest of the human

races. This difference paralleled the difference in the structure of the lower limbs,

especially the foot, in the Gorilla and Man ; on which difference, as exemplified

in the Chimpanzee and lower apes and monkeys, Cuvier had founded the ordinal

grade to which he had assigned the genus Hcmo, under the term Bimana. The

disposition of the hallux as a hinder thumb, with the concomitant modifications

of the tarsal bones, was as strongly marked in the Gorilla as in any lower Quadru-

mane, and the contrast between the foot-structures of the Gorilla and Negro was as

great.

  The homologies of the parts in the structure of both brain and foot of the Human

and Simial Mammalia being demonstrated, as by Tiedemann* and Cuvierf, no

hypothesis of the cause of these homologies, with their structural gradations and
differences, would abrogate the necessity of the zoological disposition of the differ-
ent members of the animal kingdom in groups of different degrees of value. The

modification of the human foot having been, in the author's opinion, rightlv esti-

mated by Cuvier as of ordinal value, he contended that the equal or correlative

degree of difference shown in the development of the human brain, regard being

had to the higher importance of that organ in the animal frame, necessitated its

higher appreciation as a zoological character, and that the now known characters

of the Gorilla's brain confirmed the reference of the Bimanous order to the subclass

Areliencephcda.

    On the Homologies of the Bones of the Head of the Polypterus niloticus.

                   By Professor R. Owen, M.D., F.B.S., F.G.8.

   Preparations and sections of the skull of the Polypterus were exhibited, showing

the way and proportions in which the bones of the exo- and endo-skeleton were
blended together, more especially the extension of the epencephalic segment
backward freely beneath the overarching roof of dermal bones, from which the
super-, ex-, and par-oecipitals were distinct. Professor Owen referred to a para-
graph in his ' Lectures on Comparative Anatomy ' (vol. ii. p. 136), in reference to the

inconstancy of the dermo-cranial bones of the Sturgeon, and the confusion caused by
applying to them the names "super-occipital," "par-occipital," or other synonyms
of the vertebral elements of the skull. The same remark applies to Polypterus,

Lepidosteus, and many extinct Ganoidei.

On Zoological Provinces. By Sir J. Richardson, F.Ii.S.

This paper consisted mainly of a single question, " What is a zoological pro-
Avince ? '
            right and full answer woidd, in the author's opinion, open one avenue

to the solution of the origin of species which has occupied the naturalists of this

country for several years.

He referred to the Palmipede group of birds. The highest latitudes of the Arctic

regions to which man has penetrated are the native places of the Snow Goose, and

of various other members of the family, who, having reared their young in two brief

months, speed to the southward and winter on the verge of the tropics. Is this

whole space, little less in extent than a hemisphere, to be accounted a zoological

district ?

   The range of the Whale is not far short ; but land-animals have a much less
wide distribution. Has every class of the Vertebrata a different zoological pro-
vince ? and how far are any of them conterminous with the provinces marked out

by botanists ?

           On certain Modifications in the Structures of Diving Aninuds.
                          By Prof. Rolleston, M.D., F.R.8.

   In the class Mammalia, the Cetacea were contrasted with the Phocida?, and in
the class Aves, the Colymbidaa were contrasted with the Cinclidae, as to the
degree of modification which their tegumentary, circulatory, and osseous systems
had undergone in adaptation to their aquatic habits.

   The skin of the Seal was less specially modified than that of the Whale, and
the aberrations from the ordinary Mammalian character which its bones and teeth
presented were in like manner less marked than those of the animals with which
it was compared. The teeth in the order Seals were often irregular as regarded
their number, their implantation, and their permanence in the jaw; and the
epiphyses of the vertebrae were often slow to unite with the bodies. All these
particularities were instances of correlation of growth existing between the skin and

medullares proficiscuntur, inque fundo cornu posterioris plicas graciles et retroflexas for-

mant, in cerebro Simiaruin desunt ; nee in cerebro aliorum a me exuminatorum mamma-
Hum occurrunt ; Homini ergo proprii sunt." (lb. p. 51.) Both the above propositions

are susceptible of flat contradiction on homological grounds, and are, nevertheless, true as

zoological characters.

systems as far removed from its direct influence as the osseous and dental ; and

all these particularities, together with those of the systems with which they were

correlated, were much more marked in the Whales than in the Seals.

The Seals were well provided with intrahepatic venous sinuses, but their reser-

voirs for arterial blood were far inferior in grade of development to those of the

Cetacea. Little coidd be said as to difference in the degree of patency in the fora-

men ovale and ductus venosus in the two subjects of comparison, at least so far as
the Common Seal (Phoca ritulind) and Common Porpess (Phoccena communis)

might serve as representatives of the two orders. To the rudiments of the foetal

vena umbilicalis and ductus Botalli, in both, the same remark applied.

The stunted salivary glands of the Seals seemed an approximation to the con-

dition of total absence which we find in carnivorous Cetacea ; and, but that some

of the latter class possessed olfactory bulbs, a similar relation might be said to

prevail between these organs also in the two orders.

In both classes alike, the weight of the brain was high as compared with that

of the body : in a young Phoca vitulina Dr. Rolleston had found it to be as 1 : 46
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            j

in a young I'hoccena communis, as 1 : 60.

The bark of the Seal spoke plainly enough to its want of any such arrangement

of the larynx as the Whales possess ; but a recent inspection of a large Seal (Pela-

i/ius monachus) had shown it to possess an exceedingly strong sphincter mu3cle

guarding the entrance to the respiratory passages, and it might be conjectured that

the membrano-muscular pouch in connexion with the nasal passages in the Stem-

matopus cristatus was a foreshadowing of the sac so often described in connexion

with the Cetacean blow-hole.

Several fcetal structures were permanently retained in the Cetacea. The thymus,

as shown by Mr. Turner (Edin. Phil. Trans, xxii. pt. 2), was one of these ; certain
other remnants of the general formative mass of blastema which surrounds

the aorta in the foetus, noticed by himself in the ' Natural History Review ' for
Oct. 1861, furnished a second example ; and to these the author would now add a
third, in the largest remnant of a Wolffian body, or organ of Giraldes, which he

had met with in the class Mammalia. The author proceeded to say that, in the

two classes of birds which ho had to contrast, scarcely any such approximations

coidd be traced between the two sets of structures to be compared.

   The modifications in the tibia}' of the birds commonly known as " divers "

(Colymbinte), and the large intrahepatic venous sinuses which they, in common with

the mammals just spoken of, possessed, were beautiful adaptations to the special

habits of these animals ; but nothing at all reminding us of these structures wovdd be

found in such a bird as the Water-Ouzel (Ci?iclus aquaticus). Indeed, the soft

parts of this bird presented very few points of difference from those of a Redwing

 Turdus Mucus)  dissected at the  same time with  it, except    in the much  greater

(

development of the second pectoral muscle. The large size of this muscle was per-

manently recorded on the keel of the Ouzel's sternum ; and this point might

perhaps have enabled us, a priori, to predict that the bird possessed the peculiar

habits which have given it its trivial name. This ridge extends the whole length

of the keel in the Water-Ouzel ; and in this point, as well as in the lesser relative

depth of that process, and in the greater relative breadth of the lateral portions of

the sternum, and in its more nearly circumscribed posterior emarginations, the bird

in question differed from allied species of dissimilar habits.

   The author communicated the results derived from the simultaneous exposure of
various kinds of infusions prepared by him in Hull, Paris, and Liverpool. Amongst

these results the following afford fresh evidence against the theory of spontaneous
generation, and tend to prove the existence of innumerable germs of life in the at-
mosphere.

of Infusoria in his infusions, which he also discovered in the moistened dust from

his window ; and another well-marked species, found in large numbers by Dr. Bal-

d;,st from the high road near Liverpool, then'in dust taken from his own window
and washed in distilled water, and lastly even in pure, boiled, distilled water, after
it had been exposed a few days in the open air in Liverpool. The author watched
and carefully described the development of this species (Cercomonas acuminata)
from its first appearance to its full growth.

            On the Function of the Auricular Appendix of the Heart.

                          By Isaac Ashe, A.B., M.B.

 The  author  considered  that  the  well-marked  contrivance  exhibited  in  the  appen-

_

dix, such as the presence of carneas columnae in this portion only of the auricle,

indicated that it subserved some function more important than that usually assigned

to it, namely the better mixing up of the blood received from the veins. Three

ascertained facts, none of them ot much apparent value separately, would, when

connected together, give a hint as to what that function might be.
   The first was that the auricle, though having walls much thinner and weaker

than those of the ventricle, was yet able powerfully to distend the latter.

The second fact was that the auricle, unlike the ventricle, did not completely

empty itself of blood.

The third fact was that the auricular appendix, though placed at a distance from

the auriculo-ventricular orifice, yet was the last portion of the auricle to contract.

   From these three facts, taken together, Dr. Ashe inferred that the function of the

appendix was to effect the complete distension of the ventricle, notwithstanding the

powerful resistance of its thick muscular walls when distended nearly to their
utmost. The force of the appendix would be transmitted to the ventricle by means

of the small column of fluid still remaining in the auricle, and this force would be

multiplied within the ventricle as many 'times as the superficies of the fluid within

that chamber exceeded the surface which would be presented by the superficies of the

fluid within the appendix. Agaiust the walls of the auricular sinus this force would

be a minimum, in consequence of the small superficies of the fluid still remaining

within it.

 _ To a certain extent the same thing would be effected by the contraction of the
sinus alone, for its force would become multiplied within the ventricle in measure

as the superficies of the fluid in the latter increased in proportion to that in the

former, which diminished pari passu ; but the force exerted by the sinus becomes

diminished towards the close of its contraction, just when the maximum effort is

required, and would even vanish altogether were it not for the small column of fluid

remaining in the auricle. Dr. Ashe regarded the function of the carneae columnaa

as being neither to increase nor to diminish the strength of the appendix, for either
object could be attained with smooth walls yet both views had been put forward

-- --but as being to eflect the complete emptying of the appendix, since the force of

this organ could not be exerted on the ventricle except by the injection of a con-

siderable quantity of fluid within it. For this contrivance Dr. Ashe suggested the

name of "the hydrodynamic apparatus of the heart."

Dr. Ashe also considered that this powerful distension of the walls of the ven-

tricles might be an operating cause of their contraction, analogous to the view

which had been suggested regarding the cause of the contraction of the walls of the

uterus at the completion of the period of pregnancy.

                  On the Function of the Oblique Muscles of the Eye.
                              By Isaac Ashe, A.B., M.B.

   The author doubted the view that assigned to these muscles the function of

rotating the eyeball on its antero-posterior axis, never having observed such rota-

tion either incidentally or in experiment. The vision might be directed to any
object by the action of the recti alone.

   The view had been put forward that such rotation was necessaiy in order that
                                                                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                    121

corresponding1 points of the two retinas might continue on the same level
when the head was inclined to either side. Dr. Ashe considered that this effect

could only he produced with reference to a single pair of points in the retinae at
any one moment, and that only at the expense of an increased alteration in the
level of every other pair of corresponding poiuts. But he considered the attain-
ment of this object unnecessary, inasmuch as any corresponding pair of points
changed their level only with reference to the level of the earth's surface, and not
with reference to the point looked at ; this point, therefore, with the two on the
retinaB, would remain in the same relative position notwithstanding the rotation of
the plane containing them. Hence Dr. Ashe considered that the function of these

muscles was yet to be assigned ; while, on the other hand, a lmown function existed,

capable of being voluntarily discharged, for the exercise of which no voluntary

muscle had been assigned, namely, the adj ustment of the focal distance of the eye.

It had been considered that the ciliary muscle effected this by compressing the

globe. No doubt the action of the ciliary muscle might cause short-sightedness,

and this defect had recently been remedied by its division ; but the ciliary muscle

consisted of unstriped fibres, and its action must therefore be involuntary, which

was also demonstrated by the fact that the power of voluntary adjustment of the focal

distance was not destroyed by its division. Dr. Ashe considered that the position

of the obliqui was such that, acting together, and not separately as generally sup-

posed, they would compress the globe of the eye, as the ciliary muscle might do

involuntarily, and thus increase its refractive power by augmenting the antero-
Aposterior axis.
                                                                      diminution of focal distance would hence result. The retina

would be thrown backwards by the same action, and its power of receiving a dis-

tinct image from a near object enhanced considerably thereby. The elasticity of

the sclerotic coat would increase the focal distance again on the cessation of the

voluntary action of these muscles. This view was confirmed by the fact that a
person was conscious of a voluntary effort in adjusting the sight to an object placed
very near the eye, much more so than he would be to any effort in looking at a
distant object. It had been supposed that the four recti muscles, acting together,

might compress the globe and cause a shortening of the focal distance ; Dr. Ashe con-
sidered that the only effect of such a cooperation would be to draw the eyeball

back into the orbit, and, if anything, rather diminish the antero-posterior diameter

of the globe                                                          certainly they could not  increase it unless they  had  osseous  attach-
                                                                   ;

ments anteriorly as well as posteriorly. But it had been demonstrated that the

muscular fibres of the obliqui were continuous quite round the eyeball ; and hence
if they were to act together, as Dr. Ashe suggested, their effect would undoubtedly

be to increase the antero-posterior diameter of the globe. To correspond with such

a diminishing of the focal distance a slight approximation of the antero-posterior

axes of the eyeballs would be necessary, and were this to be accomplished by the
same mechanism the requisite correlation would be established between the two

actions. This would be effected by the muscles in question if the point where their

actions balanced each other were placed a very little anterior to that circumference

of the eyeball which should pass through their fixed. attachments, and this Dr. Ashe

considered was exactly the position of their insertion into the sclerotic.

  On voluntarily shortening the focal distance the pupil might be observed to con-
tract, relaxing again when the focal distance was elongated ; this seemed to cor-

roborate Dr. Ashe's views, since the inferior obliquns and the circular fibres of the
iris were both supplied by the third nerve, and might be simultaneously affected by

its action.

   In experimenting on the dead body, Dr. Ashe had found that, by the sense of

touch, a distinct elongation of the antero-posterior axis of the eyeball could be
recognized on drawing at once on the two obliqui ; he had found the sense of touch

the most delicate indication of the alteration.

                    On the Scientific Cultivation of Salmon Fisheries.

                          By Thomas Ashavoeth, of Cheadle.

   The main objects of this paper were to show the great value of salmon-fisheries,
how they have been neglected in England, and how they might be improved. The

produce of the English fisheries has fallen so low, that it has heen estimated not
to exceed 10,000/. per annum, and this including- the fisheries of Wales, while

the money value of the Irish, according to the reports of the Commissioners of

Fisheries, is not less than 300,000/. yearly; one fishery in Scotland, that of the

Duke of Richmond in the Spey, is said to return to his Grace 12,000/. annually. The
author, in illustration of what may be accomplished for the improvement of salmon
rivers, describes what has been done at his fishery in Galway, and the residts. In

the short space of ten years the river has been rendered ten times more productive.
During the present season as many as 3000 salmon have been taken with the rod.
This great improvement has been chiefly owing to the great care taken in pre-

serving the streams during the breeding-season, at an expenditure of 500/., and by

introducing young salmon, artificially bred, into streams fitted for them, but from

which the fish had before been excluded owing to impediments preventing access
from the sea. These impediments have either been removed or avoided by means

Aof ladders so constructed as to render the passage to and from the sea easy.

striking example is given by him of a river in Ireland converted into an excellent
salmon river by means of ladders. This river is in county Sligo, the property of
Mr. Edward Cooper. The ladders are over a fall of about 40 feet. So productive

^has this river, before ban-en, become, that in July last as many as 1000 salmon were

captured in one week.

An Attempt to show that even/ living Structure consists of Matter which is the

   Seat of Vital Actions, ami Matter in ivhich Physical and Chemical Changes

   alone talce place. By Professor Beale, F.JR.S.

   The object of the author was to show that every living structure was composed

--of matter that was "living" and matter that had ceased to "live " of "germinal

matter" and "formed material." The first was alone the seat of purely vital

phenomena, while in the formed material physical and chemical changes alone

occurred. It was not possible to form any notion of the chemical relation of the

elements of living matter. Neither coidd we obtain evidence as to the chemical
Wecharacter of the compounds of which living matter was composed.
                                                                   coidd not

mobtain living matter solution, and separate it again, as we could crystalline sub-

stances. The instant we commenced its chemical examination the particles ceased

to be living, and the moment they ceased to live the elements combined to form

certain compounds. The compounds did not exist as such in the living matter, but

were formed the moment death took place. To understand these views, it is neces-

sary to be acquainted with Dr. Beale's definition of the structure of a "cell."

At the last Meeting of the British Association, in Manchester, the author had

endeavoured to prove that every "cell," or "elementary" part of a tissue, con-

sisted of matter in two states---forming, growing, active, within ; and externally of

matter which had been in the first state, but was now formed, and had ceased to be

active. The latter could be changed by external conditions, Sec, but it had lost all

inherent active powers of changing itself, or of communicating its powers to inani-

mate matter. All pabulum (nutrient matter) which was to nourish a living-

organism must come into contact with the living or germinal matter. Then, and not

till then, it acquires the same properties ; so that the living matter has increased in

quantity in consequence of the inanimate pabulum, or certain of its elements, being

converted into this living matter. Such a change never occurred in inanimate matter

unless living matter were present. The greater the facility with which the inanimate

pabulum came into contact with the living matter, the faster this increased. No

matter how abundant the pabulum might be, if the living matter were surrounded

by a thick layer of formed material, the living matter would increase but slowly.

  It may be next inquired, What takes place during life in the smallest living inde-

pendent particle, which consists of an envelope offormed lifeless matter, with living

germinal matter within ?

1. Pabulum passes through the formed material, enters the living particles, and

reaching their centre, some of its constituents become living. Thus the quantity

of the living matter is increased.

   2. The new particles tend to move outwards from the centre where they became
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                         123

living, preceded by others which became living before them, and succeeded by new
ones. Thus, during the life of a spherical particle, new centres are continually

appearing in pre-existing centres.

   3. The oldest particles on the circumference of the spherule, having passed
through various stages of existence in moving outwards from the centre, gradually

lose the power of animating lifeless particles, and become resolved into formed
material, which is destitute of the power of increasing itself, and is no longer

living.

   4. The new-formed material is being produced upon the inner surface of that

--already formed that is, in contact with the germinal matter ; so that, passing from

within outwards, we have (a) germinal matter; (b) imperfectly developed formed
material; (c) fully developed formed material. The germinal matter exhibits in
cases a central portion (nucleus), within which may be one or more portions with
many circular outline (nucleoli), and within these smaller particles are often to be
made out (riucleoluU). Passing from within outwards are several zones, the inner-

most being most intensely coloured by carmine.
   The thickness of the formed material must gradually increase unless the oldest

part which is outside is removed as fast as new-formed material is produced ; in

the latter case we should have (d) disintegrating formed material.
    The conversion of inanimate matter into living matter, and the conversion of

living matter into formed material, are continually taking place during life. The
formed material, having been produced, is passive. It may be changed or altered,
but it has no inherent powers of compelling the elements of matter to assume cer-

tain fixed relations to each other, like the germinal matter. It has ceased to live.
   All the work performed by an organism during its life depends upon the action

of certain agents upon this formed material. All these changes are physical and
chemical, and can be caused to continue after the organism is dead ; but the formed
material itself can never be produced artificially, because its composition and pro-
perties depend upon the particles of germinal matter from which it was produced,
and these derived their powers from pre-existing living particles, and these from

their predecessors, and so on, back to the first living particle of that particular

Wekind which was created.  can cause the destructive changes to continue after

death ; but the constructive changes cease with life, and cannot be imitated arti-

ficially.

   The movements of living particles from centres, and the continual formation of

--new centres within pre-existing centres the power of inducing similar changes
--in particles otherwise incapable of undergoing change the progressive modifica-

tions taking place in a definite order, which end at last in the formation of passive

substances having properties and chemical composition totally different from those

of the pabulum on the one hand, and those of the living particles themselves on

--the other, constitute a series of phenomena which occur in every different kind

of living matter, and in living matter alone. They cannot be explained in the
present state of knowledge by physical and chemical actions, and they may still

be fairly termed vital phenomena, in contradistinction to those purely physical and

chemical changes which occur in the formed material.

Living matter always possesses the power of increase and formation, and these

processes of increase of the living matter, and its conversion into formed material,
take place respectively under different circumstances. The conditions favourable

to the increase of the living matter are not favourable to the production of formed

material. Living matter may inerease very rapidly, but the production of formed

material is comparatively a slow process. All those tissues which in their perfect
state are composed of much formed material in proportion to the germinal matter,
grow slowly. During the earlier periods of their existence their growth was

more rapid.

  When a mass of germinal matter becomes surrounded with a thick layer of

formed material, change, as would be supposed, goes on veiy slowly. The pabulum

passes slowly through the formed material, and in small quantity, so that very
little germinal matter is produced. The conversion of germinal matter into formed

material, however, still proceeds until only a very small quantity remains living,
surrounded on all sides by a thick, passive, and perhaps nearly impermeable en-

velope. But suppose this envelope be ruptured, or softened, so that nutrient
matter obtains more ready access to the living matter within, what happens?

The germinal or living matter rapidly increases, and may even grow at tlie expense

 of the softened envelope itself. Masses of living matter are formed in great
number, divide and subdivide, and perhaps multiply enormously, forming a soft

mass, which may continue to increase for a time, but is incapable of lasting.
The conditions favourable for the regular conversion of the outer particles of each
mass into formed material are not present, and the whole mass may die and
undergo disintegration and removal. Very many changes occurring in tissues in
disease may be explained by these views. The power of living matter to grow

infinitely is restricted by the conditions under which it is placed. Normally,

growth may be slow ; but if the restrictions be to some extent removed, then an
abnormal freedom of growth may directly occur. This is exactly what happens
in the process of inflammation. The germinal matter of the normal cells is more

freely supplied with nutrient matter, and this often depends upon actual rupture
of the envelope of formed material. These views, it will be observed, explain the
phenomena of nutrition, growth, secretion, &c, without supposing any peculiar
attractive power in the cell-wall, or any mysterious agency in its structure or in

the nucleus ; indeed, the existence of the cell, as it is generally defined, is dis-

pensed with altogether. The author's " cell " is a mass of living matter surrounded
by matter which had ceased to live, and which, like other inanimate matter, may
be changed by physical and chemical agents. lie reduces "the action of the cell"
to the motion of living particles from centres where they become living, their
passing through definite stages of existence, and their being ultimately resolved
into substances exhibiting special properties, but lifeless. So he would explain t lie
phenomena of inflammation, without resorting to the hypothesis of irritation, ex-
aggerated action from external stimulation, &c.

   According to the author's view, the most wonderful changes occur at the moment
when the pabulum reaches the living centre, where its properties become com-
pletely changed, and where it commences its new course of existence. To account
for the new powers which the particles have acquired, the author is compelled to
assume the existence of a special force or power which can only be derived from

particles which already possessed this power. He assumes that this power compels
the elements of the pabulum to take up new and forced relations to each other,

while, as they gradually cease to be under its influence, the elements resume their

--ordinary attractions, and special compounds are formed the nature of the com-

pound depending, therefore, upon the relations which the elements were constrained
to take up during the living state. Hence he maintains that vital power exists in
the particles of living or germinal matter, while tbe formed matter around this is
destitute of vital power, and is only influenced by physical and chemical forces

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and he thinks that while matter is in the state of living or germinal matter, it is in
a temporary condition which is distinct and peculiar, and cannot be compared with

any other state in which matter is known to exist. It is very remarkable that
matter in this temporary condition exhibits the same appearance in all living beings,
and possesses constantly an acid reaction. "When set free, a mass always assumes
a spherical form, and the smallest particles to be seen are still spherical. No one
could distinguish by microscopical examination the "germinal matter" of one

tissue from that of another, nor the germinal matter of one of the lowest, simplest

organisms from that of man. And yet, although the germinal matter of all struc-

tures appears to be the same, it differs most wonderfully in power as seen in tbe

results of its life. The formed material, on the other hand, exhibits, as we nil

know, differences of structure easily demonstrated, and differences of property
familiar to every one ; these differences being due to vital powers existing in the
matter when in its previous state of germinal matter.

deavoured to prove that the red fluid of the Earthworm is a receptacle for oxygen,
and is thus subservient to the aeration or respiration of the animal.

Some Observations on theVitality of Fishes, as tested by Increase of Temperature.

                           By John Davy, M.D., F.B.S., <ye.

   The experiments described by the author were made on eleven different species
of fish of our lakes and rivers, of which the several kinds of Salmonida? were of the
number. The results were that a temperature of water between 80 degrees and 100
degrees was fatal to each kind. The Sahnonidse were those which were most readily
affected by elevation of temperature, the other species bearing it according to their
kind somewhat better. The results generally were pointed oat as of some interest

in relation to the habitats of different kinds of fish, and also as tending to prove that
the accounts given by travellers of fishes existing in hot springs are exaggerated,
and not founded on accurate observation.

On the Question whether the Oxide of Arsenic, taken in very minute quantities
 for a long period, is Injurious to Man. By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S., 4'c.

   In this paper the author gave an account of a small mountain stream in Cum-

berland, Whitbeck by name, which contains a minute quantity of arsenic, and which
has from time immemorial been used by the inhabitants of an adjoining village,

without any marked effect, either bad or good, on man and other animals, with the
exception of ducks, to which birds the feeding in it has proved fatal. The author

attributed the innocuity of the stream to two circumstances : first, the extremely
minute quantity of arsenic present ; and, secondly, the little tendency that arsenic

--has to accumulate in the organs of animals the duck probably having less elimi-

nating power than others. He mentioned instances in which arsenic in equally

small quantity, derived from rivers in the Lake District, had proved fatal to the

charr. He presumed that arsenic exists in many other streams, the water of which

is used with impunity, the arsenic being derived from arsenical pyrites, a very

common mineral, by the action of air and water, and, as in the instance of Whit-

--beck, comparatively harmless, and this owing to two circumstances the very

slight solubility of the oxide in cold water, and the fact of the harmlessness of the
oxide in infinitesimal quantities.

   Some Observations on the Coagulation of the Blood in relation to its Cause.

                           By John Davy, M.D., F.B.S., 6,-c.

   These observations were chiefly made to test the hypothesis brought forward by

Dr. Richardson, that the coagulation of the blood mainly depends on the escape of

ammonia. The many results described by the author were opposed to this view.

First, he showed that blood in its healthiest state contains no appreciable quantity
of the volatile alkali ; and, secondly, that ammonia added to the blood in a notable
quantity did not arrest the change. Other experiments were described of a con-

firmatory kind.

   The conclusion finally arrived at was that we are still ignorant of the cause of the

phenomenon, and that the hypothesis of Dr. Richardson, if acted on in medical
practice, must be attended with risk.

Remarks on the Loss of Muscular Power arising from the ordinary Foot-

   clothing now worn, and on the Means required to obviate this Loss. By

    James Dowie.

    In wearing rigid-soled boots or shoes, the waste of muscidar power is of a three-
 fold kind : first, that arising from atrophy, in which the locomotive function of the
 muscles of the extremities is reduced below its normal standard; second, that
 arising from the extra force exerted in bending comparatively rigid clothing; and

third, that arising from the normal functions of the muscles of the feet when walk-

 ing being partially or wholly transferred to those of the pelvic region or upper
--126 repoet 1862.

parts of the body. In each case the sacrifice sustained is shown to be manifest.
The remedy proposed to obviate this threefold loss is the ingrafting of elasticated
leather into the sole of the boot or shoe, between the heel and tread, under the
instep, whereby the foot is allowed to perform with comparative freedom its natu-
ral movements in progression, and consequently the muscles to retain their normal
health, strength, and usefulness. The soundness of this conclusion is confirmed
by upwards of twenty-five years' experience in the wear of foot-clothing thus

--made. The elastic principle is shown to be a sine qua mom, niere form, however

adapted to the foot when in repose, being inadequate to obviate the loss of mus-
cular power when walking. In illustration of the elastic principle, two strong
Blucher boots were exhibited, the one made on Mr. Bowie's plan, having elasti-

cated leather ingrafted into the sole, in contrast with the other, a rigid-soled

" sealed-pattern regulation boot " as now worn by the British army.

        On Pearls ; their Parasitic Oriijin. By Robert Garner, F.L.S.

  --The author said he had particularly examined those formed in the mantle of the

Conway and Lancashire mussel, not the beautiful pearls of the Ahmnodon, from
the Upper Conway at Llanrwst, but those of the salt-water mussel : however, he
attributes the same origin to all pearls, the oxidation of a minute species of Distoma
causing their formation, much iu the same way that galls are formed in plants.

   On an Albino Variety of Crab ; with some Observations on Crustaceans,

             and on the Effect of Light. By Robert Garner, F.L.S.

   In four species of Crustacea which were observed, a splitting of the fore-claws at

lh<' third joint from the extremity took place during moulting, exactly as described
by Reaumur, the line of splitting being afterwards with difficulty perceived in the

--cast shell. This splitting always takes place in the same line a' line noticeable in

the shell of a crustacean not about to moidt, at least in those species observed, as

the Hermit-lobster. The author has rarely failed to detect the Nereis bilineata at

the posterior part of the spire of the shell which is occupied by the latter animal,

and many years back forwarded it to Dr. Johnston, of Berwick,' to whom it proved
an acquisition, and who believed it to be absent or rare on the Northumberland

coast. The little living Cancer pagunts exhibited was found in the root of a Fucus,
and when fresh moulted, which had happened several times during the last year,
was white except the ends of the claws. With respect to the action of light, the
author observed that some Actinias did not dislike it, whilst to others it was ex-
tremely distasteful ; for instance, Act. dianthua to avoid it frees itself from its at-
tachment and swims away like a Limnaeus with its base to the surface, whilst the
common Actinia seems to like it. As an example of the effect of obscurity on a
vegetable, the author showed a curious specimen of the Clavaria form of Potyporus
sqnamosiis, which sprung from a piece of oak in an obscure part of an iron-forge.
The Nereis above-mentioned seems sensible both to light and sound. The Crus-
tacea in which the valve-like split (if split it can be called) was observed, were
(besides the Hermit-lobster) the common and the shore crab, and the hairy Por-

cellana.

The Skull-sutures in connexion with the Superficies of the Brain.

                      By Robert Garner, F.L.S.

If the mammalian skull may be considered as formed by the enormous develop-

ment of the dements of several vertebrae, and if the vertebral medulla in fishes

gives indications of its being composed of separate ganglia, then analogy would

lead us to look in the brain for separate ganglia corresponding to as many vertebrae

as form the skull, and also to expect corresponding dispositions in other respects

--as regards nerves and their exit, the ventricles, and the form and distribution of the

internal grey matter all probably to be traced.

 However, we now confine  ourselves  to those  parts peculiar  to  the  brains of  the

_

higher animals--the convolutions. These are not merely chance forms due to the

errant meandering of arteries and veins ; for though organs are built up by arteries,

they are formed upon a preceding plan. The gyri or convolutions have a known
disposition, corresponding more or less on each side in all brains, so that it is possible

   That portion of the skull occupied by the cerebrum proper may be divided into

five surfaces--an ethmoidal, lodging the olfactory lobes, small in man, but ample in
other mammalia, as the marsupial or elephant ; a sphenoidal, to which the grey

matter about the optic commissure and the island of Reil correspond ; a frontal

for the anterior lobes of the brain, temporal surfaces for its inferior tuberosities ; a

parietal for the vastly predominant superior middle portion ; and an interparietal,

corresponding to the posterior lobes.

   Wishing to see exactly what gyri or sulci correspond to the sutures which divide
the regions of the skull, and finding that this cannot by ordinary comparison be
well done (our present modes of examination giving us anything but clear ideas of

the topography of the encephalon), the author devised a plan of piercing the skull
along the sutures, and marking the corresponding points of the brain by vermilion

introduced by means of a grooved needle. He then extracts the brain, and lets it

fall into a strong solution of corrosive sublimate, which has the effect of rapidly

hardening it so that it will allow of a perfect cast being taken from it. The mem-
branes may also be easily removed, though with more difficulty over the posterior

lobes. Pins are introduced into the brain at the spots where the vermilion punc-
tures are seen previous to taking the moidd, which should be formed of two appli-
cations of the liquid plaster, the first most fluid and of little bulk.

   With respect to the coronal suture, which appears to trend backwards in the

greatest degree in the lower races of man, it will be found to correspond to a certain
describable line. This begins before the first convolution above the commencement
of the fissure of Sylvius, and rises, not along the oblique fissure of Rolando (sepa-

rating the first from the second of those three remarkable oblique convolutions
arising from the upper lip of the Sylvian fissure, and going upwards and backwards
to the vertex), but more directly upwards, and more in front, before the anastomoses
which the anterior oblique convolution has with the frontal ones. These frontal
convolutions evidently run in a longitudinal direction in the adult, but more
evidently so in the foetal brain, well marking the frontal portion. Within the
longitudinal fissure the separation of the frontal and parietal portions is commonly
well marked in man, monkeys, and the lower mammalia.

   The squamous suture corresponds to the fissure of Sylvius, which, as far as the
external surface of the brain is concerned, may be said to commence about the
summit of the great ala of the sphenoidal bone, which in some skulls (prognathous

ones) does not always reach to the parietal bone.

  A suture occasionally exists in the occipital bone, marking the posterior edge of

the brain, apparently common in the American races, but not peculiar to them, as
was seen from photographs of a Negrito and other skulls, illustrating the paper in

this and other points relating to the skull, and kindly lent by Dr. J. Barnard Davis.
This interparietal bone (the cerebral portion of the occipital) appears to be worthy
of study ; it is large in the inferior races of man, and also full in the female. The
lambdoidal suture corresponds to the line which divides the convolutions forming

--the third lobe from the middle or parietal a line commonly well marked on the

brain surface, though not an uninterrupted sulcus ; more strongly in the Quadru-
maua, but still more strongly internally in the longitudinal fissure. The inferior
tuberosity of the brain is most intimately connected with the posterior lobe.

   The parietal portion of the upper surface of the brain constitutes, of course, by far
its largest region. Before, are some gyri already mentioned as being anastomoses
of the anterior oblique parietal convolution with the frontal. These anastomoses,
in combination with the inner frontal convolution, form in man a broadly halberd-

shaped figure, the coronal suture crossing at a little distance before the handle as it

were, but in many mammalia a broader trilobed figure like a club of cards or a fleur-
de-lis. Behind, we have already described three more or less well-marked convolu-

tions going from the fissure of Sylvius upwards and backwards to the middle line.
 128 report--1862.

 The middle one is always the most remarkable, and a fixed point for measurement
 its termination in the longitudinal fissure is marked by a deep sulcus, forming the
 anterior boundary of a quadrangular surface, of which the posterior boundary is the
 sulcus already mentioned as marking the division of the posterior from the middle
 lobes of the brain. The oblique convolutions (with or without the anterior one,
 and with or without some anastomosing gyri going backwards from the middle to
 the posterior lobe) form a remarkable broadly triangular or rather bat-shaped figure,
 more remarkable still in the Quadrumana, and reminding us of the bat-like expansion
 of the sphenoidal bone below, and its corresponding cerebral surface. This, of course,
is merely an accidental resemblance ; but where we are not sufficiently advanced to
make physiological divisions, such comparisons may be of use in studying " a mighty
maze, but not without a plan," and fairly belong to topographical anatomy
serving, like language, to embody our observations, and eventually, conjoined with
the comparison of the internal structure, or more definitely the course of the di-

vergent prolongations of the medulla oblongata through the brain, leading to large

 results.

             On the Physiological Effects of the Bromide of Ammonium.
                      By Geokge D. Gibb, M.D., M.A., F.G.8.

    After dwelling generally upon bromine and its salts, the author referred to the
alleged properties of the bromide of potassium. This salt he had used, and it failed

-- --to produce what had been asserted of its'powers. He had, however, changed the

base to ammonium the bromide of ammonium carefully prepared in a pure form
by Messrs. Fincham, of Baker Street, London; and on submitting a number of

healthy persons to its use, a series of highly important results were obtained. These
were detailed at some length, and the experiments described. The latter were not
yet complete, but the author thought them still sufficiently important to bring before
the Association.

    The great tegumentary systems, both internal and external,were chiefly influenced
by this agent, especially the former. The adipose structures came next under their
influence. Its effects on the skin justified its being considered a cleanser and beau-
tifier of the complexion. It restored secretion to the mucous membrane, and ac-
cording to the mode of its administration and the susceptibilities of the individual,
so did it produce anaesthesia, especially noticeable in the fauces and throat. The
membrane of the nose, the pharynx, the larynx, and bronchi, as well as that of the
eyes and ears, were subject to its influence; and in the course of his experiments,
the author foimd that the entire tract of the genito-urinary and gastro-pulmonary
mucous membrane was occasionally, not always, brought under the control of this
agent. It also exerted a peculiar and specific effect upon atheroma and fat ; and if
administered sufficiently long, and in proper quantities, it will slowly remove cor-
pulency and allied states through the blood. Fatty changes in certain organs, such
as the heart and its vessels, are arrested by it ; and the author believes it would
equal, if not surpass, the Fucus vesiculosus in some of its alleged virtues.

   The author intended to continue his investigations.

  On the Normal Position of the Epiglottis as determined hi/ the Laryngoscope.

                      By Geokge D. Gibb, M.D., M.A., F.G.S.

   After some remarks upon the various hypotheses which have been brought for-
ward by physiologists on the mechanism of the voice, which the author considered
Somewhat conjectural from the absence of ocular proof, he referred to the intro-
duction of the laryngoscope as likely to determine the true nature of phonation and
other phenomena connected with the larynx. Whilst not unmindful of this him-
self, he had devoted some attention to the inspection and study of the parts above
the glottis, especially to explain anomalous sensations there experienced. For this
purpose he had examined the throats of healthy persons with the laryngoscope, so

as to become familiar -with the parts in them. Up to the date of his communi-

cation he had examined 300 individuals, and his results were confined mostly to
the condition and position of the epiglottis, which were so important that they
had led him to form certain conclusions.

The author referred to the commonly accepted views in relation to the normal

position of the epiglottis being considered wholly vertical or erect, and quoted

Harrison, Knox, Bishop, Dunglison, Meckel, Cloquet, and even Czermak, in support

thereof.   Whilst                            admitting their                                                                                    correctness  to  a  certain  extent  in  the largest  portion

          _

of mankind, he has discovered, in the course of his physiological investigations with

the laryngoscope, that in eleven per cent, the epiglottis is not erect, but either

oblique or nearly transverse, and that this condition is not necessarily associated

with disease, occurs at all ages, and is occasionally congenital, being observed in

parent and offspring. The ages of those examined varied from 6 to 90 years.

The_ effect of this position of the epiglottis is an alteration in phonation, and

much inconvenience and danger in the event of disease, as well as inducing a pre-

disposition to take on diseased action. Speaking and singing are much affected
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        j

the 300 persons examined were then described.

The author summed up with the following conclusions :

1. Physiologically speaking, the epiglottis is vertical in the great majority of

mankind                                      in a certain proportion it is oblique                                                                               or nearly transverse.
                                          ;

2. The evils likely to arise from the latter at present appear to be so inconvenient,

that it wotdd be desirable that an inspection of the epiglottis should be made in

every child, where practicable, between the ages of 6 and 10 years, for the purpose

of ascertaining its correct position.

   3. If it is found to be not vertical, a knowledge of the fact will prove beneficial
through life in guarding against evils likely to arise, during the prevalence of epi-
demic sore-throat, or other diseases likely to involve the larvnx.

  4. No interference with the throat or larynx shoidd ever'be permitted without

the aid of laryngoscopic inspection.

   5.  Whilst any imperfection in the voice or speech may be explained by the posi-

_

tion of the epiglottis, independently of the vocal chords, a chance for the improve-

ment of both is held out, by adopting some means that shall render this valve

more oblique in direction than transverse, or possibly (but at present very doubtful)

restore it to a vertical position.

On Secret Poisoning. By George Habley, M.D., Professor of Medical

                    Jurisprudence in University College, London.

The author stated that although he had no wish to engender groundless suspicions

or excite unnecessary alarms, yet he was sorry to say he could not but repeat the

--statement he made last year in a paper on slow poisoning read before the Royal

Medico-Chirurgical Society of London namely, that he believed the cases of

secret poisoning that are discovered form but a small percentage of those that

actually occur. Nay, more, lie even went a step further, and declared that he not

only believed that we magnified the difficulty of perpetrating the crime, but that

we were also inclined to exaggerate the facility of its detection. No doubt, modern

discoveries in physiology and chemistry had enabled us not only to distinguish

between the effects of poison and natural disease during life, but likewise to detect

and extract the poison from the tissues after death. But modern discoveries had

also made known to us_ many poisons with which we were hitherto unacquainted.

It was in toxicology as in naval warfare, no sooner was a projectile discovered that

is considered irresistible than our engineers set about discovering armour-plates

more invulnerable than their predecessors. So, no sooner does the criminal find a

new poison that he can use with impunity, than the experts set about discovering

a means for its detection. He remarked that the great desire of the poisoner wa3

to get hold of a poison the effect of which would so closely resemble that of natural

disease as to be mistaken for it. Fortunately, however, this was attended with

extreme difficulty, as the effects of poison were generally sudden in their onset

and rapid in their termination                                                                                                                  for the poisoner seldom had time         or opportunity of
                                                                                                                                             ;

administering the poisonous agent in so small a quantity and for such a length of

time as are requisite to produce an artificial state of disease which may be mistaken,

at least by the unaccomplished physician, for real disease. It had been asserted that

in all cases of poisoning where death occurred, the poison ought to be found in the

tissues after death. He, however, pointed out that this was not strictly true ; for
even in the case of arsenic, which was supposed to he the most persistent of all
poisons, if the patient only lived long enough, the mineral might he entirely elimi-
nated by the excretions before death, and afterwards not a trace remain to be de-
tected in the body. Such occurred in Alexander's case, when, although it was
known that arsenic was the poison which caused death, none was found in the
body. Alexander, however, did not die till the sixteenth day. For this and other
reasons the author then said, " that as the not finding poison in the system after-
death is no absolute proof that the patient did not die from its effects, the symptoms
observed durin°- life, in conjunction with the morbid appearances observed after
death, even when no poison is discovered by chemical analysis, ought to be suffi-
cient to convict the poisoner ; and even the symptoms alone, if there be good cir-
cumstantial evidence, especially if combined with proof of a motive, ought to con-
vict, just as was done at Palmer's trial." The author concluded by_ saying that in
all cases of suspected murder, great care should be taken to avoid telling the persons
around the patient of the suspicion. The patient himself should be the first confidant
for if there was no motive for suicide, be was the most likely to be aware of a
motive in the persons surrounding him. The next confidant should be the doctor,
who, by obtaining some of the secretions and having them carefully analysed by a
competent person, would soon be enabled to decide if it was a case of secret murder,

and perhaps also give a clue to the detection of the criminal.

            Suggestions towards a Physiological Classification of Animals.

                                     By James Hinton.

   It is scarcely necessary to remark that no system of animal classification has yet
been accepted as entirely satisfactory, or that it is universally allowed that no

linear series can possibly fulfil the requirements of the case. As bearing upon this
subject, the author's attention has been drawn to the relation in which the Artieu-

lata and Mollusca stand to each other. It is manifestly impossible to place either
group, as a whole, below the other ; but there exists a marked jihysiological differ-
ence between them. In the Articulata, for instance, the organs of animal life pre-
ponderate, and give a decided character to the group, while in the Mollusca the
organs of vegetative life are not less strikingly predominant. The two classes
might well stand as representatives of the two great elements in which animal life
consists. With this thought in mind, it appeared to the author that the whole
animal series arranged itself (with certain difficulties and doubtful points of course,
but still on the whole very readily) in conformity with this idea. Thus, for in-

stance, between reptiles and birds a similar relation obtains.

    The author further illustrated his views by reference to other classes.

           On Simple Syncope as a Coincident in Chloroform Accidents.

                         By Charles Ktdd, M.D., M.B.C.S.

At two former Meetings of this Association, several reasons, chiefly obtained

from the large field of clinical experience of London hospitals and their operating-

theatres, were stated, and given in detail, why we should regard deaths from

chloroform administration as pure accidents ; and deaths in hospital, as not to be

considered exactly similar to deaths from overdoses in lower animals. The author

is desirous at pres'ent to state, that the leading facts and reasonings then expressed

have since been borne out by further, experiments and explained, but that at that

time part of the subject was purposely left incomplete.

   There is reason to believe that a large percentage of so-called chloroform deaths

arise from simple fainting-fits, or "shock" (as known long before chloroform
was discovered at all), but that note chloroform gets the discredit of them. The

deaths from sulphuric ether used as an anaesthetic (at least twenty-five in number)

were nearly all the result (most probably) of secondaiy haemorrhage after operations,

which  it  very much  favours,  as  also  a  state  of  deep  narcotism like                                            that  from
                                                                                                                     _

after chloroform post hoc, but not propter hoc ; tliey are very alarming, more so than
the asphyxia cases, as it is very difficult to rouse up the reflex and cardiac nerves
where syncope occurs, and, curiously enough, it seems to occur by emotion or fright

 irrespective almost of the chloroform.

    The author, being a believer in the value of the deductive philosophy of Mr. Mill
and Mr. Buckle in inquiries, like the present, of a physiological kind, wishes at
present simply to state that he finds the immense mass of facts as to chloroform
(chiefly experiments on the lower animals instituted by the Biological Society of

Paris, as detailed in the very masterly essay of MM. Lallemand, Perin, and Duroy

a mass of facts of the highest importance, only very recently published) entirely
agree with and corroborate the clinical views he had the opportimity of laying

before this Association.

    It is a pleasure to be able to state, that every year's additional study of chloro-
form in London leads to a feeling of greater and greater satisfaction as to its value
and safety ; that this impression also agrees with clinical experience in other cities

of Europe, and even in America, where chloroform has now nearly superseded the

use of ether.

   The author wished the present paper to be short, to be, in fact, complementary of
former communications. The aggregate number of deaths from chloroform is very

alarming ; but there is reason to think that, in nearly all the cases, the points here

discussed previously, as to the necessity of good respiration, good pulse, &c, still hold
good for all cases. It seems very desirable that the results, however, of the hospital
experience of the members of the Physiological Section of this Association could be

obtained as to any new facts or observations that may have come under notice ; for

the entire subj ect of anaesthetics is, as yet, but in a tentative or rudimentary con-

dition.

   The physiological data of former discussions were left unsettled and incomplete,
as said already, in order that a more full consideration might be given to the exact

value of simple syncope as a source of danger.

   The discussion hitherto, in Dr. Snow's time, as to the nature of death from chlo-
roform, with the consequent precautions to be observed to ensure its safety in
practice, had been almost entirely confined to an examination of one question
whether these accidents arise from what the late Dr. Snow named " cardiac syn-
cope," with engorged state of the right side of the heart, or from simple syncope,

the right side not engorged.

   The more philosophical mode of regarding the subject now is to look on both

causes as active : the " cardiac syncope '' is a post-mortem result, however, as it is
described by Snow, and is in reality death from apnoea or asphyxia, and arises in
some manner, most probably from some error in the administration of the chloro-
form ; but the second cause of death, or simple syncope, is due to idiosyncrasy. This

advance in our knowledge is of importance as to saving life in these cases : we were
before looking, like the knights of old, at only one side of the shield, but now we
know the shield has two sides.

   Having previously described at Oxford the mode in which accidents, by asphyxia

or " cardiac syncope," occur through irritation of the laryngeal recurrent nerve, or

other more recently described nerves, distributed to the mucous membrane of the
larynx and air-passages (" Rosenthal's nerves"), it is only necessary to state that
further experience helps to corroborate this view. This form of death by asphyxia
or apnoea arises by stoppage of action of the respiratory muscles and diaphragm, and
can also be brought about in experiments on the lower animals by any even me-

chanical irritation of these laryngeal nerves ; hence the grave necessity of care, in the
early stages of the chloroform administration, not to excite or irritate the larynx by
acid or impure chloroform, which, like some gases, at once induces spasm of the
glottis, with subsequent signs of asphyxia. This was fully entered into at the Oxford

Meeting.
   Indeed, so sensitive is the larynx, and so peculiar its tolerance of chloroform, that

this fact of the irritation of its mucous membrane by a strange vapour is now taken
advantage of, and where we have to fear simple syncope or faintness, as in for-

midable operations like ovariotomy, and where syncope is impending in the middle
of such operation, the addition of a drachm or two of ether to the inhaler, or a few

                                                                                                        9*
132 report--1862.

drops of ammonia, seldom fails to rouse the most flagging pulse (as easily con-

ceivable) through these very nerves. Explain it how we will, the clinical fact is

of the utmost importance.

 --This is shown in another direction in this manner : if we render an animal deeply

narcotic by chloroform, in fact all but dead, and then allow it to come back slowly to

its usual condition, there is one point where, if the laryngeal nerves be pinched
with a forceps, it causes sudden spasm of the glottis, the diaphragm stops acting,

and, for want of breathing, the animal falls back again into a state of narcotism or

asphyxia, and may die.
   With this recent discovery as to these nerves we may perhaps couple the group

of facts that there is greatly increased danger attached to surgical operations about
the larynx or neck (as observed in practice), arising from cutting or injury of its

nerves, or catching them up in forceps whilst tying arteries, &c, some intimately

associated with nerves of the cardiac plexus, others with the larynx itself, &c.

    If the act of breathing freely continues during the administration of chloroform,

we may be almost certain all is right, and the pulse good ; but if the breathing
becomes slow or intermittent, stopping and going on again, we are not so safe. Some

patients, it is true, seem to take the chloroform slower than others, but it is a fatal
error to push it on ; the chloroform will accumulate in the system, and the after-
effects will be tedious, if the surgeon, for want of time or other causes, hastens the

administration.

Is death from chloroform, so called, sometimes a coincidence ?

It is well to remember that very marked syncope, and even death from syncope,

may occur without the use of chloroform at all : intense sudden pain may cause

death and syncope; injury of a tendon, or a largo bleeding, or even such a trifling

thing as touching the urethra in sounding for stone (as remarked especially by

Heurtaloup ),  may induce  most  alarming  syncope                                  great weakness  from  want  of
                                                                                 ;

food, as in soldiers sometimes after a battle, will also give a great tendency to syn-

cope : so that it is always of advantage to learu more or less of a patient's history

when we are about to administer chloroform.

Accidents from syncope and chloroform may occur from apprehension of pain,

rather than actual shock, or actual pain, or deep chloroform narcotism ; hence so

many accidents in the early part of the administration, before the patient is uncon-

scious at all. Thus of 125 deaths carefully analysed, fifty-four occurred immediately

all fatal accidents in the operating-theatre, a certain large percentage of which are

obviously the effect of purely mental causes or fear.

   Persons with strangulated hernia, about to be operated on, are known to have

died before any incision at all (without chloroform), the patients taking the shaving
of the pubis for part of the operation. Bichat saw a patient die on the instant of
passing a simple seton. Dr. Watson tells of a patient dying suddenly at the sight
of a trochar about to be used in tapping the chest. Desaidt was one day about to
perform the operation for stone ; the patient did not present anything unusual in
his manner, and was placed in the usual position : Desault traced simply a line with
his thumb-nail on the perineum ; the patient uttered a shriek, and fell stone-dead.

--Mr. Stanley used to tell of a similar case Chopart was about to operate for circum-

cision on a lad, when the boy fell dead the instant the knife touched him. Garen-
got had a patient with a thecal abscess, who had a shudder and sudden death on

seeing the tendon move.

   Syncope thus becomes a complication, in modern surgical operations, of much

greater seriousness than before. That death occurs not from over-narcotism is at

once evident, as it arises from apprehension of pain, the patient being quite conscious

when these syncope accidents have, occurred.
   These deaths (and they amount to about thirty in the hundred of all the deaths)

are observed to happen while the patient is having the chloroform administered,
before the surgical operation (at sight of knives, saws, surgeons' aprons, a crowd of

students, dressers, strangers, &c, in the operating-theatre), showing how much wiser

it is to have the patient placed under chloroform in the sick-ward, than to be exposed

to this mental shock. In some London hospitals it is so, in others the point is not

next to apnoea or asphyxia, already minutely dwelt upon, this mere coincidence of
simple syncope is most to be dreaded

  Observations made at Sea on the Motion of the Vessel with reference to Sea-

                              SicJcness. By J. "W. Osborne.

    The author stated that he had entered upon this investigation during a voyage
 from Melbourne, not with the interest of a physician, whose object it woidd be to

 cure this distressing malady, but rather for the purpose of establishing the nature

of the connexion between mechanical movement of the human body, both active
and passive, with the phenomena of nutrition and waste, functions which mani-
fested many interesting and remarkable anomalies during an attack of sea-sickness.

   Many observations of a pathological and physiological character had been made

 and recorded ; but it soon became apparent that to obtain results of real value, the
nature, force, and direction of the movements to which the vessel subjected the
body, and its several organs, required investigation. To express these mechanical
 influences, three instruments were contrived and used with satisfactory results.

 These instruments were exhibited by the author, and the following is a sketch of

the description given to the Section.

    The first consists of a spring balance, capable of suspension from any part of the

ship. By placing a known weight in the pan of this instrument, the deflection in-
dicated by the index would be constant under ordinary circumstances on shore. At

sea this was not the case, the pan being there subjected to an unceasing oscillatory
movement, while the index indicated at one time more, and at another less than
the figure on the scale corresponding to the weight used.

    The range thus obtained depended chiefly upon the severity of the pitching ; and

if the divisions of the scale represented fractions of the weight used, the alteration

in weight of any of the viscera of the human bodj, with every wave, might be
arrived at in fractions of their own weight ; such alteration being, of course, ap-

parent only, but acting, nevertheless, upon all supporting ligaments, muscles, &c.

exactly as if it were real.

   It was well known that the pitching motion of a vessel was very potent to pro-
duce illness, and in the instrument exhibited, the means were offered for measuring
and expressing exactly the intensity of this motion ; but it was necessary while re-
cording these readings, to determine what the angular movement the vessel made
amounted to. To effect this a divided arc was made use of, which, while its man-

ner of suspension permitted of its accommodating itself to one of the angular
motions of the ship, partook for the time being of the other. Opposite to this arc,
and from the centre of the circle of which it was a part, a plummet or pendulum,
made of a strip of metal, was freely suspended. The part played by the latter was
to establish a point from which to read off the number of degrees through which
either axis of the vessel passed in pitching or rolling. But as the inertia of the
pendulum caused it to be seriously affected by the impulsive movements to which
the vessel was subjected in passing through the water, it became necessary to neu-
tralize these irregularities. This was accomplished by placing in rigid connexion
with the pendulum a small disk, which travelled through a curved tubular recep-
tacle containing oil, glycerine, or other viscid fluid, which, while it did not inter-
fere with the obedience of the plummet to the action of gravity, effectually pre-
vented the communicated impulses from manifesting themselves in the readings.

   The third instrument was designed to estimate the force of the impulsive move-
ment above referred to, and was an arrangement of a somewhat complicated cha-
racter, in which the oscillations of a pendulum, unaffected by the angular movements
of the vessel, were read and recorded. These oscillations originate in consequence
of the inertia or momentum of the pendulum itself, freely suspended in a ship vary-

ing in its rate of motion through the water.

   Several extended series of observations had been made with these instruments
which were not as yet reduced.

             On Tobacco in relation to Physiology. By T. Reynolds.

    The author commenced his paper by adverting to the value of saliva, which he
averred was intended for the purposes of digestion, and ought not to be unneces-
sarily wasted, which was the case with a vast number of habitual smokers. The
purity of the saliva ought to be preserved, which could not be the case if it were

tainted with smoke. He pointed to the fact that the people of Israel, as we read

in Holy Writ, were not an enfeebled race, because they did not infringe natural

laws. The paper proceeded to quote the names of various medical men who were

opposed to the practice of smoking ; some avowing that tobacco-smoke, being con-
veyed into the stomach, injured the brain. One doctor had seen leeches fall dead

when sucking blood from the veins of a man who smoked, the blood of the smoker
being much more impure than that of the non-smoker. Dr. Copland avowed that

smoking arrested the growth of the young. Dr. Seymour, in writing to the Earl
of Shaftesbury, stated that smoking was a remote cause of insanity, and produced

premature constitutional decay ; in fact, smoking was attended with many unfor-

tunate tendencies.

On the Study of the Circulation of the Blood. By George Robinson, M.D.,

    Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London, 6fc, Newcastle-on-Tyne.

   The writer commenced by observing that Harvey having established the general
law of the circulation of the blood, and expressed an opinion that all the secondary
functions depended on it, left to posterity the task of investigating its mode of
action in inducing the other phenomena of life. But while every succeeding gene-

ration has furnished fresh proof of the importance of this discovery, comparatively
little has been done towards elucidating the manner in which the motion of the
blood acts in the production of its numerous and diversified effects, although the
actions directly dependent on it are not only physiologically interesting, but also
play an important part in the production and removal of disease.

  Among the causes which have interfered with the proper development of Harvey's

views, the writer notices the undue prevalence of a metaphysical physiology, and
a consequent disregard of the legitimate application of the principles of physical

science to the explanation of the actions of the living body. He contends that this

preference of the ideal to the real still operates to some extent in the same manner
as when Harvey's hydraulic reasoning shocked the prejudices of his contemporaries,
and that the doubts still occasionally expressed as to the sufficiency of the heart as
the prime mover of the mass of blood, the assumed existence of undemonstrable
adjuvant forces, and the affectation of incredulity as to the applicability of the laws
of hydraulics to the solution of the physiological questions directly connected with

the blood's motion, all evidence the injurious effects of the continued neglect of
natural philosophy as a branch of medical education, and the retarding influence
on medical science of such inattention to the physical agencies operating in the
performance of the vital functions. In further confirmation of this opinion, he

alludes to the fact that certain views as to the mechanism of vascidar absorption
and effusion, which he published many years since as the result of an attempt to
explain on hydrodynamic principles some of the uses of the circulation, have

neither been received nor refuted by the systematic writers on physiology, who are

still satisfied with old doctrines on these subjects, applicable only to stagnant liquids,

and quite incapable of accounting for some of the phenomena in question. He

then asks on what other principle of research than that adopted by Harvey him-
self can we ever hope to understand the action of the currents of blood in accom-
plishing their various uses ; and refers to the evident subservience of the structural
arrangements and physico-vital peculiarities of the organs of sight, hearing, respi-
ration, speech, motion, &c, to the physical principles involved in each particular

function, as a proof of the operation of the general laws of matter in the living
body, and of the consequent applicability of hydrodynamic reasoning to the expla-

nation of many of the uses served in the animal economy by the innumerable streams

of blood incessantly permeating the tissues.
    In the application of these principles, it is essential to observe closely the physical
                                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      135

and vital properties of the living structures, and to combine, if possible, the know-

ledge and labours of natural philosophers and physiologists. He therefore concluded

by submitting to the Council of the British Association the propriety of appointing
a subcommittee to cooperate with the Royal College of Physicians of London
(who are specially interested in everything relating to Harvey's fame), for the pur-
pose of investigating the physics of the circulation, and so rendering more intel-
ligible the nature of the connexion existing in the living body between the motion
of the blood and the performance of the secondary functions of life.

On the Difference of Behaviour exhibited by Inuline and ordinary Starch when
   treated with Salivary Diastase and other converting Agents. By Professor

    Rolleston, M.D., M.A., F.B.S.

    The following were the chief results to which Prof. Rolleston had arrived :
    I. Inuline from the Dahlia retains sugar with great tenacity, but, by repeated

            washings, it can be freed from that impurity.

  II. When thus freed from sugar, it obstinately resists the converting influence of

               salivary diastase.

HI. This salivary diastase was obtained from human saliva, and from parotid- and

            submaxillary-gland substance infused with water and buccal mucus.
FV. The same salivary diastase instantly converted ordinary starch into grape-sugar.

 V. This salivary-gland infusion, however, if made with salivary-gland substance
           from young animals yet sucking, Dr. Rolleston had found to be ineffectual
           upon ordinary starch. Bidder's researches were in accordance with his.

 --These results led to the two following practical rides : 1. Artichokes are little

likely to act as a substitute for the potato, as they contain inuline vice starch.
2. Starch-foods are useless in the early months of infancy, as salivary diastase at
such a period is inactive.

Tobacco-Smoking : its effects upon Pulsation. By Edward Smith, M.D., F.B.S.,

Assistant-Physician to the Hospital for Consumption, Sfc, Brompton.

   Dr. Smith had recently made a series of observations, chiefly upon medical men,
which showed that in some persons tobacco-smoking greatly and rapidly increased

the rate of pulsation.

   The experiments were made at 10 p.m., when the rate of pulsation naturally
declines (as he had proved by hourly experiments published in his work on the

Cyclical Changes of the Human System), and at least four hours after any fluid or

solid food had been taken. They were made in the sitting posture, after it had been

maintained fifteen minutes, and with the most absolute quietude of body and mind
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and thus all influences were eliminated but those due to the tobacco.

   The rate of the pulsation was taken every minute for a period beginning two or
three minutes before the smoking began, and continuing during twenty minutes,
or until the pipe was exhausted.

   The following are the chief results obtained :

 --Experiment 1. Pulsation before smoking was 74§ per minute.

  =Smoking 6 minutes, 79, 77, 80, 78, 78, 77 per minute 78-1 average.

   Smoking 7 minutes, 83, 87, 88, 94, 98, 102, 102 per minute=93-4 average.

  =Smoking 8 minutes, 105, 105, 104, 105, 105, 107, 107, 110 per min. 106 average.

   After smoking 11 minutes, 112, 108, 107, 101, 101, 100, 100, 100, 100, 98, and 91.

  There was thus a maximum increase of 37f pulsations per minute.

Experiment 2. Smoking through camphor julep in a hookah.

Pulsation before smoking 79J per minute.

Smoking 6 minutes, 81, 81, 81, 83, 82, 82 per minute =81 -6 average.

The maximum increase was 17J pulsations per minute.

Experiment 3.-- Smoking an empty pipe.

Pulsation before smoking 78 pulsations per minute.
--136 keport 1862.

   Smoking 11 minutes, 76, 78, 77, 76, 79, 79, 80, 80, 79, 78, and 79.
   There was no increase in the rate of pulsations from the effort of smoking or from
its interference with the respiration.

   Experiment 4. To ascertain if after smoking 6 minutes, during which the effect is
very small, and then ceasing smoking, any increase in the effect would follow.

    Pulsation before smoking- 75 pulsations per minute.

 --Smoking 6 minutes, 76, 75, 79, 79, 76, 78.

   Smoking 1 minute, 82. Cease smoking.

    Smoking- 10 minutes, 81, 88, 83, 82, 84, 83, 83, 80, 82.

   The rate of pulsations was maintained, but was not materially increased.

Experiment 5. To prove if the rapidity of smoking causes a variation in increase

ofpulscdion.

              a. Greater volume of smoke.

Pulsation before smoking 70| per minute.
Smoking 6 minutes, 68, 70, 71, 70, 72, 74=70-8 average.
Smoking minutes, 76, 77, 86, 89, 91, 94=85-5 average.
Smoking 4 minutes, 98, 95, 96, 95=96-0 average.

The maximum effect was thus 27^ pulsations per minute.

                                              b. Smoking faster.
   Pulsation of the last minute in the previous part of this experiment, viz. 95 per

--minute. Smoking 3 minutes, 94, 94, 96.

                                       c. The pipe recharged.

   Smoking 5 minutes, 87, 93, 96, 96, 96.
   There was therefore a large effect upon the pulsation, but probably not more
than would have occurred with ordinary smoking.
   Numerous other experiments were made with tobaccos of different reputed
strengths and upon' different persons, and the author gave minute directions as to
the proper method of making such inquiries.

                GEOGEAPHY AND ETHNOLOGY.

                 On the Civilization of Japan. By Sir 11. Alcock.

Tiie author began by observing- that "mankind," it had been said, was going
through a great fusion. It was being- made one, not by conquest, not by the spread
of a creed, but by the interchange of commodities, a proposition which it was to be
feared could only be accepted as true in a very qualified sense. Commerce and
the natural wants of mankind were no doubt efficient agents in bringing different

--races into communication with each other opening up new countries, and predis-

posing populations to spread by intercourse, by the interchange both of products
and of ideas. But it was not the less true that commerce only opened the way, and

quite as often excited jealous fears and gave way to hostile feelings, ending in con-
quest or civil convulsion and bloodshed. The tendency of the present day was
rather to attribute too much to commerce as an efficient agency whether for civili-
zation or peace. It often brought two totally dissimilar races into sudden contact
in the aggressive march of western civilization and commerce eastward, and very
seldom without collision and conflict. Between the moral and the physical there
was in this, as in other directions, a great analogy. In the material world new
forms and combinations were seldom effected without much effervescence and dis-
integration. Manj- dangerous elements were set free, and others which gave soli-
dity and permanence disappeared. So it often proved when new elements of

thought and civilization were brought into contact with the elder Asiatic forms
 of social life and government. So it had been in China as in Japan ; the feudal
 nobles of the latter empire, with a true instinct, saw that commerce never came
 alone, but brought in its track gerrns of social and political change which, sooner

or later, -would destroy the feudal power and institutions. These had existed from

time immemorial, and under them the nation had increased in numbers and in

wealth, preserved its independence, and been sell-sufficing-. They saw in the new

treaties, therefore, and the commerce they were intended to promote, an element

of revolution, and were prepared to resist to the death, and strike while it was yet

time. Commerce in this instance, as in a thousand others, so far from promoting

peace, was pregnant with danger, and to all appearance woidd sooner or later lead

to war, and this however little the merchant might desire such a residt, or govern-

ments might seek to avert it. Commerce, in truth, originated a movement which

not all the merchants in the world could arrest until its destined course was run.

Western Powers, and we especially, entered into treaties with Eastern Potentates

in perfect good faith, desiring- only commerce, and hoping peace and civilization

with the blessings of true religion might follow in the train. Such was not the

lesson that the history of the world gave. Theory and experience were wofully at

issue, and for once it would be well that experience should triumph over hope ; for

the first gave useful warning, while the latter only deluded by vain expectations. It

was under this aspect that it became a question of deep interest what affinities or

analogies might be found between the European and Japanese civilization now so

suddenly brought into contact, or what elements of repulsion might be existing and

active ; for on this, to all appearance, would depend the issue, whether peaceful or the

reverse. To speak of Japanese civilization was to speak of the whole life and deve-

lopment of a nation ; and there was as much difference between nations as indivi-

duals. Sir Rutherford then showed that there were great vagueness and diversity

of opinion as to what constituted civilization. The necessity of a clear definition

was obvious ; and by reference to the chief agencies employed, we shoidd be able

to discriminate between different kinds of civilization and degrees, and thus arrive

at a rough basis of classification. Man's first triumph was that of physical force

and intelligence combined over inanimate  nature                                   his  next,  and  by  the  same
                                                                                ;

means, was over the higher animals of his own species ! All the earlier forms of

civilization were of this kind in various degrees. When it was proposed to govern

man by argument rather than by force, by considerations and by motives addressed

to his reason and conscience rather than to his fears, leaving him the full develop-

ment of his faculties and the free use of all his energies, then civilization took its

best and highest form. But of this civilization there was very little, even in the
Wewestern world, as yet.
                          shoidd be prepared, therefore, to estimate modestly

any benefit in our power to confer on a race like the Japanese by introducing our

civilization and institutions into Japan, and Ave shoidd be patient if we saw that

the Japanese adhered with tenacity to their feudalism and autocratic forms of
government, and not only wished none of our novelties or innovations, but, on

the contrary, were ready to do battle rather than permit the fine edge of the com-
mercial wedge to be inserted. They (the Japanese) might tell us with truth that
for centuries they had possessed, under their own laws, customs, and institutions,

a degree of peace, prosperity, and freedom from foreign wars which no country in

Europe had enjoyed any single century of its existence, with all our boasted civi-
Howlization.
              the civilization of a people might most readily be estimated was a

question of some interest. Mr. Meadows, in his work upon China, suggested that

the style and character of a nation's architecture (exclusive of edifices for warlike

purposes), the roads, means of communication, and adaptation for travelling were

the best criteria. This seemed doubtful. In Japan the soil was afflicted with a

sort of quotidian ague by reason of earthquakes, and in architecture, as also in roads,

the Japanese might vie with the Romans, so admirably were they engineered and

maintained. But when we come to their ordinary means of travelling and com-
Amunication, they sink far below the lowest of European States.
                                                                                                    naked foot-

runner made their post; a buffalo car, or an equally clumsy machine, carried on

men's shoulders, was their usual conveyance ; and this despite their knowledge by

working models and books of our system of railroads and telegraphs. It was evi-

dent all these criteria could only furnish very fallacious data for judgment ; for in

--other directions in. their conquest over matter and their progress in all the indus-
--trial arts they might vie with the most advanced nation in Europe. In all the

mechanical arts the Japanese had unquestionably achieved great excellence. In

 their porcelain, their bronzes, their silk fabrics, their lacquer, and their metallurgy
 generally, including works of art, in design and execution they not only rivalled

the best artistic works of Europe, but could produce in each of these departments
some of those of Europe. It was quite true tbat Europe might also make a similar
boast with justice, for there was much, especially in the province of art properly
so called, to which the Japanese could not make the slightest pretensions. They
could not produce such works of art as might be seen in the International Exhibi-

tion in repousse from the chisel of a Yechte and a Monti. Neither could they rival
a Landseer or a Rosa Bonheur. Indeed, they were wholly ignorant of oil paint-
ing, and no great adepts in water colour. In the outlines of animals, however,
they had a most facile pencil. In enamels, in the manufacture of steel, and in silk
fabrics, they could compete with the rest of the world, as also in their finer and
egg-shell porcelain. The tendency of their government unfortunately, under a
feudal rule and a feudal aristocracy, was utterly repressive of all free action or

development of the faculties. Any evidence of individuality and originality would

be fatal to a Japanese under the worse than Venetian rule of feudal chiefs. This
was the one great obstacle to the development of commerce and the maintenance
of peaceable relations ; for the privileged classes, composed of some 600 daimios, and
their feudal retainers, comprising an army of some 200,000 men, sworn and ready
to obey all the behests of their chiefs, held the whole popidation in the most abso-

lute subjection. And the hostility of these amied classes was neither to be softened

nor conciliated. They foresaw, or thought they did, in the train of foreign trade,
elements threatening destruction to all the institutions of the country, and fore-
most of these the feudalism which constituted them lords of all the soil and abso-
lute rulers. This was the more to be regretted because the Japanese as a people
had no hostility to foreigners, and were possessed of so many excellent qualities
and such an aptitude for a higher civilization than they had yet attained, that
within a very few years not only might we see them make a great and exampled
advance, but a trade developed to which it was really difficult to fix any limit.

On the Climate of the Channel Islands*. By Professor Ansted, F.R.S.

                                               Guernsey.

The climates of the Channel Islands are so essentially different both from those

of the adjacent lands of France and England and also from each other, and they offer

so many points of interest connected with the influence of the Atlantic currents

on climate, that they deserve special attention. Its relative position marks out

Guernsey as the typical island, and observations justify this conclusion. It is,

therefore, fortunate that the elements of the climate of Guernsey have been better

established than those of the other islands. Pr. Hoskins, F.R.S., is the observer

to whose labours these valuable materials are due. The annexed Table gives these

results to the end of 1858. Since then the weather has been exceptional.

--Compared with Greenwich, the residts are very interesting.

1. Temperature. The mean annual temperature is 51^°, and the annual means

in sixteen years have at no time exceeded this by 2°, or fallen short of it by 1|°.

At Greenwich the adopted mean temperature being 49°, this shows an increment of

--2i° nearly corresponding with the difference due to latitude. But the real differ-

ence is not this. It arises from the very much smaller range in the small island.

Thus the mean autumn temperature is four degrees, and the winter six degrees,

higher than at Greenwich, while the spring is only one degree warmer, and the

summer half a degree cooler.  The months  show this more  clearly                             for December
                                                                                           ;

and January are each seven degrees wanner, and May and June one degree cooler.

On the whole, the spring in Guernsey is a little warmer, and the summer rather

cooler, than at Greenwich, while the temperature of July and August continues,

with little change, into September and October. Winter is therefore absent as a

season, but spring is cold and late.

   The general result shows a greater variability in the climate of Jersey. The
daily range during six years of mutual good observation was 11-6° in Jersey and 8°
in Guernsey, and the mean monthly range 27"9° and 206° respectively. All these

particulars of climate are further illustrated by a careful comparison of tabulated

results.

   The barometric pressure in Jersey generally varies less than in Guernsey; and the
two islands by no means correspond in range or actual pressure. They occupy

different positions with regard to the great atmospheric wave.

   Jersey is less cloudy than Guernsey; the number of days of rain-fall is smaller,
and the quantity of rain is also smaller. The two islands are exceedingly dif-
ferent in respect to humidity, both in amount and season. The monthly range of

humidity is greatest in Jersey.

On the whole, Jersey is drier and warmer than Guernsey, and has a clearer atmo-

sphere                            it is hotter in summer and cooler in winter.  The pressure of the air varies
                               ;

less frequently, but within larger limits ; heavier rain falls there, but more rain

falls in the year, and it falls on more days, in Guernsey.

The climates of Alderney and Sark have not been carefully observed. It is

generally considered that both are more bracing than the larger islands.

  AAll the Channel Islands agree in some general conditions of the climate.

general summary of these will be useful.
   The equability and duration of autumn are, in ordinary seasons, extremely re-

markable. Storms, and occasional heavy rains, usher in this season ; but they are
not succeeded by cold. In the intervals, up to the end of the year, the weather

is remarkably fine and genial, with no night frosts. From the 10th October to the
end of the month is what is called St. Martin's summer, and the weather is then
singularly agreeable. The same kind of weather often recurs in the middle of

December.

   During the spring months, east, north-east, and north winds, and sometimes
north-west winds, are frequent and violent, and often extremely disagreeable. They
feel cold, but do not bring down the thermometer. They are often very dry. The
night temperature is still comparatively high, hoar frost being rarely seen, except
in exposed, bleak, and high positions, and in the months of January and February.
February is the coldest month of the year.

   The days in summer are rarely hot ; the nights are cool and pleasant, almost
without exception. The latter part of summer is generally fine and pleasant,
passing into early autumn without perceptible change.

A Journey to Hawaii in Padan-Aram and thence over Mount Gilead into the

    Promised Land. By Charles T. Beke, Ph.D., F.8.A., F.B.G.8., <Sfc*

    Towards the close of the year 1861, Dr. Beke, accompanied by his wife, under-
took a journey to Harran, the residence of the Patriarch Terah and his descendants,
and thence over Mount Gilead into the Promised Land, by the road taken by the
Patriarch Jacob in his flight from his father-in-law Laban.

    Harran is a village situate at the eastern extremity of the Ghuthdh or Plain of
Damascus, which Dr. Beke identifies with the Land of Uz (Hiitz) of the Book of
Jobf. It is usually distinguished as Harran-el-Awamid, or Harran of the Columns,
from three Ionic columns, which, with numerous other remains, prove that in the

intervening ages there was here a Greek or Roman city. The name of this city is

lo3t, Harran having resumed its Scriptural appellation before the twelfth century,

when it was described by the Arabian geographer Yakut as " one of the towns of
the Ghuthah of Damascus."

   At the entrance from the west is a draw-well of great antiquity, which Dr. Beke
identifies with the well at which Abraham's steward, Eliezer of Damascus, met
Rebekah. Some of the water has been analysed at the Royal School of Mines, by

direction of Sir Roderick I. Murchison, and found to contain 109-76 grains of solid

matter in the gallon. The water of a second well near the former is so impure as
to be no longer fit for use, and at the present day the inhabitants obtain their chief

supply of water through an artificial canal.

   On the first day of the present year (1862), the travellers left Harran on their

-- --way to Mount Gilead. They first came to the river Awaj, the ancient Pharpar,

forming with the Barada the Abana of Scripture the two " Rivers of Damascus,"
the capital of Aram or Syria ; which rivers gave to Aram Naharaim, or " Aram of

the Two Rivers," its distinguishing appellation. This district, though not incor-

rectly called "Mesopotamia of Syria," has been supposed to be the Mesopotamia of
Assyria, between the two rivers Euphrates and ligris, whence have arisen con-
siderable errors in Scripture geography and history.

   When, according to the Scripture narrative, Laban set "three days' journey"

between his flocks and those of his son-in-law Jacob, it is reasonable to infer that

the latter led his flocks in the direction best adapted for his contemplated flight

from Padan-Aram; that is to say, up the left bank of the Awaj. The spot where
he crossed the river would consequently have been at or near Kiswe, a town on
the great pilgrim-road between Damascus and Mekka ; and thence he would have

proceeded south over the plains of Harran. This is the road taken by Dr. Beke

--and certainly nothing could so graphically describe it as the few simple words of

Scripture : " He passed over the river, and set his face toward the Mount Gilead."

A traveller, however much unacquainted with the country, has only to proceed

along the high road, running straight from north to south over an almost level
plain, without a mountain intervening to lead him astray, and he soon sees before

him the summit of Gilead, standing out separately and distinctly, and towards it

he "sets his face."

The distance travelled by Jacob before Laban "overtook him in the Mount

Gilead" is stated to have been "seven days' journey." Travelling much quicker

than the patriarch coidd have done, it was on their fifth day from Harran that Dr.

and Mrs. Beke ascended the side of Gilead, where they soon came to some deli-

cious springs of water in the midst of luxuriant pasturage. At such a spot the

Patriarch Jacob, with his wearied flocks and herds, would naturally have stopped

Aand pitched his " tent in the mount," where he was overtaken by Laban.  few

minutes more brought the travellers to the summit of Gilead, where they enjoyed

an extensive view over the Promised Land, embracing Mount Tabor, Nazareth,

Cana, Tiberias, and other places rendered ever memorable by Our Lord's ministry

and miracles. After the reconciliation between Laban and Jacob, it is said that

" Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him, .... and he called the

name of the place Mahanaim." Close to where Dr. Beke crossed the summit of

Gilead is a ruin called Mahneh, which may be looked on as representing the spot

where the patriarch, on his first coming within sight of his native country after an

absence of twenty years, was favoured with this manifestation of the Divine pre-

sence.

   Shortly after leaving the pass of the mountain, Dr. and Mrs. Beke came to a
cromlech, in form and appearance almost identical with Kits-Coty House, in Kent.

Thence proceeding down Wady Ajlun, and then crossing Wady Rajib, they reached
the Ghor, or plain of the Jordan, not far to the north of Wady Zerka, the river

Jabbok of Scripture, over which the Patriarch Jacob crossed before meeting his

brother Esau, and where " there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of
the day ; . . . . and Jacob called the name of the place Peniel."'

   After his meeting with his brother, Jacob, professing to accompany him, journeyed
to Succoth, " leading on softly," and there stopped to " build him an house, and make

booths for his cattle ; " whilst " Esau returned that day on his way imto Seir."

Succoth has been supposed to be on the west side of Jordan, a few miles to the

north of the Jabbok ; but the whole context shows that the patriarch, in order to get
free from his brother, pretended to be going on with him towards Seir, but stopped
all at once, as if weary, at Succoth, whilst Esau unsuspectingly continued his

journey. Succoth is accordingly placed by Dr. Beke at a short distance to the

south of the Jabbok, on the east side of Jordan. Crossing here the river, the pa-

triarch would, on the opposite side, have entered the mouth of Wady Far'a, where

it joins the Jordan from the north-west, and continuing up the valley, he at length

" came to Shaleni, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he
came from Padan-Aram, and pitched his tent before the city."

   Dr. and Mrs. Beke, being unable to obtain an escort to accompany them as far
south as the Jabbok, crossed the Jordan at the point where they first reached it.
While proceeding along the opposite bank, they were attacked by a party of
Beduins ; after freeing themselves from whom, they at once crossed the mountains

between the Ghor and Wady Far'a, where they again fell into the road taken by

the Patriarch Jacob, along which they continued to Nablus, the ancient Shechem,

arriving there on the tenth day after their departure from Harran.

    On the Geography of Mont Pelvoux, in Dauphine.

        By the Eev. T. G. Bonnet, M.A., F.G.S.

   This district of the Alps is very imperfectly laid down on all the maps at present

-- Apublished. The following are the principal authorities known to me : -(1.) map

by General Bourcet, published at Paris in the year 1758. It is a most laborious

performance, and very accurate for all parts below the snow-line, but above that of

Alittle use. (2.) paper by M. Elie de Beaumont, in the 'Annales des Mines,'

omc ggrie) tome v. In this there is some very valuable information, but given in

so confused a manner, that it requires a thorough knowledge of the district to un-

Aderstand it. (3.) most interesting article on Dauphine, by Professor Forbes, at

the end of his work on Norway and its Glaciers (published 1853). He did not,

however, pierce the "massif" of the Pelvoux, and consequently, being misled by

Bourcet's map, he speaks of it as a single mountain, overhanging the valley of La

ABerarde. (4.) paper by Mr. Whyinper, in the second volume of the second series

of  ' Peaks, Passes,  and Glaciers'  (published  in  1862                      This gentleman ascended,
                                                                          ').

for the first time on record, the highest peak of the Pelvoux, but misunderstanding

Elie de Beaumont, he has fallen into several topographical errors. The Pelvoux
was also ascended during the past summer by Mr. Tuckett, of Bristol, who was

the first person to clear up the difficulties about the heights and names of the

mountain. On his return through Paris, he saw at the Departement de la Guerre
the manuscript map made from Capt. Durand's survey in 1828. He obtained a

tracing of the district in the immediate neighbourhood of the Pelvoux, of which

he has kindly sent the author a copy. It is impossible to speak in too high terms

of commendation of this map, but unfortunately it will not ( as he was informed

at the Department) be published for five years. The chief features of the district

are as follows. The watershed between the Romanche and the Durance, after

passing the Col du Lautaret and running south for some four miles, turns to the

south-west for about three miles, and then turns to the south again, passing through

the Pointe des Ecrins (the highest mountain in the group), 13,462 feet, and l'Aie-

froide, 12,878 feet. Where the line turns to the south, a large offshoot runs in a

north-westerly direction, in which are the Aiguille du Midi de la Grave, 13,081 feet,

and the great Glacier du Mont de Lans. From the Pointe des Ecrins a short spur

runs out to the east, dividing the Glaciers Blanc and Noir. From the Ale'froide

another large spur runs out to the east, terminating in the Grand Pelvoux, 12,973

--feet. This portion of the chain may be said to consist of four distinct peaks (1)
l'Alefroide, two rocky aiguilles without name, 11,772 feet ? and 12,845 feet ? re-

spectively, and the Grand Pelvoux, with its five heads. Besides these there are

several other mountains in the district, from 11,000 to a little over 12,000 feet. The

authority for the heights is a list obtained by Mr. Tuckett from the Etat-Major

Francais. The scenery of this part of Dauphine is of the grandest description

some of the snow-fields and glaciers are of great extent, and the magnificent pre-

cipices that surround them equal, if they do not surpass, anything that can be found

in Switzerland or Savoy.

      On Colour as a Test of the Races of Man. By J. Crawfurd, F.R.S.

   Colour in different races appeared to be a character imprinted upon them from

the beginning, because, as far as our experience 'goes, neither time, climate, nor
locality has produced any change. Egyptian paintings 4000 years old represent

the people as they are now. The Parsees in India who went from Persia are now

Spaniards settled in tropical America remain as fair as the people of Arragon and

Andalusia. lie contended that climate had no influence in determining colour in

different races. Fins aud Laps, though further north, are darker than the Swedes

and within the Arctic circle we find Esquimaux of the same colour and complexion

as the Malays under the Equator. Yellow Hottentots and Bushmen live in the

immediate neighbourhood of Black Caffres and negroes. There is as wide a dif-

ference between the colour of an African negro and a European, between a Hindoo

and a Chinese, and between an Australian and a Bed American, as there is between

the species of wolves, jackals, and foxes. The arguments for the unity of the human

race drawn from anatomical reasoning would also prove that there was no difference

between hogs and bears, the bovine and equine and the canine families.

    On Language as a Test of the Races of Man. By J. Ceawfurd, F.R.S.

   The author commenced by observing that on former occasions he had referred to
the subject of this paper, but now he did not hesitate at once to affirm that lan-
guage, though yielding valuable evidence of the history and migrations of man,
affords no sure test of the race he belongs to. In illustration he said that the
majority of the people of this country, who 2000 years ago spoke their own native
tongues', whatever those might have been, now spoke a language derived from
Germany, on which has been engrafted a considerable portion of one which had
its origin in Italy, while of their native tongues two examples only remained, and

these, without doubt, were doomed in a few generations to extinction as living lan-

guages. France, Egypt, Northern India, the New "World, and other regions, also

exhibited cogent illustrations of a similar character, one of the most important
being the fact, well ascertained, that, so wonderful is the flexibility and compass of

the human organs, the children of races the most opposite, when duly taught from

infancy, will acquire a complete mastery over any foreign languages, be they ever

so difficult of pronunciation or complex in structure.

Some Observations on the Psychological Differences which exist among the Typical

                Races of Man. By Robeet Dunx, FJR.C.S. Engl.

   The object of the author in this paper was to indicate and suggest to the
psychological and ethnological Members of the British Association a field of in-

vestigation and inquiry, which, in his estimation, if thoroughly explored, could not
fail, unless he was greatly mistaken, of yielding a rich harvest, and of throwing a
flood of light upon "the causes of the psychological differences which exist among

the typical races of man. He maintains that the Genus Homo is one, and that all
the races of the great family of man are endowed with the same instinctive intui-

--tions, sensational, perceptive, and intellectual, the same mental activities, in other

words, that they all have as constituent elements the germs or original principles
in common, of amoral, religious, and intellectual nature, so that, however great aud

striking their psychological differences may be, they are nevertheless differences in

degree, and not of kind.
   Viewing the brain or encephalon as the material organ of the mind, where the

ultimate molecular changes precede the mental states, and from whence the man-
dates of the will issue, whether for the production of voluntary motion or for other

acts of volition, he dwells on the paramount importance of assiduously studying,

and carefully comparing and contrasting, the cerebral developments of the different
races, with a view, and as the most efficient means, to the better understanding
and elucidation of the psychological differences which exist among and characterize
them. But the cerebral physiology of the typical races remains to be wrought out,
and ethno-psychology is still a desideratum."' Significant among them as the vary-

ing forms of the skull maybe, and important as is the division of the whole human

family, by Retzius, into Dolichocephalic and Brachycephalic, with its sub-divi-

sion, according to the upright or projecting character of the jaws, into orthognathous

aud prognathous, and as characterizing and indicating deration and degradation of
type, the author considers that the time has come not to be satisfied with a mere

external survey, but that the bony coverings should be removed, and, under the

guidance of the chart provided by the indefatigable G-ratiolet, the cerebral convo-

lutions themselves should be thoroughly examined, and carefully compared and

contrasted with each other, in all the typical races. When this has been done, but

not until then, shall we, in his opinion, have a clue likely to unravel and elucidate

many of the existing obscurities appertaining to their psychological differences.

Much as it is to be regretted that the brains of the lowest and most degraded of
the human races have been so little examined, it is now to be hoped that, in respect

to the aboriginal tribes at the Cape of Good Hope, in Australia, and, within reach,
the Hill Men of India, as well as elsewhere, medical men will be found to supply
this desideratum of ethno-psychology. This accomplished, he thinks we shall

cease to wonder how it happens that the North American Indians, on the very

confines of civilization, should remain uncivilized--the same wandering lawless

savages which they were when Columbus first set his foot among them ; how their

wigwams and the miserable bark huts of the aborigines of New Holland shoidd

have been swept away before the flood-tide of European civilization--those home-

less savages themselves seeking refuge in the desert and the mountain ; and, again,

among the Mongolian nations of Asia, that we shall be better enabled to compre-

hend how it is that their civilization, so early attained, has not progressed, but re-

mained stationary : China, boasting of a civilization nearly as old as that of Egypt,
has remained stationary for thirty centuries. Lastly, even among the European

nations, the distinctive characters of the Saxon and the Celt, he is inclined to be-

lieve, will be found to be engraven on their brains.

   As instances from savage life, he views, in contrast, the African Negro and the

North American Indian, with the intent of showing, so far as the subject has

hitherto been investigated, what light the differences in their cerebral developments

can throw on their respective characters, mental manifestations, and destinies.

Among the Negro tribes there is a great variety, and much difference in their

mental endowments. Some have become excellent mechanics, others clerks and

accountants, while others have remained mere labourers, incapable of any intellec-

tual attainments, and characterized by low and receding foreheads. When free

from pain and hunger, the life of the Negro is one of enjoyment. As soon as his

toils are for a moment suspended, he sings, he seizes his fiddle, he dances.   Easily

                                                                              _

excitable, and in the highest degree susceptible of all the passions, he is more

especially so of those of the mild and gentle affections. The American Indians, on

the contrary, are averse to civilization, and slow in acquiring knowledge. They are

restless, stern, silent, and moody, and to them a ruminating life is a burden. They

are revengeful, wild, vindictive, cunning, but wholly destitute of maritime adven-

ture ; too°dangerous to be trusted by the white man in social intercourse, and too

obtuse and intractable to be worth coercing into servitude.

   The Negro is DolicJwcephalic, the Indian Brachycephalic, and both are progna-
thous. Their cranial and cerebral differences are striking. The skull of the Negro

is long, but narrow, and the forehead low, but it rises higher, and is more developed

in the intellectual and moral regions, than that of the Indian ; the occiput is large.

In the Red Indian the skull is small, and short from front to back ; it is wide be-

tween the parietal protuberances, prominent at the vertex, and flat at the occiput
its great deficiency lies in the superior and lateral parts of the forehead. The ante-

rior lobe of the brain in the Negro and Indian is small, while in the European it is

large, in proportion to the middle lobe. The posterior lobe of the Indian is small,

but the vertex of the middle lobe is prominent, and the brain is wide between the

parietal protuberances. In the Negro the posterior lobe is more fully developed,

but it is in the European brain that it reaches its maximum development. Both

in the Negro and Indian the cerebral hemispheres are pointed and narrow in front,

and their transverse convolutions in the frontal lobes are markedly conspicuous
for the simplicity and regularity of their arrangement, and for the perfect symmetry

which they exhibit in both of the hemispheres, when compared and contrasted

with the complexity and irregularity which are presented in the brain of the

European. Such differences as these, the author considered, warrant the inference

that, alike in the Negro and the Indian, the nervous apparatus of the perceptive
and intellectual consciousness falls far short of that fulness, elaboration, and com-

1862.                                                        10

plexity of development which characterize the Caucasian brain ; and hence the

reason why the large-brained European differs from and so far surpasses the small-

brained savage in the complexity of his manifestations, both intellectual and moral.
In conclusion, he observed that the leading characters of the various races of man-

kind have been maintained to be simply representatives of a particular type in the
development of the highest or Caucasian ; the Negro exhibiting permanently the

imperfect brow, projecting lower jaw, and slender bent limbs of the Caucasian child
some considerable time before its birth, the aboriginal Americans representing the
same child nearer birth, and the Mongolian the same newly born.

 Exploration clans VAfrique centrale, de Serre-Leone a Alger, par Timbuctu.

                                     By Jules Gerard.

  On leaving Sierra Leone, the author proposed to visit the source of the Niger,
and also to visit the Republic of Liberia. He should then make for the Kong

Mountains, between which district and Timbuctoo a differentrace of natives was

foimd. He did not propose to travel with a caravan, but with the tribes of the
district. At Timbuctoo, or Ain Saleh, he hoped to discover the papers and journals
of Major Laing, the African traveller, who was assassinated near Timbuctoo. The

author expressed a confident belief that these papers were still in existence, since
the natives of the interior had almost a superstitious veneration for written cha-
racters, and treasured the most worthless scraps until long after they were illegible.
His route would be through a country possessing a double interest, both geogra-
phical and ethnological. The journey was long and perilous ; but he had weighed

the difficulties of the route, and confidently expected to make his way from Sierra

Leone to Algeria in safety.

A Letter from Dr. Livingstone, communicated by Sir Eoderick Murchison.

                                                                     " Shupanga, Eiver Zambesi, April 29, 1862.

 --My" dear Sir Roderick Murchison, With a sore, sore heart I must tell you of

the loss of my much-loved wife, whose form was laid in the grave yesterday

morning. She died in Shupanga-house on the evening of the 27th, after about

seven days' illness. I must confess that this heavy stroke quite takes the heart

out of me. Everything else that has happened only made me more determined to

overcome ; but with this sad stroke I feet crushed and void of strength. Only three

short months of her society after four years' separation ! I married her from love,
Aand the longer I lived with her I loved her the more.
                                                        good wife, and a good,

kind, brave-hearted mother was she, and deserved all the praises you bestowed on

her at our parting dinner, for teaching her own, and the native children too at

Kolobeng. I try to bow to the blow as from our Heavenly Father, who orders all

things for us. Some may afford to be stoical, but I should not be natural if I did
not shed many tears over one who so deserved them. I never contemplated expo-

sing her in the lowlands. I proposed that the Nyassa steamer should sail out, and
on reaching Kongone cut wood and steam up the river. This involved but a few
days in the lowlands ; but another plan was preferred. She (i. e. the steamer) came

in pieces in a brig. Gladly accepting the kind offer of Captain Wilson, of her

Majesty's ship ' Gorgon,' to help us up to the Murchison cataracts, we found by a

month's trial that the state in which the engines were precluded ascending the

WeShire with the pieces on board the 'Pioneer.'  were forced to put her together

at Shupanga, and we have been three months, instead of three or four days, down

--here. Had my plan been adhered to but why express useless regrets ? All had

been done with the best intentions. But you must remember how I hastened the

first party away from the Delta, and though I saved them, got abused for breaking

the Sabbath. Then I prevented Bishop Mackenzie's party landing at all, till these

same unhealthy months were past, and no one perished until the bishop came down

to the unhealthy lowlands and died. The Portuguese have taken advantage of the

sanitary knowledge we have acquired, and send their tete at once. They lost but

two of a detachment, while formerly, by keeping them at Quillimane and Senna,

nearly all were cut off.

On Serious Inaccuracies in the Great Survey of the Alps, south of Mont Blanc,

   as issued by the Government of Sardinia. By W. Mathews, Jun., M.A.,

    F.G.S.

   The maps referred to were the six-sheet map of Savoy and Piedmont which
appeared in 1841, the great ninety-one-sheet map now in course of publication, and
that attached to the work entitled ' Le Alpi che cingono lTtalia,' dated 1845,
all of which were issued by the War Department of the Sardinian Government.
Among the many cases of error, the most extraordinary was that of the Mont

Ise"ran, a mountain stated to be nearly 13,300 feet high, hitherto supposed to be

the culminating peak of the Graian Alps, and represented as situated in Savoy,

immediately on the east of the Col of the same name. From investigations made
in the country by Mr. Mathews and other travellers since the year 1859, it was now

conclusively established that no such peak exists in the situation in which it is placed
by the Sardinian engineers. The height of the so-called Mont Iseran was deter-
mined trigonometrically at the commencement of the present century by Colonel
Coraboeuf, of the Etat-Major Francais, and on referring to his original memoir, it
appears that the peak he measured is situated in Italy, and is, in fact, the Grand
Paradis, a mountain nearly fifteen miles distant from the supposed site of the Mont
Ise'ran. Mr. Mathews next described the position of the eight principal summits
of the Graian Alps, rising above 12,000 feet, most of which had been ascended for
the first time, and their altitudes determined, by members of the Alpine Club

within the last three years. He showed that these mountains were most incor-

rectly represented on the maps, and stated his conviction that the main Alpine

ranges had been roughly drawn in the office of the War Department and never

properly surveyed.

Decipherment of the Phoenician Inscription on the Newton Stone, Aberdeen-

                           shire. By the Rev. Dr. Mill.

The subject of this paper was an inscribed stone, found at a village in Aberdeen-

shire, some miles from the coast, and in a country containing many of what are

commonly called Druidical monuments. Dr. Mill read the inscription backwards,

decided that the letters were Phoenician, and explained them by the corresponding

letters of the Hebrew alphabet. According to his interpretation, it was a votive

monument dedicated to Eshmun, god of health (the Tyrian Esculapius), in grati-

--tude for favours received during " the wandering exile of me thy servant," the

dedicator being " Han-Thanit-Zenaniah, magistrate, who is saturated with sorrow."

Dr. Mill discussed the question whether Han-Thanit-Zenaniah had suffered from

disease or shipwreck, and whether his sorrow had been caused by the loss of com-

Hepanions, or friends, or relations.  discussed also the peculiarity of the word

used in the signification of magistrate, and pointed out that he appeared to have

been a man of consular dignity who had commanded a ship or fleet which came to

Britain, and that this and other circumstances pointed to the earlier period of the

history of Tyre.

            On Recent Notices of the Bechabites. By Signor Pierotti.

   Towards the end of April 1860, the author, travelling south of the Dead Sea, and
in a valley about two miles therefrom, met a tribe of Rechabites, whose object was
to procure a supply of linen and salt; the next day another tribe arrived, on a

--similar errand ; these all described themselves as descendants of Ishmael a mis-

take of course if they were really Rechabites. which they also claimed to be.

--They were exceedingly clean in their dresses and persons cleaner than any other

Bedouins ; but the most singular point connected with them was that they had a.

copy of the Scriptures in Hebrew. With regard to tlieir being descendants of

Rechab, they quoted Jeremiah xxxv. 4-7. They stated themselves to be 609,000

in number, thus confirming the prophecy, and the chief location of the tribes to be

the south-east of the Mountains of Moab. Their general sojourn is on the west

shore of the Dead Sea, and some of their members had been heard to say prayers

Aat the tomb of a Jewish rabbi, in the Hebrew language.  rabbi named Gadd fell

into their hands, and was robbed of everything, but bewailing his loss in the words

commencing "Hear, Israel, the Lord our God is one God," and being overheard,
the tribe who had robbed him returned him all the spoil. He endeavoured to

induce them to part with a copy of their Scriptures, which he actually saw, but

they said that money was of no consequence to them, and that the books were very

expensive in transcription.

On Terrestrial Planispheres. By the Chevalier Ignazio Villa.

On the Trade of the Eastern Archipelago with New Guinea and its Islands.
                   By Alfeed R. Wallace, F.B.G.S., F.Z.S.

  The part of New Guinea with which trade is regularly maintained extends from

the eastern extremity of the great Geelvink Bay, in about long. 137° E., to very

nearly the same longitude on the south coast, a little beyond the river Utauata.
This is a coast-line of more than 1200 miles, and it embraces also the islands of

Jobie, of Biak and Sook, Waigiou, Salwatty, Batanta, Mysol, and the Ke and Aru

Islands, all of which are inhabited b}r branches of the Papuan race.

  From the interior parts of New Guinea the only articles of commercial import-

ance are aromatic barks and wild nutmegs. From the coasts and islands, tripang or

beche-de-mer, pearl-shell, and tortoiseshell are all obtained in abundance, and form

the most valuable portion of the trade. Less hi quantity and importance are pearls,

sago (raw and in cakes), birds of paradise, mats, palm-leaf boxes, and rice in the

husk (paddy). These articles are mostly consumed in the East, some (as the aro-

matic Mussoi bark) in Java, others (the tripang and pearls) in China, the pearl-

shell being the only article the whole of which finds its way to Europe.

   The trade is almost entirely carried on by native prahus from Celebes and the

--Moluccas rude vessels, sometimes built entirely without iron, carrying mat-sails

on a triangular mast, and altogether incapable of beating against the wind. They

therefore make but one voyage a year, going at the beginning of the west monsoon in

December and January, and returning with the east monsoon in July and August.

--The trade is entirely carried on by barter, calicoes, red cotton, bar-iron, choppers,

axes, cheap German knives, Chinese crockery, brass wire, coloured beads, silver

coins, tobacco, arrack, and opium being the articles chiefly in demand by the

natives, some being required in one district, while a different assortment is requisite

in another. In some parts, as at Dorey, Mysol, and Aru Islands, trade is carried on

with peace and regularity ; in others, as Jobie and the neighbourhood of Maclure's

Inlet, bargains are made by both parties fully armed and read}', should the nego-

tiations not prove satisfactory, to settle the matter by a deadly combat. In these

Earts scarcely a year passes but some traders are killed either in open combat or

 y hidden treachery, and whole crews are often massacred.

   To give some idea of the extent of this trade, I may mention that when I visited

the Aru Islands in 1857, there were 15 large prahus from Macassar, besides about

100 small ones from various other islands, and I estimated the value of the produce

which they took away at about £20,000.

Sago is the stall* of life in these countries, and the chief support of all engaged in

the New Guinea trade. To see sago manufactured by the natives is an extraordi-

Anary sight. whole tree-trunk, about 20 feet long and 5 feet in circumference, is,
Aby a few days' labour, converted into human food.
                                                    good-sized tree will produce

30 bundles of raw sago, weighing about 30 lbs. each bundle, and when baked yield-

ing about 60 cakes of 3 to a pound. Two of these cake? are a meal for a man, or
about 5 cakes per day ; and as a tree produces 1800 cakes, it gives food for one man

for about a year. The labour to produce the raw sago, by breaking up and washing

the pithy substance of the trunk, is about 10 days for one man, which labour pro-

vides him with food for a year. This great cheapness of food leads to excessive
laziness and misery. There is no stimulus to labour, and we find that the sago-
eaters have generally the most miserable of huts and the scantiest of clothing. In the
western islands of the Archipelago, where rice is the common food, and some regu-
lar labour and foresight are required to produce it, the populations are in general
more wealthy, more industrious, and more intelligent, and there is much more
likelihood of "introducing among them the rudiments of knowledge and civilization.

   The more detailed information given in the paper of which this is an abstract
was collected by myself during three voyages to various parts of the coasts and

islands of New Guinea, in the years 1857, 1858, and 1860, mostly undertaken in

native prahus, and with a view to the investigation of the natural history of the

country.

 On the Human Remains found in the course of the Excavations at Wro.veter.
                              By Thomas Weight, F.S.A.

   Mr. Wright stated that human remains had been found in the excavations at

--Uriconium under three different classes of circumstances : First were the ancient

Roman cemeteries outside the town, which had been partially explored last autumn,
and which were now under a course of further exploration. In an ethnological point

of view the discoveries here were of comparatively little use, because, as all the
interments hitherto discovered were by cremation, no skulls or other perfect bones

were found among the remains of the dead ; but we derived from them the know-

ledge of the important fact that the inhabitants of Uriconium continued to burn
their dead, and, in fact, seem to have had no other mode of burial, until the latest

period of the existence of the city, that is, after the Roman government had been

withdrawn from the island. Secondly, there were the remains of the inhabitants

of the town, men, women, and children, who had been massacred by the savage
barbarians when the city was taken and destroyed. He told several interesting

anecdotes of the circumstances under which these remains had been found ; and he
stated that the skulls of these people presented no peculiarities which might not
be found in any civilized town, such as Uriconium undoubtedly was. In the third

place came the' deformed skulls which had been the subject of so much discussion,
a discussion which seemed not yet to have led to any satisfactory result. He
described the circumstances and conditions under which these skulls had been

found, and stated reasons for suspecting that the interments belonged to a con-
siderably later date than had been supposed. His friend Dr. Henry Johnson, of
Shrewsbury, in a very able paper recently read before the Royal Society, had
undertaken to show that there are chemical elements in the earth in which these

remains lay which might have so far affected the substance of the bone as to render
it pliable and capable of becoming deformed after death. But, supposing this to

be the case, we seem to want entirely the mechanical cause of deformation. The
bodies were not buried sufficiently deep to have a weight of earth upon them ; in
fact, when buried, their graves must have been very shallow. No weight of build-
ings or of ruins had been laid upon them ; but, on the contrary, from the quantity

of small fibres of roots which are mixed with the earth, it appeared probable that
during the middle ages the spot had been covered with low brushwood, which was

usually the case with deserted ruins. He suggested that we can hardly understand
why such a cause, affecting bones in this field, should not equally affect the skulls
of the bodies interred in the adjacent churchyard; or why all the deformed skulls
in this field should have the same deformity, or why the other bones of the
body should not be similarly affected. The skulls of the Roman inhabitants,

found with a great weight of ruins upon them, have in no instance yet observed
undergone any similar deformity ; and it must be added that the few skulls not
deformed, found among these deformed skulls, were comparatively good types. It
is intended to have a fresh and more careful exploration of the ground, in the

hope that thereby some further light may be thrown on the subject.

                            STATISTICAL SCIENCE.

On ilie Progress of Instruction in Elementary Science among the Industrial
   Classes under Hie Science Minutes of the Department of Science and Art. By
   J. C. Bttckmaster, B.A.

   The author referred to the origin of mechanics' institutions, and the influence of
the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. The want of a better elementary
education was the great obstacle to further improvement. The Royal Dublin
Society, the old schools of design, and the industrial museums of Ireland and
Scotland were intended to promote, in a variety of ways, a more general know-
ledge of those arts and sciences which relate to our national industries. In
1852 all these institutions were united under the Board of Trade into a Depart-
ment of Science and Art. The old schools of design were superseded by drawing-
schools or schools of art, and 90 of these schools are now in active operation,

teaching the elements of art to 92,000 persons, of whom the larger number belong

to the working classes. In 1857 the bcience and Art Department was placed in
connexion with the Committee of Council on Education, and in 1859 a very com-
prehensive Minute was passed for aiding instruction in the elements of all the
natural and applied sciences. There is annually held at South Kensington an

examination for teachers of elementary science, which is free to all who give notice
of the subjects on which they propose to be examined. The State avoids all the
responsibility and expense of training teachers and providing them with employ-
ment. At the first examination, in November 1859, there were 57 candidates, of

whom 49 were successful ; in 1860 there were 89 candidates, of whom 75 were suc-
cessful ; in 1861 there were 103 candidates, of whom 97 were successful. By far the

larger number of certificates have been taken by elementary teachers ; but certifi-
cates have also been taken by a weaver, a printer, a wheelwright, clerks, and
assistants in shops. Wherever a class is established, there must be a local com-
mittee of at least five persons. This committee superintends the examination of
the pupils, which is conducted on the same principle as the Oxford middle-class
examinations. For every pupil of the industrial classes who has received 40 lessons
from the teacher, and who passes a satisfactory examination in the elements of the
subject taught, the teacher receives a payment of £1, and for every first, second, and
third grade Chieen's prizeman he receives higher payments. The successful pupils
receive rewards of books and medals. The department is merely an examining body
it does not pretend to interfere in any way with local organization and] authority.
All that is looked for is a successful residt, and on this the teacher receives his

payment. The examinations this year were held in May in 75 places ; 60 of these

were in connexion with mechanics' institutions. Last year only 563 pupils were

examined ; this year 1260, of whom 1038 were persons belonging to the industrial

classes, and their ages varied from 9 to 53 years.

On the Cotton Famine, and the Substitutes for Cotton. By David Chadwick,

          F.S.S., Honorary Secretary of the Manchester Statistical Society.

The civil war in America has stopped our supplies of cotton from the Southern

States, which during many years have supplied us with more than three-fourths

--of our total consumption. In 1860 we received the following supplies of cotton :

United States, 2,581,000 bales; Brazil, 103,000 bales ; Egypt, 109,000 bales ; West

Indies, 1000 bales; East Indies, 563,000 bales; total, 3,357,000 bales. The total

amounts of cotton imported into Liverpool in the two periods of 8i months were

respectively as follow:--To September 1861 (8i months), 2,508,672 bales; to

September 1862 (8± months), 725,917 bales; deficiency, 1,782,755 bales. The

Newaverage price of  Orleans cotton, in September 1861, was from 7|-d. to 10|rf.

per lb. ; in September 1862, from 24d. to 30d per lb. ; increase 16|d to 20d. per lb.,

or more than 200 per cent. In ordinary times the price of yarns (40's) has been

from 4cd. to 5d. per lb. more than the price of the raw cotton, and a proportionate

additional price for weaving. It is now (September 1862) no unusual thmg for the

spinner and manufacturer to take orders for the yarn and the cloth at the market price

on the day of sale of the raw cotton from which it was made. These facts may be

taken as sufficient to indicate the unparalleled extent of the present cotton crisis.

It has frequently been asked why the cotton manufacturers have allowed them-
selves to be to so large an extent dependent on one source of supply. It may be

answered that cotton-spinners, like all other tradesmen, have gone to the best and

cheapest market. The Southern States of America have hitherto supplied cotton

of a better and more uniform quality, in larger quantities, and at a cheaper rate than

any other country. "Why should the cotton manufacturer be blamed for doing that

which every other good tradesman does ? But Lancashire has not been unmind-

ful of the rapid increase in the consumption of cotton, and the danger of depending

so largely on one source of supply. Mr. Bright's committee on India twenty years
a?o, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce for the last twenty-five years, and the

Cotton Supply Association during the last few years have been continuously call-

ing the attention of all the countries capable of growing cotton to the necessity of

new sources of supply. India affords the means of supplying us with three-fourths

of all the cotton consumed in Great Britain, and the remainder of our wants could

be well supplied bv Brazil, West Africa, Egypt, Turkey, and Australia.   The mis-

                                                                        _

government of India, as shown by the want of roads, ports, and irrigation works,

and of that security for capital which will induce private enterprise, is the cause

of the vast resources of that great country remaining for so long a period compa-

ratively undeveloped. If contracts could be legally and more promptly enforced,

and the restrictions on the purchase of land removed, as recommended by Lord
Canning, Lord Stanley, and Mr. Laing, there would be some hope that India would

be able°to compete successfully with America in the cotton markets of the world.

Two years ago the Manchester Cotton Company was established, with a capital of
£1,000,000. The company entered into negotiations with the government, who

promised to make a new road leading from Darwhar to the new port of Sedashegur,
and to improve the harbour at the latter place. On the faith of these promises,

the company sent a special commission to India, a staff of engineers, mechanics,

workmen, and clerks, and have forwarded two shiploads of improved machinery

for cleaning and packing cotton. The cotton company find that the road and the
pier are not made as promised, and no reasonable progress is being made with the
work. The company's efforts have thus been frustrated, and an immense loss
sustained by the vexatious delay which has been occasioned. With such a result,

is it surprising that private capitalists refuse to embark in commercial enterprises
in India ? Other cotton companies have been started, viz., The Jamaica Cotton
Company, East India Cotton Agency Company, Venezuela Cotton Company, West-
                                                                        Company
ern  Australian  Cotton  Company,  East  India  Irrigation  and  Canal                                               ;  and

proposals have been made for a Natal Cotton Company, an Asia Minor Cotton

Companv, an Ottawa Cotton Company. How has the cotton famine affected

the working classes? There are upwards of 500,000 persons employed in the

cotton manufacture, of which nearly 400,000 are employed in Lancashire. It may

convey a better idea of this number to say that it is equal to 25 towns of 20,000
inhabitants each, all wholly engaged in the cotton trade. The engineers, mecha-

nics, and the workers in iron, steel, brass, copper, tin, and wood, and the shop-

keepers and other tradesmen supported by them, may be reckoned in addition at

halfthat number (250,000). The women and children and those not able to work,

and dependent entirely on the cotton operatives, may also be taken at 250,000.
The total number of persons dependent upon the cotton manufacture may therefore
be taken at 1,000,000 persons, of which 800,000 are in Lancashire and the imme-

diate neighbourhood. Lancashire, in 1861, contained 2,464,592 inhabitants, or

about one-eighth of the population of England and Wales. Of the 400,000 per-

sons usually employed in Lancashire, more than 150,000 are now entirely out of

employment, and more than 120,000 are working short time. Taking those working

short time at three days a week, and reckoning them at half the number (60,000),

it gives 210,000 persons now totally unemployed. By a careful investigation into the

rate of wages in 200 trades and occupations in Lancashire in 1859-60, the author

found that the average wages paid to the cotton factory operative was 10s. 3±<i each

per week, reckoning men, women, and children. Taking the average earnings of the

210,000 persons now thrown out of employment at 10s. per week, the total loss
152 report--1862.

amounts to £105,000 per week, or £1,365,000 per quarter, or £5,460,000 per year.

This estimate is likely to be doubled before Christmas next, and, including trades

dependent upon the cotton manufactures, the loss of wages may be taken at £200,000

Eer week. This grievous calamity falling upon an industrious, high-spirited, and
 itherto independent class of people, has found them comparatively unprepared to

meet the great emergency. Many who had saved a little money in savings-banks,

building-societies, and cooperative associations, have stinted themselves of the

actual necessaries of life rather than withdraw the whole of their hard-earned

savings. Others less provident, or having large families of young children, have

been compelled immediately on the cessation of work to apply for relief. Seeing

the great distress occasioned by a short supply of cotton, the important question

arises, have we any available substitutes ? The substitutes for cotton, or admix-

--tures, which have been proposed during the last few years may be stated as fol-

lows : Flax, the product of Linum usitatissimum, from nearly every country in the

world                                hemp, the product of a kind of nettle, Cannabis saliva, chiefly from Europe

his supposed secret, except upon impracticable terms. Samples of this fibre have

been freely submitted to the merchants on 'Change in Manchester and Liverpool,

and obtained general appreciation for their attractive appearance. They are long

harsh and rough to the touch. The samples show great delicacy in the shades of

object of testing all fibrous materials and ascertaining the purposes for which they

may be used. Samples were recently shown, and an offer made to supply forty

bales per week during the next twelve months, of a fibre said to be suitable for

mixing, which was strong, of good colour, and of a length and uniformity of staple

suitable for cotton machinery, thus presenting the three main conditions required

in a substitute for cotton. The price of this fibre, which appears like a mixture of

jute and rhea, is said to be less than half the present price of Surat cotton. To

cation or adaptation, we venture to recommend that they shotdd avoid secresy,

and avail themselves of the power of patenting their improvements, so that no

unnecessary delay may occur in putting to the test of practical experiment every

intelligent suggestion that may appear in any degree likely to afford relief to the
fearful distress now prevailing in the cotton districts. The'general feeling appears
to be that no new fibre is likely to be a substitute for cotton, but that several of
those proposed may be useful and valuable admixtures with cotton, silk, wool, flax,

and alpaca.

   In further illustration of the extent of the distress in the cotton districts, Mr.
Chadwick furnished tables compiled from the Reports of the Committee for the

Relief of Distress in the Manufacturing Districts, dated March 30, 1863.

On the Numerical Mode of estimating Educational Qualifications, as pursued at
    the G-reenwich Hospital ScJiool. By the Rev. Gr. Fishee, M.A., F.R.S.

   In Greenwich School, where there were 800 boys, he had adopted a numerical
method by which he could arrive at the attainments of any boy. For instance, in
writing, he had a standard book : in this book were descriptions of writing of five
degrees of quality, and the work produced was judged of according to these results,
fractions being used to represent any specimens which might be deemed in quality

Ato be between any of the five whole numbers representing the standards. similar

course was pursued regarding other subjects of instruction, and for examinations,

prizes, &c. He had also weighed his boys, and divided theni into three groups ac-

cording to their weight, the three groups vaiying from 90 lbs. to upwards of 100 lbs.
The result of this was that he found the heavy boys and the light ones, as a rule,

to possess much about the same amount of talent, whilst the boys who represented,
the medium possessed the largest amount.

   The author insists upon the importance of recognizing and preserving some
standard specimens of examination-questions in educational subjects, such as might
be generally agreed upon, as explanatory of their nature and difficulty, and which
might be adapted to a numerical scale of estimation, upon a plan similar to that
which he has carried out in this school with great success for more than twenty years.

By such means, absolute as well as relative values of acquirements can be assigned

to a considerable amoimt of accuracy, and the amount of educational work done in

various public and private schools be compared with each other. He submitted a

diagram to the Section exhibiting, by means of differently coloured lines adapted to

a scale, the attainments of the boys at different periods, keeping in view the same
standards of estimation. The author stated, in conclusion, that he had no motive
in making this communication beyond the desire of exciting attention to the sub-
ject, in order that it might lead to the adoption of a sound practical system of
testing and recording educational qualifications of a general character ; not simply
of a comparative and numerical kind (which is common in many educational esta-
blishments), but of a permanent nature, so as to be available for the future as well

as the present time, and that we may not be under the reproach of being " unable
to hand down to posterity, statistical information of such value as will mark the

progress of education."

      On Endowed Education and Oxford and Cambridge Fellowships.
                            By James Hetwood, F.R.S.

Mr. Heywood defined an endowment to be a charity, and explained that many of
154 report--1862.

the charities of the country were under the control of a Commission which sat in

St. James's Square. He thought it advisable that the Universities should be also

controlled by some influential board, such as the Committee of the Privy Council.

He next referred to what he considered to be the prejudicial influence which he

thought was often exerted upon the education of the country by the course of study

pursued at the University, and he quoted the instance of a school containing eighty
boys, in which scarcely anything was taught but classics and mathematics, simply

because a certain number of these boys were prepared for the Universities. He

thought that such an evil would be remedied if the course of study were more

--extended, and if other more practically useful subjects such as the modern lan-
--guages, natural and moral sciences were more encouraged in the University. He

also thought that the students of the University ought to be instructed in subjects

which would be more practically useful to them in after-life. He desired that some
scholarships and fellowships should be given to those who passed a successful

examination either in modern languages or in the moral or natural sciences.

  When the British Association for the Advancement of Science, some years ago,

met at Cheltenham, the Rev. Dr. Dobson, head master of the Cheltenham College,
was asked if more science could not be introduced into the Cheltenham College
system. In reply, the head master mentioned, that it was the general wish of the
parents who sent boys to the College at Cheltenham that their sons should have
that instruction which would enable them to obtain scholarships and fellowships at
Oxford and Cambridge. Dr. Dobson was of opinion that an alteration should first
be made in the requirements for scholarships and fellowships at the ancient English
universities, before changes could be effected in the public school system of this

country.

  A Royal Commission, presided over by the Earl of Clarendon, has, since that

time, been appointed to inquire into the state of the largest and most richly endowed

English public schools.

   At Oxford, in the majority of cases, college fellowships are exclusively bestowed

as the rewards of success in the classical examination for honours, at the time of
the Bachelor of Arts degree, and Latin composition is constantly required in all

the colleges of Oxford.
   College-fellowship examinations govern, in a large measure, the whole system of

higher endowed education in England and Wales.

Schoolmasters arej frequently selected for the largest grammar schools from the

Whenclass of college fellows.  installed into the chair of office, it is their highest

ambition that their pupils should succeed in obtaining college scholarships and

fellowships at Oxford and Cambridge.
   Dean Peacock, formerly fellow and tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge, strenu-

ously urged the abolition of exercises in Latin and Greek versification in academical
examinations on account of the time necessary to acquire the art of making verses

in dead languages, and the speedy loss of facility in composing such verses when
the practice of writing them had ceased for some years.

   In the examinations for college fellowships at Oxford and Cambridge, exercises
in the composition of Latin and Greek verses should no longer be set, and an
alternative should be allowed between prose composition in Latin and Greek and
more modern subjects, such as translations from English into French and German,

questions in English history, and exercises in English composition.
   There are about 500 or 600 fellowships in the two ancient Universities of Oxford

and Cambridge, of which at least 50 or 60 become vacant every year ; a larger pro-
portion of these academical rewards should be set apart for the encouragement of

science.

On the Prevention of Crime. By Edwin Hill, of the Inland Revenue Office.

                        " Crime walks thy streets, fraud earns her unblest bread ;
                          O'er want and woe thy gorgeous robe is spread."

   The author called attention to the large number of habitual criminals whose sole

--occupation is to plunder others a predatory class, harbouring in the very bosom

of society, and keeping its ground in undiminished numbers in spite of all the
                                              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                         155

forces brought to bear against it,--the residences of these enemies of society being,

for the most part, well known to the police, whole districts in London being notori-

ously peopled by them. In illustration of the magnitude of this evil, the following

particulars were given (in round numbers) from the 'Judicial Statistics ' for 1858
and 1861, for England and Wales.

The known thieves and receivers of stolen goods are stated to be 44,000 ; the

prostitutes, 29,000; suspected persons, 39,000; vagrants and tramps, 23,000;
making a total of 135,000 individuals believed to be living wholly, or for the
most part, by criminal practices. The houses of bad character inhabited or fre-

quented by criminals, 24,000. The cost of repressive measures paid by the rates
and taxes, for the year 1861, £2,548,000, in addition to the heavy expenses falling
upon individuals, and the loss of time incurred by witnesses, jurors, and others.
The loss of property from depredation was estimated by Mr. Kedgrave, for the year

1858, at seven millions and three-quarters, making a total loss of upwards of ten
millions per annum, attributable mainly to the class of habitual criminals.

   To give some idea of the number of crimes due to this class, it was stated that
London is believed to harbour some 5000 habitual depredators, who, if taken upon

the average to commit but one crime per day each, would commit upwards of a
million and a half of crimes in the year.

The moral evils were also noticed ; the dread and anxiety suffered by thousands,

especially the aged, the feeble, and the timid, the crimes of a few desperate men
sometimes spreading panic through the whole country*; the contamination of

the young, especially of the children of the honest working man, who often has no
means   of escaping

                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the children born amidst crime, who, if they have not the good fortune to die
early, have no possible escape from the contamination that surrounds them--many
being even beaten into crime, and destined to fall ultimately into the grasp of the
law to have these criminal teachings then scourged out of them, if it be not too
late to be possible. Probably not fewer than five or six infants per day are born (in

this Christian country) so surrounded by a network of crime as to make escape
from this fearful destiny all but impossible.

< The writer then observed as follows :--The obstinate vitality of this crying evil

impels us to undertake a thorough reconsideration of the conditions of that vitality,
with a view to the discovery of some more vulnerable part than has hitherto been

assailed, or, better still, of some one vital condition that it may be possible to

withdraw altogether.

The command of premises for dwelling, for places of congregation, and for the
warehouses workshops, &c, used by the receivers of stolen goods, the coiners, the
                                  and the thieves' instrument-makers, and, lastly, for the training
illicit distillers,               would undoubtedly appear to be one of the essential conditions                                                                                                                             of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             of

the existence of the predatory class. For had such shelter and harbourage been
heretofore wholly unattainable, it is not too much to say that the class could never
have come into existence. Assuming, then, that the command of adequate pre-
mises is a vital condition, it remains only to consider whether, practically, the
community has power to withdraw such condition, and (having regard to our
Anglo-Saxon dislike to meddlesome or intrusive Governmental interference)
whether the object of depriving the predatory class of the command of the pre-
mises indispensable to their plundering-operations can be accomplished without
having recourse to enactments of an arbitrary and inquisitorial character.
The use of premises is of course obtained by the payment of rent; and as no

 honest owner of house property would willingly receive rents which he knew or

 even suspected to be derived from the plunder of his neighbours, it follows that

 the members of the predatory class can obtain tenancy only from landlords who
 are ignorant of the vocation of their tenants, or from landlords who are not unwill-

 ing to accept the proceeds of crime in payment. But for ignorance or connivance,
 therefore, the predatory class would cease to be able to obtain harbourage, and must

 speedily fall into dispersion.

    As to the conniving landlords, since there is no moral difference between re-

 ceiving the proceeds of stolen property knowingly and receiving the stolen pro-

perty itself, they cannot expect much sympathy, whatever pressure may be put
 upon them to compel them to act as honest men. Enjoying their property under
the shadow of the law, it is intolerable that they shoidd knowingly allow their
property to harbour those who live by breaking the law.

   As regards those landlords whose property is infested by criminals without their
knowledge, such could not have happened had the public mind been so far advanced

upon the subject as to have recognized it as the plain duty of the owners of house

property to refuse tenancy to all persons of doubtful character, i. e. to all who could

not show, beyond all reasonable doubt, that their rents would be paid out of honest
(/ains, and nowise from the proceeds of crime, directly or indirectly. It could not
have happened, even, had the interests of the landlords as a body, in the suppres-
sion of the predatory class, been well understood, since, in the towns at least, the

heavy expenses annually incurred in the repression of crime cannot but fall ulti-

--mately upon the house property seeing that, although the tenants actually dis-

burse the police and county rates, these outgoings are doubtless considered by the
tenant in estimating the rent he can afford, it being immaterial to him whether
he pays more to the rate-collector and less to the landlord, or more to the landlord

and less to the collector. Hence a landlord who allows his property to harbour

criminals is a traitor to the interests of the landlord body, and woidd no doubt
be so stigmatized had the subject undergone that long and earnest discussion
which must have ended in the formation of a strong and healthy public opinion

regarding it.

   Had such public opinion been now existent, nothing further woidd have been

needed than to find the means of restraining the few unscrupulous landlords who,
for the sake of high rents, from whatever tainted source obtained, woidd set public
opinion at defiance. The matter, however, has to be dealt with under existing
conditions. The question therefore is, In what way can the law most readily deal
with house property so as to induce its owners wholly to shut out the thief, his

--aiders and abettors so that the landlord's absolute rule may be, " No honesty, no

house" ? The answer is, that the pressure of the rates now levied for the repression
of crime, viz. the police and county rates, &c, do constitute an ample force adapted

to this purpose, lying ready to our hands, and requiring only to be rightly wielded.
It is but to "put the saddle on the right horse." It is, in truth, simply a question

between the great majority of householders who do not suffer their property to
harbour the plunderers of their neighbours and the small minority who do.

   Now the law, judging between these parties, might justly say to the offending

minority, " But for the shelter you afford the predatory class, that class must be
wholly dispersed, and the heavy burden of its repression thenceforth cease. There-
fore either do as your fellow-landlords do, and so sweep away the burden altoge-
ther, or prepare to take it wholly on your own shoulders justice will not allow

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

that loss to fall upon the whole body, which, but for the laches of a few of its mem-
bers, wovdd be got rid of altogether." To this it may be added that herein justice

and sound policy go hand in hand ; for, of all means of getting rid of a preventible
evil, surely that of making its continuance a source of loss, instead of profit, to those
upon whose will such continuance depends must ever be the most simple and the
most certain.

   There are two modes of proceeding whereby to fix the cost of repression exclu-
sively upon the property concerned in harbouring the predatory class, viz., 1st, that
of directly imposing the amount upon such property, so far as its complicity can
be proved; and 2nd, that of exempting from the necessary rates all properties that
should be shown to be wholly free from such complicity.
                                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                  157

Of these two modes, the latter would be by far the most easy to cany out. For

a direct imposition being undistinguishable from the infliction of a penalty, the

burden of proof would lie upon the parties demanding such imposition, who would

of course have to contend with the falsehood, concealment, evasion, and trickery

of every kind in which the wrong-doer naturally seeks refuge, and but too often

with triumphant success ; whilst the grant of an exemption from the rates woidd,

on the contrary, be the conferring of a privilege, and the burden of proof would of

course then lie upon the claimant for such privilege, who, unless he appeared with a

clear straightforward case, would have no chance of success. Any sign of con-

cealment, evasion, or trickery would at once throw the claimant out of court for

the time.

Those who are practically acquainted with the difficulty of obtaining legal proof

of guilt, in cases in which there is no moral doubt whatever, or none that the per-

son accused, if innocent, could not clear tip at once, will appreciate the advantage

--to the cornniunity of thus turning the tables upon the supporters of the criminals

by whom our towns are infested, and this without any hardship ; for surely those

who have kept their property free from complicity with criminality cannot have

any difficulty in meeting the inquiry whether they have done so or not.

As every grant of exemption would increase the pressure upon those owners who

were unentitled to it, the accumulated weight would soon force them to dispose of

their interests to men who had established such title. By this process our towns

would be soon purified from the predatory class. The whole host of habitual

burglars, garotters, pickpockets, forgers, coiners, thieves' instrument-makers, re-

ceivers of stolon goods, trainers of young thieves, flash-house keepers, &c. &c. &c,

would be dislodged from their dens and hiding-places ; and unless they took to

honest courses (in doing which every hand should be stretched out to help them),

they would find no shelter other than the workhouse or the gaol ; nor, so long as

the principle herein recommended were maintained, could they ever regain their

footing amongst us.

The dislodgnient of so large a number of offenders, and the total cessation of

their criminal gains, would in all probability necessitate the adoption of some

temporary measures to prevent their being driven to desperation. Nor should we

more than once been compelled, by the occim'ence of violent epidemic disease, to

make temporary provision for the shelter and maintenance of portions of our

town population ; and some analogous provision would probably meet the circum-

stances in view. Whatever difficulties might beset the state of transition, they

must, from the nature of things, be but short-lived. The final relief would be both

great and permanent.

It may stimidate our zeal to call to mind that which our forefathers accom-

plished under analogous circumstances. The "sanctuaries" of the seventeenth

century were not more alien to the ruder times of mounted highwaymen than the

existing " thieves' districts " are to our improved civilization. Macaulay has

given us an instructive account of the suppression of that frightful den of crime,

-- --the sanctuary of Whitefriars " Alsatia, as it was called of which Sir Walter

Scott has left us so lively a picture in " The Fortunes of Nigel." Some 800 known

cutthroats, robbers, receivers of stolen goods, brothel-keepers, &c. had herded

together in this "sanctuary " from time out of mind, ever and anon breaking out

for the purpose of murder and robbery, as opportunity offered, or as their needs

became pressing. At length the public patience became fairly exhausted ; men

aroused themselves as from a lethargy ; supineness gave way to alarm and resent-

ment                        the  requisite powers were  obtained  from the Legislature, and at one single

    On the Study of Periodic Commercial Fluctuations. By W. S. Jevosts.

   It is necessary that all commercial fluctuations should be investigated by the

same systematic methods with which we are familiar in complicated physical

sciences, such as meteorology and terrestrial magnetism, Every kind of periodic
--158 report 1862.

fluctuation must be detected and exhibited, not only as a subject of study in itself,

but because we must ascertain and eliminate such periodic variations before we can

correctly exhibit those which are irregular or non-periodic, and of more interest

and importance.

   Tables of the average weekly accounts of the Bank of England from 1845 to
1861, inclusive, having been prepared, it is shown that there are at least three
kinds of periodic fluctuation observable, during the month, the quarter, and the
year. The first two kinds are precisely similar in character, though differing much
in amount, and are due to the payments of dividends or other claims which occur
at the beginning of the quarter and month. Such payments cause a sudden increase
of the note-circulation and of private deposits, a considerable decrease of private
securities, a slight decrease of the bullion, accompanied by a larger but otherwise

similar variation of the loanable capital.

    Eliminating such variations from those of the whole year, there remain certain
interesting variations due to natural causes, as distinguished from the artificial

distinctions of months and quarters. The notes in circulation rise from a minimum
hi January and February to a maximum in the third quarter, and then very rapidly
decrease during November and December.

   Private securities greatly increase, and private deposits decrease, about harvest-
time, while the bullion and loanable capital undergo a continuous decrease.

   These variations are probably due to a great absorption of capital in buying up
the proceeds of the year s industry, which have to be held in stock for consumption
during the succeeding twelve months.

   The bullion and capital, however, have a second maximum in February, and a

subsequent decrease until May.
   It is also shown, from monthly average determinations, that the rate of discount

and the number of bankruptcies suffer a sudden rise after the harvest months. It
may be said that there is a periodic tendency to commercial distress and difficulty
during the months of October and November. The great commercial panics are
aggravations of this periodic difficulty, due to irregular fluctuations.

   Of 79,794 bankruptcies which were gazetted from the beginning of 1806 to the
end of 1860, 28,391 occurred in the second month of the quarter, 26,427 in the
third month, and only 24,976 in the first month, in which occurs the payment of

the public dividends.

   The price of consols and the price of wheat exhibits a double minimum during

the year.

           Notice of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy

                                  By W. S. Jevoxs, M. A.

   1. The main problem of economy may be reduced to a rigorous mathematical

form, and it is only the absence of exact data for the inductive determination of its
laws or functions which will always prevent it from becoming an exact science.

  A2. true theoiy of economy can only be attained by going back to the springs

--of human action the feelings of pleasure and pain which accompany our common

wants, and the satisfaction of those wants by labour exerted to that purpose. These
feelings are the commonest motives of action ; but other motives of a moral or reli-
gious nature must be recognized by the economist as outstanding and disturbing

forces of his problem.

   3. Feelings of pleasure and pain vary in intensity and in duration. They have
two dimensions. The quantity of feeling, therefore, resembles an area, and is got
by integration of the function which expresses the relation of the intensity to the

duration.

   4. Pleasure and pain are opposed as positive and negative quantities.
    5. Anticipation of future pleasure or pain gives a less degree of present feeling,

consumption of successive equal increments of a useful substance does not usually
produce equal increments of pleasure, but tbe ratio of utility on tbe last increment
usually decreases as some function of tbe wbole quantity consumed. Let tbis be

called tbefinal ratio of utility.
   8. Labour is accompanied by pain, and will be exerted botb in intensity and

duration until a further increment will be more painful tban tbe increment of pro-

duce thereby obtained is pleasurable.

   9. Tbe abilities of two men in producing tbe same or of one man in producing

general kinds of useful objects are very various, contrary to tbe erroneous assump-

tion of Ricardo.

   10. When two persons, each possessing a known quantity of a commodity or

useful substance capable of division into small quantities, exchange with each

other, the unknown quantities which pass between them are determined by two
equations, involving the known quantities of commodity previously possessed and

the functions expressing the final ratios of utility of those commodities. It is also

a necessary condition of the exchange that any portions of the commodities, and
therefore the last small portions, are exchanged in the same ratio as the whole

quantities.

   11. Wben there are more than two persons or commodities, a simple law of

combinations gives the numbers of equations which will determine all the quantities
passing in exchange. The whole system of trade, howsoever extensive, is thus

theoretically represented by a system of equations.

   12. When the quantities of commodities are considered as produced by labour

under the conditions stated in (8), a new set of equations will determine, in con-
junction with the equations of excbange, the new set of unknown quantities intro-
duced. Any system of production and trade is thus theoretically represented.

    13. Capital is defined to be simply maintenance of labourers while they are
awaiting the results of labour employed in a manner which does not give immediate

returns. As maintenance may be applied indifferently to any branch of industry,
the interest of all (free) capital is the same. The interest is determined by the
ratio which a new increment of produce bears to the increment of capital by which
it was produced. It is shown to be a simple mathematical result of the above con-

ditions that the interest of capital always tends to fall rapidly as its quantity in

proportion to labour increases.

   14. When the remaining parts of the theory are completed, it will probably be

shown that the rate of wages is the average produce of labour after deduction of
rent, interest, profit, insurance, and taxation. These are so many payments which
the labourer makes for peculiar advantages enjoyed.

        On the Definition and Nature of the Science of Political Economy.
                          By Henry Dunning Macleod, B.A.

   The author said, as the science of political economy was daily growing in im-
portance, and was now made a subject of examination in the public services, its
nature and objects should be settled, as these points had not yet been decided by
economists. Ever since it was founded, its cultivators had declared that it was a
physical science, and that it shoidd be investigated in a manner analogous to that
in which the researches of physical science were conducted. If this were so, it
must obey the well-understood conditions of a physical science. These were tbat
it must be some large body of phenomena all founded on a single idea of the most
general nature. The purpose of the science was to discover the laws of these phe-
nomena. It must also be based upon certain conceptions and axioms which must
be perfectly general. If political economy were therefore a physical science, it
must be some large body of phenomena all based upon a single idea, and it must
be based upon conceptions and axioms of the same wideness and generality as those

of physical science.

   Like many other sciences, political economy had undergone some changes of con-
ception since it was founded. At present there were two definitions which divided

economists. First, that it was the science which treated of the production, distribution,
and consumption of wealth. This definition was first given to it by J. B. Say.
--160 REPORT 1862.

The second was, that it %oas the science of exchanges, or of value, or the philosophy
of commerce. This definition was first" given to it by (Jondillac, who published a

treatise on economic science in 1776, the same year as that in which the ' Wealth
of Nations' was published. This was neglected at first; but, as in so many
other cases in science, Condillac's idea was now rapidly gaining ground, and it
was the one to which the majority of recent economists were now gravitating.

The object of the paper was to consider which was the better definition. The first

requisite of a good definition was that it should be clear and distinct. In the first

definition, production, distribution, consumption, and wealth were wholly unex-

plained. Scarcely two economists were agreed as to what wealth meant, or were

consistent with themselves in its use. All were'agreed, however, that corn, clothes,

&c.,were wealth. The production of corn, clothes, &c, was the production of

wealth. If, therefore, political economy treated of the production of wealth, it

might be supposed that it treated of the business of farming, manufacturing, &c.

But every one knew that economic science had nothing to do with the arts and

processes of fanning, manufacturing, &c. ; it had nothing to do with the arts and

processes by which things were obtained, but only with their price or value when

obtained. 'Production must, therefore, bear some very technical meaning not

apparent at first, and therefore it should not be made part of the definition of the

science. Every lawyer and merchant knew that a debt was a species of property.

The business of banking consisted in buying debts by creating other debts. It was

by no means easy to see how buying debts with debts came under the idea of the

production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.

   The interpretation of wealth was full of perplexity. No man could tell what
Adam Smith meant by wealth. But as economic science treated of wealth, we

must consider what that quality of things is in regard to which they are considered

as wealth, and how they came into the science of wealth ; and that quality being-

settled with regard to any one of them, it must be generalized so as to include all
quantities which possessed that quality. The Abbe" Baudeau had a very instruc-

tive passage, in which he showed that things were wealth solely from being ex-
                                                                                                       when
changeable ;  so  long  as  they  were  exchangeable, they  were  wealth                                     they
                                                                                                    ;

--ceased to be exchangeable, they ceased to be wealth. Here, therefore, was the

general conception of wealth exchangeability. Hence, if political economy

was the sreience of wealth, it must be the science of the exchangeable relations

of quantities. This was now the conception adopted by the majority of modern

economists ; and we at once saw that it answered the conditions of a physical

science. It was a distinct and circumscribed body of phenomena, all based

upon a' single idea. It was a new order of variable quantities, and of course the
theory of the exchangeable relations of quantities must be brought into harmony

with the o-eneral theory of variable quantities. Adopting exchangeability as the
test of wealth, all exchangeable quantities must be included in it. These were of

--three distinct species : (1) material products, (2) what were usually called imma-

terial products, such as the sciences and knowledge, and (3) what was called in-

corporeal property, such as copyright, shares in companies, the fimds, credit, &c.
Exchanges of these kinds of property were constantly taking place, and therefore

that formed the domain of economic science. The nature of the science was indi-
cated by its name, for oiko? was the technical term in Attic law for private property
of all sorts ; and economic science determined the laws which regulated the ex-
changes of property. The foundation of economic science was the right of private
property and exchange, which was opposed to Socialism, where the right of private

property and exchange was abolished. Such a state extinguished all notion of
value, which coidd not exist without an exchange. Production and distribution

tooether constitute exchange. When persons want to have something distributed

to°them, they must produce something to give in exchange, and the reciprocal
production and distribution form an exchange. The whole body of exchanges,
both within the country and with foreign countries, constitute what the majority
of modern economists hold to be the domain of pure economic science.

   This body of phenomena might be brought under the strictest laws of physical
science and all discordances among economists might be decided by the acknow-
ledged laws of inductive logic. It could easily be shown that the modes of investi-

gation current among economists were utterly repugnant to the fundamental prin-

ciples of natural philosophj^.

   It was already implicitly acknowledged that it was a mathematical science. In
any book of Algebra it was said that money was a positive quantity, and debts
negative quantities. Each were exchangeable, and therefore economic quantities.
Here, therefore, were positive economic quantities and negative economic quantities.

Now mathematicians had fully explained the meaning of negative quantities and

the use of the negative sign in the various physical sciences, but no mathema-
tician had explained the meaning of negative economic quantities and the theory
of the negative sign in political economy. Nevertheless it was of the highest im-
portance to do so. Under the simple fact remarked by algebraists that debts were
negative quantities, there lay hid a new and magnificent branch of economical
analysis, which contained the solution of the theory of credit, and all other incor-
poreal property, which constituted at least 95 per cent, of valuable property, which
was wholly omitted from economic works.

   Adopting the conception of exchanges, a great new physical science was pre-
sented to us, fitted to be raised to the rank of an exact science ; for it was found

that the laws of exchange were absolutely the same in all ages and countries.
Economic science could therefore be raised to the rank of an exact science, because

it was based upon principles of human nature as permanent and universal as those of
physical substances upon which the physical sciences were based.

           On the Utility of Colonization. By Herman Merivale.

The author drew a distinction between the benefits of colonization, which for

his purpose he assumed to be admitted, and those of retaining the government of

colonies after they had become settled communities. As to the latter, he observed

Howthat the following was the simplest mode of stating the question.         far is the

profitable application of the accumulated knowledge, capital, and labour of an old

country to the production of wealth in a new country aided by the circumstance

that both are under the same government? But passing over at present the

general problem, he confined himself to a single portion of it, namely, how far the

advantage which we derive from emigration as an outlet to our people might be

affected by any political change involving the loss of our colonial empire.

He then entered on a variety of statistical details to show that the peculiar

advantage of emigration, as now carried on, consisted not only in its extent, but in

the regular manner in which it controlled the progress of popidation. He showed

that since the year 1845, when the potato-disease commenced, the increase of

population in the United Kingdom, taken together, had been scarcely greater than

in France during the same period. In England and Wales however, taken alone,

the natural increase had been about 10 per cent., in France about 4 per cent. only.

And yet, in the same period, England and Wales had probably sent out a million

of emigrants, France none (that is, the immigration into that country nearly

balanced the emigration). In the same period, in England and Wales, the following

--circumstances had coincided : large emigration, increase of the number of births,

increase of the number of marriages, with no diminution in the average length of

life, indicating no diminution in the comfort of the people. Emigration has pro-

vided for about one child in six, and thereby enabled the people of England to

marry as early as before, and to have as many children, without any pressure of our

population indicated by decline in the national well-being. In France, the same

--period exhibited these facts : no emigration, a due relative increase in the number

of marriages, no diminution in the public well-being, as indicated by mortality,
but rather an increase. The inevitable consequence which these facts indicated

was, as the author observed, that there must have been a diminution in the num-
ber of births to a marriage. And this was completely borne out by the facts. The
annual number of births remained absolutely stationary throughout the period.

--The ratio of births to a marriage was continually diminishing (from 1822 to 1831,

3-64 now about 3). Marriages were less productive, either from being contracted

later or from other causes ; and the progress of population was, in our country, in
a more normal and healthy condition, owing to the resource which emigration,

afforded.

   It was, however, obvious that if a foreign country would receive our overflow as
readily and as regularly as a colony, England gained nothing, in this matter of

emigration, by retaining her dominion over the latter. And this had been the case
for very many years. The United States had afforded greater facilities to emigrants

than any or all our colonies, and had attracted them in greater numbers. But the
present state of that republic seems to preclude all reasonable hope of the continu-
ance of those facilities to anything like the same extent. Clearly not, if it sepa-
rated into a number of distracted and indebted communities, with hostile feelings

to each other probably not, even if the union could be restored. He therefore
                                                                   ;

argued the great importance of maintaining our political tie at the present moment

--with those colonies which absorb our emigrants Canada and Australia ; the latter

beginning already to receive so large a number as to show a figure of some im-
portance in our returns. And, without laying too much stress on numerical state-
ments having reference to so short a period as the last two years, he thought there
were already signs of a serious stoppage of emigration in general, and of a com-
parative diversion of that which exists, from the States to the colonies.

On the Training and Instruction of the Unemployed in the Manufacturing

 Districts during the present Crisis. By the Rev. W. N". Moleswoeth, M.A.

   The author of this paper stated that he read it rather with a view of obtaining

suggestions than of imparting information. He then proceeded to give a briet

account of the operations of the Rochdale committee for the instruction of the un-
employed. The object of that committee was to educate the unemployed adults
during a portion of the hours in which, under ordinary circumstances, they would

be at work. The teachers were persons who had volunteered their services from
among the unemployed themselves*, the teaching being in fact very similar to that

of the Sunday schools ; the branches of education taught in the schools were read-
ing, writing, arithmetic, and elementary geography. In addition to this, some
gentlemen in the town had given readings or lectures on various subjects; and on
these occasions the scholars were encouraged to ask questions, and to enter into a
conversational discussion of the topics treated by the lecturer. Of course the in-
struction given in these schools was very imperfect ; still it was appreciated by

the men, who were evidently very grateful for the efforts made for their improve-
ment, and anxious to profit by them. The committee had only just commenced
their operations, and were much cramped by the want of fund's f- They were
gradually feeling their way towards something higher and better, and he was sure

that they would be very thankful for any suggestions that might be contributed
by the eminent educationists present in the Section, in the course of the dis-
cussion which would follow the reading of the paper.

Local Taxation and Real Property. By Feedeeick Pttbdy, F.S.S., Principal
              of the Statistical Department, Poor Law Board, London.

    In the schemes recently brought before the public for the partial or complete

revision of British taxation, none, so far as I am aware, has recognized the claims

 to consideration which the large and constantly increasing revenue raised under

 the designation of " local taxation " possesses.

    The question of our local imposts ought not, in any discussion of the equitable
 re-adjustment of the taxation of the kingdom, to be ignored. Obviously the money
 expended for the relief of the poor, for the formation and the repair of the public
 highways, for the prevention or for the punishment of crime, for the sewerage and
 sanitary regulations of towns, and for the other various objects of public utility,
 for which local taxes are raised, is as necessary to the maintenance of the country in
 its political, social, and economical integrity as the imperial expenditure for the
 Army, the Navy, or the Civil Service.

    The information collected under the powers of the Local Taxation Returns Act

     * Paid masters have since been engaged, the teachers remaining as monitors under
 them, with a payment of Is. each.

     t This would have been amply supplied by means of the Australian grants.

of 1860, and recently published by the Home Office, is supplementary to the

Returns of Local Taxation in England and Wales published by other departments.
Therefore, as regards England, we have at length a complete account of the amounts
raised and expended for local purposes. With respect to Scotland and Ireland the
amounts of two or three of the principal local taxes are officially published, and
the others are approximately known. Hence we obtain a close approximation to
the entire amount of the local taxes of the United Kingdom.

   The majority of these taxes are incident upon real property; the residue falls
upon personal property. This distinction will be observed in the subsequent

classification.

   As regards England and Wales, the figures given hereafter chiefly relate to the

year 1860-61, though in a few instances the returns refer to an earlier date.
   1. The poor's rate is by far the heaviest of our local taxes ; with this rate the

largest portion of the county, borough, and police rates is raised ; but, for the sake
of a clearer classification, these latter rates have been deducted, leaving a total

almost exclusively devoted to the relief of the poor. In 1860-61 this sum was
£5,996,409. This was quite independent of all payments from Her Majesty's

Treasury, and of other receipts in aid of poor's rates.
   2. The amount of county, borough, and police rates paid out of the poor's rate

in the same year was £1,925,210.
   3. In many places the borough rate is levied separately ; in 1854 it amounted

to £311,953.

   4. Highway rates in 1859, inclusive of labour given by parishes in lieu of pay-
ment of rates, amounted to £2,065,841.

   5. Church rates in 1860-61 were returned as £233,560.

    6. Sewers' rate in certain districts, not metropolitan, £35,323.

   7. Drainage and Embankment rates, £65,672.
   8. City of London Commission of Sewers, £21,058.
   9. Rates raised by the Metropolis Local Management Board, £788,189.
   10. Metropolis Main Drainage, £161,017.

    11. Rates raised by Burial Boards, £103,707.
   12. Rates raised by Local Boards, £850,578. These, together with two small sums
for lighting and watching, and for Improvement Commissions, constitute an
aggregate of £12,582,277 leviable on real property.
   The other taxes are

    13. Turnpike tolls (inclusive of parish compositions), which in 1859 amounted to
£1,126,465 ; whence it appears that the cost of the highways and turnpike roads in
England and Wales is nearlv £3,200,000 a year.

    14. Harbours, 1860-61, amounted to £1,201,398 ; and
    15. Trinity House dues, in 1861, to £288,313. These three rates form a total of
£2,616,176, and are incident upon personal property.
   The grand total raised in England and Wales, therefore, as the local taxation
for one year, was £15,198,053.
   As regards Scotland,

    1. Poor's rates in 1860-61, inclusive of £18,159 collected at church doors,

£646,871.
    2. Cost of police in counties and burghs, in 1852, £76,609 prison-rate assess-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

ment in 1860, £36,107. It is believed that there are other items of local taxation,
but they are not easily discovered. The total of these three rates is £741,428, all
incident upon real property.

    3. Turnpike tolls and Highland roads and bridges in 1858-59, inclusive of revenue
from other sources in aid, £233,337.

    4. Northern lights in 1860, £59,747. Total £292,084, falling on personal property.

   The aggregate (and it can only be regarded as an approximate one) is £1,035,512.
   As regards Ireland,

    1. Poor's rate in 1860-61, including the cost under the Medical Charities Act,
£689,229.

    2. Grand jury presentments in 1860, amounting to £1,034,927. These present-
ments, it should be observed, defray charges similar to those provided for by the
countv and borough rates of England.

                                                                                                      11*
161 REPORT--1862.

   3. Dublin police in 1852, £38,324. Total £1,732,480, falling upon real property.
This, like the similar charge for Scotland, must be considered as a close approxima-

tion only.

   4. Dublin Ballast Board in 1830, £46,658. This charge falls upon personal

property.

   The grand totalfor Ireland is £1,779,138.
   Gathering the totals together for the three kingdoms, we are presented with the
following summary :

   Hence it appears that the real property of the United Kingdom pays the
large sum of £15,056,000 for local taxation, before it comes under the hand'of the
collector of imperial taxes. The amount of imperial taxation which this descrip-

tion of property has to bear can only be given roughly, because some of the items
clearly chargeable thereto cannot be eliminated from the general mass. These
imposts are, however, so far as known or capable of estimate, as follows :

                    Land Tax                                £
                    House Duty
                    Succession Duty                     1,145,341
                    Stamps on Deeds (say one-half) .      822,936
                                                          005,196
                    Fire Insurance (say one-half) ....    064,000
                                                          742,000
                    Property Tax
                                                        5,472,281

                                                        £9,451,754

Therefore the amount of taxation, local and imperial, paid out of real property

is £24,508,000. The annual value of real property, assessable under head Schedule

A, was in 1861, in

                                                        £

                                         £131,680,497

From the foregoing statistics it appears that the rate in the pound on real pro-

On the Pauperism and Mortality of Lancashire. By Frederick Purdy, F.S.S.,
            Principal of the Statistical Department, Poor Law Board.

   1. To bring under the notice of the Section some of the statistical data which
represent the pauperism and mortality during the six months ended at Midsummer

last, in the cotton districts of Lancashire and Cheshire, is the object of the present

commimication. No attempt has been made in it to explicate those involved and

complex causes which find their most significant numerical exponents in the mor-

tality tables of the Registrar-General. The distress which has fallen upon the

operatives of the cotton districts has not ceased, but is apparently deepening as the

winter approaches. It would be futile to attempt anything like a satisfactory

analysis of the phenomena before they cease, and while we are, therefore, neces-
sarily ignorant of* the extent and character of their ultimate development. Beyond

this, it is essential to a scientific elucidation of the connexion which exists between

distress and mortality in any place that the investigator possess both hygienic and

--local knowledge of the district under review qualifications usually looked for in

active and intelligent local officers of health. Though the writer can throw no

light, by the aid of those qualifications, upon the facts hereafter noticed, he hopes

that at the present time the important social questions which are involved in these

statistics will constitute a sufficient claim, upon the attention of the Section.
   2. It is too well known that when the labouring classes suffer from a collapse in

trade or manufactures, the immediate effects upon very considerable numbers are
a deprivation of the comforts and a diminution of the necessaries of life, with
increased sickness and mortality following in the wake. Then pauperism emerges

among families where, in prosperous times, it was never known, and becomes,

under ordinary circumstances, not only the index, but the measure of distress.

Pauperism, though it may indicate, ceases to measure distress when thousands are

thrown out of their usual employment by the paralysis of a vast industry like the

cotton trade of Lancashire. The lower and less thrifty class of operatives soon

come upon the rates ; the more provident and respectable families, after exhausting
their means, keep off the rates till the last moment, or eke out their means by the
aid of private charity, and so contrive for a time to avoid the pauper-roll. The
distress, or rather the destitution, would be accurately measured if we knew the
numbers aided by private charity, in addition to those who are relieved from the

tioor-rates. This, however, does not contemplate the deprivations which those

 abourers, who have honourably striven to live independently of charity, undergo
in every form, before they reach that point where all their own resources are

exhausted.

3. Lancashire, during the last fifteen years, has been thrice visited with distress.

In the year 1846-7 the expenditure for the relief to the poor throughout the
country rose over the average of the three preceding years by £261,363, or by 83

per cent. At the same time the deaths in the year increased over the average of
the three previous years by 18,181, or 36 per cent. In the autumn of 1857 the
district was suffering from the effects of what was frequently termed the " Ameri-
can crisis;" and the distress continued to the midsummer following. The distress,

as measured by the increase of pauperism, can, in respect of this period, be exhi-
bited for the twenty-one unions of Lancashire and Cheshire, which contain the

principal cotton manufacturing population of the kingdom. During the nine

months ended at Midsummer 1858, the deaths in those unions rose 119 per cent.

The numbers for each quarter are stated below, viz. :

                             Quarters ended 1856-7.    Quarters ended 1857-8.

            December         12,667                    15,131

            March            14,302                    15,603

166 eepokt--1862.

   Taking the amount of pauperism at the end of each quarter in the same unions as
sufficiently exhibiting the pressure, it will be found that the increase in 1858 was
35 -4 per cent.

   The number of paupers at the end of each quarter was as follows :

   4. The third visitation is that under which the cotton manufacturing districts of
Lancashire and Cheshire are now suffering, with every symptom of further aggrava-
tion. In the twenty-one unions, inclusive of Liverpool, which comprise, as already

stated, the cotton manufacturing district of Lancashire and Cheshire, the number
of deaths in the four March quarters last past stood thus :

It will be seen hereafter that the pauperism greatly increased in the June quarter

of the present year, though the augmentation in the ratio of deaths, as here shown,

considerably d imin ished. But the milder weather of the Midsummerquarter maybe

credited with some, if not the whole, of the difference in the mortality. The aggre-

gate population of these imions in 1861 was 2,067,267. No attempt has here been

made to adjust the census returns in respect of prior or posterior dates. Whenever

any ratio in this paper is given in relation to the population, it has been com-

puted upon the actual census of 1861. The number of paupers in receipt of relief,

excluding from the account lunatics in asylums and vagrants, stood in the four

March quarters as hereafter stated :--1859, 66,704 ; 1860,57,933; 1861, 58,261;

average, 60,966 ;  1862, 100,813                                                                   being an increase of 39,847, or 65-3 per cent.        The
                                                                                                ;

number of paupers in the four June quarters was, in 1859, 61,002; 1860, 54,149;

1861, 54,731 ; average, 56,627 ; 1862, 107,420, being an increase of 50,793, or 897

per cent. The rate at which the pauperism rose to its present amount has varied

considerably in the different unions of the district.

5. The unions have been divided into three sections, for the purpose of ascer-

taining what immediate relation the pauperism bears to the mortality. The first,

or section A, comprises seven unions, with a population of 773,662 persons. In no

union of this section had the number of paupers at Midsummer 1862 been more

than 100 per cent, in excess, when compared with the numbers relieved at Mid-

summer 1861. Measuring the ratio of pauperism on the population, we find that

at Christmas 1861, when the pressure first became marked, it was 2-7 per cent., or

0-5 per cent, higher than at Christmas 1860. From Christmas to Midsummer last

it rose 0-8 per cent. ; at the latter date it was 3-5 per cent. In the following table

the unions are placed according to their pauperism at the end of 1861. The absolute

increase per cent, in the number of paupers at Midsummer 1862, as compared with

Midsummer 1861, is shown in the last column :

   Section B. comprises five unions with a population of 442,644 persons. In this

section the absolute increase in the number of paupers at Midsummer last was over
100, and under 150 per cent. The proportionate pauperism at Christmas 1861 was
3-6 per cent., or 1-2 more than at the previous Christmas. During the half-year
ended with Midsummer last, it rose 2 per cent. ; therefore at the latter date it was

5-6 per cent.

   Section C. contains four unions, with an aggregate population of 459,547 persons.

In this group the absolute pauperism at Midsummer last was in excess of that of
Midsummer 1861 by 150 per cent, and upwards. The proportionate pauperism at
Christmas 1861 was 37 per cent, on the population, or 17 per cent, more than at
the corresponding season of 1860. During the Midsummer half-year of 1862 the
pauperism rose 4-9 per cent. ; consequently at the end of June last it was 8-6 per

cent. This is by far the most pauperized section of the three.

6. The pauperism of a union is correctly expressed by the ratio which the num-

ber receiving relief from the poor-rates bears to the population of the place. The

rate of absolute increase in the number of paupers measures^ more directly the

pressure upon the relief-lists, due to the suspension or diminution of the ordinary

industrial occupations of a district. For example, the increase in the Ashton-under-

Lyne union at Midsummer was 458 per cent., and in the Preston union 283 per

cent. But the pauperism of the Preston union was much greater than that of

Ashton, being in the former place 11-0 per cent, on the population, and in the

latter 7'1 per cent. only. Preston started from a point considerably higher than

Ashton, but proceeded with less rapid strides. In Ashton-under-Lyne the converse

process took place : similar remarks are respectively applicable to other unions of

the cotton manufacturing districts.

   7. Three tables have been framed to exhibit the rise of pauperism in the se-
lected unions during the two first quarters of the present year. The first column
of ratios in each table shows the percentage of paupers in the last week of Decem-

ber 1860, taken upon the population of 1861, that census being employed as nearer
to the truth than any mere estimate. The next column gives the ratios for De-

cember 1861. By a comparison of the two, the proportion of pressure in each
168 report--1862.

union at the close of the last year is shown. The other columns exhibit the ratio

at the end of each of the six months ended with June 1860 and 1861. By these

means the amount and the velocity of the increase are both traceable. In the seven

unions of Table I. *, the ratio per cent, of paupers to population in the last week of

1860 was 2-2; in the last week of 1861 it was 2-7. By the last week of March in
the current year it had risen to 3-3, or 0-6 in the three months. By June it was 35,

or 2- per cent. more.

    8. This section exhibits the least increase in the pauperism of the district, and that
increase took place gradually. Consulting the Registrar-General's quarterly reports

of mortality, we find, on comparing the March quarter 1862 with the average of
the corresponding quarters of the three previous years, that there was an increase
of 604 deaths, or 118 per cent., and in the June quarter 354 deaths, or 7-9 per cent.
It will be noted from the account which follows that the rate of mortality has not

any apparent relation to the increase of pauperism in these unions. In Bury, one
of the least pauperized of the group, the increase of mortality was very great. In
Macclesfield, the most pauperized of this section, there was a positive decrease.

   The unions of Salford, Bury, and Oldham experienced the highest mortality.

Comparing the deaths in the Salford union in the March and June quarters of 1862
with the numbers returned for the corresponding quarters of 1861, it will be found
that the increase was 186 and 157 respectively, or 29-4 and 28-3 per cent. The rate
at which the pauperism of any locality has been recruited, rather than the height
to which it has attained, gives a more correct notion of the distress and consequent
suffering. To this end the unions in the next statement are classed according to

the rate of increase of pauperism as measured on every 100 of the population. The
union marked by the highest rate of increase between December 1861 and Mid-
summer 1862 is placed first. Against each union the percentage increase or de-

crease of mortality is placed, in respect of the half-year ended with June last, and
compared with the average of the three previous Midsummer half-years.

   9. In the five unions of Table II. the ratio of paupers at the end of 1860 was 2-4

per cent. ; at the end of 1861 it was 3-6 By the last week of March 1862 it had
risen to 5-0, or T4 per cent, in the three months. In June it was 5-6, or 06 per cent,

increase in that quarter. Here similar diversities in the rate of mortality are ob-

servable. In the Burnley union, where the pauperism is moderate, and in Man-

chester, where it is high, the increase in the rate of mortality is very great, and

nearly equal.

   If we compare the number of deaths in Manchester in the March quarter of 1862
with those of the corresponding quarter of 1861, we find the enormous increase of

539, or 30-4 per cent. ; but in the subsequent quarter, upon instituting a similar
comparison, though an increase still appears, it is far below that of the previous
three months. In the June quarter the increase was 112, or 7 -2 per cent.

   Again, ranging the unions according to the rate of increase in the Midsummer
six months, compared with the mean of the corresponding half-years of 1859-60
and 1861, we have the subsequent list :

10. In the four unions of Table III. the ratio of pauperism in the last week of

December 1860 was 20 per cent.; in the corresponding week of 1861 it was 37

per cent. At the end of the three subsequent months it had attained to 68 per

cent.; by Midsummer 1862 it was 8'6 per cent. The pauperism had risen 49 per

cent, in the half-year. This is by far the most pauperized section of the district.

As regards mortality, the Preston union, the most pauperized of this section, ap-

pears to have suffered little                                                                                                   the  same observation  is  applicable  to the Ashton-under-

   11. Liverpool has not been classed with the other places in the foregoing tables

because, however much that port may have suffered in consequence of the so-called

"cotton famine," it evidently stands in a very different category from the manufac-
turing unions of Lancashire. It has suffered some increase in pauperism, though,

in comparison with the other parts of the district, the augmentation may be called
very moderate. The contiguous union of West Derby and the large parish of

Toxteth Park are so intimately connected with Liverpool, that it is undesirable, in
discussing the mortality and pauperism, to regard the latter town separately,

though neither of its suburbs appears to have been much effected by the present

distress. It is remarkable that while Liverpool exhibits an increase of pauperism

fivefold that of the West Derby union (including Toxteth Park), the increase of

mortality in the latter place is very considerable ; on the other hand, in the former
town there is a positive, though small, decrease in the number of deaths :

  12. An interval of three years lies between the commencement of the last and the

rise of the present distress in the north. The distress of 1857-8 barely extended
over nine months. Counting to Midsummer last, the present suspension of occu-

pations has continued, with increasing severity, for eight months. It will be of
interest to contrast the results of the two periods, premising that the figures which

relate to 1857-8 are representative of the nine months terminated at Midsummer
1858, while those of 1862 are for six months only. The ratio of pauperism for the
earlier period is the average of the numbers relieved at Christmas, Lady-day, and
Midsummer ; in the latter year it is the average taken in respect of Lady-day and
Midsummer. The unions are hereafter classed according to the parity or the dis-
parity of the results at the two periods. 1. Three unions which exhibit cor-
responding results. 2. Six unions which show in comparison with earlier ratios a
diminished rate of increase. 3. Six unions which show in comparison with the
earlier ratios an augmented rate of increase :

Making the same contrasts between Liverpool and the West Derby Union, we

have the following figures :

                                  Difference per cent.                           Difference per cent.

   13. It is satisfactory to know that, whatever may be the cause, the rate of

mortality in the distressed unions is, in proportion to the suffering, as indicated by

the pauper returns, less now than it was in 1857-8. The Table just given shows
that, with one or two exceptions, the pressure upon the poor-rates is much severer
now than then ; and that, of the sixteen unions selected as the most important of
the district, three show the same rate of increase in mortality as in 1857-58, seven
show a less rate of increase in mortality than in 1857-58, six show a greater rate of

increase of mortality than in 1857-58. But the pauperism of the last six is, in its

excess, nearly double that attained in the earlier period.
    14. It is evident, from an inspection of the notes appended to the registrar's

quarterly returns, that during the nine months ended with June 1858, an epidemic

of scarlatina, whooping-cough, small-pox, and measles prevailed in the district
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                       171

throughout the period, with more or less violence : to these causes must be added
many deaths from bronchitis and pneumonia. The registrar of the Hulme district,

with reference to the great mortality there in the March quarter of 1858, remarks
that a the operative classes have been compelled to economise their resources in

every possible way. This has led to an excessive overcrowding of the dwelling-

houses amongst the poorer classes ; for where in some streets most part of the houses

are uninhabited, in others there are as many as two and often three families in one

house, badly ventilated and deficient in most sanitary requirements. To this I

mainly attribute the increased mortality." It will be remembered, in connexion

with the existing distress, that the deaths in the Macclesfield imion are below the
average. The registrar for the east district states that " very extensive sanitary

improvements have been made in sewering and in paving streets and courts in the
worst parts of the borough; and the cottages have been also much improved.

"Where these measures have been carried out the deaths have decreased. The
registrar of Wigan remarks, in regard to the June quarter, that " the deaths are

very much below the average for the last five years." He observes that "distress

prevails greatly, and is on the increase;" but that, to some extent, it has been

mitigated by liberal subscriptions. The registrar of Walton-le-dale district, in the
Preston union, states that there the " deaths are much below the average, which I

think is accounted for by the almost total stoppage of the cotton-mills, the inha-

bitants of the Walton district being chiefly factory operatives  It may

seem in some degree to account for the improvement in health amidst such distress

if I add that the able-bodied poor in my district are employed in out-door labour."
The registrar of Preston remarks that " There are now upwards of 22,000 people

out of employment, and entirely dependent on charity of the boards of guardians

for support  But it is gratifying to know that, notwithstanding so much

poverty, the rate of mortality has not increased, but decreased." The Registrar-

General has made the following remark as to the sanitary condition of the north-

--western district, which comprises the union counties of Lancaster and Chester,

during the quarter ended at June last : " It was noticed above that the depression

of trade in the manufacturing district had sensibly affected the marriage returns

but happily it does not appear that the same cause acting in the opposite direction

has tended materially to raise the rate of mortality, and it cannot positively be

asserted that it has produced that effect in any degree. England, as has already

been mentioned, was generally rather healthier last quarter than in the same season

of 1861 ; but the rate of mortality in Cheshire and Lancashire was, though in an

inconsiderable degree, higher last quarter than it had been in the spring of the
previous year. The difference was only between 2-408 and 2*417 ; " that is to say,
an increase of nine in every 10,000 deaths. With respect to the increased mor-
tality in Lancashire and Cheshire which the returns for the March quarter of the
present year reveal, the Registrar-General had previously observed that " The

registrars in certain districts refer the increased mortality, which these figures too

plainly reveal, to scarlatina, measles, bronchitis, and pneumonia, which had been

prevalent; and by some of them an opinion, which there is reason to fear may be

too well founded, appears to be entertained that those complaints had found an

active ally in the poverty and want which many of the unemployed thousands now

suffer in the great seats of manufacture. Facts have been adduced to prove that

in instances of great depression of trade, like that which recently occurred in

Coventry, the mortality of children is reduced in consequence of the due amount of

maternal care being bestowed on them which in more prosperous times is with-

drawn by the important requisition of factory labour. This is within limits.
Nursing, in straitened circumstances, may be better for children than fulness of
good cheer without it ; but when hard times are prolonged, and the small store
that had been gathered in the day of full work is exhausted, the greatest amount of

parental attention will not expel physical decline, sickness, or death itself from the

dwelling."

15. To whatever causes those marked diversities which the paper has shown to

exist in the Lancashire and Cheshire imions between the pauperism and the death-

rate during the present distress may be ultimately traced, it will be conceded that

the mortality tables of that district are matters of the deepest import to boards of
172  .                                                                    --report 1862.

guardians and relief committees. It appears obvious to the writer that if the death-

rate in the distressed unions does not permanently exceed, or positively falls below,

that of prosperous times, the relief granted to the unemployed operatives and their
Afamilies is sufficient to maintain them in health.
                                                                                                          greatly increased death-rate,

on the other hand, must, though it be neither directly nor indirectly the result of

insufficient aid, be a source of no little anxiety to those who are now officially or

voluntarily engaged in alleviating the wants of the poor. Rochdale, for example,

can give little concern to its guardians just now on the score of mortality. But

Bury and Salford would in the same matter justify a considerable amount.

Statistics showing the Increased Circulation of a Pure and Instructive Lite-
   rature adapted to the Capacities and the Means of the Labouring Popula-

   tion. By Hexey Hoberts, F.8.A.

   The author of this paper, alluding to the progress of sanitary amelioration, and to
his " Notes on various Efforts to Improve the Domiciliary Condition of the Labour-

ing Classes,'' given in extenso in the Transactions for 18(50, assumed that, in an en-

lightened seat of learning, the efforts made to promote a healthy state of the mind,

and of the immortal part of man, would be deemed equally worthy of attention.

With the progress of popular education in this country, and the unrestricted

liberty of circulating works of every description, excepting such as openly outrage

morality, the desire of gain led to the production of a large amount of low litera-

ture, most objectionable in its character, tending to foster the worst passions of

human nature, and stimulating to the commission of crime, as well as to the con-

tempt of all laws, human and divine. In order to counteract an evil so insidious,

and one productive of so poisonous a state of the moral atmosphere, it was found

worse than useless to have recourse to the law, excepting in a very few instances

of its notorious violation. But much greater success lias resulted from the various

efforts made to supplant and drive out of the field the most injurious of the pub-

lications in question, by the introduction of such as are calculated to create a

healthy moral atmosphere, to cultivate the mind, inform the judgment, to improve

and elevate the taste.

  A notice of the efforts made for promoting this object must, on the present occa-

sion, be necessarily restricted to those of leading societies, some of which, as their

titles indicate, were formed originally for the exclusive circulation of strictly reli-

gious publications, but now combine with that object a more extensive range of

pure and instructive literature. These societies will be referred to in the order of
their establishment ; and afterwards some statistics will be given to show the ex-

tent of the circulation of works of the same class by private publishers, which are

only illustrative of what is now done for this object, though perhaps on a less ex-
tended scale, by many other publishers in the United Kingdom.

   The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge was founded in 1698, by mem-

bers of the Established Church. It has three distinct objects, one of them being

the preparation and circulation of books and tracts, including the Sacred Scriptures
and Prayer-books, in various languages ; and from this source our army and navy

have been largely supplied. The supply of emigrants and the system of lending-

libraries has been long a valuable branch of the society's operations, and, with a

special view to the latter object, its publications now embrace works on history,
biography, philosophy, political economy, natural history, topography, &c, pre-
pared in an attractive form, and written in a Christian spirit. The outlay on the

society's publications has averaged, for the last twenty-five years, about £16,000

per annum. Its issues in the year 1860 to 1861 were, of Bibles and New Testa-

ments, 235,592                                                            Common Prayer Books, 339,997 ;  bound books, 1,952,873 ;  tracts,

&c, 4,105,611 ; total of publications in the year, 6,634,073 : and from the year

1733, when its issues were first reported, it has circulated 148,902,287 copies of

various publications.

   The Book Society for Promoting Religious Knowledge among the Poor was esta-
blished in 1750. It's objects are the gratuitous distribution and the sale of Bibles,

Testaments, and books of established excellence, not exclusively religious, as well

as the publication of original and standard works adapted to promote religious and

moral instruction. It is a rule of this society that no books of a controversial cha-

racter shall be distributed ; and any profits made from the sale of its publications

are appropriated to the making grants of books to destitute Sunday and Ragged

Schools, &c. The receipts and expenditure of the society for the last year were

nearly £5000.

   The Religious Tract and Book Society of Scotland, instituted in 1793, sells none
but religious books. It was the first society in Great Britain to employ colporteurs

in the distribution of approved publications, and it has now from 110 to 120 agents

copies, and of Bibles and Testaments 20,000 copies.

The Religious Tract Society was founded in 1709, at which period it has been

estimated that there were 20,000 hawkers engaged in selling indecent songs and

polluting penny papers throughout all parts of the countiy. The publication of

tracts and Dooks for children, with attractive illustrations, was commenced by thi3

society at an early period of its history; and they were followed by cheap editions

of old authors, or original works, written in a plain and popular style, to which

were subsequently added educational works ; and lastly, it was deemed advisable

to engage in the production of periodical literature, mostly illustrated, and suited

to various ages and classes. Its circulation has increased since 1851 at the rate of

nearly two millions per annum, it having amounted in 1851 to 20,887,064, in 1856
to 31*529,185, and in 1861 to 41,883,921. The agency for distributing this mass of

good literature is all voluntary, excepting that employed on board of emigrant ships
and the sales made through the ordinary channels of trade. The annual receipts

and expenditure of the society now exceed £100,000 ; and the total distribution of

its publications has been about 950,000,000 copies.

The British and Foreign Bible Society was established in 1804, for the supply and

circulation of the Sacred Scriptures without note or comment. In Great Britain

voluntary agency is thus largely employed through the medium of its auxiliaries

and branches; and in foreign countries it promotes the same object, often where
the Scriptures were before unknown, and even amongst savages, where no
written language previously existed. The translating, printing, and distributing

of the Sacred Scriptures, in whole or in part, has been promoted by this society,

directly or indirectly, in 160 languages or dialects ; and the number of versions,

wholly or partially completed, is 190, of which 140 are translations never before
printed. The issues by the society last year were upwards of 1,500,000 copies, and

its total issues of the Scriptures, or portions of them, now amount to 40,910,474
copies. The total receipts of this society were for the past year £168,443 15s. 5d.,

including £76,760 17s. 8d, for the sale of the Scriptures ; and the total expendi-

ture of the society, from its establishment in 1804, has been £5,250,546 13s. Qd.
   The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (now dormant) was established

in 1826. Amongst its earliest publications was the ' Penny Magazine,' which had

at one time a circulation of 200,000 copies. In 1828 it commenced the ' British
Almanac,' a publication which has greatly conduced to the very marked improve-
ment in the general character of our almanacs. The first number of the ' Penny

Cyclopaedia' was issued by this society in 1833, and of its first volume 55,000 copies
were sold.

   The Working Mens Educational Union was founded in 1852, for the purpose of

" assisting all persons desirous of imparting interesting and popular literary and
scientific information imbued with a sound Christian spirit," whether by the de-
livery of lectures, the formation of libraries, or the promotion of mutual-instruction
or other classes for adults. The agency of this society is to a very considerable
extent gratuitous, and the lectures are mostly delivered in such suitable places as

are obtainable free of cost.

   From the Dublin Tract Repository there have been issued within the past ei^ht

years 34,000,000 of publications, including pamphlets and small books.

The Pure Literature Society was established in 1855, for promoting the extensive

circulation of all such books, maps, prints, diagrams, and other publications as may

be deemed good and useful by the managing committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 but the society itself ab-

   Hawking or Colportage of carefully selected books and prints was systematically
commenced in England in 1851, and within the last ten years much has been done
in this way to promote the circulation of pure literature in the rural districts.
Sixty-two local associations have been organized, and are united with the " Church
of England Book-hawking Union," which employs about eighty book-hawkers,
whose aggregate sale is now about £16,000 per annum.

   Another society, designated the British Colportage Association, was established
in 1860, with a view of carrying out the same object by agents not restricted to the

sale of books and educational appliances, but who are expected to act also in a cer-

tain sense as missionaries.

   The numerous publications specially used for instruction in the Schools of the
Poor are mostly issued by one or other of the school societies, and no accurate
estimate as to their numbers can be given. ·

  A class of publications intended to impart a general knowledge of Sanitary

Science, in its application to every-day life, has been lately introduced, and now

forms an important branch of the instruction conveyed to the labouring-classes
through the various agencies under review. The production and circulation of
such publications is a main object of the Ladies1 Sanitary Association, which has,
since its establishment in 1857, distributed 468,500 copies of small works, sold
mostly at from Id. to 2d. each. The issue of sanitary publications was commenced

by Messrs. Jarrold & Sons about ten years since, under the designation of " House-

hold Tracts," which are sold at 2d. each, and of these the number issued up to
June last was 1,345,000. Of another class, entitled " Science for the Household,"
125,000 copies have been circulated.

    Publications promotive of temperance are circulated very extensively from the

establishment of Mr. Tweedie, 337 Strand, and many other booksellers. One
journal devoted to this cause has a circulation of 25,000 copies weekly. The
' British Workman,' issued at Id., and the ' Band of Hope Review,' at %d. have
now a circulation of about 250,000 copies each, with a well-merited increase.

   From Mr. Peter Drummond's Tract and Book Depot, at Stirling, N. B., have

been issued since 1848, gratuitously and by sale, 33,600,000 tracts of 1 to 12 pages

 each.

    Another publishing firm, that of Mr. John Cassell, issues from 25,000,000
 to 30,000,000 annually of well-written penny publications, besides the ' Popular
 Educator,' the ' Blustrated History of England,' and the ' Illustrated Family Bible,'
 in weekly penny numbers, of which, up to the present time, 21,000,000 numbers
 have been printed.

    To this greatly increased circulation of a pure and instructive cheap literature,
 and particularly to the extensive distribution of the Sacred Scriptures, the author
 feels justified in attributing, in no small degree, the striking change in the conduct
 of our manufacturing operatives, at the present time of severe privation and suffer-
 ing, as compared with their riotous proceedings in days not very remote from the
 present ; and he would trust that their conduct may prove instructive to some
 in other countries, who, exalted in authority, and knowing not the value of moral
 influence in governing a people, fetter the bunian mind, and incarcerate those who,
 having themselves experienced that the ways of true wisdom are pleasant, and
 her paths peace, would lead others to walk therein.

 A Statistical Inquiry into the Prevalence of numerous Conditions affecting tht

    Constitution in 1000 Consumptive Persons. By Edward Smith, M.D.,LL.B.,

      F.R.S., Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Consumption at Brompton, Sfc.

     The inquiry was made upon 600 male and 400 female patients at the Hospital
  for Consumption, Brompton, and was intended to show the influence of all the
  causes which are believed to modify the health.

     The average age of the patients was 28-8 years. 30 per cent, had been born in
  London, 36 per cent, had lived chiefly in London, and 53 per cent, had lived in
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  175

London during the preceding 3 years. 8-8 per cent, could not read or write ; and

--only 14-3 per cent, had been insufficiently nourished.
   1. Parental conditions. 54 per cent, had lost the father, 46 per cent, the mother,
and 28 per cent, both parents ; in 25 per cent, only were both parents living. The
average age of the parents at death was 50-8 years, with an increased duration of
4-7 years on the part of the fathers. The most frequent age at death was 35 to 55
years, whilst only 11 per cent, died under the age of 35, and some lived upwards
of 95 years. 18 per cent, had experienced feeble health before the birth of the
patient, and 34 per cent, throughout life ; in 22-7 per cent, one or both parents had
led unsteady lives. 21\L per cent, of the parents had died of consumption, whilst
in 2-8 per cent, the grand-parents, 23-3 per cent, the brothers or sisters, and 9-1 per
cent, the uncles or aunts had died of the same disease. They had suffered from
rheumatism in 22 per cent., from asthma in 9-4 per cent., from liver-disease and
gout in 9 and 7 -2 per cent., and from fevers, ague, insanity, and diabetes in 4 to 5
per cent. Presumed scrofulous affections were extremely rare. In only 6 cases was

there consanguinity of the parents.

   The age of the parents at the birth of the patients was, in half of the cases, from
25 years to 35 years, and in only 2 per cent, was it less than 20 years. The number
of the children was very large, viz. an average of 7*5 to a family, and in some families
there were 23 children. The patient was the first child in 20 per cent., and the

first, second, and third child in half of all the cases. 40 per cent, of the parents'

--children had died.
    2. Personal Conditions. In only 23 per cent, were the patients under set. 20, and
a few were set. 60. 24 per cent, had been feeble at birth, whilst 22 per cent, had
suffered from feeble general health, and 17 per cent, from generally defective appe-
tite. In 12-6 per cent, the lungs had been always delicate ; 2 -5 per cent, had been
dry-nursed ; 25 -4 per cent, had perspired with unusual freedom ; 25 per cent, had
never worn flannel next the skin, and 55 per cent, had suffered from coldness of the

extremities; 72-5 per cent, had an excitable temperament; 621 per cent, had
medium brown or light-coloured hair, 74 per cent, had grey or blue eyes, 60 per

 cent, had florid complexion, and 46-7 per cent, had a fleshy habit.
    16, 65-4, 60, and 41 per cent, had not had measles, scarlet fever, small pox, and

 hooping-cough in their order, and the frequency of any long-continued ill-effects
 from these diseases was insignificant ; 12*8 per cent, had suffered from enlarged
 glands, and 4-5 per cent, from long-continued affection of the eyes, but otherwise

 the ordinary scrofulous disease scarcely existed. 167 per cent, had suffered from
 inflammation of the lungs, and 14-8 per cent, from rheumatism, whilst typhus fever
 and frequent diarrhoea had occurred in 8 per cent., ague in 56 per cent., and liver-

  disease in 4'3 per cent, of the cases.

    The menses appeared at set. 14 and 15 years in 36-4 per cent., and in 11 per cent,
 only was it before 83 1. 13. 43 -5 per cent, were married, and of these 13 per cent, had
 not borne children. Their average age at the birth of the first child was set. 20 to
 25, and in only 9 per cent, were they under set. 20. The number of children per
 family was 1 and 2 in 44 per cent., and 1, 2, and 3 in 55 per cent. ; 38 per cent.
 of the children had died, and in 43 per cent, the general state of the health of the

 children was bad ; abortions had occurred in 46-2 per cent, of the child-bearing

 married women.
     29-6 per cent, of the males had led a bad life at some period, 24-5 per cent, had

  smoked tobacco, 19 -3 per cent, of both sexes had submitted to late hours, and 22-2
 per cent, had suffered much anxiety. In 70 per cent, some complaint was made as
  to the injurious influence of their occupations, as exposure, long hours, close and

  hot rooms, bending posture, dust, or fumes, &c.

     The author then entered into a consideration of the question of hereditary trans-

  mission, and showed the relation of such an inquiry to the purposes of life assur-
  ance ; but was of opinion, that as consumptives are a very mixed class of persons,
  and the causes of the disease most various, the only safeguard to life-offices was the

  careful examination of the chest of applicants by competent physicians.

                  On the Income Tax. By W. T. Thornton.

The object of this paper was to show, first, that every income-tax whatsoever must
176 report--1862.

necessarily violate the just principles of taxation; and, secondly, that "a uniform

income-tax does so to a greater extent than there is any necessity for. Taking as

the principles of taxation those laid down as such by Adam Smith, and adopted

by Ricardo and John Stuart Mill, the writer undertook to prove that the least ob-

i'ectionable income-tax must needs infringe three of Adam Smith's four maxims.

nstead of being levied at the time and in the manner most convenient to the con-

tributor, an income-tax is levied at the most inconvenient time and in the most
Aoffensive manner.
                                                                         man pays his customs or excise dues a little at a time, and
--chooses his own time for paying, never, of course, volunteering to pay, except

when he has wherewithal to pay. But the income-tax comes upon him both all

at once and just at the very time when he is beset with his half-yearly bills, levy-

ing a pitiless percentage on his means of meeting them. It lays him, too, on the

rack, endeavours to extort a confession from him, and leaves him no alternative but

to criminate or to perjure himself. Then, the income-tax is levied most unequally.

It is assessed, not, as Adam Smith says it should be, in proportion to a man's
ability, but in proportion to his honesty. An income-tax must often be, to a certain

extent, a matter of conscience. Those who have no conscience may partially evade

it by lying                                                    and thus  it  acts  as a bounty upon lying,                 and a tax upon  truth.                  The
                                                            ;

honest  man                                                    bears  the full  burden                                     the dishonest goes comparatively free.  This is
                                                                                                                        ;

a vice inherent in and inseparable from every income-tax whatsoever. There must

always be this to counterbalance any virtues it may possess. True, it has the merit

of raising a revenue more effectually than any other expedient, but at what cost

does it do so ? The mere pecuniary cost of its collection may perhaps be moderate

as compared with that of the customs or excise, but money is not the sole element
of cost. The income-tax is collected at the expense of the national honesty. It

offers a powerful temptation to every commercial and every professional man to tell

one deliberate falsehood, to commit one gross act of fraud, every year, and it is
certain that a large majority of commercial and professional men yield to the

temptation ; for, from the last returns, it appears that there are, in Great Britain,

only 6066 persons in trades or professions honest enough to confess that they make
more than £500 and less than £600 a year ; only 6020 who confess to more than
£1000 and less than £2000 a year; only 997 persons who confess to £5000 and less
than £10,000. Since it cannot be supposed that people who cheat re<nilarlv once

a year will cheat only once a year, or that, beginning with cheating government,

they will end without cheating their customers, it is plain that the income-tax is
undermining the national honesty, and consequently that commercial prosperity
also of which national honesty is one of the bases. Although then an income-tax

may possibly not take out of people's pockets a great deal more than is paid into

the exchequer, it is calculated to keep out a great deal that would otherwise have

entered.

   Considering it to be thus apparent that every income-tax must necessarily be at

variance with just principles, Mr. Thornton proceeded to argue that a uniform
income-tax violates them to a needless extent. It does so by superadding to the

inequality and injustice inseparable from every income-tax an inequality and

--injustice peculiar to itself. This is implied by its very name a uniform in-

come-tax, i. e. a tax levied at the same rate on all incomes. But, says Adam

Smith, every one should pay taxes in proportion to his ability. His ability to do

what ? Obviously in proportion to his ability to pay taxes. "But sxich ability by

no means corresponds with income. To illustrate this point, Mr. Thornton sup-

posed two persons, each with £1000 a year, but the one a bachelor, and the other

a man with a family. Both have the same income, but their ability to bear taxa-

Adamtion is very different ; or, to use Ricardo's application of                                                           Smith's principle,

equal taxation requires from them very unequal sacrifices. Consequently, a tax

assessed at the same rate on all incomes, without reference to the varying amount

of claims on those incomes, is not assessed " in proportion to the respective abilities

of the several contributors." Moreover the income-tax is the only tax at present

in use amongst us which does affect incomes without regard to other claims upon
Athem.

to pay a smaller percentage on his income, in the shape of assessed taxes, customs,

and excise duties, than an unencumbered bachelor of equal income. It is the

income-tax alone which falls with indiseriminating weight upon both, and which,

regarding not the ability to pay taxes, but simply the amount of income, makes

the same deduction from the £ 1000 by which a dozen persons are to be supported,

as from the £1000 appropriated to the exclusive use of a single individual.

Here is one inequality incidental to a uniform income-tax. Another arises from

the equal assessment of permanent and precarious incomes. Two persons, each of

£1000 a year, but derived in the one case from landed, funded, or otherwise

realized property, and in the other, from the profits of trade, the gains of a pro-

fession, or the salary of an office, have not the same means of paying taxes. The

one may spend his £1000 a year for fifty years together, and at the end of that

period his means of spending £1000 a year will be found undiminished. But if a

merchant, or tradesman, or doctor, or lawyer, or railway secretary be silly enough

to spend the whole of his £1000 a year, then if health fail, or business fail, he may

suddenly find himself without a penny. Accordingly, he commonly puts by part

of his income, and spends only the remainder ; and the amount of that remainder

is the measure of his ability to pay taxes, the amount therefore on which he ought

to be taxed. In support of his view on this point, the writer quoted an expression

of Adam Smith, to the effect that " every subject of a state should contribute to

the support of the government in proportion to the revenue which he enjoys under

the protection of the state;'' from which he inferred that Smith intended to distin-

guish between the income which a man possesses and enjoys and that which he

possesses and does not enjoy, remarking that a man enjoys only that part of hia

income which he spends, and that he no more enjoys what he saves for the benefit

of his heirs than he enjoys the wine which is ripening in his cellar, and which

may not be fit to drink till he is gathered to his fathers, or which may be kept till

it spoils and may never be drank at all, just as money that is invested may not be

accumulating for the benefit of the actual owner, and perhaps may not be accumu-

lating at all, but may be dwindling away to nothing in the shape of railway shares.

Mr. Thornton proceeded to remark that, among the many faults of an income-tax,

there is only one which can be remedied. The tax is in most respects incurably

bad. Nothing can prevent its being a discouragement to honesty and a bounty

upon fraud, or from being collected at the expense of national probity, or from

pressing with equal weight on single and married men of the same income, not-

withstanding their unequal ability to bear the weight. One of its iniquities, how-

ever, is partially remediable. It might be prevented from ^pressing equally on

permanent and precarious incomes, in the manner proposed by Mr. Mill, viz. by

exempting from taxation that proportion of a precarious income which, taking the

average of cases, its recipient would be bound in prudence to save.

The remainder of the paper was occupied with an examination of objections to

Mr. Mill's suggestion. It has been urged that there is often a great difference between

what a man ought to save and what he does save ; and it has been asked, what could

be more monstrous than to extend exemption to a spendthrift, who, being bound in

prudence to lay by, say, a fourth of his income, thinks proper to spend all, and to

save nothing ? What could be more monstrous than to confer the reward assigned for

the performance of a particular duty to one who had culpably neglected to perform

that duty ? In Mr. Thornton's opinion it is more monstrous still to withhold the

reward from those who have performed the duty. In a country in which economists

must be to spendthrifts as 100 to 1, it woidd, he thinks, be better that one spend-

thrift should obtain an exemption which he does not deserve, rather than that a

hundred economists shoidd be denied the exemption they do deserve.

Again, it has been urged that to assess precarious at a lower rate than permanent

incomes, on the avowed ground, too, that the former belong to a poorer class of

--men, would be to tax the poor at a lower rate than the rich a measure subversive

of security of property. If, however, a reduced rate has been proposed for preca-

rious incomes, it has been on the supposition that whatever rate were adopted

would be assessed on the whole income. But to assess the whole of a precarious

and the whole of a permanent income at the same rate would be to disregard their

relative ability to bear taxation. If onlv that part of an income be taxed on which
                                                                                                                                            '

depends ability to pay, no one will object to the same rate being applied to all in-
comes. It is only because injustice is committed by taxing the whole income, that
an attempt is made to repair the injustice by demanding that a lower rate be im-
posed than woidd be proper if only part were taxed.

  A third objection to Mr. Mill's suggestion is the opposite of the second. It has

been said that to exempt savings would be to favour the rich at the expense of the
poor, inasmuch as it is by the comparatively rich that the greater part of savings
are made. To this Mr. Thornton answers, that if the rich pay on all they spend,
and are exempted only on what they save, they obtain the exemption only on that
part of their income with respect to which they abdicate the advantage of riches,
not consuming it themselves, but making it over to be consumed by the poor.
Moreover, if they pay on all they spend, they pay on all they enjoy; and the prin-

ciple that every man should pay on what he enjoys, whether the sum be great or

small, is fully carried out.

                      MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

Address o/ William Fairbaihn, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., President of the Section.
Every succeeding year presents to our notice some new feature of construction,
or some new application of science to the useful arts. Last year we had to record
several new discoveries in chemical as well as mechanical science ; and this year

is fruitful of machinery and the industrial developments, as exhibited in the

courts of the International Exhibition. It is not my intention to occupy your time

with a history of these Exhibitions, but I may be permitted to notice some of the
most interesting objects, and some of the ingenious contrivances which we are
called upon to witness, and which do honour to the age in which we live. Before

I venture on a description of these objects, I must, however, crave your indulgence
whilst I endeavour to notice some of the more important improvements which have
taken place in mechanical science during some of the past years.

   It may be stated that there is no period of the past history of science so fruitful
in discoveries as the present century. Within the last fifty years we are enabled

to enumerate the application of steam as a motive power to every description of

manufacture, as also to navigation, locomotion, and agriculture. At the close of
the eighteenth century the power of steam and its now almost universal applica-

tion was, with the exception of a few engines by Boulton and Watt, comparatively

unknown. Now it is the handmaid of all work, from our domestic requirements

to the ocean-steamer of a thousand horses' power. This we may consider as the
present state of steam and the steam-engine, and we have only to compare the

small but beautiful construction of engines for private and domestic use, as seen in
the Exhibition of this year, with those which propel our fleets, drain our mines,

and move with clockwork precision the innumerable machines of our manufacto-
ries. To these we may add the use of steam to locomotion, and we realize the law
 of heat reciprocally convertible into mechanical force, or the dynamic theory of
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                               179

work done, in the energy of nearly a thousand horses' power, at fifty miles an hour.

How wonderful and yet how effective are the powers of this comparatively small

machine ! It is perfectly docile, and obeys the hand of its director with almost
mathematical precision, and by the touch of a simple lever it regulates its move-
ments to the nicety of an inch," or it bounds forward with a momentum, regardless

of time or distance, and careers on its iron track like a dream of the Arabian Nights.

In fact, we may almost regard them as realized, when we consider the smallness

of the space and the organisms by which these wonderful results are attained.

Apart from the flight of fancy, we arrive at the conclusion that these are facts

already accomplished with a degree of certainty that ceases to be wonderful, ex-

cept only to the uninitiated, who stares at what he is unable to comprehend. The

general principles of the steam-engine and the locomotive are, however, easily

acquired ; and in this age of steam it should, in my opinion, form a separate branch
of education for the benefit of both sexes, to whom it woidd be highly advantageous.

It is a branch of knowledge of deep importance to the present and rising genera-

tion ; and as steam and its application to the varied purposes of civilized life becomes

every day more apparent, a knowledge of its powers and properties is much

wanted, and ought not to be neglected.

I am the more desirous that instruction of this kind shoidd be imparted to the

rising generation in our public schools, as it would lead to practical acquaintance

with instruments and machines in daily use, and would familiarize the more intel-

ligent classes with objects on which, at the present day, we almost exclusively de-
pend for the comforts and enjoyments of life. I do not mean that we should make

scholars engineers ; but they ought to be taught the general principles of the arts,
in order to appreciate their value and to apply them to the useful purposes by which

we are surrounded. It is by the acquisition of this knowledge that we shall over-

come ignorance, so often fatal in the use of steam, and not unfrequently attended

Wewith danger to life and property.     might quote numerous examples of fatal

boiler explosions and other casualties arising from this cause ; and this want of

knowledge is not only productive of danger, but it leaves important matters to be

directed by the hands of incompetency, instead of being guided by the arm of intel-

ligence. The introduction of steam and its application to such a variety of pur-
poses was shortly followed by that of gas, and this brilliant discovery we owe to

the untutored mind of o*e of our first working mechanics, William Murdock of
Soho, the assistant and contemporary of Watt. Mr. Murdock lighted up his own

house and Soho about the year 1802 or 1803, and in 1804 gas was first applied to

light Messrs. Philip and Lee's cotton-mills at Manchester. For some years it made

little or no progress, but it was, in 1814, employed for lighting the streets of towns

and we are, therefore, indebted to William Murdock and carburetted hydrogen

for the enjoyment of a pure and brilliant light in our streets and public buildings,

and in almost every house and town in the empire.

Next to gas came steam-navigation, railways, and locomotion, and subsequently

the electric telegraph. I will not, however, tire you with any detailed notice of

these discoveries, however important they may be in a scientific point of view, but

simply advert to those departments of science with which the members of this

Section are more immediately interested. In taking even a cursory view of the

machinery of the two annexes of the International Exhibition, we cannot be other-

wise than struck with the multiplicity of the objects, the perfection of the execu-

tion, and the accuracy of the tools, together with the numerous devices by which

Athese are attained.  very casual glance at this Exhibition when compared with

that of 1851, and that of Paris in 1855, shows with what intensity and alacrity the

public mind has been at work since the people of all nations were first called upon

to compete with each other in the peaceful rivalry of mechanical art.

Taking the Exhibition as a whole, there is no very great nor very important

discovery in mechanical science ; but there is a great deal to be seen of a character

both interesting and instructive. In land steam-engines there is nothing particularly

attractive, if we except the growing importance of the horizontal, which is rapidly

supplanting that of the beam or vertical engine. To the horizontal system may be

applied economy in the first cost, and nearly equal efficiency in its application to

mills and for manufacturing purposes. Another important feature in these engines

                                                                       12*

is their smooth and noiseless motion, their compact form, and the facility with

which they can be applied as helps or assistants to those of larger dimensions.

They are, moreover, executed with a degree of finish and accuracy of workman-

ship which cannot easily be surpassed.

In the agricultural department the same observations apply to this description

of engine, where it is extensively used on a smaller scale. They are equally well

made, and the country at large are chiefly indebted to our agricultural engineers

for many ingenious contrivances, and for their successful application, not exclu-

sively to the farm, but to many other useful purposes in the economy of rural
              "

life.

From the motive power employed in our manufactories and its adaptation to

agriculture let us glance at the beautiful execution, compact form, and colossal

dimensions of our marine engines, and we shall And, in combination, simplicity of

form, concentration of power, and precision of action never before equalled in this

or any other country. In this department of construction we are without rivals,

and it is a source of pride that this country, as the first maritime nation in the world,

should stand preeminently first as the leader of naval propulsion.

In locomotive as in marine constructions we are not behind, if we are not in

advance of other nations, although it must be admitted that several splendid spe-

cimens of engines from France and Germany are exhibited by some of the best

makers of those countries. There is, however, this distinction between the Conti-

nental locomotives and those of home manufacture, and that is, in this country

there is greater simplicity and design, greater compactness of form, and clearer

conceptions in working out the details of the parts. These operations, when

carefully executed to standard gauges, render each paii; of an engine a facsimile

of its fellow; and hence follows the perfection of a system where every part is

a repetition of a whole series of parts, and, in so far as accuracy is concerned, it is a

great improvement on the old system of construction.

The other parts of the Exhibition are well entitled to a careful inspection. In

minerals and raw material the collections are numerous and valuable to an extent

never before witnessed in any Exhibition ; and the articles, fuel and ores, will be

found highly instructive. The machinery for pumping, winding, and crushing is

upon a scale sufficiently large and comprehensive to engage the attention of the

mechanic and miner, and it is only to be regretted that in every case competent

persons are not in attendance fully prepared to explain and initiate the inexperi-

enced student in the principles of the workings, and the cases of instruments so

neatly classified and spread before him for instruction.

In the machinery department, although there is nothing that strikes the observer

at first sight as new, yet there are many useful improvements calculated to econo-

mize labour and facilitate the operations of spinning and weaving ; and in tool-

making there never was at any former period so many hands and heads at work as

on the occasion pending the opening of the Exhibition. Some of the tools, such as

the turning-, boring-, planing-,  and slotting-machines,  are of a very high order                                                                                                          and
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the tool-machinery for the manufacture of fire-arms, shells, rockets, &c, is of that

character as to render the whole operations, however minute, perfectly automaton
or self-acting, with an accuracy of repetition that leaves the article, when finished,

identical with every other article from the same machine. Such, in fact, is the

perfection of the tool-system a3 it now exists, that in almost every case we may

calculate on a degree of exactitude that admits of no deviation beyond a thousandth

part of an inch.

Amongst the many interesting mechanical objects exhibited in the two annexes

may be noticed as original, the spool-machine, for the winding of sewing-thread

on bobbins, the machine for making paper bags (invented by a pupil of my own),

the saw-riband machine, and others of great merit as regards ingenuity of con-

trivance and adaptation of design. In manufactures, in design, and in constructive

art, there is even-thing that could be desired in the shape of competitive skill

and, without viewing the success of the Great Exhibition of this year in a pecu-

niary point of view, we may safely attribute its great success to the interesting and

instructive character of the objects submitted to public inspection.

Irrespective of the Exhibition, with its invaluable and highly finished specimens,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  181

we have briefly to notice some of the improvements and changes that have taken

place in the construction of ordnance and the art of defence, and to chronicle some
of the most important results -which have placed the whole of our naval and mili-
tary armaments in a state of transition. It is now well understood that His Majesty
the Emperor of the French was the first to apply iron plates as a defence to the
sides of ships, and that ships of war protected with a given thickness of plate 4£
inches were invulnerable to shot or shell. For a considerable length of time this

opinion was prevalent, and was acted upon both in this country, France, and Ame-
rica. The experiments instituted by the Admiralty and War Office have, to a great
extent, dispelled these notions; and it has been proved that a smooth-bored Arm-

strong gun, with al50-lb. spherical shot, can pierce a4|-inch-thick plate and 18inches
of teak. In fact, it has been proved by experiment that no vessel yet constructed
is able to carry armour-plates of sufficient thickness to resist such powerful ordnance

as has been brought against them.

   Every effort has been made on the part of the Government to determine experi-
mentally the properties of iron best calculated to resist shot, and the greatest pos-

sible care has been observed, both in a chemical and mechanical point of view, to
secure the very best description of iron for that purpose. All these facts have been
ascertained, as also the penetrating powers of different descriptions of ordnance as
compared with the thickness of the plates to be pierced. In this position the

mbalance of force to the resistance of the plate was favour of the gun, but with

this qualification, that the gim had to sustain an explosive force of powder equivalent
to one-third the weight of the shot, a charge which the gun was unable to bear.
Under ordinary circumstances, with the usual charge of one-eighth the weight of
the shot, it might reasonably be inferred that the balance was on the side of the
plate, and that guns of such heavy calibre were insufficient in strength to sustain
these tremendous charges of powder. Again, it must be borne in mind that these
results were only produced at certain distances, and under certain conditions of

heavy charges of powder and a short range of 200 yards.
   The inquiry was thus hanging on the balance, when it was determined to ascer-

tain the effect of the large Horsfall gun of 22 tons weight with a charge of 75 lbs.
of powder and a 300-lb. shot, against a target representing the ' Warrior,' with her
18 inches of teak and 4| inches of iron. The result of this experiment was the
penetration of the mass, with a huge opening in the side of the target upwards of

2 feet in diameter. This experiment is probably not calculated to apply to ships
of war carrying ordnance of such immense weight, but it is greatly in favour of

forts, where" an enemy's vessel may be struck at a distance of lOOO yards.
   Passing from the Horsfall gun, we now come to the last and most important

experiments with the Whitworth gun : the first was a 12-pounder field-gun, and
the second a 70-pounder naval gun ; both of the guns were rifled. These experi-
ments are very instructive, and I probably could not do better than quote from the
'Times,' of September 18th, a statement of the effect produced by these guns:

    " It will, perhaps, be remembered that a decided difference was established very
early in the controversy between the penetrating powers of solid shot and those

 of shell. Solid shot at one time failed, and at another time succeeded, against
 armour-plates, according to the modified conditions of the experiments ; but shells

failed absolutely and invariably. No shell could ever be driven through even a

moderately thick plate of iron, and it was concluded, therefore, that this, the most

 dangerous and dreaded species of missile, could undoubtedly be kept out of a ship

by a thin casing of armour.
    "Accordingly, as a reduction of a ship's armour to the least possible weight was

of great consequence, especially in small vessels, gunboats and other craft of the like

 description have been built in some countries with 2|-inch or 2-inch armour-plates,

and considered effectually shell-proof. On Tuesday, however, Mr. Whitworth

 entered the field with two of his pieces, for the service of which he had specially
prepared some fiat-fronted, hardened shells. The 12-pounder, at 200 yards, presently
 sent these shells through a 2-inch plate backed by a foot of timber; from which

 simple piece of evidence the conclusion is inevitable, that vessels protected to that

extent only are shell-proof no longer.

    " But in the trial of the 70-pounder an additional result was obtained. It has
--182 report 1862.

been suggested that if, instead of employing a given thickness of iron in one solid

piece, the armour of a ship were divided into two plates, each of half that thick-

ness, and these plates were separated by a certain space from each other, the resist-

ing power of the structure might be much increased. The theory was that the first

plate, though it would doubtless be pierced, would so deaden the force of the shot,

that the second plate would repel it ; and, indeed, as regards solid shot, the ques-

tion remains still undecided. AVith respect to shell, however, or rather Mr. Whit-

worth's shells, we are not left in doubt even on this point. The 70-pounder was
Atrained against a target constructed on this principle of a double side.
                                                                           strong

oak frame, armed with 4-inch plates, was attached to a second plated to the depth

of 2 inches, an interval of two or three feet being left between them. The shell

from this gim, fired with 12 lbs. of powder only, pierced the outer side of the target

completely, oak and iron together, after which it burst inside the frame and shat-

tered it to pieces."

  From this statement we learn, that 4 inches of solid iron and 9 inches of wood

are no protection against shells discharged from a moderately sized gun, and tbat no
gunboat, such as those on the American waters, could prevent the entrance of these
dreaded and destructive missiles. In point of fact, Sir. Whitworth, with a rifled
gun lighter than the 68-pounder, could destroy them by his steel-hardened shells

at a distance of 1500 to 2000 yards.
   Since the above was written another experiment has been made with a still larger

gun, rifled on Mr. Whitworth's hexagonal principle. This gun was of large calibre,

120-pounder, at a distance of 600 yards, and the results seem to prove that the

side of a vessel like the 'Warrior' is no longer shell-proof. In these experiments

130-lb. solid shot, with a charge of 23 lbs. of powder, went right through the 45-

Ainch armour-plate and lodged in the teak backing behind.  shell of the same

weight, and a charge of 25 lbs. of powder, also penetrated the armour-plate and
exploded, tearing the wood backing, and lodged on the opposite side.

   From these more recent experiments we may infer that the victory is on the side
of the gun, and that it may be difficult, under such fearful odds, to construct ships

of sufficient power to prevent their destruction by the entrance of shells. Other

experiments are, however, in progress, and means may jet be adopted to solve the

question of armour-ships versus shot and shell.

On the Importance of Economizing Fuel in Iron-plated Ships. By E. E. Allen.

   Iron-plated ships, to be efficient, ought to be able to cany coals for fourteen days
but in consequence of the weight of the armour, and the present mode of generating
and using the steam, only coals enough for seven days can be earned. In future
wars, despatch in going to the seat of war, and high speed in manoeuvring, will be
necessary ; therefore much fuel must be used ; hence the desirabihty of studying
how to economize fuel. The deficiency of boiler-power in the Royal Navy is too
well known. Modern inventions have increased the displacement of ships : thus,

the armour, coals, and machinery are about equal in weight; and 1C00 horses'
power will consume 200 tons of coal a day, under fidl steam, say at ten knots per
hour ; but the necessary power for increasing the speed from ten to twelve knots
demands double the fuel ; and if the speed be increased to sixteen knots, the amount

of fuel must be quadrupled. Some of our new war-ships only move at 9^ knots an
hour, whereas it is generally allowed they shoidd make 15 knots ; 5000 miles ought

to be steamed without re-coaliug, but only one-third of that distance can be accom-

plished. As a proof that the boilers are too small, it may be affirmed that none
of the ships in the Royal Navy can work fidl steam, and keep the throttle-valves

open, for more than a few hours at a time. Six-hundred horse-power boilers should

be used where only 400 horse-power boilers are now used. Coal is the only item
in which weight can be saved. The merchant vessels only consume half the coals

(for ships of the same size) of those in the Royal Navy. Cornish engines consume
2J pounds of coal per horse-power per horn- ; 2| pounds ought to be the limit in

--marine engines ; but 6 pounds are generally used in the Royal Navy. He proposed

the following methods for economizing fuel : To proportion the boilers to the steam

required ; to increase the capacity of the cylinders, but not the length of the stroke
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                          183

to superheat the steam; to jacket the cylinders to warm the injection water; to

work the steam expansively by having two cylinders, a small one at the back of the
large one, or concentrically within the large one, and to let the steam into the small
cylinder first. Although he recommended this to our Admiralty in 1855, no notice
was taken of it. The Swedish Government have adopted it in their new gun-boats,

and it obtained a medal at the present Exhibition. By these arrangements for

economy, and with better-designed engines, 17,000 tons of coal per day might be
saved throughout our fleet ; but now, after steaming 2000 miles, the ships have to
creep into port, under canvas, to be re-coaled. 40 per cent, of power might be
added, and therefore a greater speed of one-and-a-half knot per hour obtained,
without greater displacement ; and 14 tons per horse-power per annum, or a mil-
lion tons of coals per annum, for the whole fleet might be saved.

On Artificial Stones. By Professor D. T. Ansted, M.A.

In this paper the author described the various materials and contrivances used

for the purpose of replacing stoDe where natural stone could not be advantageously

procured. He described, in succession, terra cottas, cements, and siliceous stones,

pointing out the character, properties, uses, advantages, and disadvantages of each.

He alluded to experiments made in the laboratory on the various methods sug-

gested for preserving stone by a Section of the Committee recently appointed by

the Board of Works in reference to the Palace of Westminster; Dr. Hofmann, Dr.

Frankland, Mr. Abel, and the author being members of it. During their investiga-

tions a remarkable material was submitted by Mr. Ransome for their considera-

tion, and its discovery arose out of Ransome's method of preserving stone by

effecting a deposit of silicate of lime within the substances of the absorbent stone,

saturating the surface with a solution of silicate of soda, and then applying a solu-

tion of chloride of calcium ; thus producing a rapid double decomposition, leaving

an insoluble silicate of lime within the stone, and a soluble chloride of sodium,

which coidd afterwards be removed by washing. To prove this, Mr. Ransome

made small blocks of sand in moidds by means of silicate of soda, and then dipped

them in chloride of calcium. The result was the formation, almost instantane-

ously, of a perfectly compact, hard, and, to all appearance, a perfectly durable

solid. Mr. Ransome at once adopted the process for the formation of an artificial

stone which, the author of the paper considered, would combine the advantages,

and avoid some of the disadvantages, of other artificial stones. Experience, how-
Aever, can alone be the test of its durability.
                                                 specimen weighing two tons was

shown in the International Exhibition, and the substance is used in the stations of

the Metropolitan Railway. It is cheap, and can be made, on the spot, of almost any

rubbish or material, and of any form or size. Experiments made by Mr. Ransome

show that, as compared with Portland stone or Caen stone, a bar with section 4

inches square and 8 inches long, suspended midway between supports, sustained

2122 lbs., while similar bars of Portland and Caen" stone broke respectively with
750 lbs. and 780 lbs. The adhesion of the stone was shown by weights suspended
from a piece prepared to expose a sectional area of 5^ inches. Caen stone sepa-

rated at 768 lbs. ; Bath, at 796 lbs. ; Portland, at 1104 lbs. ; Elland Edge, at 1874 lbs.

ARansome's, at 1980 lbs.  cube of 4 inches of Ransome's stone sustained 30 tons.

 By Charles Atherton, late Chief Engineer in H.M. Dockyard, Woolwich.

   The author observes that competitive rivalry in the construction of ships of war
with a view to their being "invulnerable," and in the construction of ordnance
with a view to its being effective for penetrating the build even of armoured ships,
appears, from the experiments which have been carried on at Shoeburyness, to be a

question involving unlimited expenditure in possibly abortive ship-building, the
result of which rivalry between ordnance and iron plating, being dependent on future

invention, does not admit of present definite solution.
    Nevertheless the principle of " invulnerability " in the construction of ships of

war by the agency of iron plating having been originated and adopted by France
               present the most effective system of naval construction, though admitted

to be imperfect, there has arisen internationally a necessity for its adoption until

it shall be met or superseded by some other device ; and the object of the author,

by this paper, is to bring before the notice of the British Association for the

Advancement of Science the question, which has been otherwise publicly agitated

by him, whether the principle of "invulnerability," as based on " armour-plating,"

may not be superseded bj' the principle of "unsinkability," as based on the

principle of constructing ships with such a mass of uninflammable materials of a

specific gravity less than that of water as shall support the hull and its entire load,

and float, however perforated by shot laterally through the sides of the ship, or

vertically through the deck and bottom of the vessel by the still more formidable

effect of an improved mortar-practice pitching shells of great weight with an in-

fallible precision at short range, or even still float in parts when severed by the

concussion of a hostile ram.

  Though the vessel may thus be u unsinkable," it is not professed or anticipated by

the author that war would be prosecuted without the sacrifice of blood ; for though

the proposed construction of shipping would be well adapted for protecting the

crews of ships from small arms, still the cannon or the mortar would take effect.

The chief point on which the principle of "unsinkable ships" is put forward by

the author as claiming consideration is that, by the adoption of this principle, the

whole crew of a ship would not be simultaneously drowned through the effective

application of a single shot, shell, or ram-stroke, as might be the case with armoured

ships, seeing that the direct fire of artillery is still paramount, and the mortar prac-

tice above referred to has not yet been tried.

  A further advantage consequent on adopting the principle of " unsinkability

would be that it does not necessitate the construction of ships of such large size as
is required for carrying out the principle of " invulnerability " by armour-plating.

Also by avoiding top-weight, by which armour-plated ships are so much encum-
bered, many difficulties in the prosecution of naval architecture are obviated. It is

therefore conceived that this principle of " unsinkability " would be well adapted

for gun-boats and mortar-vessels destined to act in cooperation with each other in

assailing larger vessels at close quarters, or doing service in shoal waters, such

vessels receiving their stores from high-speed steamers of ordinary build acting as

store and hospital and barrack ships, to be kept out of harm's way. Also the prin-

ciple of unsinkability would be well adapted for troop ships and the safe convey-

ance of valuable cargoes and treasure.

The details of construction of the " unsinkable ship," as respects the disposal of

its unsinkable materials, will be dependent on the purpose for which the ship may

be especially intended. For example, the whole mass of material on which the ship

depends for its unsinkability may be in a solid mass, with the whole of its hold

accommodation above the deep-draught water-level ; or the vessel may have a hold

below the level of the load water-line, provided that the required mass of buoyant

material be otherwise disposed of, constituting the sides or ends and bottom and

decks of the vessel. Of course such a vessel with a hold below the load-line level

may become water-logged, and, if a steamer, disabled ; but still such a vessel would

sail, and the crew would be alive to do good service from her deck; at all events,

her whole crew could not be simultaneously sent to the bottom, which is the great

--catastrophe intended to be obviated by the principle of unsinkable ships a cata-

strophe to which armour-plated ships, though bulkheaded, will be liable if artil-

lery or mortar practice become paramount.

The required brevity of this abstract does not admit of the details of calculation

and of construction for the production of " unsinkable ships " of given capabilities

On Coryton's Vertical- Wave-Line SJ^s, Self-Reefing Sails, and Guide-Pro-
        peller. By John Corttox, of Lincoln's Inn, Barrister-at-Law.

   The object of the inventor has been to produce a form of vessel which shall com-

bine the weatherly qualities of a clipper ship, with the advantages of increased speed

when going free, and greater safety when scudding before a gale, riding at an

anchor, or becoming suddenly unmanageable through loss of niasts, damage to her

machinery, &c.

    This object is attained by a revolution in the tactics of sailing, as well as in a

change of form. When close-hauled, or steaming head to wind, the vessel goes

--to use the parlance applicable to the present form of ships head foremost ; when

sailing or steaming off the wind, she goes, so to speak, stern foremost. In still

water the vessel proceeds always on the latter plan. The terms stem, bow, and

stern being obviously unsuited to vessels of the proposed form, the inventor sub-

stitutes for them the "weather end" and "lee end " respectively.
   Novel as the general idea pervading this invention may appear, the deviation in

point of form of a Vertical-Wave-Line vessel from the type of ships at present

existing is very slight. Taking as a standard a fast clipper schooner of the latest
build with a " tumble home " bow, tine entry lines, beam carried right aft to the
taflrail, and a flat counter, something very like the proposed form will be obtained
by cutting away the entire after-keel almost from the fore-foot ; the " weather end"
thus becoming (approximately) a vertical wedge, and the " lee end" (approximately

also) a horizontal wedge. Provided these forms are preserved, the intermediate

work is of little consequence, and may be constructed simply with regard to the

--ordinary rules of carpentering a point of economy which those practically ac-

quainted with ship-building- will not fail to appreciate. "It seems," is the obser-
vation of M. Vial de Clairbois in his ' Architecture Navale' (p. 22), " that naval
architects have hitherto affected to avoid straight lines, although geometrically they

have the advantage of simplicity over all others." By a coincidence which may

appear almost accidental, it will be found that at two points of the vessel con-
structed on the new principle (and in these, in the larger class of vessels, it is pro-
posed to bulk-head them), sections made by planes slightly out of the perpendi-

--cular approach very nearly the catenary a self-supporting curve. The inventor

proposes to construct his vessels of laminated iron up to the water-line, and to make
the works above, for the convenience of rough repairs, of wood. By making the
iron planks taper towards the ends, and decrease in number as they are placed
higher on the ship's side, the greatest strength of the vessel may be placed with

almost mathematical accuracy at the point exposed to the greatest strain.

   The advantages of this system, besides economy and strength, may be shortly

stated thus : Safety. If disabled, instead of rolling in the trough of the sea like

the ' Great Eastern ' on a recent occasion, a Vertical-Wave-Line ship flies head to
wind at once, and remains so as long as she can hold together. In boats of this

construction " broaching-to " (the fertile source of disaster in passing through

surfs or being beached) is entirely avoided, the boat being always kept by the
action of the water in the only position compatible with safety. The same pecu-

liarity of form, offering a maximum deflection to an impinging body, renders Ver-

Atical-Wave-Line ships admirably adapted for the purposes of naval warfare.

model of a Shield Ship on this principle was exhibited at the International Exhi-

--bition during the present year.
   Stability. Vertical-Wave-Line ships will never accumulate rolling motion.
From the form of the immersed body, if lateral disturbance take place, the axis of

rotation changes with such rapidity as to render it all but impossible that any sub-

sequent impact of wind or sea can have the efl'ect of increasing, and almost certain
that each such impact will actually neutralize, the existing momentum. It is

this peculiarity, coupled with its safety in exposed situations, that has induced the

inventor to suggest this form as suitable for the establishment of a system of Fair-

way Lighting in the English and Irish Channels, plans and models of which were

recently exhibited at the International Exhibition of 18G2.

   In respect of Speed, a very remarkable phenomenon presents itself, in the case
of Vertical-Wave-Line ships sailing off" the wind or steaming free, working con-
sequently "lee end" foremost. For every increase of speed there is a decrease of
draught. That there is a limit to the truth of this is of course evident ; but as a
totally new problem, the inventor anticipates from its investigation very extra-
ordinary results. From the absence of keel at the lee end, the vessel steers of
course with great handiness, and with the Guide-Propeller can be made to turn in
her own length.
--186 report 1862.

    The revolution in tactics alluded to above, rendered of course the ordinary
system of rigging useless, and the inventor has consequently devised the system of

Self-reefing traversing sails (also lately exhibited at the International Exhibition).

The masts, which are T-shaped, are supported by revolving shears, and the sails

are fixed on spars rigidly attached to the masts. The mast is thus inclined to the

--wind, or " rakes," to use the ordinary term, whether the vessel be by the wind or

going free an arrangement which, for the same vertical height of masts, gives a
greater and far more efficient spread of canvas than can be produced by any of the

systems now in use. On a smart breeze springing up, the sails reef themselves to

the compass requisite for the vessel's progress ; and, as the gale freshens, reef after

reef is taken in, until, when it is at its height, her sails will be found close-reefed,
without the employment of a single hand. If the ship be clear of the land, her
sails can be furled, her helm left, and the ship will ride the gale out head to wind.

    Ships and boats on this principle can, of course, equally with any others, be pro-
pelled by steam or other power. In his Atmospheric Guide-Propeller (exhibited
also in 1851 (Class VIII. 82) and 1862 (Class XII. 27-46)), the inventor has endea-
voured to introduce a great simplification into ship propulsion, by combining the
processes of steering and propelling. The plan consists in pumping a current of air
through tubes which are led outside the vessel into the water, this cm-rent being
capable of the nicest regulation and change of direction by means of valves.

"Water may be used instead of air, and is recommended for boats, in which, it may

be observed, oars are entirely dispensed with, and propulsion is effected by hauling
on an endless rope.

    The last point is Ventilation, and for the appreciation of the advantages of the
new system in this respect it is almost necessary to refer to models. In the Ex-
hibition of 1862 a model was shown, made to a scale, and intended to test the
relative merits of a ship on this system and the ' Great Eastern.' The dimensions
of the vessel on the Vertical-Wave-Line system of equal tonnage were, length 432

feet (as against 700 in the case of the ' Great Eastern '), breadth 108 feet, depth
76 feet.

   Models and drawings illustrative of the construction and propulsion of Vertical-

Wave-Line ships may be seen at the Naval Museum of the Royal Lnited Service
Institution, Middle Scotland Yard, and at the Museum of the Commissioners of

Patents, South Kensington.

       A New Marine Boiler for generating Steam of High Pressure.

                                    By Dr. F. Grimaldi.

   The boiler was a cylindrical tubular boiler, with certain arrangements of radial
tubes for taking up and conveying the steam, and made to rotate slowly in the fur-
nace on its axis. The advantages claimed were freedom from priming, smallness
of space occupied, superheating the steam, and economy of fuel.

              On the Prevention of Beat/way Aecidmts. By J. Sewell.

   The author considered that the main cause of accidents was the want of punctu-
ality in the trains ; and that this arose mainly from the overloading of them, which
rendered it impossible that they could keep time. Engines were made to perform
certain work, and draw certain loads, and if these were exceeded it was impossible
that time could be kept. This was a matter that the public could not ascertain
for themselves, and he therefore advocated the importance of having engines
licensed, like boats, omnibuses, &c, by Government, to draw certain loads ; and a

statement giving that information should be placed conspicuously on the engine.
This would prevent the overloading, as it would be in the power of every passenger
to see whether the power of the engine was duly apportioned to the carriages it had
to draw.

On the Failure of the Sluice in Fern, and on the Means of securing such Sluices

   The author described the circumstances attending the failure of the sluice, and

pointed out by a diagram that, in his opinion, the mode of preventing such an acci-
dent in future was the employment of double sluices, one behind the other, the
water between the two being always kept locked iu, at a mean height between the

water in the drain and that on the sea-side, during the time the sea doors are closed
by the tide ; by this mode, the pressure of the highest tide, on each set of doors,
will be only one-fourth of that on the single set of doors, on the fallen sluice, at the
time of the disaster. Hence its undoubted safety.

 On the Merits of Wooden and Iron Ships, ivith, regard to cost of repairs and
                         security for life. By L. "Williamson.

   The author called attention, in particular, to an iron ship, the ' Santiago,' which
met with a collision, the consequences of which woidd have been absolute destruc-
tion of the vessel had she been of wood ; whereas, being of iron and having water-
tight compartments, the vessel was able to pursue her voyage, and was repaired at
the cost of a few hundred pounds, instead of several thousands which would have
been necessary had she been made of wood and coidd have been preserved from

foundering.

Oblate Projectiles with Cycloidal Rotation, contrasted with Cylindro-ogival

   Projectiles having Helical or Rifle Rotation. By R. W. Woollcombe.

   The object of this paper was further to discuss the views of the author given in

a paper read before the Koyal Society in March last (1862), entitled, " An Account

of some Experiments with Excentric Oblate Bodies and Discs as Projectiles," and

to show the result of further experiments. Rifled cannon, it appears, cannot project

heavy elongated shot with high initial velocity ; and, except with the Whitworth

flat-headed shot, the penetration of iron plates can only be effected by means of a

high velocity. The author considers that however well the helical or rifle method

with cylindrical elongated shot may answer for small arms, yet that, when we wish

to project great weights with great and sustained velocities, we shall succeed better

if our mechanical arrangements are less antagonistic than the rifle principle to the

great laws of nature, as exhibited in the form, method of rotation, and translation

of the great natural projectiles, the planets. None of these are prolate bodies pro-

mjected with helical rotation about their longest diameters and the direction of

such axis. The author states that he has found it practicable to project a body

--that, instead of being prolate, is more or less oblate, that, instead of having helical

rotation at the expense of translation, has cycloidal rotation in aid of translation.

A projectile, having a circular periphery in the line of motion in the gun, leaves the

bore as a common round shot, and has the additional security for high initial

velocity of windage less than for round shot of similar weight. The terminal

velocity is also provided for by the oblateness, and by the axis of rotation being

always transverse to, and not in the plane of, the trajectory. The gun has a similar

transverse section to that of the projectile, the bore being straight and smooth.

--The projectile is a disk, and it should be slightly excentric to make it rotate so

slight as to be little more than the inevitable excentricity of every spherical projec-

tile. The author then gave the results of some actual experiments with a gim

and projectiles made on this principle. The gun was 20 \ inches long ; the calibre,

long diameter If- inch, and short diameter f inch. The shot weighed nearly 8 ounces,
with a charge of 2 J ounces, or three-fifths the weight of the shot ; the penetration
at 25 yards from an oak target was a mean of 11 inches, reckoning to the near side

of the disk, and to the far side nearly 18 inches.

The initial velocity, measured by Havez's electro-ballistic apparatus, was 1487 feet

Aper second.  comparison was made with a small brass gun, length of bore

34-625 inches, or nearly double the length of the author's gun in calibres. The

mean calibre of the brass gim was 1-6 inch, the mean diameter of the round shot

was T43 inch ; and this gun, fired with a proportionate charge of powder, showed

that the disk gun gave more than double the penetration of the brass gun, and an

initial velocity of 1487 to 1091 of the latter. He thought that these remarkable

experiments showed that the subject was worthy of further consideration.

On the Solution of the Linear Equation of Finite Differences in its most

                General Form. By Prof. Sylvester, F.R.S.

The author exhibited (and illustrated with examples) a simple and readily ap-

plied method of obtaining the general term (and consequently the complete solution)

of an equation of finite differences with any number of independent variables, a

question which, although touched upon by Libri and laboriously investigated by

Binet, had hitherto, to the best of his knowledge, remained unsolved even in the case

of an equation with but one independent variable with non-constant coefficients

when the coefficients are supposed constant, the well-known solution flows as

an immediate corollary from the author's general form. Essentially the method

depends upon the adoption of a natural principle of notation for the given coeffi-

cients, according to which each coefficient is to be denoted by a twofold group
of indices, the number of the double indices in a group being equal to the num-

ber of independent variables in the given equation. _ Thus, supposing u m , »,p . . . to

be expressible by means of the given general equation, as a sum of tc's with infe-

rior indices, the coefficient of ut/ ,, w . . . ia that sum must be denoted by the double

is then shown to be reducible virtually to the problem of effecting the simulta-
neous decomposition of the integer variables x,y,z... into parts in every possible
manner and order of relative arrangement, the magnitudes of such parts being

limited by the degree or degrees of the given equation in respect of these variables.
The collective value of the terms thus obtained constituting the complete solution

may be termed, in the author's nomenclature, a hyper-cumulant, whose properties

and their applications remain to be studied out as those of the elementary kinds of

common cumulants have been to a considerable extent in the ordinary theoiy of
continued fractions. The first stage in the process of constructing the terms of a

general euniulant or general hyper-curuulant is almost identical with that of finding
the coefficients in the expansion of a power of a polynomial function of one or
several variables, differing from it indeed only in the circumstance that permutations

which lead to repetitions in the latter case, represent distinct values in the former.

                   On Aerolites. By Professor N. S. Maskelyne.

   Professor Maskelyne prefaced a series of notices of meteorites lately added to the

collection in the British Museum by some observations on the phenomena that
accompany the fall of such bodies to the earth. Loud reports and the develop-
ment of brilliant light in the sky are among the most generally observed of these
phenomena. The fallen mass or its fragments, besides the marked characters they
constantly present, as well in composition as in the mode of aggregation of their

component minerals, exhibit also invariably a superficial enamelling or incrustation.

The meteorite which fell at Butsura, in India, on May 12, 1861, accompanied by

successive reports and a luminosity in the sky visible in the daytime, presented

some new and very interesting facts bearing on the cause of this incrustation. The

whole of the fragments found, though they fell in four places, at distances of three
or four miles apart, formed the parts of a large piece of an aerolite, fitting to one
another with great exactness, with the exception of two of them, between which

an intermediate fragment had been lost. Some of the fragments were found to be

entirely coated with crust, yet capable of being adjusted to each other with

umnistakeable accuracv ; others again exhibited no such incrustation at the parts
where they fitted to each other, and were yet, like the former, found several miles
asunder. *It was obvious from this that some of these fragments had become
coated with crust after they had been severed, while others had been so severed

without becoming subsequently incrusted.
   That the incrustation was the result of superficial fusion seems the best explana-

tion of its presence on the meteorite, as well as of the partiality with which it was
distributed. Such a superficial fusion, however, could only result from the develop-

ment of heat of enormous temperature very instantaneously ; and the best if not
         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                          189

the only satisfactory solution seems to be that recognized by most physicists, namely,

that it is the result of the heat generated by the aerolite entering the earth's

atmosphere with the velocity of a cosmical body, and of that velocity being

reduced with a suddenness that brings down the motion of the aerolite to that of

a falling body in a few seconds of time. The light associated with the fall of such

a body is probably due in part, as llaidinger has suggested, to the actual ineandes-

cenceof the air, partly to the combustion of the iron and the ignition of the stony

material as the surface of the aerolite fuses and streams away in a state of ignition

and is thus left behind it in its path. The reports heard may be due to the actual

bursting of the mass into fragments, from the gradual penetration towards the

interior of the high temperature constantly being developed on its surface. That

interior, bringing with it the intense cold of space, and the contracted volume due

to that coldness" (probably also brittle in consequence of it), remains in its more

shrunk state, while the outer parts are expanding. Wherever there are lines of

weaker aggregation therefore in the mass, or where the heat is able, from differences

of conducting power in the material, to penetrate the mass unequally, a tendency

in parts of the mass to break away from an inner core will ensue, and the explosion

is the result. The causes that have combined to sever the mass into fragments

mav recur to cause explosions in the fragments, especially if their coherence has

been shaken and cracks have been formed in them. If the aerolite has not lost too

much of its velocity at the time of the explosions, the incrustation will recommence

on the fresh surfaces. Where the velocity has been too far reduced, this process

will not be repeated, and the stones will fall without a crust on the faces of fracture.

Intel-mediate stages of slight incrustation and even of a mere thin glazing are by

no means rare, and several of these are illustrated b}r specimens in the British

Museum.

Mr. Maskelyne next pointed out the conditions which must have been present

in the earlier stages of the history of an aerolite. The presence of an excess of iron

and a deficiency of oxygen is attested by the existence of metallic iron in almost

everv known aerolite. " One has to imagine a mixture of molten metals gradually

oxidizing in a rare atmosphere, and to suppose that the more oxidizable of them

take precedence in their claim to the oxygen. These have, probably, during the

process displaced some of the iron and nickel where these metals had become

alreadv combined, as in the cases where we find the iron isolated in the form of a

microscopic, often crystallized dust in the interior of aerolitic minerals (like the
Wesuboxide of copper in avanturine glass).
                                            have also evidence of stages in the

history of the formation of an aerolite. The orbicidar structure of so many of

these bodies is an indication of one stage of this kind. The spherules which cha-

racterize this structure are often composed of a single crystalline and homogeneous
mineral, with a radiating structure ; often they are breccias made up of several

crystals of the same or of different minerals united by a granular network of mineral.

These spherules are often surrounded by a shell of meteoric pyrites or iron, and

are set in a mixed mass, often highly porphyritic, composed of similar ingredients

with the spherules. The solidification of this ground-mass marks, probably, a second

stage in the history, the former indicating the very gradual separation by cooling

of some of the ingredients of the aerolite, and the latter the result of the further

gradual cooling of the residuary mass. There is no glass or uncrystallized matter

apparent in any aerolite yet examined. Hence the meteorite, while presenting

analogies with a slag in so" far as that it is produced in the presence of an excess of

metal, is in other respects analogous to a lava from the gradual manner in which

its cooling has taken place and the different minerals have become separated out.

A third stage in the history of the aerolite is exhibited in the veins of metallic

iron and of other substances which are so often found not only cementing the sides
of narrow fissures in meteorites, but frequently in the more compact varieties
traversing with those fissures the substance of the spherules, and producing in them
and the surrounding mass the phenomenon of "a heave," such as one sees in a

lode when the two sides of the fissures have shifted their relative positions.

The next subject introduced was that of the minerals contained in aerolites ; and

Mr. Maskelyne pointed out that, from the optical characters exhibited by these

minerals when under microscopic examination, he was led to believe that augite
--190 KEPORT 1862.

and felspar can rarely be detected in the high proportions in which they are asserted
by the chemist to be present in the chondritic variety of meteorite, though con-
stitutino- the mass of other kinds. In the former kind, on the other hand, the

crystals seem, in the majority of cases, to exhibit the planes of polarization in

directions which belong to minerals crystallizing in the prismatic system.

   The following meteorites, many of which had been recently acquired by the
British Museum, were next described in detail.

                         Chondritic Aerolites.

to have fallen on August 7, 1822, at a village in the neighbourhood of Agra, 300
miles N.~W. of Allahabad. Its sp. gr. =3666.

   10. 11. Two stones that fell, the one atk'mballah, at an uncertain date, in one of
the years 1822 or 1823, and the other at Bitoura, 75 miles N.W. of Allahabad, on

  A12. part of oue of the several stones that fell at Allahabad and Futtehpur on

the last date. These last four stones may all belong to one and the same fall : but if

the date of Mr. Nevill's Agra stone be correct, it is certainly a distinct one from

the other three. Its high specific gravity, its large amount of iron, and general

aspect would render it probable that it is so, which would confirm the correctness

of its date. The Umballah stone is very unlike either of the others, and is probably

a separate fall.

That from Bitoura certainly belongs to the fall of Allahabad and Futtehpur.

The sp. gr. of the Allahabad stones range from 3-54 to 357.

A13. small stone fell in the field called the North Inch, close to Perth, in Scot-
Aland, on May 17, 1830.
                         small portion of it was reserved by Dr. Thomson of

This very remarkable stone fell on July 26, 1843. It consists of a congeries of

beautiful primrose-yellow crystals entangled, as it were, in a network of an opake
mineral of the same colour.

   On the Effects of different Manures on the Mixed Herbage of Grass Land.
 By J. B. Lawes, F.B.S., F.C.S., and J. H. Gilbert, Ph.D., F.B.S., F.C.S.

   At the Aberdeen Meeting the authors had shown the great difference in both the
chemical and the botanical characters of the herbage induced by different kinds of
manure, each applied for three consecutive years on the same plot, in a portion of
Mr. Lawes's park, which had been laid down as meadow probably for some
centuries. Now, after the continuance of the experiment for four years niore, they
gave the results of a more complete botanical analysis of the produce. The full
details were exhibited in Tables, and discussed at length ; but the most important
of them are embodied in the Table given herewith, and the general results may be

shortly stated as follows :

    1. So far as the general distribution of Graminaceous, Leguminous, and miscella-
neous or weedy herbage, and the tendency to the production of leafy or stemmy
produce and to early or retarded ripening, were concerned, the characters of the
produce of the seventh season, 1862, were, in the main, similar to those before
recorded of the third season, 1858. But there was considerable change in the
relative predominance of certain species on particular plots. Dactylis glomerata,
Festuca duriuscula or F. pratensis, Avena pubescens or A. Jlavescens, Poa trivialis ot
P. pratensis, and Ahpecurus pratensis had, respectively, become much more preva-
lent on one or more of the plots, according to the description of manure employed.

   2. Unmanured, the mown produce consisted of 74 per cent, by weight of

Graminaceous, 7 per cent. Leguminous, and 19 per cent, miscellaneous or weedy
herbage. It showed great variety, comprising about 40 species of plants, of which
16 were Graminaceous, 4 Leguminous, and the remainder miscellaneous, and
exhibited comparatively little predominance of individual species. Festuca durius-
cula, F. pratensis, Avena pubescens, and A. Jlavescens were the most prominent;
whilst the freer-growing grasses were in smaller amoimt, and a number of others
in less proportion still. The crop was even, but very short, with little development
of stem ; and it was green, and comparatively late, at the time of cutting.

    3. Mixed mineral manures (superphosphate of lime, and sulphates of potass, soda,
and magnesia) also gave about 40 species of plants ; they increased the Graminaceous
herbage comparatively little, and reduced the proportion in the produce both of it
and the weedy herbage, but very greatly increased both the amount per acre and
the proportion of the Leguminous plants Trifolium, Lathyrus, and Lotus, which
together contributed nearlj' one-fourth of the total produce. The description of the
Graminaceous herbage was not very much altered from that of the unmanured land
there was no striking predominance of individual species ; but, compared with the
produce by more productive manures, there was a pretty even mixture of most of
the grasses occurring without manure, and those which did show any prominence
were chiefly of the smaller and less free-growing kinds. The tendency to form
stem and seed, and to early ripeness, was much greater than without manure.

   4. Ammonia salts alone gave a produce in which 33 species only were detected
 they considerably increased both the amount per acre and the proportion in the
produce of the Graminaceous herbage, almost excluded Leguminous plants, and
reduced the number and amount of miscellaneous or weedy species generally, but
much increased the luxuriance of some few, particularly the Pumex acetosa, Bunium
Jlexuosum, and Achillea millefolium. The proportions were nearly 88| per cent.

 Graminaceous, but a fraction of 1 per cent. Leguminous, and 11 f per cent, mis-
 cellaneous herbage. The relation to one another of the Graminaceous species, as

to amount, was much the same as without manure, excepting that Festuca durius-
 cula and Agrostis vtdgaris were brought into much greater prominence. The in-
--192 report 1862.

creased growth was characteristically that of root or base-leaves, and there was

very little tendency to form stem or to ripen.

    5. Nitrate of soda alone, like ammonia-salts alone, considerably increased the
produce of Graminaceous herbage, and tended chiefly to the production of root-

foliage. The nitrate, however, strikingly brought into prominence the Alopecurus

pratensis, at the expense, compared with the produce by ammonia-salts, chiefly of
Agrostis vulgaris, and partly of Festuca duriuscula. Otherwise the distribution of
species was not very materially altered, the more luxuriantly-growing grasses not
being much developed. The crop was much more leafy than stemmy, very dark

green, and late; it contained very little Leguminous herbage, though rather more

than the produce by ammonia-salts alone ; and the weedy plants were luxuriant
rather than numerous Plantago lanceolata, Centaurea nigra, Rumex acetosa, Achillea

millefolium, Ranunculus, and Taraxacum all being more or less encouraged.

   6. The combinations of nitrogenous-manured (ammonia-salts or nitrates) and the
mixed mineral manure gave by far the largest crops, the largest proportion of

Graminaceous herbage, the largest proportion referable to a few species, scarcely a
trace of Leguminous plants, and a small proportion, both in number and amount, of
miscellaneous or weedy plants. In fact, the totad number of species (particularly

when ammonia-salts were used) was smaller than by any other description of

manure, in one case only 21, and in another only 24, being detected ; and the Gra-

minaceous herbage in several cases amounted to 90 per cent, or more of the total
crop. The produce was very luxuriant, with a good development of stem and stem-
leaves, and a much greater tendency to ripen than when the ammonia-salts or

nitrates were used without the mineral manure. The predominating grasses were

the most bulky and free-growing ones, Dactylis ghmerata and Poa trivialis being

very prominent, and Arena pubescens or A. Jlavescem, Agrostis vulgaris, Lolium

perenne, and Holcus lanatus somewhat so. Festuca duriuscula, F. pratensis, Arrhe-

natherum avenaceum, Alojiecurus pratensis, Bromus mollis, and others, were almost

excluded.

   7. Farmyard manure considerably increased the growth of the grasses and of
some few weeds, particularly Rumex, Ranunculus, Buniiim, and Achillea, and reduced

that of clover and other Leguminous plants, more especially when used in com-

bination with ammonia-salts. It greatly encouraged the growth of the good grass

Poa trivialis, and of the bad one Bronms mollis, and, when in conjunction with

ammonia-salts, the Dactylis ghmerata. Under both conditions, Festuca duriuscula

and F. pratensis were nearly excluded, and Avena Jlavescens, A. pubescens, Agrostis

vulgaris, Lolium perenne, and ArrhenatJierum avenaceum were very much^ reduced.
The crops were upon the whole bulky, comparatively simple as to description of
herbage (not more than 28 species in all being detected), fairly luxuriant both in

stem and leaf, somewhat rough and coarse, and showed a tendency to unequal

ripeness.

8. Graminaceous herbage was only encouraged when nitrogenous manures were

employed                                                and  when  these  were  used  alone,  the  produce  was  very  leafy,  and  gene-
                                                     ;

rally (according to the amounts applied) the crop was very dark green and showed

comparatively little tendency to ripen; but when the nitrogenous manures were

used in conjunction with mineral manures, the Graminaceous produce was very

much more luxuriant, very much more stemmy, showed much more tendency to

ripen, and almost excluded other descriptions of herbage.

9. Leguminous herbage was almost entirely excluded whenever nitrogenous

manures were used in any quantity, whether in the form of ammonia-salts or

nitrates, alone or in combination with mineral manures, but somewhat less so with

nitrates than with ammonia-salts. Mineral manures alone, containing both potass
and phosphoric acid, greatly increased the growth of Leguminous plants, particularly

the perennial red clover and meadow vetchling. Farmyard manure, like artificial

nitrogenous manures, also, but in a less degree, much diminished the proportion of
the Leguminous herbage.

   10. Miscellaneous or weedy herbage was diminished in the number of species,
and in the frequency of occurrence, by every description of manure, but by exclu-

sively mineral manures less so than by any others. Nitrogenous manures, especially

in combination with mineral constituents, diminished the number and frequency

very strikingly, but at the same time greatly increased the luxuriance of a few

species, especially Rumex acetosa, and frequently Bunium Jlexuosum and Achillea
millefolium. Plantago and Ranunculus were generally discouraged by active ma-
nures, excepting farmyard manure and nitrate of soda. The nitrate also favoured

Centaurea nigra and Taraxacum dens-leonis.
   11. Considerable increase of produce was only obtained by means of farmyard

manure, or artificial manures containing both mineral constituents and ammonia-
salts or nitrates. The crops so obtained were much more Graminaceous, and con-
sisted in much greater proportion of but a few species of plants. The grasses

--developed were chiefly of the more bulky and freer-growing kinds, and the produce

was generally very stemmy the more so, and the coarser, the more excessive the

manuring.

   12. Meadow-land mown for hay should not be manured exclusively with

artificial manures, but shoidd receive a dressing of well-rotted farmyard manure

every four or five years.
   18. Sewage-irrigation, like active manures applied to nieadow-land in the ordi-

nary way, baa also a tendency to develope chiefly the Graminaceous herbage, ex-
cluding the Leguminous, and to a great extent the miscellaneous or weedy plants.

It also, at the expense of the rest, encourages a few free-growing grasses, among
which, according to the locality and other circumstances, Poa trivialis, Triticum

repens, Dactylis glomerata, Hoicus lanatus, and Lolium perenne have been observed
to be very prominent. The result is an almost exclusively Graminaceous and very
simple herbage. But as the produce of sewage-irrigated meadows is generally cut
or led off in a young and succulent condition, the tendency which the great
luxuriance of a few very free-growing grasses has to give a coarse and stemmy
later growth is less objectionable than in the case of meadows left for hay.

On the Past and Present Expenses and Social Condition of University Educa-
  tion. By the Rev. "W. Emery, B.D., Senior Felluw and Tutor of Corpus

   Christi College, Cambridge, late Senior Proctor of the University.

He traced the history from the earliest times, when Joffrid the Abbot of Croy-

land sent Gilbert and other three monks to Cottenham, who gave instruction in a

bam in Cambridge. It was not till ad. 1257 that St. Peter's, the first college in

the University, was founded, when the expense of a student ranged up to £2 a

year. The students then lived hard lives, Deing contented with a penny-piece of

beef amongst four, accompanied by salt and oatmeal only, and were obliged to run

up and down, " being without fire, in order to get a heat on their feet before going

to bed." The author then gave a very interesting and humorous account of the

provision for students in 1645, as stated by Strype in letters to his mother, written

from Jesus College. In 1763 expenses increased, tutorial charges increased, and

the system of private tutors was introduced. Fifty years since it might be gathered,

from the large number of noblemen an i fellow-commoners in the University, that

expenses had reached a much higher point, while, about thirty years back, extra-

vagance, immorality, and idleness had attained their utmost height. Since that

time a great improvement had taken place, and now there was a much better system

of habits, and a larger and more regular attendance on professional and college lec-

--tures. The estimates for the expenses of students at present for three terms a year

were on three scales the lowest being about £120, the second £180, and the highest

£250. If private tutors were engaged, a sum of £8 or £10 a term must be added, and

to those who resided in college in the long vacations an additional expense of £15

or £20 was incurred. Some men of great economy lived in the University for £100

a year. These rates included all University charges and private expenses as derived

from the tradesmen's bills sent in to the tutors. Some of the sizars had lived on

such low sums as £45 and £39 per annum. In most of the colleges the students

might obtain assistance from scholarships, the lowest stipend attached to which

would provide an undergraduate with a private tutor. It had been shown by evi-

dence that one of the sources of extravagance in undergraduates was the habits

acquired by them at public schools, and it was reasonable to suppose that a young

man who had expended from £200 to £300 a year at Eton or Harrow would not
Aspend less at Cambridge.
                           student might, however, pass creditably through his

course for £150 a year. The paper then dwelt on the social advantages derived

from membership and the welding together of classes in the University, and

stated that there was no town of equal extent and population that was more quiet

after half-past nine at night than Cambridge, while rioting and dissipation were

of limited extent, the larger number of students being economical and well-con-

ducted.
