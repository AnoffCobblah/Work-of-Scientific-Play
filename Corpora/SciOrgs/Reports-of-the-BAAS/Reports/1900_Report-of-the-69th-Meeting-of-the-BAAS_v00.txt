one of them appointed to act as Chairman, who shall have notified per-
sonally or in writing his willingness to accept the office, the Chairman to have
the respo7isihility of receiving and disbursing the grant (if any has been made)
and securing the presentation of the Seport in due time ; and, further, it is
expedient that one of the members should be appointed to act as Secretary, for

ensuring attention to business.

     That it is desirable that the number of Members appointed to serve on a
Committee shojild be as small as is consistent with its efficient icorking.

      That a tabular list of the Committees appointed on the recommendation
of each Section should be sent each year to the Recorders of the several Sec-
tions, to enable them to fill in the statement whether the several Committees
appointed on the recommendation of their respective Sections had presented

their reports.

      That on the proposal to recommend the appointment of a Committee for a

special object of science having been adopted by the Sectional Committee, the

number of Members of such Committee be then fixed, but that the Members to
serve on such Committee be nominated and selected by the Sectional Com-

mittee at a subsequent meeting.^

     Committees have power to add to their number persons whose assist-
ance they may require.

     The recommendations adopted by the Committees of Sections are to
be registered in the Forms furnished to their Secretaries, and one Copy of

each is to be forwarded, without delay, to the Assistant General Secretary
for presentation to the Committee of Kecommendations. Unless this be

--done, the Recommendations cannot receive the sanction of the Association.
     N.B. Recommendations which may originate in any one of the Sections

must first be sanctioned by the Committee of that Section before they can
be referred to the Committee of Recommendations or confirmed by the
General Committee.

                      Notices regarding Grants of Money. "^

1. No Committee shall raise money in the name or under the auspices of

          the British Association without special permission from the General
          Committee to do so ; and no money so raised shall be expended
           except in accordance with the Rules of the Association.

2. In grants of money to Committees the Association does not contem-
          plate the payment of personal expenses to the Members.

3. Committees to which grants of money are entrusted by the Association

           for the prosecution of particular Researches in Science are ap-

          pointed for one year only. If the work of a Committee cannot be
          completed in the year, and if the Sectional Committee desire the
          work to be continued, application for the reappointment of the
          Committee for another year must be made at the next meeting of

            the Association.

 4- Each Committee is required to present a Report, whether final or in-

           terim, at the next meeting of the Association after their appoint-

          ment or reappointment. Interim Reports must be submitted in
          writing, though not necessarily for publication,

5. In each Committee tlie Chairman ia the only person entitled to
          call on the Treasurer, Professor G. Carey Foster, F.R.S., for

         such portion of the sums granted as may from time to time be

             required.

6. Grants of money sanctioned at a meeting of the Association expire on
          June 30 following. The Treasurer is not authorised after that

           date to allow any claims on account of such grants.
7. The Chairman of a Committee must, before the meeting of the Asso-

           ciation next following after the appointment or reappointment of
          the Committee, forward to the Treasurer a statement of the sums
          ·which have been received and expended, with vouchers. The
           Chairman must also return the balance of the grant, if any, which
           has been received and not spent ; or, if further expenditure is con-

          templated, he must apply for leave to retain the balance.

8. When application is made for a Committee to be reappointed, and to

           retain the balance of a former grant which is in the hands of the
          Chairman, and also to receive a further grant, the amount of such
           further grant is to be estimated as being additional to, and not

            inclusive of, the balance proposed to be retained.

9. The Committees of the Sections shall ascertain whether a Report has
          been made by every Committee appointed at the previous Meeting

         to whom a sum of money has been granted, and shall report to the

           Committee of Recommendations in every case where no such

           report has been received.

10. Members and Committees who may be entrusted with sums of money

            for collecting specimens of Natural History are requested to re-
           serve the specimens so obtained to be dealt with by authority of

            the Association.

11. Committees are requested to furnish a list of any apparatus which

         may have been purchased out of a grant made by the Association,

           and to state whether the apparatus will be useful for continuing

             the research in question, or for other scientific purposes.

12. All Instruments, Papers, Drawings, and other property of the Asso-
          ciation are to be deposited at the Office of the Association when

           not employed in scientific inquiries for the Association.

                    REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

    tt&port of the Council for the Year 1898-99, presented to the General
              Committee at Dover on Wednesday, September 13, 1899.

The Meeting this year will be memorable from the fact that for the first

time in the history of the Association the time and place of meeting have
been fixed in conjunction with and in response to an invitation of the
French Association for the Advancement of Science, with the object of
affording an opportunity for the members of the sister Associations to
exchange visits and to participate in scientific discussions in their several
Sections. To carry out this intention, arrangements have been made for
our Association to receive a visit from the members of the French Asso-
ciation on Saturday, September 16, and the Association Francaise has, on
its part, invited the members of the British Association to pay a return
visit on the following Thursday, and has expressed a desire that some
of our members should join in an excursion to places of interest which has

been planned for the following days.
     The Council have to deplore the loss by death of Sir Douglas Galton,

who, for twenty-four years, occupied the responsible office of General
Secretary, a post which he resigned only on becoming President of the
Association in 1895, at the Ipswich Meeting. The Council desire to place
on record their sense of the invaluable services rendered by Sir Douglas
Galton to the Association.

     The Council regret to announce that a vacancy has been caused in the
list of Vice-Presidents for this meeting in consequence of the lamented
death of Lord Herschell.

    An invitation was received from the Vice-Chancellor of the University

of Cambridge to nominate a delegate to represent the Association at the
Jubilee of Sir George Gabriel Stokes, which was celebrated on June 1
and June 2. The President, Sir William Crookes, was apjaointed to
represent the Association, and to present the following Address :

           To Sir George Gabriel Stokes, Bart., D.CL., LL.D., F.R.S.

     The Council of the British Association for the Advancement of Science desire to
offer you their cordial congratulations on the completion of fifty years of your tenure of
the Lucasian Professorship in the University of Cambridge.

     You have been a JMember of the Association for more than half a centurj-, and
have served it in many capacities during that period. You were appointed Secretary
of the Section of Mathematical and Physical Science in 1845, and continued in this
laborious oiSce until 1851. In the two following years you were a Vice-President of
the Section, and became President in 1854 and again in 1862. Many times Vice-

President, you were President of the Association in 1869, at the meeting in Exeter,

and have been a permanent Member of the Council for the last thirty years.
      Your services to the Association, and to the cause for which it exists, are far

from being fully told by a mere enumeration of the offices you have held. In 1S52
you gave an Evening Lecture to the Members at the Belfast Meeting on a branch of
 Optics which has been chiefly elucidated by your own researches ; and from 1845,
the first year of your membership, till the meeting last year at Bristol, the Eei^orts
 of the Association have been enriched year by year by your contributions. Your
 celebrated reports on 'Researches in Hydrodynamics,' published in 1846, and on
 ' Double Refraction,' in 1862, are constantly referred to as classical writings by the
 cultivators of those branches of Physics, and have conferred abiding lustre on the
 publications of the Association.

       Of your other conspicuous services to the cause of Science it is almost needless to
        ----                --
                         :

speak, but your association with the Eoyal Society as Secretary for thirty-one years,
and subsequently as President, has given you a place which is without a parallel

among those who, during the last half-century, have fostered the progress of

Science.

    Tliat you may long continue among our leaders in the advance of knowledge is

the earnest desire of the Association.

     The following letter has been received from the Secretaries of the

lloyal Society ;

                                               The Royal Society, Burlington House, London, W.,
                                                                    November 29, 1S98.

  --Dear Sie, We are directed by the President and Council of the Pioyal Society

to inform you that a Committee, consisting of Fellows of the Royal Society acting
in conjunction with representatives of the Royal Geographical Society, was formed
some time since for considering the steps that should be taken for organising an
expedition to the Antarctic regions.

     As you are probably aware, an appeal to H.M. Government to organise such an
expedition has met with no encouragement, and the Royal Geographical Society has
consequently taken steps for raising a fund for the purposes of such an expedition
by private subscription. To this fund the Royal Society hopes to be able to con-
tribute through the medium of the Government Grant for Scientific Research, and at
a recent meeting of the Antarctic Committee the following resolutions were passed,
which we are directed to bring to your notice, and to request you, so far as they
concern the British Association, to lay them before the Council of that body at the

earliest opportunity

                ' (I) That the Treasurer of the Royal Society be requested to apply to the
          Government Grant Committee for a grant of 1,000Z. (payable in instalments),
          in aid of an Antarctic Expedition.

              ' (2) That an application be also made to the Council of the British Asso-
          ciation for a graht of 1,000L for the same purpose.'

                              We remain, tery faithfully yours,

                                                                                M. Foster,

                                                                  Arthur W, Rijcker,

                                                                                                                        Secretaries, R.S.

     The General Secretary of the British Association.

     After due consideration the Council have resolved to recommend the
General Committee to contribute the stlm of 1,000^. td the Nationjll
Antarctic Expedition, and that the grant be given out of tlie accumulated
funds of the Association, and not out of the sum allocated to annual

grants.

     The following resolutions, referred to the Council by the General
Committee for consideration and action if desirable, have been considered
and acted upon as follows :

     (1) That having tegard to the letter of December 15, 1897, from Sir
E. Maunde Thompson, the Council be requested to take further actioh
with regard to a Bureau of Ethnology, by renewing the correspondence
with the Trustees of the British Museum.

     The following statement, in response to a letter from the President,
has been received from Sir E. Maunde Thompson :

                                                                    British Museum, December 1, 1898.

   --Dear Sir, In reply to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the

establishment of an Ethnographical Bureau in connection witli the British Museum,
I beg to say that unforeseen delays in carrying out certain rearrangements affecting
space within our walls have hitherto prevented the Trustees from taking up the
matter. Now, however, a room has been found which may Serve as an office for
making a start with the scheme.
--

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  IXXXV

     But while the Trustees have accepted in principle the proposal, I beg to observe
that the desired end would scarcely be obtained without the influential co-operation

of the British Association, upon which I assume the Trustees may rely.
    May I then suggest that, as a preliminary step in maturing the scheme, one or

more members of the British Association should be appointed to confer with tho
officers of the British Museum as to the most advisable course to follow ?

    A Committee, consisting of the President, the President- Elect, the

General Officei'S, Mr. Francis Galton, and Professor Tylor, was accordingly
appointed for the purpose of conferring with the officers of the British
Museum, as proposed by Sir E. Maunde Thompson. The President has
also been in correspondence with the Marquess of Salisbury regarding this
matter, and the Council have the pleasure to announce that satisfactory
arrangements have been made for the establishment of such a Bureau,
and that Lord Salisbury has directed that reports prepared by officers in
the various Protectorates under the administration of the Foreign Office be
forwarded to the British Museum.^

     (2) That the Council be requested to consider the desirability of
representing to the Colonial Government that the early establishment of

a Magnetic Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope would be of the

highest utility to the Science of Terrestrial Magnetism, especially in view
of the Antarctic Expeditions which are about to leave Europe, and that
the Observatory should be established at such a distance from electric
railways and tramways as to avoid all possibility of disturbance from

them.

     The question having been considered, the Council requested the
President to make the necessary representation to the Colonial Govern-
ment, and the following letter was accordingly sent to Sir Alfred Milner,

--the High Commissioner and Governor of Cape Colony, for presentation

to the Government :

                                    British Association for the Advancement of Science,
                                                                    Burlington House, W., March 1899.

     Sir,--I have the honour to inform you that at the Annual Meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, held last September at Bristol, an
International Conference met for the purpose of discussing questions connected with
Terrestrial Magnetism. One of the resolutions, which was adopted by the Conference

--in the following terms, was referred to the Council of the Association for further

consideration :

                ' That the Council be requested to consider the desirability of representing
          to the Colonial Government that the early establishment of a Magnetic
          Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope would be of the highest utility to the
           Science of Terrestrial Magnetism, especially in view of the Antarctic Expedi-
           tions which are about to leave Europe, and that the Observatory should be
           established at such a distance from electric railways and tramways as to avoid
           all possibility of disturbance from them.'

      I have been requested by the Council to inform you that they have considered
this resolution, and have decided to transmit it to you for your favourable con-

 sideration.

      If you should require any further information in regard to this proposal, I shall
 be glad to furnish it.

                                                             I am, your obedient servant,
                                                                              "\ViLi.iAM Cbookes, President.

     The Council have received the following minute of the Government of
Cape Colony through the High Commissioner :

Ixsxvi       --REPORT 1890.

             Prime Minister's Office, Capo Town, May 13, 1899.

     Ministers have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of His Excellency the
Governor and High Commissioner's Minute, No. 71, of the 19th ultimo, forwarding
for their consideration a copy of a letter from Sir William Crookes, President of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, urging the establishment of a

Magnetic Observatory at the Cape.

In reply thereto, Ministers have the honour to state that they have much sym-

pathy with the suggestion to establish a Magnetic Observatory, and do not overlook

the scientific and practical aspects of the project, but do not regard as practicable

the immediate provision by this Colony of funds for the carrying out of the scheme.

                                   (Signed)  W. P. SCHREINBE.

     (3) That the Council be requested to consider the advisability of urging

Her Majesty's Government to place at the disposal of the Seismological

Committee of the British Association a suitable building for the housincr
of apparatus for continuous seismological observations.

   A Committee, consisting of the President, the President-Elect, the

General Officers, Professor Riicker, Professor Ewing, and Professor Judd,
was appointed to report on this resolution.

     The Committee, having received and considered a memorandum,
drawn up by Professor Milne, on the position and requirements of the
Seismological Investigation Committee of the Association, reported that

in their opinion it is desirable that a Central Station should be established,
and recommended the Council to request the Government to place a suit-
able building at the disposal of the Seismological Committee which could
be used as a station for carrying on observations, and would serve as a
centre for the stations (now twenty-three in number) in various parts
of the world which, at the request of the Committee, have been supplied
with seismographic apparatus of the pattern they have recommended.

     The Council decided to reaj^point the Committee for the purpose
of reporting further on the best situation for the proposed Central
Seismological Station, and on the cost of its maintenance.

     (4) That the Council be requested to urge strongly on the Indian
Government the desirability, in the interests both of administration and
of science, to promote an inquiry, under the direction of skilled anthro-
pologists, into the physical and mental characteristics of the various races
throughout the Empire, including their institutions, customs, and tradi-
tions, and a carefully organised photographic survey.

   A Committee, consisting of the President, the President-Elect, the

General Officers, Sir John Evans, Professor Tylor, Mr. F. Galton, Mr. C. H.
Read, and Mr. J. L. Myres, which was appointed to consider this question,

reported that in their opinion the resolution in its present form is of too

comprehensive and costly a character to justify the Council in submitting

Ait to th.e Indian Government.     more definite and less ambitious scheme

would in their opinion be more likely to be entertained by the Indian

Government.

     (.5) That the Council be recommended to issue the collected Reports
on the North-Western Tribes of Canada in a single volume at a moderate

price, i-eprinting so many of the Reports as may be necessary.

     The Council, having been informed that a sufficient number of separate
copies of the Fifth and the following Reports of the Committee on the
Nprth-Western Tribes of Canada were in stQck for supplying tliosp
--

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  Ixxxvil

Libraries, Public Institutions, and persons who required copies for com-

pleting sets, resolved that the Reports be not reprinted.

     (6) That the Council be requested to bring under the notice of the
Admiralty the importance of securing systematic observations upon the
Erosion of the Sea-coast of the United Kingdom, and that the co-opera-
tion of the Coastguard might be profitably secured for this purpose.

   A Committee, consisting of the President, the President-Elect, the

General Officers, Sir Archibald Geikie, Mr. Whitaker, Captain Creak,
Mr. A. T. Walmisley, and Professor L. Vernon Harcourt, having been
appointed to report on the above resolution, recommended that the Council
inquire whether the Admiralty would be willing to arrange that observa-
tions of a simple character on changes in the sea-coast be recorded and
reported by the Coastguards. The Committee pointed out that if the
Admiralty consented to carry out this proposal it would be necessary to
appoint a committee for the purpose of drawing up a scheme of instruc-
tions for the observers, making arrangements for starting the work, and

subsequently examining from time to time such localities as may seem to

require special attention. This recommendation having been adopted by
the Council, the President was requested to approach the Admiralty upon
the subject, and in response to his letter the following reply has been
received from the Admiralty :

                                                                               Admiralty, March 25, 3 899.

   --SlEj In reply to your letter of the 15th instant, inquiring if instructions can be

given to the Coastguard to watch and report any changes taking place round the

shores of the British Islands, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the

Admiralty to inform you that they see no objection to this proposal, as the required

observations can be made by the men in the ordinary course of their duty.
     On the receipt, therefore, of the instructions referred to in your letter, their

Lordships, if they concur in them, will cause them to be issued accordingly.
     Forms on which it is desired that the reports shall be made should also be drawn

up for communication to the Coastguard.
                                                                I am, sir, your obedient servant,
                                                                                  Evan Macgeegoe.

     The President of the British Association for the
                    Advancement of Science.

     The following have been appointed a Committee to carry out the
necessary arrangements as to the despatch of forms, the receiving and
tabulating reports, and such inspection of coast erosion or upheaval as

--may from time to time appear desirable, viz. : Sir Archibald Geikie,

Captain Creak, Professor L. Vernon Harcourt, Mr. \V. "VVhitaker, Mr.
A. T. Walmisley, and the General Officers.

      (7) That the Council be requested to take into consideration whether
any alterations in the hours of meeting of the Sectional Committees and
of the General Committee on the first day of the Annual Meeting of the
Association are desirable, and to report to the General Committee at the

Dover Meeting.

   A Committee, consisting of the President, the President-Elect, the

General Officers, Sir Douglas Galton, Mr. Francis Galton, Mr. A. G. Vernon
Harcourt, Professor Bonney, Professor Riicker, Professor Oliver Lodge,

Sir W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, Professor Herdman, Professor Hudson Beare,

and Dr. H. Forster Morley, was appointed to consider this resolution, and
as a result of their inquiries the Council has resolved to recommend to the

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE COUNCIL

              Bureau of Ethnology for Greater Britain

                                                      Foreign Office : May 24, 1899.

    Sib,-- I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to transmit to you the annexed

correspondence which has passed between this Department and the British Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science, respecting the establishment of a Bureau of
Ethnology for Greater Britain in connection with the British Museum, and the desire

of the Association to obtain from Her Majesty's Officers in the various Protectorates
under the administration of the Foreign Office information of an ethnological

character with respect to the numerous uncivilised races with whom they come in

contact.

    Lord Salisbury is of opinion that Her Majesty's Officers should be encouraged to
furnish information desired by the Bureau, so far as their duties will allow of their

doing so, and I am to request you to inform Officers under your administration

accordingly.

All reports which may be drawn up in answer to questions forwarded by the

Bureau should be forwarded under flying seal through the Foreign Office.

              I am, sir, your most obedient, humble servant,

                                     (Signed)         Martin Gosselin.

  --Sib, I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to transmit to you for your

Information, and for such effect as you may be able to give to the instructions ccn-
tained in it, a copy of a despatch which has been addressed to Her Majesty's Com-
missioners in the Uganda, and East and Central Africa Protectorates, and Her

Majesty's Consul-General in the Somali Coast Protectorate, on the subject of pro-

curing information for the Bureau of Ethnology which is about to be established iu

connection with the British Museum.

              I am, sir, your most obedient, humble servant,

                                     (Signed)         Maktin Goi33ELix.

     Letter from the President of the British Association to the Marquess

of Salisbury :

                                                                     Burlington House : March 30, 1899.

   My LOBD,--I have the honour to inform you that a proposal to establish a Bureau

of Ethnology for Greater Britain has been discussed at several recent meetings of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, and that the Council of the
Association were subsequently requested to consider the possibility of establishing

such a Bureau.
     The Council appointed a Committee to consider the proposal, and having adopted

the report of the Committee, requested the Trustees of the British Museum to allow
the proposed Bureau to be established in connection with that Institution. The

Trustees have expressed their willingness to undertake the working of the Bureau,

and the necessary space for its establishment has now been provided at Blooms-

 bury.

      In forwarding to your Lordship copies of the report of the Committee appointed
by the Council, I would desire to call special attention to the following paragraph
                                        :

--XC REPORT 1899.

viz. : ' The collecting of the necessary information for the Bureau could be done with

but little expense and with a very small stafE only, if the scheme were recognised and

forwarded by the Government. If instructions were issued, for instance, by the

Colonial Office, the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the Intelligence Branch of the

War Office, to the officers acting under each of these departments, not only that they

were at liberty to conduct these inquiries, but that credit would be given to them
officially for good work in this direction, there is little doubt that many observers
qualified by their previous training would at once put themselves and their leisure at

the disposal of the Bureau.'

If the proposed Bureau is to work successfully, it is necessary to have the ap-

proval and co-operation of the several Departments of the (rovernment concerned

with the primitive races to be dealt with. The Council have reason to believe that
a large proportion;of the officers now employed in dealing with these savage people

would gladly undertake scientific work of the character required by the Report, if

only they could be assured that such work would not be regarded unfavourably by

the authorities at home. There is reason to believe that such an impression exists,

but it is probably the result of some misunderstanding; and, in order to make the

matter quite clear, I would venture to ask from your Lordship an expression of

opinion favourable to the terms of the paragraph above quoted.

The Report itself gives in concise form a statement of the benefit likely to accrue

from the establishment of such a Bureau, as to the general principle of which I feel

sure the British Association may count upon your Lordship's entire sympathy.

                              I am, my Lord, your obedient servant,

                              (Signed)  William Cbookes, President.

                                               Inclosure 2.

     Report of the Committee appointed hy the Council to consider the

                  --folloioing Resolution

     ' That it is of urgent importance to press upon the Government the
necessity of establishing a Bureau of Ethnology for Greater Britain,
which, by collecting information with regard to the native races within,
and on the borders of, the Empire, will prove of immense value to science
and to the Government itself.'

   A central establishment in England, to which would come information

with regard to the habits, beliefs, and methods of government of the
primitive peoples now existing would be of great service to science, and
of no inconsiderable utility to the Government.

     1. The efforts of the various societies which have during the last
twenty years devoted themselves to collecting and publishing ethnological
information have necessarily produced somewhat unequal, and therefore
unsatisfactory, results. Such societies had, of course, to depend upon the
reports of exjolorers, who usually travelled for another purpose than that
in which the societies were interested ; and such reports were naturally
unsystematic, the observers being mostly untrained in the science. Again,
whole regions would be unrepresented in the transactions of the societies,
perhaps from the absence of the usual attractions of travellers, e.g. big
game or mineral riches. This has been to some extent corrected, at least
as to the systematic nature of the reports, by the publication of ' Anthro-
pological Notes and Queries ' by the Anthropological Institute, with the

help of the British Association.

    If it be admitted that the study of the human race is an important
branch of science, no further argument is needed to commend the

gathering of facts with regard to the conditions under which aboriginal

races now live, and, if this work is worth doing, it should be done without
REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  XCl

delay. With the excejitioii, perhaps, of the negro it would seem that
none of the lower races are capable of living side by side with whites.
The usual result of such contact is demoralisation, physical decline, and
steady diminution of numbers ; in the case of the Tasmanians, entire dis-

appearance. Such will probably soon be the fate of the Maories, the
Andamanese, the North American Indians, and the blacks of Australia.
While these exist it is possible to preserve their traditions and folk-lore,
and to record their habits of life, their arts, and the like, and such direct
evidence is necessarily more A^aluable than accounts filtered through the
recollection of the most intelligent white man.

     It is scarcely necessary to enlarge upon this point, as no one will
seriously question the value to science of such information. But it does

seem necessary to urge that no time be lost.

    2. As to the benefit to the Government of these inquiries, the history

of our relations with native tribes in India and the Colonies is rich in

examples. No one who has read of the ways of the African can doubt

that a thorough study of his character, his Ijeliefs and superstitions, is a

necessity for those who have to deal with him. And what is true of the

natives of Africa is also true, in a greater or less degree, of all uncivilised

races. Their ideas of common things and common acts are so radically
different from those of civilised man that it is impossible for him to

understand them without a special training.
     Even in dealing with the highly civilised natives of India it is most

necessary that an inquirer should be familiar with their religion, and

with the racial prejudices which the natives of India possess in common

with other civilised nations.

   A training in knowledge of native habits is now gone through by our

--officers, traders, and missionaries on the spot ; and by experience some-
--times dearly bought they, after many failures, learn how to deal with

the natives. By the establishment of such a Bureau as is here advocated
much might be done to train our officers before they go out, as is now

done by the Dutch Government, who have a handbook and a regular

course of instruction as to the life, laws, religion, &c., of the inhabitants

of the Dutch Indies. The experience thus gained would then mature
rapidly, and they would become valuable servants to the State more

quicklj'.

     The collecting of the necessary information for the Bureau could be
done with but little expense and with a very small staff" only, if the
scheme were recognised and forwarded by the Government. If instruc-

tions were issued, for instance, by the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office,

the Admiralty, and the Intelligence Branch of the War Office, to the

officers acting under each of these departments, not only that they were

at liberty to conduct these inquiries, but that credit would be given to

them officially for good work in this direction, there is little doubt that
many observers qualified by their previous training would at once put

themselves and their leisure at the disposal of the Bureau.
     The Bureau itself, the central office, would be of necessity in London

-- --in no other place could it jaroperly serve its purpose and preferably,

for the sake of economy and official control, it should be under the
administration of some existing Government office. But the various
interests involved make it somewhat difficult to recommend where it
should be placed. The Colonial Office would obviously present some

advantages. The British Museum has been suggested, with good reason,
                                                                                      --

--xcii
                                                                    REPORT 1899.

and there appears to be no insuperable difficulty if the trustees are willing

to undertake the responsibility of controlling such a department.
AThe staff wovild not be numerous.
                                                                                  director accustomed to deal

with ethnological matter would necessarily direct the conduct of the

inquiries, and until the material assumed large proportions two or three

clerks would probably suffice. If the value of the results were considered

to justify it, the increase of the area of operations over the world would

probably call for additional assistance after the Bureau had been at work

for a few years.

The Bureau of Ethnology in the United States aims chiefly at pub-

lishing its reports, but its area is limited to America. The scope of the

present proposal is so much wider that the Committee think it better not

to deal with the question of publication at present.

                                                                    Inclosuee 3.

Letter from the Foreign Office to the British Association .--

                                                                                  Foreign Office, April 7, 1899.

--Sir, I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to acknowledge the receipt of

your letter of the 30th ult, on the subject of the establishment of a Bureau of

Ethnology  for  Greater  Britain                                    and  I  am to request that you will inform his lord-
                                                                 ;

ship whether it is correctly understood that what the British Association for the

Advancement of Science desires, so far as this Department is concerned, is that Her

Majesty's officers in the various Protectorates administered under the Foreign Office

should report on occasion to the best of their ability on the ethnology of the various

native races in those Protectorates.

     If this be the correct interpretation of the wishes of the British Association,
Lord Salisbury would be obliged if some more precise definition can be furnished as
to the points to which attention should be directed, with a view to framing instruC'

tions for the guidance of the officers concerned.

                         I am, sir, your most obedient, humble servant,

                                                                            (Signed)  Martin Gosselin,

The President of the British Association for the
                Advancement of Science.

     Letter from tlie British Association to the Foreign Office ;

                                                     Burlington House, London, May 3, 1899.

     Sir,-- I have to acknowledge the receipt of the letter from Sir Martin Gosselin
of April 7, with regard to the proposed establishment of a Bureau of Ethnologj' for
Greater Britain in connection with the British Museum.

     The purpose of the British Association in applying to the Foreign Office has been
correctly understood so far that it is desired to obtain from the agents and officers
of the Foreign Office information of an ethnological character with respect to the

numerous uncivilised races with whom they come into daily contact.

     But it is not contemplated to give the Foreign Office any trouble in conducting
these inquiries. The officers of the Bureaa will prepare the questions and forward

them to the various officers, who, it is hoped, may be willing to furnish the answers.

All the material thus gathered will be systematically arranged in the British

Museum, so as to be available both for scientific research and for the purposes of
the Government.

     The Council of the British Association felt, however, that before entering into
communication with those officers it would be wise to ask for Lord Salisbury's
approval of the scheme, in order that the gentlemen who were disposed to undertake
such work as is contemplated by the Bureau might be assured that the work would
be favourably regarded by their Depa^rtmept.
                                                                               --

IREPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                                            XCiu

In the event, therefore, of the scheme meeting with the approval of Lord

SaUsbury I would venture to ask his lordship to be good enough to express this

approval in such terms that the letter can be used in opening the correspondence

with the agents of the Foreign Office.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

(Signed)                                          William Ckookes, President.

The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

quess of Salisbury to transmit to you for your information, copies of despatches which

Professor SIR :\IICHAEL FOSTER, K.C.B., Sec.R.S.
                                 PRESIDENT.

He who until a few minutes ago was your President said somewhere at

the meeting at Bristol, and said with truth, that among the qualifications

needed for the high honour of Presidency of the British Association for

the Advancement of Science, that of being old was becoming more and

more dominant. He who is now attempting to speak to you feels that he

is rapidly earning that distinction. But the Association itself is older

than  its  President                                        it  has seen pass away the men who, wise  in  their  gene-
                                                         ;

ration, met at York on September 27, 1831, to found it ; it has seen other

great men who in bygone years served it as Pi-esidents, or otherwise helped

it on, sink one after another into the grave. Each year, indeed, when it

plants its flag as a signal of its yearly meeting, that flag floats half-mast

high in token of the great losses which the passing year has brought.

This year is no exception ; the losses, indeed, are perhaps unwontedly

heavy. I will not attempt to call over the sad roll-call ; but I must say a
word about one who was above most others a faithful and zealous friend of

the Association. Sir Douglas Galton joined the Association in 1860. From

1871 to 1895, as one of the General Secretaries, he bore, and bore to the great

good of the Association, a large share of the burden of the Association's

work. How great that share was is perhaps especially known to the
many men, among whom I am proud to count myself, who during his long

term of office served in succession with him as brother General Secretary.

In 1895, at Ipswich, he left the post of General Secretary, but only to

become Piesident. So long and so constantly did he labour for the good of

the Association that he seemed to be an integral part of it, and meeting as

we do to-day, and as we henceforward must do, without Douglas Galton,
we feel something greatly missing. This year, perhaps even more than in

other years, we could have wished him to be among us ; for to-day the
Association may look with joy, not unmixed with pride, on the realisation

of a project in forwarding which it has had a conspicuous share, on the

                                                                                                          b2
--4 REPORT 1899,

commencement of an undertaking which is not only a great thing in itself,

but which, we trust, is the beginning of still greater things to come. And

the share which the Association has had in this was largely Sir Douglas

Galton's doing. In his Address as President of Section A, at the meeting of

the Association at Cardiff in 1891, Professor Oliver Lodge expounded with

pregnant words how urgently, not pure science only, but industry and the

--constructive arts for the interests of these are ever at bottom the same
-- needed the aid of some national establishment for the prosecution of

prolonged and costly physical researches, which private enterprise could

carry out in a lame fashion only, if at all. Lodge's words found an echo

in many men's minds ; but the response was for a long while in men's

minds only. In 1895, Sir Douglas Galton, having previously made a

--personal study of an institution analogous to the one desired namely, the
--Reichsanstalt at Berlin seized the opportunity offered to him as President

of the Association at Ipswich to insist, with the authority not only of the

head for the time being of a great scientific body, but also of one who

himself knew the ways and wants at once of science and of practical life,

that the thing which Lodge and others had hoped for was a thing which

could be done, and ought to be done at once. And now to-day we can

say it has been done. The National Physical Laboratory has been founded.

The Address at Ipswich marked the beginning of an organised effort which

Ahas at last been crowned with success.       feeling of sadness cannot but

come over us when we think that Sir Douglas Galton was not spared to

see the formal completion of the scheme whose birth he did so much to

help, and which, to his last days, he aided in more ways than one. It is

--the old story the good which men do lives after them.

Still older than the Association is this nineteenth century, now swiftly

drawing to its close. Though the century itself has yet some sixteen

months to run, this is the last meeting of the British Association which

will use the numbers eighteen hundred to mark its date.

The eyes of the young look ever forward ; they take little heed of the

short though  ever-lengthening  fragment  of  life which  lies  behind them
                                                                                                                            ;

they are wholly bent on that which is to come. The eyes of the aged

turn wistfully again and again to the past ; as the old glide down the

inevitable slope their present becomes a living over again the life which

has gone before, and the future takes on the shape of a brief lengthening

of the past. May I this evening venture to give rein to the impulses of
advancing years ? May I, at this last meeting of the Association in the

eighteen hundreds, dare to dwell for a while upon the past, and to call to

mind a few of the changes which have taken place in the world since those
autumn days in which men were saying to each other that the last of the

seventeen hundreds was drawing towards its end ?

     Dover in the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and ninety-nine

was in many ways unlike the Dover of to-day. On moonless nights men
"roped their way in its narrow streets by the help of swinging lanterns
ADDRESS.  5

and smoky torches, for no lamps lit the ways. By day the light of the

Sim struggled into the houses through narrow panes of blurred glass.
Though the town then, as now, was one of the chief portals to and from
the countries beyond the seas, the means of travel were scanty and dear,
 available for the most part to the rich alone, and, for all, beset with dis-
comfort and risk. Slow and uncertain was the carriage of goods, and the

--news of the world outside came to the town though it from its position
--learnt more than most towns tardily, fitfully, and often falsely. The

people of Dover sat then much in dimness, if not in darkness, and lived
in large measure on themselves. They who study the phenomena of living

beings tell us that light is the great stimulus of life, and that the fulness

of the life of a being or of any of its members may be measured by the

variety, the swiftness, and the certainty of the means by which it is in
touch with its surroundings. Judged from this standpoint life at Dover
then, as indeed elsewhere, must have fallen far short of the life of to-day.

     The same study of living beings, however, teaches us that while from

one point of view the environment seems to mould the organism, from
another point the oi'ganism seems to be master of its environment. Going

behind the change of circumstances, we may raise the question, the old

question. Was life in its essence worth more then than now ? Has there

been a real advance ?

    Let me at once relieve your minds by saying that I propose to leave
this question in the main unanswered. It may be, or it may not be, that

man's grasp of the beautiful and of the good, if not looser, is not firmer

than it was a hundred years ago. It may be, or it may not be, that man

is no nearer to absolute truth, to seeing things as they really are, than he

was then. I will merely ask you to consider with me for a few minutes
how far, and in what ways, man's laying hold of that aspect of or part of
truth which we call natural knowledge, or sometimes science, differed in

1799 from what it is to-day, and whether that change must not be
accounted a real advance, a real improvement in man.

    I do not propose to weary you by what in my hands would be the rash

effort of attempting a survey of all the scientific results of the nineteenth
century. It will be enough if for a little while I dwell on some few of

the salient features distinguishing the way in which we nowadays look upon,
and during the coming week shall speak of, the works of Nature around

--us though those works themselves, save for the slight shifting involved in
--a secular change, remain exactly the same from the way in which they

were looked upon and might have been spoken of at a gathering of

philosophers at Dover in 1799. And I ask your leave to do so.

     In the philosophy of the ancients, earth, fire, air, and water were
called ' the elements.' It was thought, and rightly thought, that a know-
ledge of them and of their attributes was a necessary basis of a knowledge
of the ways of Nature. Translated into modern language, a knowledge of
6 REPORT-- 1899.

these ' elements of old means a knowledge of the composition of the
atmosphere, of water, and of all the other things which we call matter, as
well as a knowledge of the general properties of gases, liquids, and solids,
and of the nature and effects of combustion. Of all these things our
knowledge to-day is large and exact, and, though ever enlarging, in some

respects complete. When did that knowledge begin to become exact ?

    To-day the children in our schools know that the air which
wraps round the globe is not a single thing, but is made up of two
things, oxygen and nitrogen,' mingled together. They know, again,

that water is not a single thing, but the product of two things,
oxygen and hydrogen, joined together. They know that when the air
makes the fire burn and gives the animal life, it is the oxygen in
it which does the work. They know that all round them things are
undergoing that union with oxygen which Ave call oxidation, and that

oxidation is the ordinary source of heat and light. Let me ask you to

picture to yourselves what confusion there would be to-morrow, not only
in the discussions at the sectional meetings of our Association, but in
the world at large, if it should happen that in the coming night some

destroying touch should wither ujs certain tender structures in all our
brains, and wipe out from our memories all traces of the ideas which

cluster in our minds around the verbal tokens, oxygen and oxidation.

How could any of us, not the so-called man of science alone, but even

the man of business and the man of j^leasure, go about his ways lacking

those ideas ? Yet those ideas were in 1799 lacking to all but a few.
     Although in the third quarter of the seventeenth century the light of

truth about oxidation and combustion had flashed out in the writings of
John Mayow, it came as a flash only, and died away as soon as it
had come. For the rest of that century, and for the greater part of
the next, philosophers stumbled about in darkness, misled for the most of
the time by the phantom conception which they called phlogiston. It was

not until the end of tlie third quarter of the eighteenth century that the new
light, which has burned steadily ever since, lit up the minds of the men
of science. The light came at nearly the same time from England and
from France. Rounding ofT the sharp corners of controversy, and joining,
as we may fitly do to-day, the two countries as twin bearers of a common
crown, we may say that we owe the truth to Priestley, to Lavoisier, and to
Cavendish. If it was Priestley who was the first to demonstrate the exist-
ence of what we now call oxygen, it is to Lavoisier we owe the true

conception of the nature of oxidation and the clear exposition of the full
meaning of Priestley's discovery, while the knowledge of the composi-
tion of water, the necessary complement of the knowledge of oxygen, came

to us through Cavendish and, we may perhaps add, through Watt.

      The date of Priestley's discovery of oxygen is 1774, Lavoisier's classic
memoir ' on the nature of the principle which enters into combination

           ' Sonje may already know that there is at least a third thing, argon.

with metals during calcination' appeared in 1775, and Cavendish's paper
on the composition of water did not see the light until 1784.

     During the last quarter of the eighteenth century this new idea of

oxygen and oxidation was struggling into existence. How new was the

idea is illustrated by the fact that Lavoisier himself at first spoke of that

which he was afterwards, namely in 1778, led to call oxygen, the name by
which it has since been known, as 'the principle which enters into combina-

tion.' What difficulties its acceptance met with is illustrated by the

fact that Priestley himself refused to the end of his life to grasp the
true bearings of the discovery which he had made. In the year
1799 the knowledge of oxygen, of the nature of water and of air, and
indeed the true conception of chemical composition and chemical
change, was hardly more than beginning to be, and the century had to

pass wholly away before the next great chemical idea, which we know by the

name of the Atomic Theory of John Dalton, was made known. We have

only to read the scientific literature of the time to recognise that a truth

which is now not only woven as a master-thread into all our scientific con-

ceptions, but even enters largely into the everyday talk and thoughts of
educated people, was a hundred years ago struggling into existence
among the philosophers themselves. It was all but absolutely unknown to
the large world outside those select few.

If there be one word of science which is writ large on the life of the

present time, it is the word ' electricity ' ; it is, I take it, writ larger than

any other word. The knowledge which it denotes lias carried its practical

results far and wide into our daily life, while the theoretical conceptions

Wewhich it signifies pierce deep into the nature of things.  are to-day

proud, and justly proud, both of the )niiterial triumphs and of the intel-

lectual gains which it has brought us, and we are full of even larger

hopes of it in the future.

At what time did this bright child of the nineteenth century have its

birth 1

He who listened to the small group of philosophers of Dover, who in

1799 might have discoursed of natural knowledge, would perhaps have

heard much of electric machines, of electric sparks, of the electric fluid,

and even of positive and negative electricity ; for frictional electricity had
long been known and even carefully studied. Probably one or more of

the group, dwelling on the observations which Galvani, an Italian, had

made known some twenty years before, developed views on the connection

of electricity with the phenomena of living bodies. Possibly one of them

was exciting the rest by telling how he had just heard that a professor

at Pavia, one Volta, had discovered that electricity could be produced,

not only by rubbing together particular bodies, but by the simple contact

of two metals, and had thereby explained Galvani's remarkable results.

For, indeed, as we shall hear from Professor Fleming, it was in that
8 REPORT-- 1899.

very year, 1799, that electricity as we now know it took its birth.
It was then that Volta brought to light the apparently simple truths
out of which so much has sprung. The world, it is true, had to wait

for yet some twenty years before both the practical and the theoretic
worth of Volta's discovery became truly pregnant, under the fertilising
influence of another discovery. The loadstone and magnetic virtues
had, like the electrifying power of rubbed amber, long been an old

story. But, save for the compass, not much had come from it. And

even Volta's discovery might have long remained relatively barren had
it been left to itself. When, however, in 1819, Oersted made known liis
remarkable observations on the relations of electricity to magnetism, he

made the contact needed for the flow of a new current of ideas. And it

is perhaps not too much to say that those ideas, developing durin"' the

years of the rest of the century with an ever- accelerating swiftness, have
wholly changed man's material relations to the cii-cumstances of life, and
at the same time carried him far in his knowledge of the nature of

things.

     Of all the various branches of science, none perhaps is to-day, none

for these many years past has been, so well known to, even if not under-

standed by, most people as that of geology. Its practical lessons have

brought wealth to many                                                                                               its fairy  tales  have  brought  delight  to  more  ;
                                                                                                                  ;

and round it hovers the charm of danger, for the conclusions to which it

leads touch on the nature of man's beginning.

In 1799, the science of geology, as we now know it, was struggling

into birth. There had been from of old cosmogonies, theories as to how

the world had taken shape out of primaeval chaos. In that fresh spirit

which marked the zealous search after natural knowledge pursued ia the

middle and latter part of the seventeenth century, the brilliant Stenson,

in Italy, and Hooke, in our own country, had laid hold of some of the

problems presented by fossil remains ; and Woodward, with others, had

laboured in the same field. In the eighteenth century, especially in its

latter half, men's minds were busy about the physical agencies determining

or modifying the features of the earth's crust ; water and fire, subsidence

from a primieval ocean and transformation by outbursts of the central

heat, Neptune and Pluto, were being appealed to, by Werner on the one

hand, and by Desmarest on the other, in explanation of the earth's pheno-

mena. The way was being prepared, theories and views were abundant,

and many sound observations had been made ; and yet the science of

geology, properly so called, the exact and proved knowledge of the suc-

cessive phases of the world's life, may be said to date from the closing

years of the eighteenth century.

     In 1783, James Hutton put forward in a brief memoir his ' Theory of
the Earth,' which in 1795, two years before his death, he expanded into a

book ; but his ideas failed to lay hold of men's minds until the century had
ADDRESS.  9

passed away, when, in 1802, they found an able expositor in John Play fair.
The very same year that Hutton published his theory, Cuvier came to
Paris and almost forthwith began, with Bronguiart, his immortal researches

into the fossils of Paris and its neighbourhood. And four years later, in

the year 1799 itself, William Smith's tabular list of strata and fossils
saw the light. It is, I believe, not too much to say that out of these
geology, as we now know it, sprang. It was thus in the closing years of
the eighteenth century that was begun the work which the nineteenth
century has carried forward to such great results. But at that time only
the select few had grasped the truth, and even they only the beginning of

it. Outside. a narrow circle the thoughts, even of the educated, about the

--history of the globe were bounded by the story of the Deluge though the

--story was often told in a strange fashion or were guided by fantastic

views of the plastic forces of a sportive Nature.

     In another branch of science, in that which deals with the problems

presented by living beings, the thoughts of men in 1799 were also very
different from the thoughts of men to-day. It is a very old quest,

the quest after the knowledge of the nature of living beings, one of the

earliest on which man set out ; for it promised to lead him to a knowledge

of himself, a promise which perhaps is still before us, but the fulfilment

of which is as yet far off. As time has gone on, the pursuit of natural
knowledge has seemed to lead man away from himself into the further-

most parts of the universe, and into secret workings of Nature in which

he appears to be of little or no account ; and his knowledge of the nature

of living things, and so of his own nature, has advanced slowly, waiting

till the progress of other branches of natural knowledge can bring it aid.

Yet in the past hundred years, the biologic sciences, as we now call them,

have marched rapidly onward.

   We may look upon a living body as a machine doing work in accord-

ance with certain laws, and may seek to trace out the working of the inner
wheels, how these raise up the lifeless dust into living matter, and let the
living matter fall away again into dust, giving rise to movement and heat.
Or we may look upon the individual life as a link in a long chain, joining

something which went before to something about to come, a chain whose

beginning lies hid in the farthest past, and may seek to know the ties
wliich bind one life to another. As wc call up to view the long series of
living forms, living now or Hitting like; shadows on the screen of the past,
we may strive to lay hold of the influences which fashion the garment of
life. Whether the problems of life are looked upon from the one point
of view or the other, we to-day, not biologists only, but all of us, have

gained a knowledge hidden even from the philosophers a hundred years

ago.

      Of the problems presented by the living body viewed as a machine,
some may be spoken of as mechanical, others as physical, and yet others
10 REPORT-- 1899.

as chemical, while some are, apparently at least, none of these. In the

seventeenth century William Harvey, laying hold of the central mechanism

of the blood stream, opened up a path of inquiry which his own age and

the century which followed trod with marked success. The knowledge of the

mechanics of the animal and of the plant advanced apace ; but the physical
and chemical problems had yet to wait. The eighteenth century, it is

true, had  its physics  and  its  chemistry                                         but, in relation  at  least  to  the
                                                                                 ;

problems of the living being, a chemistry which knew not oxygen and a

jDhysics which knew not the electricity of chemical action were of little

avail. The philosopher of 1799, when he discussed the functions of the

animal or of the plant involving chemical changes, was fain for the most

part, as were his predecessors in the century before, to have recourse to

such vague terms as ' fermentation ' and the like ; to-day our treatises on
physiology are largely made up of precise and exact expositions of the

j)lay of physical agencies and chemical bodies in the living organism. He

made use of the words ' vital force ' or ' vital principle ' not as an occasional,

but as a common, explanation of the phenomena of the living body. During

the present century, esjaecially during its latter half, the idea embodied

in those words has been driven away from one seat after another ; if we
use it now when we are dealing with the chemical and physical events of

life we use it with reluctance, as a deus ex machina to be appealed to

only when everything else has failed.

   -- --Some of the problems and those, perhaps, the chief problems of the

living body have to be solved neither by physical nor by chemical methods,

but by methods of their own. Such are the problems of the nervous

system. In respect to these the men of 1799 were on the threshold of

a pregnant discovery. During the latter part of the present century,

and especially during its last quarter, the analysis of the mysterious

processes in the nervous system, which issue as feeling, thought,

and power to move, has been pushed forward with a success conspicuous

in its practical, and full of promise in its theoretical, gains. That

Weanalysis may be briefly described as a following up of threads.

now know that what takes j^lace along a tiny thread which we call a

nerve-fibre differs from that which takes place along its fellow-threads,

that diff"ering nervous impulses travel along different nerve-fibres, and that

nervous and psychical events are the outcome of the clashing of nervous

impulses as they sweep along the closely-woven web of living threads of

Wowhich the brain is made.        have learnt by expei'iment and by observa-

tion that the pattern of the web determines the play of the impulses, and
we can already explain many of the obscure problems not only of nervous

disease, but of nervous life, by an analysis which is a tracking out the

devious and linked paths of nervous threads. The very beginning of this

analysis Avas iinknown in 1799. Men knew that nerves were the agents of

feeling and of the movements of muscles ; they had leai'nt much about what
this part or that part of the brain could do ; but they did not know that
                     ADDRESS,                                                                                                                                                                                                                           11

one nerve-fibre differed from another in the very essence of its work. It was

just about the end of the past century, or the beginning of the present

one, that an Enghsh surgeon began to ponder over a conception which,

however, he did not make known until some years later, and which did

not gain complete demonstration and full acceptance until still more years

had passed away. It was in 1811, in a tiny pamphlet published privately,

that Charles Bell put forward his ' New Idea ' that the nervous system was

constructed on the principle that ' the nerves are not single nerves possess-

ing various powers, but bundles of different nerves, whose filaments are

united for the convenience of distribution, but which are distinct in office

as they are in origin from the brain.'

Our present knowledge of the nervous system is to a large extent only

an exemplification and expansion of Charles Bell's ' New Idea,' and has

its origin in that.

If we pass from the problems of the living organism viewed as a

machine to those presented by the varied features of the different crea-

tures who have lived or who still live on the earth, we at once call to
mind that the middle years of the present century mark an epoch in

biologic thought such as never came before, for it was then that Charles
Darwin gave to the world the ' Origin of Species.'

That work, however, with all the far-reaching effects which it has had,

could have had little or no effect, or, rather, could not have come into

existence, had not the earlier half of the century been in travail preparing

for its coming. For the germinal idea of Darwin appeals, as to witnesses,

to the results of two lines of biologic investigation which were almost

unknown to the men of the eighteenth century.

To one of these lines I have already referred. Darwin, as we know,

appealed to the geological record ; and we also know how that record,

imperfect as it was then, and imperfect as it must always remain, has

since his time yielded the most striking proofs of at least one part of his

general conception. In 1799 there was, as we have seen, no geological

record at all.

Of the other line I must say a few words.

To-day the merest beginner in biologic study, or even that exemplar

of acquaintance without knowledge, the general reader, is aware that

every living being, even man himself, begins its independent existence as
a tiny ball, of which we can, even acknowledging to thr full the limits

of the optical analysis at our command, assert with confidence that in

structure, using that word in its ordinary sense, it is in all cases absolutely

simple. It is equally well known that the features of form which supply

the characters of a grown-up living being, all the many and varied features

of even the most complex organism, are reached as the goal of a road, at

times a long road, of successive changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                that the life of every being, from
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

other, like dissolving views, all so ordained that often the final shape

with which the creature seems to begin, or is said to begin, its life in the

world is the outcome of many shapes, clothed with which it has in turn

lived many lives before its seeming birth.

All or nearly all the exact knowledge of the laboured way in which each

living creature puts on its proper shape and structure is the heritage of

the present century. Although the way in which the chick is moulded in

the egg was not wholly unknown even to the ancients, and in later years

had been told, first in the sixteenth century by Fabricius, then in the seven-

teenth century in a more clear and striking manner by the great Italian

naturalist Malpighi, the teaching thus offered had been neglected or

misinterpreted. At the close of the eighteenth century the dominant

view was that in the making of a creature out of the egg there was no

putting on of wholly new parts, no epigenesis. It was taught that the

entire creature lay hidden in the egg, hidden by reason of the very trans-

parency of its substance, lay ready-made but folded up, as it were, and

that the process of development within the egg or within the womb was

a mere unfolding, a simple evolution. Nor did men shrink from accepting

--the logical outcome of such a view namely, that within the unborn

creature itself lay in like manner, hidden and folded up, its offspring also,

and within that again its offspring in turn, after the fashion of a

cluster of ivory balls carved by Chinese hands, one within the other.

This was no fantastic view put forward by an imaginative dreamer ; it

was seriously held by sober men, even by men like the illustrious Haller,

in spite of their recognising that as the chick grew in the egg some

changes of form took place. Though so early as the middle of the

eighteenth century Friedrich Caspar Wolff and, later on, others had

strenuously opposed such a view, it held its own not only to the close

of the century, but far on into the next. It was not until a quarter

of the present century had been added to the past that Von Baer made
known the results of researches which once and for all swept away the
old view. He and others working after him made it clear that each

individual puts on its final form and structure not by an unfolding of

pre-existing hidden features, but by the formation of new parts through

the continued differentiation of a primitively simple material. It was

also made clear that the successive changes which the embryo undergoes

in its progress from the ovum to maturity are the expression of

morphologic laws, that the progress is one from the general to the special,

and that the shifting scenes of embryonic life are hints and tokens of lives

lived by ancestors in times long past.

If we wish to measure how far off in biologic thought the end of tlie

last century stands, not only from the end but even from the middle of

this one, we may imagine Darwin striving to write the ' Origin of

WeSpecies' in 1799.  may fancy him being told by philosophers that one

group of living beings differed from another group because all its members
            ADDRESS.                            13

and all their ancestors came into existence at one stroke when the first-

born progenitor of the race, within which all the rest were folded up,

Westood forth as the result of a creative act.  may fancy him listening to

a debate between the philosopher who maintained that all the fossils strewn

in the earth were the remains of animals or plants churned up in the

turmoil of a violent universal flood, and dropped in their places as the

waters went away, and him who argued that sucli were not really the

' spoils of living creatui'es,' but the products of some playful plastic

power which out of the superabundance of its energy fashioned here

and there the lifeless earth into forms which imitated, but only imitated,

those of living things. Could he amid such surroundings by any flight

of genius have beat his way to the conception for which his name will ever

be known ?

    Here I may well turn away from the past. It is not my purpose, nor
as I have said, am I fitted, nor is this perhaps the place, to tell even in
outline the tale of the woi'k of science in the nineteenth century. I am

content to have pointed out that the two great sciences of chemistry and
geology took their birth, or at least began to stand alone, at tJie close of
the last century, and have grown to be what we know them now within

about a hundred years, and that the study of living beings has within

the same time been so transformed as to be to-day something wholly
different from what it was in 1799. And, indeed, to say more would be
to repeat almost the same story about other things. If our present know-

ledge of electricity is essentially the child of the nineteenth century, so

also is our present knowledge of many other branches of physics. And

those most ancient forms of exact knowledge, the knowledge of numbers
and of the heavens, whose beginning is lost in the remote past, have, with
all other kinds of natural knowledge, moved onward during the whole of
the hundred years with a speed which is ever increasing. I have said I
trust, enough to justify the statement that in respect to natural knowledge

a great gulf lies between 1799 and 1899. That gulf, moreover, is a two-

fold one : not only has natural knowledge been increased, but men have
run to and fro spreading it as they go. Not only have the few driven

far back round the full circle of natural knowledge the dark clouds of the

unknown which wrap us all about, but also the many walk in the zone of

light thus increasingly gained. If it be true that the few to-day are, in re-
spect to natural knowledge, far removed from the few of those days, it is also

true that nearly all which the few alone knew then, and much which even
they did not know, has now become the common knowledge of the many.

    What, however, I may venture to insist upon here is that the difference

in respect to natural knowledge, whatever be the case with other differ-

ences between then and now, is undoubtedly a difference which means
progress. The span between the science of that time and the science of

to-day is beyond all question a great stride onwards.
--14 REPORT 1899.

   We may say this, but we must say it without boasting. For the very

story of the past which tells of the triumphs of science bids the man of
science put away from him all thoughts of vainglory. And that by many

tokens.

     Whoever, working at any scientific problem, has occasion to study the
inquiries into the same problem made by some fellow-worker in the years
long gone hj, comes away from that study humbled by one or other of

two different thoughts. On the one hand he may find, wlien lie has
translated the language of the past into the phraseology of to-day, how

near was his forerunner of old to the conception which he thought, with

pride, was all his own, not only so true but so new. On the other hand,

if the ideas of the investigator of old, viewed in the light of modern know-
ledge, are found to be so wide of the mai-k as to seem absurd, the smile
which begins to play upon the lips of the modern is checked by the thought,

Will the ideas which I am now putting forth, and which I think explain

so clearly, so fully, the 25roblem in hand, seem to some worker in the far

future as wrong and as fantastic as do these of my forerunner to me ? In

either case his personal pride is checked. Further, there is written clearly

on each page of the history of science, in characters which cannot be
overlooked, the lesson that no scientific truth is born anew, coming by
itself and of itself. Each new truth is always the ofispring of something
which has gone before, becoming in turn the parent of something

coming after. In this aspect the man of science is unlike, or seems to be
unlike, the poet and the artist. The poet is born, not made : he rises up,
no man knowing his beginnings ; when he goes away, though men after
him may sing his songs for centuries, he himself goes away wholly, having
taken with him his mantle, for this he can give to none other. The man

of science is not thus creative ; he is created. His work, however great it

be, is not wholly his own ; it is in pai-t the outcome of the work of men
who have gone before. Again and again a conception which has made
a name great has come not so iiiuch by the man's own eftbi't as out of the
fulness of time. Again and again we may read in the words of some man

of old the outlines of an idea which in later days has shone forth as a great

acknowledged truth. From the mouth of the man of old the idea dropped

barren, fruitless ; the world was not ready for it, and heeded it not ; the
concomitant and abutting truths which could give it power to work were
wanting. Coming back again in later days, the same idea found the world
awaiting it ; things were in travail preparing for it ; and someone, seizing
the right moment to put it forth again, leapt into fame. It is not so much

the men of science who make science, as some spirit which, born of the
truths already won, drives the man of science onward and uses him to
win new truths in turn.

     It is because each man of science is not his own. master, but one of
many obedient servants of an imjsulse which was at work long before him,

and will work long after him, that in science there is no falling back. In

respect to other things there may be times of darkness and times of light,
there may be risings, decadences, and revivals. In science there is only
progress. The path may not be always a straight line, there may be
swerving to this side and to that, ideas may seem to return again and

again to the same point of the intellectual compass ; but it will always be

--found that they have reached a higher level they have moved, not in a

circle, but in a spiral. Moreover science is not fashioned as is a house,
by putting brick to brick, that which is once put remaining as it was put

to the end. The growth of science is that of a living being. As in the
embryo phase follows phase, and each member of the body puts on in

succession ditferent appearances, though all the while the same member,
so a scientific conception of one age seems to diflfer from that of a follow-
ing age, though it is the same one in the process of being made ; and as
the dim outlines of the early embryo, as the being grows, become more
distinct and sharp, like a picture on a screen brought more and more into

focus, so the dim gropings and searchings of the men of science of old are

by repeated approximations wrought into the clear and exact conclusions

of later times.

     The story of natural knowledge, of science, in the nineteenth century,

as, indeed, in preceding centuries, is, I repeat, a story of continued progress.

There is in it not so much as a hint of falling back, not even of standing
still. What is gained by scientific inquiry is gained for ever ; it may be
added to, it may seem to be covered up, but it can never be taken away.
Confident that the progress will go on, we cannot help peering into the
years to come and straining our eyes to foresee what science will become
and what it will do as they roll on. AVhile we do so, the thought must
come to us. Will all the increasing knowledge of Nature avail only to

--change the ways of man will it have no eflfect on man himself ?

     The material good which mankind has gained and is gaining through
the advance of science is so imposing as to be obvious to everyone, and
the praises of this aspect of science are to be found in the mouths of all.
Beyond all doubt science has greatly lessened and has markedly narrowed
hardship and suffering ; beyond all doubt science has largely increased
and has widely diffused ease and comfort. The appliances of science have
as it were, covered with a soft cushion the rough places of life, and that
not for the rich only, but also for the poor. So abundant and so promi-
nent are the material benefits of science that in the eyes of many these
seem to be the only benefits which she brings. She is often spoken of as
if she were useful and nothing more, as if her work were only to administer
to the material wants of man.

      Is this so 1

    We may begin to doubt it when we reflect that the triumphs of science

which bring these material advantages are in their very nature intellec-

tual triumphs. The increasing benefits brought by science are the results
--16 REPORT 1899.

of man's increasing mastery over Nature, and that mastery is increasingly

a  mastery of   mind                        it is an increasing power to  use  the  forces  of  what
                                         ;

we call inanimate nature in place of the force of his own or other creatures'

bodies ; it is an increasing use of mind in place of muscle.

   Is it to be thought that that which has brought the mind so greatly

into play has had no effect on the mind itself 1 Is that part of the mind

which works out scientific truths a mere slavish machine producing results

it knows not how, having no part in the good which in its working it

brings forth ?

   "What are the qualities, the features of that scientific mind which has

wrought, and is working, such great changes in man's relation to Nature ?

In seeking an answer to this question we have not to inquire into the
attributes of genius. Though much of the progress of science seems to

take on the form of a series of great steps, each made by some great man,

the distinction in science between the great discoverer and the humble

worker is one of degree only, not of kind. As I was urging just now, the
greatness of many great names in science is often, in large part, the great -
ness of occasion, not of absolute power. The qualities which guide one

man to a small truth silently taking its place among its fellows, as these go
to make up progress, are at bottom the same as those by which another
man is led to something of which the whole world rings.

   The features of the fruitful scientific mind are in the main three.

   In the first place, above all other things, his nature must be one whicli

vibrates in unison with that of which he is in search ; the seeker after

truth must himself be truthful, truthful with the truthfulness of Nature.

For the truthfulness of Nature is not wholly the same as that which man

sometimes calls truthfulness. It is far more imperious, far more exacting.

Man, unscientific man, is often content with 'the nearly 'and ' the almost.'

Nature never is. It is not her way to call the same two things which

differ, though the difi"erence may be measured by less than the thousandth

of a milligramme or of a millimetre, or by any other like standard of minute-

ness. And the man who, carrying the ways of the world into the domain

of science, thinks that he may treat Nature's differences in any otlier way

than she treats them herself, will find that she resents his conduct ; if he in
carelessness or in disdain overlooks the minute difference which she holds

out to him as a signal to guide him in his search, the projecting tip, as it

were, of some buried treasure, he is bound to go astray, and the more strenu-

ously he struggles on, the farther will he find himself from his true goal.

   In the second place, he must be alert of mind. Nature is ever making

signs to us, she is ever whispering to us the beginnings of her secrets ; the

scientific man must be ever on the watch, ready at once to lay hold of

Nature's hint, however small, to listen to her whisper, however low.

     In the third place, scientific inquiry, though it be pre-eminently an

--intellectual effort, has need of the moral quality of courage not so much

the courage which helps a man to face a sudden difiiculty as the courage
                                                                                                                                           ADDRESS.                                                     17

of steadfast endurance. Almost every inquiry, certainly every prolonged

inquiry, sooner or later goes wrong. The path, at first so straight and

clear, grows crooked and gets blocked ; the hope and enthusiasm, or even

the jaunty ease, with which the inquirer set out leave him and he falls
into a slough of despond. That is the critical moment calling for courage.

Struggling through the slough he will find on the other side the wicket-

gate  opening up  the real                                                                                                                 path                      losing heart  he will  turn  back  and add
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

one more stone to the great cairn of the unaccomplished.

     But, I hear someone say, these qualities are not the peculiar attributes

of the man of science, they may be recognised as belonging to almost every-
one who has commanded or deserved success, whatever may have been his
walk of life. That is so. That is exactly what I would desire to insist,
that the men of science have no peculiar virtues, no special powers. They

are ordinary men, their characters are common, even commonplace.
Science, as Huxley said, is organised common sense, and men of science
are common men, drilled in the ways of common sense.

For their life has this feature. Though in themselves they are no

stronger, no better than other men, they possess a strength which, as I

just now urged, is not their own but is that of the science whose servants

they are. Even in his apprenticeship, the scientific inquirer, while learn-

ing what has been done before his time, if he learns it aright, so learns it

that what is known may serve him not only as a vantage ground whence

to push off into the unknown, but also as a compass to guide him in his

course. And when fitted for his work he enters on inquiry itself, what a

zealous anxious guide, what a strict and, because strict, helpful school-

mistress does Nature make herself to him ! Under her care every inquiry

whether it bring the inquirer to a happy issue or seem to end in nou'dit

trains him for the next effort. She so orders her ways that each act

of obedience to her makes the next act easier for him, and step by step

she leads him on towards that perfect obedience which is complete mastery.

    Indeed, when we reflect on the potency of the discipline of scientific
inquiry we cease to wonder at the progress of scientific knowledge. The

results actually gained seem to fall so far short of what under such guid-

ance might have been expected to have been gathered in that we are fain

to conclude that science has called to follow her, for the most part, the

poor in intellect and the wayward in spirit. Had she called to her service
the many acute minds who have wasted their strength strugglin<^ in vain

to solVe hopeless problems, or who have turned their energies to thino^s

other than the increase of knowledge ; had she called to her service the

many just men who have walked straight without the need of a rod
to guide them, liow much greater than it has been would have been

the progress of science, and how many false teachings would the world

have been spared                                                                                                                           To men of science themselves, when they consider
                                                                                                                                        1

their favoured lot, the achieyernents of the past should serve not as a

boast, but as a reproach.

      1899.
18 REPORT-- 1899.

If there be any truth in what I have been urging, that the pursuit of

scientific inquiry is itself a training of special potency, giving strength to

the feeble and keeping in the path those who are inclined to stray, it is
obvious that the material gains of science, great as they may l)e, do not

Wemake up all the good which science brings or may bring to man.

especially, perhaps, in these later days, thi-ough the rapid development of

the physical sciences, are too apt to dwell on the material gains alone.

As a child in its infancy looks upon its mother only as a giver of good
things, and does not learn till in after days how she was also showing her
love by carefully training it in the way it should go, so we, too, have
thought too much of the gifts of science, overlooking her power to

guide.

Man does not live by bread alone, and science brings him more than

bread. It is a great thing to make two blades of grass grow where before

one alone grew ; but it is no less great a thing to help a man to come to a

Wejust conclusion on the questions with which he has to deal.  may

claim for science that while she is doing the one she may be so used as

to do the other also. The dictum just quoted, that science is organised

common sense, may be read as meaning that the common problems of life

which common people have to solve are to be solved by the same methods

by which the man of science solves his special problems. It follows that

the training which does so much for him may be looked to as promising

to do much for them. Such aid can come from science on two conditions

only. In the first place, this her influence must be acknowledged
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

she must be duly recognised as a teacher no less than as a hewer of wood

and a drawer of water. And the pursuit of science must be followed not

by the professional few only, but, at least in such measure as will ensure
the influence of example, by the many. But this latter point I need not
urge before this great Association, whose chief object dui'ing more than

half a century has been to bring Avithin the fold of science all who would
answer to the call. In the second place, it must be understood that the

traiiiing to be looked for from science is the outcome not of the accumula-
tion of scientific knowledge, but of the practice of scientific inquiry.

Man may have at his fingers' ends all the accomplished results and all

the current opinions of any one or of all the branches of science, and yet
remain wholly unscientific in mind ; but no one can have carried out even
the humblest reseai'ch without the spirit of science in some measure

resting upon him. And that spirit may in part be caught even without

entering upon an actual investigation in search of a new truth. The
learner may be led to old truths, even the oldest, in more ways than one.

He may be brought abruptly to a truth in its finished form, coming straight

to it like a thief climbing over tlie wall ; and the hurry and press of modern

life tempt many to adopt this quicker way. Or he may be more slowly
guided along the path by whicli the truth was reached by him who first
laid hold of it. It is by this latter way of learning the truth, and by this
                                    ADDliESS.                                            19

alone, that the learner may hope to catch something at least of the spirit

of the scientific inquirer.
     This is not the place, nor have I the wish, to plunge into the turmoil

of controversy ; but, if there be any truth in what I have been urging,
then they are wrong who think that in the schooling of the young science

can be used with profit only to train those for whom science will be the
means of earning their bread. It may be that from the point of view of

the pedagogic art the experience of generations has fashioned out of the
older studies of literature an instrument of discipline of unusual power,

and that the teaching of science is as yet but a rough tool in unpractised
hands. That, however, is not an adequate reason why scope should not
be given for science to show the value which we claim for it as an intel-
lectual training fitted for all sorts and conditions of men. Nor need the
studies of humanity and literature fear her presence in the schools, for if
her friends maintain that that teaching is one-sided, and therefore mis-

leading, which deals with the doings of man only, and is silent about the

works of Nature, in the sight of which he and his doings shrink
almost to nothing, she herself would be the first to admit that that
teaching is equally wrong which deals only with the works of Nature and
says nothing about the doings of man, who is, to us at least, Nature's

centre.

     There is yet another general aspect of science on which I would crave

leave to say a word. In that broad field of human life which we call
politics, in the struggle not of man with man, but of race with race,
science works for good. If we look only on the surface it may at first

sight seem otherwise. In no branch of science has there during these
later years been greater activity and more rapid progress than in that

which furnishes the means by which man brings death, suffering, and

disaster on his fellow-men. If the healer can look with pride on the

increased power which science has given him to alleviate human suffering

and ward off the miseries of disease, the destroyer can look with still
greater pride on the power which science has given him to sweep away
lives and to work desolation and ruin ; while the one has slowly been

learning to save units, the other has quickly learnt to slay thousands.

But, happily, the very greatness of the modern power of destruction is
--already becoming a bar to its use, and bids fair may we hope before
--long 1
          wholly to put an end  to  it             in  the  words  of  Tacitus,  though  in
                                                ;

another sense, the very preparations for war, through the cliaracter which

science gives them, make for peace.

Moreover, not in one branch of science only, but in all, there is a deep

undercurrent of influence sapping the very foundations of all war. As I

have already urged, no feature of scientific inquiry is more marked than

the dependence of each step forward on other steps which have been made
before. The man of science cannot sit by himself in his own cave weaving

                                                                                 c2
--20 REPORT 1899.

out results by his own efforts, unaided by others, heedless of what

others have done and are doing. He is but a bit of a great system, a

joint in a great machine, and he can only work aright when he is in due
touch with his fellow-workers. If his labour is to be what it ought to be,
and is to have the weight which it ought to have, he must know what
is bein" done, not by himself, but by others, and by others not of his own
land and speaking his tongue only, but also of other lands and of other
speech. Hence it comes about that to the man of science the barriei's of
manners and of speech which pen men into nations become more and more

unreal and indistinct. He recognises his fellow- worker, wherever he may
live and whatever tongue he may speak, as one who is pushing forward
 shoulder to shoulder with him towards a common goal, as one whom he

 is helping an'd who is helping him. The touch of science makes the whole

 world kin.

      The history of the past gives us many examples of this brotherhood of

 science. In the revival of learning throughout the sixteenth and seven-

 teenth centuries, and some way on into the eighteenth century, the
 common use of the Latin tongue made intercourse easy. In some respects
 in those earlier days science was more cosmopolitan than it afterwards
 became. In spite of the difficulties and hardships of travel, the men of
 science of different lands again and again met each other face to face,
 heard with their ears, and saw with their eyes what their brethren had to
 say or to show. The Englishman took the long journey to Italy to study
 there ; the Italian, the Frenchman, and the German wandered from one
 seat of learning to another ; and many a man held a chair in a country
 not his own. There was help, too, as well as intercourse. The Royal
  Society of London took upon itself the task of publishing nearly all the
  works of the great Italian Malpighi, and the brilliant Lavoisier, two years
  before his own countrymen in their blind fury slew him, received from

  the same body the highest token which it could give of its esteem.

        In these closing years of the nineteenth century this great need of

  mutual knowledge and of common action felt by men of science of different
  lands is being manifested in a special way. Though nowadays what is
  done anywhere is soon known everywhere, the news of a discovery being
  often flashed over the globe by telegraph, there is an increasing activity in

  the direction of organisation to promote international meetings and inter-

  national co-operation. In almost every science inqviirers from many lands

  now gather together at stated intervals in international congresses to
  discuss matters which they have in common at heart, and go away each
   one feeling strengtliened by having met his brother. The desire that in the
  struggle to lay bare the secrets of Nature the least waste of human energy

  should be incurred is leading more and more to the concerted action of

   nations combining to attack problems the solution of which is difficult

   and costly. The determination of standards of measurement, magnetic

   gurveys, the sohition of great geodetic problems, t}ie mapping of the
ADDRESS.  21

--heavens and of the earth all these are being carried on by international

organisations.

     In this and in other countries men's minds have this long while past
Ijcen j^roatly nio\cd by the desire to make fresh ellbrts to pierce the dark
secrets of the forbidding Antarctic regions. Belgium has just made a
brave single-handed attempt ; a private enterprise sailing from these
shores is struggling there now, lost for the present to our view ; and this
year we in England and our brethren in Germany are, thanks to the
promised aid of the respective Governments, and no less to private
liberality, in which this Association takes its share, able to begin the
preparation of carefully oi'ganised expeditions. That international amity

of which I am speaking is illustrated by the fact that in this country and in

that there is not only a great desire, but a firm purpose, to secure the
fullest co-operation between the expeditions which will leave the two

shores. Tf in this momentous attempt any rivalry be shown between the
two nations, it will be for each a rivalry, not in forestalling, but in assist-

ing the other. May I add that if the story of the past may seem to give

our nation some claim to the seas as more peculiarly our own, that claim
bespeaks a duty likewise peculiarly our own to leave no effort untried by

which we may plumb the seas' yet unknown depths and trace their yet
unkiiown shores 1 That claim, if it means anything, means that when

nations are joining hands in the dangerous work of exploring the un-
known South, the larger burden of the task should fall to Britain's share ;
it means that we in this country should see to it, and see to it at once,
that the concerted Antarctic expedition which in some two years or so
will leave the shores of Germany, of England, and, perhaps, of other lands,
should, so far as we are concerned, be so equipped and so sustained that

the risk of failure and disaster may be made as small, and the hope of

being able not merely to snatch a hurried glimpse of lands not yet seen,

but to gather in with full hands a rich harvest of the facts which men not

of one science only, but of many, long to know, as great as possible.
     Another international scientific effort demands a word of notice. The

need which every inquirer in science feels to know, and to know quickly,
what his fellow- worker, wherever on the globe he may be carrying on his
work or making known his results, has done or is doing, led some four

years back to a proposal for carrying out by international co-operation
a complete current index, issued promptly, of the scientific literature

 of the world. Though much labour in many lands has been spent
 upon the undertaking, the project is not yet an accomplished fact. Nor
 can this, perhaps, be wondered at, when the difficulties of the task are

 weighed. Difficulties of language, difficulties of driving in one team all
 the several sciences which, like young horses, wish each to have its head

 free with leave to go its own way, difficulties mechanical and financial of

--press and post, difficulties raised by existing interests these and yet

 other difficulties are obstacles not easy to be overcome. The most striking
22 REPORT-- 1899.

and the most encouraging features of the deliberations which have now

been going on for three years have been the repeated expressions, coming

not from this or that quarter only, but from almost all quarters, of an

earnest desire that the effort should succeed, of a sincere belief in the

good (Jf international co-operation, and of a willingness to sink as far as

possible individual interests for the sake of the common cause. In the

face of such a spirit we may surely hope that the many difficulties will

ultimately paSxS out of sight.

Perhaps, however, not the least notable fact of international co-opera-

tion in science is the proposal which has been made within the last two years

that the leading academies of the world should, by representatives, meet

at intervals to discuss questions in which the learned of all lands are

Ainterested.  month hence a preliminary meeting of this kind will be

held at Wiesbaden ; and it is at least probable that the closing year of

that nineteenth century in which science has played so great a part may

--at Paris, during the great World's Fair which every friend, not of

science only, but of humanity, trusts may not be put aside or even injured

through any untoward event, and which promises to be an occasion not

of pleasurable sight-seeing only, but also, by its many international con-

--gresses, of international communing in the search for truth witness the

first select Witenagemote of the science of the world.

I make no apology for having thus touched on international co-

operation. I should have been wanting, had I not done so, to the memorable

Aoccasion of this meeting.      hundred years ago two great nations were

grappling with each other in a fierce struggle, ^\'hich had lasted, with

pauses, for many years, and was to last for many years to come ; war was

on every lip and in almost every heart. To-day this meeting has, by a

common wish, Jieon so arranged that those two nations should, in the
persons of their men of science, draw as near together as they can, with

nothing but the narrow streak of the Channel between them, in order

that they may take counsel together on matters in which they have one
interest and a common hope. May we not look upon this brotherly
meeting as one of many signs that science, though she works in a silent

manner and in ways unseen by many, is steadily making for peace ?

      Looking back, then, in this last year of the eighteen hundreds, on the

century which is drawing to its close, while we may see in the history of
scientific inquiry much which, telling the man of science of his short-
comings and his weakness, bids him be humble, we also see much, perhaps
more, which gives him hope. Hope is indeed one of the watchwords of
science. In the latter-day writings of some who know not science, much
may be read which shows that the writer is losing or has lost hope in the

future of mankind. There are not a few of these ; their repeated utter-

ances make a sign of the times. Seeing in matters lying outside science
few marks of progress and many tokens of decline or of decay, recognising

in science its material benefits only, such men have thoughts of despair
when they look forward to the times to come. But if there be any truth

in what I have attempted to urge to-night, if the intellectual, if the moral

influences of science are no less marked than her material benefits, if, more-

over, that which she has done is but the eai-nest of that which she shall do,

such men may pluck up courage and gather strength by laying hold of her

Wesrarment.  men of science at least need not share their views or their

fears. Our feet are set, not on the shifting sands of the opinions and of the

fancies of the day, but on a solid foundation of verified truth, which by the

labours of each succeeding age is made broader and more firm. To us the

past is a thing to look back upon, not with regret, not as something which

has been lost never to be regained, but with content, as something whose

influence is with us still, helping us on our further way. With us, indeed,

the past points not to itself, but to the future ; the golden age is in front

of us, not behind us ; that which we do know is a lamp whose bi-ightest

beams are shed into the unknown before us, showing us how much there

Weis ahead and lighting up the way to reach it.  are confident in the

advance because, as each one of us feels that any step forward which he

may make is not ordered by himself alone and is not the result of his own

sole eflbrts in the present, but is, and that in large measure, the out-

come of the labours of others in the past, so each one of us has the sure

and certain hope that as the past has helped him, so his efforts, be they

great or be they small, will be a help to those to come.

TiiK Corresponding Societies' Committee of the British Association
beg leave to submit to the General Committee the following Report.

     The Committee have pleasure in being able to state that the resolution

passed at the Bristol Conference of Delegates last year, respecting the
desirability of securing the co-operation of the Coastguard for carrying on
.systematic observations on Coast Erosion, having been adopted by the

British Association, has been favourably received by the Admiralty. The
Committee were informed that the Council of the British Association
appointed a Committee to consider and report on the proposal. The
Committee having reported favourably, the Council approached the
Admiralty, and in their Report give an account of their application.

     The necessary forms, prepared by the Committee of the Council, have

been issued by the Admiralty. Many have already been returned, filled
in by the Coastguard. As a knowledge of their nature may be useful to
the Corresponding Societies, and may tend to promote uniformity in the
observations made by such of their members as are interested in Coast

Erosion, copies of Forms I. and II. are appended.
     The Committee regi-et to have to report that the East of Scotland

Union of Naturalists' Societies (which was founded in 1884) has ceased to

--exist. The Secretary of the Union, in reply to inquiries as to the cause

of its dissolution, replied : I' think that the chief reason of the downfall

of this Union is that the majority of those men who originally founded
it and who took an active part in its work are now dead, and that those

left do not see the same necessity for combined work.' He added that

many of the smaller societies which belonged to the Union perished
through the decease of the older members and the want of a supply of
new ones from the younger people.

    Itistnictions to Observers hi regard to Changes that are taking place along the
                                              Coast-line of the British Isles.

     1 Mention the part of the coast on which j-ou report, and give its limits.
     2. State whether the coast is clifEy or low ; whether rocliy, sandy, gravelly, or
muddy. If it is cliffy, give the average height of the cliffs, and, if possible, the
nature of the material of which they consist, especially whether hard rock, chalk,
clay, &c. State also the nature of the beach.
    3. What is the vertical range of ordinary spring-tides ?
     4. Is the sea encroaching on the coast ? If so, state brioUy the proofs of this

change.
     5. Is the land gaining on the sea? If so, give shortly the evidence of such

advance.
     G. Are there any artificial causes which tend to increase or retard the natural

changes on the coast? For instance, are there any groynes along the shore, and if
so, what effect have they on the travelling shingle or sand ? Are the shingle, sand,
or slabs of stone, removed for industrial or other purposes 1

         Instructions to Observers in regard to Changes that may take place

                                  along the Coast-line of the British Isles.

    A. When changes are actually observed to be taking place on the coast, either a;5

to advance or retreat of the sea, it is very desirable that information regarding them
should be forwarded as soon as possible. For example, when auj' fall of a portion of
shore cliflE occurs, note of the circumstances should be taken, with measurements
(if that be found practicable) or estimates of the area or amount of material that

has been dislodged. When any groynes or other artificial protections of the coast
are washed away, this should also be reported, and likewise when any new groynes

or other works on the coast are constructed.
     B. The Council of the British Association will be glad to receive any other

information of which the observer may be in possession, bearing upon the changes

that are taking place along the shore.

--,30 EEroKT 1899.

                         First Covference, Dover, September 14, 1899.

     The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Rev.
T. E,, R. Stabbing (Chairman), Rev. J. O. Bevan, Mr. G. J. Symons,

Professor W. W. Watts, and Mr. T. V. Holmes (Secretary).

     The Report of the Corresponding Societies Committee (see p. 27), a
copy of which was in the hands of every delegate present, was taken as read.

     After briefly calling attention to the forms for recording observations
of coast changes, a result of the discussion on Coast Erosion at the Bristol
Conference, the Chairman delivered the following Address :

The Living Siibterranean Fauna of Great Britain and Ireland.

It would have been easy to enlarge the subject of this address and

extend its interest by omission of the word ' living,' and joining the flora

to the fauna. All the province of the palaeontologist would thus have been

included, and we should have been free to discuss the distribution of trufiles

and pio-nuts. But better results may be hoped for from a more restricted
Weambition. The cave-bear must be passed over with a fond regret.
                                                                   are

concerned only with animals still living. If among vertebrates we have to

content ourselves with birds and bats and rats, with badgers and foxes and

rabbits and moles, and in general a group of creatures not prominent for

size or ferocity, there ai-e compensations which none but a ^-ery ardent

spoi-tsman will despise. Our country is too much overrun by that digging,

delvinf, and destructive species, homo sapiens, to allow us any hope of

turninc up a Neomylodon (or Glossotherium), or even a mudfish. The

animals above-mentioned are of course only in a modified sense subtei"-

ranean. They seek their shelters or make them in caves or holes of the

earth but are still both free and forced to come abroad for various pur-

poses into the light of day or beneath the nocturnal sky.

    Like so many other terms applied to natural knowledge, the word

' subterranean ' is highly indefinite. How much earth must I put on my

head and how long must I keep it there to make me truly a Troglodyte 1

There is the giant Enceladus, whose uneasy turnings cause, as you know,

the eruptions of Mount Etna, under which he is permanently imprisoned.
From him, then, the conception of an underground animal may vary to

Virgil's an<^ry bees lulled for a few moments by the sprinkling of a hand-

ful of dust. Under loose stones a crowd of creatures take refuge, frame
their dwellinf'S, lay snares, and in various ways make themselves at home.

Amon" the.se are vipers and lizards, ants and bees and beetles, centipedes,

spidei's, and woodlice, with slugs and other slimy and seductive specimens

to suit almost every imaginable taste. Of burrowing spiders, none in Great
Britain has yet been found making a door to its trap. Whether the dis-

credit attaches to the British spider's want of ingenuity or to the British

arachnologist's want of research is still an open question. As to the dis-

tribution of the mole cricket, of the bee that burrows in footpaths, and

the history of mining insects in general within our islands, there may still

be information worth gleaning. The soils they favour, the temperatures

they can endure, their modes of working, their means of subsistence, the
good and the evil they do to mankind are among the obvious points of

interest connected with them. One has, however, to remember that

entomolo<^y is a science with innumerable students, a boundless literature,

and an infinite subject. There is, therefore, always a risk that in suing for

its assistance one may suffer the fate of the husbandman who, in a drou^lit,

incautiously prayed to Jupiter for rain, without specifying the quantity

required, and presently had to swim for his life from his flooded farm.

      There is the same chance of a surplus, of having, so to speak, rather too
much of a good thing, were we to take into our survey all those marine

specie.s which on the shore or in the sea hide under stones or bury them-
selves in sand and ooze-- sea-anemones and sand-eels, annelids and amphi-

pods, sea-urchins and starfishes, cockles and razor-shells, friends and foes,

the blind and the seeing, the brilliant and the dull, the agile and the slow

a list that might be extended into details of inexhaustible interest, but

interminable length.

     From these fields of research, so well known and so bewilderingly wide,
I turn to one which is by comparison exceedingly small and obscure, to

onewhich has certainly not been overworked or exhausted in this country

to one, moreover, in which the organisation of affiliated societies might

easily render essential service. The animals which are born and bred and

pass their lives in wells and caverns may be regarded as the true under-
ground fauna. Though in wells they may have no ground actually overhead,

still they live far below the surface, and, whether in well or cave, they are

the permanent occupants, distinct from those creatures which scuttle in and
out, and do most of their lighting, feeding, and foregathering in the external

world.

     The first undoubted mention of an underground crustacean seems to be
that of an amphipod found in London, and named by Dr. Leach of the
British iluseum in 1813, nor in earlier times do any important researches
appear to have been made as to the subterranean fauna of any part of the
globe. But, whatever the novelty and narrowness of the subject may be,
there are now scores of valuable treatises upon it, in a variety of European
languages, Polish and others. In the long list of authors one may note
in passing the names of Fries and Gustav Joseph, Wrzeonisowski and
Vejdovskiand Moniez, leaving the majority to be discovered in two admir-
able works, of which the English student will be well advised to make
himself master. One of these is ' The Cave Fauna of North America,' by
Dr. Alpheus Spring Packard, published in the ' Memoirs of the National
Academy of Sciences,' vol. iv., Washington, 1888. The other is 'The

Subterranean Crustacea of New Zealand,' by Dr. Charles Chilton, pub-

lished in the 'Transactions of the Linnean Society of London for 1894.'
      Packard enumerates 308 European cave animals and 102 American.

This total of 410 includes a few Protozoa, a sponge, two hydi-as, a few
worms, one mollusc, several Crustacea and myriapods, numerous arachnids
and a host of Coleoptera, the other insects being chiefly Thysanura. The
 vertebrates are limited to four American fishes and one European
batrachian, the celebrated Proteus anguineus. In the specific names of
 these animals there are, as might be expected, abundant references to

 their peculiar choice of residence, as in the designations cavaficns, cavicola.

 camcolens, cavernarum, speluncarnm, and, with more particularity,
 iryaadottensis, nickajackensis, manunothia, not to speak of the blood-
 curdling stygius, orcinus, and infernalis. To the colouring, or, rather,

 want of colouring in many of them, the epithets alhus, jxvlHdus, niveus,
 pellucidus, bear their testimony. To the feature, or, rather, want of feature,

 which in cave animals has attracted more attention than anything else,
 notice is called in several of the generic as well as the specific names, as in
 TyphHchthys and Amhhjopsis, the blind fishes, in Adelovs, Aphcenops, and
32 REPORT-- 1899.

Anophthalmus, eyeless genera of beetles. To the locality, or, rather,

want of locality, which in these lists more immediately concerns ourselves,

attention is directed only by a single name. As our inquiring eyes

scrutinise the European assemblage, and take note of the famous caverns

and countries through which this fauna is distributed, we find mention of

France and Germany, of Hungary and Spain, of Italy and Sicily, but

never a word of England. Only a veiled allusion occurs in the entry,

without specified locality, of the name Niphargus subterraneus (Leach).

So far as Dr. Packard's list is concerned, the explanation is simple, in that

the species in question has not been recorded from any English cavern,

though it belongs to the spelaean fauna of the Continent. To put a better

face upon the affair, it may be stated that the well fauna of England and

Ireland includes four species of Amphipoda, though even this quartette

was audaciously reduced to a single species by De Rougemont. From the

deep recesses of a disused coal mine near Glasgow Tinea ustella was
Arecorded by John Scott in 1850.
                                  copepod has been described by Dr.

G. S. Brady from a Northumbrian coal mine. Whether coal mines any
more than coal cellars can properly be included among caverns, we need

not now pause to inquire. Unless the entomologists can come to the

rescue with a goodly supply of cave-dwelling beetles and spring-tails, the

subterranean fauna of Great Britain and Ireland will perhaps never prove

to be rich in numbers. Still, when records are collected and investiga-

tions extended, we may reasonably hope that the balance of over three

hundred ac'ainst us in the European catalogue will be seriously diminished.

Since the scientific history of lite below ground may be said to have begun

in England, it should be our pride to take what share we can in the

sequel. In the last fifty years, and moi-e especially in the last twenty, a

series of remarkable forms have been discovered in subterranean waters

in various parts of the world. Even since Dr. Chilton's paper appeared

in 1894 many curious additions have been made to the well fauna

of North America, such as the woodlouse, HajdojjJitlialmus puieus,

described by Mr. P. Hay, from an old well in Indiana, and the

Sphceroma thermophilum, described by Miss Harriet Richardson, from

a warm spring in New Mexico, the one genus belonging to the land

and the other to the sea, and neither of them having till recently been

thought of in connection with fresh water, either hot or cold. In

1896 ' the United States Fish Commission completed an artesian

well at San Marcos, Texas. The depth of the well is 188 feet. The flow
of water obtained amounts to more than 1,000 gallons per minute. The
water is pure and of excellent quality, and has a temperature of 73°
Fahrenheit.' To these interesting particulars Mr. James E. Benedict, of

the U.S. National Museum, adds information v/hich reminds one of the
two f^irls in the fairy tale, with pearls and rubies falling from the lips of

the one and toads and lizards from the lips of the other, only that here
the rewards are not distributed but combined. For not only is the water
pure and excellent, but it delights the zoologist by sending up from the
bowels of the earth isopods, amphipods, piviwiis, and salamanders. The
species are all liUnd. The species are all now. The specimens arc

vilentiful. The salamander has oddities of its own. The isopod has

almost no excuse for not being marine. The prawn has eye-stalks, but
they are totally devoid of ocular pigment. There is a theory that at one
time the f^lobe was overspread with a blind fauna, the remnants of which
have been preserved in deep -^^ters and dark holes, whither creatures
                             CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.              33

endowed with sight have as a rule not cared to follow them, It would
be interesting to know how that theory explains the eye-stalks of a sight-

less prawn. But this is verging on the controversial, and it will be more

encouraging to research, if you will l^elieve, to begin with, that, whether

you are Darwinians or Neolamarckians or advocates of special creation,

you will tind support for your several opinions iu the prizes and surprises

that the subterranean fauna of every land, continental or insular, is

capable of yielding.

     The research suggested is not without difficulties, but they are not
such as need daunt the brave explorers of British caverns, who have
hunted down the sabre-toothed tiger and the prehistoric hyjena with
candle and torch and pick-axe. The difficulties in .searching for speci-

mens of well fauna are partly moral and partly physical. Many wells in

our country have, for sound reasons, been entirely closed. That in itself

is a barrier to collecting specimens from them, but, according to my

experience, the closure of some has indirectly barred the investigation of
others. The distribution of the well shrimp {Nij)harg^i>>) is known for
the neighbourhood of Dublin and for the whole south of England from
Devonshire to Kent. Yet for years I inquired for it in vain, though

using a pertinacity something like that imputed to the fair Saracen, who,

in the story, by constantly asking for London and for Gilbert, found her
way all across Europe to her affianced lover, and, marrying Gilbert a
Becket, became the mother of St. Thomas of Canterbury. Like hers,

my perseverance was in the end rewarded ; but, in the meantime, some
met my inquiry with smiles, and some with frowns. I am inclined to

suspect that the smiling ones were under a real incapacity of understand-
ing what sort of object was being asked for, but that the frowning set

understood pi'etty well, and that they took me for an inspector in dis-

guise, seeking, under pretence of an idiotic enthusiasm, for evidence out

of their own mouths on which to order the closing of their favourite

spring. It is obvious that, if such was their point of view, they com-

pletely misjudged my motives, for evidence, so far as it goes, all favours

the belief that the springs in which crustaceans are found living supply
water that is wholesome.

     In some inti'oductory remarks I assumed that our Conference, though
not a Section of the Association, was in fact an epitome of the whole.

If now I conclude by inviting the members of the Conference to go
·shrimping with a bucket and a string, it may appear to bo a terrible

example of bathos. Bathos has ever been exposed to derision in connec-
tion with poetry and eloquence. But bathos has been otherwise called
the art of sinking, and that art is profoundly essential in connection
with wells.

It will be indeed extraordinary if the caverns and springs and artesian

borings in Great Britain and Ireland do not yield, to a united effort of

investigation, a fauna in some degree comparable in interest with that

which, under similar circumstances, has been and is being found in other

pnrts of the globe. It will be extraordinary if the research, whatever its

direct results, does not stimulate, in many of those who pursue it, highly

pleasurable and profitable activities both of body and mind. At the

wonst, if the old proverb may be trusted, while groping for creatures at

the bottom of a well, you will always have the chance of combining two

enjoyments,  fishini-r  for  amnhinods   and  findin-g  Truth.

34 REPORT--1899.

On the conclusion of his Address, the Cliairman, in answer to a question

as to the best way of catching the well shrimp, replied that it was best to

wait till the well was almost empty, and then to let down a bucket and

withdraw it as quickly as possible, lest the creatures, being scared, should

have time to get away. Sometimes well shrimps were brought up when

pumping was going on.

    Rev. J. O. Bevan said that he had visited the Mammoth Cave of

Kentucky, where he saw a great many bats which had apparently passed

the whole of their lives within the cavern.

     The Chairman felt inclined to agree with the late Mr. Cordeaux, M'ho

--had stated that in many caverns bats and birds alternated the birds

going out when the day came and the bats going in. It was, liowever, a

matter of opinion.

    Mr. T. Workman had never seen birds in the Mammoth Cave of Ken-

tucky, though he had caught bats there by day, and he thought they lived

in the cave only in the daytime. They were not found in the depths of

the cave, though they were in great numbers near the mouth. He asked

tlie Chairman if the eyeless fishes found in caves belonged to any special

species ; also if the wells mentioned in connection with well shrimps
were open wells ?

     The Chairman replied that all the blind species were special. There

was a blind tish in caverns in Cuba. He included wells of all kinds. All

along the south of England, in Dublin, and, he believed, in Jersey, there

were records of these amphipods. Four species of well shrimps could be

obtained, and he thought that if England were searched more thoroughly

a greater number of species would be found.

Mr. Hotblack thought that there was no evidence then existing of

bats which spent all their time in caverns. Consequently they should

Anot be classed as subterranean fauna.  member of the Society he repre-

sented not long ago brought to one of their meetings a well shrimp

obtained at Norwich. All would probably agree with him in believing

that these well shrimps did not get into a well from its mouth, but from

underground water percolating into the well.

     Mr. Mark Stirrup said that some few years ago a society was started

in Yorkshire for cavern exploration, with which the search for subter-

ranean fauna might well be combined. The subject appeared to have

attracted more attention in America than in England, perhaps because

the underground waters in the great caverns of America had been more

productive. The Chairman doubtless wished the delegates to bring the

subject before the Societies they represented. He had certainly opened

out for them a new held of research.

The Chairman remarked that two gentlemen had written to him on

this subject, Mr. E. S. Goodrich, of the Department of Comparative

Anatomy, Oxford, who would be glad to liave any specimens of blind

Crustacea from wells and caves for experimental purposes, and Dr. Charles

Chilton (to whose work on the underground fauna of New Zealand he

had referred in his paper), who was living in Edinbui-gh. Dr. Chilton

was collecting particulars of the English well amphipods, and would be

glad of specimens.

Mr. Hotblack asked whether either of the gentlemen mentioned would

name specimens and return them.

The Chairman thought that they would be only too glad to do it.

Mr. William Gray expressed the hope that in the Report of the Con-
                                              CORRESPOXDIXG SOCIETIES.                       35

ference the Chairman's address would he printed in full. And Mr.

Hotblack suggested that proof copies should be supplied to the delegates,
so tliat they might bring the subject before their Societies at an early
date. Both propositions received the unanimous support of the meeting.

                     Second Meeting of the Conference, September 19.

     The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Rev. T.

11. R. Stebbing (Chairman), Dr. Garson, Mr. G. J. Symons, Professor W.

AV. Watts, and Mr. T. N. Holmes (Secretary).
     The Chairman opened the proceedings by reading the following letter,

which he had received since their last meetin*go :

                                   Eeception Koom, British Association: September 18, 1809.

   --SiR,^ -A feeling by quite a number of those interested in the work of

Delegates at our British Association Meetings, exists, that the interchange
of ideas regarding the organisation and development of the Local Societies
is not offered an opportunity of being discussed at the Conference of
Delegates at yearly meetings of the British Association. I should feel

inuch obliged if, as Chairman of our Conference, you could set aside a few
minutes for a discussion on ' the working by sections of large scientific
Societies, whether in Exact or Natural History Science ' at our meeting
on Tuesday the 19th inst.

                                                     I am, yours faithfully,
                                                           (Signed) G. P. Hughes, F.R.G.S.,

                                        Representing the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club.

   A long and desultory debate then followed, in which many delegates

present took part, as to the best ways of making the meetings of the
Conference moi'e useful than they now are. While it was proceeding

Mr. Stebbing was obliged to leave, and Professor AV. W. Watts became
Chairman. At length it was decided that the best course would be for

individual delegates to send their views to the Corresponding Societies
Committee not later than the first week in November. Letters received

by that date would be considered by the Committee when they met latei-
in that month. And, as some delegates were not present, it was thought
desirable that the Secretary should write, stating that this discussion had
taken place, and that any recommendations from delegates must be sent
in by the date mentioned.

    Mr. Hugh Blakiston, the Secretary of the ' National Trust for Places

of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty,' then read a paper on the aims
and work of the Trust.

Mr. Blakiston remarked that the National Trust was founded in the

year 1894 by the Duke of Westminster, the Earl of Carlisle, Lord

Hobhou.se, the Right Hon. James Bryce, Sir Robert Hunter, ]Miss

Octavia Hill and others, and was incorporated as a Limited Liability

Company ' to promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit of the

nation, of lands and tenements (including buildings) of beauty or historic

interest                             and  as  i-egards  lands, to  preserve (so far  as  practicable) their
                                  ;

natural aspect, features, and animal and plant life ; and for this purpose

to accept, from private owners of property, gifts of places of interest or

                                                                                         D2

l)eauty, and to hold the lands, houses, and other property thus acquired,

in trust for the use and enjoyment of the nation.' The Memorandum of

Association also declares that no property thus acquh-ed shall be dealt
with, in the event of the dissolution of the Trust, in a manner inconsistent

with the objects of the Trust.
      ]Mr. Blakiston then touched upon the wealth oE the Bi-itish Isles in

buildings of historic interest, and on the non-existence here of a Minister of
State one of whose functions was their preservation, though a Minister
for this purpose existed in Austria, France, and Italy. The extraordinary
growth in size of our towns during the reign of Queen Victoria had made
the last fifty years a peculiarly disastrous peiiod as regards the destruction
of ancient monuments, apart from such destruction as altered circum-

stances had made inevitable. And our larger cities tended more and

more to be divided into a central more ancient part, made up chiefly of
shops, offices, and eating-houses, thronged only by day, and monotonous
modern suburbs in whicli the bulk of tlie inhabitants slept and passed
their leisure time. Children, therefore, to a much greater degree than in
earlier periods, were brought up v,'ith little or nothing around them to
stimulate their imaginations, or to help them to realise the history of the

past. And these islands were looked upon as ' home ' by millions of

people scattered over the face of the earth, who might fairly expect to
find that the ancient monuments existing onl}- in the centre of the British
Empire were carefully preserved by those dwelling around them.

     Mr. Blakiston then referred to some of the work already done by the
National Trust during its short life. It had purchased Barras Head
opposite Tintagel Castle, and a most beautiful clitF overlooking Barmouth
had been presented by a lady to the Trust. Toys' Hill near ()xted,
Kent, and Ide Hill in the same district had also been acquired. The
purchase and restoration of the old Clergy House at Alfriston, Sussex,
and of Joiner's Hall, Salisbury, had secured to tlie nation two fine speci-
mens of medijeval domestic architecture. The Falkland monument on the

battlefield at Newbury was also under the care of the Trust. And it had

recently purchased in Wicker Fen, Cambridgeshire, a piece of the primi-
tive fenland, which will remain for ever undrained and untouched, with
its original plant and animal life.

     Turning to the question of further developments, he remarked that
tlie task before them was one which could not be achieved either by a
national society acting by itself or by local societies acting by themselves.

No central society could possess the full and complete information in a

given case which some local society possessed, nor could it influence local

feeling to the same degree. On the other hand, no local society is so

fully in touch with Parliament, or can appeal to so large a public as a

gi'eat central society. Coming to practical details, the two important
points were the creation of local committees to watch over the ancient
monuments of each county or district, and the formation of a central
fund. The Trust experienced much difficulty in obtaining timely informa-
tion, and thought that a federation of local societies would provide
machinery to obviate this difficulty. The creation of a central fund
would enormously strengthen the hands of the federated societies, by
enabling their representatives to purchase, or make grants towards the

purchase of properties of national interest. "With a small subscription

and a large membership a very considerable sum might be raised, from
which .orants could be made in local cases as occasion arose. The details
CORKESrJNDING SOCIETIES.  37

of the scheme would, of course, require careful consideration, and he
would be glad to receive any suggestions rcgaiding them fi-om members

of the Conference.

       Mr. Gray said that in Belfast they had endeavoured to prevent a

 syndicate from enclosing the Giant's Causeway. The syndicate, however,

 prevailed, and railed in the Causeway. On appealing to the National

 Trust they received a grant of 5/., and were now 1,500^. in debt, i;^ ...w<

       Mr. Blakiston remarked that his society was a very young one, and

 not in a position to make a large grant. Had they possessed sufficient

 funds they would have bought the Causeway.

      Mr. Gray rejoined that he had mentioned the matter to show the

 desirability of giving more adequate support to the Trust.

       Dr. Abbott hoped that every delegate present would mention the use-

 fulness of the Trust to his society, and that it would gain many addi-
 tional supporters. He wished, also, that people would get into the way of
 leaving money to the Trust.

      Mr. Blakiston remarked that the authorities of the Trust were going
 to make a proposal for federation to the natural history and archaeologi-

 cal societies of the country, probably during next month.

     Rev. H. H. Winwood inquired what constituted membership of the
Trust, and Mr. Vaughau Cornish asked to what extent the aims and

 objects of the National Trust were those of the other societies.
      Mr. Blakiston replied that thei-e was another society for the protection

of ancient buildings, which was almost entirely composed of architects.
It had no power to hold buildings, as the National Trust could, and could
intervene only when an ancient building was in danger of being injured.
The National Trust was in close touch with the society, also with the

Commons Preservation Society, the Selborne and other societies. He did

not think there was any fear of overlapping as regards the work of these

societies.

     The Chairman proposed a hearty vote of thanks to Mr. Blakiston for

his paper. He regretted that the discussion at the beginning of the

meeting had occupied so much time, and was sure that they had since

found out that it would have been better spent in listening to Mr.

Blakiston, who had put before them things which might profitably engage

the attention of all local societies.

   A vote of thanks having been heartily accorded to Mr. Blakiston, the

Chairman inquired if there were any representatives of the various
Sections present wishing to bring some subject before the delegates.

                                                 Section A.

     Mr. G. J. Symons, representing Section A, said that the Committee
for Seismological Observations were badly in want of a home, and
would be very glad if some ancient building could be allotted to them.

                                                  Section C.

     The Chairman, representing Section C, could mention two investi-
gations in which the local societies had been of much assistance. The
Committee to investigate the Erratic Blocks of the British Isles presented
a. Report this year. The Committee for the Collection, Preservation, and
Systematic Registration of Photographs of Geological Interest, of wbaoh
38 KEPOKT-- 1899.

he was secretary, would be glad to receive any contributions of such
photographs. The Committee hoped to be able to undertake the publica-
tion of typical geological photographs in such a way as to render them
easily obtainable by those who could make good use of them. It would
greatly help the Committee if local societies would agree to purchase a
series of these photographs. There was also a duplicate collection ot
prints and lantern slides which could be sent to any local society
wishing to exhibit them and to see what kind of work was being done,
the only expense incurred by the society being that of carriage. They
proposed, when publishing the photographs, to add letterpress descrip-

tions.

                                                  Section D.

      Rev. T. R. R. Stebbing, representing Section D, said that the secretary
of that Section recommended the study of the fauna of wells and ca\ern&
by the Corresponding Societies.

                                                Sectiox K.

     Mr. H. Wager, representing Section K, had to inform the delegates
of the Corresponding Societies that the Section had appointed a Com-
mittee to consider the geographical distribution of mosses, a matter of

interest to all the local societies.

     Mr. Yaughan Cornish thought that the Corresponding Societies

might congratulate themselves on the result of the discussion, at the
Conference of Delegates last year, on Coast Erosion, initiated by Mr.
Whitaker. Seldom, if e^ er, had the Admiralty been induced to act so
promptly as in their consent to the co-operation of the Coastguard as
observers of Coast Erosion.

     Dr. Garson hoped that the delegates would come to Bradford ne.vt
year well primed with any scheme of Mork they might wish .sliould be
taken up the following year at Glasgow. The meeting then came to
un end.

ON RADIATION FROM A SOURCJO OF LIGHT I\ A MAGNETIC FiKLI). G3

--li'ndudiun froni a Source vf LiijJit in, a Magnetic Field. PreUminari/

      Rejiort of the Committee, condsting of Professor Geoikjk Francis

     FitzGerald (Chairman), Thomas Preston (Secretari/), Professor

     A. Schuster, Professor 0. J. Lodge, Professor tS. P. Thompson,

    Dr. Gerald Molloy, and Dr. W. E. Adeney.

TiiK work undertaken by this Committee has not yet terminated. This
occurs partly from the difficulties which arose in obtaining a satisfactory
supply of electric current with which to excite the powerful electro-magnet
now in the hands of the Committee, and partly from the circumstance
that the Secretary was not always free to work at svTch times as the staft
of the Royal University found it convenient to permit I'esearch work in

the Physical Laboratory.
      Considerable advance has been made, howevei-, during the past session,

and the magnetic perturbations of the spectral lines of several substances
have been observed and photographed from one end to the other of the

Aspectrum. considerable amount of work remains to be done in this direc-

tion still, and this we hope to complete in the near future.
     The chief points of interest determined by the Committee since its

appointment are as follows :

1. On Friday, September 9, 1898, Professor S. P.Thompson attracted

the attention of the British Association (see ' Brit. Assoc. Report, 1898,'

p. 789) to an elegant experiment devised by Professor Righi for the

purpose of illustrating the absorption of light in a magnetic held. This

experiment was stated by Professor Righi to succeed only when the light

traversed the field along the lines of force, but it appeared to us from

theoretical considerations that similar absorption should also take place

when the light traverses the field across the lines of force. On trying the

experiment on the following Tuesday (September 13, 1898), it was found

at once that the experiment was capable of demonstrating absorption

across the lines of force ' as markedly as that ascertained by Professor

Righi along the lines of force. This result was also ascertained subse-

<|uently, and independently, by M. Cotton.

2. The next point of interest consisted in placing beyond doubt that

the various moditied forms of triplet, that is the quartets, octets, etc., are

not produced by reversal or any other extraneous cause, but are ti'ue

magnetic perturbations of the same kind as the normal triplet, which is to

Anbe expected from the simplest theoretical considerations.  account of

the experiments by which this was determined will be found in the

'Philosophical Magazine' for February 1899 ('Phil. Mag.' vol. xlvii.

p. 165).

     In pursuing this inquiry it was found that in a very strong magnetic
field the quartets ultimately became resolved into sextets, the side lines
of the ([uartets splitting up into pairs and separating as the strength of

the tield gradually increased.

     These (juartet forms, and various other types of perturbation, were
observed by Mr. Preston in the beginning of November 1897, and were
shown at the following meeting of the Dublin University Experimental

' See NaUire, lix. 228-!), January 1899.

Science Association. Subsequently the quai-tet form (which we have now

proved in the cases observed to be really a sextet) was independently
observed by M. Cornu ^ and others.

      3. Finally, from the various observations of the character and measure-
ments of the amount of the magnetic effect experienced by the various
spectral lines of several substances, a general law has been inferred con-

cerning the effect which may be stated as follows : -

     (i) The spectral lines of a given substance may be divided into groups
such that all the members of one group suffer the same kind of perturba-
tion in the magnetic field, but the kind of perturbation of all the members

of another group is different. Thus, for example, in the series of triplets
of zinc, the first of one triplet is similarly affected to the first of each of
the other triplets, while the second of one triplet is affected in the same

way as the second in each of the other triplets, but in a different way from
first a,nd third of the triplet. Hence the series of firsts of each triplet
constitute a group all the members of which are similai-ly affected, and the

series of seconds and thirds are other such groups.
      (2) The character of the effect is the same in the corresponding lines

of the spectra of chemically related elements. Thus, the triplets of cad-

mium are affected in the same way, both as regards the character and the

magnitude of the effect, as are the triplets of zinc.
      (3) If the magnitude of the effect be measured by the difference of

wave-length of the lateral comporients of the magnetically resolved line,
then throughout any one group the magnitude of the effect is inversely

as the square of the wave-length of the line. This means that e/m is
the same for all the lines of the same group, but not the same for all the
lines of the spectrum. In other words, the difference of frequency
between the lateral components of the magnetically resolved line is the
same for all the lines of the same group ; and if the maQnitnxle of the
effect be measured by this difference of frequency, then we may say that
the effect is the same in character and magnitude for all the lines of the
same group. It differs from group to group in any one substance, but is
the same for corresponding groups in difierent substances.

      Further information will be found in this connection in the ' Philo-
sophical Magazine,' vol. xlvii. p. 165, February 1899, and the ' Phil. Trans.
Royal Dublin Society,' vol. viii. series II. p. 7, 1899.

--Meteurological Observatory, Montreal. Eeport of the Committee, con-

      sisting of Professor H. L. Callendar {Chairman), Professor C.

      McLeod {Secretary), Professor F. Adams, aiul Mr. R, F. Stupart,

       appointed for the purpose of establishing a. Meteorological Observatory

      on Mount Royal, Montreal, Canada.

 As reported last year, some very good records of temperature on the top

 of the mountain were obtained by means of a recorder set up in the
 College Observatory at the base, and connected by a line about a mile
 long to an electrical thermometer set up in the tower on the summit.
 Unfortunately, the grant for meteorological purposes had been reduced by
the present Government, and the sum of money at the disposal of the
Committee, amounting to only half the estimated cost, did not permit of
protection for the line and the instruments in a sufficiently permanent
manner. In the early part of the summer the lock was broken, and the

instruments mischievously damaged. At a later date, the thermometer

was struck by lightning, and the insulation of the line suffered. After
some delay, owing to the winter, the cost of a new thermometer was
defrayed by the Physics Building Committee, but it was found that the
insulation of the line had deteriorated seriously in the course of the winter
and the accuracy of the records was considerably impaired. It is hoped
that these defects will shortly be located and repaired, and that the
apparatus will soon be in good working order.

     The Committee ask for reappointment, with a further grant of 20^.
for the more efficient protection of the line and instruments.

It was shown in a preliminaiy report ' that :

           F (r,7')=./^I(cos (/.)'+! e"*-^-^"-'*' . . . (vi.)

where tan ^=1' and )^ (r, 0) is a function which can be fairly easily calcu-
lated, when certain preliminary functions have been tabulated. These

Xi) X3» Xo' X7 functions were calculated in the preliminary report above

referred to.'^

    Now, in actual statistical application r may take as large a value as

40 to 00. Hence, if cos f be taken from the tables (cos (b)'*^ is liable to

a large error often reaching to the fifth place of figures when we are
Ftabulating log (r, r). Clearly, for accuracy, it is better not to find

FF (r, )') by interpolating between two tabular values of log (?·, y), but

to deal with some new function in which (cos (p)''^^ does not occur, and
then multiply by the actual value of (cos 'P)'*'- deduced from the exact
value of the angle (j> and the quantity ?·. This will not, of course, free us

from the error, which arises from a value of cos </> tabulated to only
seven figures being raised to a high power. The value of (cos <j))''^' must,

therefore, be found from 10-figure logarithmic tables of trigonometrical
functions like those of Vega's : ' Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus

of 1791. But the error due to the determination of (cos^))''^ from

7 -figure tables is not significant in the case of statistical investigations.

For 2/o) ^'^ determined for any observed frequency series--probably not

to a considerable percentage error.-* It seemed, accordingly, desirable to

tabulate for statistical purposes a function which is without the factor

(cos (i>y*^, and has yet a real statistical importance. This function is
obtained in the following manner. The frequency y^ per unit of variable

   HIt is this function {r, v) which has been chosen for the purposes of
--tabulation. Equation (viii.) shows its statistical importance it enables

--us, knowing the standard deviation o- of the observations to at once

determine the frequency of mean values. It will approximate more and

more to \/2rr as the frequency approaches a normal distribution, which it
Hdoes when r is large. Hence the differences of

and are likely to be smooth, when r is. large, and consequently F (r, v),

owing to the factor (cos ^)'''^^ is not capable of very accurate determina-

   H(2) But while (r, »') is clearly the best function to tabulate when r

is moderately large, it is not so satisfactory when /' is small ; for although

in that case (cos (p)''*'^ may be fairly easily found from the tables in
ordinary use, so that it might seem that F (r, i') could be accurately

determined, yet the expression for x (>"> ^) i^ow becomes unsatisfactory.
As has been shown in the Preliminary Report, § 2, we have to deal

with a semi-convergent series, and cannot for small values of r go beyond

as the tables only proceed by integers, we have used the following results

This process was used for values of F (r, v) for r=l to 7, and the
Hvalues of F (r, >) and
                            (r, »-) as found from the x-functions of the

tables of the Preliminary Report were compared and found to agree with

these for r=6 and r=7. For r=6 to ?-=50 the x-function tables were

used. The values of ip are taken from 0° to 45° proceeding by degrees,

for no instance has yet been found in statistical investigations in which

V is greater than r. Should such cases arise in future, then F (r, v) or

H (r, )') must be calculated from the x-tables for (^=46" to 90° given in

the Preliminary Report.

     (3) The whole of the arithmetical work (which proved far more
laborious than was initially anticipated) has been undertaken by Miss

Alice Lee, B.A., D.Sc, Assistant-Lecturer in Physics in Bedford College,

London. The arithmetic has been done twice independently. Miss Lee

having been most kindly assisted in the verification of the tables by Miss

M. Fry, Miss C. D. Fawcett, B.Sc, Miss E. Bramley-Moore, B. A,, and Miss

L. Bramley-Moore. To the extent of the methods used we think the accu-

racy of the tables is guaranteed by the agreement reached by the two sets

of calculations. But soui'ces of error common to both independent calcu-

lations have been already referred to, and may be indicated more particu-

Hlarly here. So far as {r, v) as obtained from (ix.) is concerned, 2x has

been worked to 9 figures and is certainly correct to 8 figures. 2)^ log e was

Wethen found by actual multiplication.                consider', accordingly, that

Hlog     r=6(r, v\ is correct to 7 figures in all cases, from  to ?'=50.  Any

Finaccuracy of log (r, v) arises from the extra factors in (xi.). To begin

with, the factor e''*=e'*''"" * appears as r$ tan (p log e. ^ was obtained from

  '^  X  n°,  usinf°f  the  Brunsviga  calculator  ;  tan r was taken from Bheticus'

10-figure trigonometrical tables of 1-596, and the product r^/* tan log e

Weobtained by the Brunsviga.           consider, therefore, that r./< tan </<

log e, like the previous product \'1 log e, should lie correct to at least 10

places of figures. ('"+1) log cos f was found from Vega's 10-figure
trigonometrical tables by actual multiplication. It is unlikely, accordingly,

that there will be an error in this product in the 8th place, and we feel

fairly certain that the method, when all the factors are added in, cannot

Fafiect the value of log (?', > ) to the 7th place. Still, the diflerences in
the tabulated values of Flog (r, r) are in parts of the table considerable,

and interpolated values, such as we get in practice, can hardly be con-

sidered as accurate beyond the 6th figure, or even at certain parts of the

table beyond the 5th figure. This, of course, is suflBcient for statistical

 purposes, but if for physical or mathematical calculations it should be

 Gneedful to have the (?·, v) integrals to a closer value, a table will have
' to be constructed for much smaller diSerences of r and 0. At present

Hthe physicist or mathematician must use our (r, v) integral and find

(cos </>)"^ and e'*'""* for the actual values of r and by lO-figui-e logarith-

Hemic tables.          will hardly be sure of being correct to the 6th figure, if

he uses the usual 7 -figure logarithmic tables.

      For values of r less than 6, formulte (xvi.) and (xvii.) have been used,

as already noted. The factorial denominators were calculated by aid of

the Brunsviga and Vega's 10-figure tables. For the hyperbolic sine and

cosine tables have been calculated to 14 figures by J. W. L. Glaisher and

F. Newman, but the differences were so large in the part of the tables

required, that it seemed safer to recalci^late e^^ for the special valvies of

                                   applied should give both log (r, .) and

Flog (r, r) correct to seven figures.
On the whole we consider that the Table, if the calculations are not
in error, ought to be correct to the number of figures tabulated. The
calculations have been done with much labour and care, twice indepen-
dentlv with 7 -figure tables, and then again with 10-figure tables. The
latter investigation modified generally the seventh figure, and occasion-

ally the sixth, but gave a much smoother system of differences.
Logarithms of the functions and their differences were worked to ten
                                   nearest figure in the seventh place, thus
figures and then cut off at   the
                                   nearest values of the true differences, and
ihe recorded differences are  the

not the differences of the recorded logarithms.
(A) With regard to interpolation formulae for tables of double entry,

we have been unable to discover much consideration of the subject, pos-
Wesibly because hitherto such tables have been rather rare.                     do not

know of any formulte, similar to those for interpolation on a curve, for

interpolating on surfaces. The simplest formula, using second differ-

ences, is

* + 4Wa;-l)AX,o + 2x-2/AAXo + 2/(2/-l)^'X..}                 ·       (^^^"·)

                                                                ·

where A denotes a difference with regard to x, and A' with regard to y.

But if we consider »,., ,, to be the ordinate of a surface, and the figure

Pto represent the xy plane of such a surface, then it is clear that, if be
the point x, y, and A, B, C, D, &c. the adjacent points at which the
ordinates are known from the table of double entry, only the points
NA, B, C, D, J, and are used by the formula ; and of these points, not
equal weight is given to the fundamental points A, B, C, D, for C only

appears in a second difference. If another point of the fundamental

Asquare other than be taken as origin, we get a divergent, occasionally
-- D--a widely divergent result. If we use only four points A, B, C,
                                                                                  to

determine the value of the function at P, then we might take the ordinate

at P of the plane which (by the method of least squares) most nearly

passes through the four points of the surface vertically above A, B, C, D.

We have then

but by trial it has been found that this formula gives occasionally worse

results than that for first differences, using only three points. To find

by the methods of simple interpolation (with first or first and second

Pdifferences) the points a and h,"^ and then interpolate        between them,

generally gives a fairly good result ; but this result usually differs some-

' For other investigations we have found,

what from that obtained by first finding the value of the function at e

fand by simple interpolation, and then interpolating P between these.

On the whole we consider that methods of intei-polating in the case of

tables of double or multiple entry require a full discussion and treatment
which would be out of place here. The chief source of error which will
arise in using the present tables will, we believe, be the error of inter-
polation ; but this error with caution will not, we consider, amount to
more than 3 or 4 in the 10,000, an error which is of no importance in

statistical investigations.

PROGRESS OF THE SOLUTION OF THE PROHLEM OF THREE BODIES. 121

Refort on the Progress of the Solution of the ProUem of Tliree Bodies.
                               By E. T. Whittaker.

                                                      Introduction.

The present Report is the fulfilment of the author's engagement to draw
up a report on the planetary theory for the Association. The above title

has been adopted in place of that originally chosen, as indicating more
definitely the aim of the Report.

     The fundamental problem of dynamical astronomy is that of deter-
mining the motion in space of any number of particles which attract each
other according to the Newtonian law. The solution of the problem
depends on the integration of a system of differential equations ; and
various methods have been given for the solution of the equations by
means of infinite series of known functions. The methods are, however,
in general cumbrous ; the convergence of the series employed has only
recently been considered with any success, and the true nature of the
integrals of the problem is unknown.

     The theory has hitherto been developed chiefly with the object of
determining the motion of the moon and planets. While, however, the
lunar and planetary theories are, both of them, attempts to solve the
problem of three bodies, yet the results of the two theories are quite
different in form ; this is owing to the fact that the assumptions on which
the approximations are based are not the same in the two cases. Thus
it is known that if the masses of all but one of the particles are zero {i.e.
do not exert any attraction on each other), these particles will circulate
round the remaining particle in elliptic paths ; and so a method of approxi-
mation, known as the planetary theory, has been developed, in which it is
supposed that the mass of one body preponderates and the other bodies circle
round it. In the lunar theory, on the other hand, it is assumed that two of
the bodies circle round each other, while circling together round a prepon-
derating third body. This gives rise to a solution of the problem by means

of a diSerent set of infinite series.

     Of course, the planetary and lunar theories do not by any means
exhaust the list of possible methods of approximation. For instance, it is
known that a particular solution of the problem of three bodies exists, in
which the three particles are always at the vertices of a moving equilateral
triangle ; and that, under certain conditions, this is a stable form of
motion. It would therefore be possible to form a theory, analogous to
the lunar and planetary theories, in which the approximation would be
based on the supposition that the motion differed but little from this

type ; and the only reason why this theory has not been developed is, that

it is not called for by the practical needs of computers of the solar system.

     The results of the planetary and lunar theories may be regarded as

furnishing solutions of the fundamental problem by means of infinite

series, valid in each case only so long as the initial conditions are subject
to certain inequalities. In addition to this, there is a considerable litera-

ture dealing with the differential equations of the problem and their
transformations ; and in recent years discoveries have been made relating
to the nature and general properties of the solution, e.g. Bruns's theorem
that no algebraic integrals of the problem of several attracting bodies
                                                                   --

122 REPORT--1899.

exist, beyond the integrals of energy and momentum. In this Report it is

intended to review the state of these various branches of the theory at the

present time, solely in so far as they help in the mathematical discussion

of the fundamental problem ; no attempt is made to consider numerical

applications, or the suitability of the various developments for purposes of

computation. On this account, many jDapers which are of the highest

importance in the practical lunar and planetary theory are left unnoticed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

this is in some respects to be regretted, but it has been rendered necessary

by limitations of space and time.

     The Report attempts to trace the development of the subject in the
last thirty years, 1S6S-98 ; this period opens with the time when the

last volume of Delaunay's ' Lunar Theory' was newly published ; it closes

with the issue of the last volume of Poincar^'s ' New Methods in CelestiaJ

Mechanics.' Between the two books lies the development of the new

dynamical astronomy.

The work will be distributed under the following seven headings ;

 --§ I.  The differential equations of the problem.
--§ II.
--§111.  Certain particular solutions of simple character.

         Memoirs of 1868-89 on general and particular solutions of

         the differential equations, and their expression by means of

                infinite series (excluding Gylden's theory).

--§ IV. Memoirs of 1868-89 on the absence of terms of certain classes

               from the infinite series which represent the solution.

 --§ V. Gylden's theory of absolute orbits.
--§ VI.-- Progress in 1890-98 of the theories of §§ III. and IV

§ VII. The impossibility of certain kinds of integrals.

                     § I. The Differential Equations of the Problem.

     Taking any fixed axes of reference, the motion of three mutually
attracting bodies is determined by nine ordinary differential equations,
each of the second order, or, as it is generally expressed, by a system of

the eighteenth order. The known fact that the centi'e of gravity may be

regarded as at rest is equivalent to six integrals of the system, and so the
system can be reduced to the twelfth order. The further fact that the

components of angular momentum about the axes are constant yields

three more integrals, and the system can thus be reduced to the ninth
order. The integral of energy makes possible a reduction to the eighth
order ; and since the time t only enters by means of its differential dt, it

Acan be eliminated, and the system reduced to the seventh order.

further simplification can be made, which was first pointed out explicitly
by Jacobi,^ though it is really contained in the work of Lagrange,- namely,
that the variables can be so chosen that one of them fi enters only by
means of its differential clQ, ; it can therefore be eliminated (and after-
wards found by a simple quadi'ature), and the system can be reduced to

the sixth order.
     Later writers have not succeeded in reducing the problem to a lower

order than the sixth. It will be seen, however, that distinct advances

have been made in the formulation of the equations and the theory of their

transformation, although progress has not been as marked here as in the

other investigations connected with the jDroblem of three bodies. Besides

the general problem of tliree bodies and of u bodies, several problems of a

more special character are often considered, such as the problem of tliree

bodies in a plane, and the restricted jn-oblem of three bodies. The last-

named, which has occupied a prominent place in recent researches, may

be described as follows : Two bodies, S and J, revolve round their centre

of gi-avity in circular orbits, under the influence of their mutual attrac-
Ation.
                                 third body P without mass (i.e. such that it is attracted by R

and J, but does not disturb their motion) moves in the same plane as S

and J. The restricted problem of three bodies is to determine the motion

of P. This problem was first discussed by Jacobi ' in 1836, who showed

that it depends on a system of differential equations of the fourth order,

one integral of which can be written down. This is now generally called

the Jacobian integral of the restricted problem of three bodies.

The most satisfactory reduction of the differential equations of the

problem of three bodies, previous to 1868, was that of Bour - Bour first

applies a theorem due to Jacobi ^ and Bertrand,-* in which, by making

use of the integrals of motion of the centre of gravity, the problem of

three bodies is made to depend on the motion of two fictitious masses

mj and ^i.,, whose potential enei'gy depends only on the lengths of the

lines joining them to each other and to the origin. Bour takes as his co-

ordinates 5'i and (j.y, the distances of m^ and m^ respectively from the

origin                           q^ and q^, the angles made          by q-^     and  q.j     respectively  with  the

more general case, but for the restricted problem of three bodies they are
as follows : Let n be the mean motion of the two bodies, and x, y the

coordinates of the particle, referred to the centre of gravity of the bodies,
the (moving) a;-axis being the line joining the bodies. Also let

the angle between the plane of the bodies and the invariable plane. Then

PROGRESS OF THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THREE BODIES. 125

In 1868 Eadau published, first in a series ^ of notes in the ' Comptes

Rendus,' and subsequently in a memoir - in the ' Annales de I'Ecole

Normale Superieure,' his researches on the differential equations of the

problem of n bodies. He finds the effect of an orthogonal substitution

performed on the variables in the problem, and shows that Jacobi's substi-

tution in the problem of three bodies is a case of this. Two other cases are

worthy of mention : firstly, a transformation which is equivalent to referring

the second body to the first as origin, the third body to the C.G. of the

second and third, the fourth body to the C.G. of the first three, and so on,

at the same time modifying the masses ; and, secondly, a transformation
wliich shows the existence of n ' canonical ' points, each of which has,

with reference to the motion of (n-- 1) of the bodies, properties similar to

those possessed by the C.G. for the whole system. Considering the case

of three bodies, he deduces Bour's equations, and also a new canonical

system of the eighth order.

   A modification of the transformation of Jacobi and Radau was con-

sidered in 1889 by Andrade,"* and in 1896-7 Poincare * gave another

transformation which appears to be still better suited for effecting the

same reduction.

The results obtained by Allegret '' in 1874 are substantially equivalent

to some of those in Radau's papers.

     Radau's researches were continued in 1869 in a number of pa^Ders,*" of
which that in Liouville's journal is the most complete ; the author dis-

cusses the reduction of the order of a canonical system when one of the

coordinates does not enter explicitly in the energy-function, and applies

his results to the problem of three bodies, arriving at Scheibner's system.

   Hesse' in 1872 published a fresh discussion of the problem of three

bodies, somewhat on the  lines       of  Lagrange's memoir                                                                                         but it was pointed
                                                                                                                                                ;

out by Serret * in 1873 that the equations in one of Hesse's systems were

not independent, and consequently his results were invalid. Serret's

paper contains also an exposition, in an improved and symmetrical form,

of the essential parts of Lagrange's memoir. Other reductions of the

problem of three bodies, which seem scarcely o£ sufficient importance to

be here described in detail, are those of Weiler^ in 1869-70, Hill''^ in

1875, Weiler3 in 1879-80, Seydler-" in 1884, and Duport^^ in 1898.
     The problem of n bodies can be reduced from the 6nth order to the

(6?2.-12)th order, just as the problem of three bodies can be reduced from the

18th order to the 6th. This subject has been discussed in the period
under review by Allegret^ in 1875 (who fell in errors which were pointed
out by Mathieu ^ in 1 877), by Betti ** in 1877, Mathieu ' in 1877, Ball lo in

1877, Dillner ^' in 1877 (who attempted to use quaternions, but made mis-
takes which were pointed out by Bruns '^ in 1880), and Dillner '^ in 1882-S.

     Seydler ^^ in 1885 extended the analysis of Lagrange's treatment of the

problem of three bodies to the case of the problem of four bodies. The

system is reduced ultimately to a system of the twelfth order and quad-

ratures.

The general theory underlying the work of this section has been
Adeveloped by Lie and Mayer.
                              special consideration of the proljleni of

three bodies will be found at p. 282 of a paper '' published by Lie in 1875.

Kiaier^ in 1891, starting from Jacobins transformation, likewise reduced

the problem to a canonical system of the sixth order.

The difierential equations of the restricted problem of three bodies

were discussed by Tisserand^ in 1887 and by Poincare " in 1890. Both

authors reduce the problem to a canonical system of the fourth order

Tisserand takes variables defined by means of the elements of the

instantaneous ellipse described by the particle round one of the bodies,

while Poincare uses the instantaneous ellipse described by the particle

round the centre of gravity of the system.

very simple character ; in one case the three particles are always at tlie
vertices of a moving equilateral triangle and in the other they are always

on a moving straight line. "We shall generally call these respectively the

     The first paper oil the subject in the period under review was
published by Routh ^ in 1875 ; he showed that the three equidistant
particles are stable when the square of the sum of the masses is greater
than twenty-seven times the sum of the products of the masses taken two
and two together ; a result which, however, had already been stated by
Gascheau. The stability was considered from a somewhat more general
point of view by Liapunow^in 1889; and Gylden^ in 1884 discussed
solutions which differ but little from the three coUinear particles.

      Lagrange's results have been generalised, and corresponding theorems

found for the motion of more than three bodies. An attempt made in

this direction by Veltmann* in 1875 is open to criticism, but Hoppe'^ in
1879, and Lehmann-Filhes " in 1891, discovered solutions in which more
than three particles are placed at the corners of a regular polygon or poly-
hedron, or on a straight line. Sloudsky 'in 1892 claimed to have given
some of Hoppe's results in 1878, in a paper published in Russian. In
Hoppe's paper the masses of the particles are supposed to be equal,
which detracts from the value of his results ; in Lehmann-Filhes's paper

the masses are not so restricted.
     Cases in which the triangle formed by the bodies is isosceles were

discussed by Fransen* in 1895, and Gorjatschew^ in 1895-6.

      Series (exchtding Gylden's Theory).

     From the time when it was first realised that the motion of the three
bodies cannot be represented in a finite form by means of known functions,

interest has centred chiefly round that division of the subject to which
the present section will be devoted, namely, the derivation, nature, and
properties of the infinite series by means of which the problem can be

solved.

     The result of our observations of the heavenly bodies suggests a form
into which we may try to put the analytical solution. It is found that
the facts can be represented, at any rate for as far back as our records
take us, by supposing that the planets move in ellipses round the sun.

These ellipses are, however, not fixed, but their elements (the eccentricity,

'&c.) vary from year to year. Some of these variations, or iivequalities, are

--jxriodic that is to say, can be expressed by terms such as a sin (bt -{· c),

·where aj h, c are constants ; such variations obviously do not in the long

run produce any marked change in the solar system ; while other variations
-- + +are secular that is to say, are expressed by terms such as at bt'^
                                                                                                                                 . . .;

these variations of course have the effect of continually altering the

orbits, leading ultimately to a completely different configuration.

The method of the classical planetary theory is to express the solution

in this way : differential equations are found for the variations of the

elliptic elements, and from them is found an approximate solution, which

in the earlier memoirs was of the kind just described.

    The question naturally arose. What would be found to be the true

nature of the secular inequalities if the equations were solved rigorously

instead of approximately ? The first approximation can be represented

by terms like ct, where c is a constant ; but it is possible that this is only

the first term in the expansion of (say) sin mt, where vi is a very small

number. If this were the case, the secular terms would really be periodic,
though of a very long period. In researches relating to the stability of
the solar systeni, and the expression of the coordinates after long intervals
of time, the settlement of this question is of fundamental importance.

     Although the founders of the planetary theory succeeded to some
extent in their approximation in thus replacing secular terms by trigono-
metric terms of long period, the most important contribution to the sub-
ject previous to the period under review was the method by which

Delaunay ^ discussed the motion of the moon, the essence of which may

be described as follows.

    PLet S, J, be the three bodies, and let the mass of P be zero ; then

the motion of S and J, being elliptic, may be supposed known, and to

determine the motion of P we have a system of the sixth order. This

can be brought to the form

        dp, _ 2H dq,_                                                          cH     _/ .  1                    ·i\

Hwhere  is a function of t and of the generalised coordinates ^;,., g,i
H may be called the disturbing function, and can be expanded as an

infinite series, each term of which consists of a function Pmof 2^ij P-jy
multiplied by the cosine of a linear function of q^, q.,, q-^, t. Delaunay then
fixes the attention on some particular one of these terms, and shows how

to find a transformation from the variables p,, q, to new variables ^?',, q',.

H·where H' is a function of ^;',., q',, t of the same kind as ; but H' does not

Hcontain any term correspondinc/ to the term in ivhich is under considera-

tion. This transformation has therefore robbed the disturbing function

of one of its terms                                                            by a fresh transformation we can  deprive  H' of  any

other term, and so on. In this way all the important periodic terms are

abolished from the disturbing function, and when the residue has become

negligeable, the equations are integrated ; and the coordinates are thus
expressed in terms of six arbitrary constants, and the time by means of

series in which the time occurs only in the arguments ofjKriodic terms.

     In 1872 Newcomb,' assuming that the coordinates of the planets can
be expressed by ti-igonometric series, as in Delaunay's theory, proved

various properties of the coefficients, &c., by using the function called by
Clausius the virial, which is the mean value of the kinetic energy of the
system. This was extended by Siacchi ^, in 1873.

    In 1874 Newcomb ^ proceeded to justify his assumption regarding the

expression for the coordinates as functions of the time. He applies the
+transformation of Jacobi and Radau to the equations of (/t 1) bodies, and

so obtains a system of the 6?ith ordei". It is assumed tliat a set of infinite

series of the forms

Pi^ S +I'^',. '=.···'.,, sin (^l'^l+*2'^2 ^3^3+ · · · -^Hn^Zn)

+can be found, where p, is one of the coordinates and A,.=/,. i,i! (the quan-
Ktities I being 3» arbitrary constants, and the quantities h and
                                                                  being

functions of 3?i other arbitrary constants), such that the differential equa-

tions are approximately satisfied by these series. Newcomb, then, using

the method of variation of arbitrary constants, replaces these series by

others of the same form which satisfy the differential equations to a higher

degree of approximation. Proceeding in this way, it appears that the

problem of three bodies can be formally solved by series of this kind.

The year 1877 saw the appearance of a paper'' which maybe regarded

as the beginning of the new era in Dynamical Astronomy. The author,
Mr. G. W. Hill, was at the time an assistant on the staff of the American

Ephemeris.

The first of the novelties in this paper is the abandonment of Kepler's

ellipse. It had hitherto been usual to take, as the first approximation to

the orbit of the moon, an elliptic path round the earth ; the orbit, in fact,

which the moon would actually describe if the sun did not exist to disturb

it ; the actual j^ath of the moon was then found by calculating the per-

turbations caused by the sun on this elliptic motion. Hill, however, does
away with the elliptic orbit altogether, and takes, as the intermediate

orbit or first approximation to the moon's path, an orbit which includes

all the inequalities which depend only on the ratio of the mean motions

of the sun and moon, but takes account of no other inequalities. This

difference between Hill and the older theorists may be otherwise stated

as follows : the old astronomers first solved the problem of two bodies,

and then attempted to solve the problem of the three bodies by suitably

varying the solution so obtained ; whereas Hill begins by solving the re-
stricted problem of three bodies, and then attempts to solve the problem

of three bodies by suitably varying this solution.

Suppose, then, that an orbit for the particle is known, which is periodic;

i.e. w^hich is such that the two bodies and the particle retake the same

relative positions after the lapse of a certain interval of time. Then the

coordinates of the particle can be expressed as sums of sines and cosines of

Wemultiples of a linear function of the time.  can now consider the small

oscillations of the particle about this orbit, when the initial conditions of

its motion are not exactly such as to cause it to describe the pei-iodic orbit.

These oscillations represent those inequalities in the moon's motion which

depend only on the eccentricity of the lunar orbit and the ratio of the

mean motions of the sun  and  moon                          and  the  period                                                                                                       of  the  oscillations

represents the time between two successive perigees of the moon, so that the

difference between this period and the period of the orbit gives that part

of the motion of the lunar perigee which is a function of the mean motions

--of the sun and moon whence the title of the memoir.

Let IV represent the distance (measured along the normal) of the

particle from the periodic orbit, at any time t during the performance of

the small oscillations. Then Hill finds that iv is given by an equation of

the form

where depends only on the relative position of the two bodies and the

particle ;  is therefore a known periodic function of t, and can be ex-

panded in the form

where 0^, 0,, 0^ . . . are pure constants.
     (It ought to be stated here that, since all inequalities in the moon's

motion which involve the sun's parallax are neglected, the distance of the
two bodies from each other is supposed to be infinite, and the one of them
at infinity is supposed to possess such an (infinite) mass as would correspond
to a finite mean motion.)

     The problem therefore is to solve the differential equation

                                11 = -co

stitutes this value of iv in the differential equation. Since the whole

coefficient of each power of ; must now be zero, an infinite number of

equations are obtained, which involve the 6's linearly ; on eliminating the

^)'s a determinant with an infinite number of rows and columns (an idea

first introduced by Kotteritzsch in 1870) is obtained, which involves only

c and the known quantities 0,j. This determinant, equated to zero,

furnishes the value of c, and consequently the motion of the lunar

perigee.

     The convergence of the infinite determinant was not considered by
Hill ; this gap in the work was filled by Poincare ' in 1886.

     Hill's paper was reprinted,- with some additions, in 1886.

     In 1877, Adams,^ referring to Hill's paper, remarks that he had himself,

many years previously, investigated the motion of the moon's node by a
method similar to that used by Hill for the perigee, and had found the

same infinite determinant.
     In 1878 Hiin published in a more complete form the derivation of the

periodic solution, which in its character of intermediate orbit had been
the foundation of his pi'evious paper. The solution is found by actually
substituting, in the differential equations of the restricted problem of
three bodies, expansions of the desired form with undetermined coefficients ;
these coefficients are then determined as functions of a parameter m, which

depends on the ratio which the period of the periodic solution bears to
the period of revolution of the two principal masses round each other, i.e.

on the ratio of the mean motions of the sun and moon. By varying m,

different periodic solutions are obtained ; the last one of Hill's solutions

(the orbit of maximum lunation) has cusps at the points where the elonga-

tion from the sun is a right angle.
     Hill's work soon led to further developments. In 1883-4 Poincare,''

proved the existence of an infinite number of periodic solutions in the

general problem of three bodies; and in 1887 Bohlin ' applied an idea of

Hill's (viz. using the Jacobian integral to separate off regions of space

into which the moon cannot enter) to a more general class of dynamical

problems. In the same year (1887) Hill ^ discussed the different systems

of variables which might be employed in solving a system somewhat more

general than the restricted problem of three bodies, namely, that of a

particle of zero mass, attracted by two bodies which move in Keplerian

ellipses round their common centre of gravity.

Poincare's^ memoirs of 1881-6 on curves defined by differential

equations lead to one result of importance in Dynamical Astronomy. In

oixler that the system of n bodies may be stable, two conditions must be

fulfilled : firstly, the mutual distances must always remain within certain

limits ; and, secondly, if the system has a definite configuration at any
instant, it must be possible to find a subsequent instant at which the

configuration differs from this as little as we please. It follows from the

investigations of this series of memoirs that, if the first of these conditions

is satisfied, the second is also.

In 1883 Lindstedt* resumed the consideration of the problem which

had been treated by Newcomb nine years before, namely, the expression of

the coordinates in the problem of three bodies as trigonometric series,

Awhose arguments are linear functions of the time.                                                                                                                                                               fuller account '^ of

the work was published in 1884. The author starts from the equations of

Lagrange's ' Essai sur le probleme des trois corps ; the system is reduced
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  '

to four different equations, each of the second order ; and these are solved
by successive approximation. After the rth approximation has been

+effected, the (r l)th approximation is obtained by solving four linear

non- homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients. This

can be done by known methods ; but if the solution is carried out in the

usual way, term^ will arise in which the time t occurs as a factor (these

are the ' secular terms ' of the old planetary theory). Lindstedt therefore

modifies the equations in accordance with a method indicated by himself

in a previous paper," and obtains a solution in which t occurs only in the

arguments of trigonometric functions. It thus appears that the mutual

distances of the three bodies can be expressed as trigonometric series of

four arguments, each of which is a linear function of the time. The

defects of Lindstedt's memoir in regard to convergence, &c., will be

noticed in connection with other papers.

on the lines of Delaunay's lunar theory ; Tisserand extended Lindstedt's

theorem, and in 1887 Lindstedt ' showed how this extension could be

Anderived from his own original paper.  imperfection in Lindstedt's

first paper was removed by Poincare - in 1886, who, by an ingenious
application of Green's theorem, proved that only one secular term appears

in each of Lindstedt's approximations, and that this can always be

removed.

In 1889 Poincar^^ gave a fresh method of derivation for Lindstedt's

series, by transforming the Gylden- Lindstedt difierential equation into a

Hamiltonian system of the fourth order, replacing this Ijy tlie corre-

sponding Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation, and solving the

latter by a series proceeding in ascending powers of a small parameter,

the coefficients being trigonometric series of two arguments. Poincari^
observes, however, that in the problem of three bodies this method will

not apjDly if Kepler's ellipse is taken as the first approximation, and

consequently another intermediary orbit must be used.

The number of independent arguments required in order to express

the coordinates in the problem of n bodies, without having the time out-

side trigonometric functions, was shown by Harzer'* in 1889 to be

3(7i-l).

     The question of the convergence of sums of periodic terms, such as are
obtained in Lindstedt's expansions, had now become a matter of prime

importance. Poincare'' in 1882-4 showed, firstly, that if such a series is

absolutely convergent for certain values of the time, it is so for all values

of the time ; and, secondly, that a function cannot be represented by two

different absolutely convergent series of this kind. Further, a function

represented by such a series can assume indefinitely great values if the

convergence is not uniform. In a further note " in 1885, he showed that

this can happen in two ways : either the function may steadily increase,
or its value may oscillate, the amplitude of the oscillations increasing

indefinitely. Bruns " in 1884 further discussed the series of Dynamical

Astronomy : as these are usually obtained by the integration of trigono-
metric series, it follow.=: that the coefficients of those terms whose periods

are very long will be affected by very small divisors. Bruns shows that

this causes the series to fluctuate between convergence and divergence,

when the constants, on which the coefficients of the time in the arguments

depend, are altered in value by small amounts.

Features of special interest present themselves in the planetary theory

when the periods of two planets are very nearly commensurate with each

other. In this case some of the inequalities of long period rise to im-

portance ; thus, in the theory of Jupiter and Saturn an inequality with
a period of 900 years has a large coefficient ; the grandeur of this

coefficient is due to the fact that its denominator contains a factor

and this factor is very small, on account of the approximate commensura-
bility of n and n'. In certain cases (called lihrutions) the comniensura-
bility is exact ; thus a linear relation exists between the mean motions of

three of Jupiter's satellites.

     Tisserand ' in 1887 applied Delaunay's method of integration to dis-
cuss the effect of approximate commensural)ility, showing that commen-
surability is not inconsistent with the stability of the system.

     Bohlin^ in 1888-9 gave a new method for treating the cases in which

terms with small divisors appear likely to endanger the coiavergence. He

considers the equation

                      =^j2 -Si/3y sin (Oi--jw),

where the coefficients {3^ are of the order of the disturbing masses and

form an absolutely convergent series, and where the independent variable

lu is, in the applications to the planetary theory, a multiple of the time.

series which represent the quantities V,., and hence the original difficulty

            Jrovi the Infinite Series which Represent the Solution.

The distinction between the secular and periodic inequalities of the

elliptic elements of a planet's orbit has already been explained. Laplace

--in 1773 showed that one of these elements the mean distance or semi-

--major axis of the orbit has no secular inequalities at all, when terms of

higher orders than the first powers of the masses and the squares of the
eccentricities and inclinations are neglected. Lagrange in 1776 proved
that this result still holds when all powers of the eccentricities and
inclinations are taken into account ; and in 1 808 Poisson showed that it

is still true when terms involving squares of the masses are included in

the calculations.

     In the period under review, Tisserand ' in 1875-6 simplified Poisson's

proof by using the transformation of Jacobi and Radau, thus reducing the

problem of three bodies to a system of the twelfth order, depending on a

single perturbing function.

In 1874-5, Mathieu'^ extended the discussion so as to include terms

Hemultiplied by the cubes of the masses.   first, by using Jacobi's sub-

stitution, replaces the sun and three planets by three fictitious planets

moving round a fixed centre ; the orbits of these bodies are homothetic
with the actual orbits, and consequently the study of the variations of the

mean distances in the fictitious orbits will give the required results. The

aiithor then, by developing the disturbing function as far as terms of the

third order in the masses, shows that the reciprocals of the mean distances

have no secular variations of this order.

     In 1877 Haretu ^ published an extract from a memoir '' which appeared

in 1883. He uses the transformation by which Tisserand had, in 1875,

simplified Poisson's work, and discusses a memoir published in 1816, in

which Poisson believed he had proved the non-existence of secular tei"ms

in the mean distances, of the third order in the perturbing masses, when

the variations of the elements of the disturbed planet only were taken

into account. Haretu shows that Poisson had ovei'looked a certain class

of terms, and proves that secular inequalities arise from these terms,

which are not ultimately cancelled ; and hence that the theorem of the
invariability of the mean distances holds only to terms of the second order

in the disturbing masses. Haretu, however, does not give the explicit

analytical expression of the third order terms in the secular inequalities.

PROGRESS OF THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THREE BODIES. 137

     In 1889, Eginitis ' gave the analytical expression for those secular
inequalities of the roeau distances which are of the third order in the dis-
turbing forces. After showing that they can arise only from a term

where -=-- denotes the aggregate of terms of the first and second order,

                   ct

he finds V-^dt by substituting the ordinary development of the disturb-

                    J ci

ing function, squares it, and shows that secular inequalities arise from the

multiplication of terms with the same arguments. He further shows that

these secular inequalities are periodic, though their period is very long.
     The transition from the old planetary theory, with its secular and

periodic inequalities, to the new Dynamical Astronomy, in which all terms
are periodic, had its effect on theorems such as that now under considera-
tion. Tisserand ^ in 1888 gave the new formulation of the theorem of the
invariability of the mean distances, when the solution of the problem of

three bodies is expressed as in Delaunay's lunar theory. He shows that

the theorem does not hold when terms of the order of the fourth power of
the ratio of the mean motions are taken into account, and for the general

problem of three bodies confirms Haretu's result that the theorem does
not hold for terms of the order of the cube of the disturbing forces.

    In 1878 Adams ^ published .some curious results relating to one of the

expansions in the lunar theory. Let e be the eccentricity of the lunar
orbit, and let y be the sine of half the inclination of the moon's orbit to
the ellipse ; these quantities are supposed defined as in Delaunay's

--theory : let n be the moon's mean motion, (1 c)?ithe mean motion of the

lunar perigee, (1 g)n the mean motion of the moon's node, a the mean

distance, and r the radius vector. Then the non-periodic part of - can

be expanded in the form

                A + Be2 + C72 + Ee'' + 2FeY + Gy''+ . . .

where A, B, C are. . . functions of the solar eccentricity and of the
ratio of the mean motions of the sun and moon ; similarly the terms in

c which involve e^ and y^ can be denoted by He^ + Ky-, and the similar

tei-ms in g by Me'' -f- Ny^.
     Then Adams's theorems are that

               B=0, C^O, EK-FH=0, FN-GM=0.

     These results are all obtained by one process, which for the case of the

first may be thus described : consider two moons, of which the orbit of one

has no eccentricity or inclination, and the orbit of the other has no inclina-
tion. It is proved that a certain function of the coordinates of the two
moons is purely periodic ; and it is shown that this requires the vanishing

of the quantity B.

                            § V. Gyldc'n's Theory of Absolute Orbits.

    In 1881 Hugo Gyld^n, Director of the Observatory at Stockholm, began
the publication of a new method for calculating the motions of the
heavenly bodies. The method has been made of practical importance by

its application, in the hands of Gyld^n's pupils, to the minor planets, and
is of theoretical interest from the fact that (as in Delaunay's, Newcomb's,
and Lindstedt's memoirs) the time appears only in the arguments of
periodic terms. In this report it seems best to give, first of all, a general
account of the method, and then briefly to notice the series of memoirs in
which Gylden and his pupils have developed it.

     Consider, then, a system consisting of the sun and two planets. For
convenience one of these will be spoken of as the disturbed and the other

as the disturbing planet. At any instant the motion of the disturbed

planet is taking place in a certain (moving) plane, which passes through

the sun ; this we can call the plane of its instantaneous or-bit ; in this
plane we take (as an axis from which to measure angles) a line which
moves with the plane in such a way that the surface formed by the
motion of the line always cuts the plane orthogonally. The angle between

this line and the radius vector to the planet can be called the planet's
trtie longitude, and denoted by v ; the radius vector from the sun to the
planet will be denoted by r.

     The quantities r, v are given by differential equations of the form

dL,dv\^h^ ^d^r^_^JdvY -K^^^cU

dt\ dt)        dv' dt^  \dt )  T                                      '

                                                          cr

where O (which is called the disturbing function) is supposed to be

expressed in terms of r, v, and the quantities which define the moving

Mplane and the position of the disturbing planet, and where is the sum

of the masses of the sun and the disturbed body.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             .

     Let the perpendicular distance of the disturbed body from some fixed
plane be zr. Then the third diflerential equation of the disturbed body's

motion may be written in the form

+Msr=ad^ (zr)  function of the positions of the planets.

    Now introduce new variables p, rj, S connected with the old variables

where a is a constant called the jrrotometer, as yet undetermined ; as there

are only two conditions here to determine the three quantities p, ?/, S we

can impose another condition later.

where Zj is a certain function of the positions of the planets.

    Now let us consider the form in which Gyld(5n wishes to express the

solution of these equations.

     The differential equations will finally be solved by means of sums of
periodic terms whose arguments are linear functions of v ; these terms

may be classified in the following way :
     Firstly, there will be terms which vanish altogether when the dis-

turbing mass is put equal to zero ; these are called coordinated terms, and

correspond to the ' periodic inequalities ' of the classical planetary theory.

     Secondly, there will be terms which, when the disturbing mass is put

equal to zero, do not vanish, but coalesce with the terms which represent
the Keplerian elliptic motion of the disturbed planet round the sun.
These terms involve the disturbing mass in their arguments, but not in
their coefficients ; they are called elementary terms, and correspond to the
' secular inequalities ' of the classical planetary theory. Terms will also
occur in the course of Gylden's process which involve the disturbing mass
in the denominator of their coefficients, and so would become infinite if
the disturbing mass were put equal to zero ; these are called hyper-
elementary, and it is shown that they do not appear in the final result.

And, lastly, we have already seen that when the periods of two planets

are nearly commensurable, certain terms of long period rise to importance
these are called the sem,%- elementary or characteristic terms for the planet

under discussion.
      The quantity as already defined, will be composed of both elementary

                                                                        i>,

and coordinated terms. Let {(>) denote the elementary terms, and let V\>

denote the coordinated terms, so

                                     p=(p) + R.

It will appear that p is of the form

We can now define rj ; let

stemmatic argument.

     If in the expressions for the coordinates we strike out all the co-

ordinated terms, leaving only those which are elementary, these modified

expressions for the coordinates will define a new orbit, which will be so
near to the true orbit that the dilFerence between them will be only of the
same order of magnitude as the disturbing forces. This new orbit may be
called the absolute orbit. The radius vector in the absolute orbit (r) is
thus defined by

                                                                                   00

where i (called the anastemmatic mod^dv^s) and 6 (called the longitude
of the absohite node) are two more of the six constants of integration of
the problem, and t, i,,, t,,, G,j are constants depending on them. If this

be written in the form

--J is called the anastemmatic function, and (1+t)v Q is called the

anastemmatic argument.
     Gylden (who, however, is not in this particular followed by his pupil

Harzer) further introduces a quantity ^ called the rediiced time, which is
defined by the equation

                                            dr ai (l->?^)^

                              +dv~M'- [l (p)}-'

and a quantity called the time reduction,--^W, defined by

W therefore satisfies the difierential equation

dw_(i-,^) r                 ^1 -+^S^             -n

the integration of this will clearly introduce another arbitrary constant,
                                                                  '

PROGRESS OF THE SOLUTION OF THE TROBLEM OF THREE BODIES. 141

which will be denoted by A, and will be called the absolute longitude, or

mean longittide for <=0.
    The six arbitrary constants which have now been defined are the

Aelements which fix the absolute orbit of the disturbed body, namely,

(the absolute longitude), F (the longitude of the absolute perihelion), 9

(the longitude of the absolute node), a (the protometer), k (the diastem-

matic modulus), and i (the anastemmatic modulus).

     Having now described the form in which the solution is to be obtained,
we can resume the consideration of the differential equations.

    First, we have to expand in a suitable way the disturbing function O
Pand the quantities and Q. This is effected by means of infinite series,

each term of which consists of a product of powers of the various small

quantities such as j?, multiplied by a trigonometrical function of the

longitude.

     Next, we have to substitute these expansions in the differential equations

for p, s, and W, and integrate these equations.

     The equations for p and S are respectively of the forms

          ^ + (l~/3)p=2«,, cos (\,,«-./3,,),

                               -^=26,,cos(X,,i;-- /3,,),

where the quantities X,j are constants, but the quantities «,,, b,,, /3,, contain

the unknown variables. These equations are solved by processes of suc-

cessive approximation ; only those terms are initially retained which have

a considerable effect, and in this way the elementary part {p) is determined.

A feature of Gylddn's treatment of equations such as that given above for

  is the use of the horistic function, which is a modification of the term

l>

containing the first power of the dependent variable, and is designed to

ensure the convergence of the approximations.

    "We may regard the arbitrary constants k and F as arising from the
integration of the equation in p, i and B as arising from that in z, a as
arising from that in S, and A as arising from that in W.

     The principal papers in which Gylden's theory has been developed will
now be briefly noticed. In 1881 Gylden published three short papers ' in
French and German, and three long memoirs in Swedish. ^ The deriva-
tion of the differential equations of the first Swedish memoir was simplified
by Backlund ^ and Callandreau.

     Further notes and criticisms on the early part of the theory of
intermediate orbits were given in 1882 by Thiele' and E.adau.° The

notion of the absolute orbit and the definitions of elementary and co-
ordinated terms are introduced in the second part of the ' Undersokningar.'
Gylden wrote another paper ' on this in 1882, and in the same year dis-

cussed further ^ one of the difl'erential equations of his theory of inter-

mediate orbits.

   A long series of papers dealing -with the processes for integrating

differential equations of the second order by successive approximation, and
with the convergence of the developments, was published''^ by Gylden in

1882-96. On this see also Harzer.^

     In 1885 Gylden-^ and Shdanow'^ applied the theory of intermediate
orbits, which had been given in the 'TJndersdkniugar,' to the case of the
moon's motion. The problem is made to depend on the solution of the
Gylden-Lindstedt equation, and the results yield an approximation to the
motion of the perigee. Andoyer "^ also applied Gyld(5n's theory to the

moon in 1887 ; and Tisserand * in 1888 discussed the Gylden-Lindstedt

equation, and applied his results to Andoyer's equations.
     Harzer '' in 18S6 applied Gylden's ideas to the determination of the

motion of those of the minor planets {e.g. Hecuba) whose mean motion is
approximately twice as great as that of Jupiter. On account of this
approach to commensurability, some of the characteristic terms become
very important. Harzer modifies Gylden's original procedure in two

respects : firstly, in using the true longitude throughout as the independent
variable ; and, secondly, in abandoning the use of the ' reduced time.'

PROGRESS OF THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THREE BODIES. 143

Some criticisms on Harzer's paper (and also on Brendel's paper of 1889)
were made by Charliei' in 1890 ; and Harzer himself made some correc-
tions in 1891.'- BreudeP in 1887 derived Harzer's equations as a special

case of Ctyldon's system.
      After this several applications of Gyklen's theories to definite cases

were published. Wellmann ^ in 1888 discussed the intermediate orbit of
Thetis, and Brendel ^' in 1889 found the absolute orbit of planets of the
Hestia type, whose mean motion is approximately triple that of Jupiter.

     Some developments useful in the theory were given in 1889 by Masai,''
and improvements in the integration of the equations were introduced by
Wolf ' in 1890.

     Backlund** in 1892 discussed by Gylde'n's methods the motion of the
group of small planets whose mean motion is approximately twice that of
Jupiter ; in distinction to Gylden and Harzer he takes the time as the
independent variable. The same subject was treated by an improved
analysis in a number of papers '·' published in 1897-8.

      Researches in connection with the properties of series such as those
occurring in Gylden's work were published by Gylden ^" and Backlund " in
1889, and by Olssoni'^ in 1890 and 1891.

      Gylden in 1893 published the first volume of a work ^ which was

intended to furnish, in three volumes, a complete exposition of his theory
of absolute orbits. His death occurred in 1896 before the second volume

was ready, but it is expected that Dr. Backlund, who has charge of

Gylden's manuscript, will as far as possible carry out the original design.

      Backlund - in 1896 described a method, founded on Gylden's woi'k,
for integrating the differential equation which determines the radius
vector in the case of minor planets whose mean motion is nearly twice that
of Jupiter. Brendel ^ in the same year discussed the relation of Gylden's
series to the gaps in the distribution of the minor planets; in 1897
Brendel** announced that he had found an improved process of integration,
and in 1898 the same author published the theoretical part ^ of a memoir
in which the motions of the minor planets are discussed by a modified
form of Gylden's process ; the second part, which is not yet published, is
to deal with definite applications to the solar system.

§ VI. Progress in 1890-8 of the Theories o/§§ ///. and IV.

A new impetus was given to Dynamical Astronomy in 1890 by the

publication of a memoir ^ by Poincare.

WeThe first feature is the introduction of integral invariants.  can

regard a system of ordinary differential equations

_^_A,, . . . --_X,,

as defining thfe motion of a point whose coordinates are (.·c,, a;,, . . . x,,)

in space of n dimensions. If now we consider a group of such points

which occupy a r-dimensional region ^^ at the beginning of the motion,

Athey will at any suljsequent time t occupy a region 'C.  r-ple integral

taken over 'C is called an integral invariant if it has the same value at all

times t. Thus, in the motion of an incompressible fluid, the volume of

the fluid which was contained initially in any given region is an integral

invariant.

     Poincare gives a number of integral invariants which exist in particular

cases, and then proceeds to apply his results to the question of the stability

of the motion in the problem of three bodies. There are, he remarks, two

senses in which the word ' stability ' may be taken. It may be taken to

--mean that variations in the mean distances of the bodies are always

restrained within finite limits Hill and Bohlin have proved that under

PROGRESS OF THE SOLUTION OF THE PROHLEM OF THREE ]!ODIES. 145

certain conditions the motion in the restricted problem of three bodies is,

--in this sense, stable, or stability ' may be taken (as by Poisson) to mean

that the system is to pass infinitely often through positions as near as we
please to the initial position ; the intervening oscillations may be of any

magnitude.

The existence of asymptotic solutions (which will be explained later)

shows that an infinite number of particular solutions of the restricted

problem of three bodies exist, which are not stable inPoisson's sense of the

word. But M. Poincare now proves that there are also an infinite number
which are stable, and, further, that the former are the exception and the

latter are the rule, in the same sense as commensurable numbers are

the exception and incommensurable numbers are the rule. In other

words, the probability that the initial circumstances may be such as to

give rise to an unstable solution is zero.

The proof of this is made to depend on the following theorem ; when

movesthe point (.x-j, ccg, . . . a;,,, 2/1, y-j, · · · 2/n)  so that its coordinates are

always finite, and the integral invariant

            dy^ dy^rfa;i . . . dx^,,
                                            ...

exists, then for every region i'q in space, however small this region may be,
there exist trajectories which pass through r^ an infinite number of times;

and, in fact, those points of r^, which do not give rise to such trajectories
form a volume which is infinitely small compared with ?'o.

     It is thus shown that, when the constant of relative energy in the

restricted problem of three bodies lies between certain limits, the motion
is stable not only in the sense of Hill and Bohlin, but in the sense of
Poisson ; the number of exceptional cases to which this law does not
apply being infinitely small in comparison with the number of orthodox
cases. The result is, however, not extended to the general problem of

three bodies.

     The author next passes to the theory of periodic solutions.

      Consider a system of differential equations

                  §=X (i=l, 2. . . . n),

where the X's are functions of ,t,, a;,, . . . .r,,, and a parameter ^i

X,, X2, . . . X,, may also involve t, but if so they are supposed to be

periodic functions of t with a period 2tt.

   A periodic solution of these equations of period T is of the form

                                      «^i--9i{i\ (*=1. 2, . . . n)

+where the functions <p are such that ^i(< T)=:^,(<). (If rc; is an angular
+ +variable, this may become ^,(< T)=^,(<) 27i7r, where n is an integer.)

     The meaning of this for our purpose is, of course, that the relative

motion of the moving bodies repeats itself at regular intervals T of time.

      Suppose that, for the value of the parameter //, these equations
admit of a periodic solution,

the period being, for example, ^tt. The question is now propounded,

whether the system admits of periodic solutions diflfering but little from

this, when /u has values which, though very small, are different from zero.
M. Poincare finds the answer. By choosing, as initial values of the co-

ordinates, certain functions of /.i, it is in general possible to obtain such

periodic solutions.

     It is further shown that as jj. varies, periodic solutions disappear in
pairs in the same way as the real roots of algebraic equations. This
happens when a certain functional determinant is zero.

      Poincare next proceeds to define the characteristic exponents of a

periodic solution.                                                Consider

     Suppose that a periodic solution, as above, has been found.
a motion differing but little from this, and defined by

           +Xi=(l>i{t) ^i, {i=l, 2, . . . n),

where. the quantities t, are supposed to be so small that their squares and

products can be neglected.

    Then to determine the t's we have

           -^7=v:^.?S {i=l, 2, . . . n).

           dt ' cx^

    As these are linear differential equations of a definite type, with
periodic coefficients, £{ will be a sum of n quantities, each of the form

eVfii^, where the quantities S;, are periodic functions of t with the same

period as f,{t), and the n constants a, are the roots of a certain algebraical

equation.

The constants a are called the characteristic exponents of the periodic

solution. If they are purely imaginary the t's will remain small, and the

periodic solution is stable ; if not, the solution is unstable.

     If two of the characteristic exponents are equal, the form of the

solution is altered, as the terms of the form te"' now appear.

    When the original equations have the Hamiltonian canonical form,

the characteristic exponents can be arranged in pairs, the exponents in
each pair being numerically equal, but of contrary signs. The n values of

a^ are called the coefficients of stability of the periodic solution considered ;

Whenif they are all real, negative, and distinct there is stability.        the

Hamiltonian function does not involve t, one of the n coefficients of

stability is zero, so two of the characteristic exponents are zero.

    The author now shows that the functional determinant already men-

tioned vanishes only when one of the characteristic exponents of the

original periodic solution is zero ; the theorem already given can thus be

put in the more precise form.

odic solution when fi=^0,for which no one of the characteristic exjwnents is

zero, then they also admit of a periodic solution for small values of f^t.

Poincare then turns to the periodic solutions of the differential equa-

tions of dynamics. For greater definiteness, the system is supposed to

have three degrees of freedom ; the equations are taken in the form

           dx.,_ oF rfy,__SF ,.  ^

and F is supposed to be a uniform function of the a"'s and ?/'.'3 independent

depend on an arbitrary parameter p, and to be expansible in the form

the quantities w^ being arbitrary constants of integration. The solution
will be periodic if 71], n.2, 11^ are commensurable with each other ; the

period T will then be the least common multiple of the quantities

2t27r  2_jr

     In general, it will be possible to choose Xi ajj, x^^ so that w,, n2, n^

--may have any prescribed values at least in some domain ; so that there

are oo^ periodic solutions, when fx is zero.
     The author nest proceeds to investigate whether periodic solutions of

period T exist, when ^i is not zero. By a process of reasoning similar to

that used before, it is shown that, corresponding to any periodic solution
which exists when {.1=0, and whose constants satisfy certain conditions,

ther^e exists in general a solution of yeriod T when ^ has small values dif-
ferent from zero. The quantities Xi and --yi nf, can be expressed as series

of ascending powers of ju, the coefficients in which are circular functions of

" ; and a method of forming these expansions is given.

     The results are applied to the restricted problem of three bodies ; a
difficulty arises, which in this case is solved by a simple artifice, but which
is not so easily disposed of in the general problem of three bodies.

      Still considering the dynamical system with three degrees of freedom,
Poincar^ considers a solution

differing but little from a periodic solution, and writes

where S; and T; are periodic functions of t.

    When the periodic solution corresponds to ^=0, the six exponents a

are all zero ; when fi is not zero it is shown that the quantities «, S,, and
T; are expansible in ascending fotoers (not of /x, but) of sj ^x. It is shown
that to every set of values of n^ and n.^ there correspond at least one
stable and one unstable periodic solution ; and that there are exactly as
many stable solutions as unstable when /x is sufficiently small.

     The next idea to be introduced is that of asymptotic solutions. Re-

proved that series can be found which proceed in ascending powers of tlic

quantities \/ fj, A.e"'', e'^'^i, and c"'^"^, and satisfy formally the differential
equations which must be satisfied by the coordinates in an asymptotic
solution ; but that these series are not convergent.

     The series in question belong, in fact, to that important class of
developments which are now called AsymjAotic JExpmisions ; of which
the best-known examples are Stirling's series for the F-function,

and the so-called ' semiconvergent ' expansions for the Bessel functions

and Riemann's 4-function. An example given by M. Poincare is the

function

                             F(i/-,/x)=5rz!

    This series converges uniformly when /x is positive and w <ii\, where
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ]\

Fiv^ is a positive quantity less than unity. If (i/;, /x) is developed in

ascending powers of ^, it becomes

                                                              tu"{-nYn''.

                                                                                              H, p

     This series does not converge, but is an asymptotic expansion ; that

is to say, if 0,, denote the sum of those terms for which the index of yu, is

not greater than 2^, the quantity

                             F{w,u)-(t>p

                                         /x"

tends to zero as fi takes a sequence of positive values tending to zero.

The series thus represents the function F(iv, yu) for small values of /.i in
the same way as Stirling's series represents the T-function for large
values of z. The series found in this section are of the same character,

regarded as functions of V/i for small values of /j.

Passing in the second part of the memoir to the special discussion of a

dynamical system with two degrees of freedom, the author studies the

Anasymptotic sui-faces, which have already been defined.  infinite

number of doubly asymptotic solutions is shown to exist ; these belong at

the same time to both of the classes of asymptotic solutions, i.e. they are

<=--approximately periodic when  00 and <=;oo, but are not periodic in

the meantime.

     Poincare next discusses periodic solutions of the second kind. Suppose
that a set of periodic solutions of the kind already discussed is known,

the expressions for the coordinates being expansible in ascending powers

of //. Let fjQ be a definite value of (a. In certain cases there exists a set
of periodic solutions, in which the expressions for the coordinates are

--expansible in ascending powers of (^ /^(q)*- These are called periodic

solutions of the second kind. Their period is approximately a multiple of

the period of the solution from which we started. When / > pn there are

two of these solutions of the second kind corresponding to each value of f.i ;

when ju=//o they coalesce into a single solution of the first kind, namely,
the member for ^=^/oof the set of solutions from which we started ; when

//<yi/g they are imaginary.

Poincare now goes on to discuss the question of the convergency of

HeLindstedt's series.  takes the differei\tial equations in tiie form

           dt c'l/i'   dt iy^ dt                          Ix^ dt    cx.^

where

                             F=Fo + A'I^i

and Fq is a function of a;, and x.2 only. The a;'s and y'a are regarded as
functions of ly, and 1V2, wliore

                       ·iyj=Xji-f Wi, +iv.,=}.2i '^-^,

and where

                                                          (^=1, 2)

                       n<1

                       -==0

     The author sketches Lindstedt's result, that the constants A," can be so
determined that these expressions for .r, and y, (in which x", and y] are
periodic functions of lo^ and W2) inay formally satisfy the above differential

equations, with an error of the order ^'' + ^
     The series are first assumed to be uniformly convergent ; and it is

shown that if this assumption were true, all the characteristic exponents
of the periodic solutions (which arise when A, is commensurable with Aj)
Avould be zero. Since this is not the case, the assumption must be false

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and thus the result is obtained, that Lindstedt's series do not converge
uniformly for all values of the arbitrary constants of integration which

they contain.

     The author next discusses the nature of the integrals of the differential
equations, other than those integrals which are already known.

     The system

                    ^a-j_cF dyi__cF .^_j ^n

                    dt cy' dt                     ixj

has an inte'g&r'al

                       =F(ri'i, Xo, 2/1) 2/2) constant.

Suppose, if possible, that another integral exists of the form

                       =yu^(i«i, a-'2.            constant,
                                            2/2)

where cp is a uniform analytic function of fi, ,t,, x.^, 2/1, y-z, and is periodic
in yi and y.y, of period 27r. It is proved that in this case the equations

                       SF 8F gF                           gF
                       ~ ~ ~Sxi
                                      Sx.2        83/1    8?/2

                                      If          _8(j)_  Sf"

                       8x'i 8x2 S^i 8^2

 shown that these equations must be satisfied identically ; thus </» is a

function of F, and so the two integrals (^ and F are not distinct.

      Hence the result. The system possesses no integral (other than the
integral F), which is a uniform analytic function of ,t,, x.2, y,, z/o, A' for
all values of i/, and y^, for small values of fi, and for values of x^ and x^
contained within certain limits, and which is periodic in y^ and 2/2-

      This forms an important complement to Bruns's result, which will be

 reviewed in the next section of this report.
      The last section of Poincare's memoir is occupied with the extension

of the results, which have been obtained for systems with two degrees of
freedom, to more general systems, i.e. to the problem of n bodies.

      Poincare's paper gave a fresh stimulus to the investigation of periodic

solutions. In 1890 v. HaerdtP calculated numerically two cases of the
restricted problem of three bodies. Charlier - in 1892 discussed the same
cases by means of expansions proceeding in ascending powers of the time,
and the same author ^ in 1893 found a set of periodic solutions of the
problem of three bodies in a plane, whose expansion involves four arbi-

trary constants ; the mutual distances of the bodies are given as series of

ascending powers of a quantity

                     + - +{a"- a"~ 2a' cos {\t £)} '-,

the coefBcients in the series being constants.
     Callandreau^ in 1891 discussed the equations which lead by successive

approximations to solutions differing but little from periodic solutions.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      _
     Lord Kelvin '' in 1892 traced by graphic methods a looped orbit, which

may be regarded as a continuation of the set of periodic solutions which
Hill believed to be terminated by the moon of maximum lunation.

     Coculesco*^ in 1892 proved the stability (in both Hill's and Poisson's
senses) of the motion in one of the cases treated by v. Haerdtl. The
motion of the same system, under fresh conditions of projection, was
investigated in 1894 by Burrau ^ ; in the second paper he considers those
purely libratory motions in which the zero particle does not, in the rela-
tive movement, circulate round either of the other bodies, and finds that
the series of solutions is terminated by an orhit of ejection, in which the
zero particle stai'ts from a colHsion with one of the other bodies. These
libratory orbits were further discussed in 1895 by Thiele,^ and (by use of

Poincare's theory) by Perchot ^ and Mascart.

     Poincare's method for the direct calculation of periodic solutions of

dynamical systems was modified in 1895 by Kobb/ so as to be applicable

to the problem of three bodies.
     Darwin in 1896 published a preliminary notice- of a paper ^ which

appeared in 1897, and in which a large number of periodic solutions are
calculated numerically. The case considered is the restricted problem of
three bodies ; two of the bodies, S and J, revolve round each other in

Pcircular orbits, and the mass of tho third body is zero. Darwin finds
Psix families of periodic orbits ; in one (Planet A), describes a closed

path round S, as in Hill's periodic orbit ; in two others (oscillating Satel-

lites a and h) P oscillates about a position on the line joining S and J, as

in the libratory motions of Burrau, Thiele, and Perchot and Mascart ; and

in the remaining three (Satellites A, B, C), P describes a closed path

round J. In the numerical work, the mass of S is supposed to be ten

times the mass of J. When difierent values are assumed for the constant

of energy, the orbits of these families change their form, pass from
stability to instability and vice versa, and even go out of existence

altogether.

     Another class of periodic solutions of the restricted problem of three
bodies was found in 1898 by Schwarzschild.''

    An application of Poincare's theories in a different direction was made

in 1893 by Perchot.'' In the first part of his memoir the coefficients of
the principal periodic inequalities of the longitudes of the lunar node and

perigee are calculated ; the author takes the equations in Delaunay's
form, and applies the theory of periodic solutions. In the second part,
the secular variations of the eccentricities and inclinations are discussed,
with the aid of Poincare's theory of stability.

     The theories of periodic solutions, characteristic exponents, asymptotic
solutions, and the non-existence of uniform integrals were somewhat
more completely discussed in 1892 by Poincare'' himself in the first
volume of his treatise on the new developments of dynamical astronomy.
The second volume, which was published in 1893, and contains a good
deal of matter which had not appeared in the memoir of 1891, opens with
a chapter on asymptotic expansions ; after this the author discusses, by

Jacobi's method, Lindstedt's theory of the solution of the equations of

dynamics by means of sums of periodic terms, using his own proof of its
applicability, as given originally in C. R. cviii. Newcomb's method is
shown to be fundamentally equivalent to Lindstedt's. Lindstedt's theory

is then applied, firstly, to prove a result obtained by Poincare ^ in ' C. E,.'

theory as sums of periodic terms, and, secondly, to effect the general
expansions in the problem of three bodies ; as explained in the paper
referred to, there is a difficulty here, since in Kepler's ellipse the node
and perihelion are fixed, and thus there is a linear relation between the
mean motions of the arguments used. This difficulty is surmounted, and
another is considered in the following chaptei', arising from the fact that
if the eccentricities are very small (supposing that e is used as one of the
variables, and not e cos ns and e sin ro-), some of the developments bi-eak
down. It is shown that this difficulty can be avoided by taking as starting-

point a periodic solution instead of Kepler's ellipse.

     The author then proceeds to discuss the convergency of Lindstedt's
expansions ; his results in this connection were disputed by Hill, ^ and led
to some controversy.

     After some interesting I'emarks on the theorem of the secular invaria-
bility of the mean distances, Poincai'e pi'oceeds to show how the coefficients
in Lindstedt's series can be calculated directly, without the complicated
transformations which were introduced in the proof of their existence

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and then a new way of forming Lindstedt's series is explained, in which
half of the original equations of motion are replaced by the equation of
energy and certain equations involving an auxiliary function S. Two

equalities which can be used in the verification of these pi'ocesses were
given in 1895.^

     The first half of the book may be said to centre round a theorem,
which may be stated as follows :

      Let the equations of dynamical astronomy be given in the form

Ht-^^^      Tx: ^'-^' -^ ·       '^h
dt-fy!

The function F is periodic in the quantities y, and may depend on the x-'s

in any manner. Moreover, certain of the terms are small in comparison

with others, and the order of magnitude of the different terms may be put
in evidence by introducing a small quantity ju, and developing F in

ascending powers of /(, in the form

                           F=Fo + /<F, + ^2F,+-...

Fq does not involve the quantities y.
     Then it is proved that the equations (1) can be formally satisfied by

series of the form

where the quantities .x-/"' and i//'' are periodic functions of the quantities

constants (called the mean viotions) which can be developed as power-
series in jj. The quantities x/'' and 2//"' can themselves be developed in

series of the form

     +(3) .r/''(or ^/'')=^A cos («iiW, +m2?«2+ · · · +'",.w',, A).

     Suppose for simplicity that n^2. If the ratio of the mean motions

is commensurable, one of                               the  terms            of  the  series  (3)  becomes  infinite
                                                                                                                                            ;

leaving this case, it is shown (pp. 96, 97) that incommensurable values of

--the ratio of the mean motions can be sorted into two categories those

for which the series converges and those for which the series diverges

and in every interval, however small, there are values of the first category,

and also values of the second category ; in particular, the series converges

for incommensurable values whose square is commensurable. The con-

vergence is in no case uniform. By an artifice, howevei-, the series (3)

can be regarded as composed of only a finite number of terms, and so the

series (2) can be formed.

    What may be regarded as the second half of the book begins, in the

sixteenth chapter, with an introduction to Gylden's theory ; the Gylden-
Lindstedt equation is treated by the methods of chapter ix. and by those

of Gylden, Bruns, Hill, and Lindstedt ; and then the author proceeds to
the more difficult of Gylden's differential equations. The last three

chapters of the volume are devoted to an exposition of Bohlin's method,

and to an extension in which some of the limitations of Bohlin's work

are removed.

     The theorem regarding the expression of the coordinates as trigono-

metric series was still fui'ther improved' by Poincare in 1897. It is

shown that the coordinates in the problem of three bodies can be expressed

by series proceeding in ascending powers of a small parameter /.t of the

order of the two small masses, and of several constants p of the order of

the eccentricities and inclinations. These series are periodic functions of

five arguments :

Here -ro-j, wg, fj, £21 £3 ^^'6 constants of integration ; n^, n.^, arev^, r.^, i',,

functions of /:, the quantities p, and two other constants z^ and z.j, and
can be expanded as power-series in ji and the quantities p- ; the coeffi-

cients in the series depend on z^ and z.,. The quantities n-^ and n., may be

called the mean motions of the planets ; z^ and ;:/ may be called their mean

distances                                      m^ and  ·zr-j correspond  to  their  longitudes     at  the  epoch,  the
                                            ;

quantities p to the eccentricities and inclinations, the quantities w to the

longitudes of the perihelia and nodes. The development of ra, and n., in

powers of jj. commences with terms of order 0, while the development of

''d  ''i')     commences with                          terms  of         oi'der one, so the w's vary quickly and

            ''s

the w's vary slowly. Terms whose arguments are compounded of the w's

only may, by analogy with the older theories, be called secular terms.

Poisson's theorem on the invariability of the mean distances, in its new

interpretation, is proved in the course of the paper. The mutual distances

of the bodies depend only on the differences of the above five arguments.

I'ROGRESS OF THE SOLUTION OF THE fROBLEM OF THREE BODIES. 155

1898-9. The first half of it is devoted to the theory of Invariant
Integrals, which is given here in a more developed form than in the
memoir of 1890 ; while the second half is concerned chiefly with the
theory of periodic solutions of the second kind. Since the publication of
the 1890 memoir, periodic solutions had been connected by the author'
witli the theory of least action. In the first of the two notes referred to
it is shown that the existence of periodic solutions of different kinds can
be inferred from the principle of least action, when the law of attraction
is .some inverse power of the distance higher than the square ; in the
second note, a classification of unstable periodic solutions is made, which
depends on the principle of least action ; and it is shown that when the
constants of the motion are varied, a periodic solution cannot pass from
one kind of instability to the other. In this volume, the theory of least

action is further applied.

      After developing the theory of periodic solutions of the second kind,
Poincare shows that some of the results of Darwin's paper of 1897 are in

accordance with his own theorems, and criticises others ; and terminates

the book by a study of doubly-asymptotic solutions.
     Since 1892 Brown- has published several memoirs dealing with the

lunar theory on the plan projected by Hill. The first paper extends
Hill's paper of 1878 by including in the work the inequalities which
involve the sun's parallax ; in other woi'ds, Hill found periodic solutions
of the motion of a particle in a plane under the influence of two bodies
which revolve round each other in circular orbits, and whose distance
apart is infinite, while Brown supjaoses this distance to be finite. In the
second paper the inequalities dependent on the moon's eccentricity are
included, i.e. the general solution of Hill's problem, which of course is
not periodic, is found. The investigations of the thii'd paper relate to the
more general pi-oblem of the moon's motion, and include a deduction and
extension of the theorems of Adams's memoir of 1878. (See § IV.) Brown

is at present preparing a complete numerical lunar theory.

     In 1895 HilP calculated numerically the periodic solution, which may

be taken as the base of the lunar theory, and in 1896 Liapounow^ dis-
cussed Hill's series, and proved their convergence in the case of the actual
motion of the moon.

     Andoyer"' in 1890 gave another method for finding the solution of the
differential equations of Dynamical Astronomy by means of series of

periodic terms. He obtains the series directly by assuming that they are

of the required form but with undetermined coefficients, aiid finds these

coefficients by successive approximation. It is shown that the mean dis-

tances of the planets contain no long-period terms of orders zero or one,

which corresponds to the theorem of the invariability of the mean distances.

The same author^ in 189G showed that a theorem analogous to the invari-
ability of the mean distances can be obtained for a general class of
dynamical systems.

     The solution of canonical systems of equations by series was discussed

in 1891-2 by Wand ^ ; suggestions for dii-ecting the approximations in the

problem of 7i bodies were published in 1891 by Laska,^ and in 1897 by
Kovesligethy,'' and (for solving the differential equation for the mean
distance) in 1893 by Gylden.' The first pai-t of a paper*' published by

Newcomb in 1895 contains a solution of the problem of three bodies based

on continued approximation. Hill ^ in 1893 and 1897 showed how, by
dividing the potential function otherwise than in the old theories, an inter-
mediate orbit may be obtained which is free from the disadvantages of
Kepler's ellipse ; and Krassnow * in 1898-9 obtained an intermediate
orbit for the moon, making the suppositions of the restricted problem of

three bodies, by integrating a Hamilton- Jacobi partial differential equation,
in which small quantities of the third order are neglected.

     Painleve ^ in 1896 showed that the problem of three bodies can be
integrated by means of series of polynomials, convergent for all values of
t, except when the initial conditions are such that two of the bodies collide
after a finite interval of time. The same author i" in 1897 showed that
the conditions which must be satisfied in order that, after a finite interval

of time, two of the bodies may collide, cannot be algebraical conditions.
     Brown '^ in 1897 discussed the properties of the general solution in

trigonometric series of the problem of three bodies, by supposing it to
have been derived by integrating the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Several

properties of the constants of the solution are deduced, including those

previously given by Newcomb. In a second paper,'- the same method is
applied to the Lunar Theory, and Adams's theorems on the constant part of

PROGRESS OF THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THREE liODIES. 157

the lunar parallax, in the generalised form pre\'iously given by the author,
are shown to be simple deductions from a single equation.

Researches relating to the convergence of the trigonometric series of

dynamical astronomy were published in 1896 by Charlier ^ and in 1S98 by

mPoincaro.2 The former, by expanding in descending powers of          the

coefficient of the mt\\ term in such a series, arrived at the conclusion that

the convergence can be augmented by dividing the function expressed into
two parts, one of which depends on the first terms in these expansions of
the coefficients. In Poincare's paper the author first connects the series of
the older theories, in which the time occurs explicitly, with the new

expansions, and then observes that the slow convergence of the latter

is to some extent compensated for by the fact that the terms can be
grouped together in such a way that, although the individual terms of a

group may be large, yet their sum is small. The latter part of the
paper is devoted to showing how the expansions which represent periodic

and asymptotic solutions can be derived from the general expansions.

             § VII. The ImjMssibility of Certain Kinds of Integrals.

     Poincare's theorem on the non-existence of uniform integrals of the
problem of three bodies, other than those already known, has already
been reviewed in § VI. Before the publication of Poincare's memoir,
however, an important theorem on the non-existence of algebraic integrals
had been obtained by Bruns.^

     In Bruns's paper, the differential equations of the problem are first
taken, in their unreduced form, as a system of the Gwth order ; they can
be written

    J^=y-. ^''=/(^i> X,, . . . x^,,, c), (r=l, 2, . . . 3,,)

where c denotes the sum of all the mutual distances of the bodies ; the

/reason for introducing c is that the quantities are rational functions of

£c,, a;,, . . . x^n, c, whereas they would be irrational functions of
a;,, 032, x-^n alone, c is a function of the cc's, given as a root of an

algebraical equation.

     Bruns supposes that this system of equations possesses an integral of

-4=^the form ^(a;,, x^, . . . x^,,, y^, y.^, . . . y^^), where  and where ^

is an algebraic function of its arguments. <p must therefore be a root of

an algebraic equation whose coefficients are rational functions of the

quantities a-, y, and which we may take to be irreducible. On differen-

tiating this, it appears that either the coefficients of the algebraic equation

in ^ are themselves integrals, or else (p satisfies an equation of lower

degree, whose coefficients are rational in the quantities x, y, c. In this
way it is proved that all integrals which are algebraic functions of the

quantities x and y are algebraic combinations of other integrals which

Weare themselves rational functions of the quantities x, y, and q.    need

therefore only consider this latter class of integrals. It is shown that

integrals of this class can be compounded of another kind of integrals,

called by Bruns homogeneous. When a homogeneous integral is resolved

into factors which are rational integral functions of the quantities y, it

appears that each of these factors either is itself an integral or can be

made into an integral by associating certain factors with it ; and so,
finally, every integral of the problem of n bodies which is algebraic in the

variables x, y, and is independent of t, can be compounded algebraically

from integrals of a very special class, which are rational integral functions

of the quantities y, and rational functions of the quantities x and c, and

which are, moreover, homogeneous. It is further shown that if <^ denote

an integral of this last class, and ^o denote the terms in it which are of

highest order in the quantities y, then ipo involves the .x's rationally and

--integrally, and only by means of the expressions (y^ x,.  andy,. x-^),  (p^

does not involve e.

  WNow let A, B, C be the three components of angular momentum of

the system, let L', M', be the three components of linear momentum,

Nlet L, M, be the coordinates of the centre of gravity, and let

A'=MN'-NM', B'=LN'-L% C'=LM'-L'M

all these quantities are supposed to be expressed in terms of the quanti-

ties X and y, so that any one of them equated to a constant represents
one of the known integrals of the system of differential equations. Then
it is shown that 0q involves the variables x only in the combinations
A, B, C, A', B', C, and is a rational integral function of A, B, C, A', B', C,

and the y's, ; and then (^q is proved to be a rational integral function of

NA, B, C, A', B', C, L', M', , T, say

(/,o=/(A, B, C, A', B', C, L', M', N', T).

-- U UNow let
--be the potential energy of the system, so T                  is an

integral. Then the quantity

J=/(A, B, C, A', B', C, L', M', N', T-U)

is also an integral, since it is compounded solely of integrals ; and when
it is arranged according to powers of the variables y it coincides with the
integral f in the terms of highest degree. The difference

is therefore an integral of the same kind as <^, except that its degree in

the variables y is at least one unit lower than the degree of in these
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <t>

variables. Thus any integral <p can be made to depend on the known

integrals and an integral of lower degree in the y's : proceeding in this
way, (p can be made to depend on the known integrals and an integral of
the same kind as 4>, but of zero degree in the y's ; but such an integral
would be a constant. Thus Bruns arrives at the theorem : In the jJrohlem
of n bodies, the only integrals which involve the coordinates and velocities
algebraically, and which do not involve the time explicitly, are comjMunded

of the integrals of the centre of gravity, of angular momentum, and of

energy.

     Bruns then proceeds to the reduction of the differential equations of
the problem of three bodies which has already been given in § 1 of this
report, and shows that the system of the 6th order at which he arrives has
PROGRESS OF THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THREE BODIES. 159

no algebraic integrals, and that it is not possible by any algebraic trans-
formation which leaves the canonical form of the equations unaltered to
obtain any further separation of the variables analogous to the elimina-

tion of the nodes.

     In the second part of the paper (pp. 67-96), the author first, by an
easy extension of the previous result, shows that no integrals exist which
involve the time and the variables algebraically, except the known
integrals, and then finds the integral-equations of the reduced system of
equations for the problem of three bodies, i.e. functions of the variables
whose derivatives with respect to the time vanish when the functions
themselves vanish ; and shows that the only integral-equation is the one
whose vanishing expresses the condition that the motion takes place in
one plane.

     The author then discusses the question, whether any integrals of the
reduced system exist in the form of integi-als of algebraic total differen-
tials, i.e. the generalised Abelian integrals which have since been studied
by Picard. This also is shown to be impossible ; and, lastly, this result
can be extended to the problem of n bodies, since, if such an integral
existed for the problem of n bodies, a corresponding integral for the pro-
blem of three bodies could be derived by equating all but three of the
masses to zero.

   A defect in Bruns's proof (pp. 37 sqq. of Bruns's paper) was pointed out

and remedied by Poincare ^ in 1896.
     Gravd^ in 1896 showed that the differential equations of the problem

of three bodies, in the form given by Bertrand, possess no integrals inde-
pendent of the law of attraction other than those already known ; and
Painlev^^ in 1897-8 extended Bruns's result, by showing that every
integral of the problem of n bodies which involves the velocities alge-
braically (whether the coordinates are involved algebraically or not) is

an algebraic combination of the known integrals of energy and momentum

     (Secretary), appointed to report on the Present State of our Know-
      ledge in Elecirolj/sis and JLlectro-chemistrij.

     The conductivity of a number of salts in very dilute aqueous solution
at the freezing point of water has been determined by Mr. Whetham, while
Mr. Griffiths has concurrently made observations of the freezing point for
corresponding solutions. The observations of conductivity extend to
solutions of sulphuric acid, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, barium

chloride, copper sulphate, potassium permanganate, potassium bichromate,
and potassium ferricyanide. The range of dilution is, speaking generally,

from below the hundred-thousandth to about the twentieth part of a gram
equivalent per thousand grams of solution.

     The water used was specially distilled three times, and finally
from a platinum still, and collected in platinum vessels. Its approximate
conductivity was about \1 xlO"^^ at 18° C. in C.G.S. units. The best
water obtained by Kohlrausch by distillation in vacuo had a conduc-
tivity of 0'2 X 10"^° in the same units at the same temperature.

     The results obtained this year, while confirming those described at the
last meeting of the Association for solutions of moderate concentrations,
show differences when great dilutions are reached, but the constancy of
the present measurements shows that the water now used is good enough
to enable trustworthy values to be obtained even at the lowest limits of
dilution above mentioned.

     Mr. Griffiths has remodelled his apparatus for determination of freezing

points, and is now able to carry the measurements of temperature to a

higher degree of accuracy than hitherto.

    As .soon as the observations are completed it is intended to publish

the results of both investigations together.

    No further progress has been made with the rest of the Report.

       I. Oil Seismological Stations already established.

Instruments of the same type have been forwarded to the followinpf

--twenty- three stations : Shide, Kew, Toronto, Victoria, B.C., San Fernando

'(Spain), IMadras, Bombay, Calcutta, Batavia, Mauritius, Cape Town,

Arequipa, Strathmore College (Philadelphia), Tokio, Cordova (Argentina),

New Zei,land (two instruments), Cairo, Paisley, Mexico, Beyrout, Hono-

lulu, and the last to Trinidad.

     It is expected that shortly instruments will be installed in Ireland,

New South Wales, and Victoria, and your Secretary has had correspondence

about the establishment of seismographs in other countries.

The following Report contaijis registers from the first eleven of the

above-mentioned stations, and reports from several of the remainder are

·expected to arrive shortly,

     The principal analysis of these registers has been made in reference to
the one from Shide, but as many earthquakes have been recorded which

did not reach that station, but were common to groups of observatories in

other parts of the world, it is evident that if similar analyses are made in

reference to other localities, our knowledge respecting the distribution of

seismic disturbances will be largely increased. Should any of the observers

who have forwarded copies of their observations to Shide consider it

advisable to undertake this work, it is hoped that this report will be of

assistance in carrying out the same.

     The Committee thank the Directors of observatories in Italy, Germany,
and R,ussia for copies of recoixls corresponding to those obtained in Shide.
For the purpose of seeing the installation in the Isle of Wight and dis-

cussing records, Shide has been visited by Colonel Gore, ]i.E., of the

Trigonometrical Survey of India, Mr. R. D. Oldham, of the Geological
Survey of that country, Dr. Figee, in charge of the instrument in Batavia,

     The continuity of records obtained from this station has largely been
<lcpendent upon the interest shown in the work Ijy Shinobu Hirota, Mr.

Milne's assistant.

     At rare intervals, usually in consequence of some irregularity in the

band of bromide paper, the clock driving the same has been stopped.
Failure.s due to this cau.se have been extremely few. The greater number
of failures arise from 'air tremors,' which during the winter months, in
frosty weather, and at night are frequent. Slight continuous movements

of the boom produced by these air currents have no doubt eclipsed many
amall earthquakes, and have certainly hidden the commencement of larger

disturbances. These difficulties, which occur from time to time, and
interfere with observations for at least one month out of twelve, are not
likely to be overcome until the instrument is moved to a larger and better

\entilated room.

    A pair of horizontal pendulums recording on .smoked paper have

given records of the periods of earth vibrations.

--166 REPORT 1899.

     In its original form the above List did not contain records numbered

170, 173, 176, 177, 178, 190, 191, 198, 204, 205, 206, 208, 209, 211, 212,

266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 27l, and 272. The reason for the omission was
that these records were so small that it was not considered likely that
they would be recorded at other stations. I call them the subsidiar^y

list.

     Between March 18 and 21 the original list was sent to stations No. 1
to_ 19,' and also to Strassburg, Padua, Rome, Eocca di Papa, Casa-
micciola, Catania, Potsdam, Nicolaiew, Edinburgh and Bidstone.

    On April 14 the subsidiary was forwarded to Cadiz, Bombay, Toronto,

Potsdam, Rome, Rocca di Papa, Catania, Paisley and Kew.
    The responses have, when necessary, been reduced to Greenwich mean

civil time, and are contained in the following tables :

Kew has met with difficulties in common with Shide, but the tremors

Whyhave not been so frequent or pronounced.              certain earthquakes like

Nos. 196, 207, 214, 220, 221, 225, 246, 247, <L-c., M-ere not recorded, whilst

the amplitudes of large earthquakes are smaller than the same at Shide

and at the same time show phases of maxima movements farther separated

in time than they appear to be at the latter place, is difficult to under-

stand. The most likely explanation is that at Kew the foundations of

the instruments rise from an extremely thick bed of soft tertiary materials

more or less saturated with water, whilst at Shide the piers rise from the

surface of upended beds of comparatively hard, diy chalk.

means that the full width of the line {not the half width) was -2 mm. when

--would be \ (-4 '2), or -1 mm. On the other hand, when it is said either

= =that ' max. amplitude 0-9 mm.,' or ' amplitude 5-5 mm.,' it is meant

that the half width of the central line was 9 in the former and 5-5 in

the latter case. The true amplitude would be in the former case, say,
0'9-- .T, when 2.r was the undisturbed width of the line, whatever that

might be at the time.

At Kew variations in the full width of the line from -1 to -3 mm. are

noticed.

    When first installed the instrument at this station showed but few-
movements of the ground, and these were slight. On April 27, 1899, it

was therefore dismounted, but set up again on the same day ; the position
of the balance weight being slightly altered and a more perfect equilibrium

of the boom assured. Its period is 16 seconds. Now it appears to work

better, but the vibrations are not very intense as compared with those

from other localities. This lack of sensitiveness may. Commodore
Viniegra remarks, be due to the foundations, in which there are several
'stone furrows,' surrounded with mud.

     Dr. C. H. Michie Smith writes as follows :

     ' The instrument is placed in the old magnetic room of the Observa-
tory on one of the old piers. The surrounding ground is mainly a stiff
clay which cracks during the hot weather, leaving fissures many inches
deep. The Observatory is on a plain, and is about three miles from the

sea and 20 feet above sea level. No air tremors were experienced during

the time under i-eport, but the instrument gave a great deal of trouble
specially owing to changes in the length of the suspending silk thread,

caused probably by alterations in the amount of moisture in the air. The
instrument will be removed to Kodaikanal as soon as a room is ready

for it.'

7. Bovihmj: Colaba. Abstract from Beport by ^. K. F. Moos, Esq., Director of
                                          the Government Observatory.

The instrument at the Bombay Government Observatory is installed

in a small isolated building 10 feet square and 14 feet up to the eaves,

which was formerly used for electrostatical observations. It has a gable

roof, and is well ventilated on all sides. On the west side, at a distance

of 40 feet, is a carriage drive leading to the Directors' quarters, and at a

distance of 70 feet in the same direction, and parallel to the drive, is the

main road outside the Observatory compound. On the east side, there is

to a distance of GO feet open ground as far as the thermograph shed,

beyond which an open tract continues to the sea. On the north side

there is a small well and open ground for 120 feet, where the observers'

quarters arc situated. Probably in consequence of a copious ventilation,

no troubles have been experienced with the so-called earth tremors.

The pier is oriented N.S. and E.W., and located in the centre of the

room. Its foundation was dug 5^ feet below the flooring of the room,

which is \h feet above the ground^. At this depth a huge boulder was
struck, upon which was laid a bed of concrete 5x5 feet square and 2 feet
4x4deep. Over this a mass of rubble masonry
                                                                                                                                               feet and l\ feet thick

was built, .and upon this a brick pillar U, feet square and 5^ feet high.

On the top of this there is 1 inch of cement and a i-inch marble slab.

On the north side to carry the clock box there is a heavy table 3 feet

9 inches square. The Observatory stands on somewhat elevated ground

formed of basaltic traps, with their inter-trappean beds of hard red earth.

     The records commence on September 8, 1898. The period of the boom

has been kept at 18 sees., the sensibility being such that a deflection of

1 mm. corresponds to a.tilt of 0-38". No difficulties have been experi-

 enced in the working of the instrument beyond an occasional .slight falling

 of the boom, due, perhaps, to a stretching of the silk thread at the upper
 end of the tie. The sensibility is determined weekly by observation and
. by deflections whilst the film is in the box, thus preserving a photographic

record of the same. By stretching a fine wire across the slit in the clock

box an accurate zero line is obtained.

     Regular tremors and pulsations are absolutely absent.

     The list on the next page only contains records which correspond with
records obtained in the Isle of \Vight. The complete Bombay Catalogue,

commencing on September 8, 1898, to June 2, 1899, contains 2,021 entries.

These refer to shocks which were local, and do not appear to have reached
Europe, curious irregular sinuosities varying in period from a few minutes

to an hour, sudden displacements or dislocations in the position of the
boom, and numerous thickenings of the normal record. The latter, in

some instances, may be the result of slight earth tremors, but where they

are continuous over several hours and have an irregular, bead-like
appearance, it is likely that they are due to air currents. Movements

due to such causes are most frequent at night. The cause of the sinuosi-
ties and sudden displacements is at present unknown.

     In an official report on the condition and proceedings of the Colaba
Observatory, dated April 29, 1899, in reference to Seismology, Mr. Moos

says, that the seismograph appears to give every satisfaction. At first

tremors were absolutely absent, but they appeared in the middle of
November, and subsequently caused great trouble. To arrive at the

causes producing these tremors, Mr. Moos has instituted a series of experi-
     ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  177

ments, and he has found it possible to suppress their existence by regulating
the temperature and draught in the room by four small kerosine lamps
kept burning between 8 p.m. and 9 a.m. The introduction of these lamps
also results in giving the zero of the boom a fluctuation almost analogous

to that observed in the diurnal wave.

     {(') That air tremors occur every night, in spite of every precaution to
ensure copious ventilation, and the prevention of convection currents.
They begin at sunset with small movements, which rapidly become larger,
but, although of variable amplitude during the night, do not show a marked

maximum : they finally die away at sunrise. As a general rule the
tremors are greatest when the fall of temperature during the night is

greatest ; but this is not always the case.

exceeds the easterly, indicating a gradual sinking of the land west of the

instrument.

   We must conclude that this movement is only local, for if the whole

island tilted in this way as a rigid body, land would appear on the east
coast, which was previously submerged, and vice verm on the west coast,
and up to now I have been unable to obtain evidence that such a thing

has taken place.
     (e) That the earthquake effects are comparatively small, as -will be

seen from an inspection of the accompanying list. This makes us question
v/hether it is possible for the ocean to act as a damper to earthquake shocks.

     V7ben records are forthcoming from Honolulu we may leai'n more of

this subject.

     Beside the above five phenomena, there is another interesting poiat to

be considered : the variation in the scale value of the instrument. As
tlie boom points to the north, an increased sensibility means that tlie
boom pillar has tilted towards the south, and vicn versa.

     In the following table will be found the smoothed scale values for

every four days from 1898, October, to 1899, January. (A bar represents
an adjustment.)

     The instrument was mounted on a concrete pier based on a rock
foundation, and was experimentally started on June 20, 1899.

    At first difficulties were experienced in attaining the necessary amount

of sensitiveness. Thei'e appeared to he a large amount of friction which
prevented the boom swinging freely. This, however, was remedied by a
7-eadjustment of the balance weights, and the instrument has been re-

cording with occasional interruption since July li.

                                            21. Hawaii: Honolulu.

     On February 19, 1898, the trustees of the Elizabeth Thompson Science
Fund assigned me a grant of ^250 in aid of a seismic survey of the world.

This was expended in purchasing a horizontal pendulum, which was

shipped to the care of H.M.'s Consul-General, W. J. Kenny, in Hawaii,
When Mr. Kenny left Honolulu in March 1899, tlie instrument was
handed to Professor Maxwell, who will work in conjunction with Pro-

fessor Alexander and Professor Hosmer (Principal of the Government
High School), and the latter, I understand, will kindly make arrangements
for its installation. Professor George Davidson, Chairman of a Committee
appointed by the Council of the University of California to undertake
Seismic Investigations, writes me that Mr. Bishop of Honolulu has promised
a site for the instrument, and that Professor Alexander will see that it is
placed in working order. It is hoped that by next year a series of records

will have been obtained from this exceedingly important station. Copies
of the report based upon these records should be sent to the Secretary of
the Board of Trustees of the Elizabeth Thompson Science Fund, Harvard
Medical School, Boston, Mass., through the liberality of which body the
Hawaiian Station has been established.

                                                          22. E(/ypt : Cairo.

     Captain H. G. Lyons, R.E., Director- General of the Sur\e\' Depart-
ment, writes on June 2, 1899, that owing to structural alterations and
other causes, it has not been possible to commence continuous observations
with the seismograph. The instrument was handed to him in February
last, and in about three months' time observations will commence.

  23. U.S.A. : P/iiladelp/iia, Swart/imore Colkffc. Professor S. J. Cuxnixgham.

    When observations commenced at this station Professor Cunningham

experienced great trouble with 'air tremors,' but from the excellent
character of the seismogram for the Mexican earthquake of January 24,
1899, it is anticipated that these difficulties have been overcome, but no
report has been received.

                          III. Discussion of tJie j^receding Registers.

     Although in the following discussions a few disturbances are referred
to in detail, all that is given for the majority are the time entries.

The first of these refers to the instant when motion commenced at various
stations. It is the commencement of the preliminary tremors referred to
as P.T.'s. In the Milne H.P. records these are usually shown as a mere
thickening of the line. If there is no entry in this first column it means
that heavy motion commenced suddenly, or else in consequence of move-
ments due to air currents the commencement of the P.T.'s was not deter-
minable. The duration of these first P.T.'s, wliich are regarded as com-

pressional Avaves which have travelled through the earth, is given where it
is possible in tlie second column. These quantities are not the same as
those given in the Shide Register, which refer to the duration of all
movement from the commencement up to the maximum. The time of

the maximum, which is not the time when the largest group of waves
appears, but a point usually midway between this commencement and end,
is noted in the third column. The diff"erence between the first and tliird
columns gives the duration of all P.T.'s, and corresponds to entries in the
Shide Register. The sum of the first and second columns gives the com-
       ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESriGATION,                          193

m«ncement of the second phase of motion. For the commencement of
other phases of motion, of which there may be several before the
appearance of the largest waves (L.W.'s.), reference must be made to the

seismogram.
     For entries in the first cohimn all records should be fairly comparable.

The entries in the second column are only comparable in those instances
where I have been able to place the seismograms for the stations to which
they refer side by side. Where this has been the case will be seen by
reference to the reproductions of such seismograms. The accuracy of the
determinations of the times given in the third column is dependent upon
conditions which govern the accuracy of the entries in the second column.
If a station reports a series of times for the first, second, third. &c., sudden
increases in range of motion, unless we have the seismograms before us it
is by no means certain that these correspond to phases of movement
whicli have been similarly numbered at a second station.

     The time entries for Potsdam are only given approximately. (See

p. 194.)

     The first illustration of these three-column entries is Earthquake

No. 182.

                                              Determination of Oriyins.

    The methods by which origins may be determined from time observa-

tions are numerous.' The simplest, perhaps, is that of circles, and its

--application is as follows : If the large waves of an earthquake reach

Dstations B, C and four, six and eight minutes after reaching station A,
Athen when they reach the wave fronts are respectively about 600, 900
Dand 1,200 kms. distant from B, C and D. On a globe with B, C and as

centres I draw circles 600, 900 and 1,200 kms. radius. The centre of the

Acircle, found by trial, which passes through and touches the circles round

B, C and D, is the origin required. The assumption is that whilst the

P.T.'s are propagated with variable velocities through the earth, the large
waves traverse the surface of the earth with a velocity that is nearly con-
stant. In this illustration I have assumed this velocity to be 2'5 kms.

per second.

     The observations which support these assumptions are too numerous

to require special reference.

     With times of arrival at only three stations we are left to decide

between two pos'^ible centres. See Earthquake 252.
     In consequence of the want of sufficient records which are .strictly

comparable, no attempt has been made in the present i-eport to determine
origins with any degree of accui'acy.

     As an assistance in these determinations the times at which prelimin-

·ary tremors have been recorded and intervals by which they have outraced
the large waves at various stations are not neglected, whilst the topo-
graphical and geological character of the locality in which the origin
is placed is often an indication as to whether the determinations are

correct.

connected with the throwing up of a small island off the coast of Xorth-

West Borneo, near to Labuan.
     The first of these disturbed an electrometer at Batavia at 7h. 14m. 20s.

P.M., a magnetometer being disturbed two minutes later. These disturb-
ances indicate the arrival of the larger waves, which coming froui Labuan
had travelled about 1,660 kms. The velocity of propagation of these

movements may be taken at about 2-7 kms. per second. With this

assumption the conclusion is that this earthquake originated at about
7h. 4m. 20s. p.m., the time to travel to Batavia having been 10 minutes.

     The effect of the second earthquake was to disturb a magnetometer in
Batavia at 5h. 22m. 45s. a.m., which by similar reasoning Jeails to the

conclusion that it originated at about 5h. 13m. a.m. At Sandakan, which

is about 300 kms. from the origin, it was noted at 5h. 18m. a.m., the
inference from which is that the time at the origin would be about
5h. 16m. A.M. The mean between these two determinations gives as an
approximation for the true time at the origin 5h. 14m. 30s. a.m.

G.M.T.) lasting 30s., with an oscillation of 10 centimetres, direction
south-east to north-east, followed by lesser shocks, which continued alto-

     ' The winter throughout Chile has been unusually severe and wet, the

rainfall in May and June having amounted to 22 inches. Seismic

disturbance has been frequent, espf?cially in the neighbourhood of the
Andes, where abnormal quantities of snow have fallen. In several passe.s
of the Cordillera snow has attained the extraordinary depth of from 14 to
18 metres, and postal communication has been entirely stopped vid the

Andine route for close on two months, many hundred bags of postal

matter having been abandoned in the snow lay the carriers, several of

whom lost their lives whilst performing their perilous duties.

     'On the 12th iust. snow fell heavily in Santiago, a very unusual
occurrence, to a depth of between 2 and 3 inches : indeed for twelve
hours the capital presented the appearance of a city of Northern Europe.

early part of this month, caused by excessive rainfall, which was followed
by shocks of earthquake and a severe cyclone, causing considerable destruc-

       ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.     209

     The United Slates Monthly Weather Review for January gives the

following note :

     ' Reports from Mexico describe the earthquake of Monday evening,
January 24, as the severest ever known in the City of Mexico. The first

oscillation began at 9-09 (local time). It was from north-east to south-
west, and lasted Im. 56s. Three minutes later came a second shock,
which lasted 5s., oscillating north-west and south-east. The earthquake

was felt over the entire Republic of Mexico. At Colima it lasted
Im. 20s. ; at Vera Cruz it lasted 10s. But few reports of this earth-

quake have been received from the United States, although it must

have been feebly felt at many stations.

     'At San Barnardino, Cal., a shock was felt at 4.55 p.m.,

January 25. The newspapers of that city state that the shock was of
little greater severity than usual, and that the barometer dropped from
30*12 to 29'86, " an unusual occurrence, kc."'

    Mr. 0. H. Howarth, who is interested in recording earthquakes,
writes to me from Hacienda de Zavalita, Oaxaca, Mexico, as follows :

     ' I think you may be interested to have a local note about the earth-

quake shock which occurred here on Tuesday, January 24, being the
longest and strongest I have yet experienced in this country. The time

Wewas 5.25 A.M., and the duration, as near as I could get it, 20 seconds.

are situated here about 13 miles south-west of the city of Oaxaca, in a
winding cafion, well up into the mountain range : altitude, 6,200 feet.

We seem to be all agreed that the wave approached from the south. The

formation of the whole district here is a very hard gneissic granulite in

which occur the quartz veins with gold. The feature which struck me

most was the sensation (which I have not experienced before), of the
wave grinding its way through a hard resisting medium. Just at the
climax there was a peculiar jerk, as if it had changed its direction, or met
with some exceptional obstruction. The noise was considerable, and
some of our people were on their knees saying their " Ora pro nobis " with

great vigour. One of them told me to watch the clouds, and for three
hours afterwards I noticed heavy mist down upon the high ridge at the

--head of the cafion (8,700 feet), which otherwise we never see at this time

of the year the middle of the dry season. I cannot see any direct
reason for an atmospheric change, but there is no doubt that a big
condensation occurred. The shock seems to have been unusually long
and severe in the city of Mexico (200 miles north from here)
Im. 36s. (this I doubt), and damage was done at some points ; but
probably the accounts which reach England will be exaggerated as

usual.'

On May 29 Mr. Howarth again wrote me, saying that in Oaxaca

where he was (200 miles south from Mexico City), there was a severe

shock at 5.25 a.m., a slight tremor about 11 a.m., and another slight

shock about 5 p.m. In Mexico City this was reversed, the slight shock

being at 5.23 a.m. and the heavy one causing damage about 5 p.m. The

first coming from the south to reach Mexico City would have to traverse

the great range of Popocatepetl, Ixtaccehuall, and Ajusco, by which it

would be absorbed or diverted, and therefore whilst strong in Oaxaca, it

would be feeble in Mexico City. If the second came from the north or

north-west these effects would be reversed. The only effect at Zavalita,
near Oaxaca, on January 24, was to crack walls, and to bring down a load
of loose rock at the entrance to a mine tunnel, and in this way it acted
as a service. In Oaxaca the intensity of local shocks is remarkably

variable at short distances.

    The conclusion we arrive at from the above notes is that we

have to deal with the shock felt severely in Mexico at 5.9 p.m., or at
llh. 45m. 31s. G.M.T. The time at the origin would be about 2m.
earlier than this, or llh. 43m. 31s.

Such, at least, is the conclusion arrived at by the Meteorological Bureau,

though the record of damage done suggests that Nagoya may share the
honour. The time telegraphed from Nagoya is 9.45 a.m., and that tele-
graphed from Osaka 9.56, but it is not possible to place much reliance on
these figures. Nagoya city does not seem to have sufiered. The damage

occurred chiefly at Ono, Handa, and Chirin, where houses are said to have
been overturned. Wakayama, also, was severely visited, houses and go-
downs being overthi'own in the two districts of Nishi-mura and Higashi-
mura. The most accurate accounts come from Osaka. There the direction

of the shock was from south-east to north-west. At first vertical, the

movement presently became horizontal, the latter phase, which lasted
about two minutes, developing the maximum intensity. Apparently the

only personal injuries were not directly due to the shock, but resulted

from a panic among the employees at the Osaka Cotton- spinning Factory.
In attempting to escape from an upper story, several fell downstairs, and
twenty-eight were hurt, two severely. Fuller details may show, however,

that the falling of chimneys and buildings was not unaccompanied by loss

of life.

     ' Considering the wide area through which the seismic disturbance on

the 7th instant was felt, it is inferred that the origin of the force must
have been at a point very deep below the surface. The great majority of

the earthquakes experienced in this country are of distinctly limited scope.

Thus the statistics collected by the Seismological Bureau show that out of

2,670 shocks felt in 1891, only eight were felt throughout an area of over
10,000 square miles. The great earthquake on August 28 in that year
made itself pei'ceptible throughout an area of 15,750 square miles, and the
shock on the 7th of this month had a range of 15,000 square miles. The

latter did not reach farther north than Yokohama : it was not felt at all

in Tokio.

A' telegram received by the Home Department from Nara Prefecture
-- "Agives details of the damage done by the earthquake :
                                                           strong shock

was felt at 10 a.m. on the 7th. At Takata-machi twenty farmers' houses

fell, and two children were buried in the ruins. At Sakmaimachi a man

was crushed to death. Other damage is in course of investigation."

   A' telegram received subsequently says : " The result of investigation

shows that three persons were killed and 11 injured, 67 houses destroyed

and 24 damaged. The mountains in Amanowawa Mura, Yoshino district,

shook greatly and emitted a thunderous sound, and the ground opened in

parts, landslips occurring here and there. Roads westward of Hirase
have been broken away in places."

     ' Ten workers in the Tenwa mine were buried alive, but were dug out

safely.'
--214 REPORT 1899.

     The velocity of transit for the P.T.'s is not given, because small errors
in the time observations lead to marked discrepancies in the final results.

   A point of interest in the seismograms is that whilst at Shide and

Kew the range of motion was 3 and -8 mm., at Toronto it was only -5,

and at Victoria, the nearest station to the origin (71°), the movement
was barely visible, and so indefinite that certain determinations of time
are impossible. This latter place would be reached along a path entirely
beneath the Pacific, Toronto by a path crossing Behring Straits, and
Shide by a land path across Asia and Europe.

     Observations of this nature suggest that oceanic waters exert a damp-
ing eflFect upon the earth waves traversing their beds.

     Apparently we have two small shocks, and it is difficult to disoriuiinate
between the commencements of the first and the second. For Shide,
Toronto, and Victoria the times of the L.W.'s refer to the second dis-
turbance, which may have originated on the western side of the Atlantic.

                    Earthquakes recorded at Shide and at Distant Stations.

         The preceding table shows the ecarthquakes which were recorded in the
    Isle of Wight and also at distant stations. "When comparing the records

    at one station with those taken at any other station, consideration must

    be given to the dates on which these stations commenced their observa-

    tions. For example, the Kew entries corresponding to those at Shide lie

    between Nos. 195 and 271 or April 25, 1898, and March 25, 1899. Just
    as comparisons may be made between the Isle of Wight list and that from
    Kew, showing that many earthquakes were recorded at the former place
    which were not recorded at the latter, exactly opposite comparisons might

    be made. For example, whilst the above list indicates that Kew only

    recorded forty-two disturbances out of fifty-seven noted at Shide, the
    Kewcomplete register for
                              (p. 166) indicates that at that place seventy-five

    disturbances were noted, and it is possible that more than forty-two of

    these were common to other countries.

    Although the Indian stations have recorded earthquakes which have

also been observed in other parts of the world, in consequence of diffi-

culties largely the result of a tropical environment the value of many

seismograms has been impaired. Until these difficulties have been over-

come the frequency of earthquakes common to India and other parts of

the world can only be imperfectly indicated.

    Although the instruments at Bidston and Edinburgh have yielded

excellent results respecting slow changes in the vertical, and as such are
important adjuncts to a seismological laboratory, yet the above table

indicates that they fail to pick up many earthquakes.

                Analysis of the Table from a Seismometrical Point of Vieiv.

     The last line of the table shows that Kew, Toronto, Victoria,
Bombay (?), Nicolaiew, Potsdam, and Trieste have recorded more earth-
quakes in common with the Isle of Wight than have been recorded at the.
Italian stations. This conclusion is more clearly indicated in the follow-

ing table :

    Out of 57 records at Shide -12, or 73 per cent., are common to Kew

    " ^^

      If the Italian stations are taken .separately the percentage for each is

lower than that for Italy as a whole. When we compare the twenty-four

earthquakes recorded at Shide, Nicolaiew, and Potsdam which lie between
^os. 182 and 250 with those noted in Italy, we see that six of these, viz.
Nos 182, 18o, 210, 231, 248, and 264, apparently escaped observation in

the latter country.

    Again, out of thirteen disturbances noted in Trieste and in the Isle
ot Wight, only SIX of these, viz. Nos. 255, 257, 259, 260, 264, and 266, are
tound in the Italian register. It will also be observed that some of the
shocks which escaped the Italian instruments were well recorded in Toronto,

Victoria, B.C., Batavia, and other places ; and it may be added that
    we except                                                   .

                                         266, the

shocks from Shide, Potsdam, and other places are of marked magnitude.
218 REPORT-- 1899.

    Although it may be suggested that these omissions in the Italian

registers of earthquakes which have spread over large portions of the
world are due to a want of sensibility in the instruments employed in that
country, such an explanation does not accord with the fact that these
same instruments with their frictional indices pick up the small pre-
liminary tremors of large earthquakes with apparently the same exactitude
as the seismographs do which record photographically.

    Whatever may be the true explanation of these lacunce, it must be

remembered that the open diagi-ams from the Italian instruments furnish
information not obtainable from the majority of the photographic appa-
ratus, and they are, therefore, indispensable to fully equipped labora-

tories.

     The following illustrations of seismograms are only to be regarded as
sketches of the original ijhotograms. They show the range of motion and
principal characteristics of wave-groups, but they do not show details like
small serrations clearly exhibited in the records from which they are
derived. The numbers correspond with the numbers given for particular
earthquakes in the preceding text. The arrow with its time-mark gives
the time for a particular phase of movement, which is usually that of the
commencement. The number following the letter S gives the time-scale

in millimetres per hour. Thus S=60 means that 60 millimetres equal

one hour.

IV. Varieties of Earthquakes and their Bespectivs Durations.

     Those who live in a country where earthquakes are frequent must
have observed that the sliocks they feel may at least be divided into two
groups. The members of one of these groups are phenomena characterised

1899.                                                            Q
226 REPORT-- 1899.

by their short duration and by the rapidity of their vibrations. The other
 group, which in Tokio form about 5 per cent, of the whole, can be felt for
several minutes, and the period of movement is long. With many persons
earthquakes having this character produce feelings of nausea, and there is
 abundant evidence to show that they represent undulations of the surface

of the ground. By the former of these groups, although they may some-

 times alarm a city, free horizontal pendulums, unless constructed like a
 bracket seismograph, are seldom disturbed, whilst the latter throw such
instruments into violent and fitful motion which, rather than extending,

over two or three minutes, continues for as many hours.
      One class of earthquake consists of what are practically elastic vibra-

tions, which have a short life and do not travel to great distances from
 their origin, whilst the other class gives rise to surface waves which are-
propagated to very great distances.

     The earthquakes which are merely elastic shiverings may possibly be

represented at their origin by a blow delivered on a small surface, whilst
those which are shiverings accompanied by surface heaving are the result
of collapse in and along an extensive region.

     If we divide earthquakes into these two groups, between which con-
necting links, if they exist, are very rare, we then see an escape from the-

prevalent idea that as earthquakes radiate their duration apparently

increases.

     Although we know that preliminary tremors outrace large waves, that
both of these forms of movement increase in period, and that a single
wave at one station may at a more distant station be represented by two
waves, all of which phenomena tend to the spreading out of a disturbance,
it is difficult to realise that an earthquake recorded in Japan as having a
duration of two or three minutes should, when it reaches this country, be-
represented by movements continuing over two or three hours. The

circumstances which have led to this supposition are twofold. First, no-
distinction has been drawn between the two kinds of earthquakes ; and,
secondly, the duration of a disturbance near to its origin has been deter-
mined by a method very different from that by which it was determined at
a distance.

    When these considerations are neglected the results we may arrive at

are well illustrated in a paper on 'Earthquake Duration' by Dr. E. Odone

We{' Atti della Eeale Accademia dei Lincei,' vol. iv. fas. 10, p. 425).

here find a list of twenty-four earthquakes, the origins of which were at
distances varying between 25 and 11,170 kins, from Rocca di Papa,

Rome, and Siena. At these places the duration of these shocks were-

Anoted by fairly similar seismographs of the heavy pendulum type.

glance at this table apparently indicates that the durations of these earth-
quakes had steadily increased with the distances of their origins from the

observing stations. With an origin at a distance of, say, 25 kms., we find
a duration of about 70 seconds, whilst if the origin was at a distance of

9,000 kms. the duration becomes 4,800 seconds.
     For the first members of this series, which I will call local shocks, had

the instruments employed been free horizontal pendulums it is very
doubtful whether they would ever have been recorded, neither would they
have been noted had the pendulums with their multiplying indices been at

distances of a few hundred kilometres from their origins. The common

experience, based on seismographic records of local shiverings in Jaj^an, is

that the duration of movement decreases with distance from an origin, and
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIOX.  227

it is only very large earthquakes which can be recorded with steady point
seismographs at distances exceeding 300 miles.

     Directly we come to the other members in the list we are apparently
dealing with the duration of earth tilting, and with regard to any par-
ticular earthquake we may ask for information i-especting the duration of
the same near to its origin or at stations between this point and Central
Italy, or in countries further afield. The information we have on these

points is, however, scant, but such as exists is far too definite to be
ignored. For example. Dr. Odone gives in his list the Japan earthquake
of March 22, 1894, on which occasion the seismographs at Rocca di Papa

and at Rome were respectively agitated for Ih. 3m. and Ih. 20m.

      Because the duration of this earthquake as recorded by a bracket
seismograph in Tokio was ten seconds, it must not be assumed that we
have here an illustration of a seismic movement increasing in its dura-
tion as it radiated. On this occasion, after feeling the first heavy move-

ment, I went to my observatory and watched the boom of a horizontal

pendulum follow very irregular heavings of the ground for some fifteen

minutes, when I was joined by my colleague, Mr. C. D. West, and we

continued to watch the erratic, fitful movements for Ih, 47m. longer.

   -- --"VVe have in this instance and others might be quoted distinct

evidence of earth movements near to their oi-igin continuing for a very

much longer period than they were observable at distant localities. What

was noted in Europe were the earthquake precursors or preliminary
tremors, the duration of which increases with distance from an origin,
and, after that, the earthquake echoes with possible traces of waves

which had travelled round the world in a direction opposite to that con-

stituting the maximum phases in the seismograms. In Tokio, although

the preliminary movements were of shorter duration than in Europe, the

total duration of the disturbance in that city, on account of the great

length of the concluding vibrations, seems to have exceeded that which

was recorded in Italy,

      The shiverings of our world recur on the average every thirty minutes,
but the heavy breathing or true ground swell does not happen more than

once a week. Popularly they are both earthquakes, but they diflTer in

their character, in their duration, and probably in their origin, and as

they radiate, their life, as exhibited at stations farther and farther remote

from their origin, rather than increasing becomes less,

                                      V. Earthquake Echoes.

    (This and the following Section are in part abstracted from Notes published in
                              'Nature,' February 16 and March 1, 1899.)

    An earthquake disturbance as recorded at a station far removed from

its origin shows that the main movement has two attendants, one which
precedes and the other which follows. The first of these by its charac-
teristics indicates what is to follow, whilst the latter in a very much
more pronounced manner will often repeat at definite intervals but with
decreasing intensity the prominent features of what has passed. Inas-
much as these latter rhythmical but decreasing impulses of the dying
earthquake are more likely to result from reflection than from interference
I have provisionally called them Echoes.

    When an earthquake is comparatively small, and has originated as a

single effort at no great distance (one or two thousand miles) from the
                                                                                                Q2

observing station, the seismogram shows a single set of iDreliminary tremors,

of 3hort duration, a single set of pronounced vibrations corresponding to

irregularly delivered originating impulses, and finally a series of concluding

vibrations which rise and fall in value every three or four minutes. That

which appears on a seismogram as a two-blow earthquake terminates

with dual reinforcements. As illustrative of this I may refer to the Isle

of Wight seismogram of the South Indian Ocean earthquake of August .31,

--turbances the first I regard as the shock, and the second as its echo.

They are followed by pairs and groups of echoes. If we closely examine

the group of movements which I call the shock, and compare the same

with its echo (the second pair being too small to exhibit details), we find

that the sub-divisions of each roughly agree in character ; each shows five

phases (three of which are very distinct) of the same relative magnitudes.

After this we get another five-phase group, followed by two groups each

of four phases, beyond which point rhythmical recurrence is lost.

   A very good illustration of what maybe multiple echoes is found in the

Isle of Wight seismogram for June 29, 1898 (see Earthquake No. 215).
This is a very large earthquake which probably caused the whole of the
earth to pulsate, and the duration of its preliminary tremors indicates that
it originated at a very great distance. It had a duration exceeding three
hours. The main disturbance shows more than fourteen maxima of motion
which have a fairly symmetrical arrangement to the right and left of a
central dividing line. In the accompanying figure (Fig. 3), which is an

enlargement (1-7 times) of the central portion of the original seismogram,

the line of symmetry is marked SS. To the left of this is the main shock 1,
and on the right is its echo, 1', a repetition common to many earthquakes.
That violent shocks are, a few minutes later, sometimes followed by a
second severe movement, is well recognised in certain earthquake coun-
tries. In Japan they are called the Uri Kaishi, or return shaking, and

conditions leading to their production are readily imagined. All that can
be said about 2, 3, 4, and 5 is that they have approximately the same

characters as 2', 3', 4', and 5', but inasmuch aV the first series have
       ox SEISxMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.                    229

travelled more quickly than 1, whilst the latter have travelled more

slowly than 1', it is difficult to recognise the latter as echoes of the former.

Beyond 5' the vibrations suddenly become small, but they apparently

show such a marked repetition in form and uniformity in their time of

recurrence that these characteristics can hardly be the result of accident.

To facilitate comparison these have been enlarged, and are here reproduced,

the later group being placed beneath those which arrived earlier. (Fig. 4.)

The triangularly-headed echo 2' is not unlike 2 ; its spherically formed

successor 3 is repeated in  3'          and  so  we may continue through the series
                                     ;

until we reach the gourd formed 9 and 10 reflected in corresponding shape

by 9' and 10'.
     The time intervals between these corresponding groups are from twenty-

                                        FiG. 3.

Weeight to thirty-one minutes.               here appear to be dealing with a

series of vibrational groups each of which took almost exactly half an

hour to travel to and fro between two reflecting surfaces or districts. If

the waves were compressional in character the distance between these

surfaces would be about 8,000 kms., but if they travelled with the velocity

                                        --Zl Minutes'·  >

/' 2'  3' 10'

of the waves of shock this distance would be reduced to something under

3,000 kms. From their period and amplitude it is probable that the

distance lies between these values.
     The main point at issue, and the one to be answered before we enter

into further speculations, is whether seismograms showing this musical-like
repetition can be interpreted in the manner here suggested. The con-
cluding vibrations of an earthquake have usually been regarded as a

disorderly mob of pulsatory movements resulting from spasmodic impulses

which gradually gi-ew feebler as the activity at a seismic centre became
exhausted. The question before us is whether an eartliquake dies by a
process analogous to repeated and irregulr.r settlements of disjointed
materials, or whether it is simply a blow or blows which come to an end
                          --

with musical reverberations inside the world. For the present my opinion

inclines to the latter, and I see in the earthquake followers the likeness

of their parents.

        VI. Earthquake Precursors.

The series of movements to which I now refer is the procession of

vibrational groups which run before the main disturbance, with tlie

smaller of which, under the name of preliminary tremors, we are already

more or less familiar. These precursors have in several respects char-

acters which are exactly the opposite to those of the earthquake followers.

They have a definite commencement, and with large eai'thquakes group

after grcjup usually increases suddenly in amplitude and period.

     Another characteristic of the precursors is that whilst group after group

may grow larger, they become more and more irregular in their contoui's.

The first of the preliminary tremors, if they ever had any fretillernents

have lost the same, whilst those which follow carry serrations which are

marked. This observation, together with that of growth in amplitude,

suggests the idea that each group of precursors starting from a common

origin has reached an observing station by different routes : the first
have come along the path of least time, and the latter, culminating in the

shock, along paths continually approximating to that of free surface waves.

    Now and again we see in groups of preliminary tremors a likeness in

contour and arrangement of what is to follow. Near to an origin they

may have a duration of from 1 or 2 up to 10 or 20 seconds, and their

period has been recorded at from 1 to t/tt of a second. When they are

preceded by a sound wave, we have evidence of a very much higher

frequency. If these vibrations have travelled long distances and through

our earth, most records indicate a pei^iod of 3 or 4 seconds. Records from

Rome have shown periods of less than half a second, but even these are

Myprobably much too large.    own records only indicate a slight switch-

ing at the end of a light elastic boom, or that the same has been moved

very rapidly to and fro relatively to its steady point. Until a steady

point seismograph with extremely light multiplying indices or some other

special form of apparatus has been employed as a recorder, our knowledge

of this end of the seismic spectrum is not likely to increase.

The last points connected with the earthquake precursors are the

intervals of time which elapse between the arrival of the first tremor and

the largest wave or wa v^es corresponding to the originating impulse and

the duration of the first series of preliminary tremors. As measured on

seismograms for disturbances which have originated at different distances

from the Isle of Wight Observing Station, these two intervals are given

in the following table :

Origin
ox SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  231

     These figures are too few in number to be used as a foundation for any
certain conclusions, but they may possibly indicate results to be sought for
in future records. With regard to the first set of intervals, we know that
for distances up to 8" from an origin that the time by which tremors out-
race the main movement may be reckoned by seconds. Adding this fact
to our list, it seems that here we have a table which indicates that as
eartlujuakes travel at first the tremors only outrace the large waves at a
very slow rate, but as the distance from the origin increases this rate
increases. This goes on until a point between 48' and 62^ distant from
the origin has been reached, after which the rate at which the large move-
ments are left behind decreases.

      One explanation for this is to suppose that the first precursors came
thi'ough the earth with an average velocity which observation shows to

increase approximately with the square root of the.average depth of the
chord joining the centrum and the observing station, whilst the large

 waves travelled round the surface. One objection to this view is that
observations exist which show the lai'ge waves have apparently travelled
over paths varying between 20° and 110° at rates which, rather than being

 constant, have increased from 2-1 to 3-3 kms. per second.
      The velocities giving this comparatively slight difference were however

·determined on the assumption tl:at the times at which various earthquakes

originated were known, and there is therefore a possibility that they may

 be apparent rather than real.
      Also it must be remarked, as pointed out by Dr. C. G. Knott, that if

we regard the large waves as being distortional, inasmuch as the coefficient
of elasticity determining the velocity of propagation of such waves may

 not be greatly influenced by jsressure, it is quite conceivable that they
should follow the preliminary tremors through our earth. The question
then arises, whether these larger movements would be left farther and
farther behind their precursors in the manner indicated.

     When we come to our second set of intervals, which indicate the

duration of the first preliminary tremors before they are eclipsed by groups

 of vibrations, which usually grow in size, and appear from their periods
 to be distortional, we .see that up to a point about 62° from an origin
 these figures apparently increase, but beyond that point they grow less.

     What we have to explain, in addition to this fact, is that of the

 continuity and growth in magnitude of what very often forms a long and
 continuous series of preliminary motions. As I have already stated,

 their very appearance indicates that they have travelled on difTerent

 ipaths. The first have followed a path entirely through our earth, whilst

 its successors have travelled shorter and .shorter distances through the

 earth to meet a crust, through which they have completed their journey

 to the observing station. The first followed Knott's brachistrochronic

 path, or that of least time, whilst the successors took paths the latter

 parts of which were along arcs of increasing length. The result of this
 would be that at an observing station vibrations would arrive in series,
 each group corresponding to an originating impulse. The last of the
 rabble would be the series representing that portion of the main shock
 which had travelled entirely round and through the crust.

      To complete this hypothesis, I here reproduce a sketch given to me

 by Dr. C. G. Knott, showing the probable form of wave fronts and paths

 of compressional vibrations passing through our earth.

       The assumption on which this is based is that the square of the speed
--232 REPORT 1899.

<jf the movements is a linear function of the average depth, which'corre-
sponds, as already indicated, with observation.^

     The result at which Knott arrives indicates that the square of the

speed increases at 0-9 per cent, per mile of descent in the earth, the-
formula being

                     +y^=2"9 "026c? in mile second units.

    With an initial velocity of 1-7 mile per second the velocities at depths

of 400, 800, 1,200, _. . . . 4,000 miles, are 3-7, 4-9, 5-8, 6-7, 7-4, 8-1, 8-7,

9-3, 9-8 and 10-3 miles per second. The times taken for wave fronts to

reach tlie positions shown are indicated in the diagram, the time taken,

to jjass through the earth being twenty -two minutes.

I assume that when a wave has passed from its origin beyond the

region vaguely referred to as the crust of our earth, it then spreads in all

directions through a mass in which there is only an extremely gradual

change in elasticity and density with regard to its centre. All wave

paths, however, before they emerge at the surface, encounter at varying

obliquities the under surface of this crust. For purposes of illustration

we will assume this region of abrupt change to lie on the 400-mile circle.

The path P, meets this nearly at right angles, whilst P^ P^ meet the same

at decreasing angles less than right angles. After each of these incidences

a condensational wave will be refracted and split up into condensational

Nowand distortional rays.  it will be observed that these two waves,

which I will call c and d, will have diflei-ent distances to travel before

^ See £nt, Assoc. Bcjjort, 1898, p. 221.
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.                   233

Directly d^ emerges, not only will c, be eclipsed, but also t'2 c^, coming

At some point like P3, when the duration of the preliminary tremors

reaches a maximum on towards the origin, the quantity will decrease, if only

on account of the fact that the velocity along the brachistrochronic ray

differs less and less from that of the distortional wave within the crust.
Such a view may possibly explain the rise and fall in the values of our

last column.

    The growth in amplitude of the groups of tremors may be due to the-

fact that the first group has travelled on the path OF^, whilst the second

has travelled OP.2 Pj, &c., whilst the crests of these groups, especially of

those immediately in advance of the large waves, should roughly agree-

with the impulses which these represent.

VII. On Certain Disturbances in the Records of 2{agnetometers and the
                  Occurrence of Earthquakes. By John Milne.

      In the 'British Association Reports for 1898,' pp. 226-251, a large-
number of records were brought together, showing what has happened at
or about the time of large earthquakes to magnetic needles at various

Observatories. These records may be classified as follows :

      1. Those which show that magnetographs have very frequently been
disturbed at the time when their foundations have been moved by the-
large but unfelt waves of earthquakes originating at a great distance.
Examples of such movements are to be found in the registers from
Utrecht, Potsdam, and Wilhelmshaven. For the particular kind of earth
movement referred to, magnetic instruments at these places furnish

records of value to the seismologist.

      2. Those which show that magnetographs are seldom, and then only
very slightly, or in some instances apparently never disturbed at the time-
of large earthquakes. This appears to be the case at Greenwich, Kew,,
Falmouth, Stonyhurst, Pola, Vienna, Copenhagen, and Toronto.

      3. Those which show that magnetic needles have exhibited perturba-
tions, frequently of considerable magnitude, a short time before the occur-

rence of large earthquakes. As illustrative of such observations, reference
may be made to the registers from Zikawei, Mauritius, Utrecht, and
Gi'eenwich. Similar observations have been made in Japan. ^

     On pp. 248-251 of the above-mentioned report, an attempt is made to-

explain these observations, whilst to extend the same I append the
following table received from P. Barrachi, Director of the Melbourne

Observatory.

             Declinometer Disturbances observed at the Observatory, Melbourne.
                                       P. Baeeachi, Esq., Director.

     The magnetographs at Melbourne are of the same form and dimensions
as those at Kew. The value of an ordinate of 1 inch in the curves is very
nearly 29', and the time scale corresponds to 14-7 inches for twenty-

four hours.

   --In dealing with the curves for Observatory purposes as, for instance,
--taking mean values, ifcc. oscillations whose amplitudes are less than 2'

are not considered disturbances, but much smaller oscillations than these

can easily be detected in the curves. In order to avoid any arbitration
as to what disturbance should be singled out for the purpose of comparing
with the list of earthquakes, in cases where the curves appeared to be
generally disturbed, or where more than cne disturbance occurred, or
where several disturbances presented different characteristics, Mr. Barrachi

has put down in the following notes all the distinctive features of the
curves occurring within several hours, in some cases 10 or 12 hours, before
and after the times specified in the earthquake register, noting also every
appreciable oscillation, however small, so that those who make com-
parisons may discriminate for themselves. All times in the list are
indicated as Melbourne Mean Astronomical Time, the day commencing
at Melbourne noon, the hours being reckoned from to 24. By
amplitude is meant the whole range of displacement. Period means

the time taken for the double swing. When there is a movement from

the neutral line upwards and back to the same, followed some time later
by a movement downwards and back to the same, the latter is said to be

in the ' opposite phase ' to the former. As these two movements may be

independent of each other it will be recognised that the term ' opposite
phase ' is one of convenience. ' Superimposed waves ' means that there
are small waves which appear as regular or irregular, large or small,

serrations on the trace of larger waves.
     The earthquake list referred to by the numbers, dates, and times in the

first three columns is given in the ' British Association Report ' for 1898,

p. 227.

been possible with such systematic observations, but some particularly
good examples of rare types of cloud have been photographed, and some
valuable studies of lightning have been secured. So far as those latter
have been examined they fully confirm the conclusions of this Committee

as expressed in the reports for 1891, 1892, and 1893, which maybe briefly

summarised thus :

     1. The reality of the narrow ribbon structure.
     2. The existence of visible multiple discharges.
     3. The compound nature of many discharges.
     4. The long duration of many discharges.

     During a storm which passed over Exeter on July 22, about sunset^

a phenomenon was many times observed which seems to deserve further

study.

     This was a narrow ribbon flash of somewhat long duration (I'O to
2 "5 seconds) which broke up into a long train of sparks like the trail of a
rocket. These sparks faded away gradually, some of them lasting for a

second or two.

     The phenomenon does not seem to have been recorded photographically,
but is doubtless the explanation of the beads of extra bright light shown
on some photographs of lightning.

     It is worthy of note that the beaded discharges referred to accom-

panied exceptionally heavy rain. This suggests that the explanation may

be the dissociation of water and recombination of the liberated gases.

    The appreciable duration of the combustion may be due to the greater

diffusibility of the hydrogen carrying some of it beyond the oxygen and
thereby slackening the velocity of combination. Each dissociated drop
would give a ball of mixed gases in proportions exact at the centre, but
departing more and more from exactness towards the margin, where the
time of combustion would be correspondingly prolonged.

     The relation between the thunder-cloud and lightning has been very
clearly visible on several occasions. The cloud has always a peculiar

structure, which may be described as a lower cumulus disc uprising as a

thick column in the middle, which spreads out again at perhaps twice as
great an altitude in a more or less cirriform disc. In such a stoi-m, which
is typical, the majority of the discharges pass between the margins of the
upper and lower discs, or from one side to the other of either disc. Such-

flashes seem to be generally of a comparatively simple type. They may

branch or twist about or resemble the ordinary discharge of an induction
coil or Wimshurst machine.

     These flashes are often accompanied by, or immediately fulloived by
more brilliant discharges between the lower disc and the earth. This is
the 'impulsive rush 'of Dr. Lodge, and it is in such dit-charges that the
phenomena of multiple and beaded structures are presented. They are
analogous to the discharges between the knobs of two oppositely charged
Leyden jars whose outer coatings are imperfectly connected.

    No grant is asked for ; but the work of the Committee cannot be

regarded as complete until a much larger number of measurements of

altitude have been made, and they therefore ask for reappointment.

The Committee have been engaged dui'ing the year on the consideration
of the details of the new ampere balance, for which a grant of oOOl. was

voted at Bristol.

Professors Ayrton and Viriamu Jones have completed the plans and

specifications, and the construction of the balance has been authorised.

    An important addition to the plan proposed at Bristol consists of an

arrangement for adjusting accurately the position of the fixed coils. Sir

Andrew Noble has generously undertaken to have this constructed at

Elswick free of cost, and the Committee desire to thank him for the offer,

which they have gladly accepted.

     In consequence of the fact that the balance is not yet completed, the

grant of 300^. made last year has not been expended, and the Committee

apply for its renewal.

    An appendix to the Report contains a proof by Lord Rayleigh of a

theorem due to Professor J. V. Jones, on which the mathematical theory

of the new balance is based.

Details of the balance are reserved until it has actually been con-

structed.

Professor Callendar has brought before the Committee proposals for

the adoption of a standard scale of temperature based on the Platinum

Resistance Thermometer. These are printed in an appendix and formed

Athe basis of a discussion in the Section.    sub-Committee has been

formed to consider these proposals and to report to the Committee.

The ordinary testing of standards has been interrupted by the removal

of the Secretary to Liverpool, and still further by his proposed removal

to Kew. With respect to this the Committee have passed the following

resolution :

That Mr. R. T. Glazebrook, as Secretary of the Committee, be

?iuthorised aiid requested to retain the custody of the Electrical Standards

of the Association, and to remove them from Liverpool to London when
he takes up his post as Director of the National Physical Laboratory.

      Tlie removal of the Standards and the investigations of a Platinum
Thermometry will necessitate some expenditure during the year.

     The Committee therefore recommend that they be reappointed, with
the addition of Sir William Roberts- Austen and Mr. Matthey, and with a
^rant of 251. in addition to the unexpended balance (300^.) of last year's
grant, and that Lord Rayleigh be Chairman and Mr. R. T. Glazebrook

.Secretary.

                              APPENDIX I.

       The Mutual Induction of Coaxial Helices. Bij Lord Rayleigh.

     Professor J. V. Jones' has shown that the coefficient of mutual induction (M)
Tietween a circle aud a coaxial helix is the same as between the circle and a
uniform circular cylindrical current-sheet of the same radial and axial dimensions
as the belix, if the currents per unit length in helix and sheet be the same. This
conclusion is arrived at by comparison of the integrals resulting from an applica-

tion of Neumann's formula; and it maybe of interest to show that it may be

deduced directly from the general theory of lines of force.

     In the first place, it may be well to remark that the circuit of the helix must
be supposed to be completed, and that the result will depend upon the manner in

which the completion is arranged. In the general case the return to the starting-
point might be by a second helix lying upon the same cylinder ; but for practical
purposes it will sulilce to treat of helices including an integral number of revohi-
tions, 80 that the initial and final points lie upon the same generating line. The
return will then naturally be efiected along this straight line.

     Let us now suppose that the helix, consisting of one revolution or of any
number of complete revolutions, is situated in a held of magnetic force sym-
metrical with re.spect to the axis of the helix. In considering the number of

lines of force included in the complete circuit, it is convenient to follow in imagi-

nation a radius-vector drawn perpendicularly to the axis from any point of the
circuit. The number of lines cut by this radius, as the complete circuit is
described, is the number required, and it is at once evident that the part of the

circuit corresponding to the straight return contributes nothing to the total.-

As regards any part of the helix corresponding to a rotation of the radius through
an angle dd, it is equally evident that in the limit the number of lines cut through

is the same as in describing an equal angle of the circular section of the cylinder
at the place in question, whence Professor Jones's result ibllows immediately.
 Every circular section is sampled, as it were, by the helix, and contributes
proportionally to the result, since at every point the advance of the vector
parallel to the axis is in strict proportion to the rotation. It is remarkable that
the case of the helix (with straight return) is simpler than thst of a system of
true circles in parallel planes at intervals equal to the pitch of the helix.

      The replacement of the heli.x by a uniform current-sheet shows that the force

pymmetr}- alDout tlie axis is only approximately satisfied. Tlie question wbether

toth helices may be replaced by the correspondintr current-sbeets is to be

answered in the negative, as may be seen from consideration of the case where

there are two helices of the same pitch on cylinders of nearly equal diameters.

In one relative position of the cylinders the paths are in close proximity through-

Mout, and the value of will be large, but this state of things may be greatly

altered by a relative rotation through two right angles.

But although in strictness the helices cannot be replaced by current-sheets,

the complication thence arising can be eliminated in experimental applications by

a relative rotation. For instance, if the helix to which the field is supposed to

be due be rotated, the mean field is strictly symmetrical, and accordingly the mean
M Ais the same as if the other helix were replaced by a current-sheet.
                                                                                                further

application of Professor Jones's theorem now proves that the first helix may also

be so replaced. Under such conditions as would arise in practice, the mean of

two positions distant 180°, or at any rate of four distant 00°, would suffice to

eliminate any difference between the helices and the corresponding current-sheets,

if indeed such difference were sensible at all.

The same process of averaging suffices to justify the neglect of spirality when

the observation relates to the mutual attraction of two helices as employed in

current determinations.

Proposals for a Standard Scale of Temperature based on the Platinum
     Resistance Tliermometer. To he submitted to the Electrical Standards

    Committee. Drawn up by Professor H. L. Callendar, M.A., F.H.S,

     The following proposals are submitted in consideration of the importance of
adopting a practical thermometric standard for the accurate verification and
comparison of scientific measurements of temperature. The gas thermometer,

Avhich has long been adopted as the theoretical standard, has given results so

discordant in the hands of different observers at high temperatures, as greatly to

retard the progress of research.

     The arguments in favour of the adoption of the platinum resistance thermo-
meter as a practical standard were given by Professor H. L. Callendar, in a paper

' On the Practical Measurement of Temperature,' communicated to the Pioyal

Society in June 1888, and published in the ' Phil. Trans.' in the following year.
These arguments have since been confirmed and strengthened by the work of

many independent observers.
     The Electrical Standards Committee of the British Association has done so

much in the past with reference to the adoption of the present electrical standards,
and more recently in connection with the adoption of the joule as the absolute
unit of heat, that it would appear to be the most appropriate authoritj' for the

discussion and approval in the first instance of proposals relating to an electrical
standard of thermometry.

    The suggestions for the standard scale of temperature here proposed may be

embodied in the following resolutions :

(1) That a particular sample of platinum wire be selected, and platinum

resistance thermometers constructed to serve as standards of the platinum scale of

temperature.
-- A(Note.
              degree centigrade of temperature on the scale of a platinum resist-

ance thermometer corresponds to an increase of resistance equal to the hundredth

part of the change of resistance between 0° and 100° C. In other words tempera-

ture ^)f on the platinum scale is defined by the formula

                         jpt =^100 (R-R°) (R'--R°),
                                                                                             /

the teaiperatiives pt, 0°, and 100° C, respectively. The meltiug-poiut of ice is takeu
as the zero of tiiis scale in accordance with common usage.)

     (2) That the scale of temperature t deduced from the standard platinum scale
by means of the parabolic difference formula,

                                    t-pt = d{t\100-\)t I 100,

which has been proved to give a very close approximation to the true or thermo-
dynamic scale, be recommended for adoption as a practical standard of reference,

--and be called the British Association Scale of Temperature.
      (Note. The gas thermometer would still remain the ultimate or theoretical
standard, and the exact relation of the British Association scale to the absolute
scale would be the subject of future investigation. In the present state ol
experimental science, the' difference between the two scales over the greater part
of the range is less than the probable errors of measurement with the gas
thermometer, and the possible accuracy of measurement with a platinum thermo-
meter, especially at high temperatures, is of a much higher order than with the
gas thermometer. Measurements directly referred to the British Association scale
would therefore be of greater permanent value, because they could be subsequently
corrected when the relation between the scales had been more accurately

 determined.)

      (3) That the value of the difference-coefficient d in the parabolic difference-
formula be determined for the British Association standard thermometers by
reference to the boiling-point of sulphur as a secondary fixed point in the manner
described by Callendar and Griffiths, ' Phil. Trans. A, 1891.'

      {Note.--It is probable that this method gives the best results over the whole

range at temperatures above --100° C. At very low temperatures there appear to

 be singularities in the resistance variation of metals which require further investiga-
 tion. The boiling-point of liquid oxygen would be a more convenient secondary
 ii.xed point to choose for low temperature research, especially for testing thermo-
 meters the construction of which did not permit their exposure to a temperature

 as high as that of boiling sulphur.)

      (4) That the temperature of the normal boiling-point of sulphur under a

pressure of 760 mm. of mercury reduced to 0° C, and latitude 45°, be taken for the
purposes of the British Association scale as 44453° C, as determined by Callendar

 and Griffiths (loe. cif.), with a constant pressure air-thermometer.

   --(Note. Until the relation between the various gas-thermometer scales, and

 the expansion of glass and porcelain, have been more accurately determined, it
 does not appear that anything would be gained by changing this value to which
 so much accurate work has already been referred.)

A Comparison of Platinum and Gas Thermometers made at the Interna-
    tional Bureav, of Weights and Measures at Stvrcs. By Dr. P.

     Chappuis and Dr. J. A. Harker.

     Professor Callendar in 1886 investigated the method of measuring temperature
based on the determination of the electrical resistance of a platinum wire.

    He pointed out that if Pt^ denote the resistance of the spiral of a particular
platinum thermometer at 0°, and It, its resistance at 100°, we may establish for
the particular wire a scale, which we may call the scale of platinum temperature,-,

Esuch that if be the resistance at any "temperature T°, this temperature on the

^platinum scale will be  ^° x 100 degrees. For this quantity Callendar em-

ploys the symbol pt.

214 REroRT-- 1890.

     In order to reduce to tlie standard scale of temperature tlie indications of any
platinum thermometer, it is necessary to know the law connecting pt and T.
These are identical at 0° and 100°, but the determination of the relationship
between them at other temperatures is a matter for experiment.

     The work of (Jallendar established for a particular sample of platinum the

over the range G° to 600°, T Ijeing measured on the constant pressure air-scale,

and S being a constant.
      Later experiments by Cailendar and Griffiths showed that this relation holds

for platinum wires generalh', provided that they are not very impure. They
propose that the value of S, the constant employed in the formula, should be
determined by taking the resistance of the thermometer in the vapour of sulphur,
and a new determination hy them of the boiling-point of this substance, under

normal pressure, gave 444°'Ou on the air scale.
     The present communication gives a short account of some experiments which

are the outcome of the collaboration of the Kew Observatory Committee and the

authorities of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures at Sevres, for the
purpose of carrying out a comparison of some platinum thermometers with the
recognised International Thermometric Standards. A. full account of the
work will shortly appear in the ' Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society ' and in the ' Travaux et Mdmoires du Bureau International des Poids et

Mesures.'

   A new specially designed resistance-box, together with several platinum

thermometers, and the other accessories needed, were constructed for the Kew
Committee, and after their working had been tested at the Kew Observatory,

they were set up at the Sevres Laboratory in August 1897. The resistance-box
in its general desiga was very similar to the one previously described before this
Section by Mr. CTriffiths, but the plugs were replaced by a special form of contact
maker, and the coils were of manganine instead of platinum-silver. The methods
adopted for the standardisation of the apparatus only difiered in a few details

from those of Cailendar and Griffiths.
     The comparisons made between the platinum thermometers and the standards

of the Bureau may be divided into several groups. The first group of experi-
ments covers the range (-- 23° to 80°), and consists of a large number of com-

parisons between each platinum thermometer and the primary mercury standards
of the Bureau, whose relation to the normal hydrogen scale had previously been

studied by one of us.
     Above 80° the mercury thermometers were replaced by a gas thermometer,,

constructed for measurements up to high temperatures.

    We at first attempted to use hydrogen as the gas for these measurements, but,

owing probably to a slow chemical action taking place between the gas and the

glass reservoir in which it was enclosed, we were afterwards compelled to sub-
stitute nitrogen, which we have not observed to exert any action on the material

of the envelope up to a full red heat.
     The comparisons between 80° and 200° were made in a vertical bath of stirred

oil, heated by diflerent liquids boiling under varying pressures. For work above
200° a bath of mixed nitrates of potash and soda was substituted for the oil tank.
In this bath comparisons of the two principal platinum thermometers with the
gas thermometer were made up to 460°, and with a third thermometer, which was
provided with a porcelain tube, we were able to go up to 590°, the glass reservoir
of the gas thermometer being replaced by one of porcelain, whose dilatation had
previously been measured by the Fizeau method. Comparisons of the platinum
and gas scales were carried out at over 150 different points, each comparison
consisting of either ten or twenty readings of the different instruments.

     Bj' the intermediary of the platinum thermometers a determination of the

boiling-point of sulpliur on the nitrogen scale was also made. Three independent

sets of determinations of this point gave the following results

                                                                   o

     The mean of these, 445°-27, representing the temperature on the scale of tlm
constant volume nitrogen thermometer, differs only 0°-7 from that found by
Callendar and Griffiths for the same temperature expressed on the constant

pressure air-scale.

    If, for the reduction of the platinum temperatures in our comparisons, we adopt
the parabolic formula, and the value of 8 obtained by assuming our new number
for the sulphur point, we find that below 100° the differences between the

observed values on the nitrogen scale and those deduced from the platinum ther-
motuetev are very small, seldom exceeding 0°-01, and that even at the highest

temperatures the difference only amounts to a few tenths of a degree.

On the Uxpansion of Porcelain tvith Rise of Temperahire.
            By T. G. Bedford, B.A. Cambridge.

In direct comparisons of the scales of temperature given by air and by platinum-

resistance thermometers at high temperatures, the expansion of the porcelain

envelope enters as a small correction.

     In the experiments described in this paper, a direct determination of the linear

Cexpansion of porcelain was made at temperatures from 0° to 830° 0. The

method used was essentially the same as that described by Callendar (' Phil. Trans.'

1887, A. p. 167).

    On a tube of Bayeux porcelain two fine transverse marks were made at a

distance about 91-3 cm. apart. The tube was heated to as high a temperature as

possible in a gas furnace, and was then slowly cooled by diminishing the gas

supply. During cooling the variation in the distance between the marks was

determined by a pair of reading microscopes which were mounted on stone blocks

and not touched except by the screw-head during an experiment. The readings of

the microscopes for a standard length (a glass tube kept in melting ice) were taken

at intervals.

The temperatures corresponding to the length measurements were deduced

from the resistance of a platinum wire running from mark to mark in the axis of

the tube and supported on a plate of mica. The resistances in ice and steam were

taken after each exposure to a high temperature. The sample of platinum wire

from which the piece used in these experiments was cut is known to have a value
of S, in Oalleudar's formula, from I'oO to ISl. The value 8 = I'oO.j was used, and

thus a direct determination of the resistance at the temperature of boiling sulphur

Anwas avoided.     error of -Ol in S causes an error of less than 1° in the calculated

value oU at 1,000° C.

     Four main experiments were made ; the results were plotted and are reproduced
on the accompanying slide.

From 0° 0. to GOC° C. the results are represented fairly well by the formula

                                   /, = /,,(! + 34-25 X lQ-''t + 10-7 .< 10-'"^-).

Above 600° C. the points are more erratic, but still do not depart far on either

side from the curve given by the above formula.

   A length of about G cm. at either end of the tube -was not directly heated by

the furnace. Hence there is an uncertainty due to the ends (greater at the higher
temperatures), since the coefficient of expansion varies with the temperature.

     For cubical expansion the above formula gives

                   i\ = v (1 + 102-7o X 10-'^ + 32-4 X 10 -'"^2).

     G. F. Fit/.Gekald, Dr. J. H. Gladstone, Professor 0. J. Lodge,
     and Dr. Alexander Galt (Secretary).

AAt last year's meeting at "Bristol Dr. Gait submitted to Section an

account ' of some experiments which he had made on the heat of com-
bination of zinc and copper. The Association then granted 20/. for the
continuance of the experiments. The work was accordingly continued by
Dr. Gait, and the Committee have received from him tlie following
account of his experiments made since the Bristol Meeting :

     Altogether twenty-two different alloys of zinc and copper, whose com-
position varied from 5 to 90 per cent, of copper, were made for this
investigation from practically pure metals, and their analyses determined
by Messrs. Johnson, Matthey, and Co., London. The first set of five, num-
bered A, B, C, D, E, was sent on March 16, 1898 ; the second set, of
seven, numbered 1-7, on December 1, 1898, and the third and final set
of ten, numbei'ed L-Y, on March 8, 1899. With these alloys and witli

the corresponding mixtures of the metals, all in fine filings, the experi-

ments were carried out. The procedure adopted was exactly similar to
that described in detail in last year's paper, and each experiment was
repeated from three to six times, until consistent results for the heat of
solution in each case were obtained, and the mean of these was taken.
The heat of solution of zinc alone and of copper alone was also ascertained
in a similar manner. The total weight of the whole apparatus (excluding
acid and metallic filings) was 42 grammes, and its water equivalent
was found to be 5-7 grammes. The specific heat of the nitric acid used,
density 1'360 at 15° C, was determined, and the mean of several values
was 658.

   A tabular statement of results is appended. The absolute amount of

heat evolved in dissolving 1 gramme of metal is calculated from the

following formula :

                            +ll=t{(i:r/.s.) c], where

      =t increase of temperature in Centigrade degrees of the acid used

       =v volume of the acid in cubic centimetres,
      =g density of the acid,
       =s specific heat of the acid,
       =·c water equivalent of the apparatus.

     The specific heat of the metal used is negligible, and is not taken into

account.

     The heat units evolved by the solution of 1 gramme of each alloy
and of the corresponding mixture are shown on fig. 1, values for mix-
tures being denoted by a small circle, those for alloys by a small cross.

     The difference between the absolute heat of solution of 1 gramme of

each mixtui'e and its corresponding alloy indicates the heat of com-

bination of the metals in forming 1 gramme of alloy. These differences
are shown on fig. 2, and they indicate that the heat of combination is
at first negative, which reaches a maximum when the alloy contains about
16 per cent, of copper. With greater percentages of copper the negative

value of the heat of combination i-apidly falls to zero and then becomes,

positive. The maximum positive value is very soon reached at about

.}8 per cent, copper, which is near the formula CuoZn;,. Beyond this
point the heat of combination gradually becomes less, until at 90 per cent-

copper it almost vanishes.

HEAT OF COMBINATION OF METALS IN FORMATION OF ALLOYS. 241*'

     Tlie experiments were made accortling to the method fully described
in a paper by Dr. Gait, on "Heat of Combination of Metals," com-
municated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, on March 7, 1898.'
In each case of solution the nitrous products remained in the liquid, the
vessel in which the solution took place being kept closed by a cork. The
importance of this arrangement is illustrated by the following statement

extracted from the paper just referred to :

     " If the method of pouring the acid on the filings or of dropping tho
filings into the acid had been adopted, a violent action would havt-.
occurred, and it would not have been possible to prevent the loss of heat
due to escape of fumes. But the plan adopted effectually got rid of this
<lifficulty by the almost instantaneous projection of the bulb containing tlit;
filings to the bottom of the acid.'-' It was very interesting to watch the
scouring effect in the bulb due to the chemical action ; the filings were almost
instantaneously expelled from it by the rapid evolution of gas, the removal
being facilitated by the existence of the two apertures already described.
The gentle rotatory motion given to the acid was kept up while solution
was going on, and when it was complete the thermometer reading was
again noted. Tiie time required to effect solution was 50 to 55 seconds,

and it was observed that complete solution and maximum temperature

were reached about the same time."

Addition hy the Chairman.

The Committee has carefully considei'ed an objection to the method of'

experiment which was suggested after the reading of the Report at the

Dover meeting, to the effect that nitrous products evolved from the

solution might be different in the cases of the solution of the mi.xture-

and the solution of the alloy. It seems not probable that even if gaseous-

products liad been allowed to escape, they would have been different in

these two cases ; but as the whole nitrogenous products remained in the

solution in each case, it seems scarcely possible that there can have been

any final chemical difference in the solutions. As, however, the question

has been suggested, a chemical investigation of the solutions in tlie two

cases might be interesting.                        K.

Addition h)j Dr. Gladstone.

This suggestion of the Chairman seems to me most important, and one

that ought to be carried out, as there is reason to believe that the chemical

products in the two solutions would be different.  J. H. G.

                    Addition by Professors FitzGeraJd and Lodge.

     The above report was drawn up by Dr. Gait, and though we consider
it most interesting, and have reason to believe that if the experiments
were repeated the results would not be very different, yet, as it has been
suggested that the chemical products resulting from actions on the mixed
metals and on the alloy might be different, we do not feel justified in con-

cluding that the heat of combination of the metals can be safely deduced

from these results in the simple way suggested. G. F. F.-G., O. J. L.

accompanies it. But the facility with which the gases miybe condensed by the

      BucHAN. (Brawn tip hij Dr. Buchan.)

The Committee was appointed as in past years for the purpose of co-

operating with the Scottish Meteorological Society in making meteorologi-
cal observations at the two Ben Nevis Observatories.

     The hourly eye observations, made by night as well as by day, which
are a speciality of the Ben Nevis Observatory, being as yet not attempted
at any other first-class meteorological observatory in the world, were
made with complete regularity by Mr. A.ngus Rankin and his assistants.

     The health of the staff at the high level Observatory continued good,
and the heavy work of the Observations has been carried on without the loss
of a single hour's observations. The Directors desire to express their very
cordial thanks to Messrs. J. S. Begg, M.A., P. S. Hardie, AV. A. Bartlett,

Andrew Hunter, and T. Kilgour, for the invaluable assistance they
rendered as volunteer observers, thus enabling them to give the members

of the staff the relief they greatly stood in need of. Special thanks are
due to Mr. Begg for the great service he rendered in taking at no small
personal risk the place of observer at Fort "William during the time of
the influenza there, which was of an exceptionally severe character.

     The observations at the intermediate station on Ben Nevis, ·2,200 feet,
were again undertaken by Mr. T. S. Muir, M.A., assisted by the late
Mr. Campbell Irons. These observations, together with those made in
1897, are being discussed by Mr. Muir, under the superintendence of
Mr. Omond. Arrangements were made for the resumption of these
valuable observations during the current holiday season. The observa-
tions will be made on the lines indicated in your Committee's Report of

last year.

     The principal results of the observations of 1898 are detailed in
Table I.

for the year was 25-992 inches on June 10 j and at Fort William:

The absolutely highest temperature for the year recorded for Fort-

William was 79°-7 on September 6, and at the top 62°'G on the same date.

The absolutely lowest temperature was 21°-1 on November 29 at Fort

AWilliam, and 9°-G on February 20 at the top of the mountain.                                          notice-

able feature of these maximum temperatures in September, when the type

of weather was strongly anticyclonic, was the lateness of the season when

they occurred, and, besides, they far exceed any previously recorded in

September at either of the Observatories.

In Table II. are given for each month the lowest observed hygrometric

readings at the top of Ben Nevis :

13°'3. It is to be noted tliat with these humidities the accompanying dew-

--point fell only once below zero, viz., to 6°5 on Deceml)er 8, being in this

respect very different from the low humidities of previous years.

     The registrations of tiie sunshine recorder at the top TGf) hours out of
a possible 4,470 hours, being 48 hours fewer than in 1897. This is

17 per cent, of the possible sunshine. The monthly maximum was
149 hours in May, and the minimum 11 hours in January and 12 hours
in December. At Fort William the number of hours was 1,241, being
the largest hitherto recorded. The maximum was 213 hours in May, and
the minimum 1 1 hours in December. The annual number of hours,

1,241, is 3G per cent, of the possible sunshine at Fort William.

     At the Ben Nevis Observatory the mean percentage of cloud was 85,
which is nearly the average, the highest being 9.3 in January and
February, and the minimum 7G in May, July, and October ; and at Fort
William, the mean was 73, the highest being 86 in January, and the

lowest 64 in September.

    The mean rainband observation (scale 0--8) was 2-3 at the top for the
year the maximum being 3'0 in July and the minimum 1-5 in March.

                           ;

At Fort William the mean for the year was 3-7, the maximum being 43
in April and the minimum 3-4 in February, March, and July.

     The mean hourly velocity of the wind was at the top of the mountain

14 miles per hour, the maximum velocity being 21 miles in October, and
the minimum G miles in July, being the lowest mean yet recorded on
Ben Nevis. The means of 10 miles for May, 8 miles for June, 6 miles for

July, and 10 miles for August, were the lowest means yet observed in

four consecutive months, thus forming a striking feature of the meteorology

of Ben Nevis during the summer months of 1898.
     The rainfall for the year was 240-05 inches, which is by far the largest

rainfall of any year yet observed on the top of Ben Nevis, being
59 per cent, above the average of the observations made since 1881. This
high percentage above the average was approximated to at several
stations in this part of the West Highlands. The largest monthly
amount was 43"65 inches in December, and, as will be seen from Table I.,
the amount for six of the months was exceptionally large. Another

singular circumstance is that the amounts for each of the months exceeded
their average. The heaviest fall on any single day was 5 '39 inches on

November 2. At Fort William the amount for the year was 106-51 inches,
the largest yet observed here, being 38 per cent, above the average. The
largest monthly amount was 24-01 inches in December. The heaviest fall
on any single day was 3-66 on December 4.

     On the top of Ben Nevis rain fell on 281 days, and at Fort William
on 265 days. At the top the maximum number of rainy days was 29 in
December and the minimum 17 in June ; the numbers for Fort William

being 30 days in December and 15 in June.
     During the year the number of days on which 1 inch of rain or more

was collected was 86 at the top and 26 at Fort William, these being ^ery
greatly above the averages, the percentages excess being 80 and 69
respectively. In December, at the top, more than 1 inch of rain fell on
eighteen days and in February on fifteen days. The prominent feature of
the meteorology of Ben Nevis in 1898 was the unprecedented number of

days characterised by heavy rainfalls, April and May being tlie only

exceptions.

     Auroras are reported to have been observed on the following dates :

Much time continues to be given to the discussion of the hourly

obsei'vatious of the two Observatories. The work of reducing and entering

these observations for every day, side by side, so as to present a direct and
easy comparison of the two, is far advanced, being brought down to the
end of 1897. The number of daily sheets finished is 2,710, and, as each

sheet contains twenty-two columns, the laboriousness of the work may be

in some degree appreciated.

As explained in previous Reports, the rainfall, fog, thunder, lightning,

halos, aurora, and other phenomena observed at 120 stations on each day,

are entered on a map of Scotland for that day. The whole of these maps

are now completed down to December 1898, the number of the maps

Aamounting to 2,922.    beginning has been made to enter on these maps

the gales and storms which have occurred at the seventy lighthouses round

the Scottish coasts. Care is taken to note the houi' of commencement of

each storm, so that a comparison may be made as to the commencement

and violence of storms and the related forecasts issued by the Meteoro-

logical Office in London.

    Storms which strike the Scottish coasts may be conveniently divided

into these chief classes, viz. : storms which overspread the whole of Scot-

land ;  storms over the west  coast only ;  storms over the  east coast only
                                                                                                                                   ;

and storms more restricted as to the area they overspread, such as only

from the Tweed to the Tay, from the Tay to the Moray Firth, over the
Hebrides, and those confined to Orkney and Shetland. As regards

the intensity of storms, since this depends on the barometric gradients

formed within the cyclones, these gradients will be specially examined in,

the relations they stand to the vertical gradients of pressure, temperature,

and humidity formed in the stratum of the atmosphere between the top

and foot of Ben Nevis.

The Ben Nevis observations indicate that the great majority of

cyclones show the winds both at the top and bottom of the mountain
blowing vorticosely inwards upon the central area of the cyclones. But

no inconsiderable number of cyclones passing over Ben Nevis show that

while the winds at sea level blow inwards upon the cyclone, the winds at

the top of the Ben blow outwards from the cyclones. Now the vertical

gradients of pressure, temperature, and humidity, as disclosed by the two

Observatories, open up very important lines of inquiry in the investi-

gation of these difierent types of cyclones.

Again, the frequent sudden changes of these vertical gradients suggest

lines of inquiry of no less importance as to the relation of these changes

to the manner of distribution over the stations of the rain accompanying
'

METEOROLOGICAL OBSEKVATIONS ON BEN NEVIS.  255

the cyclones and many of the smaller barometric depressions. In several

respects tliis remark applies also to the distribution of fogs.

    Among the results indicated by the observations made during the past

four summer seasons at the intermediate station comjDared with the
observations made at the two Observatories, the more important referred

to in our last year's Report is this : When the reduced barometer at the

top of Ben Nevis, for a series of observations, comes higher than that of
Fort William, the accompanying disturbance of temperature takes place

in the lower half of the mountain, that is below the intermediate station,

and denotes the ajyproach of an anti-cyclone. Conversely, when the
reduced barometer at the Ben Nevis Observatory reads lower than that

of Fort William, then the disturbance of temperature takes place in the

upper half of the mountain, and denotes the approach of a cyclone.
     The hourly and other observations at the two Observatories from

January 1888 to December 1896 are now in the press, together with a

general discussion of the results, and other discussions of separate inquiries

raised by observations, nearly all of which have been resumed in the suc-
cessive annual reports of your Committee.

     Arrangements have been made for the publication during the next

three years, in the 'Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,'
of the hourly observations made at the Observatories from 1888 to 1901,
the time to which it is proposed by the Directors to continue the obser-
vations. The observations will fill three large quarto volumes, the cost of

publishing which will be a little over 1,000*'. Your Committee have much
pleasure in adding that the Royal Society of London have agreed to give
SOO^., being half of the whole expenditure, the balance being met by the
Royal Society of Edinburgh ; and that Mr. Mackay Bernard of Dunsinnan
has by another donation of 500/. enabled the Directors to continue the
observations for another year. These handsome gifts, the first two by the

two leading Scientific Societies of the country, and the third by a generous
private person, are announced by your Committee with great satisfaction.

--Water and Sewage Examination Resxdts. Report of the Committee,

    consistinij of Professor W. Ramsay (Ghaironan), Dr. S. Rideal
    (Secretary), Sir W. Crookes, Professor P. Clowes, Professor

      P. F. Frankland, ajul Professor R. Boyce, appointed to establish
     a Uniform Sijstem of recordinr/ the Kesidts of the Chemical and
     Bacterial Examination of Water and Sewage.

  --The Committee beg to report as follows : That it is desirable that

results of analysis should be expressed in parts per 100,000, except in

the case of dissolved gases, when these should be stated as cubic centi-
metres of gas at 0°C. and 760 mm. in 1 litre of water. This method of
recording results is in accordance with that suggested by the Committee
appointed in 1887 to confer with the Committee of the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science, with a view to forming a uniform

system of recording the results of water analysis.

     2. The Committee suggest that in the case of all nitrogen compounds

                                                     > Brit. Assoc. Rej)ort, 1889.
       --

2oG REPORT-- 189P.

the results be expressed as parts of nitrogen over 100,000, including the

ammonia expelled on boiling with alkaline permanganate, which should
be termed albuminoid nitrogen. The nitrogen will, therefore, be re-

tui'iied as

     (1) Ammoniacal nitrogen from free and saline ammonia.
      (2) Nitrous nitrogen from nitrites.
      (3) Nitric nitrogen from nitrates.
     (i) Organic nitrogen (either by Kjeldahl or by combustion, but the

·process used should be stated).
     (.5) Albuminoid nitrogen.

     The total nitrogen of all kinds will be the sum of the first four deter-

minations.

     The Committee are of opinion that the percentage of nitrogen oxidised,
tliat is, the ratio of (2) and (3) to (1) and (4), gives sometimes a useful
measure of the stage of purification of a particular sample. The purifica-
tion efiected by a process will be measured by the amount of oxidised
nitrogen as compared with the total amount of nitrogen existing in the

'-rude sewage.

     In raw sewage and in effluents containing suspended matter it is also
desirable to determine how much of the organic nitrogen is present in the
suspended matter.

     In sampling, the Committee suggest that the bottles should be filled
jiearly completely with the liquid, only a small air-bubble being allowed
to remain in the neck of the bottle. The time at which a sample is
drawn, as well as the time at which its analysis is liegun, should be noted.

An effluent should be drawn to correspond as nearly as possible with the

original sewage, and both it and the sewage should be taken in quantities
pi'oportional to the rate of flow when that varies (e.g. in the emptying of
a lifter bed).

      In order to avoid the multiplication of analyses the attendant at

a sewage works (or any other person who draws the samples) might be

provided with sets of twelve or twenty-four stoppered [ Winchester
Itottles, one of which should be filled every hour or every two hours, and
on the label of each bottle the rate of flow at the time should be written.

When the bottles reach the laboratory quantities would be taken from each

proportional to these rates of flow and mixed together, by which means a
fair average sample for the twenty-four hours would be obtained.

     The Committee at present are unable to suggest a method of reporting
liacterial results, including incubator tests, which is likely to be accept-

able to all workers.

--Ahsorption Spectra and Chemical Constitution of Organic Siihstances.
       Interim Report of the Committee, consisting 0/ Professor W. Noel
     Hartley (Chairman and Secretary), Professor F. R. Japp, and
      Professor J. J. Dobbie, appointed to investigate the Relation
     hetiveen the Absorption Spectra ami Chemical Constitution of Organic
       Siihstances.

                                                       Introduction.

In presenting an interim report on the subject of the relation between the
Absorption Spectra and Chemical Constitution of Organic Substances, it
will be convenient to refer briefly to the report made to the British
Association which was drawn up l^y Professor Huntington and presented
at the Swansea Meeting in 1880.' It will there be noticed that the work
originated in the discoveries of Sir George Gabriel Stokes in 1852 and
1853, and of the late Dr. William Allen Miller in 1862. Next M. L.

Soret and MM. Soret and Rilliet advanced this line of research by

showing that by the increased molecular mass of the alkyl radical there
was increased absorption of the ultra-violet rays, though no absorption

bands were observed in nitrates and nitrites of these substances. W. N.

Hartley, in 1874, from a consideration that all the characteristic physical
properties of organic substances are dependent on their molecular consti-
tution, inferred that if a large number of substances of a similar con-
stitution were examined, such as the ethereal salts of the organic acids
and homologous series of the normal alcohols and acids, evidence would be
obtained of the influence of impurities and of the variations in the absorp-

tion of the invisible rays caused by each increment of CHo in the molecule.

The work was found impracticable without the aid of photography, and
a form of camera was therefore constructed which admitted of metallic
spectra being taken with all lines in focus on a flat plate from wave-
lengths 5,400 to 2,000. It was also found necessary to employ dry-plates,
and all the known makes were tried, some of which proved to be quite
unsuitable. For the first time in spectrum work gelatino-bromide plates
were used with success. The method of experimenting at the present
time, except for a few modifications, is that described in the ' Phil. Trans,,'
Part I., 1879., Hartley and Huntington.-

     After the examination of a large number of specially purified carbon
compounds the following generalisations were arrived at :

    1. The normal alcohols of the sexies C,,H2,, + iOH are remarkable for

transparency to the ultra-violet rays, pure methylic alcohol being nearly

as much so as water.
     2. The normal fatty acids exhibit a greater absorption of the more

refrangible rays than the normal alcohols containing the same number of

carbon atoms.
     3. There is an increased absorption of the more refrangible rays

corresponding to each increment of CHg in the molecule of the alcohols

and acids.
     4. Like the alcohols and acids the ethereal salts (esters) derived from

them are highly transparent to the ultra-violet rays, and do not exhibit

absorption bands.

    At a later date it was shown incidentally in the examination of other

substances that the various secondary alcohols, isopropylic, isobutylic, and
the differeiit amylic alcohols showed no absorption bands. The same

properties were shared by various polyhydric alcohols, such as glycol,

glycerine, mannite, cane sugar, and dextrose.
     In fact no open chain carbon compound causes selective absorp>tion.
     All substances derived from a closed chain of carbon atoms of the

benzene type were found to be strongly adiactinic. It had been shown
by Sir George Stokes that one of these substances, salicine, developed an
absorption band when the solution was diluted. This matter was followed

up by the examination of allied substances such as phenol, salicylic acid,
and other derivatives of benzene, to ascertain whether they also exhibit

absorption spectra characterised by bands.

     The facts elicited were the following :--

     5. Benzene and the hydrocarbons derived therefrom by the replace*
ment of hydrogen, phenols, aromatic acids and amines, are remarkable
first, for their powerful absorption of the most refrangible rays ; secondly,
for the absorption bands made visible by dissolving them in water or
alcohol ; and thirdly, for the extraordinary intensity of these absorption
bands even in very dilute solutions.

      6. Isomeric substances containing the benzene nucleus exhibit widely
different spectra, inasmuch as their absorption bands vary in position and

intensity.

     7. The photographic absorption spectra can be employed as a means of
identifying organic substances, and as a most delicate test of their purity.
The curves obtained by co-ordinating the extent of dilution, or in other
words the quantity of substance, with the position of the rays of the
spectrum transmitted by the solution, form a strongly marked and highly
characteristic feature of very many substances.

Observations were extended to the essential oils, because they are

known to consist for the most part of hydrocarbons which are physically

isomeric, and which differ therefore in constitution from benzenoid hydro-

carbons and their derivatives, though in a manner closely related to

Abenzene.  large number of specimens were thoroughly examined.^

According to the classification employed at that time there were three

groups, the second and third being polymers of the first, as shown by their

formulas,

           CioHie, Ci5H.,4, and CooHjo.

    No absorption bands were discovered in any of the following specified

substances or in the hydrocarbons derived from them by distillation ; but
the extent of the absorption of the ultra-violet rays was found to be
greater the larger the number of carbon atoms in the molecules ; such
increase in the number of carbon atoms being due to the side chains

or pinene (which was shown subsequently to be camphene chiefly),^

australene, terebenthene, hesperidene, cajeputene dihydrate ; the oils
of lign-aloe, Indian geranium, santal wood, cedrat, birch bark, juniper,
rosemary, rosewood, lavender, vitivert, turpentine, cubebs, patchouli,

citronella, elder, Melaleuca ericifolia, and cedar Avood oil ; the hydro-
carbons extracted from cedrat, nutmeg, caraway, otto of rose, and otto
of citron and menthol.

     The presence of cymene, a benzene derivative, in some small propor-
tion, in the hydrocarbons from thyme, lemon, and nutmeg, in the blue oil
from patchouli, and also in one specimen of the caraway hydrocarbon,
was proved by the absorption bands characteristic of that substance.

     It was not within the scope of the Report of 1880 to treat especially
of the relations between the absorption spectra and chemical constitution
of organic compounds, but the conclusions just quoted must necessarily
be taken into account, first in connection with the researches of "Wallach
and othei's on essential oils, and subsequently in the accounts of other
investigations of absorption spectra which have since been published.

                     Essential Oils and theie Constituents.

     That essential oils of the terpene class are related in a certain manner
to benzene was indicated in a general way by their powerful absorption,
though their spectra are free from bands. Chemical researches have since
thrown much light upon their constitution, and shown the nature of their

relations to benzene, the hydrocarbons being hydrogen-addition products
of cymene or some other benzenoid derivative.

    It is now known that cymene is p. methyl-isopropyl benzene. By

fractional distillation cymene had been separated from orange oil, French
turpentine, and Russian turpentine ; it was believed that these substances
were largely composed of cymene, that it was in fact one of their constitu-
ents. It was shown, however, by their spectra that no cymene was contained
in the first two and but 4 per cent, in the last. The inference was distinct
and clear that the cymene found was the product of the chemical treatment
to which these terpenes had been subjected while under investigation,
and in connection with the most recently made investigations of this nature
it is a point of some importance.

     But there were substances in essential oils characterised by very
powerful absorption bands, and it was concluded that they were composed
largely of true benzene -derivatives or benzenoid hydrocarbons. These
were the oils of bay, thyme, peppermint, bergamot, cloves, aniseed, cassia,
carvone, myristicol, and otto of pimento. It M^as, however, generally
admitted that eugenol with the constitution CgH3(O0H3)(C3H,)'OH
is contained in the oils of bay, pimento, and cloves ; that anethol,
CgH4(OCH3)(C-,Il5), is contained in aniseed, and that thymol,

C6H3(CH3)(C3H7)'-OH, is a constituent of oil of thyme (1:4:3
hydroxy-cymene) and may thus be represented :

                >>CH (CH3).,

The constitutions of the oils of bergamot and peppermint were unknown,

as likewise those of the substances menthol, carvone, and myristicol, but
the lattei' three were said to be isomeric'

     From the character of its spectrum it was shown that the nucleus of
menthol was a terpene, while carvone and myristicol were concluded to be

strictly benzenoid derivatives. Furthermore, a close examination of the
absorption spectrum of myristicol led to the conclusion that it was a
mixture of two substances, one only of which was capable of causing
selective absorption. It was concluded that carvone was really a benzenoid

derivative, oil of peppermint almost entirely so, while bergamot was
shown to be a mixture of a terpene with a benzenoid derivative. Shortly

these deductions were arrived at by considering that if a substance which
shows absorption bands is not a mixture, no repeated fractional distillation
will show any variations in the intensity of the absorption, or variations
in the position of the bands in sevei'al fractions.

     It was also pointed out that the refraction equivalents, as determined
by Dr. Gladstone, are abnormal in carvone and myristicol, like those of
substances derived from the aromatic nucleus.

     The conclusions which were drawn at the time as to the constitution
of those carbon groupings which can alone give rise to absorption bands
have been fully justihed, not only by purely chemical investigations, but
also by more recent research into the absorption spectra of closed chain
carbon compounds of diflferent characters.

     For instance, it was shown by Hartley - that camphor and benzene
hexachloride exhibited merely a continuous absorption and no absorption
band, furthermore that tetra-hydrobenzenes and tetra-hydropyridine or
their derivatives possessed the same character.^ Referring more par-

--ticularly to the substances in essential oils we have the following classifica-

tion :

8 or 10 only as parent substances in essential oils.* The terpenes appear

     Consequently, the formula for borneol should be written thus :

    So far as we know at present, there is nothing in the absorption

spectra of camphene and camphor which gives support to the one formula
rather than to the other.

     It will thus be seen that a marked distinction is to be dratvn between
the constitution of those substances in essential oils which are characterised
by a continuous absorption, and those lohich exhibit the peculiarity of
absorption bands; ivhile the former belong to tvhat has been termed the

hydro-aromatic yroitp, the latter are true derivatives of the aromatic series.

The original conclusions have thus been confirmed.
     Without entering into details of their structural formulaj in each case,

it may be stated that none of the hydroxy-derivatives, or other oxy-

derivatives, of the hydro-aromatic group exhibits absorption bands. Of

substances which were examined the following examples may be

of this will possibly be evident from a considei'ation of the theory which
accounts for the occurrence of absorption bands.

    Two most distinct advances were made at this period which connect

the molecular structure of organic substances with their absorption
spectra. The first is the work of Russell and Lapraik and the second

that of Abney and Testing. Both of these memoirs show what change is
caused in the spectra of substances when alkyl radicals and hydroxyl are
substituted for hydrogen. About this period the following work was also

published. J. L. Schonn ^ examined the absorption spectra of methyl,
ethyl, and amyl alcohol in layers from 1'6 to 3'7 metres in thickness, and
observed nari-ow absorption bands in their spectra. Kriiss, from Schonn's
measurements, calculated their wave-lengths. They lie in the red, orange,
and yellow.

Lapraik is the observations

every CH;, group introduced either into the C^H,; or the NH3 molecule

there is a shifting of the bands of absorption towards the red end of the

spectrum. This is quite definitely established. In the ultra-violet a
similar result was found by Hartley and Huntington for tri-ethylamine,

di-ethylamine and ethylamine : for each ethyl group introduced there was

a shortening of the spectrum. ·

On the Influence of the Atomic Grouping in the Molecules op

     Organic Bodies on their Absorption in the Infra-red Region

    OF THE Spectrum.-^ By Captain Abney, R.E., F.R.8., and Lieutenant-

     Colonel Festing, R.E.

     Abney and Festing have photographed rays extending down to

\ 12000 ; the visible region ends about /\ 7600. They studied the absorp-

tion spectra of water, hydrochloric acid, chloroform, carbon tetra-

chloride, cyanogen, and a number of hydrocarbons and their hydroxyl                                                                                                                                                                  '
haloid, and carboxyl derivatives.

     Those carbon compounds which contain hydrogen show a character-

istic group of lines, which, however, are absent from compounds contain-
ing no hydrogen. They do not all appear in some of the
compounds, and it is inferred that they belong to hydrogen.                                      hydroc°^en

     When oxygen is present as hydroxyl, it obliterates the' rays between
two of the lines, which are due to hydrogen. When it forms part of the
carbon nucleus of a compound, as it does in aldehyde, the spectrum is
inclined to be linear, or the bands are bounded by well-defined lines
These appear to be characteristic bands which indicate the carbon nucleus
of a series of substances.

     There are some radicals which exhibit a distinctive absorption spec-
trum, in some cases lying near \ 7000, in others about \ 9000

benzene, aniline, and ethylaniline, the following coincident bands are
probably due to the benzene nucleus ; a line at X 8670 is the principal one,
X 86/0 to 8/20, \S720 to 8880, and a fourth band about X 9300 a fifth
being about X 10400 to 10660.

The Measurement of the Ultra-Violet Spectra.

Up to this period 1883-84, the only wave-lengths of lines available

for reference in the region of the ultra-violet were those of the metal

cadmium, measured by M. Mascart, and these were found insufficient. To

obviate the difficulty in accurately describing spectra, the spark-spectra

of twenty-two elements had been photographed,^ and the absolute wave-

lengths of lines belonging to sixteen elements were determined by Hartley

Aand Adeney.-  selection from these had been utilised for the investi-

gation of absorption spectra. Liveing and Dewar ' published the arc and

spark spectra of iron and some other metals, but it had been previously

found ^ that the spark spectrum of iron was unsuitable for such work. By

the use of electrodes containing the metals lead, tin, and cadmium, and

occasionally for special purposes copper and bismuth, a large number of

reference lines of known wave-length were available, and a greater degree

of accuracy was now attainable in the measurement of absorption bands.

It became more convenient to describe the absorption spectra in

terms of the oscillation frequencies of the absorbed rays than in wave-

lengths. As, however, the actual oscillation frequencies per second of

time were inconveniently large numbers, the inverse wave-lengths were

employed, their accuracy being even greater than the measurements of

absorption spectra will admit of, and they answer the purpose though

the unit of time is but a small fraction of the second.

         On the Various Combinations which show Continuous

                                  Absorption Spectra Only.

     It had been shown by Hartley '^ (1) that neither the olefines, acetylene
nor amyl-alcohol show absorption hands ; (2) that in all cases ivhere the
carbon atoms are supposed to be arranged in an open chain, no absorption
hands are seen ; (3) that the replacement of Ji in any compound by the

radicals of the formula C,,H2,,+i, or C,,H2,,_i, by NH^, OH, COOH, or by

SO3H, has no influence on the jjrodmtioyi of absorption hands ; (4) ivhen

Hhalogens are substituted for in a compound, and the result is a colour-

less body, no hands are caused to ap)pear in its sjjectrum. It was then
pointed out *" that when an atom of carbon is united to an atom of
nitrogen, no absorption bands are seen in the ultra-violet spectrum trans-
mitted by such a combination. This conclusion was drawn in the first

instance from the results of Dr. W. A. Miller and of M. L. Soret, but

independent observations were made on hydrocyanic acid and potassium
cyanide, using very strong solutions and greater thicknesses of liquid-
The results furnished the following conclusion :

     The si7nple union of carbon to nitrogen does not cause selective absorp-
tion qf the ultra-violet rays.

   A conclusion regarding cyanuric acid was formed which ha3 since been

found to be erroneous. The examination of a very fine specimen gave an
absorption band of a character indicating that the substance was inter-
mediate in compactness of structure between benzene and benzene-hexa-

chloride.^

      Recent experiments have proved from the examination of several
newly made preparations, and of a portion of the original specimen, that
it has no absorption band in its spectrum.

      Special difficulties are encountered in the examination of the spectrum
of cyanuric acid, owing to its slight solubility in cold water or even in

water which is warm. Thicknesses of a warm solution of 100 and
200 mm. were examined. It contained 2 "5 grains of the substance
in 500 c.c. With 100 mm. of solution the spectrum was found to
be cut off sharply at ^/X 4027. With a thickness of 200 mm. it termi-

nated sharply about y\ 3888, but the spectrum was weakened from

about \/\ 3000. The band originally described was situated between
^/\ 3640 and 3888, and was therefore in the weakened part of the

spectrum.

altered to the following :

     The absorption of the ultra-violet rays by solutions of some of these
substances, and particularly thiophene, is very intense, but in no case is
there any selective absorption.

     It is necessary now to refer back to a series of papers included under

the heading ' Researches on the Relation between the Molecular Structure
of Carbon Compounds and their Absorption Spectra. '

            On Molecular and Intramolecular Vibrations.

     In the 'Chem. Soc. Trans.,' vol. xxxix. p. 161, 1881, the spectra of
condensed benzene nuclei were examined, such as are obtained from
naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene. The diagrams of the absorp-
tion spectra of these substances were drawn to scale, and they shoM^
enormous differences in the intensity of the absorption bands in these
different hydrocarbons as well as differences in the positions of the bands.
Por instance, six bands were measured in the spectrum of benzene, and
four of these are visible when one part is diluted with 2,400 of alcohol
then in naphthalene with a dilution of 1 in 100,000 parts, one in phenan-
threne with 1 in 500,000 parts, and one in anthracene with 1 in 5,000,000
parts, the thickness of the layer of liquid in each case being only 15
millimetres. In February, ISSl,-* it was stated that the mean wave-length

of the rays intercepted by ozone is 2,560 tenth-metres. Prom this the

mean rate of vibration of the molecule of ozone can be calculated. When

perfect absorption occurs, the molecule of the absorbing medium must be
vibrating synchronously, and in the same plane with the ray absorbed,

from which it follows, if the velocity of light be taken as 315,364,000

metres per second (Pizeau), the mean rate of vibration per second of time of
the molecule of ozone must amount to 1,231,000,000,000,000 vibrations.

On the Cause (f Absolution Bands in the Spectra transmitted by Benzene and its

                                                             Derivatives}

     It was pointed out that in the absorption of ultra-violet rays by hydro-
carbons of the aromatic series we have two kinds of absorption made
manifest, namely, a general and a selective absorption. It is the selective
absorption which distinguishes these from all other compounds of whatever

class, so far as our knowledge at present extends.
     While the absorption spectrum of alcohols and fatty acids and amines

depends upon and varies with the molecular weight of the compounds, or,
more strictly expressed, with the number of carbon atoms in the molecule,
in aromatic compounds it depends entirely on the structure of the molecule.

     For instance, a terpene, CmHi^, is much more strongly diactinic than

naphthalene, CjoHg, and benzene hexachloride, CuHjjClg, than benzene,

CijHg. Cymene, CmHu, or CH, -0,3114 CH(CH3)2, p. methyl-isopropyl-

benzene, if compared with naphthalene, C,nHjj, is found to possess only

one- fifth the absorptive power of the latter, and it gives a very different
spectrum. There is a similar difference between anthracene and phenan-

threne, both with the composition Ci.,H[(,. Such a diflerence is quite

usual with isomerides of the aromatic series.

    When the molecule of a substance is capable of vibrating synchronously

with a radiation, the ray received on this substance is absorbed. The ab-

sorption is complete if the direction of the vibration of the ray and of the

molecule is the same, but the ])hase opposite. It is evident that general

actinic absorption, exerted by carbon compounds, is due to the vibrations

of the molecules, since absorption increases in extent with the number of

carbon atoms in the molecule, or, in other words, in any homologous series

the greater the molecular mass the lower the rate of vibration of the

molecule. Selective absorption appears to be caused by the vibration of

atoms or atomic groupings within the molecule.

    When a substance such as benzene absorbs all rays more refrangible

than /\ 2743, it is because the molecules are vibrating synchronously with

these rays, and the number of molecules within the path of the rays is

sufficient to damp all vibrations. When the liquid is diluted the number

of molecules present is not sufficient to damp all the vibrations, and some

rays are transmitted.

If, however, certain carbon atoms within the molecule are vibrating

.synchronously with certain rays, we shall have selective absorption of

these rays after the general absorption has been so weakened by dilution

as to allow them to pass. It was not found possible to associate any of

the absorption bands of the substances examined with any particular

carbon atoms                                                     furthermore,  it was  shown that  the intra-molecular vibra-
                                                              ;

tions were dependent upon the vibrations of the molecules.

From numbers representing approximately the mean wave-lengths of

the four chief bands of rays absorbed by benzene, naphthalene, and

anthracene, and from the velocity of light, the mean rate of vibration of

the molecules of benzene, naphthalene, and anthi'acciie were calculated.

     The mean rate of vibration of the rays absorbed by naphthalene is
less than that absorbed by benzene, and those of anthracene less than
those of naphthalene. It follows from this that the vibrations within the

molecules are not independent of but are a consequence of the funda-
mental molecular vibrations, like the harmonics of a stretched string, or

a bell. When the rate of the vibration is reduced by the increase in mass

of the molecule, the rate of vibrations of the carbon atoms is reduced in a

similar ratio.

     In the case of a vibrating string or tuning-fork, greater amplitude of
vibration means a louder note ; in the case of a luminous vibration it

means a brighter light ; consequently the converse of this should hold
good, that a greater intensity of absorption is caused by a greater ampli-
tude of vibration in the molecules of the absorbing medium, the number
of molecules remaining constant. Hence it follows that as the absorbing

power of anthracene and naphthalene is, molecule for molecule, greater
than that of benzene, the amplitude of vibration of the molecules of these
substances is greater. Now, the mean rate of vibration of the rays
absorbed by naphthalene and anthracene is less than that of the rays
absorbed by benzene, though the character of the absorption is the same

in each case. Hence we may conclude that though the wave-form is

similar, the amplitude of the vibrations is greater, and the rate of vibra-

tions is slower.

From the foregoing views it will be observed that where X is the

wave-length,  ^/X  is  the  oscillation frequency  in  a  small  unit  of  time
                                                                                              ;

omitting the correction for the refraction of air, which is a very small

amount, and in representing absorption bands by inverse wave-lengths,

we refer them directly to the oscillation frequencies of the absorbed rays,

^/X, a very convenient mode of representing them.

It will be seen in dealing with coloured substances that Gerard Kriiss,

seven years later, in 1888,' also ^ gives expression to similar views, which

are thus stated in his papers.

     Although the kinetic energy of gases gives some account of the trans-
lation of molecules through space, yet no satisfactory hypothesis has been
brought forward to illustrate either the rotation of the molecules about

their own axes, or the interatomic movements within the molecules.
These two last the author terms 'inner molecular movements.' From
the undulatory theory of light, deductions may be drawn regarding these

inner molecular movements, inasmuch as the vibrations of the ether,
which fills the intramolecular space, are a resultant within that space
of the velocity and amplitude of the molecular vibrations.

     Thus, if X be the wave-length of a ray emitted by a substance, v the
velocity of light, the number of vibrations, n, which a molecule sends
forth by movements of it as a whole and of its parts, can be determined

=by the equation, tc ^ . The phenomena of emission and of absorption
                                    X
spectra thus throw some light on the least and most extensive form of

this inner molecular movement. The latter point is discussed, together
with relation to the interatomic attraction, which is subject to the chemical
constitution of the molecule ; inasmuch as the vibrations of the particles
of a body are capable of being excited only by vibrations of a like period

in the external ether, so from the wave-lengths of those rays of light
which are absorbed to the greatest degree by the solution of any sub-
stance the number of the vibrations of the molecules within the liquid
can be calculated from the equation given. The number of vibrations for

billionths of a second were calculated for indigo, rosolic acid, fluorescein,
and their various derivatives, the absorption spectra of which had been

examined. These will be referred to later on.

                   The Spectra of Tertiary Bases.

These substances are of particular interest, owing to their connection

with the natural alkaloids.
     Cinchomeronic acid, the pyridine dicarboxylic acid obtained by the

oxidation of quinine, &c. with potassium permanganate, has a strong

--absorption band between \ 2743 and X. 2574.
AnPicoline.        alcoholic solution containing ottott^'^ °^ *^^ substance

shows a strong absorption band lying beyond X 2743, but a broad band of

rays is fully transmitted further on. Solutions containing soTnjoth show

a strong absorption band lying between X 2743 and X 2574. The absorp-

tion band is nan-owed but is not destroyed by dilution to l ooo oo^^^-

Since picoline is a methyl-pyridine it follows that

     The siihstituiion of nitrogen for carbon in the benzene nucleus does
tiot destroy or impair the power of selective absorption possessed by the

d'iginal molecule.

The substitution of nitrogen for carbon in the benzene ring really

removes an atom of hydrogen. This action greatly increases the absorp-
tive power of the substance, as will be seen by comparing methyl-benzene
(toluene) ^ with picoline or methyl-pyridine. There is a striking resem-

blance between the two spectra, but the narrow band characteristic of the

homologues of benzene is absent.
-- AQuinoline.
                   solution of this substance in alcohol containing i o-Jiro^^^

shows one narrow band a little beyond X 3076. Two narrow bands and a

broad one are seen in solutions containing T3-{yooth, and a trace of absorp-

tion continues until the dilution has reached ouJ-uu^h. This spectrum is

a remarkable one.

Comparing picoline with toluene, and quinoline with naphthalene, the

chief difference to be noted in their absorption spectra is the increased

intensity of absorption in the case of the nitrogen compounds.

                        By J. L. SoRET and A. A. Rilliet.^

     There is considerable difficulty in obtaining compounds of sufficient
purity for observations on the ultra-violet rays. The alcohols were found
to show great transparency to the ultra-violet, and any apparent excep-
tions were probably due to impurities. In the rectification and
prolonged desiccation of the alcohols there is often slight oxidation, which
leads to the production of impurities which affect the results of an exami-
nation. Hartley and Huntington concluded that in the series of alcohols

the absorption of the ultra-violet increased as the complexity of the
molecules increases in any homologous series. It was found, however, by

Soret and Rilliet that when the process of drying was rapidly executed,

ethyl alcohol is not appreciably less diactinic than methyl alcohol.
Ketones, it was found, are strongly adiactinic, but any differences which
were perceived were not gi^eater than might be attributed to small
quantities of impurities which it is difficult to exclude. Pure ether is
almost as transparent as pure water, to the ultra-violet spectrum. In
dealing with haloid derivatives it was found that the substitution of one
alkyl for another has very little effect upon their transparency, and this
is particularly well marked in iodides.

     It is concluded that the action on the ultra-violet rays constitutes a
very delicate test of the purity of an organic substance.

   --Note on Soret and Rilliet's Observations. The difficulty in obtaining

compounds derived from the paraffins of sufficient purity was found by
Hartley and Huntington to be so great, in the case of hydrocarbons, that
after repeated trials all hope of obtaining a sufficient number of pure

homologues was abandoned. As a rule, substances were examined imme-

diately after they had been submitted to a final distillation and their
boiling points taken. In the case of ethyl alcohol, it was difficult to
obtain it quite free from traces of other substances, which affected its
spectrum. Samples were dehydrated finally by standing over freshly burnt
lime for twelve hours, and then submitted to distillation. This process
was recommended by Dupre. Haloid derivatives are remarkable for their

transparency, particularly those of chlorine.

     With the organic acids of the fatty series great difficulty was experi-
enced, and this is mentioned in the original memoir. In place of the

acids themselves salts were taken, but such anomalous results were
obtained with the same substance that a careful examination led to the
discovery of such substances as formates being oxidised to oxalates by
the process of evaporation and crystallisation. To obviate the difficulties
which were thus encountered barium or calcium salts were crystallised, by
which means any oxalate formed remained insoluble.

      Measured in terms of wave-lengths, the actual difference between
ethyl alcohol, methylic alcohol, and pure water is very small. In fact,
methylic alcohol is very slightly different in this respect from water.
This is shown on Plate 1 in the ' Phil. Trans.' 1879.

     In this paper the results of the examination of the absorption spectra
of the following substances are given :

     (1) Aromatic hydrocarbons : benzene and naphthalene.

hydro-quinoline, and its hydrochloride.

   --Tltp I'r>iparation of Solutions and Method ofExamination. In dealing

with a variety of nearly related substances from which similar solutions
have to be prepared, it is necessary that the solution of the least soluble
substance (largest solution) shall, as far as possible, serve as a standard
for the preparation of the other solutions. It was found most convenient
to take a molecular weight in milligrams and dissolve it in 20 c.c. of
absolute alcohol or any other menstruum better suited to the particular

--substance. In this way molecular weights were distributed through that

is to say, made to occupy equal volumes. The solutions, instead of being
repeatedly diluted and examined in cells of the same thickness, were
placed in a series of cells varying in thickness from 25 to 1 mm. ; if with
a thickness of 1 mm. absorption bands were still visible, the liquid was
diluted to five times its original volume, and another series of photographs
taken ranging from 5 mm. downwards.

      The wave-lengths in tenth-metres have been converted into reciprocal
numbers, which have the advantage of representing oscillation frequencies

per unit of time.

    When a series of photographs had been secured which gave sufficient

information from which a curve could be drawn indicating both the

general and the selective absorption, the oscillation frequencies of the
absorbed rays were taken as abscissse and the proportional thicknesses in

mm. of the weakest solution as ordinates. The curves are made con-

tinuous, and a careful description of the spectra obtained by transmitting

rays through varying thicknesses of the solutions is intended to supple-

ment the curves and serve the purpose of the shaded diagrams which had

hitherto been employed.^

      It will be convenient here to introduce some recent measurements of

the bands in the spectrum of benzene.

   --(1) Aromatic hydrocarbons. The absorption spectrum of benzene shows

six absorption bands, while that of naphthalene shows four.

   --(2) Aromatic tertiary bases and their salts. In the case of the

bases and their hydrochlorides, the method of examination consisted

in photographing the spectra, transmitted by the base contained in
one series, and the molecule of hydrochloric acid contained in another,

the rays from the spark passing through both. The contents of the
two series of cells being then mixed and returned to their original
vessels, a second series of photographs was taken. As the hydro-
 chloric acid proved perfectly diactinic, the first spectra represent the
 absorption caused by the base alone, the second that caused by the salt.
The difference in the mode of vibration of the base, the acid, and the

 salt, is very striking ; the amplitude of the vibrations within the molecule

of the salt being much less, as one would imagine, than in that of the
 base. The absorption spectra of pyridine and its hydrochloride, of dipyri-
dine, and picoline, show one absorption band each. Two specimens of

 quinoline wex'e examined ; one prepared from coal-tar, and the other
 synthetically by Skraup's reaction. The absorption spectra of the two
 specimens were identical, and showed three absorption bands.

332 REPORT-- 1899.

   --(3) Addition p'l'odicds of tertiary bases and salts. Piperidine has no

power of selective absorption ; this was predicted from the behaviour of
benzene hexachloride, which also has no power of selective absorption.
Tetra-hydro-quinoline, on the other hand, has still the power of selective
absorption, and its spectrum shows one absorption band.

   --(4) Primary and secondary aromatic bases or amido-derivatives and

their salts. Both ortho- and para-toluidine and their hydrochlorides show
an absorption band.

     (5) The absorption spectra of ortho- and meta-xylene both show an
absorption band ; that of para-xylene shows two absorption bands.

      These substances being, unlike other isomeric bodies formerly examined,
free from oxygen, afford a means of estimating the differences in molecular
absorption which is due to nothing more than the so-called relative

functions of the compound radicals.
     The area enclosed by the curve of metaxylene appears to be the least,

that of orthoxylene stands next, while that of paraxylene is the greatest.

     The following deductions were drawn from the investigations :

     1. When an atom of nitrogen is substituted for an atom of carbon in

the benzene or naphthalene nucleus, the property of selective absorption is

still retained.

     This had already been inferred from an examination of picoline.'

     2. When the condensation of the carbon and nitrogen in themolecide of
a benzeno'id compound or tertiary base is modified by the addition thereto
of an atom, of hydrogen to each atom of carbon and nitrogen, the jiower of

selective absorption is destroyed.

     .3. When the condensation of the carbon atoms in quinoline is modified

by the combination therewith offour atoms of hydrogen, the intensity of the
selective absorption is reduced but is not destroyed.

   --4. Molecides of comjwunds that is to say, molecules composed of dis-

--similar atoms vibrate as wholes or units, and the fundamental vibrations

give rise to secondary vibrations which stand in no visible relation to the
chemical constituents of the molecule, whether these be atoms or smaller

molecules.

    When benzene is examined with a wide slit, lenses of long focus, and

a powerful spark, a remarkable feature is noticeable in the spectra photo-
graphed. The absorption bands are seen to be degraded in the direction
of the least refrangible rays, suggesting that the bands consist of groups
of lines stronger and closer together on the more refrangible side ; weaker
and wider apart on the less refrangible. Such were the conditions under

which the first photographs were taken. By using a very powerful spark,

but with an instrument of short focus and a narrow slit, the rays emitted

by cadmium electrodes may be rendered sufiiciently continuous to show

these bands, and at the same time to render the hnes sharp enough to
serve as a scale of wave length measurements.

     The series of independent measurements obtained from photographs
taken under the latter conditions, when compared with those obtained by
Pauer by examining the vapour of benzene,' show that his weak line
X 2670 is identical with the first absorption band, and his weak band
\ 2390-2360 with the sixth absorption band observed in solutions of
benzene in alcohol. The result of Pauer's work was to show that the
constitution of the absorption bands in benzene, when the substance is
vaporised, is that of lines, or groups of closely adjacent lines. The
action of a solvent is to cause the lines to be dispersed or merged into

bands.

  ' Ueber Absorption cles Lichts durch Gemische von farhigen Flilssigkeiten'

                                    By F. E. Melde.i

     Melde chiefly addressed himself to the following inquiries :

     Do the absorption bands which a coloured substance exhibits remain

if the liquid be mixed with one or more other coloured solutions, without
any chemical interaction taking place 1 Is it possible for the change of
temperature in a liquid which exhibits selective absorption to cause a
shifting of the absorption bands 1 His results showed that there was an
alteration which was believed to be of a physical character. H. Burger ^
was strengthened in the belief that the changes observed by Melde were
not merely physical, but partly chemical, taking into account the work of

Magnus and H. W. Vogel.^

     The subject was investigated very carefully by J. Landauer,^ chiefly
as a contribution towards a settlement of the question Avhether every

chemical compound had its own absorption spectrum.'' He under-

took the spectral analytical examination of saffranin and its salts, since
it has the very peculiar property of changing colour on the addition of
concentrated acids in varying proportions to the red solution.'' It became

evident that each of the colours had its own spectrum . The green solu-

tions extinguished the violet, the blue, and the red ; the blue-green
behaved in similar manner until there was a portion of the red rays
remaining which were not absorbed ; tlie blue solution took away merely
the yellow rays, and the more the colour was changed to violet and red
by addition of water, the more the spectrum went over to the green part.
Drawings of the spectra of thick and thin layers of liquid show the
movement of the absorption band from the red and yellow towards the

green and blue, while a second absorption band about F and G moves

into the more refrangible region, and goes, no doubt, into the ultra-
violet. The change is caused by the formation of diflerent hydrates in
solution, which are capable of being carried possibly as far as complete
dehydration. The addition of water of course reverses the change.

Similar colour effects are produced by evaporating the solution of these
salts, particularly of the sulphate. There are three hydrates formed, and
eventually two hydrates and an anhydrous salt.

Ueber die Wandlung der Spectren verschiedener Farhstpffe}

                    By Hermann W. Vogel.

It is a known fact that absorption spectra of one and the same

substance dissolved in different liquids do not always show the absorption

bands in the same position. According to Kundt's law the broadening or

shifting of the bands towards the red occurs owing to the greater

dispersion or refraction equivalent of the solvent liquid, and this law holds

good in very many cases. But there are cases where, on a change in the

liquid solvent, there is no shifting towards the red, but on the contrary,

towards the violet. In other instances even where the solvent liquid has

no chemical action upon the dissolved substance, the whole character of

Athe spectrum changes.  case in point is purpurin, which shows two

beautiful absorption bands on F, the h group, and E, when dissolved in

alcohol, but these bands are not seen in an aqueous solution. Naphthalene

red shows very different absorption spectra according as it is dissolved in

alcohol, in water, in resin, or is solid, or used oo colour paper. The curves

representing the absorption in the several cases are different. Coloured

gelatine behaves in a similar manner to the solid substance.

    He refers to the researches on uranium salts made by Morton and

Carrington Bolton, and gives the spectra of a number of inorganic

coloured substances.

          Ueber die Verschiedenheit der Absorptionssjyectra eines und
                  desselben Stoffes? By Hermann W. Vogel.

     The substances examined were corallin and fuchsin in alcoliol, water,
and in the solid state, and the absorption bands were found to be the
same iii the solution, and but slightly shifted towards the less refrangible
end according to Kundt's law. Curves are shown in the original paper.
The solid substances showed somewhat different bands from the solutions,

not so strong in the case of fuchsin, and lying nearer the green. He

examined also indigo vapour in thick and thin layers, in the solid state,

and in solution. He compared the spectrum with that of anilin-blue in

water and alcohol, cyanine, and methyl-violet both solid and dissolved

in alcohol.

    He dissolved purpurin in carbon disulphide, but could not see he

bands described by Stokes.^
     The following conclusions were drawn from Vogel's work :

      1. There is a remarkable difference between the spectra of a single
substance in the solid, in the liquid or dissolved, and in the gaseous

state. Characteristic absorption bands which appear in one state of
aggregation, either do not appear at all in another, or the bands are
markedly altered in position, in intensity, or in appearance. The same
absorption spectrum is shown by chlorophyll and by copper sulphate in
the solid as well as in the dissolved state.

     2. The spectra which one and the same substance yields in different
solvents are indistinguishable in many cases, in other instances they are
distinguished by the width of their bands, in othei's by a total difference
in their characters, so that the spectra in no way correspond.

     3. The rule given by Kundt that the absorption bands are shifted

farther towards the red the stronger the dispersion of the liquid which is

used as a solvent, is not satisfied in many cases. Sometimes the bands

are shifted towards the blue, e.g., uranium nitrate in water and alcohol
and blue cobalt chloi'ide in water and alcohol. Sometimes there is a
strong alteration in the sense of Kundt's rule, and in other cases in the

same region of rays the alteration is but trifling. Many absorption

bands show in different media of solution the same or veiy neai'ly the
same position, while at the same time others are shifted.

     4. The position of absorption bands in the spectra of solid and dis-
solved substances can only in exceptional cases be of value as character-
istic of the particular substance. Substances which are totally different
exhibit bands in (almost) exactly the same positions. Very analogous

substances exhibit in like proportions striking differences in the position
of their bands. ^

     5. The law for absorption spectra, every substance has its own

spectrum,^ is only admissible in a very restricted sense.

     The great number of polychroic substances show different colours and
different spectra in the solid state, and it is a question which of these is
to be regarded in the case of any one substance as its own special

spectrum

 chemical changes within the solutions, it became of interest to ascertain

the nature of the chemical reactions involved. The replacements of

hydrogen by alkyls, nitroxyl, and amidogen was the subject of investiga-

tion. The autliors state that the subject had been partially investigated

by Dunstan, Soret, and others, and appear to quote from the ' Pharm.

Trans.' vol. xi. p. 54. In attributing work of the kind to Dunstan they were
in error, and this misstatement has been repeated by other authors in
different publications. Their experiments were made upon indigo and its

derivatives, in. methyl-indigo, m. oxymethyl-indigo, ethyl-indigo, mono-
brom-indigo, dibrom-indigo, amido-indigo, and dibrom-amido-indigo, and

show that the alkyl and oxyalkyl radicals shift the absorption bands

towards the red, and that oxymethyl and ethyl exert a similar influence

Anto methyl and ethyl, but are stronger in effect.                                                      atom of bromine

causes but little change, but the introduction of a second atom is equal in

effect to a methyl group. It is stated that nitroxyl- and amido-groups

have a reverse effect.

   --Note on the above-mentioned papers. No accurate conclusions of a

general character can be drawn from observations on a part of the
spectrum such as was in this case made with a molecule of complex
structure like indigo. It is necessary to take into account the effect on

the ultra-violet, and undoubtedly thei-e the effect of NO2 is to shift the

bands towards the red, and that of NH., is the same when the molecule
into which these radicals enter is a simple one like benzene.

    This is shown in the diagrams of Hartley and Huntington. · Com-

pare benzene, aniline, with ortho- and para-nitraniline, phenol with ortho-
nitrophenol and para-nitro phenol.^

     Kriiss and (Economides examined (1883) solutions of indigo and its
derivatives, with a view to decide whether the replacement of hydrogen
by CH;j, C0H5, ISrH2, NOo, Br., itc, has a regular influence on the absorp-
tion spectrum of the compound. Derivatives of fluorescein and rosolic
acid were examined by Kriiss subsequently, with the result that the view
previously put forward, namely, that the replacement of hydrogen in the
benzene-ring or in the side chain by alkyl or oxyalkyl radicals and bro-
mine, caused a shifting of the absorption bands towards the less refrangible

end of the spectrum, whilst the introduction of an NHj or NO2 has the

opposite effect. The shifting of the bands increases in proportion to the
number of substituted hydrogen atoms, when the same elements or radi-

cals are analogously introduced.

     In the case of alkyl radicals this also has been shown by Hartley and
Huntington. Compare the plates of benzene, methyl-benzene, trimethyl-
benzene, ethyl-benzene,' also pyridine and picoline (Hartley). It is par-
ticularly to be noted in the case of the general absorption and in the more
pronounced intensity of the bands, which,. however, do not, in the case of
alkyl radicals, greatly alter throughout all dilutions in mere position.

1888. He was apparently quite unaware that the method of calculating

the molecular vibrations of a substance had, seven years previously, been
described in the 'Journal of the Chemical Society,' for 1881, and calcu-

lated for benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene, in a manner identical
with that which he communicates. This is rendered evident from his
article on absorption spectra in Graham-Otto's ' Ausfiihi'liches Lehrbuch
der Chemie,' erster Band, pp. 683-694, edited by Dr. H. Landoltin 189S.

There is an obituary notice of the author by Dr. Hugo Kriiss, stating

that this contribution was completed in 1889.

       Necessity for Examining the Ultra-violet and Coloured
                                         Spectra together.

     There is some amount of uncertainty about conclusions drawn from
observations made on only a part of the spectrum which may be illustrated
by a glance at the diagram in Hartley and Huntington's paper, plate 22,
which is described as that of oi'tho-nitrophenol, but is in reality the para-
compound, and that of plate 23, erroneously termed para-nitrophenol, but
is in reality the ortho-derivative (by accident the plates were transposed).
In both instances there are two absorption bands, one in the visible

region or blue, in No. 23, and a second in the ultra-violet. Any reaction

which will reduce the velocity of the vibrations of the compound will

shift both bands towards the less refrangible rays. The first band may

thus be moved into the infra-red region, and the second into the visible

part of the spectra, say the violet. By observations on the coloured rays
only, it will be made to appear as if the first band had been moved

towards the ultra-violet instead of in the opposite direction.

  -- --Another example an actual case is afforded by iodine green,

methyl violet and rosaniline hydrochloride, when compared with triphenyl
methane. The powerfvil absorption band of the hydrocarbon is cairied
down into the yellow and green by the influence on the molecule of the

NHj groups and the chlorine ; the red rays are transmitted, and a por-

tion of the violet. In the case of methyl violet, the absorption band is

Gcarried down to a point near C, and it extends to ; a portion therefore

of the red is transmitted, and part of the violet. With iodine green the
absorption band in the less refrangible region extends into the extreme

Alimit of visibility in the red, and there is absorption from between

and B i/\ 1800, until near F V'^ 2000 a band of transmitted rays extends
from ^/\ 2000 to 2200, or between F and G. There is then absorption

in the violet from ^/X 2200 to 2800 in the ultra-violet, and beyond that
again there is complete absorption from ^/X 2900 to 4000.

     If the visible rays only ai-e obsei'ved, and that at one thickness and
one strength of solution, it might very easily appear that the combined

effect of NHo, the CH3 groujj, and the I is to cause the band to be

shifted from "the yellow into the violet. Plate I. ' Chem. Soc. Trans.

1887, will serve to explain this. It will be well at this juncture to refer
to the paper more fully.

which in amount approximates to 40 micro-millimetres.

Liebermann ^ examined the spectra of alkyl derivatives of oxyanthra-

quinones dissolved in cold strong sulphuric acid. The wave-lengths of

bands measured are as follows :

     (2) The substitution of /3-naphthol disulphonic acid S, or /3-naphthol

Rdisulphonic acid for /3-naphthol sulphonic acid B, causes a shifting of

the bands, which in the case of /8-naphthol sulphonic acid S amounts to

from 4 to 5 millionths of a millimetre.

     (3) In the substitution of methyl the space between the two bands
becomes clearer, and the bands become more equal in intensity and width.

     The substitution of /3-naphthol sulphonic acid S or /3-naphthol di-
sulphonic acid R, in the place of the acid B, acts in a similar manner on
the character of the bands. The solutions were made both with alcohol

and with strong sulphuric acid.

   Observations on the Origin op Colour and on Fluorescence.^

     Anthracene is shown to possess a very definite absorption band in the
violet, and it is therefore a truly coloured substance. Its colour is the
aggregate effect on the retina of those rays which are the complement in
white light of the violet rays absorbed. The complementary colour to
the violet can be seen only by transmission. Hence the colour which is
due to fluorescence must be excluded from access to the eye, and also
all reflected light. It is therefore necessary to look directly through thin
layers of the substance, or to view it by transmitted light when the sub-

stance is fused. When examined in this manner, anthracene is seen even

in very thin layers to have a greenish yellow colour. This colour belongs
to only the very purest specimens.

     Nietzki has stated that all hydrocarbons are colourless,^ but this is
not strictly the case. Anthracene is not the only hydrocarbon which

possesses colour visible to the human eye. De la Harpe and Van Dorp ^

obtained a red hydrocarbon, C26H11;, by passing fluorene over heated lead
oxide. Mantz * established its molecular weight by Raoult's method, and
ass*i»g*ned it the structural formula

     C. Graebe's investigation ^ shows that the colour truly belongs to the

substance, and that it becomes brighter in colour the more highly it is

purified. He attributes the colour to the grouping > C : C <, as both the

dibromide and the hydrocarbon CogHjg are colourless.

    It may be remarked that the carbon grouping C : < cannot alone

Hbe the cause of the colour, for if the carbons are united to atoms or to

alkyl radicals it may be safely predicted that no colour would result. It

is this nucleus united to four benzene rings, each pair of which are them-
selves united, and so forming molecules with a great compactness of
structure, which is the cause of the colour. Benzene is a substance with

invisible colour, that is to say it exerts a powerful selective absorption in
the invisible region, and by any series of chemical reactions which serve

to retard the rate of vibration of the molecule, or of any group of ben-

zenes united in one molecule, will cause the invisible colours of the ultra-
violet region to become visible.

     Triphenylmethane absorbs all the ultra-violet rays down to H, anthra-
cene all the ultra-violet as well as a band of violet rays ; the former is

therefore all but a substance with visible colour, the latter is undoubtedly
a coloured substance. But bi-diphenyleneetliylene is strongly coloured,
and the nature of its colour is such as to show that it absorbs the violet,
blue, and green rays. These hydrocarbons constitute an interesting illus-
tration of the passage from a substance which just falls short of being
coloured to one which is but faintly, and to a third which is strongly

coloured.

Researches on the Relation between the Molecular Structure of Carbon

    Compounds and their Absor2Jtion Spectra. Part VIII. A Study of

     Coloured Substances and Dyes. (Hartley.)^

According to Dr. Otto Witt - the tinctorial character is conditional

upon the simultaneous presence of a colour-producing group (chromogen)

and a salt- forming group (chromophore) in the molecule. This investigation
includes a study of the hydrocai-bons in their relation to the more com-

plex colouring compounds derived therefrom, considered in the light of

Witt's views.

   A perfectly colourless substance transmits all luminous and invisible

vibrations without impairing their intensity ; a coloured substance absorbs
rays at either end of the spectrum, even beyond the limits of visibility, or

say from \ 7800 to A. 2000, or it selects rays from the middle of the spec-

trum. Every fluorescent substance is therefore in a certain sense

coloured, because it absorbs certain rays whether in the visible or
ultra-violet region. Benzene, benzenoid hydrocarbons, phenols, &c., which

exhibit selective absorption, are also coloured, although the eye, owing to

absorption of the ultra-violet rays by the aqueous humour,^ has a range of

vision limited by the red and violet ends of the spectrum, and therefore can-

not appreciate this variety of colour. Bands of selective absorption, it has

been shown, are to be attributed to the effect of vibrations taking place within
the molecules of a substance upon the rays which enter the substance, and

are dependent upon the rate of vibration of the molecules themselves. To

--convert a carbon compound, therefore, such as benzene which, owing to its

--powerful absorption in the ultra-violet, may be said to have invisible colour

into a compound with visible colour, it is only necessary to slacken its rate

of vibration so that the molecule will absorb rays with oscillation fre-

quencies occurring within the limits of visibility. Or, to put it in another

way, the absorption band in the ultra-violet is transferred to rays of

Alower refrangibility.  chromogen is an invisibly coloured substance ; a

chromophore is an atom, or group of atoms, capable of reducing the rate

of vibration of the molecules, with the result that it absoi-bs rays which are

within the limits of visibility of the human eye. Instances of chi'omo-

phores are afforded by oxygen and nitrogen, as in hydroxyl and nitroxyl.
Or more rarely in the case of oxygen, when united to carbon, as in uric

acid. Two benzene molecules doubly linked by two nitrogen atoms

--N=N -- as in azo-benzene, have their mode of vibration so modified that

a colour as low down in the scale as the yellow rays is the result. These
nitrogens are chi'omophores. Again, when two atoms of hydrogen in
benzene are replaced by two atoms of oxygen as in quinone, a golden colour
results. In this case the oxygen atoms are chromophores. The chromo-
phoric properties of oxygen atoms when united in a certain manner to
carbon, and especially to benzene nuclei, are strikingly illustrated by such

bodies as resorcin-phthalein, &c.

    When methyl is substituted for hydrogen in benzene, three of the

absorption bands are merged in one, and the oscillation frequencies of the
rays absorbed are reduced, or in other words the general absorption is

increased. The OH, NHo, and NOo radicals invariably act in this manner

whether absorption bands are shifted or not.

The absorption curve of this substance has the same general character as

that of benzene, with the following modifications. There is one broad

absorption band with just an indication of a second one being merged in

this. The amplitude of the vibrations, as shown by the intensity of the

absorption bands, is very largely increased, and the rate of vibration of the

Aabsorbed rays is very greatly reduced.                   milligram molecule of benzene,

for instance, begins to transmit rays with oscillation frequencies 3760 and

4330, while li^-rth of a milligram molecule transmits all rays as far as

On carefully comparing the curves of the rosaniline series of dyes

with triphenyl-methane and benzene, it is seen that they are modifications
of the benzene curve. All these curves are drawn to scale. The closeness
of relationship of the triphenyl-methane curve to the dyes is much greater

than that of the benzene curve, and the curves of the three dyes are

modified in such a manner that they follow each other closely. The

modification is such that the molecules of greatest mass transmit the least

light, and the light is composed of rays vibrating with least rapidity, thus

indicating, in the case of the dyes, a greater amplitude and less rapidity

of vibration than that of the molecule of triphenyl-methane, while the

difference in this respect between this substance and benzene is extra-

ordinary.

     In these substances the amplitude of the vibrations is virtually the

no two are alike. These substances are very varied as regards the hydro-

the nitrogen is largely concerned in the development of the colours, and
that the hydrocarbon radicals are of comparatively small importance so
long as they are benzenoid in character.

  --Murexide. Uric acid, which is closely related to murexide, exhibits an

extraordinary absorption band when an aqueous solution of the acid is

examined in layers 15 millimetres in thickness. Since the substance
requires 15,000 parts of Avater for its solution, this is some indication of
the extraordinary absorptive power of uric acid and of the effect of the
linking of several carbon and nitrogen atoms, and the combination of
oxygen atoms with carbon. Urea is extraordinarily diactinic.

     The curves of the rosaniline series of dyes are modifications of the
benzene curve, standing, however, in a closer relationship to the curve of
triphenylmethane than to that of benzene itself. The curves are modified
in such a manner that the molecules of greatest mass transmit least light,
and the light is composed of rays vibrating with least rapidity, thus indi-
cating greater amplitude and less rapidity of vibration of the molecule.

The curves of the azo-colours are likewise modifications of the azobenzene

curves.

   A general conclusion drawn from this work is that token absorption

takes jjlace in the visible region the ultra-violet rays are also absorbed. It
appears, therefore, hopeless to expect a strongly coloured organic sub-

stance to transmit the ultra-violet rays.

that, first, an increase in the percentage of carbon causes the absorp-

secondly, the wave-lengths of bands of absorption are the same in different

thionine salts, whether the solution contains hydrochloride, hydriodide, or

other salts of this base ; thirdly, the addition of hydrogen causes the

bands to pass towards the blue ; fourthly, if a substance is examined

spectroscopically in a solution suitable to commercial requirements, the

colour of an unknown derivative of the compound in question may be

foretold from its spectrum with tolerable accuracy.

A Study of the Absorption Spectra of Isatin, Carbostyril, and their Alhjl

     Derivatives in relation to Tautomerism. (Hartley and Dobbie.) ^

     The examination of absorption spectra has recently been successfully
applied to the study of the relationship between compounds commonly
described as tautomeric and desmotropic. In those cases, for example, in
which a substance and two related isomeric alkyl compounds having
respectively the lactam and the lactim constitution are known, it is un-
certain whether the supposed parent substance has a constitution similar
to that of either of the derivatives. Thus there are two methyl deriva-
tives of isatin, the constitution of each of which has been satisfactorily
determined from its chemical reactions, but there is no unquestionable
evidence which proves that the constitution of isatin itself is similar to

that of either of the derivatives.

     It is known that the substitution of a methyl or ethyl group for an
atom of hydrogen, without other alteration in the structure of the sub-

stance, merely increases the general absorption very slightly for each CHo

added to the molecule,^ that is, it slightly shortens the transmitted
spectrum, but makes practically no ditlerence in the character of the
absorption ; for instance, it scarcely increases its intensity, nor does it
convert a general absorption into one that is selective, or vice versa.

      The curves of molecular absorption of such substances afford the

 desired information concerning the relationship of their constitution to
that of their respective derivatives.

      The spectra of carbostyril and methylpseudocarbostyril both show an
absorption band in the same position, and the spectra of the two sub-

stances are in other respects almost identical, the only difference being that
the general absorption is slightly increased in the case of methyl- and

ethylpseudocarbostyril, which is the effect usually produced when

     Complete absorption of all rays beyond ' /\ 2700 until we arrive at a

dilution of 1 milligram-molecule of the substance in 500 c.c. of liquid

with 5 mm. of thickness, when the rays extend to 2770.
     At 3 mm. thickness an absorption band becomes visible, which extends

to 1 milligram-molecule in 2500 c.c, and 1 mm. thickness of liquid.
     At 2 milligram thickness at 1 in 500 c.c. it lies between i/X 2900 and

3300, the rays are transmitted then to ^/X 3500, after which there is
total absorption. The transmission of the continuous spectrum extends
to ^ jk 4000 beyond the absorption band, which has almost disappeared

at 1 milligram-molecule in 2500 c.c. at 2 mm, thickness.

that of carbostyril, the general absorption being slightly increased, which is

what is usual when methyl takes the place of hydrogen or CH2 is added

    At 2 mm. and 1 mm. the absorption of rays less refrangible than ^X

weakened.

there is nothing transmitted beyond ^ jX 3030, except the very strong line

to 4 mm. of 1 milligram-molecule in 2,500 c.c, when the rays between ^ [X

transmission of strong rays beyond lying between ^/A 4250 and 4400, and

so gradually the absorption diminishes.

With 1 milligram -molecule in 100 c.c. there is a total absorption of

At 5 mm. there is a very feeble transmission of rays between ^/X

At 3 mm. it is evident that a very strong absorption band lies between

3470 being totally absorbed.

This absoi'ption band gradually diminishes in intensity, but more rapidly

on the part of the rays of shorter wave-length than is the case with those

lying between ^X 2270 and 2870. For instance, 2 mm. of liquid con-

taining 1 milligram-molecule in 500 c.c, absorbs the rays between ^/X

2600 and 2770. Total absorption is seen beyond 3600.

      Thompson.

The progress in the teaching of science in elementary schools which was

noted in the last report of your Committee has been more than main-
tained in so far as the number of scholars receiving instruction is con-
cerned. The following table, made up from the return issued by the
Education Department, gives the figures for the scientific class subjects,
and for English by way of comparison. It will be remembered that
for the eight years preceding the Code of 1890, English was obligatory as
a class subject if any such subject was taken in the school. The placing
it merely on a level with the other subjects had the effect of reducing the
number of departments in which English was taken from 20,304 in
1889-90 to 19,825 in 1890-91, while in the same years the number of
departments taking Elementary Science rose from the almost nominal
figure of 32 to 173. The table shows the progress from that time
onwards. It will be observed that there is an extraordinary increase in
Object Lessons, which it was pointed out last year would be the case
owing to the giving of Object Lessons in the three lower standards being
made obligatory after September 1, 1896. The full efiect of this change
has hardly yet appeared. The return for 1897-98 should show a figure
almost equal to the total number of departments. This ascendency of
Object Lessons is fully capable of explaining the decrease in Elementary
Science, and does not necessarily involve any lessening of the child's
knowledge of Nature. It is rather a question of nomenclature than any-
thing else, in some schools the object lessons course in the lower standards

     The number of departments in ' schools for older scholars ' for the
year 1897-98 was 23,043, all but two of which took one or more class
subjects. But History was taken in .5,780 departments, and needlework
(as a class subject for girls) in 7,252 departments, and sundry minor

subjects in 972, making, with the other four subjects of the table, a total

of 68,534. This shows an average of very nearly three class subjects to
each department, but it must be borne in mind that the same subject is
not always taken in all the standards, in which case three or more class

subjects will appear in the return for a single department.

     It has been previously remarked that 'the increased teaching

of scientific specific subjects in the higher standards is the natural

consequence of the greater attention paid to natural science in the lower

part of the schools.' The following table shows that such is the actual

Department, and the preferences of managers and teachers, the Evening
Continuation classes are to a great extent regulated by the public local
demand, which rather seems to be for a continuation of the studies which
have been begun in the Elementary Schools than for those practical
subjects which are specially provided for by the Technical Instruction

Act.

     The London School Board have just passed a series of resolutions on
the subject of the teaching of science in their schools, and amongst others
that ' Experimental Science instruction was desirable for girls as well as

--for boys : ' that ' scholars of about Standard IV. should have an oppor-

tunity of doing some practical work themselves, such as linear (or other)

--measurement : ' and that ' where some definite science is taught in the

upper part of the school, the teaching of Experimental Science in the lower
part of the school should lead up to it.' The extension of the teaching of
Science in the Board Schools has necessitated the Science demonstrators
giving more and more attention to the preparing of the ordinary teachers
for giving practical instruction in Science in their classes. These teachers
have usually obtained certificates for one or more sciences under the
Science and Art Department, but that does not necessarily qualify for the
practical teaching of science according to modern views. Hence the need
of the preparation above referred to. It would seem desirable that only

those teachers who have some interest in, or aptness for, experimental
work should be selected for this kind of training, and after having become

thus qualitied, they should be assigned, as far as possible, to this par-

ticular work. To carry this out more thoroughly the Board have decided
' that Experimental Science classes for teachers be started under the Board
in the autumn,' and ' that there be courses of Pedagogical Lectures to
secure the practical teaching of Elementary Science, confined to teachers
who have reached a certain standard of scientific knowledge of the subject
on which the lectures are given.'

      It is to be hoped that under the newly constituted Education Depart-
ment far more attention will be given than heretofore to improving the
conditions under which science is taught in schools. Especially is it im-
portant that attention should be paid to the practical training of pupil
teachers in the elements of scientific method. The time given to such

work is altogether inadequate at present. But in some ways too much

is often attempted, and from this point of view your Committee think it
 desirable to recall attention to the recommendations in the last paragraph
of their Report for 1897, as up to the present time no action has been taken
 by the Education Department.

--Iftomeric Napldhalene Derived ivcfi. Ttepnrt of tlic Committee, considinq

 The experiments on the etheriiication of betanaphthol and its derivatives,

 referred to in the previous report, have been continued by Mr. Davis, the
 formation of methylic and propylic ethers having also been investigated.

       Methylic, ethylic, and propylic alcohols have an almost identical effect.
      The results are of interest in comparison with those obtained by V.

 Meyer and others in the case of carboxylic acids. IMeyer, it is well

known, has shown that a single gi'oup, in a position contiguous to the acid
radicle, has little influence on the limit of etheritication, and only affects
the rate of change : but this is not true of betanaphthol, as 1 chloro-

betanaphthol yields only about 10 per cent, of ether, although betanaph-
thol gives over 90 per cent, and nitronaphthol cannot be etherified.

     The eflfect is, in a measure, the reciprocal of that referred to in Sections
10 and 13 of a ' Synopsis for a Discussion on Laws of Substitution, especially
in Benzenoid Compounds,' printed later in this volume. The first act
in the formation of an ether is probably the association of the group
which becomes etherified with the etherifying agent ; but the attractive
power of the phenolic oxygen is much affected by changes in the radicle
with which it is associated, and consequently both the rate and limit of
etherification are modified by every change in the hydrocarbon radicle.
Probably the carbonyl oxygen in acids plays a part similar to that here
pictured as played by the hydroxylic oxygen in naphthol.

     But it is not improbable that the nucleus also plays a part in etheri-

--fication, especially as betanaphthol in which the nucleus is obviously less

--saturated than is the nucleus in phenol yields so much larger a proportion

of ether than does phenol. Under the most favourable conditions phenol
affords at best about 25 per cent, of ether when digested with alcohol and

sulphuric acid.

     (Drawn up by the Secretary.)

During the past year (1898-9) the work of this Committee has been
continued, and a large number of wool and silk patterns, dyed with
various natural and artificial violet and ffvey colouring matters, have been
examined with respect to their power of resisting the fading action of

light.

     The general method of preparing the dyed patterns, and the manner
of exposing them under glass, with free access of air and moisture, were
the same as already adopted in previous yeai's.

     The thanks of the Committee are again due to Edward A. Hirst, Esq.,

in whose grounds the patterns were exposed, at Adel, near Leeds.
     Each dyed pattern was divided into six pieces, one of which was pro-

tected from the action of light, while the others were exposed for different
periods of time. TJiese ' periods of exposure ' were made equivalent to those
adopted in previous years by exposing, along with the pattern, special
series of ' standards,' dyed with the same colouring matters as were then
selected for this purpose. The standards were allowed to fade to the
same extent as those which marked off the ' fading period ' in previous
years before being removed, or before removing a set of dyed patterns
from the action of light. The patterns exposed during the past year are
therefore comparable, in respect of the amount of fading action to which
they have been submitted, with the dyes already reported upon.

     The patterns were all put out for exposure on March 12, 1898, certain

sets being subsequently removed on the following dates : April 20, May

 28, June 27, October 22, 1898 ; April 25, 1899. Of these five 'periods of
--364 REPORT 1899.

exposure' thus marked off, periods 1, 2, 3 were equivalent to each other
in fading power, whereas periods 4 and 5 were equivalent to four of the
iirst period in this I'espect ; hence five patterns of each colour have been
submitted respectively to an amount of fading equal to 1, 2, 3, 7, and 11
times that of the first ' fading pei'iod ' selected, viz. March 12 to April

20, 1898.

     The dyed and faded patterns have been entered in pattern-card books
in such a manner that they can be readily compared with each other.

     The following tables give the general result of the exposure experi-
ments made during tlie year 1898-9, the colours being divided, according
to their behaviour towards light, into the following five classes : Very

fugitive, fugitive, moderately fast, fast, very fast.
     The initial numbers refer to the order of the patterns in the pattern

books. The S. and J. numbers refer to Schultz and Julius's 'Tabel-

larische Uebersicht der kiinstlichen organischen Farbstoffen' (3rd edit.

1897).

                 Class I. Very Fugitive Colours, (Wool.)
    Many of the colours of this class have faded so rapidly that at the end

of the first ' fading period ' (March 12 to April 20, 1898) only a very faint
colour remains, and at the end of the fifth period (one year) all traces of
the original colour have disappeared, the Avoollen cloth being either white

or of a yellowish or greyish appearance.

                                                       SiJk Patterns,

     INIost of the foregoing colours were also dyed on silk, and the patterns
were exposed to light along with those on wool. The relative fastness of
the colours was for the most part the same as on wool, the differences
observed being too unimportant to warrant a special classification for

silk.

                                       Concluding Observations.

    These experiments on the Action of Light on Dyed Colours have been

continuously in progress from 1892 to 1899, during which period over
10,600 dyed patterns have been exposed to light, representing about 900

colouring matters, including nearly all those at present in use.

     The foUowino- tables give a resume of the relative fastness to light or
all the colours examined, arranged in order of shade and according to

their chemical constitution.

The Committee report that the work during the past twelve months lias
been proceeding on the same lines as before. The reports from the
specialists to whom the Eccup collection has been referred are not yet

complete. Reports on special districts have been received from Dr.
Wheelton Hind and Mr. G. H. Morton ; the latter hopes to report more
fully later on. These reports are appended. The recent evidence

obtained does not seem to afford any assistance in the selection of zone
fossils capable of being used outside the special districts to which they

were first found aj^plicable. Thus, Chonetes papiUionacea, a species charac-
teristic of the Lower Scar Limestone of Westmoreland and Yorkshire, has
recently been reported by Dr. Hind from the Upper part of the Carboni-
ferous Limestone of the Congleton district in Cheshire ; while Mr. Morton

finds that several common species, previously considered to be characteristic

of the upper and middle subdivisions of the Carboniferous Limestone in the
west of the country, occur in Anglesey and along the Menai Strait in

the lower division.

     Owing to constant absence from England, Mr. Garwood has with
regret been obliged to resign the office of Secretary to the Committee. The
Committee are, however, glad to state that Dr. Wheelton Hind has under-
taken to transact the business of the Committee in future, if they are

re-appointed.

     The Committee have been unable to carry out any further exploration
during the year, and have therefore not drawn any of the money granted
by the Association at the last meeting.

372 REPORT-- 1899.

   --The Coal Measures. With regard to the sequence of coal medsufes

in the various districts, I would refer to my schemes with the horizons at
which the molluscs occur, printed in Part II. of my monograph on the

British Carboiticola, Anthracomya and Naiadites.

     The species of the genus Anthracomya seem to me particularly useful

in each coalfield as denoting zones wliich I have more particularly worked
out in the North Staffordshire coalfield, the upper coal measures con-
sisting of red measures with sandstones, ironstones, a few corals and spirorbis
limestones. The latter are, however, found almost to the base of the
North Staffordshire coalfield. The typical shell of the lower part of this
series is Anthracomya Phillipsii, which passes down to the Knowles Iron-
stone, below which it is not found. In the North Staffordshire and
Manchester coalfields, a small shell, Anthracomya calcifera (Hind), appears
to denote a zone some 300 yards above the zone of A. Phillipsii. In the
North Staffordshire coalfield this zone occurs just below the Penkhull
sandstone, hitherto mapped as Permian by the Geological Survey.

     Anthracomya minima is typical of the Knowles Ironstone.
     Anthracomya Adamsii and A. 2>ulcra, confined to the Burnwood or
Little Mine Ironstone.
     Carhonicola turgida, typical of a bed a few yards above the moss

coal.

     Carhonicola nttcularis, C. cuneiformis, Anthracomya Williamsoni,
A. suhcentralis, only found in roof of Hardmine coal.

     Carhonicola similis is found only about the horizon of the Cockshead

coal.

     The genus Naiadites comes in with the Knowles seam, and is found at
several horizons below this to the base of the Coal Measures.

     The gannister series appears to be absent in North Staffordshire, unless
it is represented by thin beds with Aviculopecten papyraceus about the
Stinking Coal, Cheadle and Froghall, and over the lower coals of Wetley

Moor.

    The Hutton cannel seam of Wigan is characterised by a bivalve like a

Schizodus (the Tellinomya of H. Bolton), probably unfilled casts of
Carhonicola turgida, and the Arley mine by Carhonicola rohusta.

     The Millstone Grit series appears destitute of molluscan remains, the
beds thin out to the south-west, only two remaining along the west flank

of the Pottery coalfield.

     Four important marine bands occur in the North Staffordshire coal-
field, one high up over the Bay mine, with

Aviculopecten, sp.          Macrocheilus

ON LIFE-ZONES IN THE BRITISH CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS.              573

     One over the Moss coal, with Lingida mytiloides.
     One over the four-foot Wetley Moor coal with Lingiola mytiloides and

compressed goniatites
     Below the Millstone Grits occurs a series of shales with gannistef-

like sandstones said to be 3,000 feet thick, an estimate which I con-

sider much too large, for the beds are much i-olled, and form a series
of anti- and synclinals from east to west, and wherever there appears to
be a direct sequence from limestone to the grits there is never room for
more than about 1,000 feet of Measures. Below this gritty bed are a

series of shales with bullions and thin earthy limestones.
      These beds are characterised by a curious fauna which seems to have

lived on till the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire were laid down. The

fauna comprises several forms of goniatites.
      Glyphioceras Phillipsii, G. micronotum, G. vesica, G. implicatum,

 G. plaiylobum, G. stenolohum, G. nitidum, G. reticulafum, G. JDavisi,
 G. diadema, Dimorphoceras Gilbertsoni, D. discrepans, Gasfriosceras car-

honarium, G. Listeri, Nautilus, Orthor.eras, Nuctdana stdla, Schizo-
dus antiquus, Posidoniella Icevis, P. Kirkmani, P. varians, Avicidopecten
papyraceus. Gastropoda of several genera also occur.

     Messrs. Barnes and Holroyd, who have for some years watched the
tunnel driven by the London and North-Western Railway under Pule
Hill, Marsden, have made a fine collection from the bullions contained in

the shales. These are evidently on the same horizon as the shales of
High Greenwood, Cumsworthdean, near Todmorden, from which localities
long lists are given in Davis and Lees's ' West Yorkshire.' I have detected
the same bullions with fossils near Dane Bridge, Cheshiie, and the

Coombes Leek, Staffordshire, and am of opinion that this bed occurs not

far below the Shale or Pendle Grit ; and I believe it to be the representa-
tive of the Pendle Limestone as found on Pendle Hill.

     At Congleton Edge, Cheshire, which is nearly 1,000 feet high, there

is a complete sequence from the first bed of millstone grit to the limestone
massif. This range of the escarpment of this hill is formed by millstone
grit ; two beds, the first and third, with a few feet of intervening shale

occur. Some 200 yards below this is a quarry, at the base of which

are beds of hard, gannister-like quartzose sandstone with plant remains,

which may be the representative of the shale grit. These are suc-
ceeded with laminated black shale crammed with compressed goniatites,

Posidoniella Irevis and P. Kirk-inaiti. Above these are 10 to 20 feet of
grey marl with layers of calcareous bullions, in which the following fauna

occurs :

     The fauna found in the excavations for a reservoir at Eccup, near Leeds,
contains numerous species identical with those found at Congleton Edge.

    Messrs. Barnes and Holroyd drew my attention this year to a bed of

--grit on the east flank of Pule Hill, Marsden, filled with fossils chiefly

casts. The number of specimens is large but the variety small, and

including :

Goniatites, sp.                     Sedgivivkia attenuata
Pleurotomaria, sp.                  Schizodns antiqiins
Betteroplwn, sp,                    Myalina Verneuillii.
Lingula, sp.
                                            ,, Flemingi.

     Nowhere in the district do limestones of any thickness occur between
the limestone ' massif ' below and the base of the Millstone Grit which
corresponds to the Yoredale series ; and I consider that there ai'e no
grounds for assuming that the beds of shale and sandstone which occur in
this position in the South Pennine area are in any way the equivalents of

the Yoredale series of Wensleydale.

   --The Mountain Limestone. Since Messrs. Barnes and Holroyd drew

my attention to the occurrence at Castleton of beds of rolled shells, and

limestone pebbles with occasional quartz pebbles, which occupy the highest
portions of the ' massif ' of Mountain Limestone, and which they interpret
as contemporaneous limestone beach, I, with Mr. A. Howe, have traced
this bed over North Staffordshire, Cheshire, and Derbyshire, wherever the

upper beds are exposed. It seems to have been laid down as a shore which
retreated from north to south, before the shales were laid down upon it.
Various shells occur in this beach. Chonetes j^apilionacea, and Producti,
StropJtomena aiialoga, trilobites and many teeth of Psammodus, Psepliodus,
and other fish I'emains, which are very similar to those of the main limestone
Leyburn. Below this bed come highly fossiliferous beds of corals, molluscs,
with others of encrinital origin. Below still come a series of limestones with
narrow bands of chert and beds of encrinites, and finally hard, thick-bedded

limestones with sparse fossils.

      All the celebrated fossiliferous localities of Derbyshire and Stafford-
 shire occur at the top of the limestone massif, where all the species occur
together in the same bed. Most of the fossils are semi-rolled, and very
few lamellibranchs have both valves in contact, and I doubt if they arc
 in the place where the animals died. Elsewhere in the series fossil
moUusca are rare.

     I am unable to find any fossils distinctive of zones in the limestone

 of this area, with perhaps one exception, and that local. Prodnctus liume-

rosus characterises the Cauldon Low beds, but is not found elsewliere.

These beds I consider to come near the top of the massive beds of limestone.

     It is the intention of Mr. Howe and myself to publish a paper of

 details on the occurrence of the conglomerate beds and the carboniferous
sequence in this area in the near future, for which we are now gathering

statistics.

  --Note on Nucula gibbosa. This shell comes in the Calciferous Sand-

stone beds of Fife, and ranges through the Carboniferous Limestone Series
of Scotland. Occurs in abundance in the Redesdale ironstone ; is not met
with, pace the compilers of lists, in the Carboniferous Limestone, but
occurs in the shales below the Millstone Grits, and in the true Coal

--Measures of North Staffordshire.
     Note on Loivick Fossils. Mr. John Dunn, of Redesdale, has collected
a very large percentage of the species listed for Lowick in a bed of lime-
stone at the Combs, Redesdale, which is the four-laws limestone, from its

relation to the four-laws coal.

  11. Bejyort on Carboniferous Roclcs and Fossils ; North Wales District.

     Mr. G. H. Morton reports that he has in preparation a list of the
fossils found in the carboniferous limestone of North Wales. It contains

--the result of collections made in four separate areas, viz. Llangollen,

Flintshire, the Vale of Clwyd, and Anglesey. The list shows the range

of the species in the subdivisions of the formation in each of the four areas,

not mei-ely by an asterisk, but by letters indicating the relative frequency
and rarity of the species.

     The list has been completed, with the exception of the part relating to
Anglesey, but another year will be necessary to finish that area. Collecting
in Anglesey and along the Menai Strait has already shown that several
common species, previously considered to be characteristic of the Upper
and Middle subdivisions of the carboniferous limestone occur there in the

lower subdivision. It appears that the occurrence of species in definite
horizons depends more on the lithological character of the strata than on
the horizon at which they occur.

    As the collecting in Anglesey will be finished early next year, it is

obviously desirable to postpone the presentation of the list until it can be
given in its final form.

 III. Eejjort on Carboniferous Bocks and Fossils ; Isle of Man District.

   --Mr. Lamplugh writes concerning the Isle of Man : ' In the prepara-

tion of the Survey memoir of that area, several collections of Manx

carboniferous fossils have been examined by the Palfeontologists of the
Geological Survey, and a substantial list of fossils has been compiled,

which it is hoped may be of service in correlating the carboniferous rocks
of the island with those of the mainland. As a result of this work it is

found that there are well-marked variations in the fauna of different

parts of the limestone, as the Rev. J. G. Gumming pointed out fifty years

ago, but the zonal value of these variations is somewhat doubtful, as the
changes seem to indicate differences in the physical condition of sedi-
mentation, rather than the dying out of species, and the evolution of
others. The collections examined were the labelled portion of the

Gumming collection of King William's College, Castletown, Miss Briley's

collection, Mr. R. Law's collection, Dr. Hind's collection, and the col-

lections of the Woodwardian Museum and of the Geological Survey.'

    The Committee hope to make use of these lists, and to refer to them
more fully in a future report.
376 REPORT-- 1899.

Mh --Irish
Remains. Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor

W. Boyd Dawkins {Ghairmmi}^ His Honour Deemster Gill,

Eev. Canon Savage, Mr. G. W. Lamplugh, and Mr. P. M. C.

Kermode (Secretary), appointed to examine the Conditions under

ivhich Remains of the Irish Elk are found in the Isle of Man.

As soon as possible after our reappointment last September we commenced

excavating at the Loughanruy in Ballaugh, where, as stated in our first
Report (1897), the Edinburgh specimen was found in 1819.

    We reached the undisturbed white marl at a depth of 9 feet, and

penetrated through it at 18 feet, uncovering an area of about 12 yards
by 2, in a line parallel with and about 6 feet north of the boundary hedge
where the original example had been discovered. Unfortunately the
weather broke, and though we had shored up our trench with timber the

water burst through and prevented further work.

     Samples were forwarded to Mr. James Bennie, who again kindly

assisted the Committee by preparing the material.

     Mr. Clement E,eid examined and reported on the remains thus
obtained. The plants, as he points out, include singularly few species,
and there is no trace of dry soil species among them. In the silt, the
large number of leaves all belonging to a single species of willow suggests
that we are dealing with a poverty-stricken flora, such as might occupy
the island soon after the ice had passed away, and before there had been

time for many plants to be introduced.
     The question whether the megaceros marl may not show a mUder

climate than the succeeding deposit must still remain an open one. All
the plants in the marl have an exceedingly wide range, both northern and
southern, and there is nothing in any way characteristic except the
fragments belonging to Lepidurus (ajius) glacialis. Mr. Reid, however,

 fairly points out that this is only a single specimen, and, the species being
abundant in the overlying bed with Arctic Willows, it would not be safe

--to found much on it a light thing of this sort might so easily fall in

and be taken out with the lower bed.

   --The species found were :

Silt {Bed C of our Jirst Report).

Lepidurus glacialis (abundant).      Salix herbacea (abundant).
Ranunculus aquatilis.                Carex.

            Marl {F ofJirst Report).

Lepidurus glacialis (one fragment).  Empetrum nigrum.
                                     Potamogeton uatans.
Ranunculus aquatilis.
         ,, flammula.                                             1 sp.

         ,, repens.                  Carex.
Littorella lacustris.

    No trees are found in either deposit, and this circumstance, perhaps,

shows that a mild climate did not exist during the deposition of the marl.

--Photogra2)hs of Geological Interest in the United Kingdom. Tenth

     Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor James Geikie
     (Chairman), Professor T. G. Bonney, Dr. Tempest Anderson,
     Mr. J. E. Bedford, Mr. H. Coates, Mr. C. V. Crook, Mr. E. J.
     Garwood, Mr. J. G. Goodchild, Mr. William Gray, Mr.
     Egbert Kidston, Mr. A. S. Eeid, Mr. J. J. H. Teall, Mr.

     E. H. Tiddeman, Mr. H. B. Woodward, Mr. F. Woolnough,

    ami Professor W. W. Watts (Secretary). (Drawn up by the

       Secretanj.)

The Committee have the honour to report that during the year 324 new-

photographs have been received, bringing the total number in the collec-

tion to 2,325. The average yearly income during the decade has thus

been 233.

In addition to this 61 pi'ints and 6 slides have been given to the

duplicate collection, making a total of 391 photographs received during

the year. About forty are already in hand for next year.

Thirteen old prints have also been renewed by the kindness of Mr.

Gray, Mr. Eaton, Mr. Stelfox and Mr. Welch.

The usual scheme showing the geographical disti-ibution of photographs

--is appended. The following counties are now represented for the lirst

time : Bedford, Buckingham, Hereford, Berwick, Linlithgow, Kerry, and

Tipperary. The following counties are more richly represented than

--hitherto : Devon, Northumberland, Stafford, Suffolk, Warwick, Radnor,

Fife, Inverness, and Mayo.

Several of the donations are of exceptional interest. Mr. A. S. Reid

has carried out a photographic survey of the Island of Eigg, and has

already presented to the collection 27 enlarged photographs, to illus-

trate the Scuir of Eigg and its remarkable history as told by Sir

Archibald Geikie. The set includes photographs of the pitchstone of the
Scuir, the river gravel underneath it, and many other phenomena of

volcanic and tectonic interest in the island. He has also given a set of

prints which will be circulated with the duplicate collection as a model of

a local survey.

Another connected series illustrating the physical history of the

Yorkshire rivers is communicated by Mr. Godfrey Bingley, who took the

photographs at the suggestion of Mr. Kendall. The series is not yet

finislied, but it is already a most useful and instructive one, and bids fair

to become very valuable as a record of ancient physical changes, while it

admirably illustrates the value of photographic records for this purpose.

Besides this set Mr. Bingley has contributed other photographs from

Yorkshire and Lancashire, and Mr. Cuttriss gives further examples of his

photographs of caves.

To Mr. A. K. Coomara Swamy the Committee are indebted for a largo

series of prints taken mainly during excursions made by the Geologists'

Association into Scotland, Devon, Dorset, Kent, Gloucestershire, and else-

where                         volcanic  phenomena,  unconformities, denudation, weathering,
                           ;

contortion, and the position of important rock zones, are all illustrated by

this series. Mr. H. C. McNeill also gives other photographs taken on

excursions of the Geologists' Association and described in the Proceedings

of that body.
--378 REPORT 1899.
ON PHOTOGRAPHS OF GEOLOGICAL INTEREST.  379
380 REPORT--1899.

The representatives of the late W. Topley have presented 19 photo-

graphs taken on the rivers Elan and Claerwen on the site of the new
ABirmingham waterworks.
                         most useful account of the geological featui'es

of these photographs has been communicated by Mr. H. Lapworth, the

chief authority on the geology of the district.

     Mr. J. A. Cunningham has illustrated photographically the contorted

Carboniferous Limestones of the Loughshinny district, near Dublin, some

of which have been rendered classic by the Memoirs of the Geological

Survey of Ireland.

   --Amongst other sets the following should be especially mentioned : The

Ingleton district by Mr. F. N. Eaton, the Devonshire coast by Miss Part-

ridge, the Purbeck, Portland, and Lower Greensand Strata in Buckingham-

shire by Mr. Pledge, and a series of dykes in Down by Miss Andrews.

     To the donors and others above mentioned and to the following, the

--Committee are much indebted : Miss Silverston, Mr. R. McF. Mure,

Mr. J. H. Baldock, Mr. A. Watkins and Mr. H. Cecil Moore, Mr. E. J.

Garwood, Mr. K. F. Bishop, Mr. W. G. Orme, Mr. W. Wickham King,
Mr. W. Gray, Mr. Stelfox, and Mr. G. Nichols.

    There is still much room for work in the Pennine Chain, especially its

western side, the Weald, the Cotswolds and Edge Hills, North and South

"Wales, the Yorkshire Moors and Wolds, the Malverns, the Oxford and

Cambridge districts, Cornwall, the Southern Uplands and the Highlands

of Scotland, and in central and southern Ireland.

    Notices of the woi'k of the Committee have appeared in many periodi-

cals and journals, and an article was published in 'Science W^ork' illus-

trated by a beautiful reproduction of one of Mr. Reid's photographs of the

Scuir of Eigg.

The photographs received during the year have been mounted and will

be exhibited at Dover, after which they will be bound up and deposited

with the rest of the collection at 28 Jermyn Street, where they may

always be referred to on application to the Librarian. The collection is

arranged geographically in twenty-seven albums under the heads of

Acounties, and their natural topographical divisions.  catalogue arranged

under counties is kept in the Library for reference, and the card catalogue

is maintained up to date as new photographs are received.

The numbers of six old lost photographs, which it has not been possible

to recover, have been finally cancelled and some of this year's prints and

one renewal have been inserted in their place ; such numbers are those on
List I., between 2 and 302, and a separate list (II.) of the cancelled

photographs is given.

     Certain corrections in former lists have been kindly made by Mr.

Welch, to whom the thanks of the Committee are due. These are placed

in List III., in which are also placed 13 photographs renewed by Mr.

Gray, Mr. Eaton, Mr. Welch, and Mr. Stelfox.

    Many geologists, British and foreign, have expressed a desire to

possess examples of geological photographs which they have seen in the

collection. The Committee are willing to undertake the publication of a

small experimental series if a guarantee fund can be formed as a safeguard

against loss.

The publication would take the form of the issue of about twenty

photographs in platinotype or carbon, or high-class process reproductions,

accompanied by descriptive letterpress. If the subscribers preferred,

lantern slides might be issued instead of prints or in addition to them,
         ON PBOTOGRAPgS OF GEOLOGICAL INTEREST.  :J8l

     The duplicate coUectiott has been sent, entire or ill part, to the follow-

--ing local societies : The Manchester Geological Society ; the Hertford-

shire Natural History Society ; The Essex Field Club ; the Scientific
Society of the Birmingham and Midland Institute ; the Vesey Club,
Sutton Coldfield ; the Croydon Microscopical Society ; and the South-
Eastern Union of Natural History Societies.

The additions to this collection during the year are given in List IV.

61 prints and 6 slides have been x-eceived, and the whole collec-

Ation now numbers 324 prints and 101 slides.  list of donors to this

collection is appended to List IV., and to each of them the Committee

express their thanks.

It has been found desirable to admit to this collection photographs

illustrative of such geological phenomena as do not occur in England, oi-

are more typically represented abroad. Thus Mr. Coomara Swamy has

contributed a set of photograplis of volcanic phenomena from the

Auvergne and the Eifel ; Professor Hutton one of earth-pyramids in New

Zealand ; while the collection already contained photographs of earth-
pyramids from Botzen, and one of the false bedding in the face of the

Sphinx.

Applications by local societies for tjie loan of this collection should

be made to the Secretary. Either prints or slides, or both, can be lent,

with a descriptive account of the slides. The carriage, and the making

good of any damage to slides or prints, are borne by the borrowing society.

         TENTH LIST OF GEOLOGICAL PHOTOGKAPHS

                       (TO July 30, 1899).

   --Note. This list contains the geological photographs which have

 been received by the Secretary of the Committee since the publication

 of the last Report. Photographers are asked to affix the registered

 numbers, as given below, to their negatives for convenience of future

 reference. Tlieir own numbers are added, in the same order, to enable

' them to do so.

      Copies of jDhotographs desired can, in most instances, be obtained
 from the photographer direct, or from the officers of the Local Society
 under whose auspices the views were taken.

     The price at which copies may be obtained depends on the size of the

 print and on local circumstances over which the Committee have no control.
      The Committee do not assume the copyright of any pliotograpilis

 included in this list. Inquiries respecting photographs, and applications
 for permission to reproduce them, should be addressed to the photographers

direct.

The very best photographs lose half their utility, and all their value

as documentary evidence, unless accurately described ; and the Secretary
would be grateful if, whenever possible, such explanatory details as can

be given were written on the forms supplied for the ]5urpose, and not on

the back of the photograph or elseivhere. Much labour and error of tran-

Ascription would thereby be saved.      local number by which the print

can be recognised should be written on the back of the photograph and on

the top right-hand corner of the form.

Copies of photographs should be sant immounted to W. W. Watts,
--;382 REPoM 1899,

Mason University College, Birmingham, and forms may be obtained from

him.

    The size of photographs is indicated as follows :--

         L = Lantern size.                                  1/1= Whole plate.
                                                         10/8 = 10 inches by 8.
        1/4 - Quarter-plate.                            12/10 = 12 inches by 10, &c.
        1/2 = Half -plate.
                                E signifies Enlargements.

* indicates that photographs and slides may be purchased from the donors, or the

address given with the series.

--Erratic Blocks of the British Isles. Report of the Committee, consist-

     ing of Professor E. Hull (Chairman); Mr. P. F. Kendall
    (Secretary), Professor T. G. BoNNEY, Mr. C. E. De Rance, Pro-
    fessor W. J. Sollas, Mr. E. H. Tiddeman, Rev. S. N. Harrison,
     Mr. J. HoRNE, Mr. F. M. Burton, Mr. J. Lomas, Mr. A. R.
    DwERRYHOUSE, Mr. J. W. Stather, and Mr. W. T. Tucker,

       ajjpointecl to investigate the Erratic Blochs of the British Isles,

     and to taJce measures for their p'eservation. (Drawn up hij the

        Secreta/ry.)

The attention of the Committee has been concentrated mainly upon the

erratics of Yorkshire, and they have again to acknowledge the great
services rendered by the Yorkshire Boulder Committee, and the sub-
sidiary organisation working on the eastern side of the county under the
auspices of the Hull Geological Society.

      Of the value of their work it would be difficult to speak too highly,
especially when it is borne in mind that it is not a new-born zeal which
animates the workers, but that year by year they have devoted themselves
to the task, and now enter upon the second decade.

     The most noteworthy new facts relate to the dispersal of erratics of
Scandinavian origin, which have now been traced over a much wider area
and to much greater altitudes than previously ; moreover, the distribution
of type sets of rocks from the east coast of Norway amongst the active
workers has given them a firmer basis upon which to work, and several of
the rocks have now been recognised in the drift of Yorkshire.

     The new records of Scandinavian rocks enlarge our knowledge of their
dispersal in two important particulars : their horizontal range has been
much extended, and they liavc been traced to altitudes far exceeding that
previously ascribed to them. The discovery of Norwegian rocks to the
westward of the Chalk Wolds announced in the report presented last year
has been supplemented by two new records at Brantingham Thorp and

Elloughton respectively.

     The well-known Rhomb-porphyry has been found by Mr. J. W.

Stather at Speeton at an altitude of 400 feet above Ordnance Datum, by
Messrs. Kendall and MufF at altitudes exceeding 600 feet at several points
 on the northern slopes of the Cleveland Hills, but the greatest height to
which this rock has been traced in Britain is indicated by Mr. Stather's
discovery of a specimen embedded in Boulderclay at 810 feet Ordnance

Datum on West Rigg in the Lockwood Hills.
      Some interesting facts have been brought to light on the Cleveland

 Hills, where Messrs. Kendall and MufF have found that at high altitudes
 there is a significant absence of the rocks which belong to the Teesdale

 dispersion, such as Shap granite, Brockram, and Whin sill, while all Car-

 boniferous rocks are exceedingly rare ; while, on the other hand, Magnesian

 Limestone of a type which appears to be restricted to the coast of Durham

 is very abundant in association with a profusion of porphyrites from the
 Cheviots, and occasional flints, Scandinavian rocks and shell fragments.

    An important aid to the elucidation of the origin of the erratics of the

  --Note. Following a suggestion in the Holderness memoir, we have

become accustomed to regard Denmark as the source of the pink flints,
common in the Boulder-clays of Holderness. This proves to be erroneous.

Mr. A. Jesson, of the Danish Geological Survey, recently informed the
Secretary (Mr. Stather) that pink flints do not occur in either th«.

Cretaceous rocks or tlie Drifts of Denmark, and are quite unknown there.

      Ossiferous Caves at Uphill, near Weston-super-Mare.

The Committee report that a large cave was opened and explored for
Asome distance, but being unproductive was abandoned.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  second cave

was opened, and has been traced for a distance of 23 feet, when it opens

upon a rock ledge somewhat similar in character to a rock shelter.
    Fragments of mammalian bones, gnawed bones, hammer stones, and

pot-boilers have been found, together with the long bones of birds and

small mammals, which from their shape would seem to have been used as

pins or borers.

    At 7 feet from the entrance of the second cave a piece of black Roman

pottery was found. The material shows abundant traces of water action,
and would seem to have been carried from the rock shelter into the cave,
and to have also come from higher levels, a search for which is now being

made

§ I. 1888. In the 'Memoirs of the GeoJogical Survey of JSTew South
Wales, Paleontology,' No. I. pp. 1-8, and plate 1, figs. 1-10, Robert
Ethei-idge, junior, treating of the Invertebrate Fauna of the Hawkesbury-

Wianametta Series of New South Wales, describes and figures some

EsthericE obtained by deep borings in those strata, namely at the Moore-
park, Port-Hacking, Dent's Creek, Heathcote, Narrabeen, and Moorbank

Bores.

      Estlieria Coghlani, Cox, first described in the ' Proceedings of the

Linnean Society of New South Wales for 1880 (1881),' vol. v. p. 276, is

here figured in plate 1, figs. 1-5 (from Dent's Creek Bore) ; and some
undetermined fragments, figs. 6, 8-10, from the same and from the Narra-
been Bore.

  --§ II. 1895-6. In his memoir on the stratigraphic and faunal rela-

tions of the Oneonta sandstones and shales, the Ithaca and the Portage

groups in Central New York, from the ' Fifteenth Annual Report of the

State Geologist,' Mr. J. M. Clarke describes, at pp. j63-81, some sections
in Chenango, Courtland, Schuyler, and Yates Counties. At Station VI.,
De Ruyter, Madison County (pp. 68 and 69), above the Tully Limestone
come the Sherburne Sands, and herein were found three specimens of an
interesting species of Rhinocaris, which Mr. Clarke names hvpeymis.
Though not perfectly preserved, they show a low curved ridge on the
valve, an optic and a mandibular node, three external abdominal segments,
and caudal appendage. In one of the specimens a valve has Ijeen
weathered away and exposes some obscure evidences of internal organi-

sation.

     § III. 1897.--In the ' Thirteenth Report on the Palteozoic Phyllopoda

('Report Brit. Assoc, for 1897,' pp. 343-346) reference was made at pages
343 and 344 to some of Dr. G. F. Matthew's minute Cambrian fossils

from New Brunswick. In a letter dated November 5, 1897, he directs

attention to ' Leperdilla ' as misspelt for Lepidilla, and having no con-

nection with Leperditia, but meaning ' double scale,' being bivalved. He

adds ; ' I wish to withdraw Lepidilla, as not being a crustacean. More

                                                                                                       DD2
--404 REPORT 1899.

perfect specimens seem to show a fanlike structure of internal tubes.

There is only one species, the one you mention.' He adds : ' I have

referred Ceratiocaris ^yusilla to Rhinocaris (see "Seventh Report," p. 64,
and " Thirteenth Report," p. 344) as being the nearest genus, but it appears
to have a fixed rostrum (attached to one valve), though possibly the suture

may run through from the apex of the shield.'

      $ IV. 1897.--In the 'Geological Magazine,' Dec. IV. vol. iv. (1897),
pp. 197 and 198, a new genus of Paljeozoic Phyllopods was recognised as
Estheriina in the Cardinia Freysteni, Geinitz, and the Estheria liinbata,
Goldenberg ; the distinctive features having been determined by the study
of some Brazilian forms (of Cretaceous ? age). Ibid. pp. 198 and 201.
These have the umbonal area of each valve extremely exaggerated, the
remainder being thin, flat, and marked with more numerous and more

delicate concentric lines.

    A Permian specimen, from Frankfurt-on-the-Maine (described and

figured in the 'Geological Magazine,' September 1899, p. 394, pi. 15,
fig. 7), found by Baron von Reinach, represents a highly swollen separate
umbonal area (such as occurs isolated with those in Brazil), and has been

named Estheriina extuberata, Jones.

     § V. 1898.--Mr. J. M. Clarke, State Geologist of New York, in the

 ' Fifteenth Annual Report of the State Geologist,' gave a series of ' Notes

on some Crustaceans from the Chemung Group of New York State,' and

 therein described and figured (pp. 731-733, two figures) a singularly
 ornamented Phyllocarid Crustacean, found in the Chemung Sandstone at

 Alfred, N.Y. It is related to Echiiwcaris, but, besides other diflTerences,
 it has a deep oblique sulcus on the valves, and these are fringed with long

 strong spines. Its name, Pephricaris horripilata, has reference to its

 extravagant decoration.

   --§ VI. 1899. M. Canavari, in the ' Proc. Verb. Soc. Toscana Sci. Nat.

 Pisa,' 1899, pp. 150-153, noting the occurrence of Silurian Entomostraca
 in Sardinia, mentions some Osiracoda, such as Beyrichia reticulata,
 Bornemann, B. simjdex, Jones, Entomis migrans and dimidiata, Barrande,
 and some undescribed species ; also Cypridina and Bolbozoe. Of the
 Phyllopoda he mentions fragments of Ceratiocaris and Aristozoe, and

 several specimens of Apityclwpsis prima, Barrande.

       § VII. 1899.--Dr. G. F. Matthew, in his 'Prehminary Notice of the

 Etcheminian Fauna of Newfoundland ' (' Bull. Soc. Nat. Hist. New

 Brunswick,' XVIII. vol. iv. p. 189), describes and figures single valves
 of the minute Aptychopsis Terranovica, p. 194, pi. 3, fig. 5, and its ' muta-

  tion' arcuata, p. 195, pi. 3, fig. 6.

       § VIII. 1899.--In the 'Monograph of Dithyrocaris ' (' Palseont. Soc.'),
 part iv. p. 183, we have determined that the Devonian valve from Saal-

  feld, pi. 22, fig. 2, is a Calyptocaris, not a Chcenocaris as at first placed,
  p. 133 ; also in the 'Fourteenth Report,'. 1899, p. 521 ; and that it is

  allied to Calyptocaris striata from the Lower Carboniferous Sandstone of

  Scotland.

    --§ IX. 1899. 1. Two Lower Silurian specimens from Brittany, in M.

  Paul Lebesconte's collection at Rennes, were mentioned in the ' Seventh
  Report on Paleozoic Phyllopoda,' ' Report Brit. Assoc, for 1889 (1890),'
  p. 65. These, although pressed and distorted in the slaty schist, are
  certainly allied to, though not identical with, Dithyrocaris, and are

 evidently the oldest examples of the group. On the back of one of the

  specimens a single but damaged valve supports our determination of their
          ON THE FOSSIL PHYLLOPODA OF THE PALAEOZOIC ROCKS. 405

characters and alliance. On one or other of these three individuals there

are characteristic anterior and posterior denticules or spines, and longi-

tudinal ridges and foldings, such as are common in the group. Combining

the evidences given by these specimens, although somewhat oljscure on

account of imperfections, distortion, and imbedment, we conclude that
they are the relics of a bivalved Phyllopod, and we name it Lebescontia
ceniginatica, J. and W.

     2. Subsequently from among the Carboniferous fossils of Linn Dairy,
collected by Mr. John Smith, of Kilwinning, we have seen two counter-

parts of one valve, corresponding in general characters with Lehescoidia.

It is figured and described by Jones and Woodward in the Monograph of

Palieoz. Phyllop. Pal. Soc, for 1899, as L. occulta.

   --§ X. 1899. Related to Cyclus, which is a Phyllopod, a new genus

Hihhertia has been established by Jones and Woodward, on a specimen
long ago collected from the Lower Carboniferous series at Burdiehouse,
Scotland. This has a nearly circular shield- like test, with a slight kink
or crumple in front, and a concave hollow behind, about as wide as a third
of the test. This indentation lies between the postero-ventral angles of
the shield ; and the median space above it is occupied by the obscured
debris of the animal. The outer edge of the test shows an upturned
narrow rim ; and the sides of the buckler are much tuberculated, includ-
ing the inner edges of its incurved posterior angles. Faint traces of some

probably articulate limbs are discernible. It is concluded that this little
fossil is related to Cyclus, but characteristic of a distinct genus, which is

named Hibhertia, after Dr. Hibbert, whose discoveries in the Carboniferous
strata at Burdiehouse are well known. 'Geol. Mag.,' September 1899,

p. 390, pi. 15, fig. 4.

   XL --§ 1899. One of the two specimens of the rare JEchinocaris

Whidbornei recorded in the ' Thirteenth Report,' p. 346, is figured and

During the past year only one list of type specimens of British fossils has

been published, namely, Mr. Bather's List of the Blastoidea in the British
Museum. This is the second list of types issued by the Trustees of the
British Museum, the Fossil Cephalopoda having been similarly treated in
1898. The list of type specimens in the Brodie Collection, prepared for
the Committee by the late Rev. P. B. Brodie himself, has been lent to the

Department of Geology, British Museum, and has been found of much
value in identifying these fossils, which are now incorporated in the

National Collection.

406 REPORT-- 1899.

--Ty Newydd Caves. Report of a Gommittee consisting of Dr. II.

     Hicks {Chairman), Eev. Gr. C. H. Pollex, S.J. {Secretary), Mi-.
     A. Strahax, Mr. E. T. Newton, Mr. G. H. LIortox, and Rev.
    E. R. Hull. S.J., appointed to investigate the Ty Newydd Caves,

    Tremeirchion, Xorth Wales. (Drawn up by the Secretary.)

In addition to those mentioned in former reports on this exploration ' as
having given us assistance, we have to acknowledge the kindness of Mr.
D. L. Paterson, of Aston Pai'k, Birmingham, and of Mrs. tSutton, of
Market Drayton, who gave us permission to excavate on their property,
and of Mr. John Griffiths, of Mold.

     The principal work done during the past winter and spring has been

     (1) In the eastern cave.                                of
     (2) In the northern portion of tlie western cave.

   A(3) trial shaft was also sunk in a cave 200 yards S.-W.

Ty Newydd, on the same hillside.

     (1) The eastern cave consists of a true cave tunnel with oval section,
and a rock floor measuring, on the average, 8 ft. by 5 ft. in cross section,
and extending 35 ft. at one level in the direction N. and S.

    At the northern extremity there is a passage to the W. 8 ft. long and

6 to 8 ft. across, connecting it with an oval chamber 23 ft. by 8 ft. and
18 ft. to 24 ft. high. The entrance is situated in the upper portion of
this chamber on the western side.

     This cave has an outlet at its southei*n extremity, when it turns
sharply to the N.-E. with a sudden dip of nearly 45°, which prevented

further excavation.

     At the top of tlie first chamber from the entrance there were some

small beds of gravel, which are described and figured in the ' Q.J.G.S.'
February 1898, p. 124. The lower part of this chamber, as well as the
passage and tunnel beyond, was tilled almost exclusively with laminated
sandy clay, containing a few fragments of stalagmite. It is not there-

fore considered necessary to repi'oduce in this report any of the measured
sections taken in this part of the work.

     (2) The northern portion of the western cave runs in the direction of
the gully separating these caves from those of Ffynnon Beuno and Cae
Gwyn.

      After passing across the old quarry floor behind the cottage of

Ty Newydd, the cave runs under a garden on the northern slope of the hill.
     For 6 ft. we found here a roof of rock, but beyond that distance there

was only a fissure covered by boulder clay.
     As "sve oljtained permission to explore this part of the cave on con-

dition of our doing no permanent injury to the surface, we endeavoured

as far as possible to tunnel under the drift, which, however, proved a very
unsafe roof to our excavations.

     To the distance of 33 ft. the average width of the axxe was 2 ft. to

     ' Q.J.G.S. FebruaiT 1S9S, p. 119. Report read at the Bristol Meeting cf the
British Association, 18'jy. Not published.
          ON THE TY NEWYDD CAVES.             407

3 ft., but at this point it widened out and divided into two passages, one

3 ft. to 4 ft. wide, continuing due N., the other 1 ft. to 2 ft., turning 30°

to the E.

   We followed each of these passages for some distance, but they gradu-

ally became filled with large blocks of limestone ; and as we found that one

very large block formed a continuous floor 13 ft. below the surface, which

would have prevented our exploring at a lower level, we thought it best

to abandon this part of the work, and to sink a shaft at 25 ft. from the

quarry entrance. This shaft was carried to a depth of 25 ft. from the
surface, when the boulder clay above began to fall in, owing to the heavy
rains in January. The expense required to shore up the roof and to make
further working safe would have been very great, so we were reluctantly

obliged to fill in all this part of the cave to prevent any further sub-

sidence.

The material excavated consisted chiefly of clayey gravel, containing

Asome sand, and also some stalagmite.  sample sent to Mr. Strahan for

examination was found to contain striated stones. There was also some

stalagmite adhering to the walls. As we passed to a lower level the

sand disappeared, and the gravel became undistinguishable from the lowest

clayey gravel found in former portions of the cave, but we could not

clearly determine the line which separated the deposits. There were also

a few thin beds of clay in the upper gravel.

These deposits had been cut through vertically in several places, and

large beds of sand and of laminated sandy clay had been introduced. In

one case the division between the gravel and the sand beds was concave.

    At the 25-ft. shaft there was a funnel-shaped bed of sand which

           _

thinned off below into a long pipe with cross sections 1 ft. by 3 in. This

extended nearly the whole depth of the shaft and then turned towards

the N.

      Besides having to abandon this part of the work without fully deter-
 mining the con-elations of the beds, we were also under the disadvantage

of not knowing what the deposits may have been in the upper portion of
the cave in the old quarry, and are thus unable to make out the exact

connection between the northern and southern parts of the western cave
 with each other and with the eastern cave.

      Twenty-two feet beyond our furthest work under the garden there is
a cutting in the hillside to provide a level space on which some cottages
have been ei'ected. In the courtyard behind these cottages, after re-
moving modern debris, we found a fissure cave, considerably wider than
the former western cave fissure, being 4 to 5 ft. across. The direction in
this part was nearly E. and W., but there were indications that it subse-
quently turned in a northerly direction. The undisturbed material con-

sisted of a very deep bed of laminated clayey sand, containing large
blocks of limestone and massive stalagmite fragments, one of the latter
measuring over 18 in. in thickness. Below this there was a bed of gravel
which had apparently been introduced from a small fissure, 1 ft. G in.
wide, which runs in the direction of our former workings. Just opposite

tliis fissure the gravel was at its highest level, and the dip to the N.-W.
was so great that we thought it useless to excavate far, as there was no
promise of a mouth by which animals could have entered the cave.

     There was no true roof of rocks, but the sides were composed of a
limestone breccia, with blocks of several tons weight, so that the exca-
vation was a work of no little difficulty and danger. In the heavy rains
                           ----

--408 REPORT 1899.

of the early spring the work became too perilous, and we were obliged to

refill the cave before a serious fall could take place.

     (3) At a distance of 200 yaixls from Ty Newydd cave, on the same
hillside, a trial pit had been made for lead about sixty years ago. The

miners passed through 14 ft. of rock, and then came to an open cave,

which they did not disturb. On removing the debris which filled this pit
we found an open chamber 20 ft. by 12 ft., and 8 ft. high in the centre.
From this chamber a tunnel, about 3 ft. wide, ran S., and another small
passage 1 ft. wide extended W. ; both of these were filled to the roof at a

distance of 12 ft. and 5 ft. respectively from the chamber. The pit was
over the extreme northern end of the chamber. Immediately under this
opening in the rock we sank a shaft 14 ft. deep to the rock floor, and

obtained the following succession :

      Sand, 4 ft., the surface rising a foot more in the chamber.

     Laminated sandy clay, 6 ft., with many large blocks of limestone, and

fragments of massive stalagmite, with stalactites 8 in. to 1 ft. in diameter.
      Clayey sand, 4 ft.

     There was no trace of gravel, nor could we see any indications of a
natural outlet to the surface. The laminre of the middle bed "dipped to
the N., showing that the cave continued in this direction.

General Summary of Results.

    As this is the final I'eport on the excavations, it will be convenient to
give a general summary of the work done, and of the conclusions at which
we have arrived.^

     The excavation was commenced on December 23, 1896, and termi-

nated May 6, 1899.

     The following grants have been obtained towards the expenses :

Royal Society Donation .     .  . . . . £15.

Government Grant Fund, 1897     .... 20.
                                .... 30.
,, 1898
                                . ... .40.
British Association, 1898    .

     In addition to these grants further sums have been obtained from

private sources.

     About 1,300 tons of material have been excavated, and as most of the
exploration has been below the surface, the material was usually wound up
in buckets and deposited at a higher level. All the original excavation
of the caves has been done by the theological students of St. Beuno's
College, although for a great part of the time one or two workmen have
been employed to remove the debris.

     The general direction of the cave fissures in this neighbourhood, in-
cluding those of Ffynnon Beuno and Cae Gwyn, is N. and S. In the last
two caves only have natural mouths been discovered, and they are conse-
quently the only ones in which there are traces of occupation by animals
and man.

     In the longest portion excavated, the western cave, Ty Newydd, which

     ' Papers frequently alluded to in thisEeport are : Dr. Hicks's reports on Ffynnon

Beuno and Cae Gwyn caves, 1884, Proc. Geol. Assoc. 1 ; Q.J.G.S. 1886, p. 3,

This last paper refers to other publications on Ffynnon Beuno and Cae Gwyn

caves.

was explored for a distance of over 300 ft., no floor has been reached,

although in some places 30 to 40 ft. vertical depth has been attained, and

the total diflerence of level between the highest and lowest points is

74 ft. From the materials excavated we have obtained the following

succession, commencing with the lowest deposit.

  --A. Purely local gravel. Of the stones in this gravel Mr. Strahan

writes : ' All have come from the immediate neighbourhood of Ty

Newydd, and the proportion of silurian rocks suggests that the cave

either leads to the silurian boundary underground, or was supplied by a

stream running over these rocks and falling into a swallow-hole when it

passed on to the limestone.' In this deposit we found our only two

fossils, both waterworn fragments of molars, horse and rhinoceros sp.,

evidently introduced as pebbles with the gravel. These fossils show that

the hills above the caves could at this time support large mammalia.

   We could find no distinction between this material and the gravels

from below the bone beds in Ffynnon Beuno and Cae Gwyn caves, ^ of

which Dr. Hicks says : - ' The lowest deposits, consisting almost entirely of

local materials, must have been introduced by a river ' . . . He also
writes in a recent letter : 'A critical examination, such as you have since

made, did not seem at that time necessary, but the importance of the

difference between this and the disturbed materials in the cave was at

Weonce recognised.  certainly had not discovered non-local stones, but it

was thought better to qualify the expression until the gravel had been

more thoroughly examined, especially as bits of quartz and sand grains

may or may not have had a local origin. The pebbles examined were all

from local sources.' In the western cave, Ty Newydd, this gravel had

nearly filled the southern portions of the cave to the height of 4-50 ft.

O.D.

    B. On the floor formed by this gravel the bone beds of Ffynnon Beuno
and Cae Gwyn were found. Although at the time of their discovery the

majority of the fossils were no longer in their original positions,

Dr. Hicks was able to show that a massive stalagmite floor had formed

over them.^ In one part of Ffynnon Beuno cave this floor was found

Aintact, with the bones adhering to its lower surface."*  floor was also

discovered in Ty Newydd cave, in contact with the earliest gravel, and

presumably both were formed during the same period of rest.

   --C. Stalagmite floor. In Ffynnon Beuno and Cae Gwyn this stalag-

mite attained a thickness of 10 inches to 12 inches, while in Ty Newydd

we found a floor, in situ, extending for nearly 70 feet, and varying in

thickness from 18 inches to over 3 feet. For the most part this floor was

massive or with thin sandy partings. The northern portion, however,

was in thin layers alternating with sand, showing that some of the latter

considerable quantities of sand and with the underlying local gravel.
Whether the floor at Ffynnon Beuno was similarly broken through we
cannot now tell, but the floods cannot have been very severe, as so small

a portion of the Ty Newydd floor was taken away. Mr. A. Strahan

detected some striated stones in the gravel belonging to this part of the

series, thus indicating the presence of glacial conditions.

    E. All these earlier beds in Ty Newydd were covered over by a thin

bed of clay, which, although of no importance in itself, was of great use
in providing us with a clear line of separation between the various
formations. Above this clay bed, in the southern and middle portions of
Ty Newydd, we found a deep deposit of limestone breccia in clay which

reached nearly to the surface. In each place where this was present we

also observed that the roof was wanting, and the abrupt termination of
the cave walls implied that they formerly extended some feet higher
before arching over. The removal of the roof must have been subsequent
to the formation of the stalagmite, as it is absent over nearly the whole

length of the floor.

     The breccia was so compact that in several places it was difficult to

distinguish it from rotten portions of the cave wall. Many of the blocks

were over 2 cwt., and in no case was the appearance of the bed such as to
imply a simple falling in of the roof, but it rather indicated that con-
siderable force had been applied.

     This powerful agent appears to have been identical with the force

which disturbed the bone beds of Ffynnon Beuno and Cae Gwyn, breaking
up the floor and redepositing the fragments with the fossils in a clay

matrix.^

     F. The succession hitherto discussed is chiefly founded on the deposits

in the southern half of Ty Newydd western caA'e. The laminated sandy

clay or clayey sand which followed was very poorly represented at the
higher levels of this cave, but in the lower northern portion, in the eastern
cave, and in the last excavation made under the old lead shaft this deposit
was found in great abundance. Its true place in the succession is proved
by the excavations at Cae Gwyn,'^ where it completely covers over the

redeposited bone beds.

     To this deposit we must add the sandy beds with marine shells dis-

covered at the northern extremity of Cae Gwyn cave.^

     G. Over all the deposits in the caves, and in several places in direct

contact with them, there is spread over the valley a considerable thickness
of boulder clay, containing the only local stones which have glacial striae,

and also having a large admixture of erratics.'*
     The above correlation, though only put forward as a suggestion, yet

cannot be denied some probability, especially when it is remembered
that only a few hundred feet separate all the excavations, and therefore
the same agents must have been at work on each.

--Canadian Pleistocem Flora and Fauna. Report of the Committee,

    consisting of Sir J. W. Dawson (Chairman), Professor D. P.
    Penhallow, Dr. Ami, Mr. G. W. Lamplugh, and Professor A. P.

     Coleman (Secretary), reaj^jiointed to continue the investigation of

     the Canadian Pleistocene Flora and Fauna.

In last year's report of this Committee the results obtained from excava-

tions in the Don Valley, Toronto, and from three wells or shafts sunk at

or near the foot of Scarborough Heights, east of the city, were given in
some detail. The Scarborough shafts were intended to determine whether

the warm climate beds of the Don Valley underlie the cold climate beds

of Scarborough, and whether the whole series is interglacial ; and the
results of the work done made it very probable that both questions should
be answered in the affirmative. But the coming in of water from Lake
Ontario put a stop to the work before solid rock (Hudson shale of the
Cambro- Silurian) was reached, and so prevented the positive proofs desired.

     As it was of great interest either to prove finally or to disprove the
interglacial character of the great series of beds referred to, the sum of
30/. was granted at the Bristol meeting to carry the work farther, if
possible to a conclusion. At the desire of the Chairman of the Committee,

5/. of the grant were devoted to the examination (jf Pleistocene beds of
the Ottawa Valley, the work to be reported on by Dr. Ami. 25/. were
therefore available for work near Toronto, and more than this amount has
been expended in the sinking of shafts intended to settle the questions

referred to above.

     As last year's work had been rendered unsatisfactory thi'ough the
incoming of water, it was decided to choose a new point for work near
the river Don, where it was known that the Hudson shale rises above the
river, so that good drainage might be looked for. It was also known
that the Don beds are well shown in this region, since they are admirably

exposed at Taylor's brickyard ; but at the latter point the Scarborough
clays, cold climate beds, are only doubtfully found to a thickness of from

8 to 13 feet. As characteristic Scarborough peaty clay had been traced

at points some distance north of the biickyard, it was decided to begin a
412 REPORT-- 1899.

shaft at a point one-third of a mile to the north-east, ·where the conditions

appeared favourable.

The place chosen is on the plain or terrace formed by ancient Lake

Iroquois, with a deep ravine on each side, the one to the east cut by the

Don, that to the west by a small tributary stream. The terrace rises

148 feet above the Don, which is here 12 feet above Lake Ontario as

determined by aneroid, and Hudson shale crops out 30 feet above the

river, leaving a thickness of 118 feet of ' drift' above it. Near the top of

the steep slope above the Don an excavation made for obtaining potter's

clay exposed about 40 feet of stratiiied bluish-grey clay, containing no
peat or other fossils probably of later age than the fossiliferous inter-

-- --glacial beds making it unnecessary to commence the shaft at the top of

the terrace.

The first shaft sunk on the slope towards the Don was unsuccessful,

since at a depth of 17 feet water began to come in from a stratum of sand,

putting an end to the work. The upper part of this shaft passed through

grey clay, but the last 2 feet consisted of clay with boulders.

As another shaft started 100 yards to the south proved no better, it was

decided to begin anew on the opposite side of the hill, an eighth of a mile

to the west, on the slope towards the small tributary stream.

The third shaft was commenced 35 feet below the Iroquois terrace,

and in the absence of the Secretary was taken in charge by Professor

A. B. Willmott. He reports that sand was passed through for 32 ^ feet,

followed by 2^ feet of gravel and a foot or two of clay, the whole depth

being 38 feet. Here, however, water came in so rapidly that the work

was stopped. No undoubted boulder clay was met with, though at

12 feet depth large Archaean boulders were found in the sand. Below this

some layers of sand and gravel cemented with carbonate of lime occur, and

in gravel beneath the cemented layers unios and pleuroceras wei'e found,

unfortunately too fragmentary to be determined.

Professor Willmott decided to sink another shaft lower down the

hill, at a point apparently better drained, and this was successfully carried

down 60^ feet, almost reaching the Hudson shale, the Secretary once

more taking charge of the work.

The section disclosed 13 feet of sand and gravel like those of the

previous shaft, but with no cemented layers and no shells ; 30^ feet of
stratified clay, with some wood, peaty layers, and hard thin sheets of

greenish clay ironstone                                                                                                      2^ feet of brown sand with some clay ;  5 feet  of
                                                                                                                          ;

bluish sand and clay ; 6 inches of gravel with unios ; 2 feet of brown

sand and about 6^ feet of blue sand, and a little clay containing many

shells. At this depth water put a stop to the work. By the side of the

stream a few paces away a small scarp exposed the Hudson shale a foot

or two below the bottom of the adjoining shaft, and resting on it was a

sheet of typical boulder clay, from 6 to 18 inches thick, containing frag-

ments of limestone and Archaean rocks, such as granite.

The section opened up by this shaft displayed characteristic Scar-

borough peaty clay overlying equally characteristic Don sands with unios,

the lower boulder clay lying beneath the latter, but the upper boulder

clay was not shown. To settle its position a fifth shaft was sunk just at

the foot of the cutting for potter's clay near the Don, Professor Willmott

again taking charge of the operations. He reports that the shaft,

commencing 42 feet below the Iroquois terrace, goes through 13 feet of

surface soil and stratified grey clay without fossils. At 15 feet boulder
        ----

clay was met on the side towards the river, with numerous small ano-ular

pebbles of shale and an occasional one of syenite. At 16 feet stratified
clay with some pebbles of shale replaced the boulder clay, going down

5 feet, M'hen boulder clay again came in to the thickness of 2^ feet and of
typical character, containing boulders of limestone and granite. Below
this a little stratified clay was found, and then sand until the shaft was
stopped at a depth of 27 feet.

    An opening made on the hillside below showed about 6 feet of sand

followed by 10 or 12 feet of gravel overlying stratified peaty clay. This
shaft gives evidence that the upper boulder clay overlies tlie strati-
fied sand and also the peaty clay as at Scarborough Heights, and so com-

pletes the proof that the cold climate beds and the underlying Don beds,
with unios, leaves, and wood of a warm climate, lie between sheets of till,

and are interglacial.

    Summing up the work done, we have the following section near the

tributary stream :

     It is found that the top of the peaty clay is about 15 feet lower on

the side of the hill towards the Don than on the western side near the

tributary; but on both sides it is covered with interglacial sand and
gravel as at Scarborough Heights, the latter point being unknown before

the shafts here described had been sunk.

     The thanks of the Committee are due to Professor A. B. Willmott for
taking charge of the work during the absence of the Secretary, and to the
Messrs. Taylor for their kindness in permitting the shafts to be sunk on

their property.

   A considerable amount of material, such as fossil leaves and wood

obtained during the work and from Taylor's brickyard, has been forwarded
to Professor Penhallow for identification, but time has been wanting for

evidence as to the great series of interglacial beds commonly called the

  --I^itroduction. In August, 1898, it became known that what is perhaps

the clearest and most instructive section in the famous high-level drift
deposits at Moel Tryfaen must in a short time be swept away in the course
of the quarrying operations. There are two slate quarries on Moel Tryfaen,
the ' Alexandra ' and the ' Moel Tryfaen ' quarries, excavated in the same
line of strike of the slates. Gradually expanding, they had approached
each other so nearly as to leave a narrow bank between them with no more

than a yard or two of uncut turf upon it. Now the drift sections thus in

1. They are at right angles to the strike of the slates, and thus display
the character of the underlying rock surface. 2. They show the nature
and position of the junction of the shelly sands and gravels with the over-
lying boulder clay. 3. The false bedding and other structures in the sands

and gravels are best seen along them. 4. They have been more accessible
Athan the other sections in the quarries.
                                           Committee was therefore

appointed to preserve, by photography, supplemented by a written report,

an impartial record of the phenomena displayed in these sections. The

Committee have much pleasure in acknowledging their obligations to Mr.

Menzies, the manager of the Alexandra Quarry, who, with a large-minded

appreciation of scientific work for which geologists cannot be too grateful,

offered to suspend operations in that part of the quarry for three months,

besides showing the Committee every hospitality and facilitating their work

by all means in his power.

  --Photograiohs. Six whole-plate and five half-plate photographs were

taken by Mr. John Wickens, F.R.P.S., photographer, of Bangor.

The views taken are :

    1. General view of section from W.N.W. end.

     2. General view of section from E.S.E. end.

    3. General view from W.N.W. of Moel Tryfaen Quarry, including

  --Description of Section. The Chairman, Dr. Hicks, visited the section

on September 26, 1898 ; and on November 5, 1898, Messrs. Kendall, Lamp-
lugh, Lomas, Mellard Reade, Shone, and the Secretary examined it and
recorded the facts embodied in this report. On July 1, 1899, the Secretary
added items 1, 2, and 9.

    As there has been serious difference of opinion as to the interpre-

tation of the Moel Tryfaen phenomena, the Committee wish to emphasise

the statement that this report is intended to be a record of observed

facts only, without reference to any conclusions that may be drawn from

these facts.

     The observations are here arranged under thirteen heads. All the
details were examined from the side of the Alexandra Quarry, which was
the better and more accessible section of the two.

   --1. Bearing and Distance of Section from Hill-top. About 800 ft.

E.S.E. to the middle of the section.

  --2. Length of Section.--From 700 to 750 ft.

     3. Direction of Section. The sections are in curves concave to N.N.E.
and S.S.W. in the ' Alexandra ' and ' Moel Tryfaen ' Quarries respectively,
so that a tangent to both curves at their nearest point, about the middle

of each section, is about W.N.W. -E.S.E.

   --4. Height of Bock Surface. The floor of Gallery 'No. 1,' the highest

in the Alexandra Quarry, is at 1,281 ft. above sea level. The surface of
the rock emerges from below drift in the floor of this gallery a few yards

towards hill-top (Photographs 1, 2, 3, 4, 11). The sections which will

--remain at present will show the varying thicknesses in the quai-ries.
      8. Genercd Nature of the Drifts. Their general characters have been

with shells, boulder clay coming on above them towards the S.E.

   --10. Character of the Sandy Group. The beds may be described as

 sand and yellow loam with gravelly streaks and pockets containing shells.
 The shell fragments were found on November 5 only in the gravel, none but
 the finest crumbs having' been seen in the sand and loam (o, p. 419). The
 bedding is very irregular, and even here and there curved (Photograph 1),
 but contortion has only been observed near the junction with the over-

--lying boulder clay (/3, p. 419).
       11. Characters of the Boidder Clay. This is a good, typical, tough,
 strong, unstratified till, such as is mostly found in mountain districts,
 dark grey in colour and full of stones (Photograph 4). The stones
 are for the most part of moderate size, but some up to 3^ and 3 ft. (the
 visible part) occur. They are subangular and well striated. There seems
 to be a general slight upward inclination of the longer axes of the stones
 to E.S.E. or E. The longer axis of the large boulder mentioned pointed

 W. 20 S.-E. 20 K, and its eastern end was a little lifted. Nearly all

 the stones observed were of N. "Welsh origin, the riebeckite eurite of

 Mynydd Mawr being very abundant, but one pebble of a granite foreign to

remain, in which all points not depending upon orientation can be observed.

   --12. Nature of Junction of Sandy Group and Boulder Clay (Photo-

graphs 5, 6). In a general way the sandy group passes under the boulder
clay to the E.S.E., as described by previous writers. The sandy beds in

places dip W. at the junction, and are also contorted, a string of loamy

sand two inches thick being bent into sharp folds (fig. 2). These con-
tortions,' however, were not very clearly displayed on November 5 on
account of slipping.

     The boulder clay rests upon an uneven surface of the sandy beds, as
shown in the annexed section (fig. 3), which was measured, and is drawn

to scale.

    'The photograph No. 5 is taken close to the E.8.E. end of this section.
The boulder clay is ' good typical stony till,' and the underlying beds the
usual sand and yellow loam with gravelly streaks and pockets containing
shell fragments. In the lowest layers are angular fragments of slate,

below which is broken slate mixed with a small quantity of clayey matter

resting on slate with terminal curvature.

     Evidence has been adduced by previous writers to show that the sandy
group overlies as well as underlies the boulder clay, so that the two groups

interdigitate. The section as seen on November 5 could not be said to be

conclusive on this point; but it is shown in Photograph No. 6, of which fig. 4

is an explanatory diagram : (a) is very stony boulder clay, stones mainly of

with angular ends projecting from the clay into the sand, the largest being

apparently of Penmaenmawr diorite, and the other two of riebeckite eurite

of Mynydd Mawr. There is no distinct evidence that the shelly sand and
Agravel anywhere overlie the boulder clay.
                                                            close examination showed a

distinct line, probably of erosion, between that which passes above and that

which passes beneath the boulder clay, in which last only were shell frag-

ments found. The sand and gravel above the boulder clay may be altogether

   --13. Base of the Drifts and Nature of Underlying Rock Surface

(Photographs 7, 8). The surface of the slate is seen in contact with the
sandy group only, the boulder clay not reposing directly upon the rock in
any part of the section. The surface of the slates is exceecUngly shattered,
the shattering affecting them to the depth of a foot or two. The shattered
edges are, with (ci, p. 419) certain local exceptions, bent over in an E.S.E.
direction, i.e. to the left of an observer looking along the strike of the

cleavage to the S.S.W., the displaced laminae retaining generally their

original direction of strike. The displacement usually goes down to the

first horizontal joint below the surface, and is a ' displacement ' rather
than a true curvature.

      These terminally disturbed slates pass up into a band of slate breccia
or rubble, composed of angular fragments (e, p. 419). This forms a well-
marked band all along the section, and is from 1 to 3 ft. thick. The

             --Fig. 4. N.W. Termination of Boulder Clay in Section.

 fragments become smaller towards the top, and have at first a slight
 inclination upwards to the E.S.E. , the upper layers, however, becoming

 horizontal. Where not obscured by slipping, the junction with the sandy

  drift above is usually well marked, but angular and subangular debris is
  mixed with the lowest layers of the gravel.

    --Conclusion. The above description is not intended to be exhaustive,

  though the description of the section about to be destroyed has been made

  as full as seemed possible at the time. Incidentally certain details in
  other parts of the quarries were observed, and have therefore been included ;
  but these form only a subsidiary and unessential portion of the report, and
  are therefore placed in a separate appendix (see Appendix C), because the
  sections in which they are displayed are in no danger of destruction.
  Generally, moreover, it will be observed that the report is confined to
  questions of structure, physical relations, and measurements ; and that

  many matters of the highest importance, such as species, distribution, and

  state of preservation of the shells, the nature of the boulders in the sands
  and the clay, the character of the fine material of the drifts, are not dealt
                                                                                   '

with. These are points which can be investigated as well as ever in

extensive sections, which the quarrying will keep clear and open.

It must not be supposed that the Moel Tryfaen sections are bein"'

destroyed as a whole.       It is  the part specified only that is                       perishing                                 and

the drifts of the quarries will continue to furnish ample scope for research
into many matters of great importance to glacial geology for many years

to come.

          Notes by Chairman and Members.

   --(a) §10. Some of the best preserved specimens sent to me by Mr.

Menzies from the drift in the Alexandra Quarry have adherin" to them a
fine loamy sand, and it is in such a material, iuterstratified with sand and

gravels, that I have usually obtained the best specimens of shells in the
Welsh sections. (H. H.)

(/3) §10.-- In addition to boulders of North Welsh rocks, they are full

--of far-travelled erratics from the Lake District and the South of Scotland.
     (y) §11- This deposit, therefore, differs widely in regard to its

included stones from the underlying sandy group, which contains many

far-travelled erratics, as  before  stated                           as  it  does  also  in  the  apparent
                                                                  ;

     (8) §1.3. P. F. Kendall and J. Lomas would prefer to say that the

general direction of displacement had only a few individual exceptions,

--which might indeed be due to quarrying operations.
     (e) §13. This material was not observed by the Committee to contain
any glacially striated fragments or any foreign stones--no fragments,

indeed, but of the underlying slates.

                          By T. Mellard Reade, F.G.S.

     Specimens of the drift were taken Ijy me at the meeting on November ^
1898, in the jwsitions shown on the following sections (figs. 5 and 6) and

submitted to Mr. Joseph Wright, F.G.S., of Belfast.

    He very kindly examined them for Foraminifera, and in all discovered

twenty-three species. The results seem to show that the Foraminifera occur
in the most abundance in the shelly sand. None were found in the overlyin"-
boulder clay (Specimen 4), and a few only in Specimens Nos. 1 and 2. In
No. 3 the Foraminifera were more plentiful and of species common to the

low-level boulder clay of Lancashire, Cheshire, and the Vale of Clwyd. As

usual, yonionina depressula was common, and far outnumbered the

other species.

     The high-level drift generally does not appear to have been searched
much for Foraminifera. The only other published list from Moel Tryfaen
that I can find is that given by Miss Mary K. Andrews.

--Pedigree Stock Records. Report of the Committee, consisting of Francis

      Galton, B.G.L., F.R.S. (Chairman), Professor E. B. Poulton,

     F.R.S., and Professor W. F. R. Weldon, F.R.S. (Secretary),

      appointed to promote the Systematic Collection of Photographic and
      other Records of Pedigree Stoch. (Prawn iip by the Chairman.)

Inquiries made on behalf of the Commivtee have fully justified the belief

that led to its appointment, namely, that few exact records exist of even
the nearer ancestry of the members of any descriptidn of Pedigree Stock.

The 7iames of all their ancestry for many -past generations are published

in Stud-books, Herd-books, and other similar works, but. in other respects
those works afford scant means for obtaining that distinct presentment of
each of the nearer ancestry which is needed for an exact study of the Art
of Breeding. The information as to feature and form in the books men-
tioned above is almost wholly confined to colour, and, in the case of horses

only, to height at the withers. Many details relating to appearance and

action are, however, scattered over the pages of various volumes and
periodicals, but these would require an excessive amount of labour in
research before any complete families could be properly worked through

for even three generations. As regards photographs, those of the
more celebrated animals are now published in one form or another

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

nevertheless, it has been found very difficult to obtain the photographs of
even a few of those genealogical triads, consisting of an adult subject, its
sire, and its dam, which form the primary molecules of every pedigree.

The authorities who were consulted on thoroughbred horses and on purely

bred shorthorn cattle, were hardly able to indicate a single case in which
photographs exist of all the seven individuals--the. adult subject, its two

--parents, and its four grandparents which form the secondary molecules

of a pedigree. Thus the admirable opportunities enjoyed by breeders for
making systematic records that would afford a solid basis for the advance-
ment of the art of breeding, have been hitherto most inadequately utilised.
The reason is not far to seek. Heredity is a comparatively new science,
and few persons are as yet acquainted with the character of the records
most suitable for its study, or are sufficiently impressed with the need
for their exactness and persistence. The most important of those
records which it seems feasible to obtain are photographs, not merely
pretty and well worked-up productions satisfactory to an artistic eye, but
rather such as are analogous to the portraits made of criminals, for
storage at the central police office, to serve as future means of identifica-
tion. The desired photographs need to be taken under Such conditions as
shall ensure their being comparable under equal terms, and shall admit of
the accurate translation of measurements made upon them into correspond-
ing measurements made on the animals themselves. There are a variety of

ways by which the latter process may be performed, but it was only after
many trials that a method was found capable of being used with extreme
facility. It will be described later on ; in the mean time, its existence
may be taken for granted. The problem was thenceforward reduced to

that of devising a self-working system by which the more important
pedigree animals, say the prize-winners at great Shows, should be habitu-
ally photographed under standard conditions. Before this could be done
certain doubtful questions had to be solved by an adequate experiment.
ON PEDIGREE STOCK RECORDS.  425

(1) Is it possible to make satisfactory photographs under standard con-
ditions amid tlie hurry and under the necessai-y restrictions of a great
Show ? (2) If so, could they be made at a reasonable cost ? (3) Is there
any likelihood of such a system being self-supporting ?

     The desired experiment was permitted to be made, in response to a
request of the Committee, by the Royal Commissioners on Horse-breeding

at their Show held last March at the Royal Agricultural Hall. On this

occasion 29 premium stallions were selected for service throughout England
durinff the current season, who will become the sires of some 800 foals
within the present twelvemonth. The Committee desire to express their
grateful tlianks to the Royal Commissionei-s for the assistance thus cor-
dially given to them. The results were most satisfactory ; they will be

--found in an Appendix to the Blue Book (C. 9487. Price 2-}iC?.) just issued

by the Royal Commission. Preference should be made to this by those
persons who desire fuller information than is given in this Report. Twenty-
eight out of the 29 premium horses were photographed at the average rate of

six minutes to each horse. Considered merely as portraits, they were very
satisfactory, and they were of a size that gave, roughly, 2 inches or 50 milli-
metres for the height at the withers, being a little less than 1 millimeti'e to
1 inch of real height. Measurements made on them gave results that, in
three-quarters of the cases, did not differ more than |- inch from those made
by two veterinaries on the animals themselves. In tlie remaining quarter
of the cases in which the differences ranged up to a siilgle instance of
2^ inches, it seemed from internal evidences and other considerations that
the photographic method was the more trustworthy of the two. The
experiment further showed that the cost of photography did not exceed
what might be wholly or in part recouped by the sale of prints, and there
was reason to believe that a highly skilled photographer might consent to
take the photographs under standard conditions, at his sole charge, if he
were permitted to sell authorised copies to newspapers and to private
persons under such reasonable restrictions as might be thought proper by

the authorities.

      Should this hope be hereafter realised, it seems ditTicult to imagine

that any serious difficulty would stand in the way of causing the photo-
graphy of prize-winners to become a permanent feature in the larger
Shows of Pedigree Stock. Of course, the uncertainties of weather have
to be reckoned with, and the Shows held during the darker period of the
year, in the smoky atmosphere of large towns, should be left out of con-
sideration, unless artificial light could l)e used. But the more valuable
animals are usually exhibited more than once, so that an occasional photo-

graphic mishap might be subsequently remedied.

     Details relating to what has been said'Avill now bo given; they will
be found stated at greater length in the Appendix to the Blue Book men-

tioned above.

wall, or solid vertical screen, is required for a backgi-ound, and a hard and
level pathway of G feet in width running alongside the wall for the horse

to stand on. Two lines are to be made across the pathway at 2 feet

apart, between which the fore-feet of the horse must stand while he is
being photographed, his body being at the same time as nearly in the line
of the pathway as possible, both of his hind feet being, at all events,
upon it. The pathway should be rather light in colour, to show the feet

clearly ; it may be of flag-stones, concrete, or light-coloured bricks. Its

curb, or edge, towards the camera must be sharp and clearly visible,

because it is an important line of reference in the photograph. The

--wall should be painted of a light colour bluish, not yellow. Fifteen

small marks, each the size of a sixpence, arranged in three horizontal and

five vertical rows, at the exact distance of 3 feet apart, should be made

upon the wall, to give a scale to the photograph. They are indicated in

fig. 1 by small crosses. The lowermost row should be well clear of the

pathway, say 1 foot above its level. Some of these marks will be sure to

be visible in the photograph, though most of them will be hidden by the

body of tlie horse. Simple screens or hangings should shield the horse

Anfrom distracting siglits.  aperture in a screen will enable a person

who is stationed for the purpose on the other side of it to mo-

mentarily arrest the attention of tiie animal when tlie photograph is

about to be taken. The camera is to be firmly clamped to a solid stand

opposite to where the horse is to be placed, and to remain undisturbed

during the whole operation. Its object-glass is to be 5 feet above the

ground, that the view from it of the pathway may not be too much fore-

shortened, and it is to be 30 feet from the wall. The equivalent focus of

the lens should not be less than 9 inches, otherwise the photograph will

be too small for convenient measurement ; the lens used in the experiment

was of 13 inches focus, with plates of G^ x 4| inches, and proved exactly
suitable. The most important point of all is that the plate-holder of the

camera should be strtcthj parallel to tlie wall, as tested by the images of

the marks on the wall forming squares of exactly equal sizes on its

ground-glass focussing screen. As many of tiiem as are visible in the

Aphotograph will, of course, do the same.  label should be fixed to the

wall, well above the back of tlie horse, but within the field of the camera,

on which tlie permanent data of the instalment should appear in bold

letters, easily legible in the photograph. Lastly, the horse should wear a

distinguishing number for after-identification. The photograph will thus

bear internal evidence of the standard conditions having been observed,

Anand will carry its own scale.  experiment succeeded perfectly of indi-

cating the position of the prominence at the hip, which is easily to be felt

but is not distinctly seen, by labelling it with a wafer of thin white paper

the size of a shilling ; thick paste which penetrated between the hairs was

needed to make the wafer adhere. The mark was, however, unnecessarily

large and conspicuous ; one of the size of a sixpence would have been ample.

It might, perhaps, lie printed on the horse with water-colour. The

question whether any, or what, points of anatomical interest might be

treated advantageously in this way has not yet been fully considered.

eflfected with the utmost ease by drawing the installation in its true pro-

inch in the side, and converting the measurements made on the photographs

into their corresponding values as pi-qjections upon the wall, reckoned ni

photographic picture can be reduced to the corresponding real values in
the same general manner. These are the diameters of the body and of the
limbs, the length of the body, and the distances between any points of

reference that may have been marked in the way described above, as seen
in projection against the medium plane of the body.

   --Verification of the Results: Numerous experiments have been made to

test the exactitude of this photographic method of measuring living animals.
The results of those made at the Show of the Royal Commission on Horse-
breeding are given in the Appendix to the Blue Book. They are summarised

--as follows : Two advanced veterinary students were deputed from the

Royal Veterinary College to assist one another in measuring the animals
that were photograplied, for the purpose of controlling the photographic
calculations. Each horse had its height above the ground measured at
the withers, at the hollow of the back, and at the croup. Comparisons
happened to be available in only twenty-six out of the twenty-nine
premium horses, one of tlie latter having not been photographed, and two
out of the remaining twenty-eight having been overlooked by the
measurers. The comparison came out as follows :

      Sums of the Differences between Calculated and Observed Values.

   No. of Cases
                 OS PEDIGREE STOCK RECORDS.     429

It thus appears that iu 52 per cent., or in one-half of the cases, the

differences, when reckoned to the nearest J inch, do not exceed ^ inch,
and that in 74 per cent., or in three-quarters of the cases, tlie differences

do not exceed ^ inch. In the remaining quarter of the cases the differ-

ences ranged upwards to a solitary instance of 2|- inches. This summary

does not, however, include one case where the veterinaries who entered

their measures in ' hands ' of 4 inches each, with the extra inches and

fractions, obviously wrote down the wrong number of hatids, 14 for

15. The entry assigned to the animal indicated an exceptionally hollow

back, which the photograph showed not to bo the case. So the erroneous

entry of ' hands ' was corrected, and then observation and calculation

agreed. Considering the difficulty of measuring a restive, and often

vicious, thoroughbred horse, whom it is somewhat dangerous to tickle

with measuring apparatus, also that each animal was only measured once,

while the photographs were measured at least twice, and again that one

blunder of entry was detected as above, it seems rea.sonablc to ascribe the

larger differences of from 1 inch to 2}- inches mainly to faults connected

with measurement of the animals, and not to those connected with the

photographs. An error in the latter of one millimetre, which corresponds

to al)Out Ij inch of actual height, is liarely credible. This conclusion is

coniirmed by the more equable run of the statistical curve of photographic

measures. It is further confirmed by some experiments made two years

ago on behalf of the Chairman of the present Committee, on the degree of

consistency between the measurements made (1) by the same veterinary

student of the same horses on different occasions, and (2) between the

Ameans of the results of the several students.  discussion of these results

showed that the probable error of a single measurement was considerable,

and therefore that large errors might occasionally occur. Direct measures

of the length of the body of a horse are considered by experts to be very

untrustworthy, but the photographic method gives them with precision

and simplicity. Owing to the roundness of the chest and buttocks, no

correction seems necessary for the foreshortening of an animal that stands

slightly askew.

     Not a few inquiries and experiments have been made in relation to

purely bred shorthorn cattle. Thirty-one triads, each consisting of one

--adult subject, its sire, and its dam the ' subjects ' being the offspring of
--7 bulls and 26 cows have been photographed for the Committee

by Mr. John Patten, jun., under quasi standard conditions. The cattle
were, for the most part, of the herd of the Duke of Northumberland, at
Alnwick Park. The larger portion of the photographs were received too

iate to be properly dealt with in this Report. They seem to afford very

valuable material for study.

indexed 1,528 volumes and tracts, and has now reduced the list of deside-

rata to about 500 items. Of these scarcely 100 are likely to be of any

importance to the systematic zoologist ; but every effort will be made to

consult them, so as to be certain that e\'erything has been recorded.

aided the compiler iji his efforts to obtain the loan of a rare catalogue.

The editors of ' Nature ' and ' La Feuille des jeunes Naturaiistes ' have
lent valuable aid in publishing lists of desiderata. Of the generosity of
the Vienna Kabinet, the Ziirich Library, and Dr. Jentink, all of whom

have sent over their treasures for inspection, the Committee cannot speak

too highly.

     iVgain the special and hearty thanks of the Committee are due to the
Zoological Society of London for pecuniary assistance, which will, as in
the past, greatly facilitate the work of procuring access to this rare

literature.

    The reference slips themselves are now in alphabetical order, and the
work of checking previous reference books and of eliminating duplicate

entries will be proceeded with as quickly as possible.

     In the full belief that the first section of the Index (1758-1800) will
soon be ready for publication as a tangible result of the compiler's labours,
the Committee earnestly recommends its reappointment, with a grant of

The table in the Naples Zoological Station hired by the British Asso-

ciation has been granted during the past year to Dr. H. Ljster Jameson,
of Trinity College, Dublin, the Royal College of Science, London, and the
University of Heidelberg, who occupied it from October 7, 1898, to April

17, 1899. He specially investigated the anatomy of certain Gephyrea

and allied vermiform organisms, and has published a paper upon the lead-
ing species obtained, in the Naples ' Mittheilungen.' Other papers are in
hand and ready for the printer, as set foi'th in his accompanying report.

     Prior to Dr. Jameson's tenure of the table it was occupied but for a
couple of weeks by Mr. Eliot, Secretary to the English Embassy in Con-
stantinople. Mr. Eliot commenced work upon the Mollusca, with a view
to certain economic considerations, but did not cai-ry his enquirv far
enough to justify the presentation of a report.

     Your Committee have been informed by the resident officials at the
Naples Zoological Station that the numbers of investigators who yearly
make use of the institution are steadily on the increase, and that the
material sent out during the year to workers and centres of instruction
and research in all parts of the world has been greater than on any pre-
vious occasion. They would direct attention to this proof of the increas-
ing utility of the Naples station, and to the thoroughly international
character of the accompanying list of workers. In respect to the latter
feature the Naples station stands alone among marine observatories,
now numerous, and your Committee are of opinion that the advantages

associated with the conference of distinguished workers of all nationalities,
taken in conjunction with the richness of the Neapolitan fauna, present to
the individual table-holder a combination not to be obtained elsewhere,
which they regard as sufficient to justify the continued support of the

British Association.
432 REPORT-- 1899.

     They therefore trust that the General Committee will sanction the
payment of a grant of 100^., as in previous years.

     Applications have been received for the coming year from Mr. H. M.
Kyle, M.A., B.Sc, who proposes to investigate the Anatomy of the

Pleuronectidfe, and from Professor W. A. Herdman, F.R.S., to study the

Compound Ascidians of the Bay of Naples.

                  APPENDIX.

I. Report OH the Occupation of the Table on Gephyrea and Allied Worms.
                       By H. Lystek Jameson, B.A., Ph.D.

     During the period for which I had the privilege of occupying the

Association's tables at Naples I confined my studies mainly to the Gephyrea

and other worms.

     I investigated and described in the Naples 'Mittheilungen' an example

of the worm described by Delia Chiaja as Ilololhuridium papillosum.

Only three examples of this worm have been discovered, all of them in the

Gulf of Naples.

In none of these examples was the proboscis preserved, so we have no

idea of the form of this organ.

     The only extant example bad beeu in spirit for some years, and was

kindly placed at my disposal by the authorities of the station. I found
this worm to be an echiuroid Gephyrean, referable to the genus Thalas-

sema, in which genus it occupies a position not far from T. diaphenes,

described by Sluiter from Batavia. These two species agree in their con-

tinuous longitudinal musculature, simple anal vesicles, and single pair of

nephridia. Thalassema papillosum may, however, be distinguished by its

larger size and thicker body wall, as well as by its more highly papillated

body. Fortunately a sketch of the living animal ]>y Signor Merculiano,

taken from an example which was subsequently lost, enables us to realise

the natural colour of this worm. I have had this sketch reproduced in

my paper.

I made some researches upon the sipunculoid Gephyrea, having had

myseveral collections placed in  hands for identification.

The rich supply of living Sipunculoids, placed at my disposal by

Dr. Lo Bianco, was of great service to me in this work.

The results of these investigations are now ready for press.

I am at present describing a new giant, Asjndosiphou, sent to me at

Naples, from Jamaica, by Mr. J. E. Duerden. I believe Fhascolosoma

(Syrinx) ijranulosuin, of INIcCoy, will prove to Ije nothing more than a

large variety of Phyinosoma yramdatum. I have been unable to find any

diflference between examples of the former from the west coast of Ireland,

and of the latter from Naples, except in size.

Other subjects which I investigated, but have not yet sufficiently

studied to warrant publication, are some questions relating to the peri-

intestinal sinus in some worms, and alterations in the musculature of the

intestinal wall which seem to bear a relation to the sinus.

    In conclusion I must offer my hearty thanks to the Committee for
permitting me to occupy their table, and to the authorities of the station

for the excellent opportunities and encouragement they gave me.

     GoDMAN, Mr. P. L. ScLATER, Mr. E. A. Smith, and Mr. D.

     Sharp {Secretary).

The Committee was appointed in 1890, and has l)een annually re-

appointed. During the past year it has received grants from the Royal

Society and the Trustees of the Honolulu Museum for the publication of
its results. Two parts (under the title of ' Fauna Hawaiiensis ') have

already appeared, one by Mr. R. C. L. Perkins and Professor Forel, on the
Hymenoptera aculeata, the other by Mr. E. Meyrick, on the Macro-

Lepidoptera. These two parts enumerate 490 species, 331 of which are

new. The third and fourth parts (Orthoptera and Neuroptera) are in the

press, and subsequent parts are in a more or less advanced state of

preparation.

     The Committee has been fortunate in being able to retain the services
of Mr. Perkins, for which purpose the balance of the grant made to the
Committee by the Trustees of the Honolulu Museum, and certain sums

received from the British Museum for the preparation of specimens, have

been appropriated. These resources are at present exhausted, and the

Committee has no balance in hand except its publication fund.

The Committee considers it desirable that more complete evidence

should be procured, and entertains the idea of again sending out Mr.

Perkins to the islands. The fauna is being extirpated with increasing

rapidity, and the natural conditions of the native animal life entirely

upset                      hence exploration, to be satisfactory,  should be done at once.
                        ;

The Committee has obtained a grant from the Government Grant

Committee of the Royal Society, and the Trustees of the Honolulu

Museum have signified their intention of again adding a proportional sum
to any amount that may be raised in this country.

     The Committee therefore asks the Association for a grant of 100/., to
be used either for the purpose of sending Mr. Perkins again to the islands

or for continuing work in this country, as may seem most desirable.

              The Embryology of the Polyzoa. By T. H. Taylor.

BowEKBANKiA was found at the beginning of August to be breeding.
Stones and shells with healthy colonies were dredged from the sound and
placed in vessels of sea-water well supplied with suitable alg:\?, and larvaj
were spawned in abundance. The larva is found in the parent polypide
in the tentacle-sheath by the eversion of which it is passed to the exterior.
Spawning generally takes place in the morning, only an occasional larva

appearing after midday.

     The larvae are strongly influenced by light, and it is easy to cause
them to migrate from side to side of the aquarium by altering the illu-
mination. In order to test their response a beaker was wrapped round

witli black paper on one side of which a window was cut. On introducing

the larvaj, they quickly appeared at the window, and remained there
swimming about for some time. Eventually they disappeared, and were
found to have settled on the floor of the vessel.

     The free swimming period is very short. Of a batch spawned in the
morning almost all have fixed by the early afternoon, and it is rare to
find any left in the evening. The study of the free larva is greatly
facilitated by its capacity for intra-vitam staining : toluidin blue was

used for this purpose. After fixation the larva rapidly passes through
its metamorphosis, and becomes a hemispherical cystide covered by a

delicate cuticle, and containing the degenerated larval tissues. From one

side a blunt process grows out as a stolon over the surface of the sub-
stratum, and is cut off" by a septum from the cystide, which gradually

develops into the primary polypide.

    As the attachment of the cystide is very cluse, and cannot be loosened

wilhuut injury, advantage was taken of the response to light in the larva
to secure its fixation on a manageable substratum. Celloidin films were
used according to the method adopted by Pronho for polyzoan and by
Vosmaer for sponge larvas. There is a great advantage in working with
larvse fixed on films, as there is no risk of losing them while they are
being carried through the various reagents ; and celloidin is very suitable,
as it is quite transparent, and tears into convenient strips. After the
larvae had fixed the films were transferred to an aquarium and kept till
required. In this way a series of stages was obtained. Flemming and a
mixture of acetic and corrosive were used as fixatives.

    I have to express my sincere thanks to the Committee of the British

Association for their permission to occupy their table at the Plymouth
Laboratory, and also to Mr. E. J. Allen, the Director, for his kind interest

aud many helpful suggestions.

438 REPORT-- 1899.

   The Rearing of Larvcn of Echinidce. By Professor E. W. MacBride.

     The problem which engaged my attention during the spring of 1898,

when I occupied the Cambridge University Table, and during the present
summer, when I held the Table belonging to this Association, was the
rearing of the larvaj of echinoderms. Since the work done this year was
only the completion of that commenced in 1898, the results of the two
years may be considered together. The primary object which I had in
view was the collection of sufficient material to enable me to undertake a

thorough investigation of the formation of the organs in the Echinida?,
along similar lines to the researches already published on the development

of Asterina gibbosa. The object was accomplished this summer in the
case of one species, viz. Echinus esculentus ; but as it will be some con-
siderable time before the material can be worked up, I shall content my-
self with mentioning some points of general interest in connection Avith
the rearing, since these may throw some light on the problem of the rear-

ing of the eggs of marine animals in general.

     So far as I am aware, the larvae of the Echinidse have heretofore been

successfully reared only by two people, viz. Theel and Bury. The'el has
already published his method, and the results of his work, so far as

Echinocyainus piisillus is concerned ; he has also told me that he has
reared Echinus miliaris. Bury informed me some time ago that he

had reared a few plutei of one of the Neapolitan species through the

--metamorphosis ; but he experimented to judge from his description

with only very few at a time.

    Dr. Dohrn informed me that unsuccessful attempts had been made at

Naples to keep larvse living until they had metamorphosed by following

Theel's directions ; it may therefore be inferred that these directions have
not fully described the difficulties which crop up in the course of the

experiment.

     There are throe species of Echinus commonly found in Plymouth, viz.,
E. miliaris, E. esculentus, and E. acutus. The last two in colour and
size closely resemble one another ; E. acutus has, however, longer and
sparser spines than E. esculentus ; it is not so commonly found, and Mr.

Allen informs me that it is an inhabitant of deeper water. E. miliaris,

on the other hand, does not attain more than half the size of the other
two species, and its predominantly green colour serves at once to dis-
tinguish it from them.

     The eggs of E. miliaris and E. acutus are aliout the same size ; that of
E. esculentus is about double the size of either, and it was for this reason
especially that I selected the last species as the most suitable. The size
of the egg is, of course, conditioned by the amount of yolk ; and the
greater the amount of yolk, the greater, so to speak, is the initial velocity
with which the development is launched : the longer the time before the
larvae has to depend exclusively on its own exertions for food.

     Experiments were made also with E. miliaris and E. acutus ; the

larvae of E. miliaris is strikingly different at all stages of development
from that of E. esctdentus, and in a forthcoming paper in the ' Quarterly
Journal of Microscopical Science ' these differences will be detailed. I
only succeeded in rearing the'larvte of E. acutus for the first ten days of its
existence, and during this time it strikingly resembled that of E. escu-
lentus, but was in correspondence with the smaller size of the egg of about
half the size of the larvre of E. esculentus.
            ON THE MAKIXE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, PLYMOUTH, 439

     In order to obtain good results it is first of all necessary to use none
but fully developed and thoroughly ripe males and females for the experi-
ment. It is possible to get ripe eggs and spermatozoa from under-sized
individuals, and also from ovaries and testes, the greater bulk of which con-
sists of unripe sexual cells ; but in no case did the larva? produced from

these live more than a short time. When the genital organ is ready at a

touch to dissolve into eggs or spermatozoa, then and then only may

success be anticipated.

     The great essential condition for success is that the larva3 should be
placed in pure sea-water, brought from some distance from the shore. In

Plymouth the water must be brought from beyond the breakwater. And

hence the success of any experimental work at Plymouth depends entirely
on the possibility of procuring a continuous and abundant supply of this

' outside ' water. Lest it should be thought that this is only necessary in

the case of Echini, I may mention the fact that although ylsierina gibbosa

will live in the tanks and lay its eggs there, these invariably fail to
develop. Nevertheless, in Naples every year crowds of the larvse of this
hardy species are obtained by simply throwing the adults into the tanks
and leaving them there under the ordinary circulation,

     Mr. Allen, the courteous director of the Plymouth Laboratory, strained

the resources at his command in order to provide me with an abundant

supply of pure water ; but the only method of bringing it to the Labora-
tory at present available is carriage on the backs of the servants of the
Laboratory from the shore to a height of over 1 00 feet, and it is obvious
that under these conditions the amount available is very limited. One
cannot help feeling that if Plymouth is to become successful as a centre
of scientific work some capital expenditure must be incurred in oi'der to
provide for the better transport of ' outside ' water to the Laboratory.

    As soon as the eggs had reached the blastula stage and had become

free-swimming, they were decanted oft" from the remainder which had
developed abnormally or not at all. The blastulfe were then transferred
to a number of two-gallon jars, each fitted with the plunger devised by Mr,
Browne, of University College, London.

     It is absolutely necessary that the jars should be protected from direct
sunlight ; for this purpose a sheet of blackened paper was attached to tho
exposed side.

      If the action of the plunger be stopped, the larvjv, if healthy, will in
a short time reach the top ; it is then possible to siphon off the bottom
water.

     This, however, was not often done, and on one occasion some larvie of
Echinus v>iiZia»"is lived for a month in one of these jars without progressing
beyond the stage usually reached in seven days. The tendency of these
larva? to, so to speak, ' hang ' in development without progressing, renders
it impossible to make accurate statements as to the time they normally
require to metamorphose. Even under the best conditions obtainable in
a laboratory, it is probable that development is slower than in the open sea.

    At the end of about a week it was usually fouud that in one jar (ten

in all were used) the larva? were particularly healthy and advanced. All
the others were then discarded, and the healthy larvae distributed over the
remaining jars, which were, of course, filled up with fresh sea-water. After
another week the most healthy were transferred to ten-gallon jars fitted
with large plungers. About 200 were put in each jar, and they then
commenced to develop the spines and tube feet of the adult Echinus.
--440 REPORT 1899.

     It is necessary to change about two gallons of the water every clay.
At the end of 43 to 45 days some specimens were found on the bottom of

the jar metamorphosed. For convenience of observation the remainder

were transferred to a number of half-gallon jars which were immersed in

one of the Laboratory tanks to keep them cool. About three larvae were

placed in each jar, but development did not go on as well or as quickly as

in the large jar.

     The reflection will occur to most people that the method I have

described is a roundabout and cumbersome one. Why not, it may be

urged, transfer at once 200 blastulse to a ten-gallon jar ? The answer to

this is that I have tried this experiment, and that it failed. From my

experience it seems as if it were necessary to allow Nature to select the

healthiest larvae ; the experimenter cannot pick out the blastulse which

are fit to survive. At the end of 14 days a larva has a much greater hold

on life, and if unhealthy conditions supervene, such as insufficient change

in the water, it will often continue to grow without developing the organs

of the adult.

     Plenty of room is a cardinal condition for the success of all rearing

experiments. When I had removed all the best larvfe to the half-gallon

jars, I left behind in the ten-gallon jar a few of what I thought unhealtliy

larvaj. To my surprise and delight on the last day of my stay in Plymouth,

I found practically all these either metamorphosed or just about to complete

this process. To sum up, the necessary conditions for success are : (1) Selec-

tion of perfectly ripe full-grown males and females for fertilisation ; (2) use

of outside water                                                     (3) action of natural selection for the first week ; (4) the
                                                                  ;

use of the plunger ; (5) frequent change of water ; (6) shading from exces-

sive light ; and (7) plenty of room.

This is not the place to enter into a discussion of the internal changes

which go on in development, a subject which I reserve for a later paper,

but it seemed to me that these observations of the conditions of successful

rearing might be of interest to a wider circle than specialists in echino-

derms. It was some time ago usual to regard the larvse of echinoderms

as the most difficult objects to rear. So far from this being the case, I

believe that of all true larvce they are really the easiest. I use the term

' true larvae ' advisedly, for comparative embryology has too long confined

itself to the study of cases such as those of ^stacus amongst Crustacea,

Pisidium and Cyclas amongst MoUusca, and A.sterina f/ibbosa amongst

Echinodermata, where the word ' larva' is only applicable to the young by

a scarcely justifiable stretch of its meaning.

   A larva is exposed to the struggle for existence with the environ-

ment, and depends on its own exertions for food, but this is not the case,

as reflection will .show, with most of the life-histories which, so to speak,

have served as paradigms for comparative embryology. And yet, when

one or two cases of true larval development have been successfully in-

vestigated, how full of meaning and interest they have shown themselves

to be ! I need only mention the instances of Lucifer and Penseus

amongst Crustacea to prove this. The difficulty in such studies has

always been the question of rearing.

    I hope that the observations recorded above may be of assistance to
any investigator who is attempting to make advances in this field, which
seems to me to be one of the most hopeful for the future development of

comparative embryology.

--Zoological and Botanical Publication. Report of the Committee, con-

    sisting of Eev. T. R, R. Stebbing (Chairman), Professor W. A.
    Herdman, Mr. W. E. Hoyle, Dr. P. L. kScLATER, Mr. Adam

     Sedgwick, Dr. D. Sharp, Mr. C. D. Sherborn, Professor

    W. F. R. Weldon, Mr. A. C. Seward, Mr. B. Daydon Jackson,

     and Mr. F. A. Bather (Secretarg).

The Report of this Committee for 1897, specially addressed to the editors of

academical and periodical publications, has now been sent to all the lead-

ing societies and journals that publish either zoological or botanical
-- Acommunications, or both about 800 in all.
                                                  special slip was inclosed

drawing attention to the fact that the recommendations of the Committee

were applicable to botanical no less than to zoological publications.

The difficulty of finding many of the desired addresses suggests that the

compilation of a list of publishing societies and of current periodicals with

their postal addresses would be of much service to workers in science.

Existing lists are as a rule deficient in regard to the addresses.

respectfully requests its reappointment, without a grant' of nloney.

--PlanJdon and Fhydcal Conditions of the Mnglish Channel. First

    Report of the Committee, consisting o/ Professor E. Ray Lankester

    (Chairman), Professor W. A. Herdman, Mr. H. N. Dickson, and
    Mr. W. Garstang (Sccretari/), appointed to mal;e Periodic Investi-

     gations of the PlanJdon and Pliysical Conditions of the JEnglish

      Channel during 1899.

The proposed investigations have been carried out at quarterly intervals

during the year by Mr. Garstang, who was enabled by means of the grant

to hire a steam tug for the work during February, INIay, and the first week

of September. Except for a few small items for temporary apparatus at

sea, the whole of the expended grant (05/.) has been devoted to the hire of

Aa suitable steamboat for the periodic survey.    small balance (5/.)

remains, but as two further cruises will bo necessary to complete the

investigation, the Committee desires its reappointment with a grant of

bOl. (in addition to the unexpended balance).

The observations of temperature and salinity and the collections of

plankton obtained will furnish data for a complete year's record of the

periodic changes in the physical character of the water and in the quantity

and character of the floating fauna and flora in the mouth of the English

--Channel a standard record which will be of the highest value in many

branches of marine biological and hydrographical inquiry.

Most of the apparatus used has been provided by the Marine Bio-

logical Association, which has borne all the expenditure I'equired for the

more costly nets and gear. The Committee is also indebted to the Royal

Society Grant Committee for the loan of armoured hose and an extra deep

sea thermometer.

The collections are deposited in the Plymouth laboratory of the

Marine Biological Association, where the work of identification and

quantitative determinj^tion will be carried out.
ON PLAJIKTON AND PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF ENGLISH CHANNEL. 445

    As the year's collections are not yet complete, the Committee confines its

repoi't on the present occasion to a description of the methods and apparatus

employed, and hopes to present a final report at tlie Bradford meeting.

   --The route fixed for the Survey consisted of the following lines :

(1) from Plymouth to TJshant, with stations in mid-Channel (W fathoms)

and off Ushant (GO fathoms) (2) from Ushant in a westerly direction
                                                                                                                                             ;

towards the 100-fathom line, with a station near Par.son's Bank (75

fathoms) ; (3) from Parson's Bank northwards towards Mount's Bay, with

a station in  50 fathoms                                                                (4) from                         Mount's Bay to Plymouth.
                                                                                     ;

The hydrographic apparatus employed consisted on all occasions of

Negretti and Zamhra's Deep-sea E,ever,sible Thermometers, and of one of

Dr. Mill's Water Bottles. Complete series of temperatures were taken on

all occasions.

    On the February cruise the biological apparatus consisted of a number

of silk-gauze nets of various meshes for surface collections and of a semi-

rotary hand-pump and 40 fathoms of armoui-ed hose (having a diameter

of one inch) for quantitative samples both of surface and deep-water

plankton. Accessory apparatus for filtering the plankton and measuring

the volume of water filtered was also provided.

The results obtained by pvimping appeared to l)e quite satisfactory for

quantitative determination of the more immobile elements of the plank-

ton, such as diatoms and even the smaller copepods ; but the vertical
distribution of the plankton was found to be so variable, under the varying

influence of darkness and light, even at a depth of 40 fathoms, that the

length of hose, which alone was obtainable with the means at the Com-

mittee's disposal, was inadequate to provide a proper series of samples for

comparative purposes in cases where the depth exceeded 50 fathoms.

On returning from this cruise, therefore, Mr. Garstang determined to

attempt a solution of the difficulties which have hitherto invested the

pi'oblem of a simple but efficient opening and closing net for horizoiital

towing ; as well as to construct a vertical net, after Hensen's pattern, for
comparative estimation of the total quantity of plankton present at

difi'erent places and at different seasons.

     These nets were ready for use towards the end of May, and were

employed with perfect success during the May and September cruises. As

the closing net has proved to be a thoroughly reliable instrument, the

principles of its construction are hei-e briefly given, and the net itself will

be exhibited and tried at sea during the Dover Meeting. (The trials took

place on September 17 on board Mr. J. W. Woodall's yacht Vallota, in

the presence of Sir John Murray, Mr. H. N. Dickson, and Mr. I. G.

Thompson, and were completely successful.)

The principal obstacles to the use of closing nets for horizontal towing

at definite depths have been (1) the tendency of the net to oscillate,
during towing, through a thick stratum of water, depending on inevitable

variations in the rate of                                                               towing                           (2) the                                      uncertainty of  determining  the
                                                                                                                      ;

actual depth of the net at any moment, owing to the curvature of the line

produced by the resistance of the water                                                                                                                               (3) the difliculty of ensuring the
                                                                                                                                                                   ;

proper opening and complete closure of the net at the depth required.

     It appeared that the first and second obstacles might be overcome by
combining a minimum resistance of the towing line and net with a

maximum weight of the net frame. The net was therefore designed to bo
towed by fine steel wire instead of a hempen line, and provision was made

f(|)r a heavy net frame to suppoi't a snjall net, as well as for the voluntary
                                                                                                                              --

--446 REPORT 1899.

addition of extra weight to any degree that might appear to be required.

The wire employed was provided by Messrs. Latch li' Batehelor, Limited,

of Birmingham. They describe it as No. 16 (i, and give its breaking

strain as 790 pounds.

The essential parts of the frame are the same as in Giesl)recht's net,

but the modifications inti'oduced are in the direction of a much greater

Asimplicity.  quadrangular jointed metal frame slides up and down a

cylindrical axis, formed by a stout rigid metal tube, which is furnished

with a guide. When the frame is opened, the aperture is diamond-

shaped ; when shut, the two upper limbs of the frame approximate
tightly to the corresponding lower limbs. Both pairs of limbs can be

supported in the closed position at the top of the tubular axis by metal

springs, on the principle employed by Dr. H. E.. Mill in his well-known

self -locking water-bottle. Owing to the fact, however, that the releasing

gear had to be doubled in the case of the net, the set of springs which

support the loirrr limbs of the frame were attached inside the tubular

axis, which is perforated at three points for the protrusion of the sup-

porting edges of the springs. Release of the frame is effected in each case

by the action of a metal cap which can be driven over the springs by the
actioii of a messenger. The first messenger (a narrow one) drives down

the inner cap and releases the lower limbs of the frame, which then

descend l)y their own weight and open the net to  its  utmost extent                                                          the
                                                                                                                           ;

second messenger (a broad one) is arrested by the outer cap, drives it

down, and releases the upper part of the frame, thus closing the net again,

but in this case at the bottom of the axis, instead of at the top. By means

of messengers both movements are thus under the control of the operator

on the deck of the ship, whatcA-er be the depth to which the net is lowered.

Another important departure from the Giesbrecht net, whether in its

orighial form, or as modified by the Prince of Monaco, consists in the

method by which the proper orientation of the net is ensured. The wire,

in fact, is attached to a central pivot upon which the tubular axis of the

frame, which bears all the weight, is free to rotate. Friction is reduced

to a minimum by means of ball beai'ings. In this way tlie possibility of any

revolution of the net round a vertical axis, either during descent, towing, or

ascent, as a consequence of the twisting of the wire, is completely avoided

a very important matter, for if the frame were to revolve during its descent,

the gauze net attached to it would be wra2:)ped round the axis or the hori-

zontal limbs of the frame, and the opening of the net would be impeded,

and probably quite prevented. On no occasion, however, has such an

--accident happened a fact which bears witness to the efficiency of the

means taken to prevent it. The net never failed to come up to the sur-

face properly closed, so that the reliability of the results obtained by the

net can be confidently assumed. Although on this occasion it is not

proposed to go into any details, Mr. Garstang reports that the difference
between the plankton of different levels as revealed by this new net were

in many cases of a most conspicuous character, a fact which will be fully
demonstrated in the final report of the Committee. The various hauls

made by the net at different times of the day and night also show in a
clear and convincing manner the efVect of light and darkness upon the
vertical movements of pelagic organisms in the Channel waters.

It is consequently proposed to continue the investigations until

February 1900, in order to complete a full year's survey under identical

conditions with the same apparatus.

ON BIMD migration in great BRITAIN AND IRELAND.         447

Bird Miyration in Great Britain a.nd Ireland.-- Second Interim Report

    of the Committee, consisting of Frokssor Newton (Chairman), the

     late Mr. John Cordeaux (Secretary), Mr. Harvie-Brown, Mr.
     R. M. Barrington, Rev. E. Ponsonbv Knubley, and Dr. If. O.
     Forbes, ajypointed to worh out the details of the Observations of
     the Migration of Birds at Lighthouses and Lightships, 1880-87.

Your Committee has to deplore the loss it has sustained by the recent

death of its Secretary, Mr. Cordeaux, who, ever since the subject of the

migration of birds was first brought before tlie Association at Swansea in
1S80, when lie was made Secretary of the Committee then appointed, has

devoted an incalculable amount of time and labour to the work in hand.

If Mr. Cordeaux were not the first to suggest the employment of the

light-keepers in obtaining observations, he was certainly the first to prove

its practicability, and the success which attended the inquiry must be

attributed almost wholly to his skilful conduct of it. All the complicated

details of schedules, circulars, and other information supplied to tiie

observers were carefully thought out by him, and he carried on the

greater part of the necessary correspondence which, in the earlier years of

this inquiry, was enormous, while raising by his own exertions the funds

needed to defray its expenses, which amounted to at least twice as much

as the grants from time to time received from the Association--though

these have not been inconsiderable. Even a still greater service was per-

formed by him in getting the men at the Lighthouses and Lightships to

take a real interest in the business, for all depended on their cheerful

co-operation, which was given voluntarily and was gratuitously rendered.

In continuation of the Interim Report of last year, your Committee

has to inform the Association that Mr. William Eagle Clarke, of the

Museum of Science and Art at Edinburgh, has continued working out the

details of the collected observations, in accordance witli the scheme before

indicated                                but that,  as then stated, some two or three years will be
                                      ;

needed to do this in a satisfactory way. The woi'k is attended by some

expense, and your Committee, while respectfully soliciting reappointment,

begs also for a renewed grant of money. Your Committee has the satis-

faction of presenting the following statement received from Mr. Clarke as

to the progress he is making :

     ' Considerable progress has been made since the last Report. The
work of supplementing the data amassed by the Committee has been com-
pleted, with the result that no fewer than about L5,000 useful records
have been added to the observations available. Most of these records
iiave been tabulated, and incorporated with the original data, and the
completion of this portion of the task is now receiving attention.

      ' In addition, all the information relating to the occurrences of the
rarer species for all years has been amassed and will be utilised.

      'I hope to proceed at once to treat of species, giving the results

obtained concerning the migrations of each-- a task which^ must neoea-

sarily take a considerable time to accomplish.'

_ Your Committee takes this opportunity of making known that one of
its members (Mr. Barrington) has, on his own account, continued to

collect observations from the Irish Lights since the year 1887, when they
were discontinued by the Committee of the Association, and has printed
the results, which contain many valuable records, up to 1896.

     (Braivn up hy the Chairman.')

Meteorological I'eturns have reached your Committee, in the course of

--last year, from forty stations in Africa.

Webeen received from Mr. E. G. Fenton, the medical officer.  regret that

     British Central Africa. The scientific department, under the zealous
direction of Mr. J. McClounie, is now in full working order, and full

repoi'ts have been received for two stations of the second order, namely,

Zomba on the highland, and Fort Johnston on the Lake Level, as also

reports, more or less complete, from twenty-two other stations. Mr.

McClounie hopes to be able, in the course of the present year, to equip

two more stations of the second order, namely, Chinde on the coast, and

another station on the lake. He has attemjjted to make two-liourly

observations on term days, but as the exposure in the morning air resulted

in fever, he has given up the attempt.

   We have, in addition, received three years' registers for Lauderdale,

from our most faithful correspondent, Mr. John W. Moir, as also fifteen

months' record from Kambola, a station of the London Missionary Society,

near the southern extremity of Tanganyika. The observer at the latter

place is Dr. James F. Mackay.

  --British East Africa. Returns from eiglit Government stations have

been received. These returns are, of course, most welcome, and they

speak well for the zeal of Mr. Craufurd and the officers working under liim
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but considering the practical importance of meteorological work, it is much

to be desired that something more should l)e done. Let us hope that the

satisfactory working of a ' Scientific Department ' in the South African

Protectorate may induce the authorities to organise a similar institution
for East Africa and Uganda. As a proof of the high value placed upon

work of this kind in the neighbouring German Protectorate, we may state

that a professional meteorologist has been appointed as inspector, and
that there are now at work twenty-six stations, including two of the first

and seven of tlie second order.

   We are likewise in receipt of rainfall observations made by the

Rev. Pt. M. Ormerod at Golbanti, on the Tana river.

The old Scottish Missionary Station at Kibwezi has been abandoned,

and the missionaries have removed to a new station in Kikuyu, whence

three months' observations have already been forwarded.

   --Uganda. The valuable observations on the level of the Victoria

Nyanza have been resumed since the suppression of tiie mutiny.

    Mr. C. W. Hobley has forwarded two years' record of the rainfall at

Mumia's, the headquai-ter station of Kavirondo.

Our earth thermometer has accompanied Captain Austin during his

journey to Lake Rudolf, but no record of work done has hitherto been

received.

Your Committee propose that they be reappointed. They do not ask

for a grant.

ON THE CLIMATOLOGY OF AFRICA.      449

                                                   Nyasaland.

     Mr. J. McCloiinie, lieail of the Scientific Department of British Central Africa, lias forwarded to the

Committee the foUowiufj remarks on the weather, dated Zomba, May 12, 1899 :
    The year of 1898-99 has not been marked by any extraordinary features. lu the absence of any

records for past years, 1898-99 may be taken a< a good one all round. No lengthy damaging drought
was experienced. No great rainfall was registered for the year, t.''. what may be termed zero to zero,

and being the twelve months from October to September, botli inclusive.
    The rainy season practically commences in October and continues to May, during which time spring

and summer prevail, autumn following on in the coldest mouths, and winter, antipodal to England with
regai-d to temperature, as tlie temperature rises daily all over the country until tlie rains of^ October and
the following montlis cool the atmosphere. Be it undei'stood, of course, that in what is termed the
' -.vet seasou ' there is no inference that rain falls continuously during these months, as this is not the
ease. Tliuuderstorms, tliough frequent, are of brief duration. From Zomiia, the progress of thunder-
storms can be seen forty miles away ; they are seen to traverse the plain quickly, and rain may be seen

falling at tlu-ee or four different places simultaneously.

     During the months of August, September, and October, and sometimes November, vegetation is at a
.standstill, the accumuliitiug heat from the sun's southing having completely dried the grass and made
hard and hot the paths. Bush fires are numerous, and soon there remains nothing but large blackened
areas. On this the ground temperature is very great, and almost unbearable by the natives, whose
b.tre feet get badly cracked. As a result of the great temperatures, whirlwinds may be observed long
distances away speeding across the plain ; a long black column, small at the ground but widening out
at the top, 150 feet to 200 feet high, is a frequent object of interest. Occasionally a whirlwind of more
than usual violence may reach the dwellings at Zomba or Blantyre, and dangerously shake the iron
roofs. Trees and shrubs are also very much blown about, and sometimes overthrown.

    The sunshine during August, September, and October is almost continuous from morning till evening.
High temperatures are tlie rule, and the atmosphere very dry. The bush fires continue, and a heavy
haze hangs like a pall over the land untU the copious rains in November extinguish the fires and clear
the air. Two or three showers are looked for in September, and are called (locally) Kokalupsya, or the
early rain, but these are slight. On them, however, the planting community base their hopes for the
success of the next year's crop, by their bringing the coffee into flower and setting the fruit.

    From Fort Johnston full and excellent returns have been received, observed by Mr. F. S. S. Wright,

of the Naval Department.
    Excellent climatological returns were received from Nkata Bay and Cholo, the observers being

Mr. C. A. Cardew and Mr. Geo. Adamson.
    Other climatological stations commenced during the year, and good registers are now being received.

The way in which planters and missionaries have responded to the request for rainfall readings has been
very encouraging, and these, together with administration stations, give rainfall readings for twenty-two

places.

    It is not my desire at the present time to go into the tables and make comparisons of the different

stations, or point out any special feature, the object of this--the first Report-- being to try in a way to
illustrate the general n:iture of the climate of British Central Africa, and which, 1 hope, may be found
compatible with the tables. The barometric and other reductions have been obtained from ' Smithsonian

Meteorological Tables,' 1896 edition, and my thanks are due to Mr. Eaveustein for the courteous manner

in which he has at times assisted and advised me.

     J. Scott-Keltie {Chairman), Professor I. B. Balfour, Professor

    W. F. E. WELDOJf, and Dr. H. 0. Forbes {Secretary), appointed

      to explore the Island of Sohotra. {Drawii np l»j the Secretary.)

The present report is preliminary to a fuller illustrated account of the

results of the expedition to be issued as a special publication of the

Liverpool Museums, edited by the Secretary, who is Director of that

Institution.

     The members of the expedition were Dr. H. O. Forbes, Director of

Museums to the Corporation of Liverpool ; Mr. W. R. Ogilvie-Grant, of the
Ornithological Department of the British Museum and the Taxidermist

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

of the Liverpool Museums. The expedition was aided by a contribution
from the Government grant of the Royal Society, by a vote of money and
of instruments from the Royal Geographical Society, and by a grant of
351. from the British Association made at its meeting last year at Bristol.
The Trustees of the British Museum and of the Liverpool Museums also
contributed generously to the expenses and the outfit of the expedition.

     The party left England on October 28, 1898, and arrived in Aden on
November 18. The entire voyage out was utilised in making a collection
X)i the minute organisms which abound in the sea, by sieving the water

through very fine silk nets attached to the discharge pipe of pumps, which,
by the courtesy of the owners and the captain of the Manora, were
allowed to work uninterruptedly day and night.

     The members of the expedition, who on their arrival in Aden were

immediately received by the Political Resident, Brigadier-General Creagh,
V.C., were deeply disappointed to learn from him that, owing to political
difficulties which had arisen betAveen the Indian Government and the
Sultan of Sokotra, it would be impossible for them to proceed to their
destination. The Resident had, before their departure from England,
cabled to the India Office in London that they should be advised to post-
 pone their visit, but, through some unexplained cause, that information

 was not conveyed to them. Their arrival in Aden was, therefore,
naturally a surprise to the Political Resident, who, in the fullest sympathy

with the position in which they found themselves, the same day despatched
an urgent message to the Indian Government, explaining the situation,
·and urging some speedy arrangement of the difliculty which had arisen, so

 as to enable the expedition, if possible, to proceed to Sokotra.

      It is impossible to express fully the grateful thanks of the members
 of the expedition to General Creagh for his personal hospitality and for
 his great kindness in doing everything possible to make the days of the
enforced stay of the expedition in Aden of profit to it. The Government
 bungalow at Sheik Othman, some twelve miles north of Aden, was
 generously lent to the expedition by him, and later, through his recom-
 mendation, an invitation was received from the Sultan of Lahej, in South
 Arabia, for the expedition to visit his dominions. His Highness met the
members of the party at his boundary, conveyed them to the capital,
 hospitably entertained them, and assisted them in every possible way
 during their stay.

      The Committee have to express their obligations to the military autho-
             ON EXPLORATION OF SOKOTKA.                                       461

rities in Aden in lending the expedition fur this journey baggage- and

riding-camels from the garrison establishment, and also the attendance

upon them as a guard of a native officer (jemadar) and one sowar. The

helpful aid of the First Political Assistant, Captain Jacob, in all these

Aarrangements must also be very cordially acknowledged.                       most profit-

able stay could undoubtedly have been made at Lahej, which is a very

little- explored region, had the expedition been eventually prevented from

visiting Sokotra. It had only, however, begun what was proving to be a^
veiy interesting collecticn when intimation was received from General

Creagli that authority had been obtained from the Government of India

Afor the expedition to proceed to its destination.                            speedy return having

therefore been made to Aden, where eight Somali servants were engaced

to accompany it in various capacities, the expedition embarked on

December 1, 1898, with its stores and baggage, on board the Royal

Indian Marine steamer Elphinstone, which the Indian Government had

very generously placed at its disposal to carry it to and from the island.

Authority had also been obtained from General Creagh to break the

voyage for several days at Abd-el-Kuri, an island lying between Sokotra

and Cape Guardaf ui on the Eastern Horn of Africa. This islet had never

before been  scientifically  examined                                         and during the short stay made
                                                                           ;

there several species of animals and plants new to science were dis-

covered, among them a very notable species of Euphorbia {Euphorbia

abdelkuri), belonging to a family of plants of which many singular forms

occur in Sokotra. The geological structure of the island was found to
present many points of similarity to that of Sokotra. It has suffered

great denudation, however, for the limestone, which is of both Cretaceous

and Tertiary age, has disappeared everywhere except on one or two sum-

--mits. Volcanic rocks abound, and from the high peak 1,750 feet in

--height overlooking the anchorage they resembled a number of papillae

rising from a desert of sand. The island has but few inhabitants, who

are very poor and miserably housed. Some of them are fishers and divers

for pearl-shell. Numerous chelonian carapaces strewn about near their

huts indicated that the hawk's-bill turtle was a common frequenter of

their coasts. The most notable feature of the vegetation was the absence

of those characteristic plants of Sokotra, the dragon's blood {Dracce.na)^

myrrh (Balsamodendron), and frankincense {Boswellia) trees, though Abd-

el-Kuri lies nearer to the African coast than the main island.

' The geological collections made on Abd-el-Kuri,' as Dr. Gregory in

a preliminary note reports, ' show that the island consists of a block of

Archiean rocks similar to those of Sokotra, and it contains dykes of the

coarse pegmatite common ia Somaliland. Above the gneiss series is a

limestone of Cretaceous date which occurs on the highest point of the

island, so that the whole of it was submerged at a time when Sokotra was

probably a land area. The most recent limestone in the island is a.

low-lying Pleistocene reef containing Goniastrea reti/ormis.'

The poverty of the fauna and flora of the island is, therefore, in agree-

ment with its geological history.

Two new species of birds, only slightly differentiated from species

occurring both in Sokotra and Somaliland, indicate the comparatively

recent separation of Abd-el-Kuri from the mainland.

    On December 6 the Elphinstone left Abd-el-Kuri, and on the 7th

anchored off" Hadibu, the capital of Sokotra. On the 8th Dr. Forbes,

accompanied by the commander of the Elphinytonf, landed and was
                                                                         ----

received by the Sultan, to whom he presented letters of introduction from

the Government. Permission was readily granted by the Sultan to visit

all parts of the island. The next day the expedition went ashore and

Acamped in the mountain-girt plain in which Hadibu stands.      week

was spent there investigating the northern slopes of the Haghier

Mountains. On the 18th of the month the camp was moved to Dahamis,

at an elevation of 1,500 feet, where the Europeans of the party were all

unfortunately very soon laid down by a most pernicious form of malaria.

Excellent collections were, nevertheless, obtained in their convalescent

intervals. On the 26th, however, it was decided to move to Kamahanu,

a hill in the Garieh Plains, where it was hoped a more salubrious camping-

ground would be found. But the continued sickness of the party

among whom for several days there was not a single undisabled member

--made it necessary, after a few days' trial of this camp, to seek a still

higher altitude on the Haghier range. The tents were consequently struck

on December 30 and transported to Jena-agahan, where, notwithstanding

that fever was still very prevalent and the expedition was practically

deprived, during the greater part of the time of its stay there (owing to

his serious illness), of the services of the taxidermist, many of the most

interesting specimens in the collection were secured, the most notable

perhaps being the beautiful wild ass, of which large herds roamed the

plains below the camp. On January 15 the camp was moved a two days'

journey to the high plateau of Homhil, which proved to be a most success-

ful collecting station. The health of the expedition rapidly improved, the

climate and scenery were invigorating, with an abundant flora and

fauna. There Avere here obtained roots and seeds of the shrubby gentian

{Exacum cceruleum), one of the most lovely species both in flower and

foliage of a beautiful family, and of a fine broad-leaved amaryllid (Hceinan-

thus gratidifolius), whose flowering is awaited with much expectation.
    On January 27 a move was made from Homhil to Adho Dimellus, in

the heart of the Haghier Mountains, at about 4,000 feet above sea-level

one of the most salubrious and beautiful spots imaginable. There over a

fortnight was spent with great profit to all departments of the collection.

Numerous butterflies were captured, some of great rarity, such as Papilio

benetti, of which only one broken specimen was previously known,

as well as roots and seeds of some of the most remarkable of the plants

of the island, whose alpine flora has all the marks of great antiquity.

On February 18 the expedition had to make its way back to the plain of

Hadibu to await the return of the Eljyhinstone, which on the 21st of the

saiue month anchored off" the town, and took on board the members of

the expedition and the collections. The same evening the despatch-boat

sailed for Abd-el-Kuri, where it was decided to supplement the collections

already obtained there by a few days' further exploration. From Abd-el-

Kuri the Elphinstone brought the expedition direct to Aden, arriving

there on the night of February 26, 1899. The party left Aden on

March 2, and sixteen days later arrived in London.
    The results of the expedition may be summarised as follows : Of

mammals there are examples of one or two species of rat, of one species
of civet cat, of one species of bat, and of a beautiful wild ass, which may

perhaps prove to be a new species. Of birds there are some 300 speci-

mens, 250 in skin and fifty in spirit; out of which seven species have
Abeen described by Mr. Grant and Dr. Forbes as new to science.
                                                                large

series of reptiles, described by Mr. Bouleiiger, was acquired, which con-

tains one genus and eight species new to herpetology. Of the scorpions,
millepedes, and spiders obtained, Mr. Pocock has described one new genus
and seven new species in the former group, and one new genus and four

new species in the latter. Of the land-shells (numbering several thou-
sands), Mr. Edgar Smith has described eight species as new to his depart-

ment of zoology. Of insects there are several thousands, and Mr. Ogilvie-

Grant has described three new butterflies, one of them a very beautiful
and large charaxes (C. velox), while Sir George Hampson has diagnosed
one new genus and fourteen new species of moths. Mr. Burr, who has
examined the Orthoptera, describes two new genera and six new species

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

while Mr. Kirkaldy has described the whole of the species of Hemiptera

as new to science. Professor B. Balfour, F.R.S., of Edinburgh, reports

that the plants, of which living specimens or ripe seeds, over 200 in

number, have been brought home, are of great scientific interest. Their

 cultivation is being kindly undertaken by him in the Royal Botanical

I

 Gardens at Edinburgh. Among the most interesting may be mentioned

 species of Dorstenia, Adenium, Begonia, Crinum, Exacum, Ruellia, Den-

I

[drosicyos, Hcemanthus, Helichrysum, with Punica j)'^otopunica and

\j)rac(Bna cinnabari.

      The true Sokoteri of the mountains, the Mahri, were found to be

 a light-complexioned Mahomedan people only poorly civilised, living in

I

 caves or rude cyclopean huts, who possess but few utensils, implements,

or ornaments, and almost no weapons. The ethnographical collections

 are  consequently  very  small ;  still, there have been brought back

i

.specimens of their pottery, of their primitive quernlike mills, of their

I basket-work, and of their weaving apparatus. The expedition has like-
 wise brought back and deposited in the British Museum two large blocks

j

 of stone inscribed with an ancient script, which may perhaps throw some

light on the language of the people who occupied the island in a past age,

and of whose cyclopean remains interesting photographs have been

obtained.

   --In addition to the biological collections in which six new genera
--and sixty-seven new species have been already described a number of

geological specimens were brought together, which have been examined

by Dr. Gregory, whose report will shortly be published.

      Every day also a meteorological register was kept, and trigonometrical

and astronomical observations conducted by Dr. Forbes. From the latter
a new map of the island will be constructed.

      The results of the expedition, in regard to the question of geographical

distribution, add little to what the investigations of Balfour, Schwein-

furth, and Riebeck have established ; but several of the zoological species
confirm the presence of a distinct American element in the biology of the

island, which appears to have reached this now isolated area by way of

an antarctic land, the existence of which is greatly confirmed by the

recent discovery in Patagonia of Meiolania, originally described from
Lord Howe's Island.

      It will not be out of place here to place on record the liberality and

public-spirited action of the Museums Committee of the Liverpool City

Council in taking part in the exploration of Sokotra, and the great credit
which unquestionably belongs to it of having been the first in the provinces

to recognise that it was within the duty of a great corporation to further

in this way the advancement and increase of knowledge by actively

sharing in the investigation of little-knosvn regions.

       II. By Mr. H. J. Chaney

In 1882 a Committee was appointed by the Association to determine a

o-auce for the manufacture of the various small screws used in telegraphic

and electrical apparatus, in clockwork, and for other analogous purposes.

GThis Committee reported to Section in the succeeding years 1883, 1884,

and proposed that a certain system of screw-threads, since known as the
British Association screw-threads, should be recommended for adoption
by users of small screws in this country. The system is identical except
in one small point with that used in Switzerland and associated with
the name of Professor M. Thury. The series consists of 26 threads,
numbered 0-25, having diameters from 6mm. down to ·25mm., and is so-

closely graduated that only in exceptional cases can any size be required
intermediate between two of the set. The form of the thread has proved
to be well adapted for practical purposes, and screws made on this system
have come into extensive use among English manufacturers of small
mechanical apparatus. It has been adopted by several Government

Departments, who have imposed its use upon their contractoi'S.
     In the year 1895 representations were made to the Section, and some

correspondents of the Technical papers urged, that the value of this system

was prejudiced by the fact that purchasers of British Association screws
and screwing-tools could not rely on obtaining from manufacturers goods
which were interchangeable with one another. This raised at once a
question which had not been closely considered by the 1882 Committee

viz., the mode of determining whether any given screw of a particular
number is or is not a fair representation of the form laid down by the
British Association specification. The present Committee were appointed
at the Ipswich Meeting to deal with this point, and with some additional

members have sat at intervals up to the present time.

    GIn 1896 an interim report was presented to Section at the Liverpool

Meeting, in which the problem of the mode of gauging small screws was
discussed at length. The piincipal conclusion reached at that time was

that as no means exists of examining a nut or female screw, the efforts of
the Committee should be dir<-cted to obtaining accurate plug or male screws

for use as gauges, and combs or chasers.
     During the three years that have elapsed since this report was made
           ON THE SMALL SCREW GAUGE.                465

the Committee have been in communication witli diftei-eiit firms, and

principally with the Pratt and Whitney Company of Hartford, U.S.A., a

firm enjoying the very highest reputation for work of the kind the

Committee desii-ed to secure. Finding that this firm were prepared to

undertake the production of gauges and tools for the British Association

screw-threads on the same lines as they have adopted with the American

and Whitworth threads, the Committee have been satisfied to leave the

matter in the hands of the Company till they should ascertain whether

they could produce the desired result, and have given them all the

information, specifications, Asc, that were possible. Within the last two

months the Pratt and Whitney Company have submitted to the Committee

specimens in hard steel of male and female gauge pieces of threads Nos. 3,
7, and 13. The three male screws of these sets have been photographed

by Colonel Watkin on a large scale, and have been measured by Mr.

H. J. Chaney, Superintendent of the Standards Department of the Board

of Trade. Their two reports are printed below.

     The Committee believe these gauges to be sufliciently accurate for

--practical requirements. The material of which they are made hardened
--steel should enable them to stand much use without injury. Their finish

and general workmanship are exceedingly good.

The Committee, through their Secretary, have expressed to the Pratt

and Whitney Company their satisfaction with these gauges, and have

been informed in reply that a higher degree of accuracy may be expected

in the future. They are still in correspondence respecting the specifica-

tions of limits of error and other details concerning their production on

the commercial scale. The manufacture and sale of these gauges by the

--Pratt and Whitney Company appear to realise the object set before them-

selves by the Committee viz., to assist the extension of the use of the

British Association system of screw-threads by making generally available

accurate means for their verification.

While recognising the excellence of the form of the British Associa-

tion screw-thread for mechanical purposes, the Committee feel strongly

that the difficulty of producing the form to the degree of accuracy desirable

for the best class of work, and especially for gauge pieces, is a serious

drawback to its value. Colonel Watkin's photographs show very clearly that

the best appliances in the most experienced hands that the Committee

could find have failed to produce even single specimens of first- rate accu-

racy. The letters addressed to the Secretary of the Committee by Mr.

George M. Bond, manager of the standards and gauge department of the

Pratt and Whitney Company, as well as the high reputation of his firm,

leave no room for doubt that very great care has been taken to secure
Aaccuracy in these specimens.
                               considerable number of gauges made by

English firms of good standing have been examined by the Committee,
and have in every case shown errors of the same character as, though
usually to a much greater degree than, the specimens submitted by the
American firm.

    From several .sources, and especially in Mr. Bond's letters, it has been

urged on the Committee that although the difficulties of constructing

these gauges of a very high degree of accuracy are practically insuperable,

screw-threads of a fiat-ended form can be produced with great exactness.

A photDgraph taken by Colonel Watkin of a fine screw taken from an

instrument made by Messrs. Brown and Sharpe shows that this is certainly

the case.

4^66 REPORT--1899.

     The American, or flai,-ended, form of thread appears to be rapidly
establishing itself in. France and Germany, judging from the reports we
have received of the French and Zurich Conferences, and we understand
that it is entirely employed by the French Admiralty and by several of
the French raiJway companies. These reports refer, it is true, to screws

of larger sizes than are included in the range of the British Association
and Professor Thury's systems. The conclusions of the recent Conference
at Zurich, which adopted the flat-ended thread, were expressly limited to

screws of more than 6 mm. diameter, the extreme upper limit of our
system. Buv so far as the easy production of accurate form is concerned,

arguments which apply to large screws apply with greater force to small

screws ; while a form which is suitable for all screws above 6 mm. cannot

be wholly unsuitable for screws below that limit. The Committee, more-
over, were informed by one of their number that he has used screws of the
American form in sizes corresponding with some of the smaller numbers
of the British Association series, and has found them perfectly satis-

factory.

     Current conceptions of the possible and desirable limits of accuracy in
mechanical consti'uction are rapidly advancing, and while we recognise
the value of tlie work of the Committee of 18S2 in establishing a generally
accepted thread, we are dissatisfied with a standard form for a piece so
important as a screw whicli is open to the sei-ious objection referred to

above.

   We recommend that this Committee shall be reappointed for the pur-

pose of considering whether the British Association form of thread for
small screws should be modified.

The Secretary British Association. Screw Gauge Committer.

    I have now taken photographs of the screws sent by the Pratt and
Whitney Company for the Committee, prints of which I enclose.

    I find the general forms of these screws are better than those we have

obtained heretofore, which is satisfactory, taking into consideration the
fact that they are constructed of hard steel.

    As in former cases, the larger sizes conform more nearly to the British

Association pattern thread, the rounding in the smaller sizes being not

quite so satisfactory.

The angle of the thread in the two large .sizes is about 49", but con-

siderably more in the No. 13 size.

As regards linear dimensions, all the sci-ews are nearly perfect, as will

be seen by the measurements given on the back of the photographs.

The diagonal scale accompanying the photographs was constructed

from the scale photographed at the same time as the screws.

The gauges may, I think, be accepted as sufficiently correct for all

practical purposes as standard gauges for British Association pattern

screws.                             (Signed) W, Watkin.

   II. Report from Mr. H. J. Chaney, Superintendent of the Standards
                             Department of the Board of Trade.

                                          Standards Department, Board of Trade : July 10, 1899.

   My --dear Sir, I have now the pleasure to enclose, for the informa-

tion of Sir William Preece, a statement showing the external dimensions

of the three male screws which you forwarded to me on Thursday last,

and which have been returned to-day by registered post. The dimensions
were determined by contact comparisons (made by independent observers)
of the screws with Board of Trade Standard cylindrical gauges, plane-
gauges, and wire gauges ; and in the case of the smallest screw (c), by

mici'oscopic comparison with a linear standard.

    Had time allowed, a more exhaustive examination of the three screws-

might have been made ; but the present comparison may, I suggest, be

±relied on to O'OOOi inch. The dimensions given in the enclosed paper

(4"1023 mm., 0"16151 inch, &c.) are in each case the mean external
diameter of the whole length of the screw, and show that although A and

c have perhaps appreciable errors, the required dimensions have generally
been closely followed by Mr. Bond. The screw-threads are in fact, in
our opinion, of excellent workmanship ; but it is doubtful Avhether the

screws are always perfectly cylindrical. For instance, the mean external

diameter of the last eight threads of screw c (or the point of the screw)

is 0-008 mm. greater than the external diameter of the fifteen

middle threads of c. The external diameter of the seven last threads,
(shoulder of the screw) of c agree in measurement with the diameter o£

the point of the screw.

    I should much like to see a copy of Colonel Watkin's photographs.
                                                            Yours faithfully,

470 REPOKT-- 1899.

forty-five years Parisians walking along the Champs-Elysees dispensed

with the view of Les Invalides without complaint, proving that it is much

better to hide entirely a tine view than to spoil it.
     In addition to the foregoing festhetical considerations, the engineers

were aware it was the wish of people navigating the Seine that there
should be no pier in the r-iver bed, the widest possible fairway under the
bridge, and that consequently the least thickness admissible must be
belected for the central part of the frame of the bridge.

   --General Dimensions of the Bridge. The bridge consists of a single

very flat arch, the flooring of which is prolonged over either bank by small
viaducts, the total length of the bridge between the parapets of the
banks being 155 metres (509 feet). The abutments of the central arch

are 109 metres (357 feet) apart.

     The longitudinal axis of the bridge coincides with the axis of the new

avenue crossing the Seine at an angle of 83^ 38'. Its width, 40 metres
(131 feet), had to harmonise with that of its approaches, the widest bridge
in Paris up to the present being only 30 metres (98 feet) ; London Bridge is
54 feet, the Tower Bridge 60 feet, and Brooklyn Bridge 86 feet in width.

     The whole width of the bridge is divided into a central roadway of
20 metres in width, and into two equal pavements of 10 metres each.

     The gradient of the roadway is 1 in 50, and the highest part of it is
situated at such a level that an observer standing near the Champs-Elysees
in the prolongation of the axis on the right bank will be able to see the

base of the Hotel des Invalides.
     For reasons which have been already mentioned, the coeflicient of rise

and the thickness of the central cross-section have been reduced to the
least possible dimensions. The rate of rise to .span is 1 to 17. The
thickness of the central cross section from the bottom flange of the arcb
to the top of the wooden paving on the part of the roadway nearest the
pavement is no more than r02 metres (3 feet 4 inches).

     The conditions obtained for navigation, in consequence of the extreme
flatness of the arch, though they do not fulfil the wishes of those most
interested, and are in fact not quite satisfactory at the present time, must
be considered as acceptable. The width of the fairway left is no less than
65 metres (213 feet) in the ordinary state of the river, and 34'4 metres (113-

feet) at high-water time ; the iieight of free passage being 5-50 metres (18
feet) above the water level. Moreover the practical inconveniences of the

present situation may be corrected in the future by the suppression of

one of the piers of the Invalides Bridge, through the arches of which tugs

and barges going down tlie river cannot pass without some ditiiculty.
     The characteiistic features of the new bridge when compared witli

existing bridges may be expressed in these few words : Alexander III.

Bridge is the widest, the flattest, the thinnest skew-arch bridge ever

constructed in France. By what means have the engineers provided for
the stability of such a bridge, and how have they erected it without

interfering with the navigation 1 These two elements of the j^roblem are^
so intimately connected, that it is not possible to separate tliem ; both had
an equal influence on the choice of the type of the arch.

     The bridge consists of flfteen equally distant three-hinged arches, the
elements of which have been made of cast steel connected by screw-bolts.
The flooring rests either through the medium of upright pillars, or directly
on the top of the arches

     The peculiarities of the triple-hinged aixh appeared at once to be
                                                         '

obviously adequate to the various conditions of the problem. The moments

of flexure being almost independent of the temperature in such arches,
and only becoming a little important near the articulations, it is possible
to reduce the thickness of the section in the central part, more than in
any other system, without any inconvenience. It is equally possible, by
a judicious distribution of the metal, to prevent changes in the direction

of the stresses, which are always well known in this system, and to obtain

a sort of steel vault in which every part of the metal is compressed under
all circumstances. The joints of the elements of the arches or voussoirs

have not to be riveted, and may be made with screw-bolts. There is,

moreover, no objection to the use of cast steel, so that the operations left
to be carried out on the works for mounting the ribs are very few,
provided sufficient preparatory care has been taken.

      It was easy, on account of the suppression of riveting, not only to
erect each rib in a short time, but also to erect them successively with
the help of a moving system so as to secure the fairway wanted for navi-

gation during the whole time of erection.

   --Foundations. On account of the flatness of the arches the thrust is

very considerable, though it is not greater in proportion than in many
arch bridges made of masonry. It amounts to 288 tons for each metre

--in length of the abutments about 12,700 tons for each abutment.

     The subsoil of the valley of the Seine is not to be compared with the
regular subsoil of the Thames in London, where engineers are sure to find
an excellent water-tight, hard, uniform clay. The strata in the subsoil
in the southern part of Paris have a general gradient towards the hills at
Meudon, so that the bridges over the river have been built with all kinds
of subsoil for foundations. Whilst, for example, the ' Pont Neuf,' the
' Pont de la Concorde,' and other bridges of the centre of Paris have been
erected on the solid calcareous bed-rocks belonging to the Lutetian
strata, the 'Pont des Invalides ' stands on sand, the ' Pont de I'Alma
on soft clay, the ' Pont de Jena ' and the ' Passerelle de Passy ' on hard

clay, the ' Pont Mirabeau ' on chalk.

    When foundations are laid upon calcareous rock or on chalk,

engineers agree on their being perfectly stable, but when the foundations
are to rest upon the intermediate strata of sand or clay, precautions must

be taken, because these strata lack regularity in depth and, in the case of
the clay, in firmness, so that works resting on it run the risk of settlement.

      It was decided that the foundations should be built as if they were to
be supported by the worst strata of Parisian subsoil. Therefore the
 pressure on the bottom ground was limited to three kg. per square
 centimetre (about 40 lb. per square inch), and the weight of each abut-
 ment was fixed at such an amount that it could resist the thrust by the
 friction of the ground alone, without depending in any way on the earth

 backing.

      It is easy to see that no result satisfactory for both conditions could
 be obtained without developing to a great extent the surface of the

 abutments, the back parts of which were carried to a distance of
 33-50 metres (110 feet) from the front part in the river bed.

      Each abutment consists, in consequence, of an enormous block of
 solid masonry in the form of a parallelogram 44 metres (144 feet) in
 length (along the river) and 33'50 metres in width, its surface area being

 1,474 square metres (15,850 square feet).

      The right abutment has been sunk to a depth of 8-25 metres (27 feet)
472 HEPORT--1899.

under the regular water level, and the left abutment to a depth of
7*50metres (24^ feet) according to indications from soundings.

     The rear part of each one was left hollow and filled with sand.
     Foundations of such a size are quite beyond the proportions com-
monly used even for bridges over vei-y large rivers ; but the unfavourable
conditions have been so great, namely, width of the bridge, flatness of
arches, and character of subsoil, that the foundations of this modest 350 feet
single span come into comparison for size with those of its older brothers,
the Brooklyn Bridge, the Forth Bridge, and the magnificent Tower

Bridge.

     Each abutment was put in place by means of a single pneumatic
caisson. The frame of the caisson, entirely made of mild steel, consisted

of a vertical water-tight wall 3-68 metres (12 feet) in height, encircling the
whole surface of the foundation, and of a horizontal equally water-tight
partition at about 1 -DO metres (6 feet 3 inches) above the lowest level of
the wall.

    This partition was the roof of the working space. As it was designed
to sustain a heavy load of masonry while the caisson was sinking, the

steel sheets (5 millimetres thick) which form the water-tight ceiling of the
caisson were reinforced by two systems of girders perpendicular in

direction.

     Below the ceiling four partitions or supporting girders divided the
working space into five sections or I'ooms, communicating with each other
through the central latticed parts of the girders.

     These four partitions and the walls were fitted with solid edge cutters
at the bottom, and with angle brackets.

     Above the I'oof a set of twenty-seven latticed beams 1"60 metres (.5 feet
6 inches) in height were laid at right angles to the girders just described.

     These beams were arranged to support the load of concrete while the
space between them was being filled, and to contribute to the rigidity of
the roof after the concrete had turned into a solid mass.

     Each of the five rooms of the working space was furnished with two
entrance wells, provided with air locks and engines for lifting excavated

materials.

     The contractors, in order to save time, erected these wells or shafts at
the start with the total length which would be requii-ed at the end of the
sinking, and so they were forced to erect a wooden scafiblding twenty-
five feet in height over the whole surface of the caisson.

     The caissons were rapidly and successfully sunk. The contractors
received orders to commence work in April 1897 ; the sinking was begun
on the first day of August, and finished at the beginning of November on
the right bank ; begun in January 1898 and finished in the middle of
March on the left bank. The work with compressed air lasted seventy-
nine days on the right bank, and seventy-one on the left one.

      It would be fruitless to deny that in spite of the great abilities of the
                                                    --

contractors, Messrs. Letellier and Boutrinquieu, in spite of the intelli-
gence displayed by the inspectors, who had great experience of compressed
air work (especially in connection with the late Pont Mirabeau), the engi-
neers were somewhat anxious about the success of the operation of sinking
the caissons, never attempted before in such conditions and on such a scale. ^

    Great precautions were taken to insure regularity. Among the other

·difficulties encountered were those due to the variable resistance of the
soil and to the presence in it of stones and piles belonging to the old
demolished suspension bridge and to the foundations of the quay.

      Frequent observations on the flexure of the metallic frame were
considered to be the most convenient means to prevent the caisson from
breaking. For this purpose a general water-level pipe was placed in the
working space, so fitted that at every instant the inspector could state
the flexure of walls and main girders. Moreover, daily observations were

made in the open air to ascertain the true situation of the caisson.

    When the caisson reached the proper depth the surface beneath it

consisting of large calcareous flagstones on the right bank and of sand on

--the left one was cleaned and levelled and the working space was filled

with concrete. The five rooms of each caisson were successively filled,
the men retreating from one to another so that electric lighting could be

maintained to the end.
     The caissons were sunk and filled with concrete, and the backing

constructed of heavy stone masonry laid in cement. The facings of the
abutments on the river side were made of courses of hammered ashlar
of cut granite stones ; lastly, five granite courses were put behind the

sockets perpendicular to the direction of the thrust, their surface increasing

in size, so that the ordinary masonry in connection with the last one bears
a crushing stress only of about 18 kilogrammes per square centimetre (2521b.
per square inch), while the granite-bearing stones in connection with the
sockets have to resist about 48 kilogrammes per square centimetre (7801b.
per square inch).

   --Temporary Works Rolling Bridge. The moving system designed for

the erection of the arches consisted really of a steel riveted bridge of
120 metres in length supported above the level of Alexander III. bridge

by framework of pyramidal shape, the whole forming a gigantic
travelling crane rolling on double sets of rails fixed on the upper part of

the abutments.

     This apparatus was arranged to support the load of centreings and
arches, and also to carry the centreings to their successive situations and

to secure a convenient platform for handling the arch pieces.

     As the necessities of navigation did not require a temporary passage

more than 50 metres (164 feet) in width, the contractors for the metallic
part of the Avork were allowed to mount the side parts of the arches near
the springings on wooden centreings supported by piles in such a manner
that they could be moved by slipping with the central part of the
·centreings fixed to the rolling bridge. In this way it was possible to
relieve this temporary bridge of a large part of the load, and also to
sustain its trusses at two intermediate points by metallic columns resting
on rows of piles while the arches were being erected. The rolling bridge
had generally in consequence three spans, two of 33-50 metres (110 feet)

      ' The engineers to the Port du Havre, encouraged by this success, have projected
to sink caissons of more than 22,000 square feet, through the bad soil they have

 to deal with.

--474 REPORT 1899.

in length for the side spans, and one of 53 metres (174 feet) for the centre.
It had a single span of 120 metres (410 feet) only while being moved.

     The structure of the temporary bridge was erected on the right bank
of the river and launched so that the channel left for boats was never
encumbered and navigation not once interrupted. As the total length
the contractors had at their disposal for the launching platform was only
about 60 metres, it was necessary to proceed in three steps. The first
portions having been delivered in the middle of July, the first launching
was made on August 20, the second on September 8, the last one on the
30th of the same month.

     The centreings of the bridge were completed and ready to be used at
the beginning of November.

     The steel voussoirs were cast at five difierent steel works, each of
which received orders for a certain number of arches to be delivered in

succession :

Chatillon & Commentry steel works  . . . Four arches.

St. Chamond steel works . . . . . . ,, ,,

Creusot steel works                Three ,,

St. Etienne steel works            Two ,,

Firminy steel works                ,

Before being delivered each arch was mounted in the manufacturer's shop

in halves. On a plain solid platform made of concrete or of timber the

exact shape of a half- arch was drawn with the utmost precaution ; one of
the most experienced inspectors went through the five shops to examine
these drawings, to compare them with the contemplated dimensions, and

to note the conditions of their structure.

    When it was found that the drawings were satisfactory in every

respect, and identical with each other, the different voussoirs of each half-
arch were placed upon them and connected.

     In this way, when leave was given to deliver the voussoirs, the engi-
neers were assured that no difficulty would arise in the course of the
operations of erection. They were right in so thinking, because it only
once happened that an operation was interrupted on account of a joint

table not being truly planed.

     The first operation made i7i situ was the exact measurement of the
distance between the abutments, which was effected very easily by means
of the rolling bridge itself considered as a gauge. The measurements
made in this way mi sitit for every arch allowed every thrust stone to be

properly cut beforehand with satisfactory exactness.
     The travelling bridge had been fitted with four trucks running on

two elevated systems of rails above the place where the arches were to
be erected. Each truck was pulled by a chain from the extremity of
the bridge above the abutment to its central part, and could stop at any
intermediate point. The load hung from the truck by means of pulleys
and cable, so that it could be kept up or down at any height. Cables and
chains were moved by means of steam winches at each extremity of the

travelling bridge according to the orders communicated.

     In this way, when the orders were carefully given by the foreman to
the engine-drivers, the workmen had scarcely any trouble ; the handling

required only a certain cleverness in the operation of keeping together

the corresponding bolt-holes by means of crowbars, while each voussoir
was slowly slipping along the next one that had just been erected.
       ON THE ERECTION OF ALEXANDER III. BRIDGE IN PARIS.                                                 475

     The time necessary to hold a voussoir, to present, and to connect it to
the next one, and also to secure it with oak wedges, was only about ten

minutes. The successive operations were really a little longer because it
was not possible, within ten minutes, to clean the surfaces of the table-

joint from the coat of paint which kept them from rusting. Nevertheless,

as every half-arch consisted only of sixteen voussoirs, two sets of six
workmen with good foremen easily connected up two arches within two

days.

During the work of connection the foreman noted with a gauge that

the arches were at the proper distance, so that when it was completed the

direction of each half-arch was almost correct. But as it was indispensable

on account of the necessity both of assuring a good transmission of the

enormous thrust and of mounting the flooring, which was manufactured

in shops at a great distance from the steel foundries, to get a very high

degree of exactness in the setting of the arches, the chief erector accu-

rately provided for it. When by small removals, obtained by means

of crowbars and wedges, he judged the arches to have been brought in

their proper places, when the inspectors had stated that the spring-

ing articulations were at the proper level, that the two parts of

each arch were exactly in the prolongation of each other, and that the

sockets were satisfactorily in connection with the pins, then the thrust

sockets were sealed in the thrust-stones with liquid cement forced into

the joint.

Four days after they were filled, the cement joints were fast enough

to support the thrust of the arches, so that it was possible to take away

the centreings.

In spite of the precautions taken at the steel works, the engineers did

not rely on the measurements made at a distance for the regulation of the

arches                                        they had purposely arranged the length of the voussoirs to  be  in
                                           ;

the total three centimetres (one inch) shorter than the arches, the difference

being filled in by sheets of rolled steel placed at the joints of each of the

Atwo central socket voussoirs.                sufficient number of rolled steel sheets of

various thicknesses having been cut beforehand, drilled and prepared, it
was possible to fit at once, by a proper combination of them, joints of any

required thickness.

The last operation to be described is the method of removing the

centreings from the arches.

The processes commonly used for such operations did not seem satis-

factory because the stresses developed in the supports as well as in the

arches could not be well known, and it was equally inconvenient, even

--dangerous, both to develop extension stresses in the arches for which
--the joints were not made and to bring the loads in the central part of

the rolling bridge to an excessive amount. Moreover, it was indispensable

to secure the possibility of putting the arches again in connection with the

centreings, in order to change, if necessary, the size of a regulating joint.

It was decided on these accounts that the operation should be completed

by means of screw cranes, and that the screw cranes should be dynamo-

metric. The screws were fitted with Belleville washer springs constructed

by Schneider cfe Co.

The time required for the successive operations should have been

160 days                                      it was really six months and a half,  from the end of November
                                          ;

to June 9. The increase in the time was only due to the delay in deliver-

ing metal for the upper part of the bridge, on account of which the
476 REPORT--1899.

·operation of mounting the arches was interrupted in the month of

·January.

     Some peculiarities of the metallic structure in connection with the
use of cast steel, and the flatness and the width of the bridge, present a

certain interest of novelty.

     As the steel- makers deemed it important for the good and cheap

·casting of the voussoirs that the thickness of all parts of them should be
as uniform as possible, the surfaces of the webs and of the top and bottom
flanges have been designed to be plain without any hook or prominent
block. Only a few bearings, obtained by planing at places an extra thick-
ness of ten or twelve millimetres, were allowed besides the stays stiffening
the webs and flanges.

      As, moreover, the bridge is skew, there is no correspondence between
the stays of the consecutive ribs, and, therefore, no possibility of using
them for the necessary connections between the ribs.

     For these reasons the voussoirs have been arranged to be held only by
the top flange, and they have been stiffened in consequence by strong
joint tables and two main stays. Near the springings, cast steel shoes

fixed at the base of the upright pillars grasp the top flange of the

voussoirs properly planed and drilled at these points ; bolts keep the shoes
from slipping along the flanges. The upright pillars being connected
together by means of horizontal and cross bars, the shoes are strongly
maintained at the required distance.

     In the central part, on account of the want of height, the top flanges
of the voussoirs are held by the beams of the flooring. This arrange-
ment, which the engineers could not help making use of, was somewhat
troublesome. In consequence of it the structure of the flooring required
the most careful designing ; the distance from the top of the arches to
the top of the beams being extremely variable, and according with no
simple law on account of the convexity of the flooring and of the obliquity
of the beams to the direction of the axis of the river, the joints connect-
ing the beams with the arches have been necessarily made in the most
various ways, the number being no less than 173.

     The last peculiarity I have to mention to you concerns the precautions
taken on account of the transversal expansion, which is not to be neg-
lected on a length of 40 metres (141 feet). It was found that the stresses

developed in the arches near the springings in consequence of the expan-
sion of the rigid beams in which the top flanges were inserted by the
aforesaid cast steel shoes, could rise at a dangerous rate. Consequently,
the three sets of beams near the springings have been supplied with

expansion joints made of Belleville spring washers, so that the stresses
transmitted by the horizontal bars of the beams are limited.

     The test requirements for the steel do not present anything of special
interest. The steel has been divided into four grades :

     Steel for angles and plates grade I.
                                                                                                                            ;

      Steel for rivets grade II.
                                                                                         ;

      Steel castings for voussoirs grade III.
                                                                                                                               ;

     Hammered steel for pins grade IV.
                                                                                                                      ;

     All steel castings have been thoroughly annealed. The tests required
for this part of the work concerned not only tensile strength, but also
power to resist shocks.

     The required conditions and the most interesting results are shown in

ithe following tables :

     The total weight of masonry used in the foundations is about 36,400

tons for each abutment.

     The total weight of steel required for the erection of the bridge
amounted to 5,400 tons. About 4,330 tons are included in the metallic
frame of the bridge, 670 tons are incorporated in the foundations, and
400 tons was used for the temporary rolling bridge. (Exactly 5,481,

     Decoration of the Bridye. I have now completed the description of

the engineering features of this bridge, but it is impossible to leave the
subject of the erection of Alexander III. Bridge without saying some
words about its decoration.

     It was decided, at the outset, that the entrances of the bridge should
be fitted with ornaments of an architectural style, harmonising with the
adjacent Palaces of Fine Arts. The design and the erection of these
monumental pillars, as well as the preparation of the designs for the
·ornamental details of the bridge, were the special task of the architects.

     The work was entrusted to Messrs. Cassieu Bernard and Cousin, dis-
tinguished architects, who sent in remarkable designs for the Exhibition,
and were consequently selected for co-operating in an important part of it.

     The ornaments of the external ribs consist of a frieze fixed upon the
curved webs of the ribs, and of a decorative portico which covers the rolled
steel spandril uprights. This portico is fitted with garlands and masks, and
it is crowned with a moulded cornice. The cornice itself is surmounted
by a balustrade, which is the guard-rail of the bridge. Frieze, portico,
garlands, masks, cornice, and balusters are made of cast iron.

      Directly above the pillars of the portico bronze lamp-posts are inserted
in the balustrade, the upper part of which is of bronze.

     This ornamental system is completed by three great hammered copper
cartouches hanging from the balustrade at the thi-ee articulation points.
The central one is the most important, being supported by two female

figures of about three times life-size.
      All the ornaments have been carefully designed, the decorative elements

being chiefly studies from aquatic animals or plants. The best French
sculptors were asked to co-operate in the designs of the monumental
pillars at the entrances, and nothing has been spared to secure an excellent

·artistic effect.

     More than twenty engineers attended the preparatory meeting, at
which the steel-makers undertook to try the use of cast steel as arranged
by the authors of the design ; they afforded great help, tlie fruit of their
wide experience, in fixing the most convenient shapes of the voussoirs.

     Messrs. Pill6 and Dayde, assisted by M. Gilliard, designed and con-
structed the caissons for Messrs. Letellier and Boutrinquieu, general
contractors for the masonry woi'ks.

     M. Lautracq, chief engineer to the firm Fives of Lille, one of the con-
tractors for the steel-work, and his assistants designed the somewhat
complicated framework of the bridge.

     Messrs. Schmidt and Rochebois, engineers to Schneider & Co., the

other contractor for the steel-work, specially designed the rolling bridge

and carried out the operations for erecting the bridge with the help of
their very clever chief erector, M. Camus.

     To these names I need onlj' add the name of the firm Durenne, to

whom the ornamental part of the cast iron was entrusted.

      I will finally mention our inspectors, Messrs. Boucher, Lavallez,

Griniaud, and Retraint, distinguished members of the French ' Corps des

Conducteurs des Fonts et Chaussees,' amongst whom engineers are sure to

find, in all circumstances, the truest assistance and, what is more, friendly

companionship.

    Many obstacles have been mastered, but the trials are not yet over,

and the battle is not yet won. I was very ill at ease as to the success of
the bridge when I accepted the kind and gratifying invitation that I

should prepare this paper ; I am still rather anxious, but I hope soon to
be free of this anxiety, and next year when you come to see the Exhibition

I trust to have the pleasure of showing you the completed bridge in its

bright artistic dress.

       Dover Harbour Worhs. By J. C. CoODE, M.Inst.C.E., and
                         W. Matthews, M.Inst.C.E.

                 [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.}

                                                       [PLATE.]

Many interesting records, extending back more than 400 years, still exist

of works proposed and executed for the formation and improvement of the
harbour at Dover ; necessarily these older records apply chiefly to works
on the sites now occupied by the Tidal Harbour and the Wellington and
Granville Docks.

     The history of the port is dealt with in a special chapter of the Guide
Book issued by this Association, and it is therefore now proposed to refer
only to a few of the steps which, more directly, have led to the adoption
of the important works at present under construction.

     In the year 1840, a Royal Commission was appointed to survey the

harbours of the south-east coast.
      It is on this occasion unnecessary to quote the recommendations of

the Commission with regard to other ports, but with reference to Dover
they remarked :

      ' This harbour, as the principal port of communication between Great
Britain and the Continent, has been regarded at all times as a place of
the greatest importance.'

     It may be of interest to quote here a somewhat similar but more

detailed opinion given by Sir AValter Raleigh in a memorial presented to
Queen Elizabeth in the year 1580 :

     ' No promontory, town, or haven, in Christendom, is so placed by

nature and situation, both to gratify friends, and annoy enemies, as this
town of Dover ; no place is so settled to receive and deliver intelligence
for all matters and actions in Europe, from time to time ; no town is by
nature so settled, either to allure intercourse by sea, or to train
inhabitants by land, to make it great, fair, rich, and populous ; nor is
there in the whole circuit of this famous island any port, either in respect
of security or defence, or of traffic or intercourse, more convenient, need-
ful, or rather of necessity to be regarded, than this of Dover, situated on
a promontory next fronting a puissant foreign king, and in the very
streight, passage, and intercourse of almost all the shipping in Christendom.'

      Having completed their inspections, the Commissioners reported as

 follows :
----  --

480 REPORT-- 1899.

     ' The situation which appears to us of the greatest importance, and at
the same time affords the most eligible position for a deep-water harbour,
is Dover Bay. Independently of its proximity to the Continent, this bay
possesses considerable advantages ; the depth of water at 400 yards from
the shore is two fathoms at low water of spring tides, and but six fathoms at
1,100 yards, which therefore affords sufficient width for the construction of
a capacious deep-water harbour, without getting into such a depth for the
site of the piers or breakwater as would greatly add to the expense of

the works.'

     The works recommended by the Commissioners were indicated on a
large cartoon, which was exhibited to the Section, by black lines, and
were described as follows :

     ' The principal feature of the proposed plan is a breakwater at the
average distance of 1,000 yards from the shore, with piers projected from
the land towaixls its eastern and western ends.'

     The area at low water enclosed within the works would have been
450 acres, of which 320 acres would have been seaward of the two-fathom
line. It was pointed out that either one entrance, or two entrances, could

--be provided as desired. The advantages of two entrances were stated

to be

     ' That vessels might enter or leave the harbour with the wind from
any quarter, and a ready access be afforded to the mouth of the present
harbour from the western entrance, without passing through the centre
of the new harbour.'

    On the other hand the provision of only one entrance in the middle of

the breakwater would have the advantage of rendering the interior of the
harbour in some degree more quiet. The Commissioners were in favour
of two entrances. The estimated cost of the works proposed was

2,000,000;.

     Chiefly on account of the terms of a report on shipwrecks made by a
Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1843, a further Royal
Commission was appointed in 1844 to consider :

     1st. Whether it was desirable that a harbour of refuge should be con-

structed in the Channel.

    2nd. What site would be the most eligible for such a harbour on

account of its combining in the greatest degree the following grounds of
preference :

     (a) That it should be of easy access at all times of tide to vessels
requiring shelter from stress of weather.

     (b) That it should be calculated for a station for armed vessels of war
in the event of hostilities, both for pui'poses of offence and defence ; and

     (c) That it should possess facilities for injuring its defence in the
event of an attack by the enemy.

     In reporting, the Commissioners agreed with their predecessors of
1840 in pronouncing a favourable opinion of Dover as a site for a harbour
of refuge, but gave special attention to the quality of the anchorage and

the liability of the harbour to silt up. At the instance of the Commis-
sioners, Captain Washington, in command of HM.S. Blazer, made

practical trials of the holding qualities of the anchorage, and reported in

--the following terms :
                                                     '

                 ON THE DOVEil HARfidtJR WORKS.  48l

     ' Thua the tough nature of the holding ground, so much better than,
from common report, I had anticipated, having disabled one anchor and
parted the cable from the other, and the fact of two large ships having

also parted their cables in recent gales, appeared to be decisive as to the
good quality of the anchorage, nor, after the trials I have witnessed,

should I have any hesitation in riding out a gale of wind in Dover Bay
in its present state ; how much less so when enclosed by a breakwater !

The probability of the deposit of silt in an enclosed harbour could not

be so definitely determined ; samples of water taken in various positions
and deptlis showed that the quantity of matter in suspension varied from
three to thirteen grains per cubic foot in calm weather, and from ten to
fifty-four grains in a strong S.W. breeze. The Commissioners were of
opinion that more extensive exjDcriments were necessary, and that these

should be continued for the space of a year, in all circumstances of

weather.

They submitted the design shown by purple lines on the cartoon, and,

pending further consideration of the general scheme, urged the immediate

commencement of ' that portion which is to commence at Cheeseman'a
Head.' For the information of visitors, it may be well to say that the
work thus described is that now generally known as the ' Admiralty Pier.'

     In the next year, i.e. 1845, a further Commission was appointed to
consider plans submitted by eight of the leading engineers of the day, and

reported that the form of the harbour should be practically that recom-

mended in the previous year.

Further observations on the quantity of silt held in suspension were

made, and the report pointed out that if liability to silt were deemed an

objection, it would be idle to attempt such works on any part of our coast.

To minimise the difficulty it was considered better to admit only the

quantity of water required to maintain the level in the harbour without

sensible current, than to permit a free tidal current which would sweep

through without causing a deposit.

As an instance supporting this contention, reference was made to

Kingstown, in Dublin Bay, where the harbour, although in the neighbour-

hood of numerous sandbanks, and with a single entrance in the fair line

of the tide, remained, after twenty years' experience, free from any per-

manent deposit.

     The only other point considered by this Commission to which reference
need now be made was the mode of construction. After receiving very

contradictory evidence, the system of upright walls was recommended in.

preference to sloping stone breakwaters.

    As a result of these inquiries and recommendations the contract for

the first portion of the Admiralty Pier was let in October 1847, and,

excepting only a small addition to its seaward end, it was completed in

1871. Its total length, including the turret, is about 2,000 feet, and the

general character of its construction was indicated on a diagram. It will

be universally admitted that, considered eitiier as an engineering structure

or as affording accommodation for an enormous passenger traffic, this pier

bears favourable comparison with any work of a similar character, and

reflects the greatest credit on its designers and builders.

    On only one occasion since its completion has any serious accident

occurred to the Admiralty Pier. This took place during an exceptionally

heavy gale on January 1, 1877, and was confined almost entirely to the

1899.                                            II

superstructure above quay-level. The damage was clearly due to the
thickness of the parapet, as originally designed by Messrs. "Walker and
Burgess, having been very largely reduced with a view to give greater

width for passenger platforms. At the time the pier was designed it was

not contemplated that it would be used for train service.

    Between the years 1869 and 1889 many designs were put forward for
the improvement of the port ; these need not be now considered, but it
may be of interest to note that a Committee appointed in 1881 to con-

sider certain questions relating to the employment of convicts in the
United Kingdom reported in favour of a continuation of the system under
which large public undertakings, such as the fortifications and breakwater
at Portland, the great basins at Chatham, and other similar works, had
been constructed. From all the schemes laid before them, the Committee
selected, on account of their magnitude, their importance from a national
point of view, and as well suited for the employment of prison labour :

     1. The construction of a pier and breakwater at Dover so as to form
with the Admiralty Pier a large harbour similar to that at Portland ; and

     2. The formation of a harbour of the same character at Filey in

Yorkshire.

     The large convict prison on the East Clifi* was constructed with the
intention of carrying out the recommendation of the Committee as regards
Dover, but, for several years, no further steps were taken (see Plate).

    On reference to the diagram, which was exhibited to the Section, it ia

seen that the Admiralty Pier must give fairly good accommodation for
landing and embarking even during ordinary gales from the S.W.
During exceptional storms, broken water is carried over the parapet, and
access to and landing from steamers is attended with risk. For use during
moderate winds from the E. and N.E., landing facilities have been provided
by the construction of stages on the western face of the pier. It is, however,
evident that with winds from the S.E., the pier is exposed on each face,
and serious delay and inconvenience have been thereby caused. To im-
prove the then existing conditions, the Dover Harbour Board in 1890
consulted the late Sir John Coode with a view to the construction of a
sheltered deep-water harbour.

     The work was sanctioned by Act of Parliament in 1891.
     The design recommended and adopted is shown on the Plate. The
scheme, for convenience of description and to distinguish it from the larger
national works, is frequently designated ' the Commercial Harbour,' and
will be so named whenever it is referred to in this paper.

    The sheltering works proposed were: (1) An Eastern Pier, running
about S.E. from the Clock Tower, and (2) An extension in an approxi-

mately eastern direction of the Admiralty Pier. The sheltered area which
would have been enclosed was 56 acres, and within this it was proposed
to reclaim an area of about 5 aci-es lying between the inner end of the
Admiralty Pier and the entr.ance to the e.visting Inner Harbour. From
the front of the reclamation two jetties, each 400 feet long and 100 feet
wide, were to be constructed. They were to be furnished with commodious
landing-stages, having platforms at various levels to accommodate steamers
at all states of the tide, and were to be connected with the railway systems

Aof the South-Eastern and London, Chatham, and Dover Companies.

depth of 15 feet at low water was to have been provided alongside and in
the approach to the jetties.

     The only part of this schpme commenced up to the present time is the

East Pier. The contract for its construction was let to Sir John Jackson
in 1892, and the memorial stone was laid by his Royal Highness the
Prince of Wales on July 20, 1893.

     Towards the end of 1895 the Admiralty instructed the authors to
prepare a design for an enclosed harbour suitaljle for the accommodation
of Her Majesty's navy. For this purpose it was necessary that a detailed

engineering survey should be made, including many thousand soundings

extending about 1;|^ miles from the shore, borings to ascertain the character
of the foundation on the lines of the several proposed works, and observa-
tions on the direction and strength of the tidal currents at various periods.

     The Avorks, which, as the result of the survey, were recommended

(see Plate), are :

    (a) An extension of the Admiralty Pier in an E.S.E. direction for a

length of 2,000 feet, practically doubling its present length.

    (6) An east arm commencing against the chalk cliffs a few hundred

feet east of the eastern boundary wall of the convict prison enclosure.
The direction of this work will be approximately S. by W., and its length

3,320 feet.

    An(c) isolated breakwater, 4,200 feet long, forming the southern
protecting arm and running generally W. by S. and E. by N., but turning

towards the north at its eastern end. The average depth, at low water, of
ordinary spring tides on the line of this Southern Breakwater is 42 feet.

     (d) The reclamation of 21 acres of the foreshore to the eastward of the
Castle Jetty. This reclamation is now being formed by the construction
of a substantial sea-wall, founded on the chalk, a little above the level of
low water of ordinary spring tides. The length of the retaining wall from
the Castle Jetty to its junction with the east arm will be 3,850 feet, of
which length the foundations are now laid and the wall brought up to

varying levels for 2,000 feet.

Between the seaward end of the East Arm and the eastern end of the

South Breakwater there will be left an entrance GOO feet in width, with a

Anavigable low-water depth of seven fathoms.     second entrance will be

formed by the head of the Admiralty Pier extension and the western end

of the Southern Breakwater. This will be 800 feet wide, and it will also

have a depth of about seven fathoms.

It will be observed that the western head of this last-named entrance

will be between 400 and 500 feet to the south of the eastern head. This

arrangement was decided on in order to assist vessels entering the harbour
at times when the east-going current is running at its greatest velocity of

nearly four knots per hour. The overlap will also facilitate the entrance

or exit of vessels during south-westerly gales.

The total length of sheltering works to be constructed is 9,520 feet,

and the area enclosed, exclusive of the Commercial Harbour, will be

610 acres at low water, 322 acres being outside the five-fathoms line, and

171 acres outside the six -fathoms line.

Comparing these figures with the proposals of the Commission of 1844,

and allowing for the existing Admiralty Pier, which was not commenced

until 1847, it is found that by the addition of only 700 feet of sheltering

works, the following gain of area will be obtained :

At low water                                     ,30 acres.
At five fathoms
At six fathoms   ,,,,.,, 52 acres.

                                                                       Il2

             REPORT 1899;

,

     This comparison appears to be perfectly fair, as the depth on the lines
of the several works of the two designs are practically identical.

     The contract for the Admiralty Harbour was let in 1897 to the well-

known firm of Messrs. S. Pearson & Sons, of London.

     Having generally described the works for the formation of the
Admiralty Harbour and the original proposal for the Commercial Harbour,

reference was made to the modified proposals for the latter (see Plate).
     In the year 1890, when the Commercial Harbour was designed, there

was no expectation that ths Government would, in the near future, con-
sider it desirable to proceed with the large national work, and the design
was consequently drawn up so that it might he complete in itself. It will
be appai-ent that, as soon as the 2,000 feet extension of the Admiralty
Pier was decided on, the smaller extension of the same work became

unnecessary. As the construction of the East Pier had, fortunately, not
reached the point at which it would have commenced to curve to the

south-west, the Harbour Board were advised tliat by continuing the work
in the direction in which it had been commenced, and by a short addition
to its length, a more capacious harbour would be obtained without in any
way interfering with the Admiralty scheme.

     The proposal being adopted by the Board, and sanctioned by the
several Government Departments, the pier has been built on the line
shown on the Plate, and is now rapidly approaching completion.

     The construction of the short western arm has consequently been

abandoned, and, as a substitute, a short ' spur ' will eventually be run out

from the extension of the Admiralty Pier.

     The low-water area of the Commercial Harbour as laid down in
1890 was 56 acres ; as now modified it will be 75 acres. This will be
admitted to be a substantial increase, more particularly when it is noted
that the addition is entirely outside the five-fathoms line, and that it will
be obtained with little or no expense to the Harbour Board beyond that

entailed by the oi-iginal proposal.

     Such are the objects for which the various piers for both the

Admiralty and Commercial Harbours liave been adopted.

     Passing from the question of the design of the harbours to that of the
method of construction of the several works by which they will be
formed, it is proposed to describe iii some detail the operations employed
in the building of the East Pier. This particular pier is selected because
the work is so far advanced that the results can be inspected, and also
because the jn-inciple adopted for the solid portion forming the outer
length is similar to that on which the several Admiralty works will

be built.
     The pier is formed first by 1,260 feet of open iron viaduct, and second

by a solid masonry work, 1,650 feet long.
     The open work was introduced chiefly to afford free circulation of the

water in the Commercial Harbour, but had it been necessary to make it
solid much additional expense would have been incurred, as the seas
caused by heavy easterly and south-easterly winds would have been con-
centrated in the re-entering angle between the new work and those then
existing on the sea front, and would probably have caused much damage

to the latter. It is almost unnecessary to say that the adoption of open
instead of solid wotk represented a ^bstkntidl decrease in cost.

     To carry the sl^ore pnd "of 1;^e xiadv^ct a^d to form a retaining wall

 to the inclined approach leading from the promenade level, a masonry
 abutment, founded on concrete cylinders carried down to the chalk, was
 formed close to the Granville Clock Tower at the west end of the

 Esplanade.

      The viaduct is built in spans of 40 feet, each pier consisting of three
 hollow wrought-iron piles strongly braced together. The width at deck
 level is 30 feet, and pi-ovides for a central roadway of 18 feet, and a
 footpath on each side of 6 feet. The level of the deck is 19 feet above
 high water of ordinary spring tides, and it is therefore not liable to
 damage even in the heaviest seas. At three points in the length of the
 work, the number of piles in a few bays is increased to five, giving a deck
 width of 56 feet, while the spans are reduced to 20 feet. Considerable
 additional stability, both laterally and longitudinally, is thus obtained.

 On the piers so constructed longitudinal lattice girders carry a platform

 or deck of corrugated iron plates.

      The ordinary section of the viaduct, and the section at the centre
 stiffening bays were shown.

     At first the piles were litted with steel points, and were driven about

 25 feet below ground level, inclusive of about 15 feet into the chalk
which exists over the whole of Dover Bay. Contrary to expectation, the
bearing power of these piles was not found sufficient, and cast-iron screws,
 3 feet 6 inches in diameter, were .substituted for the steel points.

     The screws for a few piei's proved satisfactory under the 100 tons
dead weight test to which each centre pile was invariably subjected, but
during the application of the test load at a pier about 200 feet from the
shore, the pile, much to the surprise of all present, suddenly sank about
20 feet vertically. Borings taken at close intervals round the site of the
pile showed that its position was exactly at the bottom of a cavity in the
chalk, the surface of which sloped down to the pile in all directions.

     The accident proved that the quality of the chalk was extremely
variable, and a change in system became necessary. The method adopted
for the remaining length of the viaduct is shown on the diagram. Under
the centre of each pier a cast-iron cylinder 8 feet in diameter was sunk
into the chalk and filled with concrete, the centre pile or column being
erected on a granite block bedded therein. The two side piles, on which
the loads are considerably less than on the centre, were, after the accident

before described, fitted with cast-steel screws 4 feet in diameter, and no

further trouble has been experienced.

     It may be interesting to members to learn that when the excavations

in the cylinder on the site of the pile which failed reached the depth to
which the screw had originally penetrated, the blade was found broken

into three pieces, having parted from the boss very close to the pile shank.
The explanation of the accident appears to be that parts of the screw
blade were bearing on hard chalk or flints, while other parts, as well as
the point of the boss, were in soft material lying in the cavity indicated
by the borings as already described.

     The corrugated deck of the viaduct will be filled with concrete as
soon as the outer or solid portion of the pier is completed. The surface,
both of roadway and footpaths, will be formed of asphalte.

     The solid masonry portion of the pier has a length, including the head,
of 1,650 feet, with a width at quay level of 35 feet, and at foundation
level of 48 feet. The general level of the surface is 10 feet above high
water, but at the inner end this rises on a gradient of 1 in 40 to meet
486 KEPORT-- 1899.

the higher level of the viaduct deck. When originally designed as a

sheltering work, it was intended to provide on its eastern side a parapet

somewhat similar to that on the Admiralty Pier. As shelter will in time
be given by the works of the Admiralty Harbour, this parapet will now

be omitted.

For the construction of the solid work, a substantial temporary stage

cari'ying three powerful ' Goliath ' cranes was erected. The outermost

Goliath worked a heavy grab, by means of which the loose material over-
lying the chalk Avas excavated. From the centre Goliath was slung an

exceptionally large diving-bell, from which the excavation and levelling

of the chalk bed were effected. This part of the work was very heavy,

as no block was allowed to be set at less than 3 feet below the surface of

the solid chalk.

     The inner Goliath was used for unloading the blocks brought on
trucks, over a temporary connecting viaduct now removed, and for

setting them in the pier.

The blocks throughout are of concrete, those above low water level

being faced with granite. They vary in weight from 12 to 20 tons.

Below low water they are set without mortar, but are well bonded and

keyed together by 'joggles,' inserted into recesses cored out at the time

the blocks are moulded.

Above low water the Ijlocks are set in Portland cement mortar, and

are also keyed by joggles.

    Probably some members of this Association may wish to visit the
works, and will then be able to see many details, a description of which
time does not allow to be included in this paper. Among these details,

the concrete mixing machinery, the character of the moulds used in the

manufacture of the blocks, and the methods employed for lifting them,

will probably be of most general interest.

The pier will be litfced with two fendered berths on each side and a

landing-stage, for the accommodation of steamers, on the west side.

Landing-steps, mooring-bollards, lamps, gas and water services are also

to be provided.

The pier terminates in a circular head 62 feet in diameter, and on

this a lighthouse of concrete masonry, faced with granite, will shortly be

constructed.

It has already been indicated that the type of structure adopted for

the East Pier is similar to that to be followed in building the works for

the formation of the Admiralty Harbour, but on account of their exposed

positions and the heavy wave stroke to which they will be subjected, the

latter  will  necessarily  be  of  considerably  greater  dimensions                                        compari-
                                                                                                         ;

son of the section of the East Pier with the section of the Admiralty

Pier extension, as shown on diagrams, confirms this statement.

The cross section of the Admiralty Pier extension, shown on the

diagram, is worth notice if only on account of the magnitude of the

temporary works. The staging, of which a short length can now be

seen projecting from the end of the turret, is probably more massive

than any similar structure hitherto erected in the sea. The height from

the ground level to the highest point of the Goliath is 150 feet, and the

total width of the stage at rail level 115 feet.

Comparative sections of the South Breakwater, east arm and re-

clamation wall were shown.

The area to be reclaimed between the east arm and the Castle Jetty

will be filled with chalk obtained by sloping or 'scarping' the cliBs
immediately behind the wall. The ground so formed will, in the first
instance, be utilised for the formation of the block building yards and
the erection of the workshops, stores, and offices required for the con-
struction of the east arm and South Breakwater.

   A temporary yard for the service of the Admiralty Pier extension

has been formed on the beach in front of the South-Eastern Railway

Company's ' Town ' Station.
     The blocks for the reclamation wall are built at Sandwich, where a

large quantity of ballast--i.e. sand and shingle--eminently suitable for
the manufacture of concrete has been obtained by the contractors. The
blocks, and a considerable quantity of ballast, are now brought from
Sandwich by lighters, but a light railway at present under construction
will, when completed, deliver material direct on to the reclaimed yard.
Ballast is also obtained from Dungeness, but, being practically free from
sand, requires to be mixed with the material from Sandwich before it is

used for block-making.
      Portland cement of the highest quality, manufactured under con-

tinuous inspection, analysis, and test, is alone used in any of the per-

manent works.
     It is feared that the patience of the meeting must already have been

severely tried by the length of this paper, and a subject so largely
technical. Even at the risk of being tedious it is considered that this
opportunity should not be lost for a reference to the inconvenience,
discomfort and serious delay experienced during last winter from the

interruptions to the passenger service from the port.
      That the interruptions were largely due to the position of the works

during a season unexampled for the number of heavy south-westerly

gales cannot be questioned.

      The exact cause of this will be easily understood by reference to the
Plate on which the direction of S.W. winds is represented. The seas
brought up Channel by gales from and near this quarter, and outside the
 shelter of the Admiralty Pier, travel on until they strike the western
 face of the East Pier and recoil therefrom on to the landing-stages on the
 eastern side of the Admiralty Pier, which stages in similar gales had pre-

 viously been available.
      That this action would occur and become stronger as the East Pier

 advanced seaward, without a corresponding advance of the Admiralty

 Pier, was evident before the inconvenience was actually experienced.
      In order to minimise the delay two steps were taken by the Harbour

 Board. First, an entirely new landing-stage was constructed near the
 outer end of the Admiralty Pier, where the disturbance was much less
 felt than at the stages nearer the shore. This was frequently available

 when it was impossible to approach the older berths.

       Secondly, negotiations were opened with a view if possible to delay

 further progress with the East Pier until the extension of the Admiralty
 Pier was sufficiently advanced to give the required shelter. It was, how-
 ever, found that the cost of retarding the work would be so great that

 the financial position of the Board did not justify this course being

  adopted.

       The advance of the masonry extension of the Admiralty Pier is not
  likely to be sufficient to give much additional shelter during the coming

  winter, but the large number of piles in the temporary stage will, as
--488 REPORT 1899.

experience has shown to be the case in other places, no doubt assist in

breaking up the seas ; thus it may reasonably be expected that delay

will be on a smaller scale than was experienced last year.
     In Sir John Coode's original design, the whole of the East Pier during

south-west winds would have been inside shelter of the Admiralty Pier

as it then existed.

    It is hoped it has been made clear that had it not been for the change

of plan consequent on the decision of the Admiralty to carry out the
splendid work lately started, no disturbance of the traffic would have

been experienced.

     Is it unwise to suggest that the inconvenience, serious as it has been,

--is only temporary, and that to obtain such a harbour probably second
--to none much greater sacrifices would willingly be made by almost every

port in the kingdom 1

In conclusion, at the request of the Mayor, Sir William Crundall,

attention was drawn to the peculiarly favourable situation of Dover, with

reference to several Continental ports. To illustrate this point, an

enlarged chart of the English Channel was shown, and the distances in

nautical miles from port to port were figured thereon.

The proverbial schoolboy knows that Dover is the nearest port to

Calais. It is, however, believed that very few persons, whether school-

boys or of more mature age, are aware that Dover is also nearer to

Boulogne than Folkestone ; nearer to Flushing, and therefore to Antwerp,

than either Queenborough  or  Harwich                                  that  as  regards  Dieppe,  New-
                                                                    ;

haven has the advantage by only 7 nautical miles, and Southampton,

only a similar advantage with reference to Havre.

Again, compare Dover with Southampton as a ' poi-t of call ' for

foi'eign liners from Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and all ports to the

North. The comparison will hold good whether these liners are bound

for the United States, via the Lizard, or for South Africa, India, China,

and Australia, &c., via Ushant.
     The call at Dover would involve no complicated course such as that

necessary for Southampton, via Dungeness, the Royal Sovereign lightship,
the Owers, Spithead, and Southampton Water.

     The course on leaving the ' port of call ' is also in favour of Dover, as
after passing Dungeness a straight course could be set for either the
Lizard or Ushant, no variations corresponding to Southampton Water,

the Solent, and the Needles being requisite.
     Not only would there be a saving in distance, but the risks of fogs, so

prevalent at the back of the Isle of Wight, would be much reduced.
     Under these circumstances it is not surprising to learn that proposals

have been made to utilise Dover in connection with several lines of ocean-
going steamers, and that the Harbour Board have already received
inquiries on the subject. Finally, it is hoped that with the schemes for
the improvement of the port fully before them the members of the

--Association will cordially agree with the forcible language of Sir Walter

Raleigh ' nor is there in the whole circuit of this famous island any port

more convenient, needful, or rather of necessity to be regarded, than this

of Dover.'

In presenting this our Seventh Annual Report, we must first express our

deep regret at the loss sustained by the death of Sir Douglas Galton, at

whose instigation the Committee was first appointed in 1892, who acted
as Chairman, and took a deep interest in all its proceedings.

     The Committee have continued to work in conjunction with the

Childhood Society, to whom they are indebted for access to the records of

children examined individually by members of this Committee and the

Society.

     Since our first Report in 1893 much attention has been directed to the
care of children subnormal in mental or physical conditions, and a Bill is
now before Parliament to make better provision for the elementary edu-
cation of defective and epileptic children in England and Wales.

   We hei'e give a further account of the 1,120 exceptional children

requiring special care and training, in continuation of our former Reports.
They have previously been arranged in sub-classes, presenting the class or
classes of defect named only ; the cases being distributed first in age-

groups, secondly under school standards.

     Some of these children will require special modes of care and teaching,
many are delicate in health, and a small proportion are imbecile.

     This catalogue of cases was asked for in evidence by the Committee
of the Education Department on Children Feeble-minded ; it appears in

our Report for 1897.
     Following the catalogue of cases is a table, in which the cliildren are

arranged in primary groups, presenting only the class of defect indicated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

they form about 1 per cent, of the children in public elementary schools.

Table B 3 (Report 1897) deals with children collected by the Charity

Organisation Society in various parts of London, and presented for
report as to mental and physical status ; they were examined and re-
ported on by Dr. Francis Warner. It is there shown that of 149 boys
and 89 girls collected by the C.O.S. Committee and teachers as being
defective, only 88 boys and 68 girls were on examination found so far

subnormal as to be reported ' exceptional children.' This indicates that

much care and discretion will be needed in selecting these children and in

organising special classes of schools.

     In our Report (1898), the co-relation of classes of defects in these

children is shown to be very high : they have a much greater tendency
than average childi'en to become delicate in an adverse environment,
especially the girls ; this, as might be expected, is most marked in those

under seven years of age.

      In our present R,eport the 1,120 exceptional children are arranged

in a table as presenting only the class or classes of defect indicated in
      --

   primary groups, sliowiiig their proportion to the compound groups,
    respectively as distributed under ages and sex.

         The primary groups are those containing all cases presenting the

    defect or combination of defects indicated, only.

         The compound groups are those containing all cases presenting the

    defect or combination of defects indicated, alone or in combination.

   Thus : there were 388 boys and 352 girls at all ages who presented

    developmental defects ; of these, 4'380 per cent, uf the boys and 2*557 per
    cent, of the girls presented abnormal nerve-signs only, i.e. without either

   low nutrition or mental dulness accompanying. Such cases may be found,
   for instance, among children crippled by congenital absence of a hand.

         The main classes of defect are indicated at the left hand of the table

  --by symbols : A. Defect in development of body ; B. Abnormal nerve-

   signs ; C. Low nutrition ; D. Mental dulness.

         The facts shown in the table suggest the need of management and
    care in training stage by stage, with the object of improving each phase
    of mental ability and removing individual disabilities ; children with any
    degree of congenital defect in development usually require medical care
    as to conditions of the ears, throat, and mouth, also as to eyesight and in

    general health culture.

        The abnormal nerve-signs may often be removed one by one in the

    daily practice of physical exercises, and adapted training, thus rendering
    the brain more apt for mental instruction and teaching.

        The investigation made and the facts thus far tabulated have proved
   of much value, as a basis of knowledge of childhood, especially in its sub-

    normal conditions.
         The Committee desire to be reappointed with an addition to their

   number, and a new Chairman elected to act in conjunction Avith the

    Childhood Society, for the scientific study of the mental and physical
    conditions of children, and ask a grant of 10^. in aid of their work.

preparation for that work has been carried as far as the means at their
disposal have enabled them to carry it, and because they have arrived at

the conviction that tlie work itself may now properly be left to be com-

pleted by other hands jDossessing the necessary organisation and more
adequate means.

     They are as fully convinced as ever of the importance of the work
itself and of the soundness of the principles laid down for the conduct
of it. There is ample evidence that the mixed population of this kingdom
retains in many parts of the country ti'aces of the constituents of which it
is formed. Tliose traces are to be found in physical characters, in the
expression of the features, in modes of thought, in tradition (using that
word in its wider sense), and in language ; and the conclusions drawn from
them are capable of being verified by the testimony of local history and of

archaeology.

     The method adopted by the Committee for setting on foot a compre-
hensive and scientific in^estigation into the existence and character of
these traces of the past was :

     1. To inquire what places were suitable for the survey, as containing
a population in which there had been comparatively little admixture of

race.

     2. To draw up a brief and comprehensive code of instructions for
observers, with explanatory comments and directions as to the use of

instruments for measuring, ikc.

     3. To enlist the voluntary assistance of local societies and local
observers in making measurements, collecting items of folklore, and

otherwise.

     Under the first head, the Committee collected in their first and
second reports, from the information supplied to them by persons of
authority resident in the various districts, a list of between 300 and 400
villages and places which complied with the definition laid down by the
Committee as containing a number of persons whose ancestors had

belonged to the locality for as far back as could be traced.

     Under the second head, the Committee prepared and published, in
their second and third reports, a code of instructions for observers in the
several branches of the investigation. The directions as to physical
measurements were drafted by Dr. Garson and Professor Haddon ; those
as to photographs by Mr. Francis Galton ; those as to folklore by Mr.
Edward Clodd ; those as to dialect by Professor Skeat.

     The Committee liave also published in subsequent reports a paper
drawn up by Mr. Hartland, containing many useful hints to observers

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

and a paper by INIr. Gomme, on the scientific method to be pursued in

localising folkloi'e observations, so as to enable trustworthy conclusions to

be drawn from the presence or absence in any locality of one or more

features incidental to a particular practice or superstition.

      In other reports, the Committee have published at length specimen
collections of physical observations and folklore observations, the principal
of which collections were made by the lamented Dr. Walter Gregor.
These are intended to serve as models for other observers, as it was not
the intention of the Committee to print at length in their reports the
recoi'ds of observations contributed to them hj the several collectors,
but only a digest of the results.
----

     ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 495                    V

     Under the third head, the policy of the Committee has been :

     1. To establish Sub-committees in various parts, and secure the co-
operation of local societies in forming such Committees and otherwise.

     2. To obtain the services of \'oluntopr iudiv idual observers.

     The Committee feel that tlieir best tlianks are due to the societies and

persons by whom they have been favoured with information ; but they

are also of opinion that for the future conduct of the survey, it will not
be sufficient to rely upon such assistance, however generously bestowed.

To ensure absolute uniformity in the methods of collecting information,
upon, which the usefulness of the information for the purposes of com-
parison almost entirely depends, it is essential that one or more persons
shovild be wholly engaged upon the woi'k.

     There are two methods by which this can be done :

     1. The entrusting to the Committee of the necessary means.
     2. The transfer of the work to another body possessing the necessary

means.

     Should the first course approve itself to the Section and to the Associa-
tion, it would be practicable, by a comparatively small expenditure, for
the Association itself (through the present or some other Committee) to
proceed with a work of great interest and value, on the lines which have
been exemplified by Dr. Gregor's model collections, and by the excellent

publications of Dr. Browne and Professor Haddon relating to certain com-

munities in Ireland, as it would not be difficult to find competent persons
if sufficient remuneration were assui'ed to them to justify giving their
whole time to the work.

     The circumstance which induces the Committee to lean rather to the
second course is that the Ethnographic Bureau, which has been so long an
object of desire to anthropologists, has now been established under the

auspices of the British Museum ; and the Committee cannot but think

tliat that Bureau might well include the British Islands within the scope

of its functions.

     In the meantime they suggest that the reports and observations now

in their hands might, where not returned to the writers, be distributed
among the representatives on their body of the several societies interested,

who will be able to proceed with the work of digesting them, and to
publish such of them as contain matters suitable for publication in full.
The five sets of measuring instruments in their pcssession will be returned

to the Association.

496 REPORT-- 1899.

Operations were confined to an area of about eight acres in the south-

west corner of the city.

This area is bounded on the north by insulce XV. and XVI. ; on the

east by insulce XVII. and XVIII., excavated in  1897                          and on the other
                                                                           ;

sides by the city wall. It contained two insidce (XIX. and XX.),

together with a large triangular area to the south, forming apparently

part of insula XVIII. See the plan in last year's report.
    Insula XIX. presents the peculiarity of being inclosed by a wall, and

contains, in addition to three minor buildings, a well-planned house of

early date and of the largest size, with fine hypocausts. To it is attached

the workshop of some industry, with a large inclosure dependent on it,
containing two settling-tanks, perhaps belonging to a tannery. The court-

yard of this house is partly underlaid by the i-emains of a much earlier

one, of half-timbered construction, containing in one of its chambers a

mosaic pavement of remarkable design, and perhaps the earliest in date
Ayet found in this country.
                              small house in this insula is somewhat

exceptional in plan and also, perhaps, of early date.

    Insida XX. contains a number of buildings scattered over its area,

but none of these appears to be of any importance. Two of them are of

interest as furnishing plans of houses of the smallest class. This insula

also contains one of the curious detached hypocausts which were noticed
Ain the excavations of 1897.
                              large inclosure with attached chambers,

near the lesser west gate, may be conjectured to have contained stabling

for the accommodation of travellers entering the city.

Several wells were found in both insulce, lined either with the usual
Awooden framing or disused barrels.
                                       pit in insula XX. contained a

double I'ow of pointed wooden stakes driven into the bottom, and may

have been for the capture of wild animals at some period anterior to the

existence of the Roman town, or subsequent to its extinction. No archi-

tectural remains were found, but the rubbish-pits yielded the usual crop

of earthen vessels.

The finds in bronze and bone do not call for any special notice, but an

enamelled brooch of gilt-bronze, with a curious paste intaglio and several

settings of rings, may be mentioned.

Among the iron objects are a well-preserved set of hooks, perhaps for

hoisting barrels, and a curious pair of handcufi's or fetterlock.

From a pit in insula XIX. was recovered an upper quern stone, still

retaining its original wooden handle.

Although a considerable area in the southern part produced no pits

or traces of buildings, the insulce excavated are quite up to the average in

point of interest, and their addition to the plan completes a very large

section of the city.

   A detailed account of all the discoveries was laid before the Society

of Antiquaries on May 4, 1899, and will be published by the Society in

' Archseologia.'

The Committee ask to be reappointed with a further grant.

During the past year the work of this Committee has been extended in
important directions, although the great number and diversity of interests

to be considered, the ditticulty of securing interested and competent

observers, and the great reluctance of many people to be made the subject
of such investigations, however simple, serve to make our work one of

slow progress. "We nevertheless experience a sense of gratification in

view of the increasing interest in our investigations manifested during the

last year, and we feel confident that as the nature of our work becomes

better and more widely known this interest will gain in strength.

   A large number of schedules giving detailed directions to observers

have been distributed ; but it was found necessary to issue supplementary

instructions respecting facial types and directions for certain measure-

ments. Through the courtesy of Professor F. W. Putnam and Dr. F.

Boas, we have been enabled to make use of the excellent series of facial

types employed by the Bureau of Ethnology of the World's Columbian

Exposition at Chicago.

Several requests for anthropometric instruments have been received,

but, owing to delay in obtaining the instruments ordered, this work has
not progressed as rapidly as we had hoped, and the expected data will not

be available until another year. Several observers have already forwarded

extensive records of measurements, but it would be premature at the

present time to undertake any analysis of these, as the investigations to
which they relate are still in progress.

    Much of the work in progress is of such a nature that returns cannot

be looked for under a year or more, but with the present organisation it

may be expected that each year will witness an increasing amount of

material from the various observers. Steps have ]>een taken for the

special study of groups in different provinces, and it is hoped that these

efforts may result profitably in the near future.

    The introduction into the North- West of large bodies of Europeans
who are to become permanently incorporated in our population has sug-

gested the importance of securing, at as early a date as possible, such

facts relating to their general ethnology as may seem to establish a suit-

able basis for the study of these people under the influence of their new

environment. Satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to
the Doukhobors, and it is probable that similar arrangements may be

compieted during the coming year with respect to other large bodies of

immigrants.

     The exceptional circumstances surrounding the Indians of British
Columbia ; the fact that it is becoming more difficult each year to obtain

reliable accounts of these people ; the rapid disappearance of old customs,

dress and mode of living ; and also the present availability of the services
of an expert and enthusiastic observer, have seemed sufficient reasons for
devoting to their study a much larger share of the resources of the Com-
mittee than might otherwise appear justifiable.

     Apart from the records of measurements previously alluded to, the
completed work of the past year is represented by the two papers

appended hereto.
     1. The Origin of Early Canadian Settlers. Mr. B. Suite, Ottawa.
     2. Studies of the Indians of British Columbia. Mr. C. Hill-Tout,

Vancouver, B.C.

     The important studies of ]\Ir. Hill-Tout have been prosecuted under
considerable difficulties, but with the most painstaking care. They repre-
sent, for the most part, material which is altogether new, while those
which cover ground previously worked over embody results in such a way
as to preserve their value as contributions to our knowledge of these

people.

     One of the principal difficulties met with by Mr. Hill-Tout has been

the reluctance of the Indians to submit themselves to the process of

measurement, or even, under satisfactory conditions, to the camei-a.
     Prints, in duplicate, of a certain number of photographs already ob-

tained by INlr. Hill-Tout accompany this report, and it is hoped that a

more important contribution of this kind may be forthcoming next year.

      Also accompanying this report is a series of fifteen prints, in duplicate,

Cof photographs of the villages and totem-poles of the Haida Indians of

the Queen Charlotte Islands, taken by Dr. M. Dawson, Director of the

Geological Survey of Canada, while engaged in a .survey of these islands

in the year 1878. These are the first photographs taken of the villages in
question, and they possess some interest as a matter of record in conse-
 quence of the fact that the objects and conditions represented by them have

 now almost wholly disappeared. Some of these views have been reproduced

 in the Report of Progress of the Geological Survey for 1878-79, to

 which reference may be made.

              Early French Settlers in Canada. By B. Sulte.

     Leaving aside the men engaged in the fur trade, and who did not
adopt the colony as their home, we find that only 122 actual settlers or
heads of families arrived in Canada during the period of 1608-1645.

     Nine-tenths of tliese men have numerous descendants still amongst

us. In this respect Canada is far ahead of any colony. Tlie New England

States can hardly name twenty families coming from their first stock,
that is before 1645, although their immigration was five times at least

larger than ours.

     There was no special organisation for recruiting in France.

     Nearly every one of these 122 men married just before leaving for
Canada or soon after their arrival in the colony. They all belonged to

that class of people devoted altogether to agriculture, such as grains, hay,

oats, vegetables, hemp, flax. They understood thoroughly well the work
of felling trees and clearing land, because the provinces they came from
wei'e of good soil, but not adapted for fruits and vine, nor fit for pasturage
on a large scale.

     Eighty-four men arrived from 1634 to 1641, nineteen only from 1642

to 1645, probably on account of the raids by the Iroquois.

     From 1608 to 1645 Normandy sent 38, Perche 27, Paris 5, Beauce 4,
Picardy 3, Maine 3, Brie 3, or a total of 83 from the north of the river

Loire to the English Channel.

    The mai-ried women numbered 119, out of which 68 were from the
north of the Loire ; Perche 24, Normandy 23, Paris 10, Picardy 7.

Anjou 2, Beauce 2.

    Women whose provinces are not known number thirty, but it would

seem they were also from the north, and had follov/ed their parents and

relatives. Therefore the eighty-two ^ married men enumerated in the list
as coming from the north were equalled by the .same number of married
women from the same region, whether the wedding took place in France

or in Canada.

    Five women born in Canada married in the colony before 164.^ : three
of them became widows and remarried. Three women born in France,
and who had arrived with their husbands, became widows, and remarried

during that period. Girls thirteen or fourteen years old married young

men newly settled.
    The women from Champagne, Au\-ergne, Saintonge, Rochclle, and

Poitou are nine in all, with eleven men from these same parts. Besides

this Brittany furnished 2 men, Lorraine 1, Nivernais 1, Forez 1. They
undoubtedly came by themselves, like those of the north.

    The proportion is about the same of men and women whose places of

origin are not indicated, a sixth of the total immigration.

Including one widower and two bachelors.

    The following notes on the N'tlaka'pamuQ are a summary of the
writer's studies of this division of the Salish of British Columbia. They
treat to some extent of the ethnography, archceology, language, social

customs, folklore, itc, of this tribe, recording much, it is believed, not

hitherto gathered or published. For my folklore, ethnography, and
social customs notes I am chiefly indebted to Chief Mischelle, of Lytton,
than whom there is probably no better informed man in the whole tribe.

The primitive cu.stoms of the N'tiaka'pamuQ, like those of their neigh-

bours, have for the most part given way to new ones borrowed from the

"whites. Some few are retained in a more or less modified fonii, and are

still practised by the older people. The social system of the N'tiaka'pamuQ

seems to have been a very .simple one. I could hear of nothing in the

way of .secret societies, totemic systems, or the like. The whole group

was comprised under one tribal name, and spoke the game tongue with

slight dialectal differences. They were, however, divided into numerous*

village communities, each ruled over by an hereditary chief. Of these

latter there were three of more importance than the rest, viz. the chief of

the lower division of the tribe, whose headquarters was Spu'zum ; the
chief of the Nicola division, which was called by the lower division

Tcua'qamuq                                                   and  the chief  of  the  central  divLsion, whose                                                                                                                                       headquarters

but not, in the strict sense of the word, five divisions. There were the central

with the neighbouring communities, constituted the N'tlaka'pamuQoe, i.e. the

N'tiaka'pamuQ proper), and the villages on the Fraser above Tlk-umtcl'n, which

formed the central division; the villages on the upper part of the Thompson, and

division TJta'mpt, as if it were the divisional name of these lower communities.

This is a misconception. The term means, rather, 'below river' people or 'down

river ' people, and is applied by these very people themselves to the Y^ale tribe

below them, and by the Y'ale people again to the other Kau'itcin tribes farther

down the river. I know of no proper ' group ' name peculiar to the lower division

other than the general term N'tiaka'pamuQ.

assisted by a council of elders. In all the relations of life the elders of

the bands played an important part, and in all family consultations theii'

advice was sought and listened to with the greatest deference and

respect. In addition to the hereditary chiefs, martial chiefs or leaders

were temporarily elected during times of warfare from among the

warriors. It was a rai'e thing for the district or communal cliief to lead

or head a war party. The only part it seems they played was in sanc-

Mytioning lights and in bidding them cease.  informant told me that

the N'tlaka'pamuQoe chiefs were, as a rule, peace-loving men, always

more anxious to prevent wars than to bring them about ; and that the

grandfather of the present Lytton chief would go out after a battle and

purchase the prisoners taken captive in the fight, who were held as slaves

by their captors, and set tliem free and send them Itack to their own

Howpeople again.  far tliis was general I cannot say. That war, how-

ever, with the neighbouring tribes was not an unusual occurrence is clear

from the fact tliat it was found necessary to fortify their villages or some

particular portions of them by palisades, inside of whicli the people Avould

retire when hard pressed by the enemy. The name of one of the upper

villages close to the boundary of the Stlatlumn bears testimony to this

fact, as it signifies in English ' a palisaded enclosure with houses inside,'

and the old men of Lytton can recall the old fort of their village. These

protective measures would seem to bear out my informant's statements

that the N'tlaka'pamuQ were not a warring people, and all the notes that

I could gather of past encounters with other tribes show the N'tlaka'pamuQ

to be the defenders and not the attackers.

                  Weapons of Warfare.

The warrior's weapons were the bow and arrow, stone swords, and

clubs, tkc. Of these latter there were several kinds. One of these was a

sling-club formed by inclosing a round stone in a long strip of elk-hide.

The stone was placed in the centre of the strip and securely sewn there,

the ends of the hide being left to swing the weapon by. This was a

deadly weapon in the hands of a skilful person, but awkward to handle

by tliose not accustomed to its use; for if not properly wielded it was just

Aas likely to damage the holder as the person he struck at.  wooden

club fashioned from the wood of the wild crab-apple tree was another

effective weapon much used by the warriors. This would sometimes be

studded with spikes of stone or horn. It was fastened to the wrist by a

thong when fighting (see fig. 1). Besides these there were also stone-

tipped spears or javelins, and elk-horn or stone tomahawks. Poisoned

arrows were used in warfare, and these were always put in a special

quiver of dogskin. The stone tips of these arrows were always larger

than those used for game. The poison was obtained either from the

rattlesnake or from certain roots. For protection tlie fighting men wore

a short sleeveless shirt of doubled or trebled elk-hide, which hung from

the shoulders, and was fastened at the sides by thongs. This shirt was

called N'tsk'En in the Thompson tongue. It was usually covered with

painted figures and symbols of war (see fig. 2) in black, white, and red

paint. The two latter colours were mineral products. Red ochre is

found in considerable quantities within their boundaries. Tlie white

paint was obtained by burning a certain kind of mineral clay which,

when burnt, produced a fine white powder easily converted into paint by

mixing with oil or fat. This powder was also employed by the women in

N'tlaka'pamuQ were common property. But no one under penalty of a

severe punishment could take a fish, pick a berry, or dig a root until after
the Feasts of First Fruits had been held. These feasts were conducted

--as follows : When the salmoD, for instance, begin to run, word is brought

to the divisional chiefs that the fish are coming up river. Messengers are
then sent to the neighbouring villages, calling a meeting of the people on

a certain day, at which all must attend at the appointed place. When the

day has arrived and the people have assembled, the head chief, attended
by the other lesser ones and the elders, opens the ceremony at daybreak
by a long prayer. While the prayer is being said everybody must stand
with eyes reverently closed. To ensure this being done, as it was regarded
as an essential part of the ceremony, certain of the elders were assigned the
duty of watching that no one opened his eyes while the prayer was being

said. Exactly to whom these prayers were addressed my informant could

not tell me. All I could gather was that the ' old Indians ' believed in

some great and beneficent power who dwelt behind the clouds, and who
gave them the salmon, fruits, roots, &c. ; who, if they showed themselves

ungrateful or unthankful, could, and might, withdraw his gifts from them.

He could not give me any of the words of these prayers. ^ After the prayer

is over every one present is given a bit of salmon which has been cooked

for the purpose. As soon as all have partaken of the salmon a feast is

prepared at which each is free to eat as much as he desires. When the

meal is concluded, a dance takes place. Each person lets down his or her

hair and a space is cleared for the dancers. Singing always accompanies
the dancing, and a certain individual leads the dance song in a loud voice,
and the dancei's keep time with the singer. They dance on this occasion
in a circle, with the hands extended, palm upwards, before them, swaying
them with a rhythmic motion from side to side as they sing and dance.
Towards the conclusion of the dance the time quickens and the move-

ments are more rapid and vigorous. As the dance is about to end the

master of the ceremonies calls to the people to stretch their palms
towards the sky and look upwards. They continue in this attitude for a
little while, and the chief presently brings his hands together, closing them
as he does so, as if he held something in them, and lowers them gently to
the level of his breast and then places them, one fist over the other,

against his breast. This action signifies the reception of the gifts asked

for in the prayer and song. The whole ceremony is conducted throughout
with the greatest decorum and reverence. This dance is repeated again
at noon and at sunset. The Feast of Berries and Boots is conducted in a
similar manner. Besides these periodic prayings, daily prayers were said
by one of the elders in each ' keekwilee-house ' every morning at day-
break, all the worshippers closing their eyes reverently the whole time and
repeating in an earnest tone the closing formula Aksai'as, which signified
to them very much what our Atnen does to us.

      Other dances were indulged in at times besides these at the Feasts of
First Fruits, at which all the actors sat and swung their extended hands,
palm upwards, from side to side, keeping time to a song called K-oia'tct.

       In an account of the training of the young men of the tribe given below, the
young man addresses his prayer to a being called Koana'kua, who is the giver of the
gifts he desires. From the strong resemblance this word bears to those having
reference to the sun, and to heat, day, &c., I am disposed to think this being to
whom the N'tlaka'pa-muQ addressed their prayers was the Sun God of the Coast

tribes (see below)
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY Of CANADA*                           605

The N'tlaka'pamuQ apparently never used masks of any kind at their

dances, such paraphernalia being quite unknown to them.

Puberty customs seem to have been much simpler among the N'tlaka'-

pamuQ than among other tribes. All I could gather concerning them

was that when a girl arrived at puberty she must withdraw herself from

her family for a time and live apart by herself. I could not gather that

any particular course of life was prescribed for the occasion, or that she

was forbidden to eat certain kinds of food. It would appear tiiat their

whole lives were much simpler and more natural than those of their con-

Wegeners elsewhere.  see tins in their marriage customs, for instance,

which are simple compareil with those of other tribes, or even with those

of the ' Stalo ' or River Indians below them.

                     Marriage Customs.         ·

    When a youth arrived at marriageable age he generally had a maiden
in his eye whom he wished for wife. He would first put himself in her
way and they would stroll out together. He would next send her little

presents from time to time. If she was not averse to his suit she would

accept these ; if otherwise she would refuse them. If his gifts were ac-

cepted he would then declare his liking for her, and tell her he would gi^'o

her a year to make up her mind in the matter. If things went smoothly

during this period, at the end of the time he would then send a present by

a friendly elder of his family to the girl's parents. If they accept the

present they call together the relatives and friends of the family, who dis-

cuss the subject ; and if the young man is acceptable to the majority of

them, the girl's father takes an elk-hide, cuts it into strips of useful

lengths, and gives each one present a piece. This witnesses to their agree-

ment. After this has been done one of the old men of the girl's family

goes to the young man and informs him that his suit is acceptable to the

family, and that he may have the girl for wife. Supposing that a majority

of the family be against him his present is returned and he is notified as

before that he cannot have the girl, and must look elsewhere for a wife.

When he has been accepted the bridegroom goes the day following to the

girl's home, accompanied by all his friends and relations, who carry food

Aand other gifts with them.  feast is prepared from this food, the gifts

are distributed, and a general good time is indulged in. After the meal

is over the old people declare themselves satisfied witii the arrangements

in a loud voice. The young man and his bride ai'e now man and wife,

and share the same blanket that night. Next day the girl returns with

her husband to his home, and some days later her parents and relatives

come and pay them a return visit, bringing with them also food and gifts.

A second feast is then pi'epared, the gifts are distributed, and all partake

of the food as before. This concludes the marriage ceremony, the pair

                                                      Shamanism.

    Shamanism was prevalent among the N'tlaka'pamuQ. This we can
gather readily enough from their stories, and certain spots and localities
are pointed out by the older Indians as the places where certain celebrated
Shamans underwent their fasts and training to gain their powers. There

are several such spots on the banks of Stain Creek, a mountain stream

hollowed places are pointed out here and there, and these are said to have

been made by tlie feet of the aspirants after Shamanistic powers in the

Weperformance of their exercises.  find several groups of rock paintings

along this creek, which are believed by the present Indians to have been

made in the past Ijy noted Shamans. It is interesting to note that these

paintings are invariably found high up on the cliff surfaces above the

--reach of the tallest man in some cases as high as twenty or thirty feet

from the ground. It is clear, therefoi'e, tliat they must have used .some

kind of ladder or platform to reach these heights. This, to the Indian

mind, always adds to their mystery. The modern Indians seem to have

no knowledge of the signification of these paintings, and say that the

pigments used by themselves will not stand the weather or endui'e like

those of the ancients.

nobility. It would appear that when a child was born it might be called
by any name. Later, when he had grown up, his parents gave a great
feast, to which all the friends of the family were invited, and a name was
then chosen from among the names of his dead ancestors and bestowed

upon him by which he was thereafter known. Among tlie common
people the men kept the names gi\ en at birtii, or had nicknames applied

to them.

                        Morluari/ Customx.

Very little could be learned directly of their ancient mortuary customs.

They have been so long under missionary influences that tlieir old prac-

Atices have for the most part died out and been forgotten.  few of these,

however, they still keep up, such as cutting the hair short and special

washings or cleansings in the river. Tiie widow must not lie in her bed,

but on branches spread on the floor, and every moi'ning she must undergo

a purification by washing her body with fir-tips. This is kept up for a

longer or shorter time, as the widow's feelings dictate or prompt.

I could not learn that slaves were ever killed at the burial of their

masters ; and there is certainly nothing in the disposal of the bodies of

the ancient dead, as far as is now discoverable, to warrant a belief in such

practices. In modern burials horses and colts are frequently killed, but

mynot,  informant was at pains to tell me, for sacrificial or religious

purposes, but that their flesh might supply food for the burial feast. The

skins of these slain animals were afterwards hung upon the branches of

some neighbouring tree. I liave seen several of these skins myself on

trees near the burial-grounds.

                                                         Birth Customs.

    The birth customs, like the death customs, have also been much
modified by missionary influence. In the days before the whites, when a

child was born, it was wrapped in a bundle of tlie soft inner bark of the cedar
prepared for the purpose. Later it was wrapped in soft skins and placed
in its cradle, which was (and still is) made, in the case of the poorer class
of natives, from birch-bark, and in the case of the better class from neatly
woven basket-work. It Avould seem that no cradle was ever used twice
over for different children, but after the child had grown out of it, and
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  507

noefled it no longer, it. was taken to the burial-ground and placed in or
under a tree with all the paraphernalia belonging to it wrapped up inside ;
or was suspended to the branches or placed in a fork of a tree in the
forest. I have myself found many such thus placed or hidden away. In

the modern cradle one invariably tindsthe bottom lined with a piece of tin
cut from tlie side of a kerosene can. This in former days was, of course,
impossible. They are also sometimes highly decorated with the brass cases
of rifle cartridges fastened through the cap-hole by thongs to the edge of the
cradle. They doubtless had a practical as well as an aesthetic value. The
jingle of them would attract the infant's attention and amuse it. Infants
were, and still are, always nursed and dandled in the cradle, which the

mother always carries about with her. On Sundays nothing is commoner

where there is a church than to see the mothers bringing 'their cradles to

the service with them. When the cliild is fretful they rock the cradle

on their knees or set it upright so that the child may look about it and

see what is going on. Generally tlie head of the cradle is covered with a
movable hood, whicli can be pushed back or drawn forward at will.

                                            Tattooing and rainting.

     Tattooing was, and to some extent still is, practised by tiie women.

The commonest marks are three parallel lines. On old women these are

seen on the side of the face, and sometimes on the chin, but on the

younger ones more commonly on the wrist or arm. I made many

inquiries, but was unable to discover what signification these marks had

other than that they were decorative. I am disposed to think, however,

that in earlier days they had some special significance, this particular

marking of three simple lines being so common and so universal among
the women. The women also formerly pierced the septum of the nose, in
which the dentalium sliell was worn. Facial and body paintings were
quite common among tlie men of the N'tlaka'pamuQ. To express joy they
painted the face white and red, as we learn from their stories. The

warrior always painted liis face before going into battle, and the youths
in their morning sports and exercises covered their bodies with all kinds

of fanciful designs.

                                                            Games.

     They were fond of games, like their neighbours, and utilised the level
grassy river benches for various games of ball. One of these games,
called by them suk' -kul-lila' -ka, was not unlike our own game of football.
The players were divided, as with us, into two groups, and at each end of
the field was a goal formed by two poles planted several feet asunder.
The play commenced from the middle of the field, and the object of the
players was to get the ball through the goal of their adversaries. The
ball was made from some kind of tree fungus, cut round and covered with
elk-hide. I could not learn anything of the rules of the game ; nor was

my informant certain whether the feet or hands, or both, were used in

propelling the ball. Mention is made of this game in one of the stories
here recorded. C ambling was also a favourite pastime here as elsewhere.
The game known by the term L'tjnq Avas that commonly practised.
Much betting went on among the players, and all bets were made and
' booked ' before the game commenced. The method of ' booking ' was
primitive. The objects staked were simjjly tied or fastened together and
set on one side till tlie game was over, the winner then taking his own
508 REPOKT-- 1899;

and his opponent's property. The game seema to have consisted in

declaring in which hand the player held the marked one of two other-

wise similar short bone rods, which could easily be held in the closed

Mypalm.       informant possessed a pair of these, which he was good

enough to give me. Besides these two rods there were also twelve short

pieces of wood used as well. These seemed to have played the part of

counters, but of this I am not certain, this j^art of the game not being

clear to me.

                  Clothing.

The old-time clothing has entirely gone out of use, with the exception

of the moccasin, which is still almost exclusively worn by the old people

Aof both sexes.  man's clothing in former days consisted of a shirt

which reached to his middle, made from the skin of the elk, deer, coon,

or ground-hog. Below this he wore leggings of deer-skin or other suit-

able material which reached to the top of the thigh. In addition to this

he would sometimes wear a breech-clout of skin. For his feet he had

neatly made moccasins ; and for his head, when he so desired it, a cap of
the skin of the porcupine or of a loon with the feathers on. Commonly

they wore no head covering, living as they did mostly within the dry

belt of the province. The dress of the women of the nobler class con-

sisted of a long doe-skin shroud or smock, reaching from the neck to the

feet, and tied in at the waist with a band fastened on either side (see

fig. 3). They were usually fringed at the side seams and at the upper

and lower seams of the arms. They were also, in the case of chiefs'

wives and daughters, at times profusely decorated with beads, .shells, and

other ornamentation. The native name for this garment was tlalla'k.

Below these they sometimes wore leggings called matta's, and on their

feet finely wrought moccasins. The commoner women and female slaves

wore only a short skirt, and went bare-legged and bare-footed.

                  Sweat-hoitsps.

The sweat-house was and still is a groat institution among the

MyN'tlaka'pamuQ.  informant, wlio on my last visit to Lytton was

suffering from paralysis of his lower limbs, was looking forward to the

time when he would be so far recovered as to be able to take a sweat-

bath. The method of taking the bath appears to be the same here as

elsewhere, and as a description of these houses has been given before by

Dr. G. M. Dawson, it will be unnecessary for me to give it here.

                                                                 Food.

     The food of the N'tlaka'pamuQ depended somewhat upon the location
of the various divisions of the tribe. The chief food of the Thompsons

was venison, and the men of this district were usually skilful huntei's and
trappers. They sometimes followed the game with the bow and arrow,
accompanied by dogs trained to pull down the quarry ; but most of their
game was taken by means of traps and snares of various kinds. Of these
the noose, pit, and drop-snares were the commonest. Mention is made

of the noose snare for catching deer in one of the stories given below.

On the Fraser below Lytton the Indians were mostly fishers and poor

hunters. Their method of taking the salmon between Lytton and Yale

was by means of the dip-net. When the salmon are running, the Indians

may be seen in great numbers thus fishing on the banks of the river.

This neb scarcely needs description : its name implies its use and form.

BrieHy it is a meshed bag, from throe to four feet deep, attached to a

hoop-like frame, to which a long slim pole is fastened. The fisher holds

this pole in his two hands, and dips in the net on the up-stream side of

him, with its mouth towards the current, and draws it slowly and

reo-ularly against the stream, as far as the pole allows, and then returns

it in the air and repeats the action again. He continues thus till he has

secured a tish. The w^onien stand by to receive the fish, which they kill

by a blow on the head. They then quickly and deftly cut it open, wrench

off the head by inserting a stick through one of the gills and out through

the mouth, and, giving it a dexterous turn of the wrist, cut out the back-

bone, spread the two halves open, and hang it up to dry in an open shed

constructed of poles for the purpose near liy on the bank. Scores of

these may still be seen along the line of the railway as one passes from Yale

to Lytton. The knives which the women use for this are fashioned after

the pattern of their own old implement, and are quite conniionly made

from a piece of an old hand-saw about five or six inches long, on the back

of which is secured a grooved piece of rounded wood about one and a half

inches thick, which runs the whole length of the steel, and serves as a

handle. The opposite or blade edge is ground down, and the ends are

rounded, having, when completed, very much the appearance of a meat

or suet chopper. I was told by some Indian women whom I watched at

work  that  they prefer  this style of  knife to  any other                                                         and to  judge  by
                                                                                                                 ;

the dexterous manner in which they ran the edge from the vent upwards

alon" the belly of the fish, opened it out, cut out the backbone, and had

it ready for drying, it certainly is an effective instrument for the purpose

in their hands.

     Above Lytton on the Thompson, where the water is too clear for
catching fish in nets, they spear them by torchlight. The fish show
white at night under the glare of the torches, and the men go out in
canoes and spear them readily. The spearman occupies the centre of the
canoe, and when the salmon, attracted by the glare of the torches, comes
near, he throws his spear at it and rarely misses his mark. The fish is

now quickly seized by one of the others, knocked on the head, the spear

withdrawn, and the tish thrown to the bottom of the canoe.

                                          Salmon Oil and Butter,

    The N'tlaka'pamuQ had another way of treating the salmon besides
dryin" them. They extracted oil from them in considerable quantities.

To do this they would place some forty or fifty fish, according to their
size, in a large trough which they hollowed out from the trunk of a tree,

as they did their canoes, with fire and adze. When the salmon were ripe,

that is in a rotten state, water was poured in upon the mass in sufficient
quantities to iust cover the whole. Heated stones were tlien put in and
the whole mass stirred till it was reduced to a hot pulp. The stones
were then taken out and a pailful of cold water was poured on, which
caused the oil to rise to the top. The oil was at this stage of a reddish
tin^e and had, so say the Indians, no offensive smell. It was now
skimmed off into birch-bai'k buckets with a spoon, made sometimes from
the horn of the mountain sheep and sometimes of wood. It was
allowed to stand overnight and boiled afresh next day and skimmed till
quite clear. The oil was then stored away in bottles very ingeniously
made fi'om whole skins of medium-sized salmon. The skin for this pur-
ON THE ETHNULOUICAL SUKVEY OK CANADA,  511

pose was drawn from the salmon much as ohe draws oil" a tight- fittin"

glove that will nut conic off without Iseiiig tuiiu-d inside out. It was
then carefully cleaned by rubbing with dry punk-wood, after which it
was rubbed with deer or mountain-sheep suet. The skin was then ready,
and was turned right side out ; the oil was poured in and the moutli securely

fastened. In the meantime the flesh of the salmon had not been
neglected. After the oil had bceii skimmed off, the water was strained
away and the i-emains worked up and kneaded into balls and put in the
sun to dry. AVhile drying it was occasionally smelt to see that it was
sweet and devoid of flavour. After a time it was squeezed and washed

and kneaded again and put to dry once more. When quite dry and free

from all smell it was broken up and rubbed tine between the hands till
it took on the appearance of Hour. Some of this was then placed in the
bottom of a birch-bark basket, and on this were laid the bottles of oil

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and when the basket was full more of the salmon flour was spread over
the top and down the sides until the bottles were encased and buried in
it. The whole was then stowed away for winter consumption. In addi-
tion to this way of preserving the oil, they had another way of treating

Ait. kind of butter was manufactured from it by mixing it with equal

quantities of the best kidney suet, taken from the deer or, preferably,

from the mountain sheep. The oil and suet were boiled up together,

thoroughly mixed, and then set to cool. When cool the compound had

the consistency of butter, and was esteemed a great delicacy among the
natives. It was eaten, among other things, with the compressed cakes
which they made from the service {amalancliier) and other berries, of
which great quantities grow in their region. Only the wealthier class

could afford food of this kind. Besides veni-son and fish, wild fruit of all
such kinds as grew in their neighbourhood and was edible, and roots and

many kinds of herbs, were eaten. As Dr. G. ]M. Dawson has given a list

of these, with their botanical names, and has also described with .some
detail their method of preparing them in his 'Notes on the Shuswap

People of British Columbia,' it will be unnecessary for me to enumerate

them here.

                                                                        Utensils.

     For boiling their food the N'tlaka'pamuQ always used basket kettles
made like their other basketry from the split roots of the cedar.' These
roots are sometimes dyed red and black, and very beautiful patterns are

made from the three different colours. According to my informant, the

red dye was obtained from the bark of the alder-tree, and the dark stain
was obtained by soaking the roots in black slime or mud.-' So skilfully

     ' Dr. G. M. Dawson, in liis 'Note.s on the Sliuswap Peopfe of British Columbia,'

tells us that these baskets were made from roots of the spruce, and Dr. Boas, in
his Report on the Shuswaps, informs us that the basketry of the tihuswaps and
N'tlaka'pamuQ was made from the roots of the white pine. I cannot say what

material the Shuswaps constructed their baskets from, but if my informant is

correct, the N'tlaka'pamuQ always used the root of the cedar ; and I know no better

authority among the Thompson Indians than Chief Mischelle, of Lytton, from whom

to obtain information of this kind. [As the N'tlaka'pamuQ were pre-eminent in

basket-making, it is possible that the information gained by Mr. Hill-Tout may be

--accepted as correct, although the cedar (Thuya) is not abundant in the Thompson

River country. G. M. D.]

     - According to Dr. Boas the black dye was obtained from the fern root. It is
possible it was got in both ways.
512 REPOKT-- 1899.

did the women make these baskets that they would hold liquids without

--trouble. In preparing any food two kettles were customarily used one

containing water for washing off any dirt that might adhere to the heated

stones, and the other for holding the food. In boiling salmon for eating

the fish were tied up in birch bark to prevent breaking and falling to

pieces.

The house furniture and utensils were few and simple. Tables and

chairs, or such like conveniences, were quite unknown. Wooden dishes,

hollowed out from the solid block by means of stone, bone, or beaver-teeth

chisels, and wooden or horn spoons were sometimes used by the wealthier

class                     but usually the food was served up and eaten off reed mats, which
                       ;

served also as seats, carpets, and beds. These latter were commonly laid

directly on the ground, which was strewed with the bushy ends of lir

branches. The beds of the common people were simply a few reed mats,

but in the houses of the chiefs and headmen these were supplemented

with skins and blankets woven from the hair of the mountain sheep or

goat. The people always disrobed when going to bed, and as there

were no division or apartments in the ' keekwilee-houses,' but for the

dusk there could not have been much privacy about the matter. Yet it

is clear from their folk -tales that the maidens of the upper ranks, at least,

were modest and diifident, and when out bathing always chose the most

secluded spots, and were as embarrassed and shamed at being seen naked

as any white maiden might be. I have been struck again and again in

my work among the Indians with this keen sense of modesty in the

girls of the interior, particularly those who have come under the influence

of the Sisters.

The houses of the N'tlaka'pamuQ resembled those of the other interior

tribes. For the greater part of the year they lived in semi-subterranean

dwellings known in the trade jai'gon as ' keekwilee-houses.' These

houses, of which there is no perfect specimen left in the province,

were of varying dimensions. Those of Lytton were from 30 to 50 feet

in diameter. Nothing of them now remains but the saucer-like depres-

sions which mark the spots where they formerly stood. As a descrip-

tion of these dwellings has been given both by Dr. Boas in his Reports,

and by Dr. G. M. Dawson in his ' Notes,' &c., it will be unnecessary
for me to give another here. I will only say that the dimensions of

these dwellings as given by the above writers fall considerably below the

dimensions of those commonly found among the central and lower

divisions of the N'tlaka'pamuQ. Of the upper I cannot speak from per-

sonal knowledge. Dr. G. M. Dawson speaks of those he saw as having

a diameter of from 1 to 30 feet ; and Dr. Boas describes his as having

a diameter of from 12 to 15 feet.^ The shortest diameter to be found on

the old camp site at Lytton was 34 feet, and they rise from this to 54

feet                   and the old men of  the neighbourhood, whom  I questioned on  this
                    ;

matter, and most of whose lives had been spent in them, informed me that

GO and even 70 feet were not uncommon diameters. There is one now,

which I measured in company with Mr. Harlan Smith, of the New York

Museum of Natural History, on the left bank of Stain Creek, not far

    ' The dimensions given by me were not from actual measurement, and lam ready

to accept Mr. Hill-Tout's figures. Dr. Boas's illustration of tlie construction of these

houses, in one of the Keports of the B. A. A. S. Committee on the N. W. tribes, is
incorrect, as afterwards stated by him. The actual method of construction is shown

--in a diagram in my paper, here several times referred to by Mr. Hill-Tout. G. M. D.

from where it Joins the Fraser, that measures 59 feet from the posthole

on one side to the corresponding hole on the other. These dwellings were
usually inhabited by several families, more or less closely related to one
another ; and in the very large ones sixty or seventy souls would often pass

the winter together. Commonly there was but one fire in the centre, but
 if the weather was very cold smaller fires would be kindled near the four

great supporting poles. Fires were also at times lighted here for culinary

purposes, when many families inhabited the same house. The floors of

these houses were kept covered with small fir branches, which wei-e
renewed about every three or four days. The entrance to these houses
was through the smoke-hole in the roof, a notched tree which projected

some way beyond the hole being used as a means of ascent and descent.
The central space between the four supporting poles was common ground
in the centre of which was the fire. Behind this, under the sloping
roofs, each family or group had its own quarters.

     The summer dwellings were extremely simple, consisting merely of a
framework of light poles covered with mats or wattled, and all cooking
was done in the open air. The food supplies of the centi-al N'tlaka'j^amuQ
were invariably stored in caches, i.e. holes in the ground, which were
roofed with poles or boards, and then again covered with earth or sand.
The food was commonly protected from the soil or sand by bark. Re-
mains of these caches or cellars, with rolls of birch and other bark in

them, may be seen at any of the old camp sites. Many such, now filled

with sand to the level of the surrounding ground, are found at Tlk-umtci'n.
In the lower division and elsewhere small sheds were erected on poles
standing from 5 to 10 feet above the ground, to be out of the reach of dogs

and other animals. As a rule these structures are found only where the

ground is rooky, or of such a nature as makes excavations difficult or

impossible, as along the Fraser Cafion above Yale.

                                                                       Ilospitality.

     Hospitality was recognised as a virtue, and practised as a duty, among
the N'tlaka'pamuQ, and every one was constrained to offer the stranger or

visitor the best he possessed.^

                                                                 Customs.

     The N'tlaka'pamuQ had many singular and superstitious customs and
practices, some of which we may gather from their folk -tales. Some of
these they still practise. For instance, when roots are to be baked,
women only must do it. I could learn no satisfactory reason for this!
The old-time training for young men has many interesting and unique
features about it. Of these I learnt the following, none of which are any
longer practised. In the days before the advent of the whites, when a
youth wanted to fit himself to become a hardy hunter, he would go down
to the river's edge at the close of the salmon run, when the carc^asses of

dead and maggot-filled salmon would be found lying along the banks in
great numbers, and thrust his hands up to the wrists in the rotting,
maggoty mass, and keep them there for hours together. This was said to
harden them, so that they became impervious to the cold when out
hunting in cold weather. They would do this many times in their late
boyhood. Another method of attaining the same end was to lie down at

the edge of the rivei* all night with the hands and wrists soaking in tho

cold water. They would also repeat this many times before the desired
callousness to cold was attained. The old people affirm that the young
men of their day and earlier were hardier and stronger than the young
men of to-day. They say the present youths would succumb to the
ti-aining and hardening endured by their grandfathers. In the old days

a youth Avas generally ambitious of becoming a great liunter, or warrior,
or runner, or athlete generally. To acquire a superiority over his fellows
he was ready for the greatest acts of self-denial and self-discipline. This
spirit of emulation was encouraged and enjoined by the elders, and they

were taught to pray to the great spirit known as Koana'kOa, and seek gifts

from him in the following manner. When a young man desired any

special blessing or gift, he would rise early in the morning, some time
before daybreak, and go alone and unseen to the top of some hill or emi-
nence, or to the river's side, and pray. This act in itself required, on his
part, no small courage and self-conquest, the forest and mountains at

night being peopled in the lively imagination of the Indian with spirits

and shades of all kinds. If he sought for some physical athletic gift he
would practise himself therein as well as pray for it in words like the

following : O' Koana koa,^ make my arm strong, my chest strong, my
legs untiring. Make all my body strong ; make my heart good. Make
me a great hunter, a great man, a great warrior, a great runner or jumper,'

as the case might be.
     In order that the prayers and exercises might be efficacious, it was

necessary that the suppliant should arise before any one was awake
or stirring ; and his prayers and exercises must be finished and he on his

way home before the sun appeared above the horizon. He does this

three mornings successively, and if he has been careful to observe the

rules and conditions twice out of the three times at least, his prayers will
be granted, and he will receive the gifts asked for. If, on the contrary,
he has been lazy and careless, and did not rise early enough, and was seen

leaving the camp, or did not perform his exercises or say his prayers

before sunrise, instead of his requests being granted some evil gift will be

given him instead.

     Besides these special trainings and exercises undertaken at their own
desire, there were the daily moi-ning exercises. The young men of the

village were accustomed to turn out early in the morning and go to the

river to swim, after which they would return to the camp and indulge

in various athletic exercises. There are two big boulders standing

    ' It is interesting to note here that the name of the power to whom the youths'

prayers are addressed contains the same radical as is found in the Nootka and

Kwakiutl terms for morning, viz., Koa'-koai'la and Ko'atl, which both signify that
light or day is coming. The same root is found in the Coast Salisli terms for day
identical in form or slightly modified, as Koa-(yil) and Skua-(yil), and which in

these dialects signifies sky also. It is also seen in the terms of both stocks for red

and hhie, and for the terms expressive of Jieat and warmth. There can be little
doubt, I think, that this being was associated in the minds of the suppliants with
the sun, or sky, or light, all of which are intimately connected. I have pointed
out in another paper (see Proceedings of the Royal Society of Canada for 1898-99)
that the Salish and Nootka-Kwakiutl were originally an undivided people, or had
a common origin, the two languages being full of common terms of all kinds
employed in identically the same way, and that between the extreme members of

the stocks, rather than those contiguous to each other, between whom we know

no intercourse or communication has taken place from time immemorial.

in the midst of the village site of the old Lytton people. They are
of irregular shape, 10 and 4^ feet high respectively and about 20 feet
apart. Their perimeters are 31 and 27 feet respectively. After the
Tlkumtci'nmuQ youths had been in the river it was the custom for them
to exercise themselves near these rocks. They would run in succession up
the side on to the top of the lower one, pause there a moment, and then
run down the side facing the other rocks, reach it in three strides, and
leap upon the top. They would then shake their clubs and spears as if
defying an enemy, leap down again, and run at the boulders with uplifted
weapon, as if they were enemies. Those practices have long since been
given up, and the youths of the present day are very different from those

of the past.

                                                                    Canoes.

     The N'tlaka'pamuQoe used three different kinds of canoes, the birch-
bark, cedar, and skin canoe. The commonest and that most preferred for
ordinary use was the birch-bark canoe. Sometimes the place of this
would be taken by one constructed from cedar hollowed from the log in
the usual way by means of fire and adzes. The skin canoe, made by
stretching the skin of an elk or caribou over a fi-amework of wood, was ·
essentially the hunter's canoe, and was mainly employed by him in ferry-
ing himself and his belongings over bodies of water that lay in his path
when out hunting. The paddles for both the skin and bark canoes were
double-bladed. For the cedar canoe a single-bladed paddle was employed.

                                         Archaological.

Under this heading, and as announced in the last report of this

Committee, I had prepared a somewhat lengthy paper, before the

American Museum of Natural History had published Mr. Harlan Smith's

Report on the Archaeology of Lytton and Neighbourhood. But, as this

publication covers the same ground as my own, it will be unnecessary

at this time to publish a second report of this area. I shall therefore

simply add a few further remarks upon the method of stone-cutting

employed by the old-time dwellers in this region, as evidenced by the

partially cut stones themselves, recovered from the ancient camp sites of

this locality. In his report Mr. Smith inclines to the opinion that the

cutting was done by sandstone slips or flakes. That many of the cuts
were effected in this way there can be no doubt, as I pointed out some two

years  ago                the  bevelled  sandstone  grinders  found  in  great  numbers  on
                       ;

the old camp-sites fitting these grooves to a nicety. And that these can

make grooves of this kind in the greenstone boulders I have demonstrated

by grinding them out myself. Indeed it surprised me to find how readily

the hard serpentine or harder nephrite (jade) could be grooved in this way

But all the boulders were not so cut. Dr. G. M. Dawson was informed

by some of the old men at Lytton that the old people' used to cut out

their jade, adzes, and chisels from the block by means of quartz crystals.

Chief Mischelle also made the same statement to me, and explained
further how they effected it. Having selected a suitable boulder, the

stone-cutter would fasten two strips of wood together at a distance of

about half an inch apart, something after the principle of parallel ruler

only the parallels are rigid in this case. This he laid upon the surface of

his block for holding his crystal in place and keeping his line straight

the cutting utensil working to and fro between the parallel bars or strips

                                                                                LL2
51(5 REPORT-- 1899.

When the groove is sufficiently deep to hold the cutter in place, this

apparatus is thrown aside and the cutting is continued without its aid.
Water is used throughout the process to keep the cut clean and open.
Rock crystals of various kinds were employed for the purpose, agate being
a favourite. I have attempted cutting the jade block with an agate
crystal myself ; and, although the progress is not so rapid as with the
sandstone grinder, the crystal soon cuts into the stone, and there can

be no doubt that the boulders can be cut in this manner. And that

they were so cut sometimes in the old days is perfectly clear from the
evidence of the grooves themselves, which in such cases are entirely

different from the curvilinear grooves made by the bevelled sandstone.
They are distinctly angular, and the bottom of the cut narrows to a point,
the outline of the cut having the appearance of a triangle standing on
its apex. Mr. Smith must either have secured no specimens of this
kind of grooving or have overlooked the difference between this and the

rounded grooves given in his illustrations.
     The advantage of cutting with a crystal over the sandstone grinder

would appear to be a saving of material, less of the block being cut away

in the process ; and although there is no scarcity of greenstone blocks, they

are not all of jade or of the first quality, and this fact may have weighed

with the cutter at times. In any case, whatever the reason may have

been, the fact remains that the ancient stone cutters employed both crystal

and sandstone to cut out their adzes and chisels from the rough block.

The polish afterwards put upon these and others of their polished tools and

utensils was effected by first rubbing with rushes and afterwards with the

naked hand. The old Indians would sit for hours together by the camp

fire rubbing a stone in this manner ; and I was informed that the polish

found on some of the highly hnished stone pestles or hammers would take

more than one person's lifetime to effect. I secured some good examples

myof the crystal-cut boulders in  last visit to Lytton.  Some of these are

now in the Provincial Museum at Victoria, and a particularly interesting

specimen I recently forwarded to the Dominion Geological Survey Museum

at Ottawa. This last is doubly interesting from the fact that it exhibits
in itself the two diflferent modes of cutting, some of the grooves being

curvilinear in section and some angular. The workman who owned this

block, however, favoured the grindstone method, for on one of its sur-

faces we find three shallow, rounded grooves, parallel to each other, as if
the cutter had been marking the block off into sections to see how many

pieces he could cut out of it. It is quite possible that the cutter found it

easier to start his cuts by grinding, and when the groove was deep enough
to hold his crystal, he finished the cut by this means. This particular
block favours this idea. At any rate it is perfectly clear that there were
two methods of cutting employed, and not one as indicated by Mr,

Smith.

     I concur with Mr. Smith in his conclusion that there is no evidence
for supposing the old-time dwellers on these prehistoric camp sites to be

of a different race from the present tribes. No evidence as yet has been

»gathered which takes us back more than a few centuries at most.

Mr. Smith secured many skulls from this locality, and it would have been

interesting if the indices of these had been compared with the indices of
the heads of the present N'tlaka'pamuQ. I think they wiU be found
interesting. In speaking of the arrow-heads of this district Mr. Smith
remarked that the prehistoric points were invariably larger than the more
ox THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OV CANADA.  517

modern ones. This appears to me to be a misconception on his part. His

collection of arrow-heads is not as large as mine, nor is he, perhaps, as

familiar with the several varieties as I am ; and from my own observation,

as well as from the reports of others who have worked on thpse grounds,
I should say the i-everse was the case if there is any difference at all, or if
this difference can be determined, which I much doubt. It has always
been considered one of the peculiarities of this district that so many very

small arrow-heads have been found there. I have myself seen scores less
than half an inch in length. Indeed, some of them seemed too small
for practical purposes, but the old Indians say they were undoubtedly
used for game, while the bigger ones were used in warfai-e.

     Another point of interest on which a few further remarks will not be
out of place is the number of knives and ' flakes ' found in these old
burial-grounds. These are at Tlk-umtcl'n commonly formed from a kind

of obsidian, called by Dr. G. M. Dawson augite-porphyrite. At least 75
per cent, of these are chipped on one or more of their edges. On the

other side of the river large quantities of agate, chalcedony, and jasper
of various colours have been found in the old burying-grounds. These
latter resemble closely the flint knives, flakes, and scrapers found in the
old mounds in England. Except for the difference in material it would

be impossible to distinguish between the two. On inquiry from the old

Indians as to what purpose the ancients put these small knives and
flakes to, I was informed they employed them to cut or scarify their bodies,
particularly their legs. ' It lets out the bad blood,' said one old man,

'and makes a man good and strong.' One of the peculiarities of these
flakes or knives is that a considerable number of them are more or less
curved in form. Whether these forms ai-e accidental or otherwise I
am unable to determine.

                                                  Physical Characteristics.

    Owing to the absence of most of the men from Lytton and the neigh-
bouring villages during my last visit to them, and the extreme reluctance
on the part of such of the women as remained at home to be measured or
photographed, I am unable to add any new matter of importance to

our knowledge of the physical characteristics of N'tlaka'pamuQ. Dr. Boas

has already shown that the men of this tribe are a liner and taller race

than their congeners on the coast. This fact is so patent that it requires
no comparative measurements to demonstrate it. This is probably due to

--two distinct causes environmental conditions and intermixture with

non-Salishan tribes. With regard to the first, while the lower Fraser and

coast tribes spent a large portion of their lives squatting in canoes on the
water, the N'tlaka'pamuQ spent the larger portion of theirs in hunting and
land exercise ; and with regard to the second, the presence of two distinct

types among the people clearly reveals itself in their countenances. The
photographs I secured at Lytton will make this quite clear. The differ-
ence in colour, too, is also here more remarkable than in any other group

I am familiar with, and this incidentally supports the evidence I have

set forth elsewhere of an oceanic origin for the ancestors of the Salish
stock. Some of the natives are fairer than the darker races of Europe,
while others recall strongly the dark hue of the Tongan Islanders. They
are more than swarthy ; and the other characteristics of their features are
negroid of the Oceanic type.

     Intermediate types between these two extremes are of course common,
 18 REPOUT-- 1899.

but if a large number of people were brought together the observer would
have no difficulty in classifying them under one or other of the two pre-
dominant types. The same holds good equally, or more so, of the cast of
countenance. In the one we see the high prominent cheek bones, the
squat concave nose, and thick coarse lips ; in the other the cheek bones
are inconspicuous, the nose straight or slightly aquiline and pointed, and
the lips of average thickness. In this latter type the ear is small and
very tinely developed, and sits close to the head.

                                     LINGUISTICS.

     In the following linguistic notes on the Lower N'tlaka'pamuQ, I have spared no
pains to make them as accurate and reliable as possible. I did not content myself

with obtaining information from one or two persons, but checked my notes again
and again with different individuals whenever an opportunity offered. As far as my
notes go I think they may be relied upon as trustworthy and accurate. I am largely
indebted to an educated young woman named Ma'li, who was for many years at the
mission school at Yale, for my knowledge of the grammar and structure of

N'tlaka'pamuQ. She is a member of the Lower N'tlaka'pamuQ.

to fepeat a word two or three times, in many instances, if it be a characteristic
Indian term, the inquirer will be in doubt how to write it on account of the appear-

ance and disappearance of the rough breatliings. A word uttered slowly and apart

from its context has often a different sound from the same word uttered quickly in

ordinary speech. The same words in tlie mouths of women and children are often

quite different from what they are in the mouths of the men. The consonants are
much softer and the aspirates are less guttural, or even wholly wanting, in the

former.

                                  NUMBER,

The noun, I think, has no true plural ; its place is supplied by a distributive

formed by amplitication of the stem, commonly by reduplication of the first syllable of

the word, as skai'uq, man;        skai'akaiu'q, men ; tuo't,                       boy                          tutuo't, boys ; sliinats,  girl
                                                                                                             ;

slasla'nats, girls ; which, in such sentences as the following, appiroaches the character

of a real plural : cicai'a tik skai'akaiu'q 'n tlBn tskau'tl, there are two men in the

boat                              quUl tl .skai'akaiu'q 'n tlEn mita'tluQ,  there  are  several                 men  in  the  church
                               ;                                                                                                                                ;

mucmuccr/ksta, bring four pieces (of wood) at a time.

'J'he plural of the adjective is formed in the same way : as tait, (he is) hungry;

tl'tait, (they are) hungry, when standing as the complement of the rcrbum suhstan-

tivum. Sometimes tlie distributive is formed by epenthesis or diaeresis, but this is

comparatively rare, reduplication being a strong feature in the JSi'tlaka'pamuQ.

                                  INSTRUBIENTAL NOUNS.

    There is a large class of nouns which take a suffix -tEn, and which may be

termed instrumental nouns ; as,

      N'po'eifiSM, bed, i.e. thing to sleep on.      Wcni'-ptKn, ashes.
      N'trko'ap^/'.vi, chair, i.e. thing to sit       N'tuktci'ntew, door,

ment for letting sunlight through.

     Nukoatlnc^B?;, eye, i.e. the part of the
face that lets light through.

     This initial ;t', which appears as a regular preii.^ in most of these terms, is probably
a preposition. There is a prepositional form of this kind ; as, n' tla kua'koa. in the box";
n" tla tci'tuQ, in the house; n' tlen pO'etEn, in bed.

                                  AGENT NOUNS.

    There is another large class of nouns which takes a suffi.^ in ^utl, and whicli carries

           _

with it the idea of agency or action ; as,

stem of the word is reduplicated. This reduplication serves several purposes. It not
only expresses the plural and continuous repeated action as above, but enters also
into the ideas of diminution in several ways.

                                   COMPOUND NOUNS.

    Compound nouns are a common feature of the language. Examples of one class

of these are formed by simple juxtaposition with or without modification : o'iyip-
tsk'au'tl, flre-canoe. i.e. steamer; q'k'"Opa, beaver, from qtluk't = broad and cu'pa =
tail ; n'kEltza-sk-a'qa, horse. Another and commoner class are the ' instrumental
and ' agent ' nouns given above.

                                                                                Gender.

    There is no evidence of grammatical gender in N'tlaka'pamuQ. When a speaker

wishes to distinguisli between male and female he does so either by the use of

separate words ; as,

                                                                 skal'uq, man ;  s'mu'tlatc, woman
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

                                                                 tu'ot, boy ; sla'nats, girl

                                                                 ci'na, baby boy ; ma'qa, baby girl

                                                                 ck-'ca, nephew ; sklumke'st, niece

or, by adding to the class-word in a more or less modified form the terms for man
or woman ; as,

                                             dog, sk-a'-kai'uq ; bitch, smfl-mE'tlatc.

When there is no possibility of ambiguity the class- word is not used, but just one or
other of these two terms, as the case may be.

    A few words are used of male and female alike, without distinction, when there

is no possibility of ambiguitj' or need to mark the sex ; but all these general terms
can, and sometimes do. add the words for man and woman when there is need to be

explicit.

                                                 Doctor, mE'laQmc'it ; sku'kEmIt, child

                                                 ^^!^°^''        1 slEuG'amEt;

                                                 widower, J                                                                   '

                                                 orphan, cua'ka, boy or girl.

    Many class nouns are omitted in common speech when qualified by an adjective,
as in English ; as, ku'tlamin, old man or woman. The full form of these would be :

ku'tlamin tik skai'uq ; ku'tlamin tik smu'tlatc. A great many of the adjectives

may thus be used substantively.

                                                                 Case.

     Ordinarily the noun undergoes no inflexion for case, but in expressions denoting
possession or ownership there is a modification of the stem which might at first
sight be taken for a genuine inflexion ; as, tcltuQ, house; tcI'tuQcha "nska'tza, the

house of my father, or 'n-ska'tza tcituQc, my father's house.

     But this is not a true inflexion ; it is merely one of the affixes of the possessive
pronoun. These affixes are seen also in the intransitive verbs, and are likewise

suffixed to adjectives when they stand as the complement of verbs of incomplete
predication, or of the verbum suhsttmtirinii. Schematically they are as follows :

                      ha-'«-tci'tuQ, my house; ha-tci'tuQ, thy house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

                              ha-tcItuQc, his or her house ; ha-tcl'tuQ/.:Y, our house
                             ha-tcI'tiiQ/T/ji, your house ; ha-tci'tuQJV/«, their house.

     It is interesting to notice that in the first and second persons singular the pro-
nominal elements are prefixed, while in all the others they are suffixed. 'J'he

common prefix /(a- is a demonstrative particle, and signifies the presence of The thing
possessed. It may be replaced by tla, which .>-ignifies the absence of the thing

possessed (see under Pronouns). These particles are abbreviated forms of the
demonstrative pronouns ' this ' and ' that.' They have also the function of a definite
article in N'tlaka'pamuQ in certain constructions.

     The object-noun presents some interesting features. Generally speaking, the
object of a transitive verb follows the verb in an unmodified form, and is distinct
from it ; as,

                                pul'cena tlum smite, I killed a deer
                               kueta'ta smite, cook tlie meat

                            o'ita'ta tcVtuQ, burn down the house;
                             nika'ta cmpuni, cut the wood

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

                              n'saua'ta tzatl, wash the dish.

But sometimes the noun is verbalised, taking on regularly the inflexions of the
transitive verb ; as,

                            pfimata, make a fire ; from spam, a fiie
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

                                n'tuktci'nta, shut the door ; from n'tuktcl'ntEn, a door.

   In other instances the object noun is incorporated into the verbal synthesis in a

contracted modified form betv\feen the stem and the personal inflexion as,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;
    tcxx-kai' n-na,, I struck him on the head, fiom tcuta'na, I strike, and ku'mkan,

head; tcu-ii'cena, I struck his face, from tcuta'na and sk'tlu'c, face; qo'ni-akst-kin,

I have hurt my hand, from qo'nikin, I am hurt, and lakst, hand or finger;

mypau'-c-kin,   face is swollen, from pau'it, swollen, and sk'tlu'c, face, more literally,

I  am  swollen  as  to  my  face                         nIk-qE'n-kin, I cut my foot, from                                                                                                                                          niKkin, I am cut,
                                                      ;

and la'kaqEn, foot or toe.

   It would appear that when the object affected by the verbal action is a person, or

any part of a person's body, such object is almost invariably incorporated with the

verb, as in the examples given above. There seems, however, to be one striking

exception to this rule. When the object happens to be the third person singular, no

incorporation or modification of the object takes place, but the pronoun follows the

verb as in English ; as,

                        Po'ista'na tcinl'tl, I killed him or her
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

                        Tcvita'na tcinl'tl, I struck him or her;

                        CEu'ksta'na tlEna, I know that person.

     In all other instances it would appear that the pronominal object is invariably
incorporated into the verbal synthesis, and placed between the stem of the verb and
the terminal infiexions ; as,

                                               Huz-icj'-n, I love thee
                                            Huz-^e'i-c, he loves us
                                            Huz-fi'^«-na, I love them.

                                    (For other examples see under Verbs.)

    The same principle holds good for the incorporated reflexive pronoun tcut ; as,

                                           Oi-tcu't-kin, I burn myself;
                                                 Quz-tcu't-kin, I love myself.

     It will be seen in the above incorporative nouns that their synthetic forms differ
from their independent forms. This difference consists in the main in a cutting

down of the independent form of the word, which is not infrequently a compound
term. At times a different radical is used, but in such cases, I think, it will always
be found to be a .synonymous term, which has by chance taken the place of tlie
common term. Much of the differentiation in the Salish dialects has been brought

about in this way, a good example of which may be seen in the tel'His for bed,vei'.

In the N'tlaka'pamuQ we find the common word for tliis animal is s'nuya. But the

primary signification of this term is not beaver but 'wealth,' 'treasure,' 'riches.'

Beaver-skins in  the  old  fur-trading days were a  standard of  value                            hence  beaver-
                                                                                               ;

skins are ' wealth ' or ' riches,' and hence the application of the term to the animal

itself. But there is also another term quite commonly employed to designate the

beaver by, viz., qlf'u2Ja, which is derived by severe syncopation from qtlukt, broad,

and cu']}a, tail. Either of these terms may stand for the word beaver, yet neither

of them is the primitive term commonly employed before the division of the Salish

stock took place. The word common to the greatest number of tribes is slie'lu, or

some modification of it. It is the ordinary term for beaver in the dialects of

contiguous tribes, both above and below. It is also used by the Coast and Vancouver

Island Salish, and even bj' one division of the Kwakiutl. It must, therefore, have

been thrust aside in the dialect of the N'tlaka'pamuQ and forgotten, and the

other synonymous terms taken its place, for I could not find it upon inquiry.

The following expressions will serve as examples to show the difference between

the compounded and the independent forms :

The synthetic personal pronouns form two distinct classes, one for transitive and

another for intransitive verbs. This latter class also undertakes the function of the

rerbum svhstaiitivum. It may be suffixed to almost any part of speech, verb, noun,

adjective, adverb, pronoun, kc. For example, in the last sentence in the preceding

paragraph the terminal p in ta'hamui) is the characteristic terminal of this pronoun

in the second person plural, ta'kamop being otherwise written as ta'kamos = all, the

whole. Other examples will be found in other parts of the paper.

The two classes schematically given are as follows :

     Of these there are also two classes, or, more strictly speaking, the pronominal
elements are modified by two distinct particles which have the function of marking
the presence of the object possessed in the one case and its absence in the other ; as.

abbreviated forms of the demonstrative pronouns qaha' ' this,' and tlaha' ' that,' and

consequently signify 'here' and 'there.' The position of the object noun varies.

house of my father. The latter, however, is the more usual construction.

524 REPORT-- 1899

     In the contiguous Shushwap Dr. Boas has recorded ' inclusive ' and 'exclusive'
forms for the first person plural and the possessive pronouns. I have not been able
to discover these differentiations in the Lower N'tlaka'pamuQ d'alect.

                            Substantive Possessive Pronouns.
These forms are used in answer to the question, ' Whose is this?

                            C'ntca'ntl, mine, or it is mine.
            Singular < hawi'ntl, thine, or it is thine, sometimes wintl.

                             Ltcini'ntlc, his or hers, or it is his or hers.

                           I uEme'mEtlk't, ours, or it is ours.
                Plural < pia'pstalEp, yours, or it is yours.

                             I^tcinku'ctatli'gs, theirs, or it is theirs.

    There is another form compounded from a word meaning 'belongings,' 'posses-
sions,' &c., and the possessive iDronoun, and which is the equivalent of our phrase

' this is mine.'

                  --'n cu'tEn, mine, or this is mine.

                                                                                                             j

          --Singular I a cu'tEn, thine, ,, ,, ,, thine.
                 --[ cil'tEn s, his, ,, ,, ,, his or hers.

            rcir'tEnk't, our,      ,, ,, ,, ours.

            Plural cu'tEnfip. yours, ,, ., ,, yours.

              cu'tEnigs, their.",  ,,  ,,  ,, theirs.

            !

    This term cu'tEn is also verbalised ; as, cfl'tEnsta'na, I own it ; cu'tEnmi'na, I hold

possession of it.

                          Interrogative Pronouns.

              squat or cuat ? who .' ex., cfiat Qa ? who is that .'
                              cuat q ? who are j'ou ?

            ha'ntla .' wliich ? ha'ntla wintl ? which is thine?
                 ha'ntla ha sk-a'qa ? which horse is yours ?

T$ut in the question ' wliich of ihem ? ' Aqa'n .' is the correct form ; sta .' what? what
do you want '. stakas hoakst ? Aska'num ? what ? what are you eating ? sta'aopinOq ?
what colour? aska'num mita? nik sta? In what ? In the phrase 'wliich horse is
yours?' the term for horse is abbreviated to ska'qa, which commonly means dog.
This abbreviation is quite common in conver.«ation. The full term in Lower N'tlaka'-
pamuQ is rCg'E'ltza-ska'qa,; in the Tlkumtcr'nmuQ dialect it is intsasli-a'qa.

                               Relative Pronoun.

The N'tlaka'pamuQ rarely, if ever, use relative pronouns as we do ; indeed, I

doubt i[ a true relative exists. But in translating an English sentence with a rela-

tive pronoun in it they sometimes use the particle tas to represent our 'who' or

'which: 'as. tlaha' ko'kpi tas tcutcams. 'The heavenly chief who made me,' but

more often they express themselves thus: Quzte'na tlE'n myklq tla tzok-, I loved

mysister who is dead,' which, literally taken, is rather, 'I love  sister (absent), that

one dead.'

            Emphatic Reflexive Pronouns.

n'tc.au'amatl, I myself.                   nEme'mEtlmatl, we ourselves,
ilwl'matl, thou thyself.
tcinl'tlmatl, he himself.                  plya'pstamatl,                     ,,

                                           tcinko'stamatl,                    ,,

     There is another reflexive form used with verbs, viz., tout, as Oi^(;(77kin, I burn
myself ; kestantcilt, becoming bad in oneself. I have not found this form apart from
the verb.

                               Demonstratives.

            qaha', this.                   tlaha', that.
                                           tla tla ha', those.
            qa qa ha', these.

     In 't. fi, 11, and all the decades of the above the suffix -akst appears. This is an
abbrevi.ated form of liM, hand. To this suffix in 100 is added the synthetic form
for foot, i/K)i. The analysis of the remaining part of the compound is not clear to
me, but the meaning is obviously so many ' hands ' and ' feet.' Nine has the signifi-
cation of ' one less than,' ' one wanting.' Five means the ' whole hand ' or ' fist.'

Six means another added to the whole list.

There is a secondary form for trees, wood, &c., the distinction between which and

the above my informant was not able to make clear to me. Esamplos of this form
may be seen in the following : raucmucc-6k-sta = ' bring four pieces of wood at a time;

pIpi'eokQ = ' iust a few trees,' said by a native when tlie trees or bushes are scat-

tered. The reduplication here seen is a good example of the opposite uses to which

it is put in N'tlaka'pamuQ.  In the one instance  it      expresses  augmentation                                                                   in    the

other, diminution or scantiness.

The following forms are used when counting houses :

1, pia'tluQ.                      4, moca'tltiQ.                7, tcutlka'tluQ.

     The distributive is apparently formed by suffixing the particle tloq to the cardi-
nals. This particle has an independent existence, and carries with it the significa'

tion of ' only ; ' as,

     These are regularly formed by suffixing the particle atl ; as, pai'atl, once
cai'atl, twice, &c. With regard to this suffix it is interesting to note that the same
form is seen in the Kootanie in one of its three kinds of numeral adverbs ; as,
gokwe'ntf!!^, once gaska'tletl, twice, kc.

     The position of the adjective varies witli the construction of the sentence.
Commonly it precedes the word it qualifies, and is attached to it by a kind of
article thus: i'a iliZ; tfi'ot, a good boy. The place of this article is always betv?een
the substantive and its qualifier. It seems sometimes to perform also the function

of a partitive article ; as, kwonam'ata tilt ko, bring me some water; Qoa'kskin tik

snu'ya, I want some money. It must likewise always stand between a numeral and

a substantive; as, pai'a tik tci'tuQ, one house; cicai'a till, skai'akaiu'q, two men.
It is probably the same particle as is seen in the Bilqula dialect under the form ti,
though the functions of the two are not quite the same.

    In such a sentence as ' This house is good,' the adjective commonly follows its

noun ; as, qah'a tik tci'tiiQ i'a.
     Comparison of the adjective is effected in the following manner:

         Positive                                                                    Comparative                        Superlative
                                                                               ttiwa tlikt, sweeter            ki'atik tlikt, sweetest
tlikt, sweet                                                                   Qo'zEm tuwa, greater            ki'atik Qo'zEm, greatest
QO'zEm, great

The superlative form is simply the numeral adjective ' first ' joined to the positive

by tik. This is the ordinary method of comparison, but the following phrases show

that the comparative and superlative may sometimes be otherwise rendered

ohitca'hasi'as  =  ' better                                          '  where  6'hitca means  ' more,'  ha(s)  ' this,' and  i'a(s)  ' good,'
                                                                  ;

and the whole compound is equivalent to our ' this one is more good ; ' kwumkwumet

tik ia, ' best,' ' very good.'

                                             ADVERBS.

     The position of the adverb varies with its sense and the construction of the sen-
tence in which it occurs, but the temporal adverb is invariably placed at the
beginning of the sentence; as, tlaliamVq tlo hazQuztca'moq, always, you have loved

me tlenaqEnos awikta'na tlana', loTig ago I saw him. Speaking generally, the
                   ;

adverbial modifier will be found as a rule before the word it modifies, but there are
many exceptions to this rule.

                                                                               VERBS.

     The N'tlaka'pamuQ possess a verb of being. It enters largely into the composition
of the other verbs in certain of their tenses. It is conjugated by means of suffixes
and prefixes. It cannot be used independently, but must always take a comple-
mentary noun or adjective before or after it. Severed from its complement it is

conjugated as follows :

                                                                               Present Tense.

              r ua'kin, I am.                                                                           wef ila'k't,  are.

                 ua'q, he or she is.
                                                                                                        [ via'tzaq, they are.

    This is formed by suffixing the particle thim to the present tense forms; as,
uakintlum, I was, &c.

kiauEn'ska = if I were good.                k-e'stiienska = if I were bad.

In such sentences as these the complement precedes the main part of the verb

ambut in a simple direct sentence it follows ; as, ii'fikin I'a, I  good.

In composition this verb is not regularly employed as the verbum substantivum in

English is. In the present tenses the personal inflexions only appear in such

sentences as we form with an adjective and the verbum substantivum. Thus :

                   Present Tense.

           rtai't-kin, I am hungry.                  ftait-k't, we are hungry.

                   Perfect Tense.

tloa'qoqtait, thou hast been hungry.

                                            tloatza'qoctait, they have been hungry.

                           Future Tense.

        f ho'Ikin-tait, I shall or I am going to be hungry.

         ·1 holq-tait, thou wilt or thou art going to be hung

                                   tl'ma'taitkin, I may be hungry.

    The other forms follow regularly, the particle tl'ma' = 'perhaps,' being prefixed

to the present tense forms, as in the first person.

    By suffixing the particle Oq or nOq to the above, as tai'tkin-oq, we can get an
intensive or emphatic form of the same expression, I am z-eri/ hungry. Also
kweno'qkin-oq, I am iwri/ sick ; tcE'lcEau'qkin-oq, I am ?wy glad.

    A very constant feature of the verbal system of the N'tlaka'pamuQ is that the

verbal stem is always jireceded by the tense" sign in the future. The meaning of the

amfuture is nearer our ' I  soing; to be ' tban ' I shall be." There is another form of

the future less positive than this, viz., ho'lkiu-nok-kweno'q, ' I am afraid I am going

to be sick.'

The negative forms are thus rendered :

              tata kin.skweno'q, I am not sick.

              tata qa^kweno'q, thou art not sick.

   The negatives strengthen each other as in Greek, the .s here strengthening the
independent negative tata.

    Xoun sentences are formed in the same way as the adjective sentences ; as,

                        N'tlaka'pamuQ-kin, I am a N'tlaka'pamuQ.

                     --,, -q, thou art a N'tlaka'pamuQ.

                                          ,, he or she is a N'tlaka'pamuQ.

                                   ,, -k't we are N'tlaka'pamuQ.

                                             ,, -k'p j'ou are N'tlaka'pamuQ.

     The di.sjunctlvc per-iional pronouns maj' be added to these if empha.sis is needed

as,

                'ntcau'a N'tlakapamuQ-kin, Jam a N'tlaka'pamuQ, &c.

     The distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs is very clearl)' marked
by the use of entirely different pronominal suffixes. The intransitive take the same
pronouns as the adjective as given above, but usually form their past tense by

suffixing the particle Hum ; as,

                                                    Peesent Tense.

               Lkitc tlum, he went.                               (.ki'etc tlum, they went.

     In the past tenses of ihe transitive verb the particle tlum appears to play but a
small part, its place being supplied by the verb ' to be.' This particle tlum, besides
forming the past tense and perfect participle of the intransitive verbs, is otherwise
employed to indicate absence from the speaker ; as, tcinl'tl tlum, he (absent), tcinkost-

tlum, they (absent).

                                                                                                                                              Past of iNcoJirLETE Action.

Singular Quztau'q tlo, thou hast loved.                                                                                                       Plural -j Quzta'p tlo, ye have loved.

Singular Quztau'qiia, thou hast loved.                                                                                                        Plural Quzta'p, you have loved,

               [ Quzta'sua, he has loved.

The distinction between ua and tlO is very nice. The former is used when the

action or feeling no longer exisl-s at the time of speaking; as, tlakamiq-ua hazQuz-
tcamoq. always thou hast loved me (up to this time)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;  the latter when the feeling or

action is continuing; as, tlakamlq-tlohazQuztcamoq, always thou hast loved me and

still dost. It will be noticed in these two sentences that the adverb takes the past
signs and not the verb. They sometimes precede the verb ; as, tlOQuzta'na, I have
loved. The amplification of the verbal stem here observed marks the continuity of
the action and strengthens the adverb.

The indefinite past is frequently expressed by the present without any modifying

particles, the contest or sense of the passage making the time of the action clear
mymyas, Quzta'na tlE 'nklq tlE tzok, I loved
                                                                                                                                              sister who" is dead : more literally, ' I love

that                        sister that one dead.' The past action of the verb is here implied by the

absence or death of the object. Other examples are tcu-uc-Ena, I struck him on tlie

face                        tcu-kain-na,  I  struck him on the head.
                         ;

In these examples of incorporated object the subject pronoun sometimes suffers

contraction as well as the object, as seen in these two instances. Occasionally the

indefinite past takes tli/m                                                                                                                   as, pui'cena tlum smite, I killed a deer.

In verbs formed from nouns or adjectives the imperative inflection is -rfa ; as,

tcimi'matsta,  ' cut it in little  pieces.'  more                                                                                                ;  tzozo'itsta, cut  it in

                                                   literally, ' little it '

big pieces ; mucmuceo'ksta, ' bring four pieces of wood at a time. ' In each of these

expressions the only verbal element is the sign of the imperative -sta.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    _

                                      FOLKLORE.

     In recording the following folk-tales of the N'tlaka'pamuQ, I have
sought throughout to keep them as true to the spirit of the Indian mind

as possible. I was the better able to do this as my informant possessed a

more than common knowledge of English for an elderly Indian. Having
acted as interpreter for many yeai-s to the mission.aripR, and also in the
law courts, lie had a fair command of words. Much, therefore, of the

wording of the stories is his own. I have not sought to curtail or shorten
in any way tlie details of the longer stories, believing these to be of the
highest value in comparative studies. Mischelle is a born raconteur, and
has always taken the deepest interest in the stories and old customs of
his people. ]My method of recording was in the shorter tales to write
the story almost verbatim as he related it. In the case of the longer
detailed ones I wrote down the chief incidents of the story at the time of
recital, filled in the rest from memory immediately afterwards, and then
read the whole over to Mischelle next day to see that I had got it cor-

rectly. By this means, although I am responsible for the English, the

spirit of the stories is Mischelle's.

                                                 Story of the Ell--maiden.

     In the remote days of long ago, when the animals spoke and behaved
like human beings, there lived in the far north an elk-man and his wife.
They possessed an only daughter, and the one grief of their lives was that
no husband could be found for her. The daughter, who had no wish to
remain single all her days, grew dissatisfied with her lot, and determined
to leave home and seek an old aunt, a sister of her father's, who lived
somewhere in the far south. She accordingly set out and travelled by
herself for many weeks and moons. She had not, however, gone far
before her aunt, who was a very wise woman, learnt in a dream that her
 niece was on her way to seek her.

      Now, in the old elk-aunt's village, of which she was chieftainess, and
 which consisted of many keekwilee-houses, or semi-subterranean winter
 dwellings, there were no women or females of any kind. The whole
 community, except herself, was composed of males. Being a wise old
 woman, she foresaw that as soon as her niece should arrive she would be
 pestered to death by suitors for the maiden's hand, and that trouble and
 discord would arise upon her appearance among them. She therefore
 set her wits to work to devise some plan by which she might keep her
 niece to herself and prevent discord and jealousies from disturbing the

 peace and harmony of the village. And this is the way she did it. She

 straightway sent for young Night-hawk, because he had a strong voice,

 and bade him make known to all his companions that if they desired to
 win a beautiful young elk-maiden for wife they should come to her on a
 certain day. Night-hawk soon made the news known to his companions.
 His tidings caused much commotion in the village, and not a youth was

 missing on the appointed day. When all were assembled the old aunt

 told them briefly that her niece was about to pay her a visit, and as she
ON TFIE ETHNOLOGICAL .SURVEY OF CANADA.                                                                                               535

was unmarried would probably desire to have a husband and settle down

with her. ' Among so many desirable youths,' said she, ' I find it difficult

to select one whose claims are greater than the rest. In order, therefore,

that each one of you may have a chance to obtain the maiden I have
decided to let you race for her. You shall all be placed at one end of the

village, and she at the other. At the word " Go," you shall start after her,

and whoever first catches her shall have her for wife.' This plan was not

equally pleasing to all. Young Deer and the other fleet-footed youths

thought the idea an excellent one, each believing that he could easily

snatch the prize from his fellows ; but Tortoise tliought it was hardly fair
to him and his friends, who were not gifted with long and nimble legs.

His objection, however, was overruled, and he and his friends pacified by

a promise of a good .start in advance of the rest. All unconscious of the

excitement the news of her expected arrival had caused in her aunt's

village, the maiden had gradually neared her destination, and was now

but a few miles distant. The old aunt had followed her course day by

day in her dreams, and knew exactly where she was and when she would

appear. So when she was but a little way oft' she went forth to meet and

bring her in. She said nothing to the others as she went, hoping that

she might pass out and in unobserved. But they had seen her stealing

off, and when she returned a little while later with her niece every youth

in the place was on the look-out for them. The maiden was wholly

unprepai'ed to pass the gauntlet of eyes that now met her, and was much

embarrassed by the presence of so many males, and by the ardent glances

they cast upon her. After one hurried look round, she bent her eyes to

the ground, and did not raise them till she was within her aunt's keek-

wilee-house. The excitement in the village now became intense, and the

old chieftainess saw that if she wished to prevent trouble and discord she

must have the contest for her niece's hand settled without unnecessary

delay. She accordingly fixed a near day, and bade all be in readiness.

On the day appointed every youth in the village presented himself at the

aunt's dwelling. The old chieftainess then arranged them for the contest,

placing all the slow-footed competitors in the foremost rank, with Tortoise

in front of all, and Deer and his comrades in the rear. She then led

forth her niece, clad in a beautiful doeskin dress, embroidered from top to

bottom with many -coloured beads and shells, and painted with numerous

Amystic symbols.                                                                   buzz of admiration greeted her as her aunt led her to

the far end of the camp and instructed her to make straight for the house

again as soon as the word was given to start. The aunt then went back

to the others, and, bidding them be ready, gave the word to start. Such

a rushing and striving as then followed was never seen in the village

before, as each youth strove to outdo the others. At the command to go

all had seen the maiden disappear behind the farthest keekwilee-house,

and each endeavoured to be at the turn first. But no sooner had tlie old

woman given the word to start than she exercised her magic powers and

caused the sky to become quickly overcast with thick dai'k clouds, which

effectually shut out the light of day and enveloped the runners in its

bewildering folds, so that none could discern his fellow or see whither he

went. One ran into another and eagerly clasped him, thinking he had

secured the prize                                                                  but, finding  his mistake, let go  his  hold  and  started
                                                                                ;

afresh, only to find himself repeating the same mistake again and again.

' I have her ! ' 'I have her ! ' cried a dozen voices at once. ' Ko, she's

mine ! ' ' She's mine ! ' shouted young Raven, as he grasped the bark of a
536 REPORT-- 1890.

cedar tree which was hanging loose and fluttering in the wind, and tore

it off in his excitement, thinking he had caught the maiden by her dress,

which had given way in his hand. ' She is mine ! I have her ! ' he repeated

again, as he grasped the tree in his arms. But before he could realise his

mistake he was dragged back fi-om the tree by a dozen hands, and had to

take up the hunt again. And thus they strove in vain to find the maiden,

until they had torn the clothes from each other's backs, and the light of

day had returned once more. ' Who's got her ? ' ' Where is she ? ' was

now the cry all round ; and, to the astonishment of all, no one seemed to
have secured the prize. She had escaped them all, and, moreover, was

now nowhere to be seen. While all these frantic struggles in the dark

had been going on, the old aunt had run round tlie other way and led

back her niece into the house again, and, taking off her beautiful dress,

had straightway hidden her in a large basket fashioned like a cradle,

which she had prepared for the purpose. This she placed on a shelf just

under the roof, where no one would be likely to investigate and discover

its contents. Every one now wondered what could have become of the

maiden, but none save crafty keen-eyed Lynx suspected that a trick had

been played upon them by their chieftainess. It was commonly supposed

that the sun, observing the beautiful maiden as she ran, had become

enamoured of her, and had left his abode in the heavens and come down

Howand seized and carried her off. '  else,' argued they, ' could you

account for the sudden darkness of midnight at noonday 1 ' But Lynx

thought otherwise, though he said nothing. He, like the others, had

entered the race, but, finding himself outstripped at the commencement,

gave up the contest, and kept his keen eyes upon the chieftainess. He

thought he had seen her run round the other side of the house and return

again with her niece, but was not quite sure, as the darkness had baffled

even his keen sight. Nevertheless he inclined to the belief that the

maiden had returned to her aunt's dwelling, and even now lay concealed

there, and he determined to satisfy himself on this point before long.

For several days and nights, therefore, he hung round the old woman's

keekwilee-house, making all sorts of excuses to pay her sudden and

unexpected visits. At one time he would take her a fine salmon, at

another some rare roots, and at another a haunch of venison ; but enter

as often and as suddenly as he would, no trace of the maiden could he

see. Having failed in this plan, he had resort to another.

On each occasion that he had visited the old aunt's house since the

girl's disappearance he had noticed the large cradle-basket on the shelf.

He could not remember to have seen it before, and from its appearance

it was plain that it was not an old cradle ; so he could not help connect-

ing its presence with the disappearance of the maiden. He vowed he

would learn by some means the contents of that basket before long ; but
as there was no chance of doing this openly he must find some other way.

So accordingly one night, when the whole village was asleep, he stole to

the roof of the old woman's house and began sniffing over the spot where

he knew the cradle lay, and having a keen nose soon assured himself

that the maiden lay there asleep. Having satisfied himself on this score,

he now carefully and quietly removed a little of the bark covering from

the roof, thus making a small hole therein large enough to peep through

and see the maiden sleeping soundly beneath him. Enlarging the hole

a little, he thrust in his paw, and gently removing the blanket from her

breast spat three times upon her abdomen. He then replaced the
ox TFIR ETHNOLOGICAL SUHVEY OF CANADA.  537

blanket, restored the liole as before, and slunk home to his own quarters.

For three successive nights he repeated this action, after which he

returned no more, but went about his business as usual and awaited

results. In the meantime life had not gone very merrily with the

maiden. Pent up in her narrow quarters she grew wearier each day as

the weeks went by, and begged her aunt again and again to allow her to

come out of her basket. But this the old chieftain ess would not do.

But as time went on the maiden presently discovered herself to be in a

peculiar and distressing condition. It seemed as if she would shortly

become a mother. When the first consciousness of her condition dawned

upon her she would not believe it, but as the days went by she could no

longer entertain any doubt of it. .She hid tlie matter from her relative

until it was no longer possible to do so, and then the aunt was angry

indeed, and bitterly reproached her niece for the disgrace she was bring-

ing upon her, and would not at first believe that the girl herself was

innocent in the matter. But having presently convinced herself of this,

she set her wits to work to discover who it was that had outwitted her

in this way. But though exceedingly wise and versed in much magic she

yet could not discover directly who the offender was, but was obliged to

get her information in a roundabout way. But now the maiden's full

time had come, and she was delivered of a male child, who grew in an

incredibly shore space of time into a strong and vigorous boy. The old

chieftainess, having thought out her plan of action, now sent once more

for her public crier, young Night-hawk, and bade him inform the village

of the birth of a child to her niece, and tell his companions that they

were all to present themselves at her house on a certain day, and bring

each of them a present for the child.

This they all did, with the exception of two, each burning with

curiosity to learn when the maiden had returned, and who had secured

her for wife. The bidding of the tribe to her house was part of the old

aunt's plan for discovering the father of her grand-nephew. By her

magic powers she had learnt that if each visitor presented the child with

a gift, he would accept and retain one only, viz. the present offered by

his own father, and would reject with disdain those of all the others.

Thus she would be able to discover the perpetrator of the deed. On the
day appointed each brought his present. As they descended they oflered

their presents one by one to the child, who took them, only to throw

them aside again the next moment. This happened until all the presents

had been made, and all the visitors had assembled. As the child had

shown no interest in anything that had yet been offered him, the old

woman knew from this that some one must be absent. She therefore

angrily demanded who had disobeyed her injunctions ; and after some

little delay and calling of names it was ascertained that Young Rabbit

Aand his brother Lynx were absent.     messenger was immediately

despatched for them, and in a few minutes they arrived. Rabbit descend-

ing first. As Rabbit clambered down the notched pole that served for

ladder, the child now for the first time evinced some interest in what
was going on, and looked up and smiled at Rabbit and held out his hand

for the present. For a moment he seemed inclined to play with it, but
threw it aside at once when he perceived Lynx descending. As the latter

approached he crowed and laughed and clapped his hands with delight,

eagerly stretching them out for Lynx's present, which he retained and

immediately began to play with. The old chieftainess knew from this
538 REPORT-- 1899.

that the child's father stood before her. She now related to the assembled

guests all that had taken place.
     Pointing to Lynx, who hung his head in silence, she exclaimed,

' What shall be done to a creature guilty of such meanness ? Death is

too good for such a one. I will tell you what shall be done to him. . . .

He sought to rob me of my niece ; now that he has disgraced her he

shall have her whether he will or no ; but he shall possess her in loneli-
ness ; he shall not live with us. I have been thinking of changing camp

for some time past ; we will do so now, and leave him and the girl and
child behind to look after themselves as best they may.' As they left
the house every one of them, even Lynx's own brother. Rabbit, gave him
a kick or a cuff, so that by the time all had gone poor Lynx was a mass

of bruises and sores. When all had at length left, the girl, who had been

watching the wliole proceeding in shame and anger, now came forward

and washed and tied up poor Lynx's battered head, mildly reproaching
him the while for the trouble and disgrace he had brought upon them.
Meanwhile the others were busy preparing for the departure across the
water, which divided their present encampment from the country beyond.

There were many among them who, while they felt no pity or com-
passion for Lynx, were yet sorry for the girl ; and in packing up their

food stores purposely left some scraps behind for her in their food- cellars.
In a short time they were ready to start, and the old chieftainess giving
the word, they paddled away, leaving the pair behind them. The old
aunt had left very little of her store of food behind her, so that in a few
days the forsaken couple found their larder empty. Then it was that

Lynx remembered that there were other food-cellars in the village, and
suggested that the girl should go round and see what she could find in

them.

     She soon discovered the food that was left behind ; and, poor and
scanty as it was, she was grateful for the kindness of those who had
thought of her in this way, and promised herself that if opportunity
offered she would not forget their kind acts. The food thus secured lasted
them till Lynx had recovered from his wounds and was able to go out
hunting. But the night before he was to start he had a dream, and in
his dream his guardian spirit came to him and told him not to despair or
be downcast at the turn events had taken ; that he would assist him, and

that one day he would be a great man and rule over his tribe. He was

further instructed to prepare a bow and arrows after the pattern shown
him in his dream, and go to the woods at the back of the village, and
there he would always find game in plenty. Accordingly, next day, after
relating the dream to his wife, he fashioned himself a bow and a quiver

of arrows, after the pattern he had seen in his dream, and went forth to

hunt. He had scarcely left the village behind him when fat deer sprang

up on all sides. Having killed as many as he deemed enough for them,

he returned to the village to inform his wife of his good luck, and to
secure her help in bringing home the game. From this time on they had
game and skins in plenty, and lived upon the fat of the land. So plenti-

ful indeed had all kinds of food now become that that precious possession,
mountain goats' and sheep's kidney fat, was as common as meat, and the
boy was given a ball of it to play with ; and so much had the wife thrown
away through the smoke-hole that the roof was coated with congealed

masses of it.

     J^ow things were quite otherwise on the other side of the water. SooTi\
              ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SrRVEY OF CANADA.                         oo9

after elk-woman and her people had settled there all the game had

suddenly disappeared, and now the best and keenest hunters could find

nothing to Ijring home after a long day's hunt. Famine was busy among

them, aiid they were anything but happy in their new quarters. This

state of things had been going on for some time, when one day Raven

took it into his head to fly across the water and see how the deserted

Lynx and his family were faring. Greatly exhausted by his exertions in

his half-famished state, he was glad to alight on the ridge-pole of Lynx's

keekwilee-house. Recovering himself he looked round him and could

scarcely believe his eyes when he saw a chubby child actujilly playing

with a ball of precious kidney fat, as if it were of no value at all. Seizing

an opportunity, when the child had rolled the ball of fat towards him, he

pounced down upon it and, urged partly by hunger and partly liy greedi-

ness, strove to swallow it whole. But the ball was too big for his mouth

and stuck in the back of his throat. The child, seeing Raven gobble up

his plaything, set up a howl, which speedily brought out his mother. Per-

ceiving what had happened she seized Raven by the neck and forced him

to disgorge the ball again. Then, giving him a good shaking, she

demanded from him what he was doing there, robbing the child of his

plaything. Raven confessed that he had flown over, out of curiosity, to

see how they were getting on, and, being very hungry, could not resist

the temptation to swallow the ball of fat when the opportunity was given

him.          ' But how came you  to  be  so  starving ? ' questioned  the  woman
                                                                                                     ;

' you are surely not short of food over the water.' ' Indeed, we are,'

responded Raven ; ' we are worse than short of food, we are all starving.'

Ah'   !       said the woman,  ' you have rightly fallen upon  the  lot  you desired
           '

for me. Go back to your companions and tell them I rejoice to hear of

Mytheir misfortunes.           husband and I shall enjoy our food the more from

knowing your stomachs are aching with hunger.' She spoke thus bitterly

because Raven's presence recalled their desertion of herself and child.

But Raven pleaded so hard for a meal first that she relented and gave

him as much meat and fat as he could eat, and told him he might come

over every day and get a meal on condition that he did not tell the others.

This Raven readily agreed to. When Raven first flew over he was thin

and poor, but after a little while the genei'ous diet began to .show its

effects upon him, and he grew plump and saucy once more, while his com-

panions grew thinner and thinner. His condition soon attracted atten-

tion, and his comrades began to suspect that he knew of some stores of

food which he selfishly kept to himself. So one day they seized him and

threatened to kill him if he would not reveal the source whence he

secured his food. At first Raven was true to his promise, and would

disclose nothing ; but seeing that his companions were in earnest, and

would undoubtedly kill him if he hid the matter from them any longer,

he confessed that he had been going to the old settlement, and had been

generously fed by Lynx and his wife, who were living in plenty. On

hearing this they determined to pocket their pride and return to the old

camp the very next day. In the meantime, while they were making their

preparations. Raven iiew over and told Lynx and his wife what had

transpired. The woman, on hearing the news, recalled the promise she

had made to herself, and ha.stened to stock the food-cellars of those who

had thought of her in her distress. She filled their cellars with the
choicest game and fat, but put not a morsel in the cellars of the others.

Next day, when the tribe returned, those whose kind actions had borne

 fruit feasted upon Lynx's game as they had not feasted foi* a long time
 before. The others, whose cellars were as empty as their stomachs,
 gathered round Lynx's keekwilee-house and eagerly picked up and

 devoured the scraps which the woman had purposely thrown out. Little
 Ant and several of his relatives climbed on the roof and began to eat the
 fat that had gathered there. For some days neither Lynx nor his wife

 would show themselves, but each morning they threw out a basketful of
 bones and pickings, which were quickly seized and devoured by the

starving crowd. When the woman thought she had sufficiently humbled

 their pride and revenged herself for their cruelty to her, she bade her
 husband make a great feast and invite them all to it. This he did, and
 when they had eaten their fill he told them of his vision and the promise

his guardian spirit had made to him. From this they perceived that he
was ordained to be their chief. They accordingly denounced the old
chieftainess, declaring that she should have known all this, and, deposing
her, they made him cliief in her place.

     Thus Lynx's dream was fulfilled, and he became a great man among

them from that time forward.

                           Tla'pas Cima'ms, or the Forgotten Wife Story.

     There was once a young man who was very desirous of becoming a

great ' medicine ' man, or Shaman. Following the usual custom of the

Indians he retired to a solitary spot that he might be alone. He sub-

jected himself to the severest discipline, fasting till his body was so
wasted that his bones almost came through his skin, but he met with no

success. No dream or vision came to him ; no spirit promised him its

aid and help. Giving up the trial in despair, he resolved to go and visit

a certain famous Shaman who lived in another part of the country. On

his journey thither he came upon a secluded village through which his
path ran ; and, as it was near night, he resolved to stay there till next
morning. To his surprise he found the village deserted, but for one
old woman. Going up to her he saw that she was very old and decrepit,
so old, indeed, that she could not sit upright, her body falling forward
between her knees as she crouched over the embers of a decaying charcoal

fire. By her side was a basket of koakoe'la, or ' husband ' roots ; while

from every joint in her limbs and from each side of her head there grew
out young fir-trees. These appeared to incommode her considerably, and

as soon as she saw the young man she begged him to cut them for her.

Being of an obliging nature, and seeing that she was extremely old, and
probably wise and gifted with supei-natural power, he complied with her
request. She then begged him to make her a little fresh charcoal for her
fire and place it by her side. This he did also, and then began to question

her as to why she was all alone and why her people had deserted her.
' They have not deserted me,' answered she, ' they are all dead, I have
outlived them all. I am very old, so old that the fir-trees grow upon me

as you have seen.'

     ' But how have you managed to live so long ? ' questioned the youth.

' Because my " medicine " is good,' she answered. ' See these roots at my
side ? That is my "power."' I have eaten nothing but these since I was
a girl. In their strength I have lived on, while all my kinsfolk have died

and passed away. I have learnt, too, to read the secrets of the heart ; I

know your ambition and the object of your journey through the forest,
          ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  541

But you will not attain your desire unless I assist you. This I will do in

return for your kindness to me. Take this root, peel off the skin, and eat

it when you are going to rest for the night, carefully preserving the root

itself for the future. In your sleep you will have a dream. Come to me

in the morning and tell me what you dreamt, and I will advise you of

your future course.' The youth took the root, promising to do as she bade

him. Before he lay down to sleep he carefully skinned the root as he had

been bidden, and then ate the skin, putting the root aside. In his sleep,

as the old woman had foretold, he had a strange and peculiar dream. He

dreamt that he had arrived at the Shaman's house, and had been sent by

him to perform three herculean tasks, which if he accomplished he was to

have the Shaman's beautiful daughter to wife, but if he failed he was to

be cast to a fierce and dreadful beast, which the Shaman kept in a den for

the purpose of devouring the bodies of the young men who failed to

accomplish his tasks. Next morning he related his dream to the old

woman, who then told him the nature of his first task, adding that if

he succeeded in accomplishing this he would receive help and advice

from another source with regard to the others. ' You will have to clear

a large tract of forest land in a given time ; and so dense is the forest,

and the time allowed to do the work so short, that you cannot possibly do

it of yourself ; but if you will be careful to follow my instructions you

will be enabled to perform the task within the allotted time and outwit the

Shaman. When he takes you to the field and asks if you will undertake

the work, answer boldly, 'Yes, if you will supply me with a suitable

Hetool.'  will at once consent to do this ; then ask to see his mattocks.

When they are placed before you laugh at him, and ask if he thinks you

can use such children's tools as those. He will be surprised, and ask you

what kind of tools you want. Request him then to have a mattock made

for you that will take the strength of twenty men to lift. He will be

astonished, but will do as you request.' 'But,' interrupted the youth,

* what shall I do with such an unwieldy instrument as that 1 I am not

stronger than twenty men.' ' Be patient and listen,' replied the old

woman. ' The root I gave you last night is a " magic " root. Eat a

morsel of it now and test it.' The youth bit oft' a mouthful, and before

he had finished chewing it he felt a strange power enter his body, and

with it a desire to exercise his strength. 'Take up this log,' said the

old woman, 'and swing it round your head.' The youth obeyed, and took

up a log that required the strength of a dozen ordinary men to lift, and

swung it round his head as if it had been a spear-haft. ' Now,' said the

old woman, when he had cast the log to one side, ' you need not fear the

weight of your heavy mattock ; only if you desire the root to be eflective

you must give good heed to my instructions. You will be tempted to

partake of the food from the Shaman's table before you set out to perform

your task. This you must on no account do. Turn your back upon his

breakfast and satisfy your appetite with the root I gave you. Eat it on

an empty stomach and have confidence in its virtue, and you will

successfully accomplish your labours.' The youth thanked the old woman

for her good advice and the root, and, bidding her good day, continued on

his way. On the following day he came to the residence of the great

Shaman. As he approached the house the younger daughter of the

Shaman saw him coming, and perceiving him to be a goodly, well-favoured

youth, her heart went out to him, and she was moved with pity, knowing

the e\-il that awaited him at her father's hands. When he arrived at tlje
M2 HepoRt--1899.

house the Shaman came and asked him what he could do for him. The
young man answered that he sought to become a Shaman, and desired his
aid and advice to that end. ' Very good,' said the Shaman, ' I am willing

to help you on certain conditions. You must become my servant for a

time, and must undertake to perform certain tasks which I will set you.
If you succeed in accomplishing these I shall see that you are fitted to

become a Shaman, and will initiate you into the mysteries of my profes-
sion, and will also bestow upon you one of my daughters for wife.' ' On
these terms,' broke in the youth, ' I am willing to become your servant,
and attempt the tasks you may set me.' ' Stay a while, my friend,' said

the Shaman, ' you have heard but half the conditions. If you fail to

accomplish either of your tasks you will be cast to the fierce beast in the

den yonder,' and he pointed to a huge and fearful-looking creature which

was penned up near the house, and which now roared horribly as the
Shaman spoke. The sight of this ravening beast might have deterred a
less determined man than this youth, but remembering his dream and the

power which was his by virtue of the old woman's root, he again declared
his eagerness to essay the tasks and enter upon his novitiate. ' Very

good,' said the Shaman with a wicked smile, ' to-morrow morning you

shall begin your work. Come and I will show you your first task.' And

with that he led him to the forest. ' To-morrow before sunset you must
clear and prepare for planting seventy " fathoms " square of this land,'
said the Shaman when they had reached the timber. ' Very well,' replied
the youth, to the Shaman's astonishment, who expected to hear him cry

out and declare such a task to be impossible for any man ; ' I will do the
work provided you supply me with proper tools.' ' There are plenty of
mattocks in the house,' said the Shaman ; ' I will have them brought to
you and you can choose your own.' When the tools were placed before
the youth he laughed at the Shaman, as the old woman had bidden him,

and said they were children's tools, and that he wanted a man's tool.

' What kind of mattock do you want 1 ' then exclaimed the Shaman, more

astonished than ever at the manner of the young man. ' I will give you

whatever tool you require.' 'Very well,' then said the youth, 'have a

mattock made for me that will require the united strength of twenty men
to move it, and I will clear your land for you.' The Shaman, marvelling

much at the confident manner of the youth before him, promised that the
tool should be ready for him at sunrise next morning. On the morrow

the young man was up before daybreak. He went to the stream and

plunged into the cold water ; he then exercised himself after the custom

of the Indiaii youth of the old times, after which he made his breakfast
of the hoakoc'la root. This, not being very large, only served to whet his
appetite ; and when the Shaman presently invited him to sit down to

breakfast with himself and family, the savoury smell of the fish and

venison sorely tempted him to comply, but remembering the admonition

of the old woman he thrust aside his desire, turned his back upon the
meal, and went forth to his task. He had no sooner left the house than

he felt a rush of energy and strength to his body and limbs, and catching
up the newly made mattock swung the huge implement with ease round
and round his shoulders. Without loss of time he betook himself to the
forest, and such was the marvellous power of the koakoe'la root that ere
the sun had reached the zenith he had cleared the piece of land and felt

little the worse for his task. He now returned to the house, and the

Shamauj seeing him coming, wearing a bold and self-confident look.
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                                                                    543

Scarcely knew what to think ; and when told that the work was done
would not believe it till he had examined it with his own eyes. Finding

the task really satisfactorily performed, a great hate now sprang up in

his heart towards the youth, and he secretly determined to cut his life

short, lest he should prove a future rival to himself and rob him of his

influence and power. To this end he prepared a snare for him. Pre-

tending to be well pleased at the manner in which he had performed his
first task, he told the young man that he would not wait till he had

accomplished the other tasks before giving him his daughter to wife, but

would bestow her upon him that very day. The young man, nothing

loth to possess so desirable a wife as one of the Shaman's daughters,

asked which of the two was to be his wife. Said the Shaman, ' Choose for

yourself, my son                                                        you may have which  you  like.'  The youth looked at
                                                                     ;

the two young women, and to his surprise found them so exactly alike

that he could not tell the one from the other, and was at a loss for the
moment which to choose, till he caught the soft and yearning look in the

eyes of the younger, whose heart he had unconsciously won, when he

hesitated no longer, but chose her. ' Very well,' said the parent, ' I will

prepare a house for you, and to-night you shall find both it and her ready

for you.' Now the young woman's love for the youth made her suspect

her father's motives, and feigning complete indifference for her future

husband she sought to discover her parent's purposes. He, never sus-

pecting that her feelings had been roused, or that she cared one jot for the

youth, made no secret of his purpose. He had caused a deep hole to be

made in the ground, just before the door of the chamber he had prepared

for the newly wedded pair, at the bottom of which he had built a huge

fire of charcoal, and over the top of which, on a level with the ground, he

liad placed a cunningly contrived door that revolved on a central pivot.

This door was so evenly hung that it remained balanced by its own

weight, effectually covering the hole and the fire beneath ; but should one
not familiar with the contrivance be unwary enough to place his foot on

either half of the door, it would immediately give way beneath and pre-
cipitate him into the yawning furnace below, from which there was no

possible escape. This was the bridal couch the jealous Shaman prepared

for his unsuspecting sdn-in-law, and the latter would doubtless have thus

miserably ended his life but for the love and warning of his bride.
Having ascertained that her father entertained no doubts that his trap

would successfully dispose of her lover, and that they would be left in

peace, at least for the night, if he succeeded in passing the death-trap, she

took the opportunity, unobserved by her sister or parents, to acquaint her

husband with the whole plot, telling him how to safely cross tlie door.

He saw from tliis that his young wife's help was the aid the old woman

had told him would be given him after he had performed the first task,

and feeling that some friendly power was working for him, he awaited

the approach of night without agitation or concern. When they had

eaten their supper, and the young women had retired, the Shaman pointed

out to the youth the apartment occupied by his bride, and left him to

join her. As he approached the door he trod very carefully, trymg the

ground in front of him before he put his foot down. When he had got

quite near the door he felt the ground give way beneath his advanced

foot, and pressing upon it a little discerned the outlines of the trap-door
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and putting his foot in the centre, as his wife had instructed him, he gave

a leap and crossed the treacherous spot without harm, and the warm wel-

come of his bride soon made him forget the danger he had run in reaching
her. Next morning, when the Shaman, according to his wont, aroused
his family, he was greatly astonished to see the young man appear safe

and sound from his daughter's quarters ; but dissembling his feelings he
bade him good morrow and hoped he was ready for his second task that

day. O' yes,' responded the youth, ' I am quite ready and eager.' When

he had gone for his morning plunge and exercise, the father took the
opportunity of warning his wife and daughters that they were on no

account to give the youth any hints or advice. ' He has some powerful

medicine,' added he, ' working in his behalf, or he could not have accom-
plished the task I set him yesterday or escape the trap I placed for him

last night. If I do not destroy him I foresee he will outwit me and
deprive me of my prestige and power.' He little suspected that his

younger daughter had already revealed the nature of his second task he
proposed to set him, and had conspired to outwit him and assist her hus-
band. But so it was ; for before they had risen that morning she had

told him that her father would change herself and sister and mother into

three beautiful speckled trout, so exactly alike that it would be impos-

sible to tell one from another without assistance from the fish themselves.

Said the young wife, ' I will wag my head from side to side as I swim
about : by this means you will be able to distinguish me from the others
when you are asked to point me out, without exciting my father's sus-
picions that I am helping you ; for,' added she, ' the task that awaits you

to-day is to point out which of the three fish is your wife. Be careful not
to point me out at the very commencement of the trial. Pretend for a
while to be in doubt, and declare the task to be impossible, and only

when you have exhausted my father's patience make a real and final
effort.' The young man promised to do as she had bidden him, and

thanked her for her good advice.

     All breakfast-time the Shaman was very merry and talked much,
telling the youth how many young men had come to him to be initiated
into the mysteries of Shamanism and had proved themselves unworthy,
and had been cast to the beast and been devoured. The youth was not
to be dismayed by the misfortunes of those who had tried before him and
failed. Secure in the love and assistance of the Shaman's own daughter,

and mindful of his dream, he maintained, to the Shaman's secret chagrin,

the same self-confident air that he had worn on the previous day. As
soon as the morning meal was over, the Shaman bade his daughters fetch
a large basket-tub and fill it with water. As soon as they had done this

he called the young man to him and said, ' Now you must essay your

second task, and if you fail, notwithstanding your success of yesterday, I

shall cast you to the beast.' Transforming his wife and two daughters
therewith into three speckled trout, so exactly alike that it was impossible
to detect the slightest difference between them, he cast them into the

basket of water and bade the youth come near. After watching them for

a moment he asked the young man which had the smallest tail. ' It is
impossible to say,' replied the youth ; ' they seem to me to be exactly of
the same size.' ' Which has the largest head, then ? ' questioned the
Shaman. ' I cannot say,' said the youth. ' Which has the finest fins 1
' They are all equally fine,' was the answer. And thus the Shaman ques-

tioned him upon all their points, always receiving a similar answer from
the youth, as his wife had instructed him. The Shaman then put the

real and final question : 'Which of the three is your wife, my youngest
              ON THE ETIIXOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                                              515

daughter 1 '  ' Really, I don't think I can say,'  pretended  the  youth                          ' it
                                                                                               ;

seems impossible to determine.' ' Oh, but you must,' declared the

Shaman, now so delighted that he could scarce hide it, ' or pay the

forfeit.' And as h'e spoke he pointed to the beast, whicli roared horribly
at the same moment. The young man then put forth his hand as if to

point out the tish he tliought his wife, but immediately withdrew it again

with a show of doubt and hesitation. He repeated this manoeuvre several

times until the Shaman, losing patience and believing that the youth
was now in his power, declared he must hesitate no longer, but make his

choice and abide by the result. The youth then closely watched the

three fish for a moment, and seeing one separate itself a little from the

other two and shake its head vigorously, he quickly pointed to it and

said, ' That one is my wife and your younger daughter.' As he uttered
the words the three fish were transformed back to women again, and

stepped out of the basket. The Shaman was so disappointed at the turn

events had taken that he could scarcely hide his feelings, but making

pretence, he congratulated the youth, declaring that one day he would

become a very great Shaman if he were lucky enough to be successful in

his third and final trial, which was fixed to take place on the morrow.

The next morning, before they rose, the young wife informed her

husband that the task which awaited him for that day was a race with

her father, who was so exceeding fleet of foot that no man had ever

successfully competed with him. 'You cannot of yourself,' said she,

--* hope to beat him his medicine is too strong for that. I alone can aid

you, and if you will place your trust and confidence in me I can promise

you success. When you find my father gaining on you in the race and
your strength failing, you must fix your eyes steadfastly upon my face,
and you will then find yourself able to outrun him. Do not neglect my

instructions, or ill will it be for both of us.' He thanked her for her help

and advice, and made up his mind to do as she had told him if he found

he was losing ground.

The Shaman presently called him aside and informed him that he

must now prepare himself for the third and final trial, ' which,' said he,

' is a race with myself.' The youth prepared himself accordingly, and
presently stood side by side with the Shaman, svaiting for the moment to

start. The three women had gone to the other end of the course to see

the finish. The signal being given they started, and ran neck and neck

for the greater part of the way. But as they approached the goal the

Shaman began to make use of his medicine and leave the youth behind.

The latter strove again and again to overtake the Shaman, but all his

cfTorts were in vain : he found himself slipping farther and farther behind,
and it was only when his strength began to fail him, and the Shaman was

almost at the goal, that he recalled his wife's instructions. Quickly fixing

his gaze upon her face, he felt in an instant a sudden rush of energy to

his limbs as her eyes seemed to burn through his brain, and his feet

seemed as if they had taken wings to themselves, for they now carried

him along without any effort of his own, and landed him at the goal

I several yards in advance of his father-in-law, whose rage and disappoint-

      ment were now so great that he could not speak for anger. But still he

dissembled and acknowledged his son-in-law's victory, and forthwith
undertook to initiate him into the mysteries of his profession if he would

settle down with him and become his pupil. This the youth consented to

do, being still wishful to become a Shaman. But the Shaman's daughter,

his wife, was troubled in her mind, knowing that hdr pareilt would nevef

spare her husband's life, but would continue to plot against him till he

had destroyed him. So when night came, and she had an opportunity of

conversing with him alone without arousing suspicion, she communicated

her fears to him concerning his safety under her father's roof, and coun-

selled immediate and secret flight to his own village and home. The

youth assenting to her plan, they set out together that very night, making

all the haste possible that they might be well advanced upon their journey

before they were missed. In the morning, when the Shaman roused his

family as usual, he was surprised to And his daughter and son-in-law

absent, and as the day advanced, and there was no appearance of them, he

became convinced that they had fled together from him. Said he to his

wife, ' Now I understand where his assistance came from. Our daughter

has betrayed me, and now run away with her husband. But they shall

not escape me thus. I will after them and bring them back.' And as he

spoke he sought for their trail, which, as they had made no attempt to

hide it, trusting to their start, he soon discovered and hastened to follow

up. With the aid of his Shamanistic powers he was able to travel much

faster than they ; and he had not pursued them long when the runaway

Mydaughter cried out to her husband : '  father is pursuing us and is

close upon us ; T know it by the trembling in my body. Now stay a

moment, and I will use my medicine.' Forthwith she transformed her

husband into a little sugar-tree ' where he stood, and herself into another

close by over against him ; and where a moment before two human beings

had stood there now grew in their place two old and partly decayed

sugar-trees. The transformation had scarcely been effected when the

Shaman came up. When he reached the sugar-trees he found the trail

suddenly stop, and look and search as he would he could find no continua-

tion of it. Casting his eyes around him, he presently perceived that the

trail ended at the sugar-trees, so having the power to converse with trees

he addressed them, and asked if they had seen a young man and

woman pass that way. The sugar-tree that was his daughter replied that

no one had passed by that way since they had grown there. ' How long

have you been growing here ? ' questioned the Shaman. ' Oh, we are very

old,' said the daughter. ' Cannot you see how decayed we have become ?

Never suspecting that he was conversing with his daughter, after search-

ing all round again and finding no clue to follow, he gave up the pursuit

and turned back homewards again. When he was out of sight the

daughter resumed her proper form, transforming at the same time her

husband to his own shape, and both continued on their way as fast as

they could. The Shaman, on reaching his home, was asked by his wife

why he had returned alone. He related his experience, telling her that

the trail was clear and easy till he came to the sugar-trees, and then it

ceased suddenly, and no trace of the fugitives could be found beyond.

' You silly man,' said the wife, ' don't you see that the sugar-trees were

your daughter and her husband ? You know that she possesses the

" power " as well as you. Hasten back after them, and don't be fooled by

her again.' Perceiving that she must be right, he started after the run-

aways once mca-e, and presently arrived at the spot where the sugar-trees

had stood, which were now nowhere to be seen. Desperately angry at

finding he had been outwitted again by his own daughter, as his wife

had suggested, and perceiving the trail broad and clear before him, he

hastened to overtake them once more. It was not long after this that

Mythe young wife cried out to her husband, '                                                                                                father is pursuing us again,

and will speedily overtake us and seize us if I do not do something to

prevent it. I know it by the trembling in my body.' Immediately she

set to work to gather two bundles of brushwood. This done, she trans-

formed them into two wretched, broken-down huts, and herself and

husband into a pair of decrepit and grey-headed old people. She had no

sooner accomplished this second metamorphosis than her father arrived,

and finding the trail stopped short here, he accosted the old couple and

asked them if they had seen two young people pass that way. The

daughter answei'ed for both again, and replied that no one had passed that

way for many years. * Have you been living here long ? ' questioned the

                                                                                                                           ;

'It is strange,' replied the Shaman, ' here are their tracks to this very spot,

and no sign of them beyond. Perhaps they have hidden themselves in your

houses.' 'You are welcome to look,' said the woman, ' but I am sure they

are not there.' The Shaman tlien made a close search of both hovels, but

found no trace of those whom he sought ; and after a fruitless effort to

discover the trail beyond the huts gave up the search and returned home

once more. As before, no sooner was he gone than the pair, resuming

their proper forms, started off again on their journey without delay.

When the Shaman arrived home he related his second experience to his

wife, who laughed at him again for not perceiving in the old pair another
ruse of his daughter's. ' The old man and woman were your daughter and

her husband without doubt. Return quickly and you will still secure

them.' The Shaman set out yet a third time after the runaways, and

coming to the spot where the cottages had stood a little while before dis-

covered nothing there but two heaps of brushwood, beyond which he now

clearly discerned the tracks of the fugitives. Taking up the trail again

he hurried after them. As he was aljout to come up with them the young

woman cried out, ' I am all in a tremble again : my father is close upon us.
I must use my power once again, and if we succeed in deceiving him thi.s
time he will molest us no further.' And with that she spat upon the

ground and the spittle became at once a lake. She then transformed her-

self and husband into a pair of mallard ducks, and entering the water

bade her husband follow her. They liad been in the water but a few
moments when the Shaman came up, and finding the trail lead into the

water he stopped and looked about liim. Understanding the language of

birds he now accosted the ducks and asked them if they had seen a young
man and woman cross the lake. The daughter, answej-ing for both, as

she alone knew the language of birds, replied shortly that they had

not. The Shaman then requested them to swim over to the other side of

tlie lake and see if they could disco^-er any tracks leading out of the water.

Said the female duck ' Go, and look for yourself ; we cannot wait upon you.'
The Shaman, though by this time weary and footsore, dragged himself round

to the other side of the lake, but perceiving no footmarks there concluded

that the fugitives had drowned themselves, and presently returned home

and gave up the chase. The young people, starting on their way once

more, shortly came near the young man's home. As they approached the

village he said to his wife, ' Now, I want you to remain here in the wood

while I go forwai'd and prepare my mother and father for your arrival.'

She demurred to this, asking why she could not accompany him.                    Oh'
                                                                                                         !

that would never do,' said he ; ' my parents must have time to prepare for

your reception. I will only go forward and inform them that I am

bringing home a wife and then return for you.' She continued to demur

to the arrangement. ' Have you any brothers ? ' questioned she presently.

' No,' he answered, ' I have no brothers, only two sisters.' ' Promise me,

then,' said she, ' that if I let you go you will not let your family kiss you

Whybefore you return to me.' '  do you wish me to make that promise 1 '

asked he. ' Because if your sisters or your father and mother kiss you

before you come back to me you will forget all about me and will not

return, but leave me here all alone in the woods.' The young man, who

was very fond of his wife, declared that was impossible ; but willing to

gratify her he readily promised to do as she requested, and bidding her

have no fear of his speedy return he left her there and entered the village.

He had not got far before his two sisters perceived him coming, and rushed

in to inform their parents, who no sooner heard of his arrival than they

ran out to meet him, followed by their two daughters. When they got

near they embraced him fondly, and he, in the pleasure of meeting them

ao^ain, forgot all about his promise to his wife, and suflered himself to be

kissed by them. And as they led him into the house all recollection of

his young wife aiixiously waiting for him at the edge of the forest left his

mind, and he forgot her as completely as if she had never existed. When

he had been absent some hours and night began to come on without any

si"n of him, she began to fear that he had broken his promise ; and as day

after day went by she became certain of the fact. So she built herself a

little house on the edge of the village close to the roadway, and at the

back of it she added a small lean-to. When she had done this she took a

lump of clay, and after kneading it she made from it two clay birds. She

next transformed the clay effigies into real live birds, and placed them in

the lean-to at the back of her house. Several days had now elapsed since

she had lost her husband, who, having completely forgotten that he had

ever been married, at the suggestion of his parents began to look round

for a wife . Having chosen a maiden that suited his fancy, he asked his

parents to take the necessary steps to bring about the marriage. Nego-

tiations were opened, presents accepted and exchanged, and a day was

hxed for the ceremony. The father of the bride-elect was desirous of

marking the event in a very conspicuous manner ; so he gave notice that a

"reat feast would be held in honour of the occasion, and sent out invita-

tions far and wide. He also invited all those who possessed any curious

or intei-esting things to come and exhibit them, being determined to make

the feast a memorable event. The forsaken young wife at the edge of

the village heard the news of the approaching marriage of her husband in

Asome mysterious way, and laid her plans to prevent it accordingly.

day or two before the feast a young man chanced to return from the

forest whither he had gone to gather roots for the feast, by the path that

led past her hut. As he passed the door she came out and asked him

what he had in his basket. ' They are roots,' answered he, ' that I have
Ahbeen gathering for the feast.' '
                                    !      said  she,  'that  is  just  what  I  want

returned he ; ' they are for the feast. But let me take your birds instead ;

   we want all the meat we can get.' ' No, I do not want to part with my

birds,' replied she ; ' but come in awhile and talk to me.' The youth,
perceiving her to be a very agreeable and pleasing young woman, nothing

   loth, acceded to her request, and entered the hut with her. She now

pretended to make love to him, and he, falling into the snare, desired to

   spend the night at her house This was what she desired for her purpose,

   and bade him welcome. When they were about to retire for the night,

   and he had disrobed himself, a sudden commotion took place among the

   birds in the lean-to.     ' Oh   !       cried she,  'I   have   forgotten                  to  place  my  pets
                                         '

   on their pei'ch. Do go out and set them on the perch for me.' He

wanted her to leave them as they were, but she insisted that he should

first set them on the perch before he lay down. Thinking it best to

humour her, he went out, undressed as he was, and tried to set the birds on

the perch ; but no sooner had he placed one on it than the other tumbled

oft" again. When he had spent a little time thus to no purpose, he cried

out to her that they kept falling off the perch, and that he must leave

them as they were. But this she would not hear of ; he must set them

on the perch or he could not return to her. Being anxious not to vex

her, this he again tried to do. But so contrary and perverse were the

birds that they fell off as fast as he put them on. As he now began to

feel cold in his undressed state, he begged again and again that she would

allow him to leave them and return to her ; but each time she made his

return conditional upon his permanently setting the birds on the perch,

and laughed at him for his stupidity in not being able to do so simple a

thing. But do what he would the birds slid off their perch as quickly as

he placed them on it, and dawn began to appear before he at last succeeded

in getting them to remain there. Glad that at length he might now

return to her, he eagerly rushed into the house as the first beams of the

sun shot across tiie sky. He found the young woman up and dressed,

and when he would fain have spent a little while with her in amorous

dalliance she coldly bade him hasten away before the village was astir,

and he was seen leaving her house by the elders, thus bringing disgrace

upon himself and her. This argument appealed to him so strongly that

he forthwith caught up his clothes, and without stopping to put them on

I'an from the hut to the village, and got home before he had been seen by

any one. In his haste he had left his basket of roots behind him, which

was just what the Shaman's daughter had planned for. But such an

experience as the youth had gone through could not be kept long to him-

self ; and before the day was over he had related it to several of his
comrades, one of whom, fired by his account of her attractions and beauty,

determined to pay the young woman a visit himself that same evening.

' You will not succeed,' said the first youth, ' any better than I did ; she

is not so easily won as you think.'                 ' Oh,    won't  11                  retorted   the  other ;  'I
                                                                                     '

will carry some string with me and tie the creatures to their perch.' So

when evening arrived he took some string in his clothes and a basket on

his arm with some roots in it, and passed by the young wife's house, as his

comrade had done. She came to the door and asked what he had in the

basket. ' I am taking home some roots for the feast to-morrow,' said he.

'  Oh,  sell  them  to  me,  won't  you     1       requested  she     ' I want some roots                       for

charms and beauty, and made him ready and willing to do whatever she

bade him. He said he would like to spend the night at her house. To

this she pretended to assent, and when he was about to lie down, having

disrobed himself for the night, a disturbance taking place as before in the

bird-house, she begged him to slip out quickly and set her birds on the

perch for her, declaring they would give her no peace if they were not

placed on the perch. Thinking himself a match for the stupidity or per-

versity of the birds, he made no demur to this, and as he thought he would

be returning in a moment or so he did not trouble to clothe himself, but

went just as he stood. He experienced just the same difficulty as his

comrade had done the previous niglit. The birds would not stay on the

perch ; and when he tried to tie them with the thongs he liad brought he
found that the task was not so easy as he had imagined. Again and

again he thought he had securely fastened them, but just as he turned to

leave the birds slipped each time from the perch, and set up such a cackling

that he was fain to try again. At last he succeeded in getting them to

remain on the perch, but by this time the morning was Ijreaking, and as

he entered the hut the sun showed himself on the edge of the horizon, and

he knew he could safely linger no longer. Moreover, the young woman

was now cold and distant to him, and repulsed his advances, bidding him

return to the village liefore he brought disgrace upon them both. Re-

solving that on his next visit to her he would not be so easily fooled, he

caught up his clothes and ran hastily into the village. The talk of the

young men among themselves soon noised abroad the fact that the stranger

on the edge of the village possessed a pair of remarkable birds. This

presently reaching the ears of the father of the bride-elect, he sent a special

messenger to request the young woman to be present at the feast and ex-

hibit her odd pets. This was just what she had all along been working for,

and she readily consented to be present and show her birds. Accordingly

she came, and stood among those who had some tricks or exhibitions to

make ; and when they had gone through their parts she came forward and
placed her two birds on a mat in front of her husband and the chief guests.

Her husband scarcely noticed her, and certainly no thought of his relation

to her entered his mind. When she had set the birds down she took from

a basket at her side some of the roots she had secured from the youths

and threw them to the birds. The male bird instantly gobbled them all

up, driving the female away ; at which, to the great astonishment of all,

the hen bird began to speak in human language and upbraid and reproach

Whyher greedy spouse for his selfishness and gluttony. Said she, '  won't

you let me eat of the roots 1 I did not treat you like that. Don't you

remember how kind I was to you when my father would have killed you

by letting you walk into the hidden fire 1 And this is the return you make

to me ! I did not think you could be so unkind and forgetful.' Every-

body wondered what the bird meant by such strange words. When it

ceased speaking the young Shaman was seen to look perplexed and

puzzled, as if he were trying to understand something that was not yet

clear to his mind. The young woman now threw the birds some more

roots, whereupon the male bird did as before, drove the other away, and

Howate the roots himself. Again the hen bird reproached him, saying, *

can you treat me so unkindly 1 Don't you remember what I did for you

when my father changed me and my sister and mother into trout and you

had to declare which fish was your wife or be thrown to the fierce beast

ai^d devoured ; ' Her words, however, made no impression upon the cock,

who each time the young woman threw them roots drove his mate oflPand
ate them all up himself. But as the hen recalled to the memory of the

selfish cock her deeds of past kindness one after the other, which corre-

sponded exactly to the acta of the young Shaman's lately forsaken wife,

his memory became clearer and clearer until in the last scene of this little

domestic drama of the birds, when the hen said, ' Didn't I tell you that

you would forget and forsake me if you allowed your sisters and parents

meVto kiss you before you returned to  the full memory of the past

suddenly rushed to his mind, and in the young woman before him exhi-

biting her birds he recognised his forsaken and forgotten wife. He sprang

up with a great cry and embraced her before the whole assembly, calling

her by all the dear names he could think of. His action caused greal,

astonishment to those present, but lie explained that the stranger was his

wife, and told them how he had won and lost her. Even the bride- elect

and her relations could not complain, and he was permitted to withdraw

from the proposed marriage. Compensation in the form of presents was

made to the father of the disappointed young woman who had so strangely

been robbed of her prospective husband, and another suitor' was found

for her.

   Stori/ of the Admntures oj Siiiklu'p ' the Coyote, and his Sun N'tlikcu'mtum.

    In the old, old days Snikia'p lived all alone by himself. He had
neither wife nor children. He much desired a son, and being a medicine-
man of great power it was not difficult for him to obtain his desire. One

day he got a lump of pitch,'- and, working it in his hands for a while,
fashioned it in the form of a human being. Having done this he laid it

on the ground and stepped over it three times, saying at the same time,

' Rise up.' After the third time the elfigy rose upon its feet and became

a living being. He now bids his son to be exceedingly careful never to
go where it was hot. ' Hai-m will come to you, my son,' said he, ' if you
do. When the weather is very warm you must go and swim in the river,

and when it is cool you can safely come home again.' The boy, who

steadily grows, followed his father's instructions carefully for a time ; but
after a while he gets tired of passing the best part of the day in the water.

So one day he finds a large flat stone on the bank and lies down upon it
in the sun. The sun's heat soon begins to act upon him, and in a short

time he melts away. When evening came and he did not return as usual,

Snikia'p goes out to look for him, and presently discovers the melted pitch

on the ground. He now determines to create another son for himself who

     ' Dr. G. M. Dawson has veoonled a brief account of tlie doings of Snikiil'p the
Coyote, from notes supplied him by Mr. J. W. Mackay, in his 'Notes on the Sluiswap

myPeople of British Columbia,' Trans, lioi/. Soc. Canada, sect. ii. 1891. According to

informant, Chief Mischelle, of Lytton, an exceptionally intelligent and well-informed
man, the name should be written as I have transliterated it. I have heard it called
Shnikia'p by the Indian?, and also by Mischelle himself once. In the month of the
Indians of this region the dental sibilant .s commonly changes into the corresponding

palatal .«/(, the speakers being apparently unaware of the change themselves. Accord-
ing to Dr. Dawson the Shuswaps of Kamloops call this being Skila'j). Snikia'p is
the N"tlaka'pamuQ for Coyote. The Coyote always goes by this name in the stories

(see below). This Skild'ji, or Snikia'p, is frequently confused in the stories with

Skoe'qt-koatlt, the Culture-hero of the N'tlaka'pamuQ. See the writer's account of the

doings of this hero in the Transactions of the English Folklore Society for this year.

     ^ Dr. Dawson has also recorded a brief account of a story similar in part to this

should not be subject to the disadvantages under which the other had

laboured. As he "was thinking out of what material he should make him

this time, his eyes fell upon a jade boulder lying on the bank.  Oh'  !      said
                                                                          '

he, ' that is a fine material. I will make a jade son.' So he took the jade

boulder and fashioned it into the form of a boy, going through the same

ceremony of stepping over it three times as before. When the stone son

was come to life he admonished him never on any account to go near the
water or try to swim in the river, or he would surely suffer for it. The

jade-lad observed his commands for some time, but being very hot one

day, and the water looking cool and tempting, he forgot his father's in-

junctions and plunged into the river to bathe. Immediately he sank to

the bottom and was drowned. When Snikla'iJ learnt that his stone son

had disobeyed his injunctions and was drowned, he made yet another son

for himself. On this occasion he fashioned him from the fibrous matter
of certain vegetables and shrubs. He observed the same ceremonies as

before. This time the boy could do anytliing or go anywhere without

harm. When the boy had grown into a big lad, Snikla'p proposed that

they should go and pay a visit to a great tribe some way oft". The people

of this place were celebrated for their skill and power in hunting and

Myfishing, and in wood splitting. Said Snikla'p to his son, '    medicine

informs me tliat they will try to kill us by means of a great conflagration

they will bring about. You must therefore practise jumping until you

are a great jumper. They will try to kill you first in another way. They

will give you a fine-looking woman for wife, and also a spear, and send you
to spear salmon. When you go to the river you will see salmon with hair

on them, and painted salmon, and animal salmon with legs, Be cai-eful

not to spear any of these. Spear a good eating sahnon and hold this rush

in your hand all the time,' and Snikla'p gave the lad a magic rush. ' When

you have speared your salmon,' he continued, ' hold on tight to your speai',

and you will be pulled into the water.  Don't be alarmed at this you
                                                                                                                                                          ;

will not drown. As soon as you are in the water open the rush I have

given you with your fingers and get inside of it. You will find that you

can do this, and you will then float down the river. In a little while you

will drift to the bank. Get out then, and you will see the salmon again.

Use your spear again when a good salmon passes you and spear two.

Take these home with you. When you arrive you will find them making

preparations to kill me. When they see you they will desist.'

       When Snikla'p and his son arrived at the village of this tribe, every-

thing happened as Snikla'p had foretold. The boy followed his father's

instructions, doing exactly what he had told him. On getting back with

the fish he finds the people about to kill his father, not expecting his

return, thinking he would fall into the snare they had set for him and be

drowned. Wlien they see him approaching, they desist from their attempt

to kill his father and propose that they should all go hunting. This they

do ; and when tliey are out they fire the bush in several places, so that
Snikla'p and his son are surrounded by a great ring of fire. They are

both much burnt and scorched, and only manage to escape with their lives

by taking immense leaps over the burning grass and timber. The fire has

Wespread everywhere and no spot is safe. '  must find a trail,' said

Snikia'p, ' or we shall be lost.' After jumping about a good deal they at

last come out upon a broad trail. They lie down on this with their faces

to the ground, and the fire passes by them, having nothing to feed upon

in the beaten path. But they wei-e much scorched by the heat, and the

Coyote has ever since worn a yellow skin in consequence. After a time

they get up and follow the trail, and presently come upon a strange

village, where the people are kind and hospitable. The son now marries

two wives, the daughter of the eagle and the daughter of the duck. The

lirst had red hair and a red face, and the other had light hair and a white

face. The youth now travels about a good deal ; he is also a successful

liunter. He grows rich and becomes the possessor of many shell beads ^

A(Stiak'), of a species of the dentalidiv, and tine clothes.  son is born to

him by his eagle wife. One day he goes out hunting with his father and

his wives and child. Since he has been married his fathei-, who now

desires a wife, has envied him very much and cast longing eyes towards

his daughters-in-law. At night they camp out, and the old man kindles

a fire of cedar wood. This, after the manner of cedar wood, shot out so

many sparks that the eagle-wife drew back from the fire to escape the

sparks which fell upon her dress. The duck-wife, on the conti-ary, sat on,

only pulling up her legs. In sitting thus she exposed the lower part of

her body and legs to her father-in-law, Snikia'p. From this time he

schemed to deprive his son of his wives and take them for himself. He

therefore climbs a tree, and in its topmost branches builds a bird's nest, de-

falcates in it, and transforms the excrement into young eagles. This he did

on the second day of the hunting, when his son was absent. He had

remained at the camp for the purpose. "When the son returns in the

evening he hears the cries of the eaglets and looks round to discover the

nest. Snikia'p now comes forward and says, ' I discovered an eagle's nest

in this tall fir to-day, and by the sound of the birds they must be almost

ready to fiy. If I were you I should climb the tree and get them. Eagle's

feathers would look well with your other ornaments.' Now, as eagle's

feathers were a great prize, not easy to get, the youth determined to follow

his father's advice and climb the tree and secure the young birds before

they flew away. The crafty father was not only desirous of securing his

son's wives for himself, but also his handsome robes, and so when his son

would have climbed the tree as he stood in his clothes he suggested that

he should first take them ofi" and leave them at the foot of the tree for

fear of injuring them. The son, suspecting no guile, did so, and climbed the

tree naked. When the son had climbed a good way up the tree the father

began to draw and distort his face, screwing up first one eye and then the

--other. Thereupon the tree began to grow up up it went into the clouds,

carrying the climber with it. Presently, when the point shot through

the clouds, they closed upon it like a vice and held it fast. Meanwhile

the son had reached the nest ; but when he got there, instead of young

eagles, he finds only human excrement. He now seeks to return, but finds

his way down the tree barred by the clouds. He cannot get down. He

now perceives that his father has duped him, and he sits down and cries.^

Presently he gets up and walks forward. He continues walking all the

rest of that day till night comes on. He now feels cold, for he has no

clothes on, but he lies down and covers his body as best he may with his

long hair. The next day, and for several following days, he walks on till

he hears a sound of knocking. He now looks about him, and the smell of

proceeds from them. They are pounding up fir branches for food. One

of them presently gathers up the pulp and passes a portion of it to the

other. The youth intercepts the food and eats it himself. The old woman
who should have got it now begins to grumble at her sister for not giving

her a share of the food. ' I did give you your share,' retorted the other.
' I put it into your hand. I felt you take it.' The other declared she
hadn't got it. ' Well, here's some more. Hold out your hand and be care-

ful to take it this time.' The other held out her hand, but the young man
intercepted the food again, and ate it himself. The old woman who was

lieing thus robbed now began to get angry, and upbraided her sister for
selfishly keeping all the food for herself. The other defended herself, and
declared she had passed the food and felt her take it. ' Now, give me
your hand once more and let me put it in the palm of it,' said she. Again
did the youth seize the food, and the two old women now began to revile
each other. Presently one of them began sniffing and smelling, as if she

Howscented something strange. Said she, ' I smell N'tlikcu'mtum.' ' '

do you know it is N'tlikcu'mtum 1 ' said the other ; ' you have never seen

him.' ' Well,' answered the first, ' there's nobody but ourselves and the
spider and his wife in this country. They are not here, and you say you
didn't get the food I put into somebody's hand, so it must be N'tlikcu'm-

tum.' The youth now reveals himself and speaks to the old women. ' He

chides them for quarrelling, but as they have done him no great harm,
only called him N'tlikcu'mtum, he will not put an end to them outright,
but will transform them into something useful. Taking one of them by

the nose, he said, ' You will be good meat for the hunter when he is far
from home and bigger game is scarce,' and therewith threw her to one
side of him and she became a willow-grouse. He then took hold of the
other in the same way and threw her into a ' sugar-tree,' ^ and she straight-
way became a black-grouse, or tcuk-tcukt,'' commonly known as the
 ' booby-grouse.' ' You will be of service now too,' said he, ' and hunters
will easily snare you and pull you off the branches by noosing you. You

 will both of you now be much happier because you can both see to gather
 and eat your food when you are hungry.' Thus were the willow- and

 black-grouse brought into being. He now proceeds on his way, and

 seeing some pretty flowers growing by the side he plucked one. It

 came up by the root in his hand, leaving a small hole in the ground.
 Now, as the crust of this cloudland earth was very thin, this hole went
 right through to the other side and let the wind up. It rushed through
 with some force, and he put his foot over the hole to stop it up. From
 this point he travelled on, still in his naked state, till he came to some

 forest land, the sight of which much cheered him. Presently he sees

 some smoke rising in the air. He hastens in its direction, hoping to find
 somebody who will help him. On getting nearer he perceives a keekwilee-
 house before him. He approaches it quietly and peers down the smoke-
 hole, and sees an old man sitting within as naked as himself, engaged in

       ' This term has reference to the flirty trick played upon him by his father. It

rolling ^TpSk' tzin (Andepias speciom) on his thigh into i-ope.^ This old man
was Ska'kit, the Spider, whose home is in the clouds. On seeing the
shadow caused by the youth he looked up and perceived hiin. As soon
as his eyes fell upon him he began to weep and lament. O' dear wife,'

said he, ' here is our grandson all naked and cold. Bring some blankets

and skins for him.' To the youth he cried out, ' Come down, dear grand-

son ; I am so sorry for you. I know how badly you have been treated by

your fathei'.' The youth descends, and they cover him with blankets and

make him lie down by the fire and give him food to eat. Next morning
mthe grandson rises early and goes out to bathe
                                                 the stream. As he

leaves he sees his grandfather, Ska'kit, busily spinning the Spa'tzin gra.ss

into rope, coils of wiiicli lay a])0ut the house. After some days had

elapsed, aiad he luid recovered from the fatigues of his long journey, he

began to grow weary of doing nothing besides watching his grandfather

spin Spa'tzin into rope. So he .said to his grandparents, 'Have you any

Wegame in this country 1 I should like to go hunting.' '  always snare

our game here,' said the grandfather. ' I never shoot, although T have an

arrow.' ' Give me yon arrow, grandfather ; I am a great hunter and I will

shoot you lots of deer.' Ska'kit gave him the arrow, and thereafter he

went out hunting every day. One day, as he was leaving, he said to his

Whygrandfather, '  do you, spin so much Spa'tzin 1 You are always making

rope ; what do you want so much for V ' It is for your sake I spin so
much,' responded the Spider. ' I am going to help you get back to your

own country again.' Said the youth, 'I am happy here with you ; I don't

wish to leave you.' ' That is quite right and proper for j'ou to desire to

stay with us,' said Ska'kit ; ' but this is no country for you. For me it
does not matter much where I live. I can go where I want to. I can

just stick my thread on anywhere and climb up or down as I wish, or let

the wind carry me where it will. Bvit you can't do this, you see, and you

ought to return to your eagle-wife and little son. They want you very

much, and are grieving over your absence. I shall soon have enough I'opo

now for my purpose.' The youth said no more, but the next time he went

out he plucked four hairs from the lower part of his abdomen and threw

them on the ground. Immediately three or four acres of the land adjoin-

ing the stream became covered with fine Spa'tzin grass. When he returned

home he asked his grandfather where he got his supplies of Spa'tzin from.

' Oh, we have to go a long way to get it,' answered he ; 'it does not grow

hereabout.' ' That's odd,' said the youth ; ' I certainly thought I saw a

fine tract of it just beyond the stream. When you go down to the stream

next, just see if I am not right.' Ska'kit went down to the stream shortly

after, and found the grass growing there as his grandson had said, and as

it was unusually fine and long he now soon finished his rope. When this

was done he bade his wife bring out the goat-hair blankets she had woven.

The grandmother fetched out four dozen of these. ' Now bring the dried

meat and fat,' said Ska'kit. And she brought out four dozen prime pieces.
He then told her to get the cradle-basket she had made for the occasion.
When all lay before the Spider he said, ' The pack will Ise too big ; we

must make it smaller. Shut your eyes, both of you, and don't open them

till I tell* you.' They did so. He then closed his own, and waving his

hand over the blankets and meat the four dozen of each was reduced
apparently to two dozen each. ' It is still too big,' said he. ' Shut your

eyes again and I will make it smaller still' He did the same as before,

and the two dozen blankets and pieces of meat were reduced to the com-

pass of two of each kind. ' Now,' said Spider to his grandson, ' I will

Wetell you what we intend to do.  are going to put you and your pack

in this cradle, and cover it up and let you down through a hole by the

Spa'tzin ropes to your own country again. But you must be careful to

heed my instructions and do exactly what you are told, and then all will

go well with you. Between us and your country are three different zones
or lands through which you must pass to reach your own. The first of
these is the land where we now are. This is Cloudland. After that comes
Water-land. Tliat is where the rain comes from. Next to that is Fog-

or Mist-land. After that comes the Earth, your country. Now when we

let you down from this place, after you have descended some distance you

will feel the basket stop. You must on no account get up or look about

you. Lie down in your basket and rock it from side to side. In a little

time you will break through the obstruction and descend again. This

will occur in your descent four times. Do as I have told you each time.
After the fourth stoppage you will find that you descend no more. Open
your basket then and get out, and you will find yourself in your own
countrv. When you get out pull the rope four times, and I shall then
know you have landed all right, and we will pull up the basket again.

Now get into the basket and lie down, and we will cover you up. Take

this sword with you,' continued he, ' as a present ; ' and the grandfather

gave him a long stone sword. The youth now got into the basket, and
when they had covered him up the old man lifted up a large stone that
lay at the base of the ladder and disclosed a deep hole. Down this

Ska' kit and his wife, standing on either side of the hole, let the basket

containing N'tlikcu'mtum and his presents by the Spa'tzin rope. When

the basket had descended about a half-score feet it stopped, being buoyed

up Ijy the resistance of the wind that blew up through the hole. Finding

the basket would not descend, notwithstanding the rocking of N'tlik-

cu'mtum, Ska'kit bade his wife stoop over the hole and make the basket
heavier. The old woman thereupon squatted down over the hole and
scratched her thigh and leg till the blood ran freely and dropped down
upon the basket cover, but before it reached the basket it was changed
into big flakes of snow. This so weighted the basket that it was able to

overcome the resistance of the wind and descend again. Ska'kit and his

wife now commenced to dance and sing as they lowered the basket. The

song was a repetition of the following term, tzuka'-thlQa, thus uttered :

tzuka'-thi-i-i-i-I-i-I-Qa, tzuka'-thi-I-i-i~I-I-i-i-Qa, &c.

     In the meantime the youth experienced the stoppages his grandfather
had wai'ned him of, and each time he felt the basket stop he rolled it from

side to side as he had been instructed. After the fourth time, finding the
basket remained stationary, he threw open the lid, and on looking out

found himself in a fine country. So he steps out and perceives that the

basket had landed on a large flat stone, close by what is now known as

Lytton Creek. ^ He now pulled the rope four times in succession, and the
basket is presently withdrawn to the upper regions again. He now takes

up his pack, but finds it and the big stone sword rather much to carry at

once. He decides to leave his sword there where he descended and get it
some other time. He thrusts it into the trunk of a tree that grew near

the spot to hide it, where, as the old Indians believe, it may be seen to

this day in the form of a peculiar knot that traverses the whole width of

the trunk. On looking about him he now sees tracks of many people, as

if a large party had passed that way. These he follows, and presently

perceives at some distance before him two old women who are swin<^in<^'

fir branches from side to side of them as they proceed along. He wonders

why they are doing this, and on overtaking them questions them about it.

They tell him they do it to mark their sympathy for a very sad and dis-

Whyconsolate young widow who is a little way ahead of them. '                                                                                            is she

so disconsolate ? ' asks he. They answer : ' She mourns continually for

her young husband who has been evilly treated by his father, who sent

him into Cloudland, from which he cannot return.' 'Oh yes, he can, and

has ! ' said he. ' I am the young woman's husband, and I have just

descended by the help of my grandfather, Ska'kit. Look at me and you
will see for yourselves.' 'We can't see you,' said the old women.

Why' ? ' said he. ' Are you blind 1 ' ' No,' answered they, ' but we can't

see you.' 'Look on your right and tell me what you see there.' 'We

can see Cia'kut ' (Thompson River), said they. ' Tell me now, what do

                                                                                                                   '

(Fraser River). ' Yes, you can see,' said he. 'Now look at me again.'
And with that he waved his hand before their eyes and became imme-

diately visible to them, and they knew him. Then said he to them, 'You

did wrong to walk as you did ; I must punish you. But as you did it

out of sympathy for my wife your punishment shall not be severe.' He

thereupon transformed them into maggots, and then proceeded to overtake

his first wife. As he approaches, his little son, who is sitting on his

mother's shoulder, looks back and sees him coming. He cries out,

' Papa                                      papa !                                    This makes his mother's heart ache afresh, and she
                                         !                                    '

chides him and bids him be quiet. But the child still cries out in a joyful

tone, ' Papa !                                                                        The mother gets angry and strikes the child with a stick
                                                                                   '

she is carrying in her hand. Still the child calls again, ' Papa ! ' By this

time the father is at the mother's side, and takes her by the arm. She

does not look round to see who it is, but cries out in a sad, weary way,

Why' Oh, let nie alone ! let me alone !                                                                                                    are you always worrying me ?

'Look up,' said the husband; 'I am your husband come back to you!'

Recognising his voice she looks up and embraces him warmly, and they

both cry for joy at meeting again. They sit down together, and the

father takes his son in his arms and plays with him. They have cried

and rubbed their faces so much that they are quite smeared and dirty.
To remove these stains he causes by his power a spring to bubble up

where they sat. At this they wash themselves. This spring is said to be

the one close by the trail that leads from Lytton to Britta'nF, a summer

resort of the Lytton tribe, about four or five miles north of the old camp

site, lying in a very beautiful little valley between the Thompson and the

Fraser. On this occasion it would appear the whole tribe had gone to

the valley. While they thus sat talking and enjoying each other's com-

pany the larger of the two maggots, into which the two old women had

been turned, passed by. They enjoin upon her strictly not to reveal his

presence to any one in the camp. She is only to tell their slave. Little

Crow (CIoq'), to build their tent somewhat apart from the rest. The slave

did as she was told, and aroused the other slave^ Big Crow's (Ca'haQ)
curiosity. Ca'haQ was servant to the second wife, who now lived with

Snikla'p, her father-in-law.

N'tlikcu'mtum and his faithful wife did not come into c&mji till it was

dark, and no one was aware of the former's presence. After they had

retired Big Crow crept up to the tent to listen. Now the young wife

had been in the habit of crying and mourning every night for the loss of

her husband. Big Crow was aware of this, and wondered why the young

"wife was not crying as usual. She peeped into the tent and noticed a

fine white blanket, which seemed to cover two persons. This further

roused her curiosity, and she ventured to enter the tent very softly. But

the woman heard her, and looked up and said, ' What do you want 1
Ca'haQ answered : ' Oh, I came in to see how you were.' 'I am all right,'

responded she in a happy tone of voice, wholly unlike her usual tones.

This the Crow noticed at once, and asked, ' Is any one here with you to-

night ? ' ' What makes you ask that question ? ' queried her mistress.

Answered Crow : ' To judge by the sound of your voice you seem much

happier than usual.'  ' You are right, I am happier,' said the young wife
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

My' I have reason to be.      husband has come back to me.' The slave now

began to cry for joy and sympathy. Said the young man, ' You must not

cry like that. Come here to me.' Ca'haQ went over to the young man's

side. The wife now asks her if she had had her supper, and, on finding

she had not, gave the slave a good supper from the meat her husband had

brought. The young man then said she might tell the people he had

returned, but they were not to disturb him by visiting or coming near

him that night. The Crow was delighted to be the bearer of such news,

and soon communicated the fact of the young man's arrival to all the

camp. Everybody expres.ses pleasure at the news, and they are all glad

and desirous  of seeing him and hearing  of  his  adventures                                                                but  they
                                                                                                                         ;

respect his wishes, and leave him alone with his faithful wife and child

for that night.

     The father of the youth, among the rest, had heard of his son's return,
and early next morning came in crying and snivelling. The son took no
notice of him. That day he gave a great feast, to which everybody was
invited. After they had eaten their till of the store of meat and fat he

had brought with him, he sliared with them the blankets his grand-

mother had woven and packed up for him. He cut several in two so that

all might have a share. The next day he went on to Britta'nl, and built

there a large camp. He was now made a chief, and became a great man

among them. One day, when he was out hunting with the others, the

desire came into his heart to punish Snikla'p, his father, for the deception
he had played upon him. Next day he said to his father and the others,

' I shall go out alone to hunt to-day.' They agi-eed, and he went off alone.

He presently shot a deer, and disembowelling it made a rope from the
guts. This he then transformed into a woollen rope. He now placed the
meat of the deer on his shoulders and returned towards home. When he

reached the stream that crossed his path he took half of the meat and

tied it with the rope he had made to a tree that overhung the brook.
The rest of the meat he took on with him. In the evening he informed
his father that he had left half of the deer's carcass suspended from a

tree by the brook, and that he desired him to go for it in the morning.

' All right,' said the father. Accordingly next morning Snikia'p set off

to brincr the meat home. As he left the son shouted out to him to be
              ON THE ETHNOLOGHCAL SURVEY OK CANADA.                                                                                              550

very careful of the rope the meat was tied with, as he prized it very

much, and didn't want it lost or broken. The father promised to be very

careful of it. He had no difficulty in finding the meat, which he took

down from the tree and slung across his shoulders ; but as he was cross-

ing the stream the rope broke, and the meat and rope fell into the water

together. The old man immediately jumped into the stream to secure the
rope. He did not care so much alaout the meat. ' I must not let the
rope be carried away,' said he, ' or my son will be grieved and angry.'

So saying, he caught hold of it ; but as he did so the current swept him ofi
his legs, and he was carried, rope and all, down the rushing stream to the

Thompson, and from thence into the Fraser and far down that river. He

was stopped at last by a barrier or weir, which was built across the river

near its mouth. As he approached the weir he transformed himself into a

small smooth board. Now this weir was held by four witch sisters.^ As

Snikia'p floated towards the barrier in the form of a piece of wood the

youngest of the sisters, who had gone to see if any drift wood had lodged

against the weir, observed the wood, which was about thirty inches lono',

and thought it would do well for a dish, and straightway fished it out.

She took it home with her, and the next time they cooked a salmon she
laid it on the board. As they were eating it the fish seemed to last them

a very little while, and when it had all gone they were far from beino-

satisfied. ' I haven't had enough,' said one. ' I don't seem to have eaten
Weany,' said another. '
                                                          will cook another fish,' said the third ; ' I can

eat some more myself.'                                    So  another  salmon  was    cooked                                          but  this  dis-
                                                                                                                                   ;

appeared as rapidly as the former one, and they are still feeling hungry.

Said the eldest of the sisters now, ' I think there is something wrong with

this dish. I shouldn't wonder if it isn't that Snikia'p that was drowned.'

How' That can't be,' said one of the others. '                                 could he turn into a piece

of wood ? ' Oh, he is a very powerful wizard,' said the eldest. ' Let us
throw it away anyhow,' said another ; ' throw it into the fire and burn it.'

This was done, and the seeming piece of wood began to burn. As soon

as the fire began to consume it the board began to cry like a child. This

Noaflfected the youngest sister, who wanted to save it from the fire. '

no,' said the eldest ; ' let it burn.' ' I want to save it ; it must not burn,'

declared the youngest. And she straightway took it out and washed it

and dressed its burns, which soon healed up. The piece of wood now
becomes a baby boy, who soon grows up and plays about the weir, and

observes all that the sisters do. One day, when he had grown to be a bio-

boy, the sisters all go for a walk, leaving him behind. Now they had

four boxes in the house, in which were stored the wind, the smoke, the

flies, and the wasps. These boxes had never been opened in the child's
presence, and he was curious to know what was in them, for he had been

forbidden to go near or touch them. On this occasion they Avarned him

not to touch  the boxes                                   but when  they had   gone,  his  curiosity                                       got   the

has happened, and rush home quickly, and collect the smoke and return it

to the box, scolding him the while, and telling him not to be so disobedient

again. The boy pleaded forgetfulness, and promised to let the boxes

alone for the future. The women set out again on their walk. When

this boy, who had Snikia'p's soul within him, and Snikia'p's cunning

and experience, was left alone the second time, he went out and examined

the salmon- weir. He perceives that it prevents the salmon from getting

higher up the river. The sisters presently I'eturn, and he is called away for

that time. One day they say they are going out for the morning. The

boy says he wants to go too, but they tell him they cannot be bothered

with him ; he must stay at home and look after the place. As soon as

the women have gone, Snikia'p opens one of the ' medicine ' boxes, and
the wind escapes and a gale arises. He then opens the other three boxes,

and lets their contents out also. He now j)roceeds to the centre of the

weir, and makes an opening in it through which the salmon swim up

river. The sisters soon perceive what has happened, and rush home.

They set to work to gather their scattered property, but can only secure

some of the smoke and flies. The wind gets away beyond their power to

recall, and they lose it entirely. Snikia'p now changes into an old man
again, and runs away, feeling happy and in good spirits. He has let the

salmon up the river, and the people above will be able to get them now.

--There is only one drawback to liis feelings of satisfaction the smoke and

flies are troublesome, and the wasps are very annoying. However, he

goes up river, shouting and winging, and in good time gets back to the

camp at Britta'nl. As he enters the camp he shouts to the people to

come and see the salmon he has brought up the river. He does not

I'emain there, but goes up the river shouting to the people that he has

brought the salmon. By-and-by he gets tired, and walks quietly and

slowly. He picks some green branches and carries them over his shoulders.

As he passes the villages along the river he asks the people what they
Wewould like to have. They answer, '
                                      want some of the mountain-

sheep fat that grows on the neck and smells nice.' ' Can't give you

--that,' replied Snikia'p. They then ruention another rare luxury the

back of a salmon. He declares they can have all they want of that, and
bids them go to the river, and they will And it full of salmon. He arrives

in time at Bridge River, where he makes a fall to stop the salmon from

goino- further by stepping to and fro across the river three times

But he does not make the fall high enough, and many of the salmon

jump it and get up the river. From thence he goes up the North Fraser,

"and brings the steep banks of the river together to form a cailon, so that

the people there can more easily catch the salmon. He presently crosses

the river, and passes over into the Shuswap country. At this time he is

wearing a haxidsome buckskin shirt. He wanders all round the country,
and in time gets back to Lytton. No one recognises him when he returns,

he is so altered ; and he keeps up his disguise by speaking a strange

lan"-uage and pretending ignorance of the N'tlaka'pamuQ tongue. The

people inquire among themselves who there is that is acquainted with the

other languages of the country. Some one says that Pii'iyauQ, an old

woman, knows several tongues besides her own. She is sent for to see if

she can hold converse with the stranger. She begins by speaking

Sk'quamic. Snikia'p shakes his head at this. She now tries him with

the Yale tongue. Again he shakes his head. She next tries Okanakan,

but with no better success.  Then Shuswap, then Lillooet, then Carrier

but he shakes his head at all. She knows no others, so the attempt at
communication fails. The people regai-d him as a great medicine-man

and wonder if he will heal a sick woman they have among them. They
take him to the woman. He nods his head to indicate that he under-
stands their wishes and will do as they desire. He builds a sweat-liouse
and puts the woman in it, and made to go in with her himself. Big Crow,
who has been observing all that took place, is suspicious of the man, and
when Snikia'p would have entered the sweat-house alone with the woman,

she called out to the others that he was an impostor ; that no true

medicine-man would enter the sweat-house with his patient. But the
people are angry at Big Crow ; but she declares she is right, and that he

only wants to enter the sweat-house with the woman for evil purposes.

She gets angry because they side with the stranger against her, and she

takes a club and hits Snikla'p over the head with it. He screams out at

the attack, and everybody recognises the voice of Snikla'p, and discovers

that he has been trying to trick them. They fall upon him and beat him

well. He begs for mercy, declaring that if he did wrong in the past he

has also wrought much good for them by breaking down the witches'

bari'ier across the river and letting the salmon through, and by givinc
them the cool wind which, since its escape from its prison, had blown up
river continuously. They presently allow his claim for mercy, and let

him off without further punishment. From this time the salmon came up
the river regularly, and the prevailing wind of the region is an up-current

breeze which keeps the air cool even in the hottest weather. These two

blessings the old Indians believe were due to Snikla'p the Coyote, whose
memory they keep alive by this and other stories of him and his doings.

       Matq, or the Fire Myth.

     Long, long ago the Indians on Fraser River had no knowledge of fire.

Beaver, who travelled about a good deal in the night prospectino' the

rivers, learnt from some source that away in the far north there lived a

tribe who knew how to make fire. He determined to seek out this tribe

and steal some of their fire and bring it back to the ' Stalo ' {i.e. Lower

Fraser River) Indians. He told his brother Eagle to wait for him at a

certain point on the Fraser while he went down the river to the coast to

tell the people of the settlements along its banks that he was goinff to

steal the fire for them in the far north. When he reached the coast' he
met a large tribe there. He begged from them the gift of a pair of clam-

shells in which to stow away the fire he should steal. They gave him the

shells and he then returned to his brother, and the two set out together

for the far north. ' You go through the air,' said Beaver to Eagle,* 'and

I will travel by water.' They continued their journey in this way for
many days and nights, Beaver travelling by the Fraser. "When they

arrived near the village of the people who possessed the fire, Beaver called

his brother to him and told him his plan of action. ' To-night,' said he,

' I will build a dam across the water, and then burrow from the dam along

under the ground until I come up under the house where the fire is kept!

They will spear me sooner or later, and take me to the village, but

although they will spear me they will not be able to kill me. In the

meantime I shall build myself a house in the river, and when they see it

they will come out and spear me. When they have speared me they will
take me to the house where the fire is kep"^t to skin me. I shall put the

clam shells inside my skin, and when the knife is nearly through to the
shell beneath I shall open my eye and you will see a great flash of light in

the sky. You must be close by, and when you see the flash you must fly
over the house and attract their attention. They will leave me for a
moment and run out to try and shoot you. When they are gone I shall
seize the opportunity and open my clam shell and fill it with Are. I shall

then clear away the soil from above the passage I have made from the

river to the house, rush down it, and come out in the deep water of the

river above the dam.'

Eagle approved of the plan, and promised to do his share according to

his brother's instructions. All that night Beaver worked at his dam and

the passage. By morning all was ready. When one of the women went

down to the stream to fetch her water next morning she found to her

surprise a large lake where before was only a small stream. She dropped

her pail and ran home, and told the people that a beaver was in the stream.

Everybody rushed for his spear, and all made for the stream. Some one

suggested breaking the dam and catching him in that way. This they

did ; and when the water was getting low Beaver came out of his house

and swam about as if trying to get away. He played with them for a

little while before he would permit them to spear him. Finally they

speared him and carried him with great rejoicings to the house. Every-

body now wanted his teeth, or his tail, or his claws. They presently set

about skinning him, but as the point of the knife touched the shell

hidden beneath the skin of his breast Beaver opened one eye. Now, the

boy who was holding his leg saw the action, and told the others, who only
laughed at him. Just at that moment Eagle, who had seen the signal,

came soaring over the house, making a great noise, which diverted every-

Anbody's attention from Beaver. '  eagle ! an eagle !  Shoot it !                                       !

                                                                   kill it

shouted everybody, and all ran for their bows and arrows except the boy

who was holding Beaver's leg.

This was the moment Beaver had planned for. Shaking himself free

from the boy's hold he took out his clam shells, quickly filled them with

fire, and before the boy had recovered from his astonishment plunged head
foremost down the passage hole and made for the river. The boy's cries

speedily brought the people to him, and he told them what had happened.

They now tried to dig out the hole down which Beaver had disappeared,

but they no sooner tried than the water rushed up and stopped them.

Beaver reached the stream safely, and from thence made his way to the

Eraser, v/here he was joined by his brother Eagle. As they returned

down the river Beaver threw fire on all the trees they passed, but mostly

on the Cottonwood trees, and thus it was that the wood from these trees

was the best for making fire with from that time onward. He continued

to do this till he had reached the coast again, and all his fire was gone. After

this he assumed a human form and taught the Indians how to make fire

by means of the drill worked between the hands. He also taught them
how to preserve the fire when once secured in the following manner. He

procured a quantity of the inner bark of the cedar tree and made it into a

long rope. This he then covered with the bark of some other trees which

burnt less readily. When one end of this rope was lighted it would con-

tinue to smoulder for several days, according to the length of the rope.

When the Indians were travelling and likely to be away from camp several

days they always carried one of these fire-ropes, called by themselves

Patla'kan, coiled round their shoulders.
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  563

     After this great gift to them the Indians thought ^e^y highly of

Beaver, and he was usually called by them ' our head brother ' because of
his wisdom and goodness.

                                                Painted Blanlat Myth.

     When Beaver had finished his instructions to the ' Stalo ' Indians he

 returned to the Thompson River, and hearing there that a young medicine-

 man possessed a remarkable figured blanket which his father, a very oreat

 and wise Shaman, had made for him, he determined to secure this treasure

 for himself. Accordingly he and all the people of his village started oflT

 to find the young Shaman's dwelling. After travelling a great way they

 finally discovered his home, and having told him the object of their journey
 was to see his wonderful blanket, begged to be allowed to look at it. But
 this the young Shaman was unwilling to do, knowing they would take it
 from him if they once saw it. Disappointed by his refusal to show it
 some of them determined to kill him, and afterwards steal and make off
 with the blanket. Their designs were revealed to him in a dream by his

guardian spirit, and he resolved to outwit and punish them for their evil

intentions. Leaving his house he went and camped on the edge of a steep

precipice, taking with him the bladders of several animals he had lately

killed, and which he seems to have kept for the purpose. He also took
with him his snow-shoes. He wetted the bladders and blew them out and
secured their mouths. He had not been settled long when several of the

men came over to him with the intention of murdering him and then

securing his magic blanket for themselves. But he, knowing their irten-
tions, was prepared for them. Taking his snow-shoes and the bladders of
wind, he placed them under his blanket in such a manner as to make them

appear like a dog at his side. He sat with his face towards the precipice,

between him and which there was but a narrow strip of ground. In the

dusk the edge of the precipice was not discernible. As the men
approached he cried out to them not to come too close to him, as his doo'
was very savage and fierce. They therefore went and sat down some little
way from him, just on the edge of the precipice with their backs towards
it, and their faces towards him. As they seated themselves the younc
Shaman shifted his seat so that he sat upon one of the bladders, from
which he now permitted the wind to escape in sudden jerks and gusts,
which made a noise like the angry growlings of a fierce dog. The men grew
alarmed ; the more so as he now pushed forward the toes of his snow-shoes,
which to them seemed the dog's fore-paws. At the same time the youth

cried out, ' Take care now, take care ! You have made my dog angry and

dangerous,' and at the same moment he pushed the snow-shoes farther
towards them. In their fear of the dog they moved back a little, and the
young Shaman moved witn them as if he were trying to restrain the dog.

Opening a second bladder, and pushing the snow-shoes again towards
them, the two things together caused them to retreat still farther until,
all unknown to themselves, they sat upon the very brink of the preci-

pice. He now opened the third bladder, which made a horrible noise as

the wind escaped, and at the same time pushed forward the snow-shoes

again. Thinking to avoid the supposed dog they all moved backward, and
before they had realised their danger were over the brink and falling
headlong down the precipice, at the bottom of which they were dashed to
pieces. Thus did the young Shaman outwit his would-be murderers and

robbers. He now determined to run away and hide himself from the

                                                                                          02

annoying curiosity of the rest of the tribe ; but before he had gone far
Beaver found his trail, and led the people after him. They overtook him

at nightfall, whereupon he climbed a high tree. 'Well,' said Beaver, 'he
cannot get away from us now. Let us camp round the tree, then when he

descends in the morning we will ask him again to show us his wonderful

blanket.'

     They made their camp at the foot of the tree, and felt sure he could
not get away without their knowledge. But before the night was half
over the young Shaman called his magic powers into play and caused them
all to fall into a deep sleep. Beaver, who was watching, felt the sleep

stealing upon his senses, and resisted the spell for a long time ; but the

Shaman was too powerful for him, and he, like the rest, at length fell into
profound slumber. As soon as Beaver and his party were asleep, the
young Shaman descended from the tree and continued his flight. It was
late the next day before they all awoke from their magic sleep, and they
were scarcely surprised to find that the young man had gone. But Beaver
had no iatention of being beaten in this way, and encouraged them to
take up the trail and follow him again. They travelled fast, and overtook
him just about nightfall. Again he hid himself in a high tree, and again
they encamped at its foot, determined not to give way to sleep this time.

But one by one they all dropped off" to sleep, again being wholly unable to
resist the Shaman's power, with the exception of Beaver. This time he
was proof against the spell of the Shaman, who presently began to
descend the tree. As he reached the ground he saw that Beaver was
wide awake and watching him. From this he perceived that he must

give way, as the medicine of Beaver was stronger than his own. He

therefore presented Beaver with the wonderful blanket, and went his way.
Beaver now carefully examined the blanket, and found it to be covered

with pictures of all kinds of utensils and weapons. These pictures repre-
sented the originals of all the articles used by the Indians, with the
exception of the fish spears which had been given to the Thompson Indians

by their culture hero. Benign Face.
    Beaver now cut the blanket up into pieces according to the patterns

of the paintings upon it, so that each piece represented in outline the

form of some tool, or utensil, or weapon. From these patterns, under the
instruction of Beaver, the people are said to have made everything they
had in use in the way of weapons or tools when the whites first came in
contact with them. Throughout this adventure Beaver had worn a human
form, but after he had taught the Indians how to make useful things for
themselves from the patterns on the magic blanket, the young Shaman

transformed him into an animal, under which guise he is .still recognised
by the wise Indians. Thus did the Shaman revenge himself upon his
adversary. But this act did not satisfy him for the loss of his blanket

and  power                                 he  would  revenge  himself  also  upon  the  people  for  who.se
                                        ;

sake Beaver had won the blanket from liira. Up to this time they had

not returned home, but when Beaver was transformed into an animal

they began to think of doing so.

                                  Koahoela, or Husband root Myth.

     They had, however, no sooner started than the young Shaman caused
them to become bewildered and lose their way and each other. They wan-
dered about looking for the path and each other for days, and though they
all got back eventually) with the exception of one woman, they suffered many
           ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEV OF CANADA,  565

hardships by the way. This one woman could not tind her way back, and

had to build a shelter in the woods and support herself upon i-oots and

berries as best she might. After she had lived some while in this lonely

state, as she could not get a man for a husband, she determined to take
for husband a certain kind of root. This root now goes by the name

Koakoeht, or ' Husband-root.' By this root-husband she became the mother

of a male child. When the child had grown into a sti'ong youth he one

day asked his mother where his father was. The woman was ashamed to

tell him what kind of a father he had had ; she dissembled thei-efore, and

told him that his father had been drowned. On hearing this the youth

went to the river and reproached it for drowning his parent. The river

denied the charge, declaring that his father had not been drowned. Upon

hearing this he returned to his mother, and said, ' Mother, you have

deceived me ; my father was not drowned. Why don't you tell me truly

where  my  father  is  1       The mother still prevaricated, and said, ' Your
                            '

father is dead, my son ; it is true he was not drowned ; he fell from a

lofty tree and was killed as he was trying to take a hawk's nest.' The

boy, to whom the language of all nature was familiar, now I'eproached the
trees for the death of his father ; but they one and all denied it. He

returned again a second time to his mother, and entreated her to tell him

the truth concerning his father, and where he was. The request was too

embarrassing for his mother to comply with, so she put him off again by

declaring that his father had fallen over a precipice and broken his neck.

But when the youth taxed the precipice with the deed it indignantly

denied the charge. As he was returning home he found his feet catching

in a certain kind of root, which constantly tripped him up. As this had

never happened to him before, he wondered what it meant. When he got

home he said to his mother, ' Mother, I see you do not intend to satisfy

my longing to know who and where my father is you have deceived me
                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

these three times. I shall not ask you again ; but, tell me, why does this

root trip me up all the time to-day when I walk in the woods 1 ' and he

held a root in his hand similar to that which his mother had taken for

husband. The mother turned away and would not answer him, though

she perceived that the knowledge he sought would soon be made known to

him. He now determined to prepare himself to become a Shaman. He

therefore left his mother and lived apart by himself, and fasted and exercised

his body till a Shaman's dream came to him, and with it great Shamanistic

power. In his dream he learnt also that he was the son of a root. This

knowledge made clear to him at once why bis mother had sought to

deceive him about his father. He now determined tt) seek out the tribe

to which his mother belonged. In the course of his journey he came one

day upon a great concourse of people watching a game of ball. They

asked no questions of him as he joined the players ; but when he presently

struck one of his opponents' legs they got angry and mocked him, calling

him the ' son of a root,' and from this time forward he was known by the

name Koakoe'la.' He was so struck with shame at this taunt that he

covered his face with his hands. Some of the people are sorry for him,

and try to cheer him Up. But he cannot endure the thought of having

his birth thrown in his teeth every time any little disagreement occurs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

so he goes away by himself again and undergoes a longer fast and training

than before. In course of time he becomes a very great and powerful

Shaman whom everybody fears and respects, and no one again ventures to

remind him of his ' Koakoe'la ' descent. Some time after this he meets

the liei'o SyuC''qtkoatlt ^ and his two brothers. Each endeavours to test the

other's powers but finding they are equally strong and invincible, they
                                                                                 ;

desist from their efforts and become great friends. The Shaman youth, to

show his powers, made with his linger three small holes in the rock, and

caused them to become instantly filled with a savoury soup. He then

gave SQoe'qtkoatlt's two brothers a spoon each, and told them to eat the

soup. ' That is soon done,' said one of them ; ' it is but a spoonful.' ' Well,

try now,' said Koakoe'la, ' and see if you can eat it in a spoonful.'

Laughing, they both dipped their spoons in and emptied the holes at once,

but before they had swallowed the soup the holes were full again. And

this continued till each had taken as much as he could eat, yet the holes

remained full. Sqoe'qtkoatlt, who understood the trick, looked on and

smiled. When they could eat no more the Shaman laughed at them, and

bade them continue and persevere, and perhaps they would exhaust his

supply. They said they could eat no more. ' Oh yes, you can,' said the

Shaman ; and taking them in his arms, he shook them so well that on
being placed on their feet again they found they could eat some more. So

they attacked the holes of soup again ; but eat as much or as fast as they

would the holes always remained full. They presently confessed them-

selves beaten, and gave up the contest.  Ah'  !      said the Shaman,  ' you don't
                                                  '

know how to do it. It is quite simple. Watch me.' And dipping the

spoon in each hole, he emptied them in a moment. What happens to the

Shaman after this my informant was unable to relate, and the story came

to an abrupt ending here.

This meeting of Koakoe'la and EnpatcT'tcIt, or the three Bear brothers,

is said to liave taken place at the Indian village of Nikai'ah, on the

Eraser, a little below the junction of this river with the Thompson ; and

the little holes said to liave been made by him, as related above, are

pointed out in the rock by the Indians to this day.

Side. As the house was in darkness she could not tell who he was, and

presently he stole away on her scolding him for his intrusion. When he

left her .side she watched the smoke-hole to see if he left the house, but
seeing no shadow against the sky she came to the conclusion that he was

an inmate of the house. As there were several families in the same
keekwilee- house, it never entered her mind to suspect that the intruder
was her own brother. After a few weeks had elapsed the maiden found
herself with child. She was greatly distressed when she discovered her
condition, the more so as she knew not the man who had brought this
trouble and disgrace upon her. The least she could do before she told her

parents of her condition was to discover his name. Suspecting that he

would sooner or later pay her a second visit, she resolved to lay a trap to

discover his identity. She thereupon begged from her mother some paint

of two colours, black and red. ' What do you want with paint ? ' said the

mother ; ' you cannot paint yourself.' ' I don't wish to paint myself,' replied

the gii-1. ' I need it for some other purpose,' and she teased and worried
her mother till she gave her what she wanted. Before retiring that night
she took some grease and mixed it with the paint, after which she covered

the insides of both of her hands with the mixture, red on one and black
on the other. Thus she awaited the next visit of her betrayer. One
night he stole again to her couch and lay with her again as she slept.
She awoke earlier this time, and before he left her she endeavoured to
make him speak to her, so that she might discover his identity by the
sound of his voice ; but this he would not do. Finding he would not
thus betray himself, as he sought to leave her she made pretence to
detain him by putting her arms about him. While she held him thus for
a moment she impressed the palms of her paint-smeai-ed hands firmly upon

his shoulders and left a clear imprint of them there in red and black. He

now left her, all unconscious of the tell-tale marks she had placed upon
him. ' In the morning,' said she to herself, ' I shall know him by the

pattern on his shoulders.'

    Now it was customary for Loon to call all the young men of his

household early in the morning to go out to swim, and exercise themselves
in various kinds of sports. After the youths had taken their swim in the
river they would paint themselves in fanciful designs, and then contend

together in racing and other exercises. On this particular morning the

girl begged so hai'd to be allowed to go out for once and see the
games that at last her mother consented. She bade her daughter put
on her best robes. This the girl did, and clothed herself in a beautiful
soft elk-hide dress, which was covered throughout with handsome bead-

work. On presenting herself to the neighbours she was regarded with
much astonishment by all, but she took no notice of any of them, her
whole attention being given to scanning the backs of the young men

before her. She passed them one by one in silent review before her, but
could discover on the shoulders of none of them the imprint of a pair
of human hands in red and black. She was puzzled, as she knew very well
that the paint could not be washed off in the water. She never thought
to look at her brother until presently he ran close by her and exposed his
shoulders to her gaze. In a moment her eye caught the impression of
her hands in the red and black paint upon his back.

    At first she would not believe her sight, but when she could doubt no

longer she gave a shriek of pain, and putting her hands to her face cried
aloud and rocked herself in her distress and grief. The bystanders

thought the brother had accidentally struck her in the face as he Was pass-

ing, and chided him for his carelessness ; but she said nothing, only sat
rocking herself and sobbing. Presently she got up and returned to the

house. All that day she cried and wept for the shame her brother

had brought upon her and her parents. That same night her brother

stole again to her couch. She was awake on this occasion, and repulsed

him, telling him she knew who he was, and upbraided him for his selfish-

ness and the wrong he had done her. ' How do you know I am your

brother ? ' said he. ' Your voice would tell me now if I did not know

before,' replied she ; ' but I discovered who you were this morning.' She

then told him what she had done on his last visit to her, and how she

discovered him that morning, and also the condition she was in. * How
could you bring this shame upon our father ? ' she continued. ' When the

people know they will point the finger of scorn at him, and he will be

dishonoured among them ; it will kill him with shame. There is but one

Wething for us now to do.  must go away somewhere by ourselves and

never come back again, so that none may know the disgrace you have

brought upon us. Let us go away now at once before it is light and the

people are stirring.' To this the brother presently assented, and they

stole away in the daik together.

As the girl left her father's keekwilee-house she pulled off strips

of the bead-work of her dress, and as she went she hung bits of it on the

branches of the trees or on projecting points of rock every ten steps she

took. This she continued to do until she had stripped and hung up all

the bead-work on her robe. They had been journeying ten days before

this happened through the pathless forest. AVhen she had hung the last

Webit she stopped and said to her brother : '  will stay here, we have gone

far enough now.' So they stopped there, and he built a house for them.

After a few months had passed the girl gave birth to a child, a tine,

healthy boy, who speedily grew up to be a strong youth. One day he

ran crying to his mother, asking her why he had no grandmother or

grandfather. The poor mother's heart bled at the child's question, as she

the lad had grown to be a sturdy youth the mother told the brother it

was time for them to make the final preparations. They had often

talked together in their loneliness, as the child was growing up, as to the

course they would pursue when he had grown to be a big boy, and he

now took his weapons and went out to hunt. This he continued to do

day after day until he had brought home enough skins of the mountain

sheep and goat for her to weave twelve large blankets from their wool,

and also lay by a nice store of dried meat and kidney-fat. When their

tasks were completed the mother called the lad to her and told him that

she had deceived him when she had said he had no other relatives but

herself and his father. ' Ten days' journey from here,' said she, ' lies the

myvillage of  father and his tribe.  You are now big enough to make the

journey thither alone, and we propose to send you to see your grand-

parents.' ' But why don't you come too 1 ' questioned the boy. The

mother found it difficult to satisfy him on this point, but he presently

consented to make the journey alone and come back and bring them

later. ' But bow shall I find the way 1 ' said he. ' That will not be

ditficult,' replied the mother ; and taking him to the edge of the forest she
showed him a bit of bead-work hanging from the lower branch of a tree.

' You see this bead-work 1 ' said she. ' Well, every ten paces on your way

you will find another piece. If you look out for- these and follow the

course they mark, in ten days you will come to your grandfather's village.'

' But how shall I know my grandparents when I get there ? ' queried the

youth. The mother answered : ' You have an uncle who has but one eye
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

when you tind him all will be well.' She then instructed him in many

--things which only medicine-men know how to make himself invisible,

and many other things. In the meantime his father had been busy

coming on. Why do you want so much wood now 1 ' The mother

answeied, 'Your father and I have a use for it, my son ; we have a great

task to perform when you have gone.' The boy was curious to know

what this was, but his mother would say no more. Everything being

ready, the time now came for the boy to start. His mother made a pile

of the blankets she had woven, in which she wrapped a large supply of

their dried meat and fat, and told her son he was to take the blankets and

meat to his grandparents as a present. The youth put the bundle on his

shoulders, and though it was bulky and heavy he found no inconvenience

from it, as his mother had uttered ' medicine ' words over it, which made

it light and easy to carry. He now bade them good-bye and set out on

his long journey. His parents watched him go, and shed many tears as he

passed into the forest out of their sight. Then taking each other by the

hand they went back towards the house. ' Come, brother, our work is

nearly finished ; let us complete it,' said the woman. When they entered

the house they lit a fire at the base of the pile of pine-logs, and, climbing

upon the top together, they lay down side by side, hand in hand. In a

few moments the flames from the pitch enveloped them, and in a short

while the pile was consumed, and they with it.

Thus had they planned to wipe out the disgrace which had darkened

their lives.

     In the meantime the son of the unhappy pair had been making his
way through the forest as his mother had directed him ; when, coming
to an eminence and disregarding his mother's injunctions not to look

back after he had once started, he cast his eyes in the direction of his

home, and was startled and shocked to see flames and smoke coming from

the roof of the house. Casting down his bundle without a moment's

consideration, he ran back upon his trail as fast as his legs could carry

him                    but  he  only arrived  in  time to see the roof  fall in.  The heat was
                    ;

too great for him to go near the ruins ; he could only watch the flames

consume the last timbers of his home. He wondered what had become

of his parents, and feared they had been destroyed in the fire. Presently

he groped his way among the charred remains, and saw enough to con-

vince him that his parents had perished. He could not understand it all,

and snt crying all that day and the following night. During the night

he had a dream which revealed to him many things. He learnt why his

parents had left their home, and the punishment they had planned for

themselves, and that they had deliberately burnt themselves to death in

expiation of his father's offence. Very sad at heart he turned his back
next morning upon the ashes of his parents and old home, and once more

set out on his journey. Finding his pack, he continued his way through

the forest, following the guiding strips of bead-work, until at last he

arrived at the village of his grandfather. He now recalled what his

mother had told him about his one-eyed uncle, and looked about for such

a person. lie saw presently a little old man before him, aild as h&

approached him he deemed it wise to make himself invisible for the time.

He now saw that the little old fellow was shooting on the ground with
his arrows. He saw too that he had but one eye, and wishing to test

whether he Avas his uncle or not he placed his foot on the spot at which

the little man was shooting, and caught one of his arrows between his

tirst and second toes. When the little fellow went to get his arrows he

could not draw this one away, as the youth held it tight between his toes.

He now spoke to the little man, who was much frightened at the sound

of a voice so near him when he could see no one. The youth told him

not to fear                                                             that  it was  his  ' medicine '  that  prevented  him from  seeing
                                                                     ;

who he was. Making inquiries he soon discovered that his grandparents

were still alive, and that the little man before him was his uncle. When

he told him that he was his nephew he would not believe it. To prove

to the uncle that what he said was true, he asked him if he could re-

member how his lost sister used to speak. Oh' yes,' said he ; ' I can
remember quite well.' ' Was it like thisl' said the youth, and he imitated

his mother's voice. ' Yes, yes ! ' said the uncle, ' that is her voice.'

' Now look at me,' said the nephew, 'and tell me if I am like your sister
or brother.' And as he spoke he made passes in the air with his left hand,

and became immediately visible to his uncle, who knew him at once to be

really his nephew from his likeness to his lost brother and sister. The

lad then told the little man the story of his mother's and father's life, and

the reason of their mysterious departure from the village, and bade him

go to tell his grandmother privately that he had come. ' But she will not

believe me,' said the uncle, ' and will be angry with me for trying to fool
her.' 'Stay, then,' said the youth; 'I will give you some proofs of my

presence to show her, and then she will not doubt you. Tell me, what is

Vthe matter with your eye                                                                  'I am blind in it ; I was born so,' replied

the little uncle. ' Well,' answered the youth, ' I will give you sight in it

with my " power," and you can then show it to my grandmother if she

doubts your word.' With that the nephew passed his hand over his

uncle's eye four times, and the latter's blind eye was made whole, and he

saw with it for the first time in his life. Full of wonder and admiration

for his nephew's power, he ran off to tell his mother. When he first

whispered the tidings in Jier ear she was angry with him for attempting

to fool her, as she thought, but when he showed her his blind eye restored

she could no longer disbelieve him. Immediately she ran out to find her

daughter's son, and was much delighted to find so comely a youth claiming

her as his grandmother. When she questioned him concerning his parents

he repeated to her the story of their lives as he had told his uncle, and aa

it had been revealed to hira after their death. The old woman wept ' as
she listened to the tragic end of her children. When the grandfather

was made aware of his grandson's arrival, and had also heard the account

of his lost children's death, he called all the village together and informed

them of the youth's arrival and the events which led to his parents'

voluntary death. Meantime the old lady bade the girls clean up the

house and strew clean fir bi-anches on the floor in honour of her grandson's

coming. When he entered the house he undid his pack and presented

his grandmother with his jDarents' presents. The old woman spread out

the twelve beautiful blankets, and set the meat and fat ready at hand for
the feast which the chief now proclaimed. The whole village now came
together to see the youth and the presents he had brought his grand-
parents. During the feast the story of his mother's and father's life was

retold again, and tlieir sad end drew tears from all the women present.
At the close of the feast the grandmother told her neighbours that they

would see her grandson no more, as she intended to keep him secluded as
she had his mother; which thing she did, and the lad never left the
keekwilee-house except at night when all the village was asleep, or early

in the morning before they had arisen.

    Now it had happened that when the people had been invited to the

feast two old witch-women had been overlooked, as their dwelling was
somewhat apart from the others ; and when they heard later of the occur-
rence they were angry, the more particularly as they were very curious
to see the boy. They determined to be revenged for the slight, and to

see the youth at the same time whose advent had been a nine days'

wonder in the village. So one day they took some human ordui-e, and
mixing it with earth fashioned it in the form of birds. By their witch-

power they then transformed these clay effigies into real live birds of

beautiful and attractive plumage. They had not long completed their

task when the little uncle chanced to come that way, and seeing the
pretty strange birds he much desired to secure them for himself. Having

his bow and arrows with him he tried to shoot them. He struck them

again and again, but could not kill them. The most that he did was to
knock a few feathers out of them. 'Ah!' said he to himself, 'I wish

my nephew were her^ ; he would be able to kill them all right.' And so

saying he gathered up the brilliant feathers to take home to show him
and his mother. Calling his mother's attention to the beauty of the
feathers, and telling her of his ill success with his shooting, he begged her

to let his nephew come out for a little while to shoot the birds for him.
The old mother would not at first hear of it, but on the nephew himself

expressing an eai'nest wish to go out with his uncle to secure the birds,
she presently gave way, and permitted the two to go off together. The

youth easily shot and killed the birds. To carry them home he put them
inside the breast of his shirt next his skin. While the shooting had been

going on the two spiteful old witch-women had taken a good look at him,

and so won their desire.

     As they were returning home the youth complained of an unpleasant
odour. ' What is this nasty smell ? ' said he. 'Where can it come from ?
Have you not stepped on something nasty, uncle 1 ' But as he spoke he

felt something wet and cold against his skin under his shirt. Pulling

open his shirt, he saw inside, where a few moments before he had placed

the beautiful birds, now neither birds nor feathers, but the nasty material
from which they had been made by the witches. Perceiving he had been

tricked, and horribly disgusted, he cast his garments aside and plunged

into the river to cleanse himself, bidding his uncle at the same time fetcli

him some clean garments. After he had washed himself and put on clean

clothes, he felt so mortified and ashamed that he determined to leave the

spot and go and live by himself in the woods. He informed his uncle of

     ' This curious habit of seclusion seems from the stories to have been quite a

common custom. Instances occur again and again, particularly in the families of

chiefs

his intention, and invited him to accompany him. The little man, who

had grown very fond of his nephew, was only too delighted to go with

him, and so they set out together. They lived alone in the forest for

several years, till the youth had come to mature manhood, when a restless

spirit came over him. At last he said to his uncle, ' I am going to look

for a wife for myself. I know of two beautiful women in Cloudland. I

shall go and get them for wives.' He thereupon shot a large mountain

eagle, and carefully skinning it, he dried and prepared the skin, leaving

the feathers and wings on. When he had tinished it he put it on himself

and attempted to fly. As he mounted into the air his uncle cried out to

him not to fly away and leave him all alone. ' Don't be afraid, little uncle,'

answered he ; 'I am not going away yet. I am only practising.' When

he had practised enough he returned to his uncle again, who begged him

not to fly off" and leave him. ' Very well,' answered the young man, ' I

can take you with me, but only on one condition. You must promise to

keep your eyes shut tight all the time we are in the air.' If you open

them we shall fall to the ground.' The uncle readily gave the promise.

The nephew then took him in his arms and soared aloft with him. They

had not, however, gone far when the uncle felt a great curiosity to see

what it looked like down on the earth, and forgetting his promise opened

his eyes. Immediately they descended rapidly to the ground. O'

uncle,  you  broke  your  promise,  I  know,'  said  the  nephew                                 'you  must  have
                                                                                              ;

opened your eyes. Now if you do that we can never get up.' The little

man was very sorry, and promised not to open his eyes again. They

started a second time, but they had not got very far up before the desire

to open his eyes was too strong for the uncle to resist. As soon as he

opened them they returned to the ground as before. The nephew, finding

he could not trust his uncle, told him he must leave him behind. ' But,'

said he, ' I -will change you into whatever animal or bird you would like

to be while I am away.' The little man thought for a moment, and then

said he would prefer to be a little duck and sport in the lake. The nephew

thereupon turned him into a little red-eyed duck. 'When will you return

to me, nephew 1 ' asked the uncle. ' When you see the clouds in the sky

get very red you will know I am coming. That shall be my sign,' replied

the nephew. Having thus disposed of his uncle he now flew off". The

little duck watched him till he could see him no longer, and then began

to disport himself after the manner of his kind in the water. Meanwhile

the nephew flew into the clouds, and after some little time came to a

small island there. Alighting on a tree, he stood for a moment to survey
the prospect. At no great distance from him he perceived a house out of

which a beautiful young woman was now coming. He watched her as

she made her way to a lake at the foot of the tree on which he was
resting. On nearing the lake the maiden cast aside the beautiful robe

she was wearing, and which resembled the dress of a magpie, and stood

naked, all unconscious that a man's gaze was upon her. She approached

the lake and was about to plunge in for a swim when she caught sight of

the reflection in the water below her of the eagle in the tree above her

head. In a moment she was overcome with shame, and knew that the

seeming eagle was really a man in disguise who had looked unhindered

upon her nakedness. Immediately she drew her long hair about her and

crouched down iii confusion on the edge of the liank. The youth looked

on, but uttered no word. Presently the maid cast her eyes upward

towards him, and addressed liim in these words : ' I know that you are

not a bird, but a man disguised as one. You have looked upon me in my

nakedness and brought shame upon me.^ I must now become your wife.

But I have a   sister                    you  must   sec  her  too,'  and                 with   that  she                                spranw
                                      ;

towards her dress, drew it hastily about her, and rushed home. On

arriving there she threw herself on her bed, sobbing and crying, and

would make no reply to her sister when she sought to learn the cause of

her trouble and grief. Finding it vain to attempt to get an answer to

her queries, she took the water-bucket in her hand and went off to the

lake to get some water, and to see if she could discover why her sister

had returned so quickly, and what had caused her trouble. She was

robed as a kingtisher is robed, and on getting near the lake she also threw

otf her dress and made to plunge into tlie water to bathe, but was likewise

arrested in the act of doing so by the image of the eagle in the water

beneath her. But, unlike her sister, she was not overcome with shame

at being caught naked.- She addressed the disguised young man thus :
' Oh, now I see what is the matter with my young sister. Well, she must

be your wife   now                    but  not  she  only,  you     must                  also  marry  me.                                   Come
                                   ;

down from the tree and cast aside your disguise.' The young man de-

scended from the tree, cast off his eagle-skin, and hung it upon a branch

close by. Meanwhile, the woman had put her robe on again and filled

her pail with water. Together they walked to the sisters' house, and he

became husband to them both. He lived thus with them for some time,

and each of his wives gave birth to a son. They were now five in all',

Weand one day the young man said to his two wives, '                                             are getting too

many for this small place ; let us return to Earth again and go back to
my old grandfather, the Loon.' The wives consenting, he once more

donned his eagle-skin, and taking a wife under each arm, and a child tied

to each of his legs, he descended thus from the Cloud Island.

While he had been absent the little duck uncle had each day watched

for signs of his nephew's return. One day he was gladdened by seein<^

ma,ny red clouds in the sky. my'Now,' said he to himself, ' I shall see
nephew once more.' He kept his little red eyes on the clouds, and

presently saw his nephew approaching the spot where he was. In a few
moments more he alighted, and presented his wives to his uncle. ' Now,'

said he, ' will you come home with us ?' But the little uncle felt a paiu

at his heart, for he had perceived that his nephew's affections were no

longer his own as in the former days. He now had children and wives to

love and care   for.                   So tlie little man      answered,                  ' No,  nephew                                   I  will

children now.' ' Very well,' replied the nephew, ' do just as you like.'

So the uncle remained on the lake as a duck, and became the progenitor
of all the little red-eyed ducks now in the country.

    Biddinw the uncle good-bye, the young man took his wives and
children, and directed his way to his grandfather's A-illage. When they

arrived there was great rejoicing once more. The old Loon and his wife
were still alive, and encouraged their grandson to settle down with them.
This he did, and his descendants in course of time became a great and

powerful tribe.

Snii'i/a c^pltakoEtl, or Beaver Story.

A long time ago Beaver lived all alone in his keekwilee-house just

below the village of Spuzzum. He had two sisters, the Mouse and the

Bush-rat. They lived together at Swimp, and the Frog lived with them.

Both sisters had several children. One day Snii'ya got out his canoe

and crossed the river to Spuzzum late in the evening. He went on
to Swimp and visited the house of his sisters. When Snii'ya saw the

Froc, whose arms from the elbows to the wrists were adorned with

bracelets, he admired her much. She came and sat down by the fire,

holdinw herself so that her bracelets might be easily seen. Snii'ya

Hepresently tells his sisters that he would like the Frog for his wife.

sat at the fire till it had burnt itself out and all was in darkness.

The others had all retired earlier. When it is dark Snii'ya crawls ovtr

to the Frog's sleeping-place and pulls her blanket. ' What do you want %

Who are you 1 ' said the Frog. Snii'ya says nothing, but pulls the
Fro<^'s foot. The Frog cries cut again, ' Who are you, and what do you

want 1 ' Snii'ya now reveals himself, and the Frog says again, ' What do
you want ? ' 'I want you to become my wife,' said he. The only

answer the Frog gave was to lift her foot and kick Snii'ya in the face.

He does not mind this in the least ; he simply falls on his back and

laughs. He pulls her by the foot a second time, and she kicks him away

a<^ain. Again Snii'ya laughs and tells her he does not mind her kicking,

and intends to make her his wife. The Frog now remarks that she does not

desire him for her husband. ' You aie not the kind of man I want,' said

she. ' Do you think I like a round, big-bellied, big-headed creature like

you for husband 1 ' Snu'ya only laughs at this. This makes the Frog

angry, and she begins to revile him in bitter language. Still Snu'ya

does not mind. But presently, finding he can make no impression upon

her, he gave up his efforts and left her, and went over to his sister the

Mouse, and told her to take her children and go with them to the hill

near by. ' There is a cave there,' said he ; 'it will hold you all nicely.'

He then goes to his other sister, the Bush-rat, and bids her do the same.
The Mouse sister now wishes to know why she should go in the night.

' Would not the morning do ? ' said she. Snii'ya tells her that the Frog

has shamed and scorned and insalted him. Bush-i at then asks what he

is foing to do when they are gone.  Oh' !                           said he,  I'  am  going to have
                                                                 '

some fun all to myself, and I don't want you to be present.' This is all

they can get from him. However, they both get up, roll up their blankets

and mats, and leave him alone with the Frog- woman. The Frog has not

spoken a word while this conversation was going on. As soon as his

sisters and their families have gone Snii'ya begins to dance and

whistle. When he whistles the Frog gets very angry, calling him many

objectionable names, and biddiiig him go and leave her to. sleep in

peace. Snu'ya pays no attention whatever to her, but continues to

whistle and dance more vigorously than ever. It was a rain- song that he

was whistling called tlazmlic'qtcin} 'tlaz-pe-e-e-e-e-e-e-e'-iiq-tcin,' 'tlaz-pe-

e-e-e-e-e-e-e'-uq-tcin,' tlaz-pe-e-e-e-e-e-e-e'-iiq-tcin,' sang Snu'ya, and pi-e-

sently the rain began to fall gently. But as the song continued and Snii'ya

danced faster and faster it fell harder and harder until it descended in

sheets, no such rain ever having been seen before. In a short time the

creek near the house began to rise and roll the rock about with a

thunderous noise. Soon the water overflows and spreads itself every-

where. It enters the keekwilee-house, and soon Snu'ya is swimming

about and beating time to his song with his tail on the water. The

Fi'og's bed begins to get wet : she gets up and raises it higher. In a little

Awhile the water is up to it again.                                                                 second time she raises it. But now

Snu'ya knocks a hole in the wall with his tail, and the flood pours in upon

them. Snii'ya now swims home across the river. The day now begins to

break. He gets into his canoe and paddles merrily away, still whistling

the Rain Song. In the meantime the Frog is floating about on her bed-

board, and is carried to the mouth of the creek, calling aloud for help.

She presently perceives Snu'ya paddling by in his canoe, and calls out to

him to come and save her, telling him she will take him for husband.

To all her entreaties Snu'ya replies, ' What do you want ? ' and whistles

away. The Frog implores him to bring his canoe over and save her.

' Ob, come and take me into your canoe and I will be your wife,' cried

she. Snu'ya answers back, ' Use your own stomach for a boat. I'll not

trouble myself about you.' The Frog still continues to beseech him to

deliver her, calling him by all the endearing terms she can utter. The

eddies whirl her about and greatly alarm her. Snu'ya now begins to

mock her. ' Oh, you could not be my wife. You surely could not marry

a round-headed, big-bellied, short-legged, flat-tailed creature like me,'

said he, repeating the ill names she had so disdainfully called him by a

little time before. The current soon carries her past him out into the

great Fraser, down which she floats till she comes to a spot about four or

five miles above Yale called Nu'ksakoum. Thus did Snu'ya revenge

himself upon the disdainful Frog for refusing to accept him as her

husband.

                         Story of Snikid'p, Qai'non, Tzala's, and Spatc-

     Once upon a time Snikla'p, Qai'non, Tzala's, and Spate lived in the
same locality, each in his own keekwilee-house. Snikla'p being one day
without any food in his house, bethought him that it would be a good

time to pay a neighbourly visit to the house of Qai'non. On reaching
Qai'non's keekwilee-house he looked down the smoke-hole and accosted

him. Qai non replied in a friendly manner, and bade his visitor come in.
Snikla'p clambered down. Said he, as he took a seat near the fire, ' I
was feeling very lonesome this morning, and thought I should like to

come over and have a neighbourly chat with you.' ' I am truly delighted

it into a ' p.' This is an interesting instance of the interchange of these two letters

to see you,' responded Qai'non ; ' I am always glad to see a friend drop in

for a chat. Snikla'p now began to look about him, and perceived that the

house was well stocked with lots of dried deer-flesh. Presently, after

they had chatted awhile, Qai'non said, ' You must have some dinner

before you go away.' Looking towards his stores of dried meat, he said,

' I can't offer you this dried stuff ; I should like you to have some fresh

meat. Just stay a moment, and let me run out to my deer-trap and see

if there is anything in it. I ought to find a deer there.' And with that

Qai'non hastened to go to the trap. Snikla'p, as soon as he had gone out,

climbed up the notched pole and observed with much curiosity and

interest Qai'non go towards his deer-trap, which was not far from the

house. He saw him pause there a moment to inspect the trap, which

held no deer, and then pass on to the wood beyond. Presently a big

buck sprang up in Qai'non's path. The deer took no notice of Qai'non,

who now began to revile it in insulting language. At first the buck paid

no attention to the remarks of Qai'non, but presently his language became

so bad that he grew angry and ran at Qai'non to punish him. This was

just what Qai'non wanted, and as the angry deer approached him he

turned and ran towards the snare, keeping just a few feet in front of his

pursuer. When he was close to the trap he opened his wings and shot

through the opening in a twinkling. The deer, not perceiving the snare,

blindly followed, and was caught by the noose, and thus fell a victim to

Qai'non's cunning. Qai'non now took his knife and cut the deer's throat

to bleed him. He then quickly skinned him, cut off a large piece of the

Ahmeat, and returned to the house with it. '  !                                                                                                         said  Snikla'p,  when

                                                  '

Qai'non came near, ' I see you hunt your game just as I do. I always

catch my deer that way.' Qai'non was surprised to hear Snikla'p say

this, being under the impression that he himself was the only person who

hunted in this way. He said nothing, however, but hastened to cook

some of the venison. When the food was ready Snikla'p ate very

heartily, being very hungry, but could not eat all that had been prepared.

Wishing very much to take some home with him, he said to Qai'non :

' I think I will borrow your mat and take home some of this cooked meat

for my supper ; it will save me cooking to-night.' The other was quite

willing, and readily loaned him the mat. Snikla'p wrapped up all that

was left from their meal, and now took his departure, saying as he went,

'You must come and pay me a visit soon, and then you can get the mat.'^

myI like to have a visit from   friends.'  The day following Qai'non

thought he would return Snikia'p's visit. Approaching his house, he

shouted  down the  smoke-hole,  ' Good day, friend                                                                                                   I  have  taken you  at
                                                                                                                                                  ;

your word, and am come to have a little chat with you.' ' Oh, come in,

dear friend,' said unctuous Snikla'p, ' I am truly delighted to see you.'

But even as he spoke he felt in his heart that he would much rather his

visitor had remained at home ; and he wondered what he should do for a

dinner, having nothing in the house. However, he put on an air of

welcome, and entertained his visitor till dinner-time came. Said he then

to Qai'non, ' It is time I was looking after the dinner you must stay
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

and eat some with me.' To this Qai'non agreed rather more readily than

     ' The mat hero referred to was that ofl which they had been eating their dinner.
In the olden days the Indians of this district always made use of mats for table-
cloths. One or more of them was spread on the ground, and the food set out upon
them. They were made from reeds and swamp grasses, and were one of the

commonest articles of native furniture.

Snikld'p desired. 'I must get you some fresh meat,' he continued. '1

will run out and see if there is a deer in my trap.' Snikia'p now went

out and looked at his deer-ti'ap, which he had constructed after the plan

of Qai'non's. There was nothing in it. He had not really expected to

find anything, but he knew Qai'non was observing him, so he followed

the course he had seen Qai'non do. He now went into the wood, and

presently, to his surprise, came upon a fine buck. The buck looked

scornfully at him for a moment, but otherwise took no notice of him.

Snikia'p, remembering what Qai'non had done, began to call the buck ill

names. For some time the buck ignored his presence, but presently his

language became too bad, and the deer ran at him with antlers down to

punish him. Snikia'p turned tail, and ran as fast as his legs would

carry him in the direction of his trap, with the buck close behind him.

When he got close to the trap he made a leap to go through, as he had

seen Qai'non do, but he failed in his attempt, and stuck fast in the

middle, being unable to get through or go back. The infuriated buck

now took his revenge, and prodded poor Snikia'p with his sharp antlers

in his rear. Snikia'p howled with agony, and called upon Qai'non to

relieve and help him. Qai'non now came forward, killed the deer, and

relieved Snikia'p from the snare. 'You should not hunt in this way,'

said he to poor crestfallen Snikia'p ; ' you do not understand the trick.

I would advise you to stick to your own mode of hunting, and not copy

anybody else's.' Qai'non now cooked some of the deer for them, and

after the meal bade his friend good day, and returned to his own house.

It took Snikia'p some time to recover from the wounds inflicted upon him

by the angry deer ; but by the time he had consumed the remains of the
deer's carcase he was able to get about again. Having met with no luck

in his hunting, and being very hungry, he said to himself one day, ' I

think I will go and see Tzala's to-day ; maybe I can get a dinner from

Hehim.  set off on his visit, and presently came to Tzala's' house.

' Good day, neighbour Tzala's ; how are you feeling to-day ? ' said he, as
he looked down the smoke-hole. ' Is that you, friend Snikia'p 1 ' said

Tzala's very cordially. ' Come down and have a chat.' Snikia'p de-

scended. Says he, ' I was feeling lonely this morning, and thought I

would come over and see how you were getting on, and have a friendly

chat with you.' ' I am very glad you came,' amiably responded Tzala's,

and they chatted away together till dinner-time. Tzala's now said,
' You must have some dinner before you go ; but I can't let you eat this

dried fish,' ' and he pointed to the stores of dry fish that hung in abun-

dance from the rafters of his house. ' I'll just run out for a minute, and

mysee if I can't find some fresh fish in  traps.' Tzala's, thus saying, went

down to the river, which was at the time covered with a thick sheet of

ice. Every here and there, however, small openings appeared in the ice.

Pausing for a moment on the bank of the river over one of these, Tzala's

took a long breath, dived downwards, and shot through the hole. He

reappeared in a short time with a long string of fine fish. Snikia'p had

observed the action, and, as Tzala's returned, remarked, ' I see you catch

your fish as I do. I always dive for them that way myself.' ' Oh,

indeed,' said Tzala's the Diver ; ' I was not aware of that. I thought I
was the only one who fished in that way.' Tzala's said no nwre, but

    ' The rules of Indian hospitality demanded that a guest should be given the best

food procurable.

578 REPORT-- 1899*

speedily prepared the fish. Snikia'p ate very heartily, but some of the

fish were left over. These he coveted for himself. Said he presently,

' If you will lend me the mat, I think I will take a bit of this fish home for

my supper with me ; it will save me cooking to-night.' Tzala's made no

objection, and Snikia'p bundled the whole up in the mat, and then bade

his friend good bye. ' You must come and see me shortly,' said he as he
left ; 'I like my friends to pay me a visit sometimes.' Tzala's promised

to make an early call.

Next day Tzala's determined to redeem his promise and pay Snikia'p

a visit and bring home his mat. When he arrived at Snikla'p's house

Snikia'p was a little surprised to see him appear so soon, and was not too

well pleased ; but he made pretence to be overjoyed at his visit, and did his

best to entertain his visitor till dinner-time came. Seeing that Tzala's

was intending to stay to dinner, he thought he must do something to

prepare it. So he presently observed, 'You will stay and have some

dinner with me. I was just going down to the river to look at my traps

when you came. I'll just run down now and see what is in them.' So

saying he ran down to the river's edge. Tzala's watched him go, and

looked on with some curiosity. When Snikia'p got to the river he stood

a moment on the bank as he had seen Tzala's the Diver do, then took a

deep breath and plunged headforemost into the nearest vent-hole. But

he had miscalculated once more, the hole was not big enough to let his

body through. The force of his plunge had carried his head and shoulders

through, but then he had stuck fast and could now neither get up nor

down. He was thus in serious danger of drowning, and wriggled and

twisted his body frantically to free himself. Had not Tzala's been looking

on and seen the dilemma into which he had got himself, and hastened

down and released him, he would assuredly have been drowned. When

the good-natured Diver had got him out of the hole and had bound up

the cuts he had received in his struggles, he expostulated with him for

attempting to copy him in his methods of fishing. ' It's all very well for

--me to dive down through the ice it's my trade ; but you should not

attempt any such thing. You will surely get into trouble some day if

you interfere with other people's business.' So saying he plunged into

the river and presently returned with a string of fine fish. These he then

cooked, and together they made a hearty meal. After dinner he took his

mat and returned to his own house. The fish that were left over lasted

Snikia'p for some little time, after which he was again without food for

days, and was very hungry. This time he bethought him he would pay

Spate the Bear a visit. Reaching Spate's house he accosted him as he

had the others, and was invited in by the Bear, who presently, when

dinner-time came, brought out some berries in a dish and put them down

Hebefore the fire.  then washed his fore-paws, sat down close to the fire,

and held them over the dish close to the flame. In a little while the

Bear's claws began to drip with liquid fat, which he caught in the dish

containing the berries. When he had thus secured what he thought a

sufficient quantity of fat, he set the dish between himself and Snikia'p, and

together they made a hearty meal. They did not eat it all, however, and

Snikia'p said he would take what was left home with him if Spate would

lend hfm the dish. To this the Bear agreed, and also promised to pay

Snikia'p a visit at his house very shortly. Now, while Spate had been

drawing the fat from his paws, Snikia'p looked on for a moment and then

observed that he was in the habit of getting his grease in the same way,
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  579

Spate looked as if he did not believe him, but said nothing. Snikla'p

presently took his leave, carrying the remains of their dinner home with
him in the Bear's dish. The very next day Spate took it into his head to
return Snikia'p's visit and get back his dish. So just before dinner-time
he dropped in on Snikla'p. The latter made a great show of welcoming
him, and presently, when dinner-time came, got up to get the dinner.
Having no berries, he put the empty dish before the fire as he had seen

Spate do, then washed his paws, and, seating himself before the fire, held
them towards the flames. In a very little while the heat began to try
him and his paws began to smart ; but he would not let Spate see it, and
continued to hold them before the fire. Presently the pain made him

groan and writhe. ' What is the matter ? ' said Spate, who had been

closely observing him, Answered Snikla'p, ' The grease does not run

freely this morning, and I feel the heat a little.' ' You do not put them

close enough to the fire,' replied Spate. Snikla'p put his paws still closer
to the fire, and kept them there till the pain made him howl with agony.
Spate, in the meantime, smiled grimly, and when Snikia'p would have
given up he grasped his paws in his own and held them before the fire till
poor Snikia'p's flesh was burnt and his muscles drawn and twisted by the

great heat, saying as he did so, ' Let me hold your paws for you, dear
friend.' When he thought Snikla'p had been sufiiciently punished for his

humbugging and insincerity he let him go, and picking up his dish went
off home, leaving Snikia'p in a sad and disabled condition. It was some
time before his paws healed up, and even then they were not as before.
The cords and muscles had been so severely scorched that they I'emained
contracted, and he could never again stretch out his paws as before.

     Thus was Snikia'p the impostor punished by Spate, and thus it is that
the Coyote's paws are contracted and bent to this very day.

                        Story of Sa'nnCs Wife and the Revenge of her Son.

   A long time ago there lived at Tl'k'umtcln (Lytton) a chief who had

an only daughter who was very beautiful. The girl led a vei-y secluded life,
never being permitted to mix with the other girls or leave the house
except at night. The maid gets very tired of this dreary kind of life, and
one day begs her mother to allow her to go out and bathe in the river.
The mother at length consents to her going. She chooses a secluded spot

on the river's bank, disrobes there, and enters the water and swims about.

As she was thus engaged the young men of the Salmon tribe came up the

river. They came with the intention of seeking her in marriage, so
renowned had she become on account of her beauty. Four of her salmon
suitors came up in their canoe. Three of these were named respectively
Koie'ya (spring salmon), Swaas (' Sockeye ' salmon), and Ha'nni (hump-
back salmon). They happened to land just where the girl was bathing.

At first she did not see them, but presently, when they had landed and

she was about to come out of the water, she caught sight of them. Being
naked, she feels abashed and ashamed, and sits down in the water to hide
her person, and asks them to give her her clothes. The salmon reply that
they have come to take her away. They give her the clothes and take her
 away with them to the coast without further ceremony. They cast lots

 whose wife of them she shall be, and Ha'nni the Humpback salmon gets

drowned. The following year the Humpback Salmon husband, acoooi'

panied by all the other fish, canoed up the river to the girl's old home at

Lytton. As they neared the place two little river fish, the tcoktci' and

the ni'nEktcin, hastened on before and told the pai'ents that their daughter

was returning with the C(jast fish. Everybody is delighted to hear the

news, and the people paint their faces white and I'ed to sliow their joy.

The news of her arrival soon spreads far and wide, and the people of Nicola

heard of it among the rest. Now at this place there were many notable

men. Four of these, named respectively Ivoi'Ekin (AVolverine), N'Qoeni'ken

(Badger 1), Qua'kqoc (Marten), and Tcitc'q (Weasel), determined to go
down to Lytton and carry the girl off". They arrived during the night.

When they got there a great gambling bout was going on in the keekwilee-

house of the father of the girl. All the Fish people were there, as well as

Athe chief's own friends.  big fire had been built to light up the house,

that everybody might watch the game. The large crowd of people and

the big fire made the house very warm. The daughter begins to feel the

heat very trying. Presently she can stand it no longer, and asks to be

allowed to go out and get some fresh air. She is permitted to pass, and

climbs the notched pole that led through the smoke-hole. The four

Nicola men are just outside, and have observed all that took place. They

see the girl climbing the pole below them, and when her head appears at

the opening Tcitcq the Weasel makes a jump, and passes through her

mouth into her stomach. The girl is unconscious of what has taken

place, she only suddenly feels sick. When her head is out of the smoke-

hole Qua'kqoc the Marten leaps into her mouth and passes iato her

stomach. The girl at this feels as if she were half dead, and hastens to

get outside. But when she is partly out NQoeni'ken the Badger makes a

leap, and passes also into her stomach. She is fainting now as she steps

out from the hole ; and when Kui'lEkin the Wolverine follows his fellows

Aand jumps into her stomach she falls down dead.  little later, when

the others come out, they find her lying dead on the ground. Everybody

is in great distress, and the greatest medicine-man of the district is called

Hein to see if he can restore her to life again.  performs a great dance,

but all to no purpose. The young woman remains dead. Other medicine-

men now try their skill, but with no better success. They desist from

their eff"orts to restore her, and next day they bury her. The party now

breaks up, everybody being very sad. The Salmon and Coast fish return

home again. The night following, the Nicola chiefs, who had caused her

death in the way related, now restoi'e her to life, and return with her to

their own country. Here the young womaia lives with them. In course

of time a rumour of her presence among the Nicola tribe reaches her own

people. Word is sent all i-ound to all the camps and to all the Fish

Apeople of the coast.  meeting is convened at which war is declared by

the Fish tribe against the Nicola people, who are all members of the

Animal tribe. All the Coast fish, with Ho'atl the Sturgeon at their head,

swarm up the Fraser to Nicola. In such numbers did they come that

Athe upper river was too narrow and confined to hold them all.  fierce

battle now takes place between the Fish of the Coast and the Animals of

Nicola. The Animals came in from all parts to help their friends at

Nicola, and after a bloody conflict the Fish are beaten, and great numbers of

them are killed. Those that escaped from the fight are followed by the

victorious Animals, and not one of them, except the mighty armoured

Sturgeon, escapes to get back to the coast again. Even the great
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  581

Sturgeon is often hard pressed, and obliged to use strategy to get away
from his pursuers. It is to his efforts to thus escape that the winds and

turns and angles in the Fraser are due. He caused them to appear when

his pursuers were getting too near and embarrassing him.

     When the Sturgeon chief gets back to the coast, the son of the
captured woman is much grieved to hear of the disaster which has befallen his

tribe, and he determines to avenge the slaughter of his friends when older.

He thereupon undergoes a course of discipline and exercise to fit himself

to become a powerful medicine man. In course of time he acquires great

power. He now determined to take his revenge upon the Nicola men.
He goes up the river, and in time gets to Nicola. When he arrives he

goes to where his mother is. She does not recognise him in the tall and

liandsome man before her. The people are much surprised at the visit of

the stranger, but treat him hospitably. They inquire from what direction

he comes. He answers : ' From below.' The Grizzly, the Black-bear,

the Badger, the Wolverine, the Weasel, the Wolf, and the Coyote suggest
that they shall hold a great dance and test their medicine powers against

that of the stranger. He agrees, and that same night a great medicine

dance is held. They first let the fire out, and then they began the
contest, one by one. The Black-bear opens the dance, but he is a failure.
The others follow in due order, but none of them is able to do anything
very wonderful till Snikia'p the Coyote comes forward. Snikla'p has

power over the north wind, and can summon it at his will. When he

begins to dance the wind begins to rise. As he proceeds and his dancing

quickens, the wind increases in force and volume, till presently the very

ladder is shaking and the snow is falling fast. This dance is considered

a great success by his companions. When he stops, the wind and snows

stop too. It is now the stranger's turn. Before he begins he goes to his

mother and tells her she must go outside. She leaves the keekwilee-house.

As soon as she is gone he begins his dance, singing as he dances a fire

song : 'o'l, o'l, o'l, o'l,' &c. (stem of term 'fire,' as seen in the word d'ii/ip=:
to burn). Sparks now began to fly about, and presently sheets of flame
appear, and in a short time the house is on fire, and every one is much
frightened. The stranger stops and utters the word Aho'sa, and the fire
disappears. Snikla'p now dances a second time, and again the cold north

wind and the snow appear. ITa'iinl's son exhibits his power again in like

manner, and is followed a third time by Snikla'ji. The young man now

finds that he has the strongest medicine, and prepares to carry out his

scheme of revenge. He commences to dance a third time. This time he

sings his fire song louder, and dances more rapidly. Soon the flames
spread everywhere. They burn the house and the people, and when
everything is well on fire he gives a great jump, and leaps out through

the smoke-hole. Everybody is destroyed by the fire, and the slaughter

of his tribe is thus avenged. He now returns to the coast, taking his

mother back with him.

     The N'tlaka'pamuQ Indians account for the presence of the fish in the

rivers up country by yaying that when the Nicola Animals killed the
Coast Fish the spawn of many of the latter was left in the streams, which

later developed into fish. One of the effects, though, of the great licking
the Fish got is seen, they believe, in the form of the descendants of some

of them. For instance, the flat-headed river-cod is said to have inherited

his flat head from his ancestor, who was killed by a great blow, which

knocked his head flat.
582 REPORT--1899.

                                             General Remarks.

   A consideration of the foregoing folk-tales brings out many points of

interest. It will be seen, for instance, that the number 4 is an oft-
recurring number. It is undoubtedly the sacred mystic number of the
Salish stock, as we find it holding an equally predominant place in the

myths and stories of the Bella Coola tribe on the coast, between whom

and the N'tlaka'pamuQ there has been no intercourse from time imme-

morial. I am unable at present to say how far it is common to the

mythology of the other tribal divisions of this stock ; but finding it in
these two widely divergent branches separated by impassable physical

barriers, we may fairly conclude that it is common to the whole. Our

knowledge of the mythology of the other great divisions of the Salish is

not yefc very extensive if we except that of the Bella Coola recently pub-
lished by Dr. Boas ; and it will be interesting and profitable to gather
collections similar to these from all the other divisions. Whether all the

tribes of the Salish have such a store of folk-tales, or are as imaginative as

the N'tlaka'pamuQ, I am unable to say. That they possess more, or have
more active and lively imaginations, I much doubt, for it seems scarcely

possible to find a people more highly imaginative than the folklore of the
N'tlaka'pamuQ shows them to be, or rather to have been. There is not a
single peculiar feature of the landscape which has not its own story
attached to it. There is no conspicuous object of any kind within their
borders but has some myth connected with it. The boulders on the hill-
sides, the benches of the rivers, the falls, the cailons and the turns of the

Frazer, the mud slides, the bare precipitous cliffs, the sand bars, the

bubbling spring and the running brook, the very utensils they use, all

have a history of their own in the lore of this tribe. Every single pecu-

liarity in bird, or beast, or fish is fully and, to them, satisfactorily

accounted for in their stories. The flat head of the river cod, the top-
knot of the blue jay, the bent claws and dingy brown colour of the coyote,

the flippers of the seal, the red head of the woodpecker, and a host of
other characteristics, all have their explanation in story.

     Some of the tales here recorded are extremely valuable to us in the
glimpses they afford of the past and, for the most part, forgotten life,
customs, thoughts, and beliefs of this people. The intense repugnance in
which they held incestuous intercourse, the deep shame and disgrace that
followed a lapse from virtue in the unmarried of both sexes, and the
serious and damaging reflections it cast upon the parents, are portrayed in
the somewhat pathetic story of the sister who was wronged by her own
brother. The pains she took, and the lonely exile she bore to shield her
father's name from dishonour, and finally her own and her guilty brother's
self-destruction, all make this abundantly clear. Whether this story has
any foundation in fact, or whether it was told merely to inculcate virtue
and a hatred of incest, is quite immaterial. That it showed and embodied
the feelings of the people on this head is perfectly clear, and that is the
point which is of interest to us. The praise and enjoinment of virtue,
self- discipline, and abstinence in young men is no less clearly brought out,
while the respect and consideration paid by the young to the elders of the
family and tribe is an equally conspicuous virtue . In no other way could
we learn these things. The folk-tales alone can now recall the vanished
past for us. Hence their high value in ethnological inquiry, and the im-
portance of bringing them together and recording them while there is yet
opportunity. The pictures which these tales reveal to us of the ancient
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.     683

life and condition of these village communities is that of a i-ude and

simple, but virtuous people, living at peace among themselves under the

mild patriarchal sway of their local chiefs, who were assisted in their

Wegovernment by the elders of the tribe.  find them skilful and resource-

ful in the adaptation of means to ends, exhibiting at times remarkable

--ingenuity as witness their skill in basketry ; hardy and successful

hunters, preferring peace to war, but ready and prepared to defend their

homes and property when called upon to do so. The picture makes their

lives stand out in strong contrast to those of their congeners on the

coast, whose totemic and clan system, secret societies, ceremonial dances,

and other peculiar institutions find no counterpart here at all. If we

admit the pi'inciple that the simpler the life and institutions of a people

are, the nearer they are to their primitive original condition, we learn

from a consideration of these stories that the manners and customs and
life of the coast Salish have been much modified since the separation of

the stock into its present divisions. This, it may be pointed out, inci-

dentally confirms what Dr. Boas and other investigators have called atten-

tion to in their writings.

    It may be of interest to add here that a body of mythological matter,

collected by Mr. James Tait, of Spence's Bridge, B.C., from the upper

N'tlaka'pamuQ, has recently been published by the American Folklore

Society. I have not yet seen this, but I have no doubt a comparison of

the two will bring out many points of interest.

                                   Marriage Customs of the Yale Tribe.

     The following account of the marriage customs of the Yale tribe of the
Salish stock of B.C. was given to the writer by chief Mischelle, of Lytton,
whose father was a Yale Indian. These customs have been much modified
of late years. Some of the Indians are now married, after the manner of
the whites, by the priest or minister, some few retain the old customs,
and others unite the church service with the customs of their forefathers,
and thus go through what is practically a double marriage.

    Formerly, when a young man wished to marry a girl he went to the
house of her father at daybreak and squatted down just inside the door

with his blanket so wrapped about him that only his face was visible.

When the father rose he perceived the young man there, but passed by

him without taking any notice of his presence. All the other members of
the household did the same. They prepared the morning meal, sat down
to it, and still continued to ignore the young man's presence, who, as soon
as the meal was finished, quietly left the house without speaking. The
members of the girl's family make no comment upon the occurrence. The

following morning the young man enters the house and squats down again

by the door. After breakfast he departs still without speaking. After
his departure on this second occasion the father of the girl calls the family
and relatives together and discusses with them the eligibility of the suitor.
If acceptable to the family, when he presents himself next morning he is
invited to breakfast, and knows thereby that his suit is accepted. After
the meal is over, without in any way referring to the object of his visits,
he leaves the house, and in the course of a day or two sends a message to
the girl's father saying that he intends paying him a formal visit. The
girl's people make preparation to receive him and the friends who accom-
pany him. Accordingly at the time appointed, in company with his

friends, who all, as well as himself, bring gifts and food to the girl's father,
be makes his formal call, and presents the gifts of himself and friends.
584 REPORT--1899.

When these have been received they sit down to a feast to which all the

friends and relatives of both parties have been invited. After the feast is

over the bridegroom takes his bride and departs with her to his own

house. When two or three weeks have intervened, the wife's relatione

send word that they are coming to pay the young couple a visit of
ceremony. The young wife forthwith prepares a feast for them, and all
the young man's friends and relatives turn up again, together with those
of the wife. Presents of value equal to those given by the bridegroom
and his friends are now presented to him by the wife's father and friends,

after which all sit down to the feast prepared for the occasion. When

this is over, the marriage is regarded as consummated, and the two are

man and wife in the eyes of the whole community.

      But, on the other hand, should the suitor not be agreeable to the girl's

parents, the eldest male member of the girl's family is appointed to

acquaint the youth on his third visit that his advances are not acceptable

to the family, and that he had better discontinue his visits. On the third
morning, therefore, when the young man presents himself and squats
down in the customary place, the old man chosen for the office of mes-

senger goes over and informs him that the decision of the family is against
him, and that he had better seek a wife elsewhere. If the young
man's affections have not been very deeply engaged, he will accept his
dismissal and trouble them no more ; but if, on the contrary, he has set

his heart on getting this particular girl for his wife, he will now

go to the forest and cut down a quantity of firewood. He chooses for this

the best alder-wood he can find, as this is more highly esteemed than other
kinds among the Indians on account of its emitting no sparks when burn-
ing. This he will take to the house of the girl's father next morning at
daybreak, and start a fire for the inmates. If the girl's parents are serious
in their rejection of him as their daughter's husband, they will take both
fire and wood and throw them out of the house. The youth is in no wise
daunted by this, and repeats his action on the following morning, when
they again reject his services, and cast out the wood and fire as before.
But during that day, seeing his determination to get the girl for his wife,

 her people call another family council, at which the father points out to
those assembled the young man's perseverance and earnestness, and asks
for their advice under the circumstances. They all answer that he must
do what he thinks right and fitting. If the objection to the young man's

--suit has come perchance from the mother of the girl as it frequently
--does if she thinks the youth will not make a good food supplier for lier

daughter the father asks her what she now thinks about the matter.

 She will probably reply that if they refuse any longer to accede to the
 young man's wishes they will give him pain, so she withdraws her opposi-
tion. The girl is then for the first time in the ceremony consulted in the
 matter, but as lier desires are mostly what her parents wish, she rarely
dissents from the arrangement. The matter thus being satisfactorily
settled, the next morning, when the persevering youth presents himself
with his wood and builds a fire, some of the elder members of the family

come and sit round and warm their hands over it. By this action the

youth knows that his suit is at last accepted, and that his perseverance is

not to go unrewarded. He presently joins them at the morning meal, and

the conclusion of the affair from that moment follows the course already
described where the suitor was at the outset accepted.

I. Notes on the Yaraikanna Tribe, Cape York, North Queensland.
                          Bij Dr. A. C. Haddon, F.B.S.

The Yaraikanna are fairly typical Australians in appearance ; si.'c men wera

measured, average height 1'625 m. (5 ft. 4 in.), cephalic index 74'7 (extremes,
A724-77 -7).
              lad is initiated by his mawara, apparently the men of the clan

into which the boy must subsequently marry ; he is anointed with ' bush-medicine

in the hollow of the thighs, groins, hollow by the clavicles, temples, and back of

--knees to make him grow the bull-roarer is swung. In the Yanipa ceremony the

initiates (Janga) sit behind a screen in front of which is a tall pole, up which a man

climbs and catches the food thrown to him by the relatives of the langa. Then

the bull-roarer is swung and shown to the langa ; lastly, a front tooth of the langa

is knocked out, with each blow the name of a ' land ' belonging to the boy's mother

or of her father is mentioned, and the land, the name of which is mentioned when

the tooth flies out, is the territory of the lad. Water is next given to the hoy,
who rinses out his mouth and gently empties his mouth into a palm-leaf water

vessel ; the clot by its resemblance to some animal or vegetable form determines

the ari of the lad. The ari appears to be analogous to the manitu or okhi (or

* individual totem ' of Frazer) of the North American Indians. After the ceremony

the boy is acknowledged to be a man. Other ari may be given at any time by

men who dream of an animal or plant, which is the ari of the first person they

mept on awakening. The Okara ceremony was alluded to, and various customs,

among which may be noted, children must take the 'land' or 'country' of their

mother, a wife must be taken from another country, all who belong to the same

place are brothers and sisters,

II. Contributions to Comparative Psychology from Torres Straits and

                                                   Neio Guinea.

1. General Account and Observations on Vision, S)-c. By W. H. E. Eitees,

     Previous work on the psychology of savag;e peoples has heen limited to deduc-
tions from their behaviour, customs, and beliefs. The special object of the psycho-
logical work of the Cambridge Anthropological expedition was to employ exact

experimental methods in the investigation of the mental character of the natives

of Torres Straits and New Guinea. By means of these methods it is only possible

to investigate directly the more elementary mental processes, but in the course of
such work one meets indirectly with many facts which illustrate the higher and

more complex developments of mind.
     Observations were made in Murray Island by Messrs. McDougall, Myers, and

myself on about 150 individuals. The subjects investigated included visual acuity,

sensitiveness to light, colour vision, including colour-blindness, binocular vision,

and visual space perception ; acuity and range of hearing, appreciation of differences

of tone and rhythm; tactile acuity and localisation, sensibility to pain, estimation

of weight; smell and taste ; simple reaction times to auditory and visual stimuli,

and choice reaction  times                             estimation  of intervals of time ;  memory ;  strength  of
                                                    ;

grasp and accuracy of aim; reading, writing, and drawing; the influence of various

mental states on blood-pressure ; and the influence of fatigue and practice on

mental work.
     In Kiwai and Mabuiag fewer observations could be made, owing to the fact that

most of the apparatus had been taken on to Borneo, but observations were
made by Mr. Seligmann and myself on more than 100 individuals, many of

whom were not, however, natives of these islands. The subjects investigated were

chiefly visual acuity and colour vision; auditory acuity; smell and touch; writing

and drawing.

    It is not possible now to do move than give a rough sketch of our results. Most
of the methods used had been in some degree modified to meet the unusual condi-
tions, while some were new, and the consequence is that, with one or two
exceptions, we have very few data with which to compare our results. The
exact bearing of most of our observations will only become apparent when

comparative data on European and other races have been collected.
     Our observations were in most cases made with very little difficulty, and, with

some exceptions, we could feel sure that the natives were doing their best in all
we asked them to do. This opinion is based not only on observation of their

behaviour and expression while the tests were being can-ied out, but on the con-
sistency of the results. The small deviations of individual observations from the
average (mean variation) showed that the observations were made with due care

and attention.

The introspective side of psychological experimentation was almost completely

Weabsent.  were unable to supplement theobjective measurements and observations

by an account of what was actually passing in the minds of the natives while

making these observations. Attempts were made in this direction without much

success.

One general result was to show very considerable variability. It was

obvious that in general character and temperament the natives varied greatly

from one another, and very considerable individual differences also came out in our

Howexperimental observations.                          great the variations were as compared with those

in a more complex community can only be determined after a large number of

comparative data have been accumulated.
     Another general result which should be of great interest to anthropologists is that

the natives did not appear to be e.specially susceptible to suggestion, but exhibited
very considerable independence of opinion. Leading questions were found not to

be so dangerous as was expected. It is hoped that when our results are worked
out, it will be possible to express in some definite manner the suggestibility of

these people as compared with Europeans.
THE ANTHROPOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF TORRES STRAITS. 587

Of the special investigations undertaken by myself, that on visual acuity will

be the subject of a paper in another Section,

AThe colour vision of the natives was investigated in several ways.  hundred

and fifty natives of Torres Straits and Kiwai were tested by means of the usual

wool test for colour-blindness without finding one case. About eighty members of

other races, including Australians, Polynesians, Melanesians, Tamils, and half-castes

were also tested without finding one case, except among natives of Lifu. No'

less than three out of eight natives of this island were found to suffer from well-

marked red-green blindness of the ordinary type. Unfortunately the number of
Lifu natives who could be examined was too small to allow any definite conclu-

sions to be drawn, but the possibility is suggested that colour-blindness may be

a racial peculiarity, a fact which, if established, would be of great ethnological

importance.

_ The names used for colours by the natives of Murray Island, Mabuiag, and
Kiwai were very fully investigated, and the derivation "of such names in most

cases established. The colour vocabularies of these islands showed the special

feature v.hich appears to characterise many primitive languages. There were
definite names for red, less dehnite for yellow, and still less so for green, while a
definite name for blue was either absent or borrowed from English.

The three languages mentioned, and some Australian languages, seemed to
show different stages in the evolution of a colour .vocabulary. Several Australian

natives (from Seven Rivers and the Fitzroy Eiver) appeared to be almost limited to
words for red, white, and black. In Kiwai there was no word for blue, for which
colour the same word was used as for black, while the name applied to green

appeared to be inconstant and indefinite. In Murray Island the native word for
blue was the same as that used for blaclr, but the English word had been adopted
and modified into bidu-bulu. The language of Mabuiag was more advanced there
was a word for blue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

                     {maludgainulnga, sea-colour), but it was often also used for

green.

      CoiTesponding to this defect of colour terminology, there appeared to be an
actual defect of vision for colours of short wave-length. In testing with coloured

wools, no mistake was ever made with reds, but blues and greens were constantly
confused, as were blue and violet. The same deficiency in seeing blue seemed also
to be shown in experiments on the threshold of sensitiveness for red, yellow, and
blue, carried out with Lovibond's tintometer. Experiments on the distance at
which small patches of different colours could be recognised also showed great
inferiority in seeing blue as compared with red, but the few comparative observa-
tions so far made do not enable one to say that there is any striking difference
between Europeans and Papuans in this respect.

     Observations were also made on the colour vision of the peripheral retina, on
after-images, and on colour contrast.

     Observations were made by means of Hening's fall experiment which showed
the existence of binocular vision in all except one man with an orbital tumour.

     Quantitative observations were made on some visual illusions.
     Numerous observations were made on writing and drawing, the former chiefly
in the case of children. The most striking result here was the ease and correctness
with which mirror writing was performed. In many cases native children, when

asked to write with the left hand, spontaneously wrote mirror writing, and all

were able to write in this fashion readily. In some cases children, when asked to

write with the left hand, wrote upside down.

     Experiments were made on the estimation of time. The method adopted was
to give signals marking off a given interval ; another signal was then given as the
commencementof a second interval, which the native had to finish by a similar
signal when he judged it to be equal to the given interval. This somewhat difficult
procedure met with unexpected success, and intervals of 10 seconds, 20 seconds,
and one minute were estimated with fairly consistent results.

     Nearly all the investigations gave some indication of the liability to fatit^ue
and the capability for improvement by practice, but these were also the subject of
a special investigation earned out by modifications of Kraepelin's methods.

                2. Observations on Hearing, Smell, Taste, Meaction Time, Src

                                         By C. S. Myees.

     The conditions for testing acuity of hearing were very unfavourable on
IMurray Island, owing to the noise of the sea and the rustle of the cocoanut palms.

Tl e general results of many experiments lead me to conclude that few Murray

Is^aiders surpass a hyper-acute European in auditory acuity, while the majority
cannot hear as far. For the determination of the upper limit of the perception of
tcne I used Ilawksley's improved form of Galton's "Whistle. Of the fifty-one

Murray Islauders who were investigated, all save one readily appreciated the

difference between the pure high note and the noise of the blast that is inseparable

from it. Experiments were also made to determine the minimum perception of
tone-differences. Twelve islanders were tested for their sense of rhythm; this
was found to be remarkably accurate for 120 beats of the metronome to the minute,
and somewhat less so for 60 beats. Most of the subjects had a tendency to vary

in the direction of increasing the rate of the taps.

      Olfactometry is very difficult to prosecute for various reasons. Until I have

made further comparative observations on Europeans, I can draw no certain con-
clusions as to the relative smell-acuity of the former and the Murray Islanders

but so far as my experiments go, they seem to indicate no marked superiority in

the development of this sense among the i.slanders. Doubtless hyper-acuity is
more common among them, but there seems no reason to believe that they are able
to perceive such traces of odour as would be imperceptible to the most sensitive
European noses.

     Experiments were made to determine the appreciation and recognition of tte

--common tastes sweet, salt, bitter, and acid. Sugar and salt were readily recog-

nised, acid was compared to unripe fruit ; the bitter is the most uncertain
evidently there is no distinctive name for it in the Murray Island vocabulary.

    Bluet's diagram used for testing visual memory was employed on twenty-eight

people with interesting results.
     iS^umerous time reaction experiments were made, more on simple auditory re-

action than on simple visual reactions ; a few visual choice reactions were also
made. The time of the simple reaction is not sensibly longer, but probably in

many cases even shorter, than would be that given by a corresponding class of
Europeans. The experiments clearly showed the great difference of temperament
among the individuals investigated. There was at one extreme the slow, steady-
going man who reacted with almost uniform speed on each occasion ; at the other
extreme was the nervous, high-strung individual who was frequently reacting
prematurely, and whose mean variation in consequence was relatively great. Yet
tlie mean variation, save in the choice-times, was extraordinarily low for such

unpractised people.

3. Observatioiis on the Sense of Touch and of Pain, on the Estimation of Weight,

               Variations of Blood-Pressure, ^-c. By W, McDotigall.

     The power of discrimination of two points by the sense of touch was investi-

gated in a series of fifty adult males. On half the number of subjects the obser-

vations were made on the skin of the thumb, of the second toe, and of the nape of

the neck, and on the skin of forearm on all the subjects. There was a general

correspondence of delicacy of discrimination in the difi'erent parts of the skin tested

Ain any one subject.  few of the subjects showed a very much greater delicacy of

discrimination than the others, while the latter showed a fairly uniform delicacy

which is considerably greater than that shown by the short series of white men

who have been tested by the same method.

Observations on the sensitivity to pain produced by simple pressure on the skin

were made by means of Cattell'a algojneter. With this instruoient it seems to be
THE ANTHROPOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF TORRES SlJlAtTS. 589

possible to register accurately the point at which, with increasing pressure, a
painful element is first perceived. The sensitivity to pain as thus determined
seemed to be, roughly, inversely proportional to the delicacy of touch discrimina-
tion in the series of individuals, and in the whole series the sensitivity seemed to

be distinctly less than in the short series of white men observed.
     Similar series of observations were made on thirty children. It should be

understood that the degree of pain produced was iu all cases so slight as not to
spoil the pleasure and interest of subjects in the proceedings.

     The accuracy of localisation of touch sensations was also measured iu a number
of the same subjects, and temperature spots were mapped out in a few.

     In the same subjects a series of observations on the delicacy of discrimination
of differences of weight was made, and other series were made with the purpose of

--determining the degree of suggestibility of the people the effect of size as appre-

ciated by sight and grasp on the judgment of weight. It was interesting to find
that although the abstract idea of weight seemed entirely new to the minds of
these people, and no term in their language aus%\ered to it exactly, yet their power
of discrimination of difference is at least as good as our own.

     In the same series of people the blood-pressure was observed by means of
Ilill and Barnard's sphygmo-manometer during rest, muscular work, mental work
and excitement, and slightly painful skin-pressure, and marked variations recorded

under these conditions. No series of observations on white men under similar
conditions have yet been made for comparison.

III. The Linguistic Results of the Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits

                     and New Guinea. By Sidney H. Ray.

The geographical position of the Torres Straits Islands renders an accurate

knowledge of the construction of the languages important, especially for determining

the relation of the Australian languages to those of New Guinea and the Malay

Archipelago, and also, perhaps, to languages further west in Southern India and

the Andaman Islands. Several missionaries have worked among the Eastern and

Western tribes of the Straits, and the existing gospel translations are reputed to

have been made by them, but no one has preserved any record of, or can throw

any light upon the construction of the languages. The translations were analysed

iu a former work by Dr. Haddon and myself,' but the result was somewhat

unsatisfactory. As we had dealt exhaustively with the vocabularies, my atten-
tion during my stay in the islands was mainly concentrated upon the grammars

of the two languages.

The construction of the Eastern (Murray and Darnley Islands) language was

found to be very complex, modifications of sense being expressed by an elaborate

system of prefixes and suffixes.

The grammar bears no resemblance to the Melanesian, and but little to the

Australian. The speech used in school and church is a debased form of the

myoriginal ; as  native informant described it, ' they cut it short.' As most of the

young people know English, it is very probable that the pure language will die

out with the older folk.

The language of the "Western tribe was studied at the central island of

Mabuiag, but the closely allied dialects spoken on AVarrior Island, Saibai, and

Prince of Wales Island, were also investigated. The grammar of this language is

decidedly of Australian type, though there is no marked connection in structure or

vocabulary with languages of the neighbouring mainland. Of these latter, the dialect

of the Yaraikanna tribe in the neighbourhood of Cape York was also investigated.

    In New Guinea, at Port Moresby, the Motu language is well known, and I

used it as the means of obtaining from Koitapu natives some illustrations of their

strange language. The results show that there are people living in the Motu

villages, whose languages are totally distinct from that of the Motu both In structure

Aand vocahulary.  language (Koiari) similar to the Koitapu was found to

prevail in the district inland from Port Moresby.

At Port Moresby I also obtained from some Cloudy Bay natives specimens of

their language, which, like those of Koitapu and Koiari, approaches the Australian

type, but has nothing in common with the Melauesian.

At Bulaa (Hula), Hood Peninsula, the structure of the dialects of Bulaa,

Keapara (Kerepunu), and Galoma were the subject of conversations with Kima,

the intelligent chief of Hula. These dialects are related to the Motu, and, like

it, are in grammar and vocabulary very closely akin to the languages of the

Melanesian Islands. -

     At Saguana in Kiwai Island in the Fly Hiver Delta, I took advantage of a
fortnight's stay to make a lirst investigation into Kiwai and Mowata grammar.
The language is very difficult, with exceedingly complex forms. It shows some

traces of connection with the speech of the Eastern Islanders of the Torres

Straits.

                  IV. Seclusion of Girls at Mabuiag, Torres Straits.

                                  By C. G. Seligmann.

     "When the signs of puberty appear, a circle of bushes is made in a dark corner
of the girl's parents' house. The girl, now called Kerngi gasamcm, is fully decked
with cross shoulder-belts of young cocoanut leaf, with leglets just below the knee,
with anklets, with petticoat, with chaplet round head, with armlets of cocoanut
with cut dracfenas in them ; with shell ornaments huug on front and hack of chest,

and with nautilus shell ornaments in her ears. She squats in the centre of the
bushes, which are piled so high round her that only her head is visible. This
lasts for three months, the bushes being changed nightly, at whicli time the
girl is allowed to slip out of the hut. She is attended by one or two old women,

the girl's maternal aunts, who are especially appointed to look after her. These
women are called Moioai by the girl ; one of them cooks food for the girl at a
special fire in the bush. The girl may not feed herself or handle her food, it being

--put into her mouth by her attendant women. No man not even the girl's
--father may come into the house ; if he saw his daughter during this time he

would certainly have bad luck with his fishing, and probably smash his canoe the

first time lie went out. The girl may not eat in the breeding season turtle or
turtle eggs ; no vegetable food is forbidden. The sun may not shine on her; * he
can't see daytime, he stop inside dark,' said my informant. At the end of three

months a girl is carried to the fresh-water creek by her MfAvai, she hanging on to
their shoulders so that not even her feet touch the ground, the women of the tribe
forming a ring round the girl and Mowai, thus escorting her to the creek. Her
ornaments are removed, and the Mowai with their hurden stagger into the creek,

where the girl is immersed, all the women joining in splashing water over the
three. On coming out of the water, one of the Moicai makes a heap of grass for

her charge to squat on, while the other runs to the reef and catches a small crab.
She tears off its claws, and with these she runs back to tlie creek, where a fire has
meanwhile been made, at which the claws are roasted. The girl is then fed on
these by the Mowed. She is then freshly decorated, and the whole party marches

back to the village in one rank, the girl being in the centre, with the Mowai at her
side, each of them holding one of the girl's wrists. The husbands of the Mowai,
called by the girl Waduam, receive her, and lead her into the house of one of
them, where all eat food, the girl being now allowed to feed herself in the usual

manner. The rest of the community have meanwhile prepared and eaten a feast,

and a dance is held, in which the girl takes a prominent part, her two Waduam
dancing, one on each side of her. When the dance is finished the ilfowa* lead the

girl into their house and strip her of her ornaments. They then lead her back to

her parents' house.

      V. Notes on the Club Houses and Duhus of British Nevo Guinea.
                                  By C. G. Seligmann.

     One or more houses larger aud more highly decorated than the rest, called in
the Gulf and JMekeo districts elamo and marea respectively, are to be seen in every

village of these parts of British New Guinea. No women may enter these, they

are the club houses of the men, the home of the unmarried youths, and strangers
are quartered there. Each family or family group, called itzubu in the Mekeo

district, is responsible for the upkeep of one of these. Among the Toaripi mucli

stress is laid on the convenience and advantage of an rhimo in keejjing the young
men from the women's quarters, and their legend of the origin of the elamo relates

how one of their ancestors, called IMeuliave, was visited by Avara Laru, who rules
the N.W. squalls, who bade him build a house for the unmarried youths into
which no woman might come. Infringement of these rules is still met by Avara
Laru destroying the elamo. Wooden effigies of birds and fishes are hung outside

--elamos, but these arc not reverenced the beast they represent is eaten when

opportunities ofler, aud the family group is not called by their name. East of
Delena elamos or mareas are not found, but their place is taken by the dubii, a
platform, often two-storied, with elaborately carved corner posts and cross-pieces
stretched longitudinally across the tops of these, which are hollowed to receive

them. One man called Dubu Taima, from each principal family of a family
group {iduhu), looks after and is responsible for the dubu. The office is hereditary,
not necessarily in the direct line. Women may not approach the diihu except on
the Hood Peninsula, where once a year the girls who have become marriageable
assemble on the dubu. The products of the garden and chase are sometimes hung
oa the dub2(,, which may rarely be painted red and white. Semon ^ notes that he
has seen skulls hung on one, but does not state where. Before fighting, warriors

fully decked and armed resort to the dubu and there mutter the names of their

ancestors. After killing a man the successful warrior would, on his return to the

village, go straight to the dubu, aud on it eat his first meal. But little could be
determined as to the meaning of the carving, the origin of the dubus themselves
being unknown to the natives. At Qualimarupu there is a carefully excavated
hollow in one of the corner posts, said to represent a bowl. The pattern, as a rule,
is made up of a number of four-sided pyramids carved on the wood, and the tops
of the corner posts are carved so as to resemble jaws, between which the cross-
pieces rest. Perhaps these represent the jaws of a crocodile, the pyramids being
conventionalised scales. This form of decoration is, however, found among inland
people whose acquaintance with crocodiles must have been but slight.

                    VI. Notes on Savage Music. Bij C. S. Myers.

     As our modern orchestra admits the noises of drums and cymbals, and our
harmony allows chords which in a more classical period were inadmissible, we, in

our inquiry into past and primitive music, will not refuse to consider certain sounds
as musical even though they be noisy. Sympathy should be our sole test of music.
In savage life the songs of a tribe are its chief heritage. Certain songs recorded on

the phonograph in Murray Island, Torres Straits, are now obsolete, and will pro-

bably die out with the old men. Neither there nor in Borneo could any trace of the
notes of birds be found in the music. Of the two fundamentally distinct elements
in music, rhythm and melody, the one has its basis in bodily movement, the other in
the emotional recitative. In Murray Island the drum is beaten to accentuate the
words of the old songs, the music being singularly lacking in rhythm ; among the
North American Indians, on the other hand, rhythm is well developed. The ex-
traordinary complexity of rhythm in certain Malay music was graphically recorded.

592 EBPORT-- 1890,

The Murray Islanders have a wonderfully developed idea of rhythm, as is proved

by their being' able regularly to continue accurately recorded beats of prescribed

rapidity for a considerable period. Many suggestions have been made as to which

of the intervals came most natm-ally to the human voice. The Murray Islanders

have no polyphonic music, but in a chorus accompanying the songs of the Kenyah

and allied races in Borneo a long-drawn note a fifth below the key-note runs

Adrone-like through the song.                                                                                                                                            similar interval has been noted in one of the rare

examples of polyphonic music found in North America.

Writers have been led to conclude that various peoples employed far smaller

intervals than our own, misled apparently by viewing the numerous intervals as if

they formed a scale instead of a series of notes from which various scales were de-

rived. In this way travellers have been induced to look for quarter-tone music in

uncivilised parts of the world                                                                                                                                           but the author  has  no  doubt  that those quarter-
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

tones, which have been written down as occurring between any two whole (or

semi-) tones, merely express a gradual descent in the voice from one of these tones

to the other. The insensitiveness of the ear of the Murray Islanders to minute

differences of interval was estimated by means of tuning-forks. The common in-

correct intonation in savage music was alluded to.

--PJiotographs of Anthropological Interest. Report of the Committee,

     consisting of Mr. C. H. Eead (Chairman), Mr. J. L. Myres
     (Secretary), Dr. J. G. Garson, Mr. H. Ling Roth, Mr. H.

     Balfour, Mr. E. S. Hartland, and Professor Flinders Petrie,

     appointed for the Collection,, Preservation, and Systematic Regis-

      tration of Fhotographs of Anthropological Interest.

This Committee was appointed by the British Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science in September 1898, to provide for the ' Collection,
Preservation, and Systematic Registration of Photographs of Anthro-

pological Interest.'

   A similar Committee on Geological Photographs was appointed in

1889, and has organised the valuable collection preserved in the Museum

of Practical Geology. The Royal Geographical Society has gradually
collected a large number of geographical photographs, many of which are
also of anthropological interest. More recently the Hellenic Society has
announced a large special collection for the use of students of the topo-

graphy, civilisation, and art of Greece. And the Anthropological Institute

possesses a considerable collection of photographs, which have been lately
mounted and classified ; and has permitted the registration of these in the
list of the new Anthropological Photographs Committee.

     The considerations which led to the appointment of this Committee

are briefly as follows :

   A(1) very large number of Anthropological phenomena can only be

studied in the field, or by means of accurate reproductions ; but the latter

are in many cases difficult to procure, except where typical examples have

been regularly published ; and even then it is frequently of advantage to
be able to acquire separate copies of single plates or illustrations, for pur-
poses of comparison, without breaking up a collection or a volume.

    (2) On the other hand, most travellers, collectors, and museum officials
find it necessary to make many photographic negatives in the course of
their own work, for which they themselves have no further use, but which
       ON PHOTOGRAPHS OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL INTEREST.      593.

they would gladly make accessible to other students, if any scheme existed
by which this could be done without trouble to themselves. Such nega-
tives also accumulate, and take up valuable space ; and are very liable to
damage through neglect.

     (3) Further, though many professional photographers in remote parts

of the world have jnade admirable use of their oiDportunities of recording
native types, customs, and handiwork, there has hitherto existed no single
record of what has been done in this direction ; with the result that valu-
able collections have remained practically inaccessible to those in whose
interest they have been made. In the case of the Hellenic Society,
already cited, the inclusion, in the reference collection, of selected prints
from the negatives of professional photographers abroad has been found

to be of great advantage to teachers and students, who consult it with
the view of choosing the best representations to add to their own series.

     Wliat appears therefore to bo required is, in the lirst place, a register

of the photographic neg.itives wliich can be made generally available,

illustrated by a permanent print from each, preserved at an accessible
centre ; together with an arrangement by which properly qualified

students may be enabled to have duplicate prints made from them for
their own use, at a reasonable price. In any such scheme it is understood

that the copyright, for purposes of publication, remains with the owner
of the negative, and that all duplicate prints distributed under this
arrangement are subject to that qualification.

     In establishing such a Register and Collection of Anthropological
Photographs, the Committee invites the co-operation of all owners of
suitable photogi-aphic negatives, who are requested to submit for regis-
tration one unmounted print from each negative (which will be mounted
by the Committee and preserved either at the office of the British Asso-
ciation, or in some central and accessible place) ; together with a full
description of the photograph. The latter should state :

     (1) The subject of the photograph, and the place where the original
subject is (or was) to be found, the date when the photograph was taken,
and name of the person who took the photograph.

     (2) The name and address of the owner of the negative.
     (3) The whereabouts of the negative itself : i.e. whether it is retained
by the owner at his own address, or deposited with a professional photo-

grapher at an address named, or with the Committee.
     (4) The terms on which prints, enlargements, and lantern slides will

be supplied when ordered through the Committee.

     The Committee has made arrangements for the storage and insurance
of any negati\es which may be deposited on loan, and for the production
of prints and lantern slides from them to order ; and a number of negatives

have already been so deposited.
     The Secretary of the Committee will be glad to supply forms for the

registration of negatives, and any further information which may be
required. It is hoped that it may be possible to publish a lirst list of

photographs in the next report.

We regret that from unavoidable reasons the excavations of the Marsh

Village near Glastonbury could not be reopened this summer, but the
investigations will be continued another year, and the examination of the

site 25roceeded with until completed. Notwithstanding the discontinuance
of the excavations this year, an important amount of work has been
accomplished since our last report was presented at the Bristol Meeting

last autumn.
     The excavated ground mentioned in the following report was situated

at the centre and west side of the village, and includes fifteen dwelling
mounds and the ground around them. The more important dwellings were

the following :

--AP.P.    large mound situated near the west border of the village

composed of four horizontal layers of clay one foot thick. Near the centre

of the mound there were ten superimposed hearths. The timber founda-

tion was strongest at the south and south-west sides of the mound, and

overlying the entire surface of the timber was a layer of rushes one foot

thick, compressed to such an extent that it both cut and looked like wood
when making a section. Amongst the timber and vegetable debris in the
foundation of this mound were dug up a finely turned wheel-spoke, and
many fragments of pottery and bones, some very complete and well

preserved hurdle work, evidently part of a dwelling wall fallen flat ; near

this there were also a number of pieces of cut wood, the base of a wooden
tub, a wood mallet, and a wheel cut from the solid fifteen inches in

diameter.

E EMound         consisted of three floors of clay, the total tliickness of

which was 2 feet 9 inches ; the dwelling that was contemporary with the

middle floor was evidently destroyed by iire. This mound was noteworthy

for the number of baked clay sling pellets, and for a human skull, the

latter object being discovered amongst the timber under the centre of the

dwelling.

    Mound C C was in size an unimportant one, but M^as interesting in

many ways. It consisted of four layers of clay of irregular outline ; it
contained as many as ten hearths ; the timber foundation was slight,

except under the lowest hearth, where it formed a square platform from

portions of two glass beads, fifteen pieces of cut horn, including seven
weaving combs. There wore also objects of iron, lead, tin, and Kim-
meridge shale, four quern stones, fifteen spindle whorls, and the usual
quantity of pottery in fragments, bones, and baked clay. Since the last
report was read. Dr. J. H. Gladstone has very kindly made an exhaustive

examination and analysis of the metals, and in his three valuable reports

he says :--

                                                      Report A.

    I have examined the specimens you kindly sent me from the Lake

Village both by the microscope and chemical analysis. The following are

the results arrived at :

  --No. 1 Bronze. This consisted of thin strips of metal, evidently coated

with oxide. The smaller piece was analysed just as it was, and gave

Copper      00-8 per cent.
Tin         23-5 ditto

There was a little iron, but no lead or silver was found, nor any sulphur.

The deficiency on analysis must have been almost wholly oxygen. As

the tin is in such unusual proportion, I scraped the surface of both sides
of the larger strip, and obtained a very thin plate which showed metallic
lustre. This, pretty nearly freed from the crust of oxide, was analysed as
before, and then gave

Copper      80-7 per cent.
Tin         15-7 ditto

There was a small quantity of iron. The scrapings from the surface
proved to be almost entirely oxide of tin, but contained small quantities
of copper and iron. It was evident that in the slow decomposition of
this bronze, the copper had mostly disappeared while the tin remained in

the crust as the insoluble oxide. It is also evident that the original
bronze did not contain 23 per cent, of tin, which would be a very unusual
amount, but even 15 per cent, is a rich bronze, such as might be expected

v/here tin ore abounded. The absence of lead is significant, as that metal

was generally one of the components of Roman bronze of the period.

  --No. 2. The lump of rust-coloured substance which surrounded the

bronze was found to be peaty matter infiltrated with iron oxide. There
was no tin, but a little copper, which doubtless had dissolved from the
adjoining metal. The second specimen was of very much the same

character.

  --No. 3. This black powder is not antimony, but finely pulverised

galena (sulphide of lead). I find it leaves a black mark if rubbed on the
skin ; and from the articles with which it was associated I presume it was

--used for the same purpose as stibium.
     No. 4. ^This white metal is pure tin, containing no silver, lead, or
copper in perceptible quantity. It had a slight crust of black oxide of

tin. The black powder, which you sent me in the same box, when

examined microscopically, was found to be minute fragments of quartz
encrusted with tinstone. This suggests that the fine sand containing
stream tin was carefully collected, and smelted in the village. It is
interesting to note that metallic tin was used for a finger ring in Egypt,

                                                                                 QQ2

was found that some particles of the unreduced black oxide were dispersed

T have made a careful analysis of the metallic rod from the Glaston-

bury village, both microscopically and chemically. For the purpose of
gaining an insight into the interior of the main portion, I have bored a

hole halfway through at about the middle of the rod, and a smaller one
at about a quarter of an inch from one of the bronze terminals. They

both revealed a central core of metallic tin covered by a very hard, but

somewhat brittle, crust ; in the first case, about one-eighth of an inch
thick, and in the second about one-twelfth. This inner core gave on

analysis 98 "5 per cent, of tin. It may therefore be considered a very pure

specimen of that metal.

The crust of the products of oxidation exhibited under the microscope

great varieties of the o;fides of tin, varying from semicrystalline pale

yellow pieces, to amber, reddish brown, and nearly black groups of minute

Acrystals.  portion analysed gave 85 per cent, of the oxide of tin, small

quantities of other mineral matter, about 5 per cent, of gold, and some

4 per cent, of combined water. All appearances indicate that this crust

has resulted from the slow oxidation of the tin rod in a marshy soil. As

no gold could be found in the interior tin, it is probable that the rod was

originally gilded in part or whole, and that the gold found in the crust

was due to this. One of the striking features of this crust is the number

of irregular longitudinal cracks, in some of which there is metal which

appears to have been squeezed up from below. This is doubtless due to

the gradual oxidation of the tin under the crust that was first formed.

As the oxide of tin occupies a much larger bulk than the metal from

which it is made, there must have been a great pressure from within, and

this has burst the outer crust just as the growth of many tree stems causes

the bark to split. Another feature is that the external crust is pitted

with a large number of little crater-like depressions, commonly of about

one-twelfth of an inch in diameter, but some very minute, and others

attaining to the size of a quarter of an incli. This does not appear to be

due to any external cause, but rather to the tendency of the oxide of tin

to arrange itself in this form.

     The terminal pieces have been made of bronze ; but at least two differ-

ent qualities have been employed. They are also much corroded and rent
Aby fissures.
               piece of the alloy pretty well separated from the disinte-

grated crust gave on analysis

                  ....Tin                   l.H-5 per cent.

                  Copper                    78-2   ,,

                  Oxj'gen. &c.   .  .       . 8-3  ,,

     It was, therefore, a bronze of no unusual composition, though with
rather more than the average amount of tin. Into each of these terminals

there seems to have been inserted a piece of bronze very much richer in
tin, and which has been almost entirely oxidated. The tin has become

cassiterite ; the copper is changed into the black oxide. It seems impos-
sible from these decomposed bronzes to say with any accuracy what has
been their original constitution. In the case of one piece taken from thp

wedge, analysis shows at least twice aS much tin as copper, besides a good
proportion of iron oxide, and a little alumina and lime, and much organic
matter and water. These latter constituents were doubtless derived from
the marsh in which the rod had been lying for so many centuries.

     The specific gravity of the whole object is 6-78. This agrees fairly
v/ith what may be calculated from the relative amounts of tin and tin
oxide, with the bronze terminals, showing that it is solid throughout.
The slight double bend in the bar is probably due to the inequality of the
support during these ages. Even very rigid substances will sufler such

changes in long periods of time.

     There remains the question as to the purpose for which it was made.
Originally, it probably appeared as a round bar of white metal, orna-
mented with gold, capped at each end by a bronze terminal. This suggests
the idea of some official mace or sceptre, sufficiently strong and heavy to
serve as a weapon if so required.

                                                           Meport C.

     I have examined all the metallic objects which you sent me recently.

First I thought it best to take the specific gravity of each, as that could
not injure the specimens in any way, while it might give good indications

as to the metals of which they are composed. The accompanying paper

gives their specific gravity, arranged from the highest to the lowest. You

will see that the objects fall into two groups ; four of them having a
specific gravity approaching that of lead (11-4) and the others that of tin
(7-3). In all cases the actual specific gravity is too low, but as the objects
are all more or less oxidated, mixed perhaps with some earthy matter, we

may expect such to be the case. The density of L 21 was not taken, as it

was manifestly an unwrought piece of melted tin, probably oxidated by

exposure to the air while still hot.

    LTo commence with the larger group, that of tin 1 2, the largest object,

is proved by its density, as well as its general appearance, to be a solid

ball of metallic tin, only very slightly oxidated ; while, on the other hand,
the three last in the table are possibly oxidated all through, as the specific
gravity of tin oxide itself is about 6-7.

    As to the four which are classified as lead, the first two would appear

to be not far removed from pure metal, with a slight crust of suboxide

(specific gravity 9-7) and of carbonate (6-5) ; but L 15 and L 25 are a

good deal lighter, though they do not seem to be much oxidised. They
both have brown patches on a yellowish white crust, and under the micro-
scope there are indications of the ridges, cracks, and small shiny spheres

which are seen in the crust of undoubted specimens of tin from Glaston-
bury. I thought it worth while, therefore, to cut off a small piece from the

end of the coiled ring L 25. The result of the analysis, after removing

the white mcrustation asmucli as possible, showed 95-5 per cent, of lead
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

besides this there was some other substance which had all the appearance

of insoluble tin oxide. Supposing it to be really tin, it is so small in
quantity, that it probably arises from some accidental mixture of tinstone
with the ore from which the metal was reduced, and can hardly be looked
upon as having been purposely added. They, therefore, rather support
than contravene the opinion that the art of making powtcr was not
practised in Britain before the time of the Romans.

UN ELECTRICAL CHANGES.

Medrical Changes accompanying the discharge of the llespiratorii

     F. GOTCH, and Mr, J. S. Macdonald. {Brawn nj) hy Mr. J. S.

         Further Examination of Changes in Phrenic Nerve and their

               co)n2}arison witlt, Simidtaneoios State of Blood Pressure.

The further prosecution of research has taken the form of an inquiry

into the nature of part {if any) flaued hy alterations of hlood pressure in
the causatiott of electrical phenomena observed in tlie iihrenic nerve.

     In a nerve well supplied with blood-vessels, and with a circulation
preserved in such good condition as that noted in experiments, errors
might be introduced by such alterations in several ways.

    (A) By alteration of volume of blood and lymph in nerve, and so of

conducting media external to electrically disturbed tissue. '^

    By such means a change, produced in the relative proportion of current

derived through galvanometer circuit, might in records give rise to an
apparent change of total current.

    (B) By action of changes of blood pressure upon the walls of vessels

or upon the flow of blood through them, setting up electromotive changes
of entirely different origin from intrinsic changes in nervous tissue.

    (C) By direct effect of alterations of circulation upon the nervous

tissue itself, especially in nerve partially dried and cooled from exposure,
giving rise to intrinsic alterations in current of injui-y by altering condi-
tions of moisture, temperature, presence of waste products, <fec., affecting its

development.

     There were considerations which made it improbable that such causes
were at work in the production of current changes observed in phrenic
nerves. Amongst these may be mentioned

     (1) The constancy of base line in tracings.
     (2) The character of the rhythmical oscillations, the first part of each
of which bore evidence of being a true negative variation ; the second part,
as observed both in galvanometer and electrometer, being due to return of
instrument to rest at a rate determined by instrumental elasticity.
     (3) The observation that phenomena in phrenic ceased when blood
pressure was still considerable, and the heart continued its beat.

     It was, indeed, anticipated that the relation between circumstances was
really in a reverse order. That the phenomena, being genuine indications
of large discharges from respiratory centre, would probably, in their most
extreme form, be accompanied by discharges of vasomotor centres leading
to alterations of blood pressure ; and not that such indirectly caused
changes of blood pressure would declare themselves so obviously by
indirect effects upon injury current of phrenic nerves.

     It was, however, deemed advisable to satisfy any criticism upon pre-
sence of errors of this nature by as careful as possible an estimation of

                                               ' Source of current of injury.
                                   --

their value. To do this it did not seem necessary, or even advisable, to
confine the research to direct experiments upon the phrenic nerve, as it
was presumed that errors (such as were sought for) would affect the appa-
rent changes in any nerve under similar conditions of experiment to a
degree dependent upon the vascularity of the nerve and the maintenance

of its blood supply.

     Experimental means were obtained for the simultaneous record upon
same travelling surface of the movements both of a galvanometer and of
a blood-pressure manometer. In this way two curves were obtained, one
of electrical changes in tissue experimented upon and one of blood pressure
in general circulation, admitting of immediate contrast.

     The nerves chosen for experiment were :

     (a) The central end of divided vagus.
     (b) The peripheral end of divided vagus.
     (c) The recurrent laryngeal.

     In all these cases phenomena were found characteristic of each indi-
vidual nerve and irrespective of state of blood pressure, which will be

elsewhere described.

     But in addition indications were obtained and records taken of a rela-
tion sometimes existing between change of blood pressure and change of
demarcation current in nerve, a fall of pressure being accompanied by a
fall of current, and a succeeding rise of pressure by an increase in current.

     In such cases the parallelism of curves when obtained is of a crude
description, the galvanometer record following the main trend of the blood-

pressure record, but not responding to the finer variations. It is also
thought that such parallel curves are best obtained at the end of an

experiment, when the nerve has presumably suffered from exposure.

   A somewhat similar comparison ' has been made previously by other

observers in the case of spinal nerves, in which the demarcation current
was noticed as dependent upon the condition of animal.

   A very remarkable variation from such observations was, however,

several times obtained from the peripheral end of divided vagus, in which
the relation between the curves was inverted ; a rise of blood pressure
being accompanied by a negative variation in demarcation current, a fall
with an increase. There is also a marked difference in the nature of cor-
respondence between the two curves from that previously related, in this

case much more exact, finer changes being responded to and with a con-

stant latency.

     The possible presence of a double relation of demarcation current in
the peripheral end of vagus to changes of blood pressure, one in the oppo-
site direction to the other, was naturally the cause of a multiplicity of
experiments made upon this stretch of nerve. It might be remarked that
whilst the first type of change is analogous to that so far found in other
nerves, this second is peculiar to the nerve in question ; and although
admitting of a simple explanation by the behaviour of electromotive
changes in the walls of blood-vessels contained in it, is not (for reasons to
be elsewhere advanced) thought to be so caused.

     In continuation of general research an attempt was made to differen-
tiate between the secondary results of an altered circulation in uerve and

                              ' Gotch and Horsley, Croonian Lectures, 1891.
        ON ELECTKICAL CHANGES.                 601

the direct effects produced by changes ia the blood-vessels contained

in it.

For this pui'pose direct experiments of a similar kind were carried out

Anupon large blood-vessels.  artery was ligatured and divided, the cen-

tral end (towards the heart) dissected from its surroundings, raised in air,
and connected with galvanometer in same manner as nerves had been
connected. The stretching was found of importance, and the femoral

artery first chosen was abandoned for the carotid, as free from branches

and, therefore, from local injuries during dissection.
     In such a preparation current changes are found proportional to

changes of blood pressure of a gross kind and with a marked latency.

The relation between two is of same kind as that found in the peripheral
end of vagus nerve, a rise of pressure causing a fall of current. Such
current changes are not due to alterations in resistance of tissue to any

current found there, as their nature remains unaffected by the compensa-
tion or over- balancing of the demarcation current, retaining always the

same direction whatever the direction of current traversing tissue may be.
    As to the real source of such changes no positive statement can be

made. The most probable cause would seem to be an alteration in tonus

of muscular coat secondary to the change of pressure within vessel. This
is supported by the result of one experiment, in which an otherwise unin-
jured carotid artery was separated from surrounding tissues by a thin

sheet of indiarubber and a portion of its length connected with the

galvanometer. The galvanometric curve bore at first no relation to the
blood-pressure curve, but a relation was imperfectly introduced by injury

to artery at electrode distal from heart. In other experiments attempts

were also made to introduce electrodes into blood stream, but experiments
were lost owing to coagulation of blood and the eff"ects of pressure upon

electrodes themselves. It is, however, felt that without further evidence

an attempt to fix source of origin is futile.

     It was thought that the general research might be assisted by a study
of such changes as might be obtained under similar conditions from largest
combination of nerve and artery to be obtained in body. Experiments
were performed, in which the vagus and carotid, having been divided and
ligatured at same place, were lifted up without being separated from one
another. The piece of tissue so formed was stretched to its normal length,
and its distal end connected to galvanometer in usual way.

    From this preparation it was found possible to obtain, with unfailing
regularity, a galvanometer curve having the most marked correspondence

to simultaneous blood-pressure curve, a rise of pressure being accompanied
by a negative variation of current.

     It is to be noticed that the demarcation current obtained from this
tissue was exceedingly small, and that the variations in it were of a
magnitude bearing an extremely large ratio to it ; in fact the most suc-

cessful comparisons were made in preparations in which the original current
was practically nil. It is also of note that the quantity of change ob-

tained from this preparation in response to a change of blood pressure is

greater than that obtainable from carotid artery alone, and much greater

than that obtainable from vagus nerve alone.
     In the total result it seems possible that a contribution is due to

artery, a portion to nerve, and that in this case the components have
same direction ; for ligature of nerve near to trunk and as far as possible

 from electrodes produced a diminution in the steepness of curve, and
 it is believed an alteration of its character.

      The value of this latter observation is enhanced by the manner in
 which other changes unrelated to changes of blood pressure, but known
 from further research to occur in nerve during conditions of experiment,
 are swamped by the superposition of artery, it being presumed that value

 of derived circuit through galvanometer is rendered comparatively negli-
 gible by its relatively large resistance.

     In cases of all previous part of research it may be said that the phy-

 siological continuity of tissue examined is essential.

     Summing up, it may be said that all the experiments upon which

 statements have been based were carried out under the conditions of
 original experiments upon phrenic nerves ; that is, that the experimental
 n:ethod used for obtaining the alterations of blood pressure ' consisted of
 curarisation, artificial respiration, and intervals of its suspension.

      This, though not a good method for the unravelling of secondary
 problems which have presented themselves, allows one to translate all the
occurrences which have been found in other nerves and tissues to a pro-
bable occurrence during any one of phrenic experiments. The main results

may be tabulated as follows :

      (1) Current changes have been found in divided nerves directly pro-
portional to changes of pressure, the relation between the two being
however, as to time and quantity of a gross kind.

      (2) Current changes have been found in peripheral end of divided
vagus nerve inversely proportional to changes of blood pressure, in which

relation is much more exact.
     (3) The latter class of changes has not been obtained from any other

nerve examined
                                                             ;
      (4) but is constantly to be obtained from the divided carotid artery,

though here less exact
      (5) and with great exactness and magnitude from vagus carotid pre-

paration.

      (6) That this latter result is diminished by ligature of vagus below
point examined.

     Having thus obtained information of events met with in other tissues,
nerves, and blood-vessels, situated in near neighbourhood and obtaining
their blood supply from very similar sources, experiments were resumed
upon phrenic itself.

     Simultaneous curves of electrical changes in phrenic and of general
blood pressure show no correspondence of a kind to explain the charac-
teristic phenomena obtained in phrenic nerve alone of all the nerves
examined, and the large alterations of blood pressure which occur in every
experiment cannot be even definitely said to constantly afiect the base line

of phrenic tracing.

     To make the result more conclusive, simultaneous records were

taken both of current changes in phrenic and in vagus carotid preparation,

which latter is known to repeat all the incidents of a blood-pressure

curve.

     The tracings obtained show the typical appearances of either curve, of
quite diverse types, showing no relation of the kind sought for. Oscilla-

tlons ill one curve are unaccompanied by oscillations in the other, with an
exception of no moment from point of view of question at issue.

     It is worth statino; that, as two galvanometers of same pattern but of
diflferent internal resistance were used in the latter class of experiment,
care was taken to change the instrument connected to either tissue during

tlie course of experiment. This, however, may be looked at as of con-
siderable advantage, and serves to make result obtained more conclusive.

    Tlie final statement may be therefore made with positive conviction :

' That the phenomena obtained in phrenic nerves are independent of,
in the sense of being in no way due to, local changes of blood pressure or
of circulation ; neither in so far as such conditions affect the nerve nor

the blood-vessels contained in it.'
      This does not affirm the absence of circumstances analogous to those

obtained elsewhere, but places them, when present, in a position of very

minor importance.

--The ComjMrative Histolocjij of the Cerebral Cortex. Report of the

Work upon this subject has been carried on or initiated during the year

by Dr. G. Mann in the Physiological Laboratory, Oxford ; details are

given in the subjoined report.

The brains (including the retinre) of five specimens of Macaque monkey

have been utilised for this inquiry. The material was fixed for histological

purposes in one of the following fixatives : (a) picro-corrosive formal-

glacial acetic acid, acetate of copper, and formol. All solutions were

injected into the animal as soon after death as practicable under normal

pressure. The Weigert methods did not yield good results, although slices

of the cerebral tissue, 5 mm. thick, were left for five days in the solutions
at body temperature. On embedding in paraffin and cutting sections, the

blocks were found to be over-hardened on the surface, whilst the interior

was insufficiently fixed. One of the specimens fixed in picro-corrosive was

Aunsatisfactory, as the tissue showed extensive waxy degeneration.

second specimen fixed in the same way appears to give most satisfactory

results as far as the examination of the sections has at present extended.

Serial sections have been made of the olfactory bulb, the olfactory lobe, the

hippocampal region, the occipital lobe and the retinse, the motor regions of

the trunk and hind limb muscles ; sections of the motor regions of the upper

limbs, head, «fec., have not yet been made. As regards the examination of

the olfactory bulb and the fascia dentata, it is of interest that the granules

present in these regions, if stained by the toluidine-blue and eosin method,

show Nissl's substance, and thus appear to be true nerve-cells.

The examination of the retinte has brought out several points of

interest. Sections in the horizontal plane, through the optic disc, and the

macula lutea, show that the structure of the retinas in the Macaque appa-

rently differs from that of human retina; as described by Schafer and

Golding-Bird. The macula lies 2"75 mm. from the centre of the optic

disc ; the outer rim of the cup measures ^ mm., the inner more depressed

part of the cup ] mm. The dipping inwards of the external limiting
membrane causes a circumferential cup around the inner one. The inner
and outer ganglionic layers, as well as the inner fibrous layer, are reduced

to very small proportions, there being in a section 10 /j thick only 15
nuclei of the outer ganglionic layer scattered along the margin of the

macula. The thickness of the layer of the nuclei of the rods and cones
(outer nuclear) is greater when measured from within outwards in the
part opposite the macula than in any other region of the retina (55 /j) ;
this is largely due to the loose arrangement of the cone nuclei. The most
interesting point is the peculiar arrangement of the rods and cones.
Opposite the macula the cones are erect, i.e. their inner, middle, and outer
segments are all in a straight line ; outside the macula, howevex", the outer
segments of both rods and cones all point towards the centre of the
macula, the angle which these segments make with the middle ones
depending upon the distance of the elements from the yellow spot. The
different segments of the cones are of the same length, whether the part
examined is within or outside the macula ; there is thus no evidence of
the shortening of the inner and middle cone segments which is present in
the macula region of the human retina.

     The transverse dimension of a cone increases steadily in proportion to
the distance of the region examined from the macula. The large extent
of the increase on the temporal side is shown in the following table :

--The Physiological Effects of Peptone and its Precursors ivhen introduced
       into the Circulation. Thirdj Interim Report of a Committee, con-
      sisting of Professor E. A. Schafer, F.B.S. (Chairman), Professor
     C. S. Sherrington, F.B.S. , Professor K. W. Boyce, arid Professor
     W. H. Thompson (Secretary). (Drawn %ip by the Secretary.)

In pursuing this research during the past year, work has in the first
instance been directed towards the completion of the different portions of
the enquiry already in hand. In several of the sections this has been
achieved, and the results have been published in exienso in the 'Journal

of Physiology ' for the current year.

     The following is a brief rt^suvie of the chief conclusions arrived at, as
given in the above articles.

   --The substances employed were Purified amphopeptone, antipeptone,

deuteroproteose, protoproteose, heteroproteose, and, in certain cases,
Witte's 'peptone.'

                        Section T. Influence on Blood Coagulation.

     (a) With purified amphopeptone only a retarding effect was observed.
The doses employed varied from 0-005 grammes to 0"2 grammes per kilo

of body weight.
     (6) With antipeptone only a hastening effect was yielded by doses

up to 0'3 grammes per kilo.
     (c) With each of the primary and secondary proteoses both phases of

coagulation effect were observed. In all, coagulation was hastened in eight

experiments, retarded in seventeen experimeiits.

                         Section II. Infltoence on Blood Pressure.

      (a) All of the substances employed, with the exception of antipeptone,
possess undoubted vaso-dilating properties.

     (6) The effect in question belongs to these substances in different

degrees, the products taking their places in increasing order of potency,
as follows : amphopeptone, deuteroproteose, heteroproteose, protoproteose.

     (c) Antipeptone possesses practically no immediate lowering influence
on the tonus of blood-vessels, or at most an effect so transient that it is
doubtful if it should not be attributed to adhering impurity.

                         Section III. Influence on Vaso-Mobility.

     (a) The vaso-dilating influence shown by the bodies under examina-
tion, in agreement with that caused by Witte's ' peptone,' is brought about
by a peripheral effect on the vessel walls, causing a reduction or tempo-

rary suppression of vaso-mobility.

     (6) Amphopeptone and deuteroproteose, while differing little from each
other, manifest far less effect in this respect than do the primary pro-
teoses. The latter exert this influence to a profound degree.

     (c) Of the primary bodies, protoproteose is probably the more potent,
though not to a wide extent. Heteroproteose, indeed, almost equals in

influence its fellow body.

     (d) The effect of Witte's 'peptone' mvist therefore be mainly ascribed
to its protoproteose constituents. This body ordinarily forms a much
larger ingredient of the substance in question than does heteroproteose.
 GOG REPORT-- 1899.

       (e) Antipeptone possesses no power of depressing vaso-mobility con-
 sistently with its lack of influence in lowering blood-pressure.

                             Section IV. Local Vascular Influences.

       In this section, in addition to completing the observations on the
 limb, kidney, and spleen districts, the research was extended during the
 year so as to include the vessels of two other regions, namely, those of the

 intestine and liver. The following is a brief summary of the results as a

 whole.

                                                          1. Intestinal Vessels.

      (a) Direct observation and record verify the inference that dilatation
 of the intestinal vessels accompanies and must to a certain extent account
 for the fall of blood-pressure produced by injection of Witte's ' peptone '
 and similar products into the vascular system.

      (6) It also establishes beyond doubt that the dilatation of intestinal
 vessels is produced by peripheral depression, or even temporary abolition

 of vaso-mobility, in the area in question.

      (c) That the order of potency in regard to effect on intestinal vessels
 corresponds with that above given for the splanchnic area in general;

the primary proteoses exerting much the most profound influence, that of
 deuteroproteose and purified peptonebeing comparatively small.

                                                 2. Senal Vessels.

      (a) The blood-vessels of the kidney do not share in the dilatation

brought about by these substances. On the contrary, the vessels of this
organ are much less distended under their influence than under ordinary

circumstances.

     (6) Vaso-mobility in the renal area is much less profoundly influenced

than in the intestinal district.

     (e) Bearing in mind the statement made in the foregoing paragraph,
the primary proteoses are also the most effective on I'enal vessels. Indeed,
they may be said to be the only members of the group which appreciably

reduce renal vaso-mobility.

                                                           3. Splenic Vessels.

     (a) The vessels of this district share to a moderate extent in the dila-
tation which follows an injection of ' peptone ' or of one of the proteoses.

      (b) Vaso-mobility is also diminished iir the splenic district, but to a
less degree than in the intestinal. In this respect the vessels of the
spleen take a position intermediate between those of the kidney and the

intestine.

     (c) Proto- and hetei'oproteose are here also the most effective of the
substances examined. Deuteroproteose and purified peptone have com-

paratively little influence.

                                                       4. Liver Vessels.

     (a) The vessels of this district suffer an enormous dilatation under the
influence of ' peptone ' and proteoses, corresponding to the period of

general fall of blood-pressure.

     {h) This dilatation is primarily due to an increased onflow of blood
from the vessels of the portal system, and not to mere stoppage from sup-
posed weakening of the heart.

     (c) Under conditions of great fall of blood-pressure resulting from
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF PEPTONE.                                607'

vascular dilatation in the splanchnic region, tiie chief accumulation of
blood seems to take place in the liver, exceeding even that in the vessels
of the intestine.

     (d) The vessels of this district, owing to their easy dilatability, pro-
bably play the part of a safety receptacle to the heart, thereby guarding
it against over-influx of blood under conditions of great dilatation in the

splanchnic vascular territory.

     {'') The substances examined produce a great depression of vaso-
mobility in the liver district, the vessels of this organ thus showing a

high degree of susceptibility to the influence of the bodies here employed.

     (/) The different substances show the same order of potency in their
influence on the liver district as is manifested by them elsewhere.

                                                5. Limb Vessels.

     (a) Some influence is undoubtedly exerted on limb vessels by the pro-

ducts here dealt with, but this influence is very slight, less even than in
the case of renal vessels.

     (b) Little or no dilatation is experienced by these vessels during the

period of fall of general blood-pressui-e.
     (c) Here, also, the influence of the primary proteoses is greater than

that of the other bodies examined. Indeed, the former may be said to be
the only members of the group which possess any influence on limb

vessels.

    From the foregoing local vascular manifestations, the following con-
clusions of a more general nature may be deduced :

     1. That the blood-vessels of different vascular districts show diSerent
degrees of susceptibility to ' peptone ' influence, and play unequal parts in
producing the general results which follow an injection of peptone or

proteoses.

     2. The vessels of the splenic, intestinal, and hepatic districts constitute
a group eminently sensitive to ' peptone ' influence, while those of the
kidney and limbs are eminently insensitive in this respect.

     3. Amongst the vessels of the first group, those of the splenic district
are least susceptible, those of the liver most so, while those of the intes-

tine occupy an intermediate position.

Section V. Effects on Urinary Secretion.

Work in this section was also brought to a temporary completion, and

Anfurnished interesting and important deductions.  article dealing with

these will shortly be published. The results attained invite further inves-

tigation, which it is intended to take in hand during the coming year.

Part of the work of completion just alluded to involved the perform-

ance of a series of control experiments to determine the influence which

the anaesthetic employed might exert on the secretion of urine. These

showed that the peptone effects were in no wise modified by the influence

of the aDcBsthetic.

                    Section VI. Effects of Antipeptone-consliluents.

    It has recently been shown that antipeptone is composed of a number
of difterent bodies, the chief amongst these being Arginin, Histidin, and
Lysin. It was therefore deemed advisable to extend the research into an

examination of the physiological effects produced by these substances when

introduced into the circulation. This was carried into effect with the kind

permission of Professor A. Kossel, in the Physiological Institute of Mar-

Aburg University.    preliminary communication dealing with the results,

so far as obtained, will, it is hoped, be made to Section I. at the forth-

coming Meeting.

--The Influence of Brurjs upon the Vascular Nervous System. Report of

     the Committee, consisting of Professor F. GoTCH (Ghairmcon),

    Professor Halliburton (Secretary), and Dr. F. W. Mott.

The physiological action of choline and neurine has been investigated by

Dr. F. W. Mott, M.D., F.R.S., and Professor Halliburton ; the results

of their experiments are embodied in the subjoined third report.

In the two reports which precede this, we have shown that cerebro-

spinal Huid from cases of general paralysis of the insane contains choline,

and that the fall of arterial blood-pressure that takes jslace when the

fluid is injected into animals is due to this substance. This base is absent

from normal cerebro-spinal fluid, and is doubtless, in the pathological

fluid, derived from the disintegration of lecithin in the cerebral tissue.

The proof that the base is choline rests partly on its chemical identi6ca-

tion in the lluid, and partly on the identical action which the fluid has

with weak solutions (0'2 per cent.) of choline or choline hydi'ochloride.

The closely related and much more toxic base, neurine, is absent.

In the case of choline, the fall of blood-pressure is partly cardiac and

partly produced by vascular dilatation, especially in the intestinal area.

Contrary to expectation the spleen does not participate in this dilatation,

but is constricted ; this constriction is followed by an increase of the
normal splenic waves. It seems probable that the material in extracts

of brain which Schiifer and Moore found to produce the same ett'ect is

choline. Neurine produces a much more intense constriction of the

spleen, but no exaggeration of the splenic waves follows. The action of

the base on the intestinal blood vessels is due to its action on the neuro-

muscular mechanism of the blood vessels themselves. This was demon-

strated by locally bathing the mesenteric vessels with solutions of choline
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and by the fact that choline still continues to produce the usual fall of

arterial pressure, (1) after the spinal cord has been divided high up,

(2) after the splanchnic nerves have been cut, and (3) after the animal

has been poisoned with  nicotine                                                the last  method excludes  any action of
                                                                             ;

peripheral ganglia.

Neurine produces a fall of blood-pressure, chiefly due to its action on

the heart ; this is followed by a rise of pressui'e, due to constriction of

peripheral vessels. Using the same methods as in the investigation of

choline, this is not an action on the central nervous system. The con-

striction of the vessels is, however, probably due to the action of the base

on the peripheral ganglia, for after nicotine poisoning it docs not occur.

The animals used have been dogs, cats, and rabbits. These were

always aniesthetised with ether, chloroform, or A. C. E. mixture ; in some
cases they also had a subcutaneous iiijcctioi\ of morphine. If, however,

a small amount of atropine is mixed witli the morphine, the effect of

choline is always a rise of blood pressure ; the lever of the intestinal
oncometer also rises.

--The Micro-chemistry of Cells. Interim Report of the Committee, con-

     sisting of Professor E. A. Schafer (Ghairman), Professor E.

    Eay Lankester, Professor W. D. Halliburton, Mr. Gr. C.

    Bourne, and Professor A. B. Macallum (Secretwrij).

The Committee beg to present an interim report.

     The investigation was directed along the following lines :

(1) The detection and localisation of iodine in animal cells and organs.

In regard to the detection of this element considerable difficulty was

experienced in finding a suitable reaction ; for starch, the usual test for

iodine, being a colloid when in solution, cannot penetrate iodine-holding

colloid tissue-material. Another difficulty consisted in the firmness with

which organic compounds of iodine hold the element in ' masked ' com-

bination. Both difficulties wei'e overcome by the discovery that solutions

of hydrochloric acid and mercuric chloride, under certain conditions, not

only set the iodine free in an inorganic form but yield it also as red mercuric

iodide. By this method it has been found that the iodine compound of

the thyroid gland is confined to its colloid masses, the gland cells beinw

free from traces even of the element. The ' colloid ' masses of the pitui-
tary body gave no evidence of the presence of iodine, nor was any trace of

it found in the other organs. Experiments in this line are being made on

the tissues of certain invertebrates.

(2) The micro-chemical localisation of sulphur of inorganic and organic

combinations in animal cells. The reaction employed is that obtained
when a mixture of solutions of lead acetate and potassic hydrate with

glycerine, in such proportions as to yield a clear solution, is allowed to

act on tissue material which has been hardened for a long time in alcohol.

Inorganic sulphur combinations yield the result at once, while the lightly

bound organic sulphur gives tlie brown colour of lead sulphide on the

application of heat. The reaction has been found useful in determinin"-

some points of importance, as for example the proteid character of a
number of structures in the protozoa and protophyta, and the presence of

sulphur in the chromosomes of the nucleus in the dividing cell, a fact
which indicates that these bodies, contrary to the view of some cytologists,

are not constituted of pure nucleic acid but rather of a nucleo-proteid.

     (3) Observations on the distribution of organic phosphorus, in the case
of compounds digestible in artificial gastric juice. These demonstrated

that the soluble compounds are much more abundant than the insoluble

ones (i.e. nucleins or chromatins) in the cells of the liver, thyroid,

suprarenals, and pituitary gland. In the latter organ the soluble com-

pounds are specially abundant, and they appear to constitute also a con-

siderable portion of the colloid material of this organ.

(4) The action of different mineral reagents on cellular structures

hardened in alcohol, under high pressures (8-12 atmospheres), and at

temperatures between 100° C. and 200° C. This line of work has been

followed for less than two months, and consequently the results an; incom-

plete, but they are of interest when taken in connection with the results

of artificial digestion. It is proposed to compare these results with those

obtained by treating in a similar way the cell juices extracted from fresh

cells by hydraulic pressure.

(5) The elaboration of atom-group reactions of proteids for micro-

chemical purposes. Those which have proved to be the most useful are

ONthe oxyphenyl (ty rosin) reaction, the  (biuret) reaction, and that

resulting from the action of slowly concentrating sulphuric and hydro-

chloric acids, discovered by Elliott, and apparently due to the indol atom-
group. It has been found that the Reichl reactions, which are supposed

to indicate the presence of either indol or skatol in proteids, are without

value in micro-chemical application, and the same may be said of Krasser's

reaction with alloxan, which is held to postulate the occurrence of

CH2"CH(NH2)'COOH in the proteid molecule. The atom-group

reactions are being employed to study the characters of the nuclear com-

pounds in different cells.

     Owing to the extent of the investigation undertaken, more time is
required, and the Committee ask to be reappointed.

    Prof. J. B. Farmer {Chairman), Prof. R. W. Phillips (Secretari/),

     Prof. F. 0. Bower, and Prof. Harvey Gibson. {Brawn up by the

       Secretary.)

The grant made last year for the furtherance of the study of the processes
of fertilisation among Phseophycefe was 20^., and your Committee decided
to devote again the whole amount as an aid to Mr. J. Lloyd Williams in

his researches.

     The following are some of the questions to which Mr. Williams has
been giving his attention during the past year :

1. Dictyota dichotoma. The cytology of the sexual cells of the fertilised

egg, and of the parthenogenetic stages of the unfertilised egg, has been

fully worked out, and the results are now ready for publication.
     2. Halidrys siliquosa and Ilimanthalia lorea. The life-history and

cytology of these plants have been further investigated. Mr. Williams

proposes to submit a paper on the former plant for the consideration of

the Section at Dover.

     3. Laminar'ia saccharina and Alaria esculenta. Mr. Williams has
submitted the zoospores of these species to experiment, and has made

some interesting observations on their germination.
A4. Fucacece.
                  joint paper by Professor Farmer and Mr. Williams

on the natural history of several species of Fucaceae is in course of

preparation.

5. Fucus hybrids. Mr. Williams has communicated to the 'Annals of

Botany ' (vol xiii.. No. 49) a short note giving the results of observations

on this subject.

     The Committee consider that these investigations are likely to yield
more interesting results when they are carried still further, and they
would urge the renewal of the grant for another year.

The Committee beg to report that they have expended two-thirds of the
20^. placed at their disposal, and they request that they may be re-

appointed with a view to the expenditure of the balance.
     The grant has been mainly devoted to aiding Mr. Blackman in the

construction of an expensive apparatus for the investigation of assimi-

lation, which is now complete ; and it is proposed to allot to him the
remainder of the sum for the continuation of his researches. These have

been in progress for some time ; they deal with the sources of the carbon
dioxide of leaf assimilation ; with the respiration of the stem as dis-
tinguished from the leaf ; with the magnitude of the absorption of carbon
dioxide from the soil ; and with kindred problems, of which a preliminary

account was given by Mr. Blackman at the Bristol meeting. The many
ways in which these various factors interact on one another make it

desirable not to publish the detailed investigations of one before those of
the others are completed. It is expected, however, that the results will
be ready for publication in the course of the coming year.

 SECTION A.--MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE.

   --President of the Section. Professor J. H. Potnting, D.Sc, F.Pi.S.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

     The President delivered the following Address :

The members of this Section will, I am sure, desire me to give expression to the
gratification that we all feel in the realisation of the scheme first proposed from

this chair by Dr. Lodge, the scheme for the establishment of a National Physical
Laboratory. It would be useless here to attempt to point out the importance of

the step taken in the definite foundation of the Laboratory, for we all recognise that

it was absolutely necessary for the due progress of physical research in this country.
It is matter for congratulation that the initial guidance of the work of the
Laboratory has been placed in such able hands.

     While the investigation of Nature is ever increasing our knowledge, and while
each new discovery is a positive addition never again to be lost, the range of the
investigation and the nature of the knowledge gained form the theme of endless

discussion. And in this discussion, so different are the views of different schools

of thought, that it might appear hopeless to look for general agreement, or to
attempt to mark progress.

     Nevertheless, I believe that in some directions there has been real progress, and
that phj'sicists, at least, are tending towards a general agreement as to the
nature of the laws in which they embody their discoveries, of the explanations
which they seek to give, and of the hypotheses they make in their search for

explanations.

     I propose to ask you to consider the terms of this agreement, and the form
in which, as it appears to me, they should be drawn up.

     The range of the physicist's study consists in the visible motions and other
sensible changes of matter. The experiences with which he deals are the impres-
sions on his senses, and his aim is to describe in the shortest possible way how his
various senses have been, will be, or would be affected.

      His method consists in finding out all likenesses, in classing together all similar
events, and so giving an account as concise as possible of the motions and changes
observed. His success in the search for likenesses and his striving after concise-
ness of description lead him to imagine such a constitution of things that like-
nesses exist even where they elude his observation, and he is thus enabled to
simplify his classification on the assumption that the constitution thus imagined is

a reality. He is enabled to predict on the assumption that the likenesses of the

future will be the likenesses of the past.
      His account of Nature, then, is, as it is often termed, a descriptive account.

     Were there no similarities in events, our account of them could not rise
616 REPORT-- 1899.

above a mere dii'ectory, with each individual event entered up separately with its
address. But the similarities observed enable us to class large numbers of events
together, to give general descriptions, and indeed to make, instead of a directory,
a readable book of science, ynih laws as the headings of the chapters.

     These laws are, I believe, in all cases brief descriptions of observed similarities.

By way of illustration let us take two or three examples.
    The law of gravitation states that to each portion of matter we can assign a

-- --constant its mass such that there is an acceleration towards it of other mattt^r

proportional to that mass divided by the square of its distance awa}'. Or all
bodies resemble each other in having this acceleration towards each other.

     Hooke's law for the case of a stretched wire states that each successive equal
small load produces an equal stretch, or states that the behaviour of the wire is

similar for all equal small pulls.

     Joule's law for the heat appearing when a current flows in a wire states that

the rate of heat development is proportional to the square of the current multiplied

by the resistance, or states that all the diti'erent cases resemble each other in
having H-^C'-R^ constant.

     And, generally, when a law is expressed by an equation, that equation is a
statement that two different sets of measurements are made, represented by the
terms on the two sides of the equation, and that all the different cases resemble
each other in that the two sets have the constant relation expressed by the
equation. Accurate prediction is based on the assumption that when we have
made the measurements on the one side of the equation we can tell the result of

the measurements implied on the other side.

     If this is a true account of the nature of physical laws, they have, we must
confess, greatly fallen off' in dignity. No long time ago they were quite commonly
described as the Fixed Laws of Nature, and were supposed sufficient in themselves

to govern the universe. Now we can only assign to them the humble rank of

mere descriptions, often tentative, often erroneous, of similarities which we believe
we have observed.

     The old conception of laws as self-sufficing governors of Nature was, no doubt,
a survival of a much older conception of the scope of physical science, a mode of
regarding physical phenomena which had itself passed away.

     I imagine that originally man looked on himself and the result of his action in

the motions and changes which he produced in matter, as the one type in terms of
which he should seek to describe all motions and changes. Knowing that his
purpose and will were followed by motions and changes in the matter about him,
he thought of similar purpose and will behind all the motions and changes which
he observed, however they occurred ; and he believed, too, that it was necessary to
think thus in giving any consistent account of his observations. Taking this

-- --anthropomorphic or, shall we say, psychical view, the laws he formulated were

not merely descriptions of similarities of behaviour, but they were also expressions

of fixed purpose and the resulting constancy of action. They were commands given
to matter which it must obey.

     The psychical method, the introduction of purpose and will, is still appropriate
when we are concerned with living beings. Indeed, it is the only method which
we attempt to follow when we are describing the motions of our fellow-

creatures. No one seeks to describe the motions and actions of himself and of his

fellow-men, and to classify them without any reference to the similarity of purpose
when the actions are similar. But as the study of Nature progressed, it was found
to be quite futile to bring in the ideas of purpose and will when merely describing
and classifying the motions and changes of non-living matter. Purpose and will
could be entirely left out of sight, and yet the observed motions and changes could
be described, and predictions could be made as to future motions and changes.
Limiting the aim of physical science to such description and prediction, it gradually
became clear that the method was adequate for the purpose, and over the range of
non-living matter, at least, the psychical yielded to the physical. Laws ceased
to be commands analogous to legal enactments, and became mere descriptions. But
during the passage from one position to the other, by a confusion of thought which
          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                             617

may appear strange to us uow that wo have finished the journey, though no doubt

it was inevitable, the purpose and will of which the laws had been the expression

were put into the laws themselves; they were personified and made to will

and act.

Even now these early stages in the history of thought can be traced by

survivals in our language, survivals due to the ascription of moral qualities to

matter. Thus gases are still sometimes said to obey or to disobey Boyle's Law as if

it were an enactment for their guidance, and as if it set forth an ideal, the perfect

gas, for their inutalion. ^^'e still hear language which seems to imply that real

gases are wanting in perfection, in that they fail to observe the exact letter of the

Jaw. I suppose on this view we should have to sa)' that hydrogen is nearest 1o
perfection ; but then we should have to regard it as righteous overmuch, a sort of
Pharisee among gases which overshoots the mark in its endeavour to obey the law.
Oxygen and nitrogen we may regard as good enough in the afi'airs of everyday

life. But carbon dioxide and chlorine and the lilse are poor sinners which yield

to temptation and liquefy whenever circumstances press at all hardly on them.

There is a similar ascription of moral qualities when we judge bodies accord-

ing to their fulfilment of the purpose for which we use them, when we describe

them as good or bad radiators, good or bad insulators, as if it were a duty on their

part to radiate well, or insulate well, and as if there were failures on the part of

Nature to come up to the proper standard.

These are of course mere trivialities, but the reaction of language on thought

is so subtle and far-reaching that, risking the accusation of pedantry, I would

urge the abolition of all such picturesque terms. In our quantitative estimates let

us be content with ' high ' or ' low,' ' great ' or ' small,' and let us remember that

Athere is no such thing as a failure to obey a physical law.     broken law is

merely a false description.

Concurrently with the change in our conception of physical law has come a

Wechange in our conception of physical explanation.  have not to go very far
--back to find such a statement as this that we have explained anything when we
--know the cause of it, or when we have found out the reason why a statement

which is only appropriate on the psychical view. AVithout entering into any dis-

cussion of the meaning of cause, we can at least assert that that meaning will only
have true content when it is concerned with purpose and will. On the purely

physical or descriptive view, the idea of cause is quite out of place. In descrip-

tion we are solelj' concerned with the ' how ' of things, and their ' why ' we pur-
Weposely leave out of account.
                                explain an event not when we know ' why ' it

happened, but when we show ' how ' it is like something else happening elsewhere

--or otherwhen when, in fact, we can include it as a case described by some law

already set forth. In explanation, we do not account for the event, but we im-

prove our account of it by likening it to what we already knew.

For instance, Newton explained the falling of a stone when he showed that

its acceleration towards the earth was similar to and could be expressed by the
same law as the acceleration of the moon towards the earth.

    He explained the air disturbance we call ' sound ' when he showed that the

motions and forces in the pressure waves were like motions and forces already

studied.

    Franklin explained lightning when and so far as he showed that it was similar

in its behaviour to other electric discharges.

    Here I do not fear any accusation of pedantry in joining those who urge that
we should adapt our language to the modern view. It would be a very real gain,

a great assistance to clear thinking, if we could entirely abolish the word ' cause '

in physical description, cease to say ' why ' things happen unless we wish to

signify an antecedent purpose, and be content to own that our laws are but
expressions of ' how ' they occur.

     The aim of explanation, then, is to reduce the number of laws as far as possible,
by showing that laws, at first separated, may be merged in one ; to reduce the number
of chapters in the book of science by showing that some are truly mere sub-sections

of chapters already wiitten.
618 REPORT-- 1899.

     To take an old but never-warn-out metaphor, tlie physicist is examiniiif^ the
garment of Nature, learning of how many, or rather of how few, different kinds of
thread it is woven, finding how each, separate thread enters into the pattern, and
seeking from the pattern woven in the past to know the pattern yet to come.

    How many ditferent kinds of thread does Nature use 1'

    So far, we have recognised some eight or nine, the number of different forms
of energy which we are still obliged to count as distinct. But this distinction we

cannot believe to be real. The relations between the different forms of energy,
and the fixed rate of exchange when one form gives place to another, encourage

us to suppose that if we could only sharpen our senses, or change our point of view,

Wewe could effect a still further reduction.  stand in front of Nature's loom as

we watch the weaving of the garment ; while we follow a particular thread in the

pattern it suddenly disappears, and a thread of another colour takes its place. Is

this a new thread, or is it merely the old thread turned round and presenting a new

We Weface to us ?
         can do little more than guess.       cannot get to the other side

of the pattern, and our minutest watching will not tell us all the working of the

loom.

Leaving the metaphor, were we true physicists, and physicists alone, we should,

I suppose, be content to describe merely what we observe in the changes of energy.

We should say, for instance, that so much kinetic energy ceases, and that so much

heat appears, or that so much light comes to a surface, and that so much chemical

energy takes its place. But we have to take ourselves as we are, and reckon with

the fact that though our material is physical, we ourselves are psychical. And, as a

Wemere matter of fact, we are not content with such discontinuous descriptions.

Wedislike the discontinuity and we think of an underlying identity.  think of the

heat as being that which a moment before was energy of visible motion, we think

of the light as changing its form alone and becoming itself the chemical energy.

Then to our passive dislike of discontinuity we join our active desire to form a
mental picture of what may be going on, a picture like something which we already

know. Coming on these discontinuities our ordinary method of explanation fails,

for they are not obviously like those series of events in which we can trace every

Westep.  then imagine a constitution of matter and modifications of it corre-

sponding to the diflerent kinds of energy, such that the discontinuities vanish, and

such that we can picture one form of energy passing into another and yet keeping

Wethe same in kind throughout.  are no longer content to describe what we

actually see or feel, but we describe what we imagine we should see or feel if our

Wesenses were on quite another scale of magnitude and sensibility.   cease to be

physicists of the real and become physicists of the ideal.

To form such mental pictures we naturally choose the sense which makes such

pictures most definite, the sense of sight, and think of a constitution of matter

which shall enable us to explain all the various changes in terms of visible motions

Weand accelerations.  imagine a mechanical constitution of the universe.

We are encouraged in this attempt by the fact that the relations in this mechanical

conception can be so exactly stated, that the equations of motion are so very

definite. AVe have, too, examples of mechanical systems, of which we can give

accounts far exceeding in accuracy the accounts of other physical systems. Com-
pare, for instance, the accuracy with which we can describe and foretell the path of

a planet with our ignorance of the movements of the atmosphere as dependent on
the heat of the sun. The planet keeps to the astronomer's time-table, but the

wind still bloweth almost where it listeth.

  --The only foundation which has yet been imagined for this mechanical explana-

tion if we may use ' exphinatiou ' to denote the likening of our imaginings to that

--which we actually observe is the atomic and molecular hypothesis of matter.

This hypothesis arose so early in the history of science that we are almost tempted

to suppose that it is a necessity of thought, and that it has a warrant of some

higher order than any other hypothesis which could be imagined. But I suspect
that if we could trace its early development we should find that it arose in an
attempt to explain the phenomena of expansion and contraction, evaporation and
solution. Were matter a continuum we should have to admit all these as simple
                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                       619

facts, inexplicable in that they are like nothiug else. But imagine matter to con-

sist of a crowd of separate particles with interspaces. Contraction and expansion

are then merely a drawing in and a widening out of the crowd. Solution is merely

the mingling of two crowds, and evaporation merely a dispersal from the outskirts.

The most evident properties of matter are then similar to what may be observed

in any public meeting.

For ages the molecular hypothesis hardly went further than this. The first

step onward was the ascription of vibratory motion to the atoms to explain heat.

Then definite qualities were ascribed, definite mutual forces were called into play

to explain elasticity and other properties or qualities of matter. But I imagine its
first really great achievement was its success in explaining the law of combining

proportions, and next to that we should put its success in explaining many of the

properties of gases.

  -- --While light was regarded as corpuscular in fact molecular and while direct

action at a distance presented no difficulty, the molecular hypothesis served as the

one foundation for the mechanical representation of phenomena. But when it was
shown that infinitely the best account of the phenomena of light could be given

on the supposition that it consisted of waves, something was needed, as Lord

Salisbury has said, to wave, both in the interstellar and in the intermolecular

spaces. So the hypothesis of an ether was developed, a necessary complement of

that form of the molecular hypothesis in which matter consists of discrete particles

with matter-free intervening spaces.

Then Faraday's discovery of the influence of the dielectric medium in electric

actions led to the general abandonment of the idea of action at a distance, and the

ether was called in to aid matter in the explanation of electric and magnetic

phenomena. The discovery that the velocity of electro-magnetic waves is the same

as that of light waves is at least circumstantial evidence that the same medium

transmits both.

    I suppose we all hope that some time we shall succeed in attributing to this
medium such further qualities that it will he able to enlarge its scope and take in
the work of gravitation.

The mechanical hypothesis has not always taken this dualistic form of material

atoms and molecules, floating in a quite distinct ether. I think we may regard

Boscovich's theory of point-centres surrounded by infinitely extending atmospheres

of force as really an attempt to get rid of the dualism, and Faraday's theory of

point-centres with radiating lines of force is only Boscovich's theory in another

form. But Lord Kelvin's vortex-atom theory gives us a simplification more easily

--thought of. Here all space is filled with continuous fluid shall we say a fluid
--ether ? and the atoms are mere loci of a particular type of motion of this frictionless

fluid. The sole differences in the atoms are differences of position and motion.

Where there are whirls, we call the fluid matter ; where there are no whirls, we call

it ether. All energy is energy of motion. Our visible kinetic energy, MV-/2, is

energy in and round the central whirls ; our visible energy of position, our potential

energy, is energy of motion in the outlying regions.

   A similar simplification is given by Dr. Larmor's hypothesis, in which, again, all

space is filled with continuous substance all of one kind, but this time solid rather
than fluid. The atoms are loci of strain instead of whirls, and the ether is that
which is strained.

Sp, as we watch the weaving of the garment of Nature, we resolve it iu

Weimagination into threads of ether spangled over with beads of matter.  look

still closer, and the beads of matter vanish ; they are mere knots and loops in the

threads of ether.

  --The question now faces us How are we to regard these hypotheses as to the

Howconstitution of matter and the connecting ether ?  are we to look upon the

explanations they aiford ? Are we to put atoms and ether on an equal footing

with the phenomena observed by our senses, as truths to be investigated for their

own sake ? Or are they mere tools in the search for truth, liable to be worn out or

superseded ?

That matter is grained in structure is hardly more than the expression of the
0:^0 REPORT-- 1899.

fact that in very tliin layers it ceases to behave as in thicker layers. But when
we pass on from this general statement and give definite form to the granules or

assume definite qualities to the intergranular cement we are deaHng with pure

hypotheses.

It is hardly possible to tliink that we shall ever see an atom or handle the
We Weether.
             make no attempt whatever to render them evident to the senses.

connect observed conditions and changes in gross visible matter by invisible mole-

cular and ethereal machinery. The changes at each end of the machinery of
which we seek to give an account are in gross matter, and this gross matter is our

only instrument of detection, and we never receive direct sense impressions of the

imagined atoms or the intervening ether. To a strictly descriptive physicist

their only use and interest would lie in their service in prediction of the chauges
which are to take place in gross matter.

     It appears quite possible that various types of machinery might be devised to

produce the known effects. The type we have adopted is undergoing constant
minor changes, as new discoveries suggest new arrangements of the parts. Is it

utterly beyond possibility that the type itself should change ?

    The special molecular and ethereal machinery which we have designed, and
which we now generally use, has been designed because our most highly developed
sense Is our sense of sight. Were we otherwise, had we a sense more delicate

than sight, one affording us material for more definite mental presentation, we

might quite possibly have constructed very dlfi'erent hypotheses. Though, as we

are, we cannot conceive any higher type than that founded on the sense of sight,

we can imagine a lower type, and by way of illustration of the point let us take
--mythe sense of which
                  predecessor spoke last year the sense of smell. In us it

is very undeveloped. But let us imagine a Ijeiug in whom it is highly cultivated,

say, a very intellectual and very hypothetical dog. Let us suppose that he tries

to frame an hypothesis as to light. Having found that his sense of smell is excited
by surface exhalations, will he not naturally make and be content with a corpus-

cular theory of light ? When he has discovered the facts of dispersion, will

--he not think of the difl'erent colours as different kiuds of smell insensible,

perhaps, to him, but sensible to a still more highly gifted, still more hypothetical

dog ?

Of course, with our superior intellect and sensibility, we can see where his

hypothesis would break down                                                                                                                                            but  unless we  are to                                                                                                              assume that we have reached
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

finality in sense development, the illustration, grotesque as it may be, will serve

to show that our hypotheses are in terms of ourselves rather than in terms of

Nature itself, they are ejective rather than objective, and so they are to be regarded

--as instruments, tools, apparatus only to aid us in the search for truth.
     To use an old analogy and here we- can hardly go except upon analogy-

while the building of Nature is growing spontaneously from within, the model of

it, which we seek to construct                                                                                                                                         in our  descriptive                                                                                                                 science,  can  only  be  constructed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        .

by means of scaffolding from without, a scaffolding of hypotheses. While in the

real building all is continuous, in our model there are detached parts which must

be connected with the rest by temporary ladders and passages, or which must be

supported till we can see how to fill in the understructure. To give the hypo-

theses equal validity with facts is to confuse the temporary scaffolding with the

building itself.

But even if we take this view of the temporary nature of our molecular and

ethereal imaginings, it does not lessen their value, their necessity to us.

    It is merely a true description of ourselves to say that we must believe in the
continuity of physical processes, and that we must attempt to form mental pictures

of those processes the details of which elude our observation. For such pictures

we must frame hypotheses, and we have to use the best material at command in

--framing them. At present there is only one fundamental hypothesis the mole-
--cular and ethereal hypothesis in some such form as is generally accepted.

    Even if we take the position that the form of the hypothesis may change as

--our knowledge extends, that we may be able to devise new machinery nay, even

that we may be able to design some quite new type to bring about the same
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                                     621

ends--that does not appear to me to lessen the present value of the hypothesis.

We can recognise to the full how well it enables us to group together large masses
of facts which, without it, would be scattered apart, how it serves to give

working explanations, and continually enables investigators to think out new

Wequestions for research.  can recognise that it is the symbolical form in which

Wemuch actual knowledge is cast.       might almost as well quarrel with the use of

the letters of the alphabet, inasmuch as they are not the sounds themselves, but

mere arbitrary symbols of the sounds.
     In this country there is no need for any defence of the use of the molecular

hypothesis. But abroad the movement from the position in which hypothesis is
confounded with observed truth has carried many through the position of equili-
brium equally far on the other side, and a party has been formed which totally
abstains from molecules as a protest against immoderate indulgence in their use.
Time will show whether these protesters can do without any hypothesis, whether

they can build without scaffolding or ladders. I fear that it is only an attempt to

build from balloons.
     But the protest will have value if it will put ns on our gua,rd against using

molecules and tbe ether everywhere and everywhen. There is, I think,^ some

danger that we may get so accustomed to picturing everything in terms of these
hypotheses that we may come to suppose that we have no firm basis for the facts
of observation until we have given a molecular account of them, that a molecular

basis is a firmer foundation than direct experience.

    Let me illustrate this kind of danger. The phenomena of capillarity can, for

the most part, be explained on the assumption of a liquid surface tension. But if

--the subject is treated merely from this point of view it stands alone it is a por-

tion of the building of science hanging in the air. The molecular hypothesis then

comes in to give some explanation of the surface tension, gives, as it were, a sup-
porting understructure connecting capillarity with other classes of phenomena.
But here, I think, the hypothesis should stop, and such phenomena as can be
explained by the surface tension should be so explained without reference to mole-
cules. They should not be brought in again till the surface-tension explamtion
fails. It is necessary to bear in mind what part is scafiblding, and what is the

building itself, already firm and complete.

Or, as another illustration, take the Second Law of Thermodynamics. I

suspect that it is sometimes supposed that a molecular theory from which the

Second Law could be deduced would be a better basis for it than the direct experi-

ence on which it was founded by Clausius and Kelvin, or that the mere imagining

of a Maxwell's sorting demon has already disproved   the  universality of the  law
                                                                                                  ;

whereas he is a mere hypothesis grafted on a hypothesis, and nothing correspond-

ing to his action has yet been found.

There is more serious danger of confusion of hypothesis with fact in the use of

the ether : more risk of failure to see what is accomplislied by its aid. In giving

an account of light, for instance, the right course, it appears to me, is to describe

the phenomena and lay down the laws under which they are grouped, leaving it

an open question what it is that waves, until the phenomena oblige us to introduce

something more than matter, until we see what properties we must assign to the

ether, properties not possessed by matter, in order that it may be competent to

Weafford the explanations we seek.     should then realise more clearly that it is

the constitution of matter which we have imagined, the hypothesis of discrete

particles, which obliges us to assume an intervening medium to carry on the

disturbance from particle to particle. But the vortex-atom hypothesis and Dr.

Larmor's strain-atom hypothesis both seem to indicate that we are moving in the
direction of the abolition of the distinction between matter and ether, that we

shall come to regard the luminiferous medium, not as an attenuated substance here

-- --and there encumbered with detached blocks the molecules of matter but as

something which in certain places exhibits modifications which we term matter.

Or starting rather from matter, we may come to think- of matter as no longer

consisting of separated granules, but as a continuum with properties grouped round

the centres, which we regard as atoms or molecules.
622 REPORT-- 1899.

     Perliaps I may illustrate the datiprer in the use of the conception of the ether
hy consideriiin; the common way of describing the electro-magnetic waves, which

are all about us here, as ether waves. Now iu all cases with which we are

 acquainted, these waves start from matter ; their energy before starting was, as far

as we can guess, energy of the matter between the diiferent parts of the source,
and they manifest themselves in the receiver as energy of matter. As they travel

 through the air, I believe that it is quite possible that the electric energy can be
 expressed in terms of the molecules of air in their path, that they are effecting

atomic separations as tbey go. If so, then the air is quite as much concerned in
their propagation as the ether between its molecules. In any case, to term them
ether waves is to prejudge the question before we have sufficient evidence.

     Unless we bear in mind the hypothetical character of our mechanical concep-

--tion of things, we may run some risk of another danger the danger of supposing

that we have something more real in mechanical than in other measurements.
For instance, there is some risk that the work measure of specific heat should be
regarded as more fundamental than the heat measure, in that heat is truly a ' mode
of motion.' On the molecular hypothesis, heat is no doubt a mixture of kinetic
energy and potential energy of the molecules and their constituents, and may even
be entirely kinetic energy ; and we may conceivably in the future make the
hypothesis so definite that, when we heat a gramme of water 1°, we can assign
such a fraction of an erg to each atom. But look how much pure hypothesis is
here. The real superiority of the work measure of .specific heat lies in the fact

that it is independent of any particular substance, and there is nothing whatever
hypothetical about it.^

      Another illustration of the illegitimate use of our hypothesis, as it appears to
me, is in the attempt to find in the ether a fixed datum for the measurement of

material velocities and accelerations, a something in which we can draw our co-

ordinate axes so that they will never turn or bend. But this is as if, discontented

with the movement of the earth's pole, we should seek to find our zero lines of

latitude and longitude in the Atlantic Ocean. Leaving out of sight the possibility

of ethereal currents which we cannot detect, and the motions due to every ray of light
which traverses space, we could only fix positions and directions in the ether by
buoying them with matter. AVe know nothing of the ether, except by its effects
on matter, and, after all, it would be the material buoys which would fix the

positions and not the ether in which they float.
     The discussion of the physical method, with its descriptive laws and explana-

tions, cindits hypothetical extension of description, leads us on to the consideration
of the limitation of its range. The method was developed in the study of matter

which we describe as non-living, and with non-living matter the method has sufficed
for the particular purposes of the physicist. Of course only a little corner of the
universe has been explored, but in the study of non-living matter we have come to
no impassable gulfs, no chasms across which we cannot throw bridges of
hypothesis. Does the method equally suffice when it is applied to living matter ?
Can we give a purely physical account of such matter, likening its motions and
changes to other motions and changes already observed, and so explaining them ?

     ' This risk of imagining one particular kind of measure more real than another,

more in accordance with the truth of things, may be further illustrated by the

common idea that mass-acceleration is the only way to measure a force. We stand

apart from our mechanical system and watch the motions and the accelerations of
the various parts, and we tind that mass-accelerations have a certain significance in
our system. If we keep ourselves outside the system and only use our sense of
sight, then mass-accoleration is the only way of describing that behaviour of one
body in the presence of others which we term force on it. But if we go about in

Can we group them in laws wLicli will enable us to predict future conditions and

positions ? The ancient question never answered, tut never ceasing to press for

an answer.

     Having faith in our descriptive method, let us use it to describe our real attitude
on the question. Do we, or do we not, as a matter of fact, make any attempt to

apply the physical method to describe and explain those motions of matter which

on the psychical view we term voluntary ?
    Any commonplace example, and the more commonplace the more is it to

the point, will at once tell us our practice, whatever may be our theory. For

Wecal account of the motion of the steamer.  can describe how the energy stored

in the coal passes out through the boiler into the machinery, and how it is ulti-

mately absorbed by the sea. And the machinery once started, we can give an account

of the actions and reactions between its various parts and the water, and if only

the crew will not interfere, we can predict with some approach to correctness how

the vessel will run. All these processes can be likened to processes already

-- --studied perhaps on another scale in our laboratories, and from the similarities

prediction is possible. But now think of a passenger on board who has received
an invitation to take the journey. It is simply a matter of fact that we make no

attempt at a complete physical account and explanation of those actions which

Wehe takes to accomplish his purpose.  trace no lines of induction in the ether

connecting him with his friends across the Channel, we seek no law of forcB under

which he moves. In practice the strictest physicist abandons the physical view,

and replaces it by the psychical. He admits the study of purpose as well as the

study of motion.

    He has to admit that here his physical method of prediction fails. In physical
observations one set of measurements may lead to the prediction of the results of

another set of measurements. The equations expressing the laws imply diH'erent

observations with some definite relation between their results, and if we know one

set of observations and that definite relation we can predict the result of the other

set. But if we take the psychical view of actions, we can only measure the actions.

We have no independent means of studying and measuring the motions which pre-

ceded the actions, we can only estimate their value by the consequent actions. If we

formed equations, they would be mere identities with the same terms on either side.

The consistent and persistent physicist, finding the door closed against him,

finding that he has hardly a sphere of intiuence left to him in the psychical region,

seeks to apply his methods in another way by assuming that if he knew all about

the molecular positions and motions in the living matter, then the ordinary physical

laws could be applied and the physical conditions at any future time could be pre-

dicted. He would say, 1 suppose, with regard to the Channel passenger, that it is

absurd to begin with the most complicated mechanism, and seek to give a physical

account of that. He would urge that we should take some lower form of life where

the structure and motions are simpler, and apply the physical methods to that.

    Well, then, let us look for the physical explanation of any motion which we
are entitled from its likeness to our own action to call a voluntary motion. Must
we not own that even the very beginning of such explanation is as yet non-existent ?
It appears to me that the assumption that our methods do apply, and that purely

physical explanation will suffice to predict all motions and changes, voluntary and

involuntary, is at present simply a gigantic extrapolation, which we should unhesi-
tatingly reject if it were merely a case of ordinary physical investigation. The

physicist when thus extending his range is ceasing to be a physicist, ceasing to be

content with his descriptive methods in his intense desire to show that he is a

physicist throughout.

    Of course we may describe the motions and changes of any type of matter after
the event, and in a purely physical manner. And as Professor Ward has suggested,

in a most important contribution to this subject which he has made in his recently

published Gifford Lectures,* where ordinary physical explanations fail to give au

account of the motions, we niig-lit imap:ine some structure in tlie etlier, and such

stresses between the ether and matter that our physical explanations should still

hold. But, as Professor Ward says, such ethereal constructions would present no

warrant for their reality or consistency. Indeed they would be mere images in
the surface of thinfjs to account for what o'oes on in front of the surface, and would
have no more reality than the images of objects in a glass.

     If we have full confidence in the descriptive method, as applied to living and
non-living matter, it appears to me that up to the present it teaches us that while
in non-living matter we can always find similarities, that, while each event is like

other events, actual or imagined, in a living being there are always dissimilarities.

-- --Taking the psychical view the only view which we really do at present take in

the living being there is always some individuality, something different from any
other living being, and full prediction in the physical sense, and by physical methods,
is impossible. If this be true, the loom of Nature is weaving a pattern with no mere

geometrical design. The threads of life, coming in we know not where, now
twining together, now dividing, are weaving patterns of their own, evesf increasing

in intricacy, ever gaining in beauty.

        1. On the Spectroscopical Examination of Contrast Phenomena,
                              By George J. Buech, M.A.

     The author has shown that by exposing the eye to bright sunlight in the focus
of a burning glass, behind a screen composed of ordinary ruby glass in conjunction
with a gelatine film stained with magenta, a condition of temporary red-blindness
mav be induced, during which red tiowers, such as scai'let geraniums, appear
black, and red roses blue, although the observer is still perfectly able to distinguish
colours composed of green, blue, and violet. Similarly blindness to green, to blue,
or to violet may be produced by fatiguing the retina with monochromatic light of
sufficient intensity and of suitable colour. Experiments of the same character by
Aitken, Hunt, Hess, and others, have since been brought to the author's notice.
His own, which were made quite independently many years ago, differ from theirs
in degree rather than in kind, the light used by these observers having apparently

been not suthciently intense to produce the full effect.
     These phenomena, in the author's opinion, are unfavourable to the theory of

Hering, but support that of Young and Helmholtz, with a slight modification.
They indicate the existence of a separate sensation of blue as well as of violet, a
possibility which Young was prepared to admit, though he could find no proof

of it.

    On Young's hypothesis all complementary colours and all contrast effects may

be represented as coming under the same category as absorption spectra, in that
they are due to the subtraction of something from the normal sensations which
should result I'rom the physical conditions of the experiment. According to
Hering's theory, complementary colours cannot be regarded as due to the mere
absence, or diminution, or suppression of certain elements of a complex sensation.

     So far as regards the effect of continuous light, the phenomena of artificial
colour-blindness seem conclusive against the view of Hering. The author described

apparatus by which the methods of spectroscopic analysis may he applied to the

investigation of the phenomena of complementary colours and of successive
contrast by intermittent light.

which had been obtained in the cases of water and mercury. The whole apparatus

was also exhibited in action to several members of Section A, on the occasion of

their visit to McGill College. One of the main objects of the work was the

determination of the mode of variation of the specific heat of water over the range

0^ to 100° C, for which the method was peculuuly suited.

of Professor Calleudar to London in May 16{)S. Since that time the work has

been in the sole charge of Mr. Barnes, who has now succeeded in obtaining satis-

factory results over tiie greater part of the range to be covered.

The general principle of the method, and the construction of the apparatus,

will be readily understood by reference to the diagram of the Steady- Flow Electric

tube, AB, is heated by a steady electric current througli a central conductor of

platinum. The steady difterence of temperature between the inflowing and out-
flowing water is observed by means of a differential pair of platinum thermometers
at either end. The bulbs of these thermometers are surrounded by thick copper
tubes, which by their conductivity serve at once to equalise the temperature, and
to prevent the generation of heat by the current in tlie immediate neighbourliood

of the bulbs of the thermometers. The leads CC serve for the introduction of the

current, and the leads PP, which are carefully insulated, for the measurement of
the difference of potential on the central conductor. The flow tube is constructed
of glass, and is sealed at either end, at some distance beyond the bulbs of the
thermometers, into a glass vacuum jacket, the function of which is to diminish as
much as possible the external loss of heat. The whole is enclosed in an external
copper jacket (not shown in the figure), containing water in rapid circulation at a
constant temperature maintained by means of a very delicate electric regulator.

    Neglecting small corrections, the general equation of the method may be stated

 n the following form :

                                          EC/; = JMfW + II.

    EThe difTerence of potential on the central conductor is measured in terms of

the Clark cell by means of a very accurately calibrated potentiometer, which

serves also to measure the current C by the observation of the difference of potential

Ron a standard resistance included in the circuit.

     The Clark cells cliiefly employed in this work were of the hermetically sealed
type described by the authors in the ' Proc. Eoy. Soc' October 1897. They
Were kept inimers^ed in a regulated water bath at 15° C, and have maintained
their relative differences constant to one or two parts in 100,000 for the last
two years.

     The standard resistance E, consists of four bare platinum silver wires in parallel
wound on mica frames and immersed in oil at a constant temperature. The coils
were annealed at a red heat after winding on the mica, and are not appreciably

heated by the passage of the currents employed in the work.
     The time of flow t of the mass of water, M, was generally about fifteen to

twenty minutes, and was recorded automatically on an electric chronograph
reading to "01 second, on which the seconds were marked by a standard clock.

     The letter .T stands for the number of joules in one calorie at a temperature
which is the mean of the range, cW, through which the water is heated.

     The mass of water, M, was generally a quantity of the order of 500 grammes.

After passing through a cooler, it was collected and weighed in a tared flask in
such a manner as to obviate all ])ossible loss by evaporation.

     The range of temperature, fl6, was generally from 8° to 10° in the series of
experiments on the variation of J, but other ranges were tried for the purpose of
testing the theory of the method and the application of small corrections. The
thermometers were read to the ten-thousandth part of a degree, and the difference
was probably in all cases accurate to '001° C. This order of accuracy could not
possibly have been attained with mercury thermometers under the conditions of

the experiment.

     The external loss of heat, H, was verj- small and regular, owing to the perfec-
tion and constancy of the vacuum attainable in the sealed glass j acket. It was
determined and eliminated by adj Listing the electric current so as to secure the
same rise of temperature, dd, for widely different values of the water-flow.

     The great advantage of the steady-flow method as compared with the more
common method in which a constant mass of water at a uniform temperature is
heated in a calorimeter, the temperature of which is changing continuously, is that
in the steady-flow method there is practically no change of temperature in any
part of the apparatus during the experiment. There is no correction required for
the thermal capacity of the calorimeter ; the external heat loss is more regular
and certain, and there is no question of lag of the thermometers. Another

incidental advantage of great importance is that the steadiness of the conditions
permits the attainment of the highest degree of accuracy in the instrumental

readings.

     In work of this nature it is recognised as being of the utmost importance to be
able to detect and eliminate constant errors by varying the conditions of the
experiment through as wide a range as possible. In addition to varying the
electric current, the water-flow, and the range of temperature, it was possible,
with comparatively little trouble, to alter the form and resistance of the central
conductor, and to change the glass calorimeter for one with a difterent degree of
vacuum, or a different bore for the flow tube. In all six different calorimeters
were employed, and the agreement of the results on reduction afforded a very
satisfactory test of the accuracy of the method.

     The general results of the investigation, so far as it has been possible to work
them out for publication at present, may be gathered from an inspection of fig. 2,
which includes the results of previous observers plotted on the same scale. The
curve marked Reguault, 1840, represents the well-known formula of Regnault
which has been adopted as the basis of much calorimetric work. This formula
was confessedly approximate, and was deduced from experiments on mixing water
at high temperatures with water at 15° C. The method could not be expected to
give any informcation with regard to the variation of the .specific heat at ordinary

temperatures. The experiments of Jamin and Amaury (J. & A.), 1870, by the

method of electric heating, gave a very rapid increase of the specific heat at low
temperatures, but the science of electrical measurement, and the difficulties of the
electrical method, were not at that date sufficiently appreciated to render the
results of any value.

      The discovery of the diminution of the specific heat of water with rise of
temperature from 0° to 30° C. was made by Rowland in his investigation of the
mechanical equivalent of heat by the method of Joule. His original results,
reduced to the scale of his own air thermometer, are shown by the dotted curve
marlced Ro. The coriesponding values of the specific heat in absolute measure
are shown by the scale of joules in the right-hand margin. His results have
 recently been reduced to the Paris ecale by the comparison of his thermometers
 with a Tonnelot thermometer .standardised at the International Bureau, and with
 a platinum thermometer standardised by Griffiths.' The results so reduced are
indicated by the full curve Rp. The effect of this reduction is to lower the
 temperature at which the specific heat is 4200 joules from 10° to 7° C, to diminish
 the temperature coefficient, and to lower the point of minimum specific heat to
 about 29° C.

     The experiments of Bartoli and Stracciati (1891) weiv made by the method of
mixtures, and are expressed in terms of a thermal unit at 15° C. The correspond-

ing curve, marked B. & S., bears a general resemblance to that of llowland, but

shows a minimum at 20° C. The errors and limitations of this method are well

known, and it is difficult to suppose it capable of an order of accuracy higher than
one part in a thousand, or to resist the impression that this excessive lowering of
the minimum point is due to some constant error inherent in the method, which
cannot be eradicated by mere repetition of similar experiments.

     The experiments of Griffiths (G) over the range 16° to 25° were made by
observing the rate of rise of temperature of a mass of water in a calorimeter
heated by an electric current. His work threw a flood of light on the difficulties

of electrical calorimetry as usually practised, and explained the failure of previous
observers to secure satisfactory results by this method. Over the range of his
experiments he found approximately the same rate of diminution of the specific

heat as that given by the experiments of llowland when reduced to the same

scale of temperature.

    The curve marked CB in the figure, extending from 4° to 60°, represents the

results so far obtained in the present investigation. The points indicated by small
circles represent samples of single observations with diflerent calorimeters, antl are
inserted to give an idea of the order of agreement attainable by this inethol.
The order of accuracy diminishes as the temperature rises, owing to the greater

difficulty of satisfactorily regulating the temperature of the water-jacket at the
higher points. It is hoped, however, by a slight modification of the heating and
regulating apparatus, to secure good results at temperatures as high as 90° C.
with the water-jacket, and to obtain an observation at 100° C. with a steam-
jacket.

      According to the authors' experiments, the curve representing the variation of

the specific heat is much flatter than that given by Rowland, and has a minimum
Ht 40° C. instead of .'29° C. The experiments of Eowland did not extend sufficiently
beyond the minimum point to aii'ord a really satisfactory determination. The

                                                                                                 3S2

value of the specific lieat could not be determined by his method v>'ith the same

degree of precision at the extremities of the range as in the middle, and all the

probable errors of the method would be greatly increased as the temperature of

the calorimeter was raised so far above its suri'oundings. In particular, the

corrections and changes of zero of the mercury thermometers, and the rate of

external loss of heat, would be excessive at the higher points. In the authors'

method, on the contrary, there are no thermometric difficulties of this nature,

owing to the direct employment of platinum thermometers, and the external heat

loss increases very little as the temperature is raised, because the external water-

jacket is always at the same temperature as the inflowing water current, so that

the mean excess of temperature is always nearly the same.

Another indication that the temperature of minimum specific heat should be

not far below the middle of the range is aflbrded by the experiments of Regnault,

and more recently by those of Reynolds and Moorby, on the mean specific heat of

water between 0° and 100° C. Their results by entirely difierent methods agree

in showing that the mean specific heat over the whole range does not greatly

exceed the value at 20° C.

There is apparently revealed for the first time by the authors' experiments a

very rapid increase in the specific heat as the freezing point is approached. The

CBpoint at 4° C. on the curve  represents the mean specific heat over the range

0° to 8°. The rapid increase of the curvature as this point is reached is probably

due to an exceptionally high value in the immediate neighbourhood of 0° C. The

probability of this result was foreseen by Rowland on theoretical grounds, but

his original curve, which is accurately a straight fine from 5° to 20°, does not

show the effect. The authors propose to investigate this point more closely by

taking smaller ranges of temperature, such as 0°-2°, and 0°-4° C, from which the
actual form of the curve may be deduced.

With reference to the possibility of obtaining an independent verification of

the accuracy of the electrical units, and, in particular, of the absolute value of the

E.M.F. of the Clark cell, it is interesting to compare the absolute values of the

specific heat deduced by the electrical methods with that of Rowland by the

mechanical method. For this purpose the authors' results, and those of Griffiths

(G.), and of Schuster and Gannon (S.), have been reduced to joules on the assump-

tion that the absolute value of the E.M.F. of the Clark cell at 15° C. is

1"4:342 volts, as found by Glazebrook and Skinner, assuming Lord Rayleigh's

value of the electrochemical equivalent of silver, and taking the international

ohm as correct. It has been pointed out that the results of Griffiths would be

brought into harmony with those of Rowland by supposing that the true E.M.F.

of the Clark cells employed was about 2 miUivolts lower, or one part in 700. The

authors' results, however, lie about midway between those of Rowland and

Griffiths, and would require a correction of only 1 millivolt if the whole of the

difierence were to be debited to the Clark cell. It is not at all likely that the

E.M.F. of the cells employed by the authors can have exceeded the B.O.T.
standard by so much as 1 millivolt, or that their resistance standards can have
been incorrect by so much as one part in 700. It is most likely that both the

Clark cells and the resistance standards employed by the authors agreed witli

those employed by Griffiths to within one or two parts in 10,000, and that the

difierence of the results is mainly to be attributed to the radical difierence in the

methods of calorimetrJ^

These and similar questions relating to the absolute values of the standards

employed do not aSect the accuracy of the relative results as regards the variation

of the specific heat of water with temperature. The relative results are regardel

by the authors as being probably as accurate as their present apparatus is capable

of affording. By far the most important consideration aflecting the form of the

curve in this respect is the particular thermometric scale to which the results are

reduced. If, for instance, the results were expressed, as originally obtained, in

terms of the platinum scale of temperature, which differs from the absolute scale

by only 0°-38 C. at 50° C, where the divergence is a maximum, the curve would

PPPbe that represented by the dotted line  CBin the figure. The curve  is

deduced from this by the usual parabolic difference formula, which gives results in
practical agreement with the Paris scale.

     Since the discussion of the thermal unit introduced by Griffiths^ at the British
Association Meeting of 1895, and partly in consequence of the general interest

excited by that discussion, so many new facts have been brought to light, and so
much experience has been gained of the practical effect of the proposals then

made, that it appears desirable to discuss more fully the bearing of the present
work on the general question of the relation between the various thermal units.

     Dieterici (' Wied. Ann.' 33, p. 417, 1888) made a determination of the mean
specific heat in terms of the electrical units by means of a Bunsen ice-calorimeter.
His result (when reduced on the assumption that the electrochemical equivalent of
silver is 0-0011180 grm. per amp. sec, and that the ohm is the resistance at 0° C,
of a column of mercury 1 sq. mm. in section and 106'30 cm. in length) gives
4'233 joules as the value of the mean specific heat of water in absolute measure

between the limits 0° and 100° C.^
     Winkelmann (' Handbook of Physics,' vol, ii. part ii. p. 338) endeavoured to

connect this result with those of llowland at low temperatures by assuming a
parabolic formula for the mode of variation, and taking the minimum value
at 30-6° C. to be 0-9898 of the value at 0° C. These assumptions give for the
specific heat s^ at any temperature t° C, the formula

                       s, = 1- 0-0006684 i + 000001092^^ . . . . (W)

and for the mean specific heat between 0° and t°, which may be written s *q,

                       s = 1 - 0-0003342 t + 0-00000364 tK
                                                               'o

     According to this formula, the ratio of the mean specific heat between 0° and
100° to the specific heat at 20° C. would be 1-0120. According to the formida of
Regnault, the same ratio would be 1-0038. If we take Rowland's corrected
value at 20° C. as 4*181 joules, the mean value between 0° and 100° would be
4-197 joules according to Regnault, but 4-233 joules according to Winkelmann.
The latter gives a remarkable coincidence with Dieterici, in consequence of which
the formula (W) has been frequently quoted and employed in physical investiga-
tions. It must be remarked, however, that Rowland's curve is not even approxi-
mately parabolic, and that the range covered by his observations is hardly
sufficient to justify this method of treatment. It must also be observed that the
values given by Winkelmann's formula for the specific heat in the neighbourhood
of 100°, and still more at higher temperatures, are so large that they cannot
conceivably be reconciled with the experiments of Regnault and other good

observers.

     Griffiths ('Phil. Trans.' vii. 1895, pp. 318-323) came to the conclusion from
a comparison of his experiments on the latent heat of evaporation of water at 30°
and 40° C. with those of Dieterici at 0° C. expressed in terms of the mean specific
heat, and with those of Regnault on the total heat of steam at 100° C, that the
mean specific heat must be very nearly identical with the specific heat at 15° C,
although Rpgnault's direct experiments made the ratio from O-.^j per cent, to
1 per cent, larger. At his suggestion Professor Joly performed thu inverse experi-
ment of determining the mean specific heat between 12° and 100° with his steam
calorimeter in terms of the latent heat of steam at 100° taken as 536-63 times the
thermal unit at 15° C. The result of this experiment was to make the mean
specific heat appear nearly 0-5 per cent, smaller than the specific heat at 16° C.

If we suppose that the inversion, of the experiment would tend to reverse the

error of the original determination of the latent heat, the result would appear to

be strongly in support of Griffiths's contention.

630 REPORT--1899.

     Pcabody, in the preface to his well-known 'Tables of the Properties of
Saturated Steam ' (1896), as the result of a careful discussion of Rowland's and
Kegnault's experiments, adopts Rowland's values from 0° to 40°, and expresses

his results in terms of the mean specific heat between 15° and 20°. He finds
that Regnault's experiments may be sufficiently represented in terms of this

unit by assuming- the specific heat to be constant and equal to TOGS between the
limits 45° ar.d 155°, and constant and equal to 1-046 between the limits 155° and
200° C. This assumption would make the mean specific heat between 0° and 100'
have the value 1-0044 in terms of the specific heat at 17°-5, or the value 1-0056 in
terms of the specific heat at 20°, assuming Rowland's coefficient of diminution.
The general effect of these changes is to make the tables agi'ee fairly well
throughout with Regnault's experiments, but the method can only be justified on
the ground of expediency, and can hardly be regarded as a satisfactory reconcilia-

tion of conflicting evidence on account of the asjumed discontinuities in the

specific heat.

    Shaw (' B. A. Report,' 189C, p. 162) gives a similar reduction of Regnault's

experiments by means of Rowland's original table, but tabulates only the total
heat in joules at each point between 100° and 180° C. His reduction shows a
similar flattening of the curve between 100° and 150°, as compared with

Regnault's formula. This may be a physical fact, but might also be explained by

supposing that the earlier exjieriments at 108° to 120° were about 0-4 per cent, too

high. Shaw's reduction, expressed in terms of a thermal unit at 20° C, is given

for comparison in the table on p. 631.

     Quite recently a direct determination of the mean specific heat in terms of
mechanical units has been made by Reynolds and Moorby (' Phil. Trans.' A. 1897)
on a large scale with Reynolds's break and a steam-engine. Their result expressed
in absolute units is 4-1832 joules, and is entitled to very great weight on account
of the minute accuracy of the measurements, and the full discussion of possible
sources of error. It exceeds the value found by Rowland at 20° C. by only one
part in two thousand, but is no less than 1'20 per cent, smaller than the mean

--value found by Dieterici a discrepancy far too large to be explained by any

uncertainty in the values of the electrical units.

     Unless the mean value found by Reynolds and Moorby is summarily rejected,
it is clear that the minima of specific heat at 20° and 30° indicated by the work
of Bartoli and Stracciati and of Rowland respectively, must be due to some con-
stant source of error inherent in their methods, and that all formulae hitherto
proposed for the mode of variation of the specific heat between 0° and 100° must

be abandoned.

     It is possible, however, to deduce a more satisfactory comparison of the results
of Rowland with those of Reynolds and Moorby by means of the present series
of experiments, on account of their greater range, and the close agreement of tlit)
individual observations. Neglecting for the present the rapid change of the

specific heat in the immediate neighbourhood of 0° C, it may be observed that all

the authors' observations between 10° and 60° (with the exception of one at 55°)
are represented within one part in 5,000 (i.e. within the limits of agreement of
the observations with different calorimeters at any one point) in terms of the

minimum value Sio40° at C, by the simple formula

«, = s,o(l + 0-0000045 (!5- 40)=)                                       (CB)

which gives for the mean specific heat between 0° and t° the formula
                        =s«o Sjo (1-0072 - 0-00018 t + 0-00000150 t-).

     If this formula could be assumed to hold beyond these limits over the whole
range 0° to 100°, the ratio of the mean specific heat between 0° and 100° to the
specific heat at 20° would be 1-0024. Assuming Rowland's 4-181 joules at 20°,
this ratio would give the value 4-191 joules for the mean specific heat, a result
which is still in excess of Reynolds and Moorby's 4-183 joules, but is not so
hopelessly beyond the range of possible errors of experiment as that given by
               TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION A,              631

Winkelmann's formula. It may also be worth remarking that a direct experi-

ment of Rowland's gave the ratio sWMia = 1'0024, for which the above formula

would give the value r0033.

     It would appear, however, from the authors' preliminary observation.s at higher

points, that t\u\ curve of variation of specific heat is not quite symmetrical, but

somewhat flatter between 60° and 100°. The rate of change of the specific
heat at 100° as given by the formula (Ci3), if extrapolated, is more than twice as
great as that given by Regnault, and at 200° about four times as great. The
experiments of Regnault apply particularly to this portion of the range, for which
they remain the standard, and have been universally adopted. Until more

accurate experiments are forthcoming, it would be extremely desirable to retain
                                        --

his formula for the higher points, with such modification only as is necessary to

make it fit with the observations at lower temperatures. It happens that the
rate of variation of the specific heat given by Regnault's formula agrees with that
given by the formula (CB) between 55° and 60°, The two formulae can therefore
be very accurately fitted at this point by the simple expedient of subtracting a
constant quantity from the values given by Regnault's formula at temperatures
above 60° C. This apparently arbitrary method would not be suggested if it
were not that it leads to results which are intrinsically most probable, and which

require the simplest modification of existing tables.

     If the formula (CB) is adopted for the range 0° to 60°, over which it has been
accurately verified, and the formula of Regnault (corrected as above explained)
from 60° to 100°, the ratio of the mean specific heat between 0° and 100° to the
specific heat at 20° is 1-0014. Taking Rowland's value as 4-181 joules at 20°,
this ratio would give 4-1868 for the mean specific heat, which exceeds the value

--found by Reynolds and Moorby by less than one part in a thousand a discrepancy

so small as to be within the limits of possible error even in the case of these two
extremely accurate determinations. Since it is a work of great labour and difHculty
to redetermine the specific heat at temperatures above 100°, and since it is
extremely unlikely that more accurate results over this part of the range will be
forthcoming in the near future, it has appeared desirable to adopt this basis for the
construction of the annexed table of the variation of the specific heat of water
over the whole range 0° to 220° C. The general effect of the table is to diminish
the extent of the variation hitherto assumed, but it is believed that the results here
tabulated are within the limits of possible error of all the best experiments. The
order of agreement may be inferred from a comparison of the values ofh, the total heat
of the liquid, given in the last two columns. The agreement with Rowland is within
1 in 3,000 between 10° and 40°, and with Regnault within 1 in 1,000 at 160° C.
The variations of Regnault's individual observations exceed 5 parts in 1,000.

     The values of the total heat 7i are found by integrating the specific heat from
   to t, according to the formula. The formula does not represent the rapid change
of s near the freezing-point, but accurate account may be taken of this, when
desired, at any point above 10°, by adding the constant quantity 0-020 to the
value of h as given in the table by the formula. This correction, however, is seldom

of importance.

     In the ' Phil. Mag.' vol. xxiv. p. 842, October 1887, Lord Kelvin has given

equations for the transmission of laminar waves through a turbulent liquid. He

expresses doubt as to the possibility of any turbulency being possible to which

illustrates his paper by reference to a liquid in which separate vortex rings arc

years afterwards, however. Lord Kelvin published in the ' Proc. of the R. I.

Academy,' 1 889, vol. i. p. 340, a paper in which he described an arrangement of

long, thin, empty, vortex filaments, which he considered would be stable, and not

subject to the diffusion and mixing which would vitiate the application of his wave

theorem to the first turbulent medium he suggested. I have this yenv, in the

* R. D. S. Proceedings ' (p. 51), published a paper calling attention to tlie way in

which laminar waves might be propagated by this latter medium, and have sug-

gested a way in which electrons might exist therein. The paper is only suggestive,

and cannot claim to prove much. I now desire to call attention to the expressions

that Lord Kelvin has given for the structure changes that take place when the

waves he describes are being propagated through the medium, and to show how

to calculate a quantity which must be proportional to the energy per c.c. of this

wave-motion. I must refer to the paper itself for an explanation of the notation,

as it would make this note very long to give it here.

The equations from which Lord Kelvin deduces the possibility of the propa-

gation of laminar motion through a turbulent liquid are two

to tlie energy per c.c. of tlie medium. This is the same as in Maxwell's theory,

so that there seems very little more besides interpretation of symbols to make a

turbulent liquid a satisfactory explanation of the structure of the ether

    I am myself satisfied, though I tbiulr Lord Kelvin is not, that the turbulency

of a sufficiently fine-grained purely and irregularly turbulent liquid would ulti-
mately become so slow in its diffusion from place to place that Lord Kelvin's
investigation would apply to it.

3. On the Permanence of certain Gases in the Atmospheres of Planets.
                       By G. H. Bryan, Sc.D., F.R.S.

In a paper read before the Nottingham Meeting of the Association, the author

discussed the application of the kinetic theory of gases to explain the absence of

an atmosphere from the moon's surface. In the present investigation similar

methods are applied to the atmospheres of planets, account being taken of the axial
Arotations of the planets.
                            test of the permanence or otherwise of different gases

in the atmospheres of different celestial bodies at different temperatures has been

obtained, and a superior limit has been found for the rate at which any planet

woidd lose any gas by the molecules flying oft' from its atmosphere. To interpret

this limit in the simplest possible form, the author has calculated the number of

years which would have to elapse in various cases before the quantity of gas lost

would be equivalent to that contained in a layer one centimetre thick, covering the

surface of the earth. For simplicity absolute temperatures of 200°, 300°. 400°,

500°, and 600° have been chosen--e.e. Centigrade temperatures of - 73°, 27°, 127°,

and so forth.

     In the case of terrestrial hydrogen the loss in question would occupy

84,000,000,000 years at temperature - 73°, 600,000 years at - 23°, and 222 years

at 27° C.

     For helium on the earth's surface, the corresponding numbers are 3-5 x 10^''
years at -73°, 3 x lO'-', or 30 trillion years at 27°, 84,000,000,000 years at 127°

600,000 years at 227°, and 222 years at 327°. This assumes the molecular weight

of helium to be 2.

    For vapour of water on Mars, the figures are 1-2 >; 10="^ years at - 73°, 1-9 x 10^'^,

or 19 thousand billion years at 27°, 2,400,000,000 years at 127°, 43,000 years

at 227°, and 100 years at 327°.

The removal of a layer of air 1 centimetre in thickness from the surface of the

earth would only mean a lowering in the average barometric pressure of ^-Awo of ^

millimetre, roughly. Suppose then that the afore-mentioned gases were present in

the respective atmospheres in sufficient quantity to produce pressures comparable

with one atmosphere, and assume that a fall of one millimetre in the average

height of the barometer is  the  least  secular  change  that  could  be  detected                                          the
                                                                                                                         ;

above-mentioned intervals of time would have to be multiplied by 13,600 roughly,

in order to give the numbers of years in which the escape of the respective gases

could be detected by a barometer.

The only possible conclusions from these results are

     (1) That helium could exist practically permanently in our atmosphere at ordi-

nary temperatures.
     (2) That watery vapour could exist practically permanently in the atmosphere

of Mars at ordinary temperatures.
     (3) That if helium once existed in appreciable quantities in the earth's atmo-

sphere, it must have escaped when the earth was far hotter than at present.
     (4) That a similar conclusion holds good on the supposition that Mars once

possessed, but has now lost, vapour of water as a constituent of its atmosphere,

the temperature-limit at which the loss ceased to be appreciable being, however,

lower than for terrestrial helium.

    (5) That hydrogen, on the other hand, may escape from the earth's atmosphere,
even at ordinary temperatures, to such an extent as may perhaps appreciably

affect its permanence.

      It sliould bo observed that Dr. Johnstone Stoney's investigations on the present

subject are based on the assumption that helium cannot remain in our atmosphere,

and be has assumed a temperature of -- 66° in hie calculations. The present results

throw doubt on one or both of these two assumptions.

                             By W. F. Barrett, F.B.S.

    For some time past the author, in conjunction with Mr. W. Erown, B.Sc, has
been investigating the physical properties of various new alloys of iron, which had

been prepared by Mr. R. A. Iladtieid of Sheffield. In the course of this investiga-
tion a particular nickel steel, to which five per cent, of manganese had been added,
was found to possess some remarkable physical properties. The analysis of this
alloy, kindly made by Mr. Hadtield, was as follows :

Iron  ,   . 68"8 per cent.  Manganese .  .5-0 per cent.
                                         .1-2 ,,
Nickel .  . 25-0  ,,        Carbon  .

     The specific electrical resistance of this alloy was found to be 97'5 microhms
per CO. at 1.5° C, and its temperature coefficient comparatively small, viz. 008 per
cent, per degree C. The thermo-electric behaviour of this nickel-manganese steel,
when coupled with iron, the author discovered to be most anomalous. Upon heat-
ing the couple a rapid rise of E.M.F. took place till a certain temperature was
reached, and then the E.M.F. appeared to remain practically constant in spite of
increasing temperature up to a white heat, the cooler junctions of the couple being
kept at 0° C. Careful pyrometric measurements were made as the couple was
gradually heated, with the result that between 300° and 1100° C. the E.M.F. only
varied 4 per cent, above or below that at 300° 0. The mean E.M.F. in this wide
range of temperature from a low black to a white heat was 4,000 microvolts, and
the thermo-electric curve, representing the relation between the temperature and
E.M.F. of the couple, was therefore nearly a straight line after 320°. Not quite a
straight line, as the mean E.M.F. was intersected at four points, viz. at 310°, 540°,

810°, and 1030° C. Had the cooler junction been kept at 310°, instead of at 0°,

there would have been three successive small inversions of E.M.F. at the points
named above, that is to say three neutral points.

     The effect of low temperatures ( -- 80° 0.) was tried, and also coupling this alloy

with some other metals, but no anomalous behaviour was observed.

    When the neutral points of a copper-iron couple were carefully determined, the

author noticed that the temperature of the neutral point was not the same during
heating as in cooling. This was specially noticeable in a copper-steel couple, and,

moreover, in each successive heating the temperature of the neutral point fell until

it became nearly constant. Here are the neutral points of a particular copper-
steel couple examined :

7. On the Production, in rarefied Gases, of Luminous Rings in rotation
          about Lines of Magnetic Force. By C. E. S. Phillips.

The apparatus used in this investigation consisted of an approximately spherical

glass bulb, the ends of which were left open for the purpose of inserting two soft

iron electrodes, half an inch in diameter, through air-tight flanges which them-

selves were cemented to the glass. The bulb was about 2^ in. in diameter, and

the electrodes were chosen of a sufficient length to enable them, while almost

meeting at the centre of the bulb, to project outwards slightly beyond the rims of the
Aflanges.
             side tube was attached for the purpose of connecting the apparatus to

a Sprengel air-pump and McLeod vacuum gauge. Two powerful electro-magnets

were then adjusted, so as to strongly magnetise the electrodes when necessarv.

   A low pressure having been produced in the bulb by the action of the air-

pump, leading wires were attached to the iron electrodes to enable the discharge

from the secondary of an induction coil to be passed through the rarefied gas.
Under these conditions tbe efl'ects produced in the nsual glow-discharges by the

magnetisation of the electrodes could be conveniently examined. It was seen that

at a pressure represented by '008 mm. of mercury, and with the discharge just

able to pass in the bulb (the magnets meanwhile remaining tmexcited), on shutting

ott" the current from the induction coil and completing the magnet circuit, a

luminous ring appeared within the bulb in a plane at right angles to the lines of
force and in rotation about the magnetic axis. The number of such rings can be

varied by special devices, and their brightness largely depends upon the electro-

static condition of the outer surface of the glass bulb. The circumferential speed

of the ring or rings rapidly dies down, and the sense of the rotation reverses when

the magnetic polarity of the electrodes is reversed. The rings, when once formed,
usually last for many seconds, sometimes for a minute ; and they momentarily

brighten before disappearing, when the electrodes cease to be magnetised. The

appearance of the rings is greatly aflected by bringing charged bodies up to the

outside of the bulb.

The eflfect also depends upon the manner of stimulation of the rarefied gas

within the bulb. It is necessary to obtain a particular distribution of charged

particles in order to get the best results when the magnet is excited. The shape

Aof the magnetic field is also of importance. single magnetic electrode projecting

into the electrified gas shows the eflPect fairly well. Experiments with external

magnetic electrodes have not given reliable results, the glow produced in such

cases being generally irregular. An .ittempt will be made later on, when the

experiments are more complete, to show that the formation of these luminous

rings is associated with actions observed by the writer in connection with a

separate research, the results of which were embodied in a note communicated to

the Royal Society last June under the heading ' Uiselectrification produced by

Magnetism.'

                By Vaughan Cornish, M.Sc, F.C.S., F.R.G.S.

  --The following questions are raised or discussed: (1) What is the amplitude

H and the wave-length L for different distances A from the windward shore, the

Vwind being supposed to blow with velocity of say 30 Imots until the sea has

reached a steady state ? (2) Can wind create waves of copsiderable amplitude,
                                                                              TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                  637

having a speed greater than that of the wind P (3) Different periods of residual

swell being, apparently, characteristic of different localities, will selective absorp-

tion cause waves of this period to be developed at a specially rapid rate when a
wind blows in this or neighbouring areas ? (4) What is the relation between

growth of wave-length and diminution in curvature of wave-front ?

Further, an examination is made of the numerical relations among the quan-

tities recorded in Lieut. Paris' paper on deep-sea waves,' and in Antoine's collec-

tion of results,- and in Coupvent Desbois' summary of the observations of

amplitude made on the Astrolabe. I find relations among Paris' numbers which are

useful for the interpretation of his observations. I doubt if Antoinu is justified in

Happlying Desbois' formula oc V^ to later observations than those of the Astro-

labe. Paris' observations seem, however, to be pretty nearly comparable with

Antoine's collected observations, of which, indeed, Paris' form part. Antoine,
Hassuming from Desbois that
                                                                              Loc VS, finds  cc V*, and therefore that the

HL' modulus '                                                            oc V'^, for what he records as fully developed waves. He thinks

HL Hthat this ' modulus '
                                                                              may ultimately be found proportional to V, with

remaining, I suppose, proportional to V' and L becoming proportional to Vi.
He Hfinds Desbois' empiric relation
                                                                              cc V^f ' readily justified ' on theoretic grounds.^

1 think this supposed theoretic justification is illusory, and that it has hindered

Antoine from obtaining the best numerical relations from the data at his disposal.

HI consider that his numbers are better represented by taking proportional to
HV* and L proportional to V<, which gives the relation between L and suspected

by Antoine. These formulae are statistical, not dynamic. Their value depends on
Hthe number of observations.
                                                                              can only be regarded as varying with V^ when we
H Vaverage and over a large area. Desbois' table of amplitudes in 'Comptes

Rendus,' Ixii. pp. 82-87, seems to indicate that a large fraction of the total turbu-

lence of many parts of the ocean is due to their invasion by swells from a distance.

law in this way, that, for the same average wind velocity, the average amplitude is

greatest in the Southern Ocean, i.e. south of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape

Horn, where the wind blows always from the north-westward and the wave-

pulses are free to chase one another round and round the globe. Perhaps there is

also some increase, due to focussing. Further, the specific roughness in the

regions of Indian Trades, Atlantic Trades, and AYestern Pacific is in the order of

their exposure to the Southern Ocean, which is the order in which they have been

here named. They may be regarded as branches of the Southern Ocean. The

Western Pacific is greatly sheltered from the Southern Ocean by a screen of

islands. Paris' observations do not extend to the Eastern Pacific, as do those of

Desbois. The latter show that the specific roughness is much greater in the

Eastern than in the Western Pacific. In the semi-closed Seas of China and Japan

the specific roughness is less than in the above oceans.

.3. The Median Estimate. By Francis G-alton, D.C.L., F.R.S.

The usual method is very unsatisfactory by which the collective opinion of

Councils, Senates, and other Assemblies is ascertained, in respect to the most suit-
able amount of money to be granted for any particular purpose. The opinions of
individual members are sure to differ as to rewards for past services, as to com-

pensation for damage, or as to the cost of carrying out some desirable object for

which provision has to be made. How is that medium amount to be ascertained

which is the fairest compromise between many different opinions ? The method

usually adopted is for some person in authority to consult his colleagues and then

to lay a definite proposal before the meeting, to which another person may move an

amendment                                                 the amendment and the  original  motion  are  then  put severally to                                                                                                                                               the
                                                       ;

vote, and are carried or rejected by a simple majority. Jurymen are said to adopt

a different way of assessing damages ; each writes his own estimate on a separate

paper, the estimates are added together, and the average of them all is occasionally

accepted by the whole body of the jury and returned as their verdict. Averages

are, however, objectionable to large assemblages on account of the tedious arithmetic

that would then be needed. Moreover, an average value may greatly mislead,

unless each several estimate has been made in good faith, because a .single voter is

able to produce an etlect far beyond his due share by writing down an unreasonably

large or unreasonably small sum. The middlemost value, or the median of all the

estimates, is free_ from this danger, inasmuch as the influence of each voter has

exactly equal weight in its determination. Again, few persons Imow what they
want with sufficient clearness to I'nable them to express it in numerical terms,
from which alone an average may be derived. ^Much deeper searching of the
thought is needed to enable a man to make such precise affirmation as that 'in

my opinion the bonus to be given should be 80/.,' than to enable him to say, 'I do

not think the bonus should be so much as 100/., certainly it should not be more

than 100/.'

     The plan that I would suggest for discovering the median of the various sums

Adesired by the several voters is to specify any two reasonable amounts, and B,
A A Bbeing the smaller, making it understood that and are intended to serve as

divisions, and therefore no votes are to be given for either of those two precise

sums. Next, three shows and counts of bands are to be made : (1) for less than

A B; (2) for more than A, but less than ; (3) for more Ihan B. The results are

          Aa per cent, vote for loss than ; lOO-a vote for more than A.
           B/> per cent, vote for less than ; 100-6 vote for more than B.

     Numerous analogies amply justify the assumption that the estimates will he
distributed on either side of their (unknown) median, m, with an (unknown)
quartile, q, in approximate accordance with the normal law of frequency of error.
The foUowiug table of centiles (a better word than ' Per-centiles,' which I originally

nsed), having a quartile = 1, is founded upon that law. It is extracted from my

' Natural Inheritance ' (Macmillan, 1889, p. 205) to serve the present purpose.

4. A System of Invariants for Parallel Conficjuratio7is in Space,  ^
            By Professor A. R. Forsyth, Sc.D., F.K.S.

     There is one class of invariants appertainiup- to parallel condgurations which I
have not seen noticed ; they arise in spaces of two, three, and any number of

dimensions.

    It is known that, for a plane curve parallel to a given plane curve, the normals
at corresponding points are the same in direction, and therefore the angle

between corresponding consecutive normals is the same, so that this infinitesimal
angle is an invariantive element. Moreover, the centres of curvature are the same,
so that the difference between the radii of curvature is the diameter of the rolling-
circle, the two enveloping curves of which are the given curve and its parallel.

      Similarly, in the case of parallel surfaces, it is convenient to consider the

principal directions of curvature at each point. They are respectively parallel to

one another at corresponding points ; the corresponding normals are coincident in
direction ; and the centres of principal curvatures for the two surfaces are the
same. Hence the diflerence between a principal radius of curvature and the
corresponding principal radius of curvature of the parallel surface is equal to the
diameter of the rolling sphere, the other envelope of which is the parallel surface ;
and this holds for eaclj of the two principal radii.

    Liliewise, in space of ti dimensions. To render the explanations clearer, we

consider a configuration

                                                    F(,f,,.r,,....r,,)=0,

which, as for two and for three dimensions, will be considered devoid of special
singularities. Let

If, then, a distance p be measured inwards along the direction indicated by

independent of - vanishes, on account of the relation
                            P

there are therefore n -- 1 values of p thus determined, which may he denoted by
-- Fpj, . . ., p,i-i. Further, the ?« 1 directions from a\, . . ., .r,, along the surface = 0,

in which the normal is met by the normal at a consecutive point, are given by taking

any n-l of the equations

find substituting, in the ratios determining the directions, the w -- 1 values of p in
succession. Denoting by da-r the arc along any one of these directions, which can

be regarded as directions of principal curvature, by d'^ the angle between the
two consecutive normals, and by p^ the corresponding distance (say the correspond-

ing radius of curvature), we have

                                                   doTr = Prd'^r,

so that dyJA,; for each value of >; is unchanged for the parallel surface.
      In order to build integral invariants upon the invariantive differential element

represented by the infinitesimal angle between consecutive normals, we proceed

from the two simplest cases, viz. parallel curves in plane space, and parallel

surfaces in three dimensions.

I. Parallel Curves in piano.

For a given oval plane curve without singularities, two characteristic magni-

Wetudes are its perimeter and its area.  shall compare their values with the values

of the corresponding magnitudes of the parallel curve, which is the outer envelope

·of a circle of diameter a rolling on the outside of the given curve. Denoting the

perimeter of the given curve by L, and its area by A, and the corresponding mag-

nitudes for the parallel curve by L' and A' respectively, we have

A'-A=i^{{p + ar'-p'']d^|.,

LL' = \(p + a)dy\r,                      = pd-^,

-where p is the radius of curvature at the given point ; each of the integrals is to

be extended through a range 2it. Thus

               II. Parallel Surfaces in Three Dimensions.

For a given closed oval surface without singularities, three characteristic

magnitudes are its volume, its superficial area, and the surface-aggregate of the

Wemean ^ of the curvatures at any point.                                   shall compare their values with the

values of the corresponding magnitudes of the parallel surface, which is the outer

envelope of a sphere of diameter a rolling on the outside of the given surface.

Denoting the volume by V, the superficial area by S, and (twice the) surface-

aggregate of the mean of the curvatures by L, and the corresponding magnitudes

for the parallel surface by V, S', L' respectively, we have

               V V- = J j J%, + .r) {p, + a)xdy^,d^,,

               S'= + S=j(Pi «)(p2 + «)'^^|'i<^^2i                                         I jp]Pj'?>|'i«?\|/-.j;

                          L' = (Pl + « + P2 + fOf^^l^^^i.

we write

it becomes

surfaces, we write

by the theory of binary forms, are invariantive for these linear transformations ; as

the transformations are characteristic of the parallel surfaces, it follows that these

combinations of the quantities J are invariants of the system in question. The

simplest are

of parallel surfaces.

    By way of verification, we take w = 3 ; then G = 47r, L = SeJ^, S = 0Jo,

V = iBJg in our former notation ; and then

It may be pointed out that the single invariant, for a system of parallel plane

curves, vanishes for a circle ; and that both the invariants, for a system of parallel
surfaces in space of three dimensions, vanish for a sphere.

This gives the relation

leading to a number of developments, such as

6. On the Partial Differential Equation of the Second Order.
                        By Prof. A. C. Dixon.

Taking the equation

                              f{x,y,z,p,q,r, s, t)=^o,

I suppose it solved by using two more relations,

                                                u = a, v = b,

among the quantities x, y, z, p, q, r, s, t, to give values]of r, s, t, which, substituted

in

                         dz =pdx + qdy, dp = rdx + sdy, dq = sdx + tdy,

render these three equations integrable. This will not be possible, of course,
unless the expressions u, v fulfil certain conditions. I consider the case in which

u can be so determined that v is only subjected to one condition, and I find that
then du is a linear combination of the expressions

                dx + jxdy, dz --pdx -- qdy, dp -- rdx -- sdy, dq -- sdx -- tdy,

These are the expressions used by Hamburger in his method of solution.

/=If such a function u can be found, the system         0, u = a will have a series

of solutions depending on an arbitrary function of one variable, and involving two

further arbitrary constants.

des Paralleles,' after showing that the propositions of the Euclidean Geometry are
true within an infinitesimal domain, achieves, through the processes of integration,

a series of analytical formulse for non-Euclidian geometry.

     The foundation for this analytical theory is a group of differential equations.

I adopt the form given them by Professor Killing in his well-known work oa

     The fundamental equations are

                       da sm y da                                            da

h, &c. The solution of these equations is

                          -/W(a) /(«)  -/(^)

                                                                         ;'

                          sin a sin ^ sin -y

from which, by appropriate partial differentiations and eliminations, we obtain

                       !-[/(«)? l-[/'(6)P i-[/(c)?

Awhere «- is a constant.  final integration now determines the form of the

function /(a) ; it is

                       /(a) = ^|e"^+C)/-<_e-(a+c)/<\

where C is the constant of integration.
    By defining

                                             sin .a= *(t'"'-e-«'<)

(read sine of a with respect to the modulus k) the equation for/ (a) is more con-*

cisely written

                                           /(a) = sin,(a + C).

    It is easy to show that /(O) = 0, so that C is a period, that is, a multiple of
kttv' -- 1, and therefore

                                  f{a) = sin, (a + niKir) = ± sin, a.

   We choose the positive sign in this last equation, assigning arbitrarily, for the

proper relative directions of the sides of our triangle, and equation (a) now

becomes
                                           sin, a _ sin, b _ siu, c

                                        sin a sin ^ sin y'

These are the fundamental equations of trigonometry. Out of these the entire
theory of measurement proceeds in the usual way.

     The theory of measurement thus constituted is purely ideal. There is no real
universe that can be measured by it without the arbitrary assumption of a definite
value for k, and there are only three kinds of value for k possible. These are

K" = 00 , k' = a positive real number, = a«'* negative real number. What has

appeared very startling to the modern world is that there is as yet no theory of

knowledge that can tell us which of these three diverging paths we must take.
This is an old story told in a new way.

it is called a Pfaff equation.

     Pfaff equations and Monge equations are integrable or non-integrable, according,
as certain equations of condition are satisfied or not by the functions P.

      Thus, for example, the Pfaff equation

                   -P{x,y,z)dx + q,{x,y,z)dy + n{^x,y,z)dz = . . . (6>

    An integrable Monge equation may liare three iinds of integrals, just as an

ordinary differential equation of the first order, for example ; and the terms general

integral, particular integral, singular integral have the same signitication when
applied to integrable Monge equations as when used with reference to an ordinary

differential equation ; a singular integral is one which is neither general nor

particular.

   A non-integrable Monge equation may have singular solutions ; by the latter

we mean relations in the variables x\, , . . ., .r,,, which satisfy the equation.

     3. The criteria for the invariance of the Pfaffian equation (5) under the infini-
tesimal point transformation may be found by a simple reckoning. Thus confining
attention for convenience to the equation (6) in three variables we have

                          Stt = dxSF + TM.V + dijbQ, + QSdi/ + rfsSR + USdz,
                            = d.idP + Tdd.v + dy8q + Qd8y + dz8R + Rddz,

by the commutative property of the operations d and 8. Substituting the values

(2) of d.r, Sy, dz assigned by the given infinitesimal transformation (1), and neglect-

ing the factor bt, we have

       Sn- = dxW + Vd^ + di/8Q + Q^dr, + dzSU + RdC                 (10)

          = dx(P.M' + Py^y + P.S2) + R($xdx + ^,jdy + i,dz) +. . .
          = d.v(F,^ + FyT, + P,) + F{i,d.i + ^,jdy + ^jh) +

Then the invariance demands that  5n- =                             (11>

as a consequence of                77 = 0;
hence the criteria are

                     PQK                                            ^^-^

                              P = li4 + RyT, + ILC + P^, + Q^, + Rf,. J

     Similarly for the equation (5) in n variables to admit of the infinitesimal point

transformation (1) we find it necessary and sufficient that the quantities

substituting and neglecting the factor bt, we have, after an easy reduction,

       b^li=7Tdx" + Kdy^ + pdz'^ + 2(rdydz + 2Tdzdx + 2vdxdy, .               . (19)

       v = V$, + P|,, + Qr,, + Urjy + St. + TCy + ^V, + rjUy + ^U,

hence the Monge equation (9) admits of the transformation (18) if the following

conditions

            P Q Il~S~T~U'                                                     ^^^

hold.

    By the same method the invariance criteria for a Monge equation of the second
degree in w variables may be found. If the equation is

       = =<^ =2Mi,X.rj, . . ,, .r,,)dxidx
                             Mij=0, i,j 1, . . ., w,           M;, ·  . (22)

the variation of (j), due to the iniffiinniittesimal point transformation (1), is found
to be

                       27nij dxidxj,                                               (23)
                                                                    . . (24)
where

       h=n             i--n,j=n,li=n

       2 i 2= +rriij              "(M;, ^i,.^ + Mi,,|, )

       h=l             i=l.j=l,k=l    ·            >/

     Then the necessary and sufficient conditions that the equation (22) shall admit
of the infinitesimal point transformation (1) are expressed by the equality of the

quantities

                                                           Mi,/

where both i andj take all values from 1 to n, and both may take the same value.
    It may be remarked, in passing, that these forms show that not every Monge

equation admits of an infinitesimal point transformation ; they indicate at the same

time how complicated the invariance criteria become for equations of higher degrees

and higher orders.
     5. The geometrical expression of the invariance of a diSerential equation under

an infinitesimal point transformation is that the latter leaves invariant the family
                      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                              G51

of integral configurations of the equation, i.e. integral curve or surface is trans-
formed into an integral curve or surface by the transformation.

    "When we know, then, an infinitesimal transformation of which a given dif-

ferential equation admits, at least one family of configurations, which (famUy) is

invariant under the transformation, is of interest to us, namely, the family of

integral configurations of the given equation. But it may happen that other in-
tegral invariants under the transformation may satisfy the equation. That there

are other invariant configurations is clear from the fact that a given infinitesimal

point transformations may leave invariant a great variety of equations ; conversely
also a given equation may admit of none, one, or several infinitesimal trans-

formations.

     The direction {dx\, dx^, . . ., dx\) on the envelope of the integral configura-
tions, since this envelope is a trajectory of the transformation, is given by the

continued proportion

                         d.r, _ dxo _                                         _ dxn           (25)

if the infinitesimal transformation be written in the form (1) ; further, if this

envelope is to be an integral configuration of the Monge equation

                             tP.^,^,,,,dx^"dx^''. . .dx\'n = Q,li = m, . . . (26)

the equation which is assumed to admit of the infinitesimal transformation (1),

then the same system of difl'erentials {dx^, . . ., dx^) must satisfy (26), that is, we

have

                         2P.......,li'-l2'^--^«-» =                                           (27)

    It is clear then that the equation (27) may give a singular solution of the

equation (26), if it have one ; it is also clear that no part, or only a part, of the
locus represented by (27) need be a singular solution of (26). In case the trans-
formation leaves every single integral configuration invariant the relation (27) is
satisfied identically and yields nothing new.

   We have here then a method, which consists of a simple extension of Lie's

method for the integration of ordinary differential equations of the first order, for
discovering singular solutions of a Monge equation without resorting to inte-

gration.

     Furthermore, it should be remarked that not only is the method applicable to
integrable and non-integrable Monge equations, but that nothing forbids the
analytical application of the theorem to forms no longer homogeneous in the dif-
ferentials, should such forms be possessed of interest or show themselves capable of

interpretation, since it is easy to construct consistent criteria for the invariance of
such forms under infinitesimal point transformations.

mis homogeneous of the mth degree in the difl'erentials, it is equivalent to PfafF

equations of the form

                                 2Qu(a-i,. . .,a;,,)dri=0; =; !,. ..,m. . . . (29)

                                                   i=l

A solution of any one of these PfaS' equations is a solution also of the Monge

eqiiation, and the problem of finding an infinitesimal transformation of which a
Pfafl' equation admits is obviously simpler than the resolution of the same problem

mrelative to the Monge equation ; in fact, there are cases in which the finding of

diflTerent infinitesimal transformations of which the in PfaS" equations (29) admit
would be simpler than that of constructing one of which the Monge equation admits.
It should be remarked that the invariance of the Monge equations under a given
652 REPORT--1899.

transformation by no means carries with it the invariance of a factor equation, nor
reciprocally. The invariance is reciprocal only in the case where the Monge equa-

wtion can be broten up into equal linear factors.

      These observations bring into light the double usefulness of the method as

applied to finding singular solutions of PfafF equations.
      In the latter particular form it is, again, applicable both to integrable Pfaff

equations and to non-integrable ones, and thus generalises ^ a theorem of Guld-
berg's inserted in the ' Oomptes Rendus ' of December 26, 1898, to the effect that
linear integrable total differential equations can admit of singular solutions whose
determination can be effected without integration. Guldberg's theorem makes no
reference to Lie's theories in its statement or demonstration. The corresponding
theorem for ordinary differential equations of the first order was given by Page.-

     In Guldberg's later memoir already referred to the classic theory relative to
singular solutions of ordinary equations is extended directly to total equations of
the first order, and first and second degrees, without use of Lie's methods.

    7. Before appending a few concrete examples we shall find a new interpretation

of the ( ) operation of Lagrange and Poisson which plays so capital a role in the
theory of continuous groups; it came to light in constructing a new proof o-f
Guldberg's theorem above referred to.

        Consider again the non-integrable linear total differential equation in three

variables.

                           V{x,y,z)dx + Ql{x,y,z)dy + R{x,y,z)dz = 0. . . .(30)

   An integral of this equation satisfies the linear partial differential equations

                                  ox B.az

                                           . . . . (31)

in order that the system (31) have a solution it is sufficient that the relation
                = ....(U,V) UV/ - VU/ =
                                                                                  (32)

shall be satisfied.

    Developing this relation (32) we find

(U,V)= -i{P(Q.-R,) +Q(fl,- P0 + E(P. - Q.)}g{= 0; . (33)

the hypotheses

                R = oo, /; =

exclude themselves, then we have

                P(Q. - Rv) + Q(Rx - Px) + R(P, - Q.) = 0.  . . (34)

     The solutions a = f(x,y) of this algebraic equation which satisfy the non-

integrable equation (30) are singular integrals of the latter.

     If the equation (30) is integrable the relation (34) becomes an identity, and (33)
furnishes the interpretation of the ' Klammerausdruck ' of the infinitesimal trans-

formations U/ and V/ above, namely, that its vanishing expresses the condition,

necessary and suflScient, that the linear total differential equation (30) shall be

integrable.

both admit of the infinitesimal point transformation

as is readily verified ; both admit of the singular integral
                                                     z = xy.

    The first of the two equations is integrable, hence the construction of the
previous example is not applicable here ·, but by Lie's general theory the function

(s -- xy) ^ is an integrating factor of the equation, by which we find the general

integral to be

e                          +  e                      2e

   2. On a Connection betiveen Sunspots and Meteorological Phenomena.
                            By Dr. Van Rijckevorsel.

      If from a sufficiently large number of years the mean temperature for each day

--is computed, and if these means are generally after more or less smoothing

 plotted down in a curve, this will be found to be no smooth curve. It will show
 a great number of secondary maxima and minima. Now, on the one hand, these
 seem to be sensibly the same all over our globe. On the other hand, if we treat in
 the same way the barometer readings, the wind pressure, the rainfall, the magnetic
 phenomena, we always find the same result ; a curve, very difi'erent from others
 often in a general sense, but showing maxima and minima about the same

 dates.

      The phenomenon is not in each single case very striking ; in some cases there is
very slender evidence of it indeed. But few of our series of observations as yet
 are long enough and good enough, and there is in each case evidence enough to
hope that as soon as this will be the case the phenomena will be apparent enough

throughout. '
       This renders it probable that the cause of these irregularities is not terrestrial.

It was natural to look in the first place to the sun-spots for an explanation. The
relative numbers of sun-spot frequency for the fifty years 1849-1898 were plotted
down in a curve, and the temperature of each day of the year for the same period
as observed at the fielder in another curve. The resemblance between both
curves is striking. With the exception of two or three out of some twentj^-five, all
the notches of one curve correspond to similar features in the other. Moreover

nearly without an exception each maximum or minimum of the temperature

occurs a couple of days later than the corresponding sun-spot one. These facts
seem to point towards a decided relation between the two phenomena.

     Next the sun-spot numbers as well as the mean temperatures were plotted
down, arranged in Mercury years. The two curves thus obtained also show a

decided relation.

     The next step wiU be an investigation as to a possible influence of the revolu-
tion of Venus. As to Mars, it is not probable that the series of years is long enough

--to give more than an indication of such an influence if even that.

         4. Seismology at Mauritius. By T. F. Claxton, F.R.A.S.

   A Milne's seismograph for recording unfelt earth movements has been at wort

at the Royal Alfred Observatory, Mauritius, since September 1898.
     All the seismograms have been tabulated and subjected to analysis, and the

results will be published as soon as possible.
                                                               :

They may conveniently be discussed under five heads

(a) Diurnal waves.
(b) Rapid changes in the vertical.
(c) Gradual changes in the vertical.
(d) Air tremors.
(e) Earthquake shocks.

     At_ Mauritius, the diurnal waves are of greater ampHtude than at any other
observing station, with a well marked bi-diurnal effect, as shown by Bessel's inter-
polation formula, which, for the months of October 1898 to March 1899, is

2"-61 · sin (6 + 295°-47') + 0"-73 · sin (29 + 331°-57') + 0"-30 · sin (3^ + 272°-57'),

indicating a possible connection with the barometric pressure, the formula for the
diurnal variation of which is

in -0108 · sin (^ + 49° -32') + in-0285 · sin (28 + 1G3° 2') + in'0020 · sin (36 + 26° 4')-

In connection with the diurnal waves and gradual changes in the vertical it is

very desirable that observations should be made with the boom lyino- east and
west as well as north and south, and also with instruments in different localities
and under varying conditions.

Rapid changes in the vertical have occasionally occurred on a large scale,

notably on December 5, 6, and 7, 1898, and January 7, February 10 and 11, 1899.
On December 5 the boom went out of range at 12h. 17m., after an easterly move-

ment of 7 "-5 in 10 minutes, due to very heavy rain at and to the west of the

AObservatory. On the other days the movements were nearly as large.
         gradual change in the vertical has been going on since September last, the

top of the boom pillar moving systematically towards the west. The gradual

change in the sensibiUty  of the  instrument  also  indicates  a  north  and  south   chang" e
in the vertical.

     Air tremors occur every night in spite of every precaution to insure copious
ventilation, and to guard against convection currents. They begin at sunset with
small movements which rapidly become larger, but, though of varying amplitude

during the night, do not show a marked maximum. They finally die away at

sunrise.

    As a general rule   the  tremors are greatest when the     fall  of  temperature  durino°-
                        but
the night is greatest,       this is not always the case.

The earthquake effects have, on the whole, been disappointing, the amplitude

of motion being small in every case. This gives rise to the question whether it is

possible for the ocean to act as a damper to earthquake shocks. Records from the

proposed observatory at Honolulu may throw more light on this subject.

5. Progress in Exploring the Air with Kites. By A. Lawrence Rotch,

     S.B., A.M., Director of Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, Massa-
      chusetts, U.S.A.

     Since the report presented at Bristol no radical changes in the kites or
apparatus at Blue Hill have been made, nor have the heights been increased

mgreatly. Thus, while the average of the highest points attained by the meteoro-

graph each of the thirty-five flights during 1898 was 7,350 feet above the sea,
the average of the ten flights during the first four months of 1899 was 7,680 feet,
and that of the five flights between Februarv 23 and 28 was 10,280 feet The

maximum height in 1898, viz. 12,070 feet above sea-level on Auo-ust 26, was ex-

ceeded by 370 feet on February 28, 1899. The smaller increase of altitude than
in previous years indicates that the extreme heights to which our kites can rise is
being approached. The features of the Blue Hill practice that enable great heights
to be reached are the use of cellular kites having curved surfaces, giving greater
hft, with self-regulating bridles, hmiting the wind-pressure on each kite, and the
attachment of the kites at different points on the wire, wherebv their pull is dis-

 tributed. The meteorological results obtained during the past year have been

 important ; some records in cyclones and anti-cyclones are discussed by my

 assistant, Mr. Clayton, in the Observatory ' Bulletin,' No. 1, 1899, and his deduc-
 tions from this investigation support the convectional theory of the formation of
 cyclones. The writer has given a general account of the use of kites at Blue Hill
 in a paper published in ' Quart. Journ. Roy. Met. Soc./ October 1898.

      The value of kites for meteorological observations, which was demonstrated at
 Blue Hill, has led to their trial in the United States and in Europe. The attempt
 of the United States Weather Bureau to secure each day records with kites a mile
 above sixteen stations was unsuccessful for forecasting, on account of light winds,
 which prevented daily flights at all the stations. The German and Russian
 meteorological bureaux will employ kites at Hamburg, Berlin, and St. Petersburg

 and at Trappes, near Paris, M. L. Teisserenc de Bort has already got records at
 great heights. It appears, therefore, that henceforth the equipment of a meteoro-
 logical observatory should include the kite (and perhaps the captive balloon for

 use when wind is lacking), so that automatic records may be obtained at the height
 of a mile or two in the free air at the same time that observations are made at the

 ground.

     7. The Hydro- Aerograph. By F. Napier Denison, Victoria, B.C.

      In 1897 I had the honour of presenting an illustrated paper before the Toronto
 Meeting of this Association, entitled ' The Great Lakes as a Sensitive Barometer.'
It was then mentioned that the writer, in order to prove the direct action of atmo-
 spheric waves upon the lake's surface, had devised an automatic instrument to
synchronously record both phenomena upon the same time sheet, and suggested
for it the above name. The records from this instrument have not only demon-
 strated the direct action of atmospheric undulations upon the water, but have
graphically shown that various types of undulations occur before the approach of
important storms.

      In order to more thoroughly prove the practical value of this instrument, Mr.

Stupart, Director of the Canadian Meteorological Service, permitted me to instal

 another upon the harbour at Victoria, British Columbia, the records to be
studied in conjunction with the synoptic weather charts recently instituted here
for the issuing of British Columbian forecasts.^ The instrument, which was set up

on the Government Wharf last May, consists of a recording cylinder three feet in

length by two in circumference, which, actuated by clockwork, completes one
revolution every twenty-four hours. Upon this cylinder rest two automatic
inking pens ; the one on the left records the tidal action, the other the barometric
changes. The movement of the float in the tidal shaft is transmitted to the
instrument by means of a special non-oxidisable and flexible wire, which passes up
to and is coiled several times round the large grooved circumference of the re-
duction pulley on the floor to the lett. From the small grooved circumference
of this pulley is attached another flexible wire, which passes up to and over a finely
centred pulley on the left of the instrument, then through a clamp upon the under-
side of the pen carriage, and finally over another small pulley to a counterweight

below.

     The ' aerographic' portion of this instrument is decidedly unique, for the huge
^ir chamber used is nothing less than an illicit copper whisky still, which was con-

    ' A photograph representing the instrument temporarily mounted was exhibited

to the Section.

               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.      657

fiscated years ago by the Canadian Government, and by their permission I have
converted it into an ' air barometer.' To eflect this it was only necessary to place
within its centre a four-inch tube extending from top to bottom, and to seal her-
metically the large chamber with the exception of two small holes at the bottom of
the central pipe. To complete this device water is poured into the central pipe until
the confined air in the large chamber is sufficiently compressed to sustain a column

of water in the central tube. Upon the water in the latter a iloat is placed and con-
nected to the recording pen on the right of the instrument in a similar manner to
the other as already described. Both carriages bearing the recording pens are
mounted on small rollers which move on two horizontal and parallel brass rods.
The eflect of changes of atmospheric pressure upon this air barometer when increas-

ing is to depress the column of water and float in the central tube, which causes

an upward movement of the pen upon the paper ; when the external pressure is
reduced, a contrary movement occurs. In order to keep the temperature in the

air chamber as constant as possible, the latter is deeply imbedded in sawdust.

     The recording sheet is 36 inches by 24 ; it is ruled one way for hours, half, and
quarter hours, each being '25 of an inch apart. The tidal range of 10 feet occupies

the lower portion, and is ruled for feet and every two tenths of a foot, the ratio
of movement between the float and pen being 10 to 1. The remainder of the sheet
is graduated into barometric tenths and every two hundredths of an inch, each tenth
corresponding to 1-2 of an inch upon the paper.

     The object of this instrument is not so much to furnish a very accurate
measurement of barometric changes as are now obtained from standard ones, as to
magnify the movements to enable one to study the characteristic forms and amplitude
of the ripples, waves, and billows which are now known to exist in our atmo-

sphere during all conditions of weather. Although this instrument has only been
in operation during the summer type of fine settled weather, numerous interesting
forms of undulations have been recorded by both tidal and barometric pens. The
former are known as ' Secondary tidal undulations,' and though the writer thinks
these are due at all stations to atmospheric waves or billows travelling over the

surface of the ocean, he is inclined to believe their relative amplitude and time

interval vary according to the configuration, area, and depth of the semi-enclosed

basins where they usually occur.'

     As previously observed upon the Great Lakes," and along our Atlantic Coast,
so also here, that when the water undulations are most pronounced, so are the

barometric ones, and as the latter become less disturbed so do those on the water.
     In order to increase the value of these records I made them up into monthly

rolls, which form lengths of either 60 or 62 feet. Upon these are entered the hourly

direction and velocity of the wind for Victoria, the hourly height of the Esquimalt
tides as taken from its gauge, also the same from the Sand Heads which are situ-
ated in the Gulf of Georgia near the mouth of the Fraser River. The carves for

these are then drawn in, in red and blue pencil, as will be seen upon the accom-

 panying sheet, which not only graphically shows various primary tidal phenomena,

 but the marked secondary undulations upon the Victoria trace, and how these

 diminish as the barometric trace becomes less disturbed.

      It is the writer's intention to continue this work for the following reasons :

      That, whereas the great winter storms that sweep over this Province approach

 from the Pacific, it is thought that their advent may be preceded by certain types-

 of barometric waves and tidal secondaries, also by abnormal tidal elevations or
 depressions which are known to occur when great barometric differences prevail

 over the adjacent ocean though the local barometer may still be high. The tabu-

 lating of the exact times of high and low water will assist in checking the present
 American tidal predictions for our coast, which being based upon limited data are

 not invariably correct. As one of Professor Milne's seismographs is now in most

 successful operation here, and frequently recording tremors and quakes, it is

sea waves that may cross the Pacific, but atmospheric ones that in great volcanic

eruptions are set up, as in the case of Krakatoa.
     It is hoped these observations, and data obtained during the coming winter,

may not merely assist our local weather predictions, but lead to a similar investiga-

tion upon the important seaboard of Great Britain.

           11. The Rainfall of the South-Eastern Counties of England.

              By John Hopkinson, F.R.ifet.Soc, Assoc.Inst.C.E.

     The rainfall of the south-eastern counties is here treated in the same manner as
was that of the south-western counties at the Bristol Meeting of the Association
last year. The counties considered as south-eastern are Oxford, Bucks, Berks,
Herts, Middlesex, Essex, Hants, Surrey, Sussex, and Kent. They cover an area of
9,901 square miles, which is nearly one-fifth that of England, and one-twelfth that
of the British Isles. The mean monthly rainfall for the ten years 1881 to 1890
at seventy stations in these counties has been computed, and the mean annual
rainfall at ninety-nine stations, being one to the nearest 100 square miles in each
county. Thus, for example, the mean annual rainfall of the smallest county,
Middlesex (282 square miles), is deduced from the records of three stations, and
that of the largest, Hampshire (1,625 square miles), from the records of sixteen

 stations.

     The monthly and annual means for each county and for the whole area at the

 seventy stations are as follows :

Kent, fifteen stations, 26-41 inches ; the mean for the whole area being-

26-80 inches. This differs very slightly from the mean at the seventy stations for

vrhich the monthly means are given.

     During tlie ten years, 1831 to LSDO, the rainfall in this part of England -svas

rather le.'is than that for the twenty-tive years ending 1S90, and that for the
thirty years ending 1895. Twenty stations give a mean for the ten years, 1881-90,
of 26-22 inches, for the twenty-five years, 1866-00, of 27-74 inches, and for the
thirty years, 1866-95, of 27-55 inches, the excess in this period thus bein"-
1-33 inches, or nearly 5 per cent. (4'8), over the mean fall at the same station.s
for the ten years 1881-90. The true mean for the larger number of stations for
the thirty years would therefore probably be about 28 inches.

     The mean fall for Lhc thirty years at the twenty stations in five-yearly periods
was as follows : For the first lustrum, 1866-70, 27-09 inches ; for tiie second,

1871-75, 27-76 inches; lor the third, 1876-80, 31-41 inches; for the fourth,
1881-85, 27-08 inches; for the fifth, 1886-90, 25-36 inches; and for the sixth,
1891-95, 26-63 inches.

     Tlie rainfall in these counties does not throughout follow the general rule of

increase from east to west. It does so only from Essex, through Middlesex and

Herts, to Bucks, north of tlie Thames, and from Kent to Sussex, soutli of the

Thames. Dividing tlie counties into three groups, north, south-west, and south-

east, thirty-seven stations for the northern group, Oxford, Bucks, Herts, Middle-

.<ex, and Essex, give au annual mean of 25-02 inches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 thirty-two     stations  for       the

     The following Papers were read :

1. Recent Magnetic Worh in North America. By L. A. Bauer, Chief of

   Division of Terrestrial 3fagnetisni of U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.
    1. An account of the recent magnetic work carried out by the United States

Coast and Geodetic Survey in variou.s parts of the United States and Alaska, and a
general outline of the proposed more detailed work were given. The General
Government, through the Coast and Geodetic Survey, has recently made prepara-
tions for having a detailed magnetic survey made of its possessions, the general'
scheme of which is to be completed in 10 to 15 years. Observations on ocean areas are
hkewisetobemade. In thegeneral scheme the stations are to be about 30to 35 miles-
apart. After the completion of the general survey, stations will be added in'
regionally disturbed areas. The desirability that Canada and Mexico will likewise
undertake at the same time similar surveys was set forth.

     2. The general results of the recent magnetic survey of Maryland, made by the
author, under the auspices of the Maryland Geological Survey and the Coast and
Geodetic Survey, were briefly laid before the Association and charts exhibited',
showing the isogenic, the isoclinic, and the isodynamic lines over Maryland for the-
epoch January 1, 1900. Areas of marked regional disturbances were mapped out
on a special chart. The secondary residual held of the earth's magnetism, i.e. the-
portion remaining after deducting the uniform magnetisation, was represented

graphically for the year 1900.

2. The Spectral Sensitiveness of Mercury Vapour in an Atmosphere of

   ByHydrogen, and its Iiifluence on the Spectrum of the latter.

     E. Percival Lewis, Ph.D.^

    An account was given of some experiments carried on in the University of

Berlin. The spectrum of hydrogen at different pressures, contained in vacuum
tubes with external electrodes, first pure and then containing varying quantities
of mercury vapour, was examined photometrically with the following results :

   A1. quantity of mercury vapour corresponding to the saturation density

of --5° produced a spectrum of measurable intensity, but did not appreciably affect

the intensity of the hydrogen spectrum.

   A2. quantity of mercury vapour corresponding to the saturation density at

21° produced a diminution of one-half or more in the intensity of the entire
visible hydrogen spectrum.

     3. The intensity of the mercury spectrum seemed proportional to the amount
of its vapour present.

     4. The visible radiant energy of the hydrogen and the mercury seemed to be^
divided between them in the proportion of their relative quantities in the

mixture.

by the latter, but is possibly due to some characteristic difference between the
radiation of metals and non-metals, as also illustrated in flame spectra.

3. On the Theory ofthe Electrolytic Solution Pressure. By R. A. Leiifeldt.

     According to Nernsl's theory, when a metal is immersed in an electrolyte a
minute amount of it goes into solution in the ionic form, giving a positive charge
to the liquid as compared with the metal, or ions from the solution are deposited in

 metallic form, giving the metal a positive charge according as the osmotic pressure

of the ions in solution falls short of or exceeds an amount inown as the electrolytic
solution pressure. This view has been generally adopted by physical chemists, it
being supposed that the amount of metal to be deposited or dissolved is too small
to measure. By combining the calculated value of the solution pressures with the
known theorems of electrostatics on the tension exerted by electric charges, it may
be shown, in the case of zinc at least, that the amount dissolved would be somo

centigrammes per square centimetre immersed, and could easily be weighed.
Hence the theory seems to break down.

           4. Temperature and the Dispersion in Quartz and Calcite.

                                  By J. W. GiFFORD,

   A prism of 30° quartz and prisms of 30° and G0° calcite were used. Measure-

ijnents of the deviations of the ordinary ray for W.L. 6892, and of the angle of th«

prism, were made at temperatures from 66° F. to 77-5°. With quartz botli

deviations  and  angles  decrease  with  rise  of   temperature                                                              with calcite ihey

If the deviation at any given temperature and the angle observed at that same

6. A Method of Making a Ilalf-s'hadoto Field in a Polar imster by two
       inclined Glass Plates. By J. H. Poynting, Sc.D., F.R.S.

     "When a beam of light polarised in a plane neither parallel nor perpendicular to
the plane of incidence falls on a plate of glass with parallel sides, Fresnel's formula

shows that it emerges still plane polarised, but with tho plane of polarisation
rotated away from the plane of incidence. Regarding the incident beam as resolved
into two polarised respectively in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, the
former sutlers most loss by reflection at the two faces, so that in emergence it bears
a less proportion to the latter, and the resultant plane is therefore turned round

from the plane of incidence.

    To make use of this rotation to obtain a half-shadow field i.e. a field divided

into two halves in which the planes of polarisation are slightly inclined to each

--other two glass plates are bevelled each at one edge and fitted with the bevels^

Vtogether to form a V. This is fixed in a frame and put in the usual position of

the half wave plate, with the sharp edge down the middle of the field and turned

--towards the polariser. The frame can be rotated about a horizontal axis the
--'tilt-axis' through the middle of the edge and perpendicular to the axis of the

instrument.

   VLet us suppose the plane of polarisation of the light incident on the plates

Vto be vertical. If the edge of the  is also vertical, the light passes through

the two plates unchanged in plane, and the two halves will sufier extinction at the

Vsame time when the analyser is crossed. But if the is turned through any angle

about the tilt-axis the planes of polarisation of the two halves on_ emergence

Vfrom the are rotated each slightly from the vertical in opposite directions by

equal amounts, and now when the analyser is crossed the two halves have, equal

brightness, and extinction occurs for the two in different positions of the analyser.

VThe    therefore serves to give a half-shadow field. The sensitiveness of the

instrument can be increased or diminished by lessening or increasing the tilt of

the V.                                                                      .

In general, when light conies through a parallel plate, that which comes straig,ht

through is mixed with that which has suffered two or more internal' reffections,

and if the incident beam is polarised the components of the emergent 'beam have

Vsuffered different rotations. But looking towards the from the concave i.e.

--the analyser-side it can easily be shown tbat there is a strip on each side of the

junction of the plates in Avhiclithe light has no admixture of internally reflected

beams, and is therefore in each strip all in one plane of polarisat ion. The thicker

the plates the wider are these strips, and they must be so thick that the strips

wholly till the aperture of a diaphragm placed just in front of the V.

Like all other half-shadow instruments, this instrument gives tbe best results

Vwith monochromatic light, but tlie same     of course serves equally well for any

single wave length.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECnON A.  GG3

     If the angle between the plates is twice the complement of the polarising angle,

Vsay G7°, no light is reflected when the edge of the is vertical, and therefore this

angle gives the best illumination. If the angle is about 80°, the strips mentioned
above have the greatest width. Probably any angle between these valueswill serve

almost equally well, and I do not find in practice much difierence inefficiency with

different angles.

     The device acts well for projection with a lantern if very thick plates are used.

                       SECTION B.--CHEMISTRY.

     --President of the Section Horace T. Brown, LL.D., F.R.S.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 11.

     The President delivered the followinoo' Address:

The subject which T have chosen for my Address is the fixation of carbon by
plants, one which is the common meeting-ground of Chemistry, Physics, and

Biology. I must, however, confine myself only to certain aspects of the question,
since it is manifestly impossible to fully discuss the whole of a subject of such

magnitude and importance within the time at my disposal.

    We have become so accustomed to the idea that the higher plants derive the

whole of their carbon from atmospheric sources that we are apt to forget how very
indirect is the nature of much of the experimental evidence on which this belief is

founded. There can, of course, be no doubt that the primary source of the organic
carbon of the soil, and of the plants growing on it, is the atmosphere; but of late
years there has been such an accumulation of evidence tending to show that the
higher plants are capable of being nourished by the direct application of a great

variety of ready-formed organic compounds, that we are justified in demanding

further proof that the stores of organic substances in the soil must necessarily be
oxidised down to the lowest possible point before their carbon is once more in a

fit state to be assimilated.
     It was the hope of gaining more direct evidence on this important question

which led me .some time ago to attack the problem experimentally in conjunction
with Mr. F. Escombe, the resources of the Jodrell Laboratory at Kew having

been kindly put at our disposal by Sir \V. Thiselton-Dyer and Dr. D. H. Scott.

Up to the present time our experiments have not been carried far enough to enable

us to give a positive answer to the main question, but they have already suggested

a new method of attack which will enable us in the future to determine, with a
fair amount of certainty, whether any particular plant, growing under perfectly

natural conditions, derives any appreciable portion of its carbon from any other
source than the gaseous carbon dioxide of the atmosphere.

     During the course of the inquiry, many interesting side issues have been raised
which we believe to be of some importance in their bearing on the processes of

plant nutrition, and it is to a consideration of these that I intend to devote the

greater part of my Address.

      I must, however, in the first place indulge in a little historical retrospect, and

am the more tempted to do this, as far as the early pioneers in this branch of
knowledge are concerned, since a critical study of their writings has shown me

very clearly that the relative merits of some of these older workers, and the re-
 spective parts which they took in founding the true theory of assimilation, have in

our own time been much misrepresented by more than one historian of science
 whose name carries arreat weisht.
                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION 15.                                G65

There is no chapter in the history of scientific discovery of greater abiding

interest than that which was opened by Priestley in 1771, when lie commenced

his work on the influence of jdanta on the composition of the air around them. It

has often been assumed that these experiments of Priestley, which were unquestion-

ably the starting-point for ail succeeding workers, were the result of some hap-

hazard method of working, and of one of those happy chances to which he is in

the habit of attributing some of his most important discoveries. However much the

element of chance entered into some of his work, and Iq this respect I think Priestley

often does himself injustice, the discovery of the amelioration of vitiated air by plants

was certainly not a case of this kind. Of all his contemporaries belonging to the

old school of Chemistry Priestley had the clearest conception of the processes of

animal respiration and of their identity with the process of combustion. This is

clearly shown by his ' Observations on Respiration and the Use of the Blood,'

which he presented to the Royal Society in 1776. This memoir, written of course

from the phlogistic point of view, only requires translating into the language of

the newer Chemistry to be an accurate statement of the main facts of animal

Werespiration.  have it on Priestley's own authority that it was these studies

which produced in his mind a conviction that there must be some provision

in nature for dephlogisticating the air which was constantly being vitiated by the

processes of respiration, combustion, and putrefaction, and for rendering it once

more fit for maintaining animal life. In his search for this compensating influence,

which he justly regarded as one of the most important problems of natural philo-

sophy, he made many attempts to bring back the vitiated air to its original state

by agitating it with water, and by submitting it to the continued action of light

and heat, and it was in the course of these systematic attempts that he was led to

study the influence of plants in this direction.

It was in the month of August, 1771, that he made the memorable experiments

at Leeds of immersing sprigs of mint in air which had been vitiated by the

burning of a candle or by animal respiration. To quote his own words, this obser-

vation led him ' to conclude that plants, instead of affecting the air in the same

manner with animal respiration, reverse the effects of breathing, and tend to keep

the atmosphere sweet and wholesome when it is become noxious in consequence

of animals either living or breathing, or dying and putrefying in it.' That he was

fully convinced that these observations, which he repeated and amplified in the

following year, presented the true key to the problem, is sufficiently shown by

another passage in which he says : ' These proofs of the partial restoration of air

by plants in a state of vegetation, though in a confined and unnatural situation,

cannot but render it highly probable that the injury which is continually done to

the atmosphere by the respiration of such a number of animals, and the putre-

faction of such masses of both vegetable and animal matter, is, in part at least,

repaired by the vegetable creation ; and notwithstanding the prodigious mass of

air that is corrupted daily by the above causes, yet if we consider the immense

profusion of vegetables upon the face of the earth growing in places suited to

their nature, and consequently at fuU liberty to exert all their powers, both

inhaling and exhaling, it can hai'dly be thought but that it may be a sufficient

counterbalance to it, and that the remedy is adequate to the evil.'

Between the time of Priestley temporarily relinquishing his experiments in this

direction in 1772, and his resumption of them in 1778, owing to the adverse criti-

cism of Scheele and others, he had discovered dephlogisticated air or oxygen, and

had elaborated his method for ascertaining the purity of air, or its richness iu

oxygen, by determining its diminution in volume after mixing with an excess of

nitric oxide over water.' This method gave of course a much greater degree of

precision to his results than was attainable in his earlier work, where the purity of

the air at the end of an experiment was only determined by ascertaining if it would

support the combustion of a candle or allow a small animal to live in it.

The results of his later work were published in 1779, and were not altogether

    ' Nitric oxide was discovered by Priestley in 1772, and was described by him
under the name of ' nitrous air.'
G6Q REPORT-- 1899.

confirmatory of those arrived at six years before. It is true tliat be generally

found evidence of an evolution of oxygen by tbe plants, but occasionally the air

was less ' pure ' at the end of an experiment than it was at the beginning, and this

occurred in a sufficient number of cases to lead Priestley to doubt to some extent

the accuracy of his previous conclusions. On the whole, however, he still thinks it

probable that the vegetation of healthy plants has a salutary effect on the air in

which they grow.

The reason for this want of complete consistency in these later experiments

was, of course, his failure at that time to recognise the important influence of

liffht in bringing about the evolution of oxygen, an explanation which was given

shortly afterwards by Ingen-Housz.

Priestley's attention was now taken up with another observation, which led

iim within a very short distance indeed of the discovery that the evolution of

oxygen by plants is conditioned not only by a sufficient degree of illumination, but

also by the pre-existence of carbon dioxide. It is the more necessary to treat of

this point somewhat in detail, since it is a part of his work which has received but

scanty justice at the hands of recent writers, who have apparently failed to see

how much our modern conceptions of plant nutrition really owe to the initiative

of Priestley. In his ' History of Botany,' Sachs deals very unfairly with Priestley

in this respect, owing to a want of intimate knowledge of his writings, and to the

lack of anything like perspective in estimating the relative merits of his contem-

poraries Ingen-Housz and Senebier, whose position can only be completely under-

stood after a careful study of their numerous original memoirs, some of which are

by no means readily accessible.

In the course of his experiments on plants partially immersed in water more or

less fully impregnated with ' fixed air,' Priestley had observed a fact which had

not escaped the notice of Bonnet at an earlier date, that bubbles of gas arose spon-

taneously from the leaves and stems, and it occurred to him that an examination of

the nature of this gas by means of his new eudionaetric process ought to settle the

question whether plants really do contribute in any way to the purification of

ordinary air. It was in June, 1778, that he put this to the test, and he found that

the air thus liberated was much richer in oxygen than ordinary air. On removing thi^

plants he found to his astonishment that the water in which they had been placed,

and which had a considerable amount of * green matter ' adhering to the sides of

the phials, still continued to evolve a gas which increased in amount when the

vessels were placed in sunlight. On testing this gas with his eudiometric process,

he found that it consisted to a great  extent  of ' dephlogisticated air '  or  oxygen
                                                                                                               ;

in fact, from the experimental results which he gives it is evident that the gas

contained from 74 to 85 per cent, of oxygen. Having observed that tlie ' green

matter ' appeared much more readily in pump water than in rain or river water,

and knowing that pump water contained considerable amounts of ' fixed air,' he^

was led to make a series of experiments with water artificially impregnated with

carbon dioxide, which left no doubt in his mind that the production of the ' green

matter ' and the evolution of dephlogisticated air were in some way due to the

presence of ' fixed air.' Up to this point Priestley was following a path which
seemed about to lead him to a complete solution of his previous difficulties. He

had beyond all question succeeded in showing not only that the evolution of oxy-

gen was dependent on the pre-existence of carbon dioxide, but that light was also

required for the process. It only wanted in fact the recognition of the vegetable

nature of the alga which constituted his ' green substance ' to bring these observa-

tions into line with his previous work, and to complete a discovery which would

have eclipsed in importance all the others with which Priestley's name is asso-

ciated. It was just this one step which he most provokingly failed to take. It is

true that he examined the ' green substance ' under the microscope, but owing tu

want of skill in the use of the instrument, and also to his defective eyesight, he

was unable to determine its true nature, and unfortunately adopted the view that

it had merely a mechanical action in separating the oxygen from the water, and,

to use his own words, that ' it was only a circumstance preceding the spontaneous

emission of the air from water.' He was in fact now inclined to regard the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  667

process as a purely cliemical oue, due to the direct action of light on the carbon

dioxide dissolved in the water.

     But this was by no means Priestley's final view, as shown by a further descrip-
tion of his experiments on plants set forth in the new edition of his works published
in 1790, where he clearly recognised the error into which he had been led.'
Meanwhile the subject had been taken up by two other observers, Ingen-Housz
and Senebier, and in order to thoroughly understand the respective shares which
these men took in advancing our knowledge of the assimilatory process, it is

necessary to consult not only their books but also the numerous scattered memoirs
which appeared at intervals between the years 1779 and 1800.

     To Ingen-IIousz must unquestionably be awarded the merit of having experi-

mentally demonstrated that the amelioration of the surrounding air by plants is
not, as Priestley at first believed, due to vegetative action j-jer se, but is dependent
on the access of light of a sufficient degree of intensity, and, moreover, that the

power is confined to the green parts of the plants. At the same time, whilst

recognising, as Priestley had done before him, that the combined action of plants
and light on the air was a dephlogisticating process, he did not know, imtil after
its demonstration by Senebier, that the particular form of phlogisticated air which
was essential to plants was ' fixed air ' or carbon dioxide. In fact Ingen-Housz had

but a slender knowledge of the chemistry of his day, so much so indeed that he

constantly confuses ' phlogisticated air ' or nitrogen with 'fixed air,' and attributes
the source of the evolved oxygen either to air imprisoned within the leaf, or, in
the case of submerged plants, to a metamorphosis of the water itself. I must,
however, recall the fact that Ingen-Housz was the first to show that the green

parts of plants in the dark, and the roots both in the light and in darkness, vitiate

the air in the same way as animals do. On the strength of these experiments he

is generally given credit for having first observed the true respiration of plants, but
I cannot avoid the conclusion that, in the controversy which ensued on this point
between Ingen-Housz and Senebier, the adverse criticisms of the latter were well
founded. Whilst not denying that plants in the dark have some mephitic influence
on the air around them, Senebier maintained that the greater part of the observed
effect was due to a fermentative action set up in the large bulk of leaves which
Ingen-Housz employed. Certainly some of the results appear to be largely in

excess of those we should now expect to obtain from respiratory processes only."
     Senebier's work falls between the years 1782 and 1800. The fact that he was

an early convert to the new ideas and generalisations of Lavoisier gives his views

on plant nutrition far greater precision than those of Priestley and Ingen-Housz.
His experiments, for the most part well devised, proved beyond all doubt that the
oxygen disengaged from submerged and insolated plants could not be derived from
air contained in the leaf parenchyma, but that it depended on the pre-existence of
carbon dioxide, and that its evolution was strictly proportional to the amount of
carbon dioxide which the water contained.

     ' The view which was taken by Priestley's contemporaries of his position with
regard to the discovery of the fundamental facts is well exemplified by the following

c'est lui qui nous en a ouvert la porte. J'ai ete assez constamment attache il ce beau
systome, dans le temps que lui-meme, par trop peu de predilection pour ses propres

opinions, paroissoit chanceler.'

    - It is by no means uncommon to find Ingen-Housz put forward as the discoverer

of the fixation of carbon by plants from carbon dioxide. This claim is generally
based on certain statements made in his essay on the ' Food of Plants and the
Kenovation of the Soil,' published in 1796 as an .ippendix to the outlines
of the fifteenth chapter of the Proposed General Beport from the Board of
Af/riculture. All that is good and sound in this essay is taken from Senebier's papers
without any acknowledgment, but, in appropriating ideas which he evidently under-
stands very imperfectly, he has built up a system of plant economy which is almost

unintelligible.
                                                                         --

668 KEPORT-- 1899.

     Although positive experimental proof was still wanting that aerial plants also
derive their carbon from carbon dioxide, Senebier regarded this as extremely pro-
bable ; but, taking into consideration the small amount of this gas present in the
atmosphere, he concluded that it must reach the plant by the roots and leaves

entirely in a state of solution in water.

     The work of Priestley, Senebier, and Ingen-Housz fortunately attracted the
attention of a young chemist of high attainments, who, within a period of less than
ten years, did more for the advancement of vegetable physiology than any single
observer before or since his time. Theodore de Sausaure, the second of that
illustrious name, and the son of the famous explorer and natural philosopher,
commenced his researches about the year 179t), and in 1804 published his
' Recherches Chimiques sur la Vegetation,' a modest little octavo volume of some
·jOO pages which must certainly take ranlv as one of the great classics of scientific
literature, and one of the most remarkable books of the century.

    De Saussure was a past master in the art of experiment, and the methods

which he devised for demonstrating the influence of water, air, and soil on vegetation
have been the models on which all such investigations have been conducted ever

since. It is indeed very difficult, when reading this masterly essay, to bear in
mind that it was not written fifty or sixty years later than the date on its title-
page, so essentially modern are its modes of expression and reasoning, and so far is
the author in advance of his contemporaries. It is to this work we must

refer for the first experimental proof that plants derive at any rate the greater

part of their carbon from the surrounding atmosphere. This was shown by De

Saussure by a variety of quantitative experiments of a sufficient degree of accuracy

to bring out the great leading facts. By making known mixtures of carbon

dioxide and air, and submitting them to the action of plants in sunlight, he was
able to show not only that the gaseous carbon dioxide was decomposed and the
carbon assimilated, but also that the volume of oxygen disengaged was approxi-

mately equal to that of the carbon dioxide decomposed.' He also showed that

plants growing in the open in moist sand, or in distilled water, and therefore under
conditions in which they could not derive any carbon from other than atmospheric

sources, not only materially increased in dry weight, but contained much more

carbon at the close of the experiment than at the beginning, and had also fixed an
appreciable amount of water in the process. That atmospheric carbon dioxide is
not only beneficial to plants in sunlight, but is also essential to their very existence,

De Saussure proved by introducing an absorbent of this gas into the vessel
containing a plant or the branch of a tree rooted naturally in the soil. Under
these conditions the portions of the plant enclosed always died. He also ascer-

tained by experiment the increase in dry weight of a sunflower plant during
four months of natural growth ; and knowing approximately the amount of

water transpired during that period, and the maximum amount of solids which

this transpired water could possibly introduce into the plant, he calculated that
these solids, and the carbon dioxide in solution in the transpiration water, fell
far short of accounting for the observed increase in the dry weight of the plant.
This increase must, therefore, be mainly due to the fixation of atmospheric carbon
dioxide and water.

     It is certainly a remarkable fact that the rigid experimental proofs which De

Saussure brought forward in support of his views did not carry conviction to the

minds of every one. His book, however, sufiered the fate of many others which
have appeared in advance of their time. It is true that De Saussure's doctrines

were always kept alive by the advanced physiologists of the French school, such as

De Oandolle and Dutrochet, but when Liebig first turned his attention to the
subject he found the field in possession of the humus theory of Treviranus, a theory

     ' Although clearly indicating that no change of volume occurred in the mixture
of air and carbon dioxide so treated, his tinal analytical results show a smaU apparent
evolution of nitrogen. This was due to the eudiometric methods he employed
methods, it is true, far superior in point of accuracy to those of his predecessors, but

still necessarily imperfect.

which no lonj^er took any account of the decomposition of carbon dioxide by the

leaves, but which derived the whole of the elements of the growing plant from a

Wesolution of tlio soil extract taken up by the roots.  may well say with Sach<,

' Nothing can be conceived more deplorable than this theory of nutrition ; it would

have been bad at the end of the seventeenth century, it is difficult to believe

that it could have been published thirty years after De Saussure's work.' It
is well known how by the cogency ot his reasoning and the force of hks

genius Liebig successfully overthrew this heresy, and once more established

the doctrine of carbon assimilation as taught by De Saussure ; and the accurate
work of Boussingault, who, whilst elaborating far more delicate analytical

processes than were possessed by chemists in the early days of the century,
still in the main used De Saussure's methods, gave the final death-blow to
the humus theory, at any rate in the crude form in which it was presented by its-

originators. No one since that time has questioned the fact that green plants owe

the greater part of their carbon to atmospheric sources, and the accumulated

experience of two succeeding generations of workers has added proof on proof of

the correctness of this great generalisation.

But whilst it cannot be doubted that green plants devoid of parasitic or sapro-

phytic habit derive the principal part of their carbon from the air, is the experi-

mental evidence at present so complete as to exclude all other sources of supply ^

De Saussiue himself certainly left the door open to such a possibility, and although

Boussingault held a different view, we find Sachs as late as 1865 maintaining that

it is not contrary to the generally accepted theory of assimilation to suppose that

there are chlorophyllous plants which decompose carbon dioxide and at the same

time absorb ready-formed organic substances whose carbon they utilise in th©

formation of new organs.
    Up to comparatively recently there was little or no experimental evidence to

justify this supposition, for the early experiments of De Saussure on the influence

of solutions ot sugar, and of other organic substances, on growing plants, although

very suggestive, were not of a sufficiently precise nature to lead to any conclusions,

and we must come doven to within fifteen years of the present time for anything

like a demonstration that the green organs of plants can, under favourable condi-

tions, build up their tissue from already elaborated carbon compounds just as do

the fungi and the non-chlorophylloua plants generally.

The active centres of the decomposition of carbon-dioxide in green leaves ar&

the chlorophyll corpuscles or chloroplastids, and the first visible indication of this

decomposition is the formation within these chloroplastids of minute granules of

stai'ch whose presence can be shown by suitable micro-chemical means. I have
elsewhere discussed the question of how far the appearance of this starch is depen-

dent on the pre-existence of other carbohydrates of a simpler constitution, and also-

the probability that the whole of the products of assimilation do not necessarily

pass through the form of starch : this is a subject which need scarcely concern u»
at the present moment ; it is sufficient to draw attention to the main fact that in

an assimilating cell the chloroplastids, in the vast majority of cases, give rise to

these minute starch granules, which once more disappear when the plant is placed

in darkness, or when the air around it is deprived of carbon dioxide. Now in
1883 Bohm made the interesting discovery that when green leaves are placed in

the dark until the starch of their chloroplastids has completely disappeared, there-

is a reappearance of starch when the cut end of the leaf-stalk is immersed in a
solution of cane-sugar and of dextrose, or when the leaf is brought directly in
contact with solutions of these substances. He found, in fact, that the elements

of the cell which, under ordinary circumstances, manufacture their materials for

plant growth by the reduction of carbon dioxide under the influence of sunlight,

can, under other conditions, supply theu" requirements from suitable ready-formed

organic substances. These observations of Bohm were fully confirmed two years

later by Schimper, and were subsequently much extended by A. Meyer and E.
Laurent, who found that fructose, maltose, mannitol, dulcitol, and glycerol could

also contribute directly to the nutrition of leaves.

Bokorny, working with Spiroyyra immersed in dilute solutions, found that
670 REPORT-- 1899.

starch production in the chlorophyll bodies could be induced by a large number of
organic substances, including, amongst many others, asparagin, citric, tartaric, and
lactic acids, leucine, tyrosine, and peptone.^

     Very much more to the point are the experiments of Acton, made in 1889, and
the still more recent work of J. Laurent and of Maze.

     In his experiments on terrestrial plants Acton, after depleting them of
starch, immersed the cut branches or roots, as the case might be, in culture
fluids containing certain organic substances, and took precautions to prevent any
normal assimilation from taking place by depriving the air around the plant of any

trace of carbon dioxide. He was not able to show the direct nutritive influence

of so large a range of substances as Bokornyhad done tor Spiroffyra, hut his results
leave no room for doubt that several of the carbohydrates, and even glycerine, can
be absorbed by the roots, and can contribute to the nutrition of the green parts.
Acton tried, amongst other substances, an ' extract of natural humus,' which was
an aqueous solution of the extractives of a light soil which are soluble in dilute
alcohol. This extract was found to be effective in producing a small quantity of
starch in the leaves, and it evidently contained some substance or substances

directly assimilable by the plant.
     Apparently without knowing anything of this worlc of Acton, J. Laurent has

recently made a series of experiments on the culture of the maize plant in mineral
solutions containing saccharose, glucose, or invert-sugar, and in this way has not only

obtained, as Acton had done before him, evidence of the active formation of starch in
the leaves, but has also found a very notable increase in the dry weight of the plant.

Although assimilation of the carbohydrate may under these circumstances go on in
darkness, Laurent found that the process was much enhanced when light had

access to the plant. Maze, within the last few months, has obtained even more

pronounced effects of this kind.

    When all these new facts are taken into consideration, I thinkthey justify what

I have already said, that we ought to demand more direct evidence than is at present
available before we accept the view that the majority of chlorophyllous plants

take in the whole of their carbon from the atmosphere. In the cycle of change
which the organic matter of the soil is constantly undergoing under the influence
of micro-organisms, it seems by no means improbable that intermediate substances

may be formed which in some measure directly contribute to the nutrition of the
higher plants, and we must also by no means lose sight of the possible effect, in

the same direction, of the symbiotic union of certain fungi with the root extremi-

ties of many plants, the Mycorhizse, whose functions are still so imperfectly
understood. Then, again, we must remember that we have another possible

extra-atmospheric source of carbon dioxide in the transpiration water of the plant,

which is derived from a soil whose gases may contain 5 per cent, or more of carbon
dioxide. From the amount of water transpired in a given time, and an application
of the law of partial pressures, it may be readily shown that the supply of carbon

dioxide to the aerial organs of a plant from this source is by no means negligible.
      Before these problems can be attacked for a particular plant with any hope of

success, it is clear that we must have some means of establishing an accurate

debtor and creditor account as between the plant and the surrounding atmosphere,
and this account must extend over a sufficiently long period, and allow of an

     ' By far the most interesting and important result of Bokorny is the proof he

gives that formaldehyde is directly assimilable by Spirogyra. His early attempts to
sl.ow this had been rendered abortive by the highly poisonous nature of this sub-
stance. The difficulty was surmounted by using a dilute solution of sodium oxy-
methylsulphonate, which on warming with water splits up into formaldeh3'de and
acid sodium sulphite. To prevent the unfavourable action of the acid sodium sul-
phite, dipotassium or disodium phosphate was added to the plant cultures. In such
a solution, with rigid exclusion of carbon dioxide, Spirogijo-a majnscula forms starch
in its chlorophyll bodies, but the access of light appears to be necessary.

     The importance of this experiment is very great in connection with Baeyer's
well-known hypothesis that the first act of assimilation is the reduction of carbon
dioxide and water to the state of formaldehyde.
TRAXSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  671

accurate balance being struck with the amount of carbon found in the plant at the

end of the experiment.

    Up to within a few years aj^o we had no means of even approximately deter-

mining the actual rate at which the assimilatory process goes on in a plant other
than that afforded by its increase in weight in a given time. Such experiments,

necessarily extending over weeks or months, can, at the best, only give ns certain

average results, and consequently afford no measure of the activity of assimilation

under fixed conditions of insolation. In the year 1884 Sachs, who had for some
time been at work on the formation of starch in leaves under the action of sunlight,

found that the accumulation of freshly assimilated material in a leaf may, under
favourable conditions, go on so rapidly as to give rise to a very appreciable increase

of weight in the leaf lamina within the short space of a few hours. By observ-

ing at different times of the day the varying dry weight of equal areas of large
leaves, Sachs obtained an approximate measure of the rate of the assimilatory
process which he could express in terms of actual number of grams of substance
assimilated by a unit area of leaf in unit of time. In this manner he was able to
show, for instance, that a sunflower leaf, whilst still attached to the plant, increases in
weight when exposed to bright sunshine at the hourly rate of about one gram per
square metre of leaf area. In the case of similar leaves detached from the plant,
and of course under conditions in which the products of assimilation were entirely

accumulated in the leaf, he found an increase in weight of rather more than
1;t gram per square metre per hour.

     I was able to confirm this work of Sachs in the course of an investigation on
the Chemistry of Leaves whicli I made with Dr. G. H. Morris in 1892-93, and
there can be no doubt that the variations in the weight of leaves can be used as a
fair index of the activity of a leaf in assimilating, but it is not a method which
admits of much refinement of accuracy, owing, amongst other things, to the want
of perfect symmetry in the leaves as regards thickness and density of the laminae
and to the possible migration of the assimilated material into the larger ribs,
which of course cannot be included in the weighings.

      It is evident tliat a far better plan of measuring the rate of assimilation
under varying conditions would be the estimation of the actual amount of carbon
dioxide entering a given area of the leaf in a certain time, and it was to the
perfection of a method of this kind that Mr. Escombe and I first turned our

attention.

      In all previous attempts to measure the rate of ingress of carbon dioxide, such
as those of Corenwinder, and more recently still of Mr. F. F. Biackman, it has been
necessary to use air containing comparatively large quantities of carbon dioxide,
amounting to 4 per cent, and upwards. Interesting and useful as such experiments

undoubtedly are from the point of view from which they were undertaken, we

must not lose sight of the fact that such conditions are highly artificial, and very
far removed from those under which a plant finds itself in the natural state, where
its leaves are bathed with air containing not 4 or 6 per cent, but only -03 per cent,

of carbon dioxide. I shall have occasion later on to show how remarkably the rate

of intake of carbon dioxide into a plant is influenced by extremely small variations
in the tension of that gas, and that on this account no deduction can b(! drawn as
to the rate of assimilation under natural conditions from any experiments in which
the air contains even so small an amount of carbon dioxide as 1 per cent.

      Before proceeding further in this direction, however, it will be well to consider
the amount of carbon dioxide which must enter a leaf in a given time in order to
produce an influence on its weight comparable with that indicated by tlie Sacbs

--method of weighing definite areas. For this purpose I will consider a leaf with

which we have made many experiments that of Catalpa hignonioidcs. It is a
very symmetrical leaf and a good assimilator, and since the intake of carbon
dioxide takes place only on the under side, the question to which I wish to draw

your attention can be stated in a simple manner. When such a leef is subjected

to a modified form of the half-leaf weighing method of Sachs, into the details of
which I cannot here enter, it may, under favourable conditions, show an increase in
dry weight equal to about one gram per square metre per hour. Since this
--672 REPORT 1899.

increase in weiglit is due almost entirely to tLe formalian of carbohydrates, "we

can calculate with a close approximation to accuracy the corresponding amount of

carbon dioxide. This will of course depend, within certain narrow limits, on the
nature of the carbohydrate formed. The formation of a gram of starch requires

1-628 grams of carbon dioxide, whilst an equal amount of a C^HjoOg or a C12H02O,,
sugar requires 1-466 and 1-543 grams respectively. From the knowledge we possess
of the nature of the carbohydrates of the leaf, we are quite sure that the mean

of these values, that is 1-545 grams, must be very near the truth. This amount

corresponds to 784 c.c. of carbon dioxide at normal temperature and pressure,^

which must represent the volume abstracted by the square metre of leaf

surface in one hour from air containing only three parts of carbon dioxide in
We10,000, supposing the method of leaf weighing to give correct results.
                                                                          shall

see later on that this intake can be verified by direct estimations ; it is equivalent

to the total amount of carbon dioxide in a column of air of a cross section equal

to that of the leaf, and of a height of 26 decimetres.

The extraordinary power which an assimilating leaf possesses of abstracting

carbon dioxide from the air is best shown by comparing it with an equal area of a

freely exposed solution of caustic alkali. VVe have made a very large number of

experiments on the rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide can be taken up by a

solution of caustic soda under varying conditions, and have been surprised to find how

constant the absorption is. In a moderately still air a square metre of surface

of such a freely exposed solution will absorb about 1,200 c.c. of carbon dioxide per

hour, and this can only be increased to about 1,500 c.c. even if the dish is exposed

to the full influence of a strong wind out in the open. When the surface of the

liquid is constantly renewed during the experiment by means of a mechanical

stirrer, the rate of absorption is not sensibly aifected, providing the agitation does-

not appreciably increase the surface area, and considerable variations in the

strencth of the alkaline solution are also without any eflect. On the other hand,

slio-ht variations in the tension of the carbon dioxide of the air have a marked

influence on the rate of absorption, and in order to study this point we have-

constructed an apparatus which allows us to pass over an absorptive surface of

liquid a current of air in a stratum of known thickness, and with a known average-

velocity.

    By introducing definite amounts of carbon dioxide into this stream of air we

have been able to determine the influence of its tension on the rate of absorption.

At present we have only employed air containing amounts varying from 0-8 to
1.3 parts per 10,000, that is to say, from about one-quarter to a little more than
four times the amount contained in normal air. Within these limits, and probably

beyond them, the rate of absorption by the alkaline surface is strictly proportional
tothe tension of the carbon dioxide in the air current. I shall have occasion to.
show later on that the same rule holds good with regard to an assimilating leaf,
and that in this case also, within certain limits, the intake of the gas is propor-

tional to its tension.

     The fact which I wish more particularly to bring out in these comparisons is
that a leaf surface which is assimilating at the rate of one gram of carbohydrate
per square metre per hour is absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide more than half
as fast as the same surface would do if wetted with a constantly reneiced film of a

strong solvtion of caustic alkali.

From what I have just said about the influence of tension on the absorption of

carbon dioxide by an iissimilating leaf, it is clear that any attempts to determine

by direct means the natural intake of that gas during assimilation must be made

with ordinarij air, and that such experiments can only be carried out on a com-
Weparatively large scale.
                           had in the first instance to devise an apparatus which

would rapidly and completely absorb the whole of the carbon dioxide from a

stream of air passing through "it at the rate of from 100 to 200 litres_ per hour,

and at the same time admit of an extremely accurate determination of the

absorbed carbon dioxide.

    The absorbing apparatus which we finally adopted is a modification of one
used by Reiset in his estimations of the carlion dioxide of the atmosphere. It
                                                                                   ;

Consists essentially of a glass tube 50 cm. long, fixed vertical!)' in a u-ide-moutbeil
glasB vessel furnished with a second aperture and tubnlure. The height of the

vertical tube is invariable, but its width is regulated according to the amount of

air required to be drawn through the apparatus in a given time. The bottom of

this tube is closed with a platinum or silver plate pierced with a large number of

very small holes, and two other similar perforated plates are inserted in the tube

at certain intervals. The upper part of' the tube is put in connection with an

aspirating water-pump, and the absorbing liquid is placed in the lower glass

vessel, whose second tubulure is connected with the supply of air in which the

Whencarbon dioxide has to be determined.  the aspii-ator is started the liquid is

first drawn up into the vertical tube, aud the air then follows through the perfo-

rated plates which act as ' scrubbers.' Reiset, in his work, used baryta water as

the absorbent, an aliquot part of which was titrated before and after the experi-

ment, the chanses in the volume of the liquid being corrected for by certain

devices which I need not describe.

The efficiency of the apparatus as a complete absorber of atmospheric carbon

dioxide leaves nothing to be desired, but in dealing with large quantities of

baryta solution, amounting to 400 c.c. or more, the errors due to inaccurate

titrations, or to over or under estimation of the volume changes, are all thrown

Weon the final result, of which they may form a considerable part.  have con-

sequently altogether discarded the use of baryta as an absorbent in favour of

caustic soda. The carbonate is estimated by a double titration process, suggested

a few years ago by Hart, and we have succeeded in so far improving this method

that there is no difficulty in determining in 100 c.c. of the alkaline solution an

^amount of carbonate corresponding to c.c. of carbon dioxide.

There is practically no limit to the amount of air which can be passed through

an absorbing apparatus such as I have described, and one of very moderate

dimensions will allow from 100 to 150 litres per hour to pass with perfect safety.

Larger amoimts can be dealt with either by increasing the size of the apparatus

or by using several smaller ones arranged in parallel.

With proper precautions, determinations can certainly be made to within

·02 part of carbon dioxide in 10,000 of air, so that with an apparatus of this

kind it is possible to estimate the intake of carbon dioxide into a leaf or plant

from ordinary atmospheric air, and to keep a sufficiently rapid stream of air

passing over the leaf to maintain the tension of the carbon dioxide only slightly

below the normal amount.

The air is measured by carefully standardised meters, reading to about 20 c.c.

and since the amounts of air aspirated vary from 100 to 900 litres or more, there

are practically no errors of measurement. The tension at which the air passes

through the absorption apparatus is measured by a manometer, and all the

volumes are reduced to standard temperature and pressure.

All such experiments of course necessitate not only a determination of the

carbon dioxide in the air which has passed over the leaf or plant, but also a

simultaneous determination of the carbon dioxide in the ordinary air used. The

accumulation of these air determinations clearly shows that tlie ordinary state-

ments of our text-books as to the amount of carbon dioxide and its limits of

variation are altogether misleading.

In our experiments the air was in all cases taken from a height of four feet

six inches from the gi-ound, the amounts aspirated varying from 100 to 500 litres.

In the month of July 1898 the minimum amount of carbon dioxide found wms

2'71 parts per 10,000 of air, and the maximum 2-80. During the winter montli«,

when the ground was almost bare of vegetation, it rose to from 3-00 to 3"23 parts

per 10,000 ; and on one foggy day, March 16, 1899, after a whole week of similar
weather, we found the very exceptional amount of 362. As a rule we may tako

it that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere during the period of

greatest plant growth rarely falls short of 27 parts per 10,000, and rarely exceeds
30 parts, with an average of about 2'8o. These numbers come very close to the

determinations of Reiset, and of Mlintz and Aubin, and agree also fairly well with

the Montsouris determinations.

     If, instead of taldug the air from a height of three or four feet from the groiiiitl,

we examine the stratum only one or two centimetres above the surface of a soil
free from vegetation, we find, as might be expected, a very large increase in the
amount of carbon dioxide, which may exceed, under these circumstances, 12 or 13

parts per 10,000 of air. Such a soil, in fact, gives off by diffusion int ) the sur-
rounding air an amount of carbon dioxide which is comparable to that evolved
by a respiring leaf, that is to say about 50 c.c. per square metre per hour. This
is probably a factor which has to be taken into account in considering the assimi-

lative power of vegetation of very low growing habit, but in all other cases we
may assume with safety that aerial plants have to take in their carbon dioxide
from air in which its tension does not exceed xirifTTu of ^^ atmosphere.

     The actual intake of carbon dioxide is determined by enclosing the entire leaf
in specially constructed air-tight glazed cases, through which a suiBciently rapid

air stream is passed. These cases are so arranged that the leaf can be enclosed

whilst still attached to a plant which is growing out in the open under perfectly
natural conditions, and some of them are sufficiently large to take the entire leaf

of a sunflower.

     The carbon dioxide content of the air is determined both before and after its
passage through the apparatus, and since the amount of air passed is known we
have all the data requisite for determining the actual amount retained by the

leaf.

    An experiment generally lasts from five to six hours, and the carbon dioxide

fixed in this time may amount to 150 c.c. or more, the actual error of determina-

tion being very small indeed.

     For purposes of comparison the volumes are reduced to the actual number of
cubic centimetres of the gas absorbed by a square metre of leaf in one hour, which
of course necessitates an exact determination of the area of the leaf. This is most
conveniently efiected by printing the leaf on sensitised paper, and tracing round

--its outline with a planimeter set to read oil' square centimetres a far more

accurate and expeditious plan than that of cutting out a facsimile of the leaf from

paper of a known weight per unit of area.
     If it is desired to estimate the assimilative power of a leaf in an atmosphere

artificially enriched with carbon dioxide, the air stream before entering the lealf
case is passed through a small tower containing fragments of marble, over which
there drops a very slow stream of dilute acid, whose rate of flow is so propor-
tioned to the air stream as to give about the desired enrichment with carbon
dioxide. The stream of air is then divided, one part going on directly to the leaf
case, whilst the other passes through a separate ab.'^orption apparatus and meter
for the accurate detenuination of its carbon dioxide content.

      In order to show the kind of results obtained in this manner I will give one or

two examples.

    A leaf 01 the sunflower, having an area of 617'6 sq. cm., was enclosed in its

case whilst still attached to the plant, and was exposed to the strong diffuse light

of a clouded sky for five and a half hours, air being passed over it at the rate of

nearly 150 litres per hour. The content of the air in carbon dioxide as it entered

the apparatus was 280 parts per 10,000, and this was reduced to 1'74 parts per

10,000 during its passage over the leaf. This corresponds to a total absorption of

139'95 c.c. of carbon dioxide, or to an intake of 412 c.c. per square metre per

hour. If we assume that the average composition of the carbohydrates formed is

that of a CgHjjOg sugar, the above amount of carbon dioxide corresponds to the

formation of 0"55 gram of carbohydrate per square metre per hour. But we must

--bear in mind that the average tension of the carbon dioxide in the leaf case was

only equal to 1'93 parts per 10,000 that is, only about seven-tenths of its tension
Ain the normal air.
                     correction has therefore to be made if we wish to know how

much the leaf would have taken in, under similar conditions of insolation, if it had

been bathed with a current of air of sufficient rapidity to practically keep the

Weamount of carbon dioxide constant at its normal amount of 2'8 per 10,000.

shall see later on that, well within the limits of this experiment, the intake is

proportional to the tension, so that applying this correction we may conclude that

Under identical conditions of insolation and temperature this leaf would have taken
in an amount of carbon dioxide from the free air at a rate sufficient to produce
0'8 pram of carboliydrate per square metre per hour. This is almost exactly equal
to the assimilation rate of the sunflower which I deduced in 1892 from the indirect

process of weighing equal areas of the leaf lamina before and after insolation, and
it also agrees fairly well with some of Sachs's original experiments of a similar

nature.

In another experiment made with the leaf of Catalpa hignonioides in full sun-

light the amount of cnrbon dioxide in the air passing over the leaf fell from 2-80

to r79 parts per 10,000, the total hourly intake for the square metre being

S44"8 c.c. When this is corrected for tension it corresponds to an assimilation in

An increase in the intensity of the dayhght, as might be expected, influences to

some  extent  the  rate of intake of  atmospheric  carbon dioxide                                                                        but providing the

illumination has reached a certain minimum amount, a further increase in the

radiant energy incident on the leaf does not result in anything like a proportional

Weamount of assimilation.  have found, for instance, that the rate of assimilation

of a sunflower leaf, exposed to the clear northern sky on a warm summer's day,

was about one-half of what it was when the leaf was turned round so as to receive

Nowthe direct rays of the sun almost normal to its surface.  in this latter case

the actual radiant energy received by the leaf was at least twelve times

greater than was received from the northern sky, but the assimilation was onlv

doubled.

      These diff'erences in the eS'ect of great variation of illumination become still

 less marked when we use air which has been artificially enriched with carbon
dioxide. In one instance of this kind, for example, we found the assimilation in

 the full diff'use light of the northern sky to be 87 per cent, of what it was in

 direct sunshine.

   --This brings me to another interesting point on which I have already touched

 slightly the enormous influence which slight changes in the carbon dioxide con-
tent of the air exert on the rate of its ingress into the assimilating leaf.

     With a constant illumination, either in direct sunlight or diffuse light, the

assimilatory process responds to the least variation in the carbon dioxide, and
within certain limits, not yet clearly defined, the intake of that gas into the leaf
follows the same rule as the one which holds good with regard to the absorption

of carbon dioxide by a freely exposed surface of a solution of caustic alkali ; that
is to say, from air containing small but variable quantities of carbon dioxide the

intake is directly proportional to the tension of that (/as.

   A single experiment will be sufficient to illustrate this.
   A large sunflower leaf, still attached to the plant, and exposed to a clear

northern sky, gave an assimilation rate equal to Jjol gram of carbohydrate per
square metre per hour, when air was passed containing an average amount of 2'22

parts of carbon dioxide per 10,000. When the experiment was repeated under

similar conditions of illumination, but with air containing 14-82 parts of COj per
10,000, the intake corresponded to an hourly formation of 2'409 grams of carbo-
hj'drate per square metre. The ratio of the tensions of the carbon dioxide in the
two experiments is 1 to 67, and the assimilatory ratio is 1 to 7'2, so that the

increased assimilation is practically proportional to the increase in tension of the
carbon dioxide.

      Since an increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere surrounding a leaf is
followed by increased assimilation even in diffuse daylight, it is clear that, under
all ordinary conditions of illumination, the rays of the right degree of refrangibility
for producing decomposition of carbon dioxide are largely in excess of the power
of the leaf to utilise them. Under natural conditions this excess of radiant energy
of the right wave-length must, from the point of view of the assimilatory process,
be wasted, owing to the limitation imposed by the high degree of dilution of

atmospheric carbon dioxide. But although the actual mauufiicture of new material
within the leaf lamina is so largely influenced by small variations in the carbon
dioxide of the air, we are nob justified in concluding that the plant as a whole will

                                                                                                                                         X X2

necessarily respond to sucli changes iu atmospheric environment, since the Complex

physiological changes involved in metaholism and growth may have become so inti-

mately correlated that the perfect working of the mechanism of the entire plant

mny now onlv be possible in an atmosphere containing about three parts of carbon

dioxide in 10^000.

   We have commenced a series of experiments which will> I hope, throw con-

siderable light on this point, but the work is not at present in a sufficiently

advanced state for me to make more than a passing allusion to it.

     The penetration of the highly diluted carbon dioxide of the atmosphere into

the interior air-spaces of the leaf on its way to the active centres of assimilation

must, in the iirst instance, be a purely physical process, and no explanation of this
can be accepted which does not conform to the physical properties of the gases

involved.

     Since there is no mechanism in the leaf capable of producing an ebb and flow
of gases within the air-spaces of the mesophyll in any way comparable with the
movements of the tidal air in the lungs of animals, and since also the arrangement
of the stomatic openings is such as to effect a rapid equalisation of pressure within

and without the leaf, we must search for the cause of the gaseous exchange, not in
any mass movement, but in some form of diffusion. This may take place in the

form of open diffusion through the minute stomatic apertures, which are in com-
munication both with the outer air and the intercellular spaces, or the gaseous
exchange may take place through the cuticle and epidermis by a process oi gaseous
osmosis, similar to that which Graham investigated in connection with certain

colloid septa.

     For many years there has been much controversy as to which form of gaseous

diffusion is the more active in producing the natural interchanges of gases in the
leaf. The present occasion is not one in which full justice can be done to the large
amount of experimental work which has from time to time been carried out in this

direction. Up to comparatively recently the theory of cuticular osmosis has been

the one which has been more commonly accepted, free diffusion through the open
stomata being considered quite subsidiary. In 1895, however, Mr. F. F. Black-
man brought forward two remarkable papers which opened up an entirely new
aspect of the subject. After showing the fallacy underlying certain experiments
of Boussingault, which had been generally supposed to prove the osmotic theory
of exchange, Mr. Blackman gave the results of his own experiments with a new
and beautifully constructed apparatus, which enabled him to measure very minute
quantities of carbon dioxide given off" from small areas of the upper and under sides
of a respiring leaf, and also to determine the relative intake of carbon dioxide by the
two surfaces during assimilation in air artificially charged with that gas. The
conclusions drawn are that respiratory egress, and assimilatory ingress of carbon

dioxide, do not occur in the upper side of a leaf if this is devoid of stomatic open-

ings, and that when these openings exist on both the upper and under sides the

gaseous exchanges of both physiological processes are directly proportional to the

number of stomata on equal areas; hence in all probability the exchanges take
place only through the stomata.'

     These observations of Mr. Blackman are of such far-reaching importance, and
lead, as we shall see presently, to such remarkable conclusions with regard to the
rate of diffusion of atmospheric carbon dioxide, that we felt constrained to inquire
into the matter further, and for this purpose we employed a modified form of the

apparatus which we have used throughout our work on assimilation. This was so

     ' There is one important fact to be borne in mind when considering how far these
observations exclude the possibility of cuticular osmosis. In the many leaves we
have examined, Mr. Escombe and I have found that the occurrence of stomata on
the upper surface of the leaf is alwavs correlated with a much less dense palisade
parenchyma. The cuticle and epidermis under these conditions are in a much more
favourable state to allow carbon dioxide to pass into the leaf by osmosis than when
the closely packed palisade cells abut against the epidermis, as they do when this ia

imperforate.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  . G77

 arranged that a current of ordinary air could be passed, just as in Mr. Blackman's
 exDeriments, over the upper and lower surface of a leaf separately, the increase or
decrease in the carbon dioxide content of the air being determined by absorption
and titration in the manner I have already alluded to.

     In this way we were able to employ comparatively large leaf areas, and to con-
tinue an experiment for several hours, so that we had relatively large amounts of
 carbon dioxide to deal with, and the ratios of gaseous exchange of the two sides

 of the leaf could consequently be determined with considerable accuracy.
      Our results, on the whole, are decidedly confirmatory of Mr. Blackman's

 observations. The side of a leaf which is devoid of stomatic openings certainly
 neither allows any carbon dioxide to escape during respiration, nor does it permit
the ingress of that gas when the conditions are favourable for assimilation. On
the other hand, when stomata exist on both the upper and under sides of a leaf
gaseous exchanges take place through both surfaces, and, as a rule, in some sor
of rough proportion to the distribution of the openings. There is, however, undijr
strong illumination, a greater intake of carbon dioxide through the upper surface
than would be expected from a mere consideration of the ratio of distribution of
the stomata.' Nevertheless, the general connection between gaseous exchange
and distribution of stomata is so well brought out that we must regard it as highly
probable that these minute openings are the true paths by which the carbon
dioxide enters and leaves the leaf.

    We must now look at certain physical consequences which proceed from this

assumption, and see how far they can be justified by the known or ascertainable

properties of carbon dioxide at very low tensions.
     The leaf of Catalpa bignonioides is hypostomatic, and therefore takes in carbon

dioxide only by its lower surface. Under favourable conditions it is quite possible,

during assimilation, to obtain an intake of atmospheric carbon dioxide into this leaf
at the rate of 700 c.c. per square metre per hour (measured at 0° and 760 mm.),
corresponding to an average linear velocity of the carbon dioxide molecules of 3"8
centimetres per minute, supposing the intake to be distributed evenly over the
whole of the lower leaf surface. This velocity is almost exactly one-half of that
at which carbon dioxide will enter a freely exposed surface of a solution of caustic
alkali. But if the intake of the gas is confined to the stomatic openings of the

leaf, its velocity of ingress must be very much greater than this.

    We have carefully determined the number of stomata occurring on a given

area of this particular leaf, and also the dimensions of the openings, and find that
the total area of the openings, supposing them to be dilated to the fullest possible
extent, amounts to just under one per cent, of the leaf surface. It follows from

this that the average velocity of the atmospheric carbon dioxide in passing through
these openings must be 380 centimetres />«· minute, that is to say, just fifty times
greater than into a freely exposed absorbent surface of alkali. In other words,

     ' Granted that the stomata constitute the paths of gaseous exchange, it is clear that
the amount of diffusion through them, other things being equal, must de|.end very
largely on the extent to which they are opened. The delicate self-regulating appa-
ratus which governs the size of the openings is so readilj' influenced, amongst other

things, by differences of illumination, that a irrion we should not expect the stomata
on the upper surface of an insolated leaf to be in the same condition as those of the
more shaded lower surface. This may very well account for the stomatic ratio of
the two sides not being in closer correspondence with the assimilatory ratios, as
found in most of our experiments carried out in bright sunlight. In light of lesser
intensity there is always a closer correspondence of the two ratios.

    There is also another possible explanation of the fact. Since we have good
reason to believe that the principal part of the assimilatory work is carried on by

the palisade parenchyma, which occurs in the upper side of the leaf, the tension of
the carbon dioxide in the air spaces of that part of the mesophyll is probably less
than it is in the spongy parenchyma. There will, therefore, be a higher 'diffusion
gradient ' between the carbon dioxide of the outer and inner air in the former case
than in the latter, and this would certainly tend to a more rapid diffusion through
tlie openings in the upper side of the leaf,
                                                                                        '

supposing every one of the stomatic openings of this leaf could be filled up with a
solution of caustic alkali, the absorbent power of the leaf as a whole would only

be -^ of what it actually is when assimilaticg.

These are some of the consequences which flow from an acceptance of the

hypothesis of stomatic exchange, and it appeared to be impossible to accept that

hypothesis unreservedly without some collateral evidence that these comparatively

nigh velocities of diffusion are physically possible when dealing with such low
gradients of tension as must necessarily exist when the highest amount of carbon

dioxide does not exceed "03 per cent.

The well-known general law expressing the rate of the spontaneous inter-

mixture of two gases when there is no intervening septum, was, as every one
knows, established by Graham, and the more elaborate investigations of Loschmidt
many years later served to confirm the general accuracy of this law, and to show

that, within very narrow limits, the diffusion constant varies in different gases

inversely as the square roots of their densities.

     But a mere knowledge of the diffusion constants of air and carbon dioxide doea

not, as far as I can see, materially assist us in the particular case we have under
consideration. In order to gain some idea of what is actually possible in the way
of stomatic diffusion in an assimilating leaf, we must know something of the actual

rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide can be made to pass into a small chamber
containing air at the outside tension, but in which the carbon dioxide is kept down
almost to the vanishing point by some rapid process of absorption ; and we must
also determine the influence of varying the size of the aperture through which the

difi'usion takes place.

Our attempts to answer these questions experimentally have led us into a long

investigation, which promises to be of wider interest than we had first imagined.

I only propose to give on this occasion a general account of the results so

far as they affect the physical question of the intake of carbon dioxide into the

plant.

    When a shallow vessel containing a solution of caustic alkali is completely

covered, the air above the liquid is very speedily deprived of the whole of its carbon

dioxide. If we now imagine a hole to be made in the cover of the vessel, carbon

dioxide will enter the air-space by free difiusion, and its amount can be very accu-

rately determined by subsequent titration in the manner I have previously referred

to. The time occupied by the experiment and the dimensions of the aperture being

known, we can express the results in actual amounts of carbon dioxide passing

through unit area of aperture in unit of time ; or, since the tension of that gas in

the outer air is known, we can express the average rate of the carbon dioxide

molecules across the aperture in terms of actual measurement, say centimetres per

minute,

"We have made a very large number of experiments of this kind, using, in the

first instance, dishes of about 9 cm. in diameter, and varying the size of the holes

iu the cover, the air-space over the absorbent liquid being always the same.

The accompanying curve, fig. 1, illustrates the effect which a gradually

decreasing orifice has on the rate of diflFusiou of atmospheric carbon dioxide under

these conditions. The diameters of the orifice in millimetres are given on the

abscissa line, and the rates of diffusion through equal areas of the apertures are

taken as ordinates, the rate of absorption in the open dish under similar conditions

being taken as unity.

It will be seen that in the first instance a gradual reduction of the diameter of

the opening is accompanied by a very regular increase in the rate of passage of the

carbon dioxide until a diameter of about 60 mm. is reached ; that is to say, up to a

Apoint at which about two-thirds of the area of the dish is covered.          further

progressive diminution in the size of the aperture makes comparatively little

difference in the difi'usion rate until we reach about 20 mm., beyond which the

curve again begins to rise, increasing rapidly in steepness as the apertures become

smaller.

The experiments with open dishes are too crude for a study of the influence of

very small apertures, so for this part of our work wo constructed a special forni of

apparatus which has enabled us to determine the relative rates of dift'usion through

orifices in thin metal plates ranging down to 1 mm. in diameter.

     I have plotted the results of such a series of experiments (see fig. 2), showing
the relative rates of diffusion of atmospheric carbon dioxide through equal areas of

apertures between 20 mm. and 1 mm. iu diameter, under constant conditions, and
it will be noticed how very steep the curve becomes after diameters of 5 or 6 mm.

      This corresponds to an actual average rate of passage of the moleculea of the
atmospheric carbon dioxide of about 266 centimetres per minute.

    Now, we have already seen, in the case of a Catalpa leaf, that if the gaseous
exchange during assimilation goes on only through the stomatic openings, we
require a minimum velocity of something like 380 centimetres per minute, a velocity
which we are sensibly approaching in our experiments with apertures of about
1 mm. in diameter. But the effective area of a stomatic opening of the Catalpa

leaf is equal to that of a circle with a diameter of less than ^^jj mm., and since our
experiments indicate a very rapid increase in the velocity of diffusicm as the aperture

is diminished, it is clear that no difficulty, as regards the physics of the question, can

be raised against the idea that atmospheric carbon dioxide reaches the active
centres of assimilation by a process of free diffusion through the leaf stomata.

One of the most interesting problems connected with plant assimilation relates

to the efficiency of a green leaf as an absorber and transformer of the radiant

energy incident upon it.
    It is already well known that the actual amount of energy stored up in the

products of assimilation bears a very small proportion to the total amount reaching

the leaf: in other words, the leaf, regarded from a thermo-dynamic point of view,

Weis a machine with a very low ' economic coefficient.'     require, however, to

know much more than this, and to ascertain, amongst other things, how the

efficiency of the machine varies under different conditions of insolation, and in

iitmospheres containing varying amounts of carbon dioxide.

The measure of the two principal forms of work done within the leaf, the

vaporisation of the transpiration water on the one hand, and the reduction of

farbon dioxide and water to the form of carbohydrates on the other, can be ascer-

tained by modifying our experiments in such a manner as to allow the transpiration

water to be determined, as well as the intake of carbon dioxide.

     For the actual measurement of the total energy incident on the leaf under

various conditions we are now using one of Professor Callendar's recording

radiometers of specially delicate construction, which will be ultimately calibrated

in calories. This instrument gives promise of excellent results, but up to the

present time the work we have done with it is not sufficiently advanced for me to

Wedescribe.  may, however, obtain a very fair idea of the variation in the

efficiency of a leaf from one or two examples in which the amount of incident

enersj-y was deduced from other considerations.

In the case of a sunflower leaf exposed to the strong sunlight of a brilliant day

in August the average amount of radiant energy falling on the leaf during the five
liours occupied by the experiment was estimated at 600,000 calories per square

metre per hour. The average hourly transpiration of water during that time was

at the rate of 275 c.c. per square metre, and the assimilated carbohydrate, estimated

by the intake of carbon dioxide, was at the rate of 0'8 gram per square metre per

hour.

The vaporisation of 275 c.c. of water must have required the expenditure of

166,800 calories, and the endothermic production of 0-8 gi-am of carbohydrate

(taking the heat of combustion at 4,000 gram calories) corresponds to the absorp-

tion of 3,200 calories. Thus, as the final result under these particular conditions

(if experiment, we find that the leaf has absorbed and converted into internal work

about 28 per cent, of the total radiant energy incident on it, 27'5 per cent, being

used up in the vaporisation of water, and only onu-ha^f jyer cent, in the actual
work of assimilation.

In strong diffu-^e light, such as that from a northern sky on a clear summer's

day, the leaf has a higher ' economic coefficient,' using that term in rela-

tion to the permanent storage of energy in the assimilatory products. In one

instance of this kind in which the total energy received by the leaf was approxi-

mately 60,000 calories per square metre per hour, it was found that 96 c.c. of

water were evaporated and 0*41 gram of carbohydrate was formed for the same

area and time. This indicates an absorption and utilisation by the leaf of some-

thing like 05 per cent, of the incident energy, of which 27 per cent, has been made

use of for actual work of assimilation as against 0*.5 per cent, in brilliant sun-

shine.

     From what I have said previously ahout the effect of increased tension of

carhou dioxide on the rate of assimilation, it must follow that the ' efficiency ' of a
leaf as regards the permanent storage of energy must, ceeteris paribus, be increased

when small additions of that gas are made to the surrounding air.

     In one such instance, in which the air had been enriched with carbon dioxide
to the extent of about five and a half times the normal amount, it was estimated
that the ' efficiency ' of the leaf for bright sunshine was raised from 0'5 to 2-0 per

cent.

     Up to the present we have been regarding the efficiency of the assimilatory

mechanism of a plant in reference to the total energy of all grades which falls upon
the leaf. It is of course well known that the power of decomposing carbon dioxide
is limited to rays of a certain refrangibility, and the researches of Timiriazeff,
Engelmann, and others leave little room to doubt that the rays of the spectrum
which are instrumental in producing the reaction in the chloroplastids have a dis-

tinct relation to the absorption bands of the leaf-chlorophyll. By far the greater

amount of the assimilatory work, probably more than 90 per cent, of it, is effected
by the rays which correspond to the principal absorption band in the red, lying

between wave lengths 6,500 and 6,975." If, therefore, we express the distri-
bution of energy in a normal solar spectrum in the form of a curve, we have
the means of approximately determining the maximum theoretical efficiency of a
green leaf, that is to say, the maximum amount of assimilatory work which could

be produced, supposing the conditions so favourable as to admit of the whole of
the energy corresponding to this absorption band being stored up within the leaf.

     It is not without interest to get an approximate idea of this theoretical

maximum.
     For this purpose I havehere reproduced a curve given by Professor S. P. Langley,

representing the distribution of energy at the sea-level in the normal spectrum
of a vertical sun shining in a clear sky. The total amount of incident energy
represented by the whole area of the curve is I'7 calories per square centimetre per
minute, or 1,020,000 calories per square metre per hour.

     I have drawn a thick black vertical band in the red end of the spectrum corre-
sponding in position and breadth with the principal absorption band of chlorophyll

as seen in a green leaf. By integration it may be shown that the area of this part

of the curve is about 6-5 per cent, of that of the whole curve, so that this value

represents something like the theoretical maximum efficiency of a leaf in bright
vertical sunshine, supposing the conditions could be made so favourable as to

' The principal factor which determines the amount of transpiration in a plant

must be the amount of radiation falling on it. It is essential that the water-bearing

mechanism should be able to keep iip a good supply of water to the leaf lamina in

order to prevent the temperature rising to a dangerously high point. This 'safety

valve ' function of the transpiration current is not always sufficiently borne in mind,

.and we are too apt to think that the plant requires these enormous amounts of water

in order to supply itself witli the requisite mineral salts. The absolute necessity for

the supply as a dissipator of energy will become evident by taking one or two facts

Ainto consideration.  square metre of the lamina of the leaf of a sunflower weighs

Weabout 250 grams, and its specific heat is about 0-9.  have seen that the hourly

transpiration in bright sunshine may be as much as 275 c.c. per square metre, re-

quiring the expenditure of 162,800 calories, and it therefore follows that, if the loss

of water were stopped, thetemperatureof the leaf would rise at the ra+e of more than

12° C. per mhiitte. In making our experiments in glazed cases it has sometimes been

very interesting: to watch the result of any accidental stoppage of the water-current

in the leaf-stalk, and the almost instantaneous effect this has in destroying the leaf
when the insolation is of high intensity.

' These limits are those of the band as measured by passing sunlight through the

leaf itself. In an alcoholic solution of chlorophyll the band lies between A 6,400 and

    This maximum efficiency expressed in calories per square metre per hour is

66,300, corresponding to the heat of formation of about 16'o grams of carbo-

hydrate. Under the most favourable conditions we have employed up to the present
we have not obtained a larger production than about 3'0 grams of carbohydrate per
square metre per hour, or about 18 per cent, of the theoretical maximum ; but this
was in air containing only 16-4 parts of carbon dioxide per 10,000, which must be
very far below the true optimum amount.

The brilliant discoveries of recent years on the constitution and synthesis of

the carbohydrates have not brought us sensibly nearer to an explanation of the
first processes of the reduction of carbon dioxide in the living plant. The hypo-

thesis of Baeyer still occupies the position it did when it was first put forward
nearly thirty years ago, although it has, it is true, received a certain amount of
support from the observations of Bokorny, who found that formaldehyde can,
under certain conditions, contribute to the building up of carbohydrates in the

chloroplasts.

    The changes which go on in the living cell are so rapid, and are of such a com-

plex kind, that there seems little or no hope of ascertaining the nature of the first

steps in the process unless we can artificially induce them under much simpler

conditions.

The analogy which exists between the action of chlorophyll in the living plant

and that of a chromatic sensitiser in a photographic plate, was, I believe, first

pointed out by Captain Abney, and was more fully elaborated by Timiriazefl", who

was inclined to regard chlorophyll as the sensitiser par excellence, since it absorbs

and utilises for the assimilatory process the radiations corresponding approxi-

mately to the point of maximum energy in the normal spectrum. The view

which Timiriazefi" has put forward, that there is a mere physical transference

of vibrations of the right period from the absorbing chlorophyll to the reacting

carbon dioxide and water, is, I think, far too simple an explanation of the

facts. Chromatic sensitisers have been shown to act by reason of their antece-

dent decomposition and not by direct transference of energy, and the same

probably holds good with regard to chlorophyll, which is also decomposed by the

Werays which it absorbs.    must probably seek for the first and simplest stages

of the assimilatory process in the interaction of the reduced constituents of the
chlorophyll and the elements of carbon dioxide and water, the combinations so
formed being again split up in another direction by access of energy from

without.

     The failure of all attempts to produce such a reaction under artificial condi-
tions is, I think, to be accounted for by the neglect of one very important factor.

We are dealing with a reaction of a highly endothermic nature, which is

probably also highly reversible, and on this account we cauuot expect any sensible

     Compounds. Opened by Professor H. E. Armstrong, F.R.S.

1. In considering the formation of substitution derivatives from benzene and

allied compounds, it is necessary to account for the very distinct behaviour of

substances containing compound acid radicles {i.e. radicles which in combmation

OHwith  form acids), which yield a large proportion of meta- derivative, whilst

compounds containing other radicles yield ortho- and para-, and little if any

meta- derivative. But no absolute distinction can be drawn, as much depends on

the conditions under which the change takes place, a considerable proportion of

meta- derivative being obtained, for example, from aniline by nitrating it in pre-

sence of a large excess of sulphuric acid.

2. In the case of an amino- compound, it is possible to trace the action through

a series of stages. Thus in sulphonating aniline, the sulphate first undergoes

conversion into sulphamic acid, and this is converted into either ortho- or para-

Bulphonic acid, according to the conditions under which it is placed.

   --3. The process involved in the passage of sulphamic into sulphonic acid may

be regarded as one of isomeric chavye i.e. it may be supposed that the SO3H

group wanders fi-om one part of the molecule to another, without leaving the

system and temporarily entering into some other form of combination.

In favour of this view is the fact that sulphonic acids are produced by

the {iction of a sulphite on nitro- compounds under conditions which render the
                                                                                                                                                                                       :

occurrence of independent sulphonation of the nucleus, to say the least, unlikely
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

it is scarcely pos-^ible to doubt that in such cases the sulphamate is an intermediate

product, as phenylhydroxylamine is converted into phenylsulphamic acid by the

action of sulphur dioxide (Bamberger).

4. The possibility of isomeric change occurring in such a case cannot be

denied in view of the fact that secondary nitrosamines, for example, are converted

into paranitrosamines by the action of acids, and of the many similar cases of

change which have been brought to light in recent years by Bamberger, Hautzsch,

and others.

In many such cases the change is so complete that it is impossible to believe

that the radicle which wanders is first displaced from the molecule, and that the

compound which is formed from it then enters into action with the molecule trom

which it was derived : for example, that in the case of the nitrosamines referred

to the nitroso- group is split off in the form of nitrous acid, which then acts so as

to forma para-nitroso- derivative                                                                                                                                                      or, again, that when pariodo-orthonitrophenetol
                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

is formed on nitrating orthiodophenetol the iodine becomes separated from the

molecule and then attacks it afresh.

Moreover, bearing in mind the extreme readiness with which change takes

place, for example, in the case of the formation of parachloracetanilide from the

compound PhNGlAc, or of sulphanilic from phenylsulphamic acid, it is dilficult

to believe that the formation of the one compound is not a necessary stage in the

i'ormation of the other : the readine-s with which the substituted benzenoid com-

pound is obtained is so great that it is to be expected that both compounds would

be formed together if they were independent products of the action of a single

--agent ^^just as, in fact, often happens in the case of para- and ortho- compounds.

5. It is very diHicult to form any precise conception of the manner in which

such 'isomeric changes' are brought about. Something more than a mere inter-

change of position of the radicles is involved in them : some agent intervenes ; but
the operation of the agent is easily overlooked, fis only a minute quantity suffices

in many cases, the action being ' fermentative ' in character.

G. Very probably the peculiar structure of benzene and the tendency to pass

from the centric to an ethenoid form and back again is the determining cause of

the change                                             maybe  the function of the transforming agent is                                                                                                         to bring  about  the
                                                    ;

cnange from the centric to a highly unstable ethenoid form, and the radicles change

places at the moment that the agent is extruded from the compound and the

Asystem relapses into the centric form.                                                                                                                                                rough parallel is aflTorded by the well-

known game of chairs, in which chairs are provided for all but one of a number of

players                                      at a given signal all rise up                                                                                                             and join their seatless  companions, and  then
                                          ;

at another signal all seek to obtain seats : at this moment players are somewhat

guided in their choice of places by the desire of certain couples to sit together ; even-

tually the seats are again all occupied, but the order of the occupants is different, and

as before one remains out.

7. Only primary and secondary amines can furnish sulphamic acids, and their

formation is necessarily impossible in the case of tertiary amines ; but it can scarcely

be doubted that these are converted in the first instance into a sulphonated

ammonium compound. The formation of o- and/)- dimethylanilinesulphonic acids

from dimethylaniline oxide and sulphur dioxide cannot well be otherwise inter-

preted, and in fact is so formulated by Bamberger

                                                       ]\Ie,PhN(OII). + SO, = Me,PhN(OH). SO3U.

     8. Bamberger assumes that the formation of para-sulphonic acid from sul-
phamic acid is preceded by that of the ortho- acid, but in view of the stability of
the ortho- acid this is improbable ; it is to be expected that it would in a large
measure persist under the conditions which, as a matter of fact, entail the pro-
duction of only the para- acid. Thus, if acetanilide be carefully sulphamated, the
product poured on to ice, and the solution then boiled, only sulphanilic acid is
obtained ; but if the solution of sulphamic acid in sulphuric acid be allowed to
absorb water very gradually at a low temperature, a large proportion of ortho- acid

i§ forujed.
                                                                                             --'

                                                                TlUNSACtlOXS OF SKdTION J!.  Ggo

     Apparently the oi-tho- acid is formed from the sulphamic acid if the sulpho-

group be, as it were, let down gently ; otherwise the para- acid is produced.

    When the ortho- is converted into the para- acid by heating it with sulphuric

acid, probably it is first hydrolysed, and sulphamic acid is then formed, and this in
turn undergoes conversion into para- acid.

9. Whatever the changes involved in the production of ortho- and para- com-

pounds, the nitrogen in amino- compounds clearly exercises both an attractive and

a directive inHuence.

     The nature, and more particulaTly the degree, of its influence depends, in a
remarkable manner, on the nature of its immediate associates ; hydrogen especially
e.xercises an altogether peculiar influence on the course of substitution.

     Nitrogen j)er se has little attractive or directive power, compounds such as
azobenzene and diazobenzene bromide manifesting a singular inertness in presence
of substituting agents ; and it would seem that tlie more the influence of the
hydrogen in amines is counteracted and the basic properties of the nitrogen
neutralised, the more nearly do arainoid compounds generally approximate in

their behaviour to simple azo- derivatives.

    10. But not only does nitrogen cease to be attractive and directive when

deprived of hydrogen and neutralised : it apparently even acquires inhibiting powers.
     Thus dimethylanilinepara-sulphonic acid exchanges only a single atom of

hydrogen for bromine, and the SOJl group is displaced with difficulty by the

further action of bromine. This behaviour is in striking contrast with that oi' sul-
phanilic acid, which is very readily converted into tribromaniline by the mere
addition of bromine to its aqueous solution.

     The effect of acid radicles is even more striking, and somewhat different in
character from that exercised by alkyls : thus when a single molecular proportion
of bromine is added to a solution of acetylsulphanilic acid, less than half the acid is

converted into the monobrominated acid ; a major proportion simply exchanges the
sulphonic group for bromine. Benzoylsulphauilic acid in like manner yields a
mixture of monobrominated acid and parabromobenzanilid.

     The stability of the brominated acid from rf/methylanilinesulphonic acid is

--perhaps accounted for on the assumption that the attack proceeds from the
--nitrogen atom by the fact that it forms a relatively stable dibromide. In the case

of the ???o?i-acetylated acid, on the other hand, it may be supposed that the hydro-

gen in the amino- group is initially displaced, and that the bromine ' wanders out
from this position partly into the ortho- and partly into the para- position.

    11. When the conditions under which meta- derivatives are formed from amines

are considered, it is clear that they are such as to favour the neutralisation of the
basic properties of the amines, and to prevent the displacement of aminoid
hydrogen.

The nitration of aniline in presence of excess of sulphuric acid may be taken as
Aan example.
                                                             _  major proportion of the molecules being present as sulphate, the

access of nitric acid to the azo-radicle, and therefore to the system, is prevented :

consequently no nitramine is formed, and a necessary stage in the formation of both

0- and j9-nitro- derivative is eliminated and their production prevented. On the

other hand, as the action takes place at a low temperature, and nitric acid is

--present in its most concentrated form perhaps, to some extent, as anhydride
the conditions are such as to favour the attack of the benzenoid portion of the

molecule, but only in the meta- position, the ortho- and para- positions being in a

measure protected, owing to the inhibitive influence exercised by the fully saturated

azo-radicle.

    Although the basic properties of aniline are much reduced by the introduction

of acetyl, acetanilid is still sufficiently basic to be attractive of nitric acid, and
it therefore undergoes conversion into nitramine, and subsequently into ortho- and

para-nitro- derivative.

     Benzanilid, being far less basic, is only very partially acted upon in this
manner; the benzenoid portion of the molecule is therefore preferred for attack,
and consequently a considerable number of molecules become meta-nitrated.

Dimethylaniliue is converted entirely into para- acid when sulpbonated by
                                                                                                                                                                                          ::

                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

carefully sulphonated by fuming acid it yields a large proportion of meta- acid.

Doubtless, in this latter case, the conditions correspond to those pictured in the

case of benzanilid undergoing nitration. That the formation of meta- acid is a

consequence of the sulphate undergoing sulphonation, and is not merely due to the

use of the more powerful agent SO3, clearly follows (rom the fact that so powerful

an agent as SO3HCI converts dimethylaniline only into para- acid.

     The behaviour of acetanilid and benzanilid towards fuming sulphuric acid is

--precisely similar to their behaviour towards nitric acid the former gives only 0-

and jO-acid ; the latter a considerable proportion of meta- acid. Probably both are
initially converted into sulphamic acid, but the acid formed from the latter being

less prone to undergo isomeric change it becomes in part meta-sulphonated.

12. In the case of compounds other than amines which afford meta- derivatives,

it may be supposed that the radicle is both unattractive and ' ortho-para inhibitive,'

and that consequently opportunity is given for the attack to become concentrated

upon the benzenoid portion of the molecule in the meta- position.

    As in such cases some proportion of 0- and ;;- compound is usually obtained, it

-- --is necessary to assume if the radicle be regarded as altogether unattractive that
--the benzenoid portion of the molecule is open to attack at several points indeed,

this may be more or less true of all compounds. Thus it may be supposed that

when nitrobenzene is brominated two compounds are initially formed, thus

                          Br

The 1 : 2 compound being a very minor product, but little ortho- compound is
eventually obtained, and owing to the unattractive and inhibitive influence exer-
cised by the NO., group, bromine is chiefly separated from the para- position of the
3 : 4 compound ; consequently but little para- derivative is formed.

     13. The phenols in many ways closely resemble the amines in their behaviour
towards substituting agents. The hydrogen in association with the oxyg>^n clearly

plays an important part ; in fact, the extreme activity of phenols is probably, in
large measure, due to the presence of hydrogen in the extra-benzenoid radicle, as in
the case of the amines, but the part which the hydrogen plays cannot at present

be at all clearly made out.
     By displaciug the hydroxylic hydrogen by alkyIs, effects are produced very

similar to those oliserved in the case of amines. Thus phenol-parasulphonic acid,
like sulphanilic acid, at onre exchanges two atoms of hydrogen for bromine, and

then quite readily exchanges the SO3H group for bromine. But the acids obtained

by introducing methyl, ethyl, or benzyl in place of the hydroxylic hydrogen yield
only monobrominated acids, which on further treatment exchange the SO.5H group
for bromine ; and this action takes place only partially, as a large proportion of the
acid directly exchanges the SO.,!! group for bromine, a monobrominated compound
being formed, just as in the case of acetyl- and benzoyl-sulphanilic acid.

      Benzoyl appears to exercise a very remarkable inhibitive effect, as preliminary
experiments show that benzoylated pheuolparasulpbonic acid remains unattacked
by bromine under conditions which involve the conversion of the unbenzoylated

acid into tribromo-phenol.

     It may therefore be supposed that oxygen in phenols, being possessed of residual

affinity, exercises an influence on substitution similar to that which nitrogen
exercises in amines ; and as it has no basic qualities, it is difficult, if not impossible,
to deprive it of its activity, and consequently of its para-ortho-orienting power
hence it is that phenols do not yield meta- dei-ivatives. Should conditions be dis-
covered which will make it possib'e to hold the activity of oxygen in check, it will
probably be found possible to direct' y prepare meta-phenolic derivatives.

      14. Sulphur, whilst resembling oxygen, apparently has a still stronger inhibitive
             :

                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                         687

influence. Thus phenyl ethyl thio-ether may be para-sulphonated without diffi-

culty, but para-bromo phenyl ethyl thio-ether is not sulphonated either by sulphuric
or by chlorosulphonic acid, although the corresponding oxygen compound is very

readily acted on.

     15. The behaviour of halogen derivatives may be correlated with that of

phenols, or rather with that of their ethers, especially in view of the existence of

compounds such as phenyl iodosochloride PhlClo. On the assumption that the

residual affinity of iodine was satisfied in this compound, it appeared not improbable
that it might furnish a meta-sulphonic acid. It is sulphonated without difficulty,
but the product is highly chlorinated, and its nature has yet to be ascertained.

     The hydrocarbons homologous with benzene are the most difficult group to
discuss. The paraffinyl radicle certainly exercises a directive effect ; w^hether it
is in any way attractive is open to question. Bearing in mind the inactivity of the
paraffins, it is difficult to believe that the radicles derived from them are possessed
of sufficient activity to account for the strildug readiness with which the homologues
of benzene are acted upon in comparison with benzene. The introduction of
hydrogen radicles seems, in fact, to produce a fundamental modification in the

centric complex, the behaviour of hydrocarbons such as mesitylene being ethenoid
rather than benzenoid ; and from this point of view it seems probable that the
derivatives of benzenoid hydrocarbons are formed more in accordance with the
process formulated in paragraph 12.

     16. The fact that when the paraffinyl radicle undergoes chlorination or oxidation,

for example, the attack, as a rule, takes place at the point of attachment, is proof
that, if not itself attractive, it immediately adjoins the centre of attraction ; and it
is possible that initially some change takes place in which both radicles are

involved.

           4. The Relative Orienting Effect of Chlorine and Bromine.

                        By Henry E. Akmsteong, F.R.S.

     The object of this note was to correct a statement made by Armstrong and
Briggs^ that when parachlorobromobenzene is sulphonated only a single acid, viz.
1:4 chlorobromobenzene- 2 sulphouic acid, is produced, not, as was to be expected,

a mixture of this with the isomeric, 1 : 4 chlorobromobenzene-, 3 sulphouic acid.
     Further investigation has shown that the product is actually a mixture of the

two acids. The mistake arose from the fact that corresponding derivatives of the
two acids are isomorphous.

     Experiments made by Dr. E. C. Jee show that metachlorobromobenzene is, in

like manner, converted into a mixture of isomeric acids on sulphonation.

    5. Isomorphism in Benzenesulphonic Derivatives.

     In the course of the work referred to in the previous note, it became necessary

to study the crystallography of the isomeric paracblorobromobenzentj .·iih)honic

acids, and ultimately it was determined to compare with these the analogous acids
derived from dichloro- and dibromo-benzene.

     The sulphouic chlorides and bromides were chosen for examination. Four acids

are obtainable, viz.

    As each of these yields a chloride and a bromide, a series of eight closely allied
compounds can be obtained. The chloride of 1. and both chloride and bromide of

III, have not been prepared in a form fit for measurement, but the remaining five

members of the series have been fully measured by Mr. W. T. Giddeu, and proved

to be isomorphous.

     The 1 : 3 diderivatives of benzene containing halogens should yield three similar
sets of allied sulphonic derivatives, aiz. a 1 : 3 : 4, a 1 : 3 : 5, and a 1 3: 2: set;

1:2:3and the 1 : 2 diderivatives should yield two such sets, a 1 : 2 : 4 and a

series. It is proposed to prepare all these in order to determine their morphological

relationship.

    The 1:3:4 series has already been measured by Dr. E. C. Jee, who has dis-
covered that they form a remarkable isotrimorphous group. No relationship is

apparent between this meta- series and the para- series.

         6, Oxidation in the Presence of Iron.

By Henry J. Hoestman Fentox, M.A.y F.R.S.

The remarkable influence which iron exerts upon the oxidation of certain

organic substances was first pointed out by the autlior in 1876 in the instance of

tartaric acid. This observation has since been fully investigated, and has led to

an extensive study of the behaviour of various other substances uuder similar con-

ditions of oxidation and of the resulting products.^

The peculiar advantage of the method consists in the fact that the extent of

oxidation may be regulated, and consequently that it is often possible to obtain

products of limited oxidation which cannot be prepared in any other way.

Hydrogen peroxide is the most efficient oxidising agent for the purpose,

although others may sometimes be substituted. The iron, which is essential to

the process, must in almost all cases be present in the ferrous condition ; its

proportion, however, bears little if any relation to the yield.

    With regard to the general nature of the oxidation products, it may be ob-

served that in the case of tartaric acid the change may be represented as a removal

of the two non-hydroxylic hydrogen atoms; in the polyhydric alcohols, the
CHOH(primary) CHoOH groups are attacked in preference to the (secondary)
CHOHgroups, whilst "in certain carbohydrates the
                                                      group adjacent to an aldehyde

group appears to be oxidised ; the aldehyde group itself is remarkably resistant.

HIn the benzenoid compounds is usually replaced by OH, and a similar behaviour

would appear to obtain in the furfurane derivatives. In all cases it might be
Hassumed that the initial result is the replacement of
                                                        by OH, tartaric acid, for

example, being supposed to give, in the first instance, trioxysuccinic acid.

The part played by the iron in these changes is still a matter for discussion.

In a previous note * a provisional theory was proposed, in which it was suggested

that the ferrous iron first replaces non-hydroxylic hydrogen and is subsequently

oxidised ; and it is certainly remarkable that in the case of every substance found
to be sensitive to this reaction, non-hydroxylic hydrogen is present, associated

in almost every case with alcoholic hydroxyl.

With a view of throwing further light upon the general nature of this oxida-

tion process, the author is at present studying a variety of substances of typical

--constitution ; and the following is a brief account of results which have recently

been obtained with certain acids :

Tartronic avid gives a large yield of mesoxalic acid. The hydrazone of the

latter acid separates at once on the addition of phenylhydrazine hydrochloride, and

it is probable that the process may be found advantageous for the preparation of

the free acid, especially as the production of tartronic acid has been much simpli-

fied.' This transformation has not hitherto been effected, although the converse

-- --operation the reduction of mesoxalic to tartronic acid is well known.

     Lactic acid, in a similar manner, yields pyruvic acid, but the operation requires

especial care.

     Glyceric acid, when oxidised in the same way, produces a substance having

strong reducing properties, and which gives an intense violet colour with ferric

salts in the presence of alkalis. On treatment with phenylhydrazine acetate an

osazone is produced which crystallises in golden needles, melts at 203°, and gives
a beautifully crystalline sodium salt and pyrazolon. It appears to coincide in every

way with the osazone of oxypyruvie acid Oj^Hj^N^O.j, which was obtained by

Nastvogel from dibrompyruvic acid,- and by \V. Will from the product of the
action of soda on collodion wool.^ The substance produced in the present case

substance would yield oxal-acetic acid, and it is possible that such may be the
result in the first instance, since, on treatment of the product with sulphuric acid,

a certain amount of pyruvic acid is obtained. If, on the other hand, the product
be treated with phenylhydrazine acetate, a substance is obtained which crystallises
in golden prisms, melts at 216°-218°, and gives crystalline sodium and potassium

salts.

     The above-mentioned products are being fully investigated, and the results will

7. Condensation of Glycollic Aldehyde. By Henry J. Horstman Fenton,
                M.A., F.R.S., and Henry Jackson, B.A., B.Sc.

It has been pointed out by one of the authors in previous communications that

tartaric acid, when oxidised in presence of a small quantity of ferrous iron, gives

rise to dioxymaleic acid, C^H^Og ; and that this acid readily decomposes in

aqueous solution, giving glycollic aldehyde, C.II.jOo. This aldehyde has recently

been isolated by the present authors in a crystalline state.* It was further shown '"

that glycoDic aldehyde, when heated to 100°-105° under reduced pressure, under-

goes polymi-risation, giving rise to a true hexose, CgHj^O,;. The condensation

effected in this way is not complete, and the resulting product has to be purified

from the unaltered glycollic aldehyde by treatment with absolute alcohol ; the

yield of the sugar is consequently small, so that further study of its nature was

extremely difficult.

The authors have therefore sought to modify the method of production with a

view to increasing the yield, and have studied the results of effecting the conden-

sation  (1)  at  higher  temperatures                                                     (2) under the influence of alkalis.
                                                                                       ;

If the aldehyde be heated to about 1.30°-140° for a short time, a substance is

obtained whicli dissolves easily in water, but is precipitated as a brownish-white

powder on addition of alcohol ; whereas at a temperature of about 160°-170° a

brown spongy substance is formed, which is nearly insoluble in boiling water, and

on analysis its composition is found to be approximately C^HmOj.

"When an aqueous solution of the aldehyde is mixed with a dilute (1 per cent.)

solution of caustic soda, it begins to turn brown almost immediately. After

standing for about twenty-four hours at the ordinary temperature (about 15°), the

mixture no longer reduces Fehling's solution in the cold, nor answers Schiff's

aldehyde reaction with magenta. The solution now gives with phenylhydrazine a

precipitate consisting of clusters of bright yellow needles, which melt at 158° and

have the composition of a hexosazone OiglljoN^O^. The pure osazone is very
soluble in ethylacetate, sparingly soluble in ether, benzene, and boiling water.
The crystalline form, melting point, and behaviour towards solvents appear defi-
nitely to establish its identity with ^ acrosazone, which was obtained by Fischer
and Tafel from the condensation product of ' glycerose ' by alkalis.

    When calcium hydroxide is employed in place of caustic soda, an exactly

similar result is obtained. After removing the calcium from the solution by exact
precipitation with oxalic acid and evaporating to small bulk at 40° under dimi-
nished pressure, it was dissolved in alcohol, filtered, and then precipitated with
ether. The sugar was thus obtained in the form of white flocks which aggregate
to a pasty solid on standing in a vacuum.

     The properties and configuration of /3 acrose have not hitherto been studied,
owing to the fact that it could not be obtained in quantity unaccompanied by
other sugars ; the authors hope, however, by the present method of preparation to
obtain the sugar in quantity sufficient for a more complete study.

     The formation of a true hexose, and a substance resembling starch and cellu-
lose, from glycollic aldehyde, is of especial interest from its bearing on carbo-
hydrate formation in plants. The remarkable part which a small quantity of ferrous

iron plays as a carrier of atmospheric oxygen in presence of direct sunlight has already
been pointed out : * in the absence of any of these three conditions, the oxidation does

not take place. In plant metabolism these conditions coexist ; this reaction may

not only throw light upon the function of small quantities of iron existing in chlo-

rophyll, but may explain the conversion of tartaric acid, which is so common in

unripe fruits, to the sugars of the mature fruit.

                         8. Some New Silicon Compounds.
                   By Professor J. Emerson Reynolds, F.R.S.

     Some years ago the author communicated to the Section an account of a new
silicon compound of the amidic class having the formula :

                                                    Si(NHPh)^

obtained by complete interaction of silicon haloids with excess of anifine.
     This well-defined crystalline substance when cautiously heated changes in two

stages. In the first stage 1 mol. of aniline is evolved, and crystalline silico-
phenyl-guanidine results,

                                                   /NHPh

                            Si(NHPh)^ = NH.,Ph + Si = NPh

                                                  \NHPh

On further heating another aniline molecule is lost, and a di-imide is obtained
which may also be regarded as diphenyl-silico-cyanimide ; or the latter can be at
once produced from the parent compound

                                Si(NHPh), = Si(NPh), + aNH^Ph.

In the production of the di-imide, which is somewhat soluble in benzene, prolonged
heating leads to molecular rearrangement, and a porcelain-like form of the di-imide

results which is insoluble in benzene. Two modifications of silico-phenyl-di-imide

 exist, just as in the case of the analogous carbon compounds.
      The readiness with which the tetra-amidic compound loses aniline by heat

 suggested the further experiments which were described to the Section, as it
 appeared that the following interaction with a mustard oil should take place

                                                              /NHPh

                        Si(NHPh), + 2EtNCS = Si(NPh),, + 2CS

On mixing in the above proportions in benzene solution no apparent change took

place even on prolonged heating, but the graduated addition of ligroin to the solu-
tion led to the separation of fine long crystals, which are very friable, of the
compound Si(NHPh),,,2EtNC3, and later of another addition compound in
small plates which consisted of Si(NHPh)j,EtNCS, but no trace of the ethyl-

phenyl-urea.

     The solvent benzene was then discarded and the requisite materials were heated

in pressure tubes.

    Up to 140° C. the addition compounds only were produced, but at 1G0° further

change was obtained, and a yellowish fluid mass was produced, which remains a very

viscid liquid at ordinary temperatures, and can be kept in this state for many

months.
     Benzene dissolves the viscid mass, which is reprecipitated in oily droplets, but

no trace of the urea separated. On redissolving in benzene and adding a small

proportion of alcohol to the liquid, decomposition was obtained, and crystals of the

·ethyl-phenyl-urea separated.

      It is evident, then, that the primary interaction anticipated occurs at 160°, but
that the urea formed at once unites with the silico-phenyl-di-imide to form

                                             /NHPh

                                               Si(NPh),,2CS

                                               \NHEt

     This tendency of the silicon amide to unite with urea is similar to that which I
found the Si haloids to possess many years ago, and the very viscid liquid in the
above instance is not unlike the compound SiBrijSCSNHj.NHCjH., which flows
·80 slowly that nearlyamonth is required at ordinary temperatures for the liquid to
·descend from one end of a vertical tube to another.

10. Intermittent Bacterial Treatment of Raio Sewage in Coke-heds.

                   By Professor Frank Clowes, D.Sc.

The above process as originally experimentally carried out by the London County

Council was applied to the effluent from chemical treatment only. The process has

now been applied to raw sewage, screened through coarse gratings. More recent

experience of over twelve months' treatment in beds of varying depth has proved

that when coke fragments of about the size of walnuts are used, the suspended

faecal matter wholly disappears, together with an average of about 50 per cent, of

Athe dissolved organic matter.  further treatment in a second similar bed removes

tin additional 20 per cent, of the dissolved organic matter. It has been found

·sufficient to leave the sewage in contact with the coke for about three hours, and

then to give the coke an exposure to the air in its interstices of about seven hours'

duration.

The depth of the experimental coke-beds has varied from 4 to 13 feet indifferent

experiments, and this variation has in no way affected the degree of purification

effected.

     On no occasion has either the coke or the effluent been foul, nor does the
effluent become foul when it is allowed to stand in either open or closed vessels,

provided that it is not sterilised after it has left the coke-bed.

     The amount of sewage which can be treated by the coke-bed 13 feet in depth,
and with two fillings per day, amounts to three and a half million gallonsper acre.

This amount, however, undergoes gradual reduction, owing to the accumulation in

the filter of matter from the sewage which appears to consist almost wholly of

cellulose. This matter is mainly the chaff derived from the horsedung of the

                                       TT2

 roadways, and from the wear of the wooden paving-blocks of the streets. If the'
 sandy detritus brought down by the sewage in storm weather is allowed to settle-
 before the sewage flows upon the coke-beds, a second process of sedimentation
 removes the larger amount of cellulose matter, and of this latter sediment about
 70 per cent, is combustible when the matter has been dried.

      Hence it appears possible to carry on the solid fsecal matter to the coke-bed,
 and to deal with the sand and cellulose matters by sedimentation, the latter being
 subsequently disposed of by combustion.

      The comparative bacteriological study of the raw sewage and of the effluent by
 Dr. Houston shows that practically no bacterial improvement is brought about by
 the treatment of the sewage in the coke-bed. The presence of bacteria in the

 effluent is, however, advantageous in securing its final purification.

      The effluent has supported the life of tish, which wei-e immersed in it, for
 several months. Their health suffered no appreciable deterioration ; apparently

 they could live in it indefinitely.
      That the coke-beds become fully aerated by the intermittent treatment is

 evident from the fact that after 70 hours' rest in an empty condition the air at the
bottom of the 13-foot bed contained 14'7 per cent, of oxygen and only 0'8 per cent.
of carbon dioxide.

     The above may be accepted as aifording general headings under which the

subject of symbiosis might be treated.

   -- --For the purposes of this discussion, I proceed to consider some special cases,

end limit myself as requested to do to certain aspects of symbiotic fermen-

·tations.

     Several cases of symbiosis among bacteria are now known. Apart from

numerous instances of temporary association between pathogenic micro-organisms
and animals such as earth-worms, rats, flies, ticks, and mosquitoes, and which
disseminate their germs and infect cattle, sheep, horses, and men, reminding us of
the transference of the spores of Botrytis by bees, which carry this parasite with
the pollen and infect the stigmas of bilberries with the parasite ; or which act the
part of intermediate hosts to the disease germs, much as certain pond snails do

to the liver-fluke of sheep, we now know several cases of symbiosis between

two species of bacteria or of fungi, or between a bacterium and a fungus, each
symbiont being incapable of carrying on alone the work which the symbiotic

--association is able to perform a point which is essential to the definition of

symbiosis in the narrower sense, i.e. the co-operation of two associated organs to
their mutual advantage.

   A striking example is aSbrded by certain bacteria concerned in the destruction

of cellulose in ponds, bogs, rivers, &c. Van Senus found that a certain anaerobic
bacterium, resembling, if not identical with. Van Tieghem's B. Amylobacter,
though incapable of dissolving cellulose by itself, can do so if associated with

another bacterium, also incapable of itself attacking cellulose. B. Amylobacter
can ferment pectose compounds, and is thus capable of isolating cells one from
another, but cellulose is not attacked by it.

     Van Senus believed that the one bacillus destroys certain products of fermen-
tation excreted by B. Amylobacter, which inhibit its cellulose-fermenting powers.

     I may remark here, that if a sound potato, rhizome, or other underground

organ is placed in water and the air exhausted as completely as possible, I almost
invariably find its cellulose walls destroyed in a few days by a mixture of bacteria,

and with the symptoms found in many kinds of ' wet rot.' There is no reason to

believe that these organs would rot if merely wet and not deprived of air, since

-- --they lie in ordinary soil- even moist soil for weeks or months, with plenty of

water in their tissues, and respire oxygen, as is well known. The presumption
is that the anaerobic conditions set up in the experiment described favour certain
forms of soil bacteria, such as Van Senus worked with, and enable them to co-

 operate in the destruction of the cell walls.

    An even more remarkable example is given by Winogradsky, who found that

the anaerobic bacterium known as Clostridium Fasteurianum is able, if supplied
694 EEPORT-- 1899.

with abundance of dextrose and protected from the access of oxygen, to fix atmo-

spheric nitrogen. In the cultures, aaid presumably in the soil, the Clostridium

was found to work when protected by a mantle of aerobic bacteria. In fact, the-

nitrogen-fixing Clostridium was working in the meshes of the oxygen-consuming

species, and forming gelatinous flocks like the well-known grains of kephir, or of

ginger-beer plant.

Yet another striking instance of symbiotic association has recently been given

by Omeliansky. In experiments on nitrification at Bonn, the assertion had been

made that the nitrifying organisms, i.e. the bacteria known to oxidise ammonia

to nitrous acid, and nitrous acid to nitric acid, could be grown and made to do

their specific work in media containing proteids or other organic nitrogenous

Nowbodies.      this was directly contradictory of the experience of "VVarington,

"Winogradsky, and other workers, who had found that one great peculiarity of

these nitrifying organisms is that they refuse to grow on such media ; they are in-
capable of using organic nitrogen. Several workers then showed that the Bonn

observers had inadvertently employed mixtures of two or more species, and

Omeliansky undertook a critical investigation of the whole subject, and has put

forward the following explanation of the tangle.

  -- --If Nitrosomonas the bacterium which oxidises ammonia to nitrous acid and
-- --Nitrobacter the bacterium which further oxidises nitrous to nitric acid be sown

together or separately on a medium containing organic nitrogen, no growth or

change occurs.

But if a bacterium capable of decomposing the organic nitrogenous medium,

e.g. Bacillus rajnosus, is added to the above-mentioned Nitrosomonas and Nitro-

bacter, the associated three organisms are able to carry out all the processes and

complete the cycle of nitrification. That is to say, B. ramosus breaks down the

gelatine and ammonia is formed, this is then oxidised to nitrous acid by Nitroso-

monas, and the nitrous acid is further oxidised to nitric acid by the Nitrobacter.

If B. ramosus and Nitrosomonas only are sown together, then only nitrous acid

is formed, because the latter organism is only capable of carrying the oxidation

the one stage.

If B. ramosus and Nitrobacter only are used, then only ammonia is formed,,

because the latter organism cannot oxidise ammonia.

    If we try to imagine the working of this association of organisms in the soil,

and bear in mind the frequent co-existence and action of the de-nitrifying bacteria
which Gayon and Dupetit, Giltay and Abersou, Waringtou and others have

familiarised us with, a glimpse is obtained of the very complex symbioses

which may be concerned in the circulation of nitrogen in Nature. Moreover,

some of these de-nitrifying bacilli appear to be anaerobic, and can only work in

the surface soil if protected from the access of oxygen ; say, by an associated

aerobic bacterium.

Another interesting case is the following. Perdix a few years ago isolated

from water an anaerobic bacterium which converts starches into sugars, which

with the aid of a yeast can be fermented, the whole process going on in association.

Other cases of symbiotic associations of bacteria exist among the forms con-

cerned in the reductions of sulphates and the oxidation of sulphuretted hydrogen,

the iron bacteria, &c. ; but I propose to mention only one or two further examples,

taken from the true fungi.

Symbiotic associations of fungi are probably common, but only a few cases are

as yet established, and these principally among the ferment-fungi.
     Van Laer has called attention to the symbiotic co-existence of two yeasts in

many beers, explaining certain peculiar after-fermentations as due to the action of

one yeast acting on the medium improved for it by the other.
     The Japanese have long been in the habit of brewing a pecuUar fermented

liquor known as rice-wine, or salu?. Rice grains are steamed, and when cool are

infected with a mould fungus now known as Aspergillus Oryzm. When the rice

is quite mouldy, at which time it emits a peculiar odour like that of pineapples,

the starch is found to be rapidly turning to sugar, under the action of a diastatic
enzyme secreted by the fungus.
   --

   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  695

      This decomposing rice is then placed in water and exposed to the action of a
yeast, which rapidly ferments the sugar, and the alcoholic sak6 results.

      So closely is the yeast associated with the Aspergillus, that, in practice, the
alcoholic fermentation commences soon after the enzyme of the Aspergillus begins
to hydrolyse the starch of the rice, and for some time a controversy existed as to
whether the yeast was not really part of the life-history of the Aspergillus. Several

observers have now shown, however, that we have here a striking case of symbiosis.
     On reviewing these examples, we shall find that very different degrees of associa-

tion of the organisms are to be met with.
     At the one end of the series we find two organisms merely associated for a

short time, e.g. bacilli and worms, bees and botrytis-spores, and, so far as we may

.speak of symbiosis at all in these cases, it is merely temporary or disjunctive.

     At the other end of the series we have a close permanent combination of the
two organisms working in unison, e.g. the lichens and Winogradsky's Closterium

with its protective mantle of aerobic bacteria; also the ginger-beer plant and

kephir.

     But between these extremes it is possible to find all stages, the halfway house
being met with in cases such as the sak6 ferment, where the Aspergillus evidently
prepares the way for the Yeast.

     It has been proposed to apply the term Metabiosis to such cases.
     It must not be forgotten that there are extremes in the other direction,
where one of the two associated organisms is injuring the other, as exemplified by

many parasites, but these cases I leave out of account here. This state of afiaira

has been termed Antibiosis.

     It seems not impossible that the biological relationships of these cases one to

another could be shown thus :

                                 Antibiosis.

actions are frequently poisons, and we all know of cases where such poisonous
excreta of living cells act as stimuli to other living cells, if supplied to them in

minimal doses and very gradually : I need only instance the eflects of tobacco or
alcohol on man, in illustration of this.

     Several observers have shown that in presence of a particular food-substance
the living cell is stimulated to produce and excrete a particular enzyme, while the
substitution of another food stimulates the organism to excrete a totally different
enzyme.

    Now let us see if there is any evidence to support the hypothesis that some

such stimulative action is exerted by one symbiont on another. To a certain
extent we find such in the remarkable vigour and large size of the algal cells in a
lichen as compared with the same cells living an independent life, and in the
persistent zone of brilliant green and often hypertrophied cells of leaves in which
certain fungi are living, the gigantic cells of the nodules on leguminous roots in
which the bacteroids are living, and many other cases ; but since it is impossible
to say how far these are cases of merely enhanced nutrition, we will pass them by
and seek for other instances.

    One of the earliest I can find is Hugo Schulz's demonstration in 1888 that

minute quantities of poisons such as corrosive sublimate, iodine, iodide of potas-
sium, bromine, arseuious acid, chromic acid, sodium salicylate, or formic acid,

when added to yeast in 10 per cent, grape-sugar solution, immediately raise the

--fermentative activity of the organism as measured by the amount of carbon-

dioxide evolved. Etfront, in 1894, showed that hydrofluoric acid acts similarly on
yeasts, butyric ferments, ,ind inycoderma, and, later, that the same is true of

formaldehyde, salicylic acid, picric acid, &c.

     What looks like another case in point is Johannsen's results of experiments

with seeds, buds, &c., treated with ether or chloroform : respiration is increased,
and the whole course of metabolism so altered that in some cases buds of flowers
can be stimulated to open long before their normal period.

     The results obtained by Farmer and Waller with carbon-dioxide, which was
found to induce an initial acceleration of the movement of the protoplasm in
Elodea, may be a further instance.

  --Pfefier has recently called attention to a still more remarkable instance that

it is possible by etherising the living cells of Spirogyra to alter the type of nuclear
division from mitotic (indirect) to a-mitotic (direct). Massart had shown that
callus, the hypertrophied tissue developed under stimulation by mites, fungi,
exposure to air, &c., is formed of cells which divide with a-mitotic nuclear division

and other cases occur. But it is even more to the point for my purpose that

Gerassimoff', in Pfefter's laboratory, found Sjn'roffi/ra driven to a-viitotie division
by associated bacteria and other organisms, which he regards as a case of

symbiosis.

    Now it may be regarded as certain that if a cell can be thus stimulated to

alter the details of so fundamental and complex a morphological process as its
cell-division by the action of associated organisms, the metabolic activities of its
protoplasm are being driven into very difl'erent channels from the normal, and

many physiological processes must be affected.
    Of course I am here raising questions which concern the border-line between

health and disease, and much investigation is still required as to the meaning of

these matters ; but I ought to add that according to Pfefi"er the etherised cells can
be again restored to their normal state if the traces of anaesthetic are washed out,
and those familiar with Kleb's experiments on other algffi will appreciate the
significance of this one with Spirogyra.

     However feeble the evidence may be, we can at l(;ast say, then, that there is
some evidence in support of the hypothesis that one symbiont may stimulate

--another by excreting some body which acts as an exciting drug to the latter ^just

as truly as certain drugs act as stimulants to some cell or organ of a higher
animal, and no doubt in a fundamentally similar manner. It will be noted that
such drugs are frequently excreta from vegetable cells.

    But there is another, perhaps more indirect way in which one symbiont may
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                         697

eiiliance the activity of another. It has long been known that the accumulation

of the products of metabolism of a cell tend to inhibit the activity of that cell,

and that if by any means we can destroy or remove the metabolite as it is formed,

the cell concerned can go on working. Similarly with ferments, and even with

enzymes, the .accumulation of the products gradually inhibits the action as

Tammann showed in the case of amygdalin and emulsin, and Brown and Morris

uud Lea in the case of starch and diastase, to mention two illustrations only.
ANow suppose we have two organisms
                                    and B living in symbiosis, and

Asuppose tliat is capahle of hydrolysing starch by the excretion of diastase, while

B removes the product of hydrolysis, by fermenting the sugar as fast as it is
Aformed ; in this case there is every reason to expect that
                                                             will complete its

Ahydrolysing action to the utmost, not only hecause it is of advantage to to be

relieved of the inhibiting sugar, but because the diminution of the sugar reacts as

a stimulus to the secretion of more enzyme.
     There is yet another point to he considered. Katz, in 1898, published some

results confirming in many points the discoveries of Wortmann, Brown and

Morris, and others, that fungi, bacteria, embryos, and other enzyme secreting
organisms not only vary the extent and kind of enzyme secreted, but can be

stimulated to vary the enzyme according to the quantity or quality of food materials

.at hand.

     I think this line of enquiry may lead to results in the present connection, as it

Ais obvious that the products of fermentation of an organism must be favourable,

or without etfect, or deleterious to the action of another, B, in its immediate neigh-

bourhood. Moreover, it is shown that a product which is, per se, devoid of either

favourable or deleterious action, may acquire one or the other if the concentration

.increases.

Katz regards the action of sugars as not a purely chemical one, but as a

physiological stimulus ; and without pretending to understand the distinction iu

detail, we may admit the importance of the experimental facts, and not only seek

for, but also hope for, more light.
     Here, then, is a brief sketch of some of the salient features of symbiosis, and of

some of the physiological factors concerned in the processes ; and though it is far

from exhaustive, it may serve our purpose to-day of starting a discussion, and of

showing some lines along which further investigation is desirable.

Note sur les Fermentations Symhiotiqiies Industrielles. Par Monsieur le

        Docteur A. Calmette, Directeur cle I'Institut Fasteur de Lille.

     On sait que beaucoup de champignons inf^rieurs s'accommodent tres bien de la

vie en symbiose soit avec des bacti^ries, soit avec d'autres champignons ou avec des

algues, soit avec des veg^taux ou des animaux superieurs. On a 6tudi6 dans ces
derniers temps un tres grand nombre d'especes cryptogamiques parasites. Ces
especes parasites ne nous occuperont pas ici. Nous n'envisagerons que I'^tude de

quelques phycomycetes et mycomycetes qui \4vent ordinairement en saprophytes sur
Ics substances organiques les plus diverses et font subir a celles-ci des transforma-
tions que I'homme a pu utiliser pour les besoins de ses industries.

      Les champignons qui nous int&essent surtout sont ceux qui fermentent les
matieres hydrocarboniSes, telles que la cellulose, I'amidon, les dextriues, les sucres,
les tannins, ou les matieres azotees, telles que la cas(5ine dulait.

     Ces champignons agissent sur ces substances au moyen des diastases qu'ils

sdcretent et qui presentent des propri^t^s tres voisines de celles que possedent les
v6getaux superieurs et les animaux, pour I'assimilation des aliments que ceux-ci

puisent dans le monde exterieur.
      Chose tres remarquable, plusieurs de ces etres ont la facult6 de produire

les diastases les plus diverses, suivant la nature des substances qui doivent leur servir
d'aliments. C'est ainsi qu'une des muc^din^es les plus vulgaires, le PenicUlium
glaucum, est capable de si5cr6ter tantot de I'amylase, tantot de la sucrase, si on la
698 REPORT--1899.

fait croitre sur des milieux renfermant de I'amidon ou du saccharose, tantot de la
presure et de la casSase, si elle se d^reloppe sur du lait.

      Dans Leaucoup de cas, la croissance de ces v^g^taux inferieurs et la sdcr^tion de
leurs diastases s'arretent dans les mUieux nutritifs ou lis ont V(5cu un certain temps,
alors meme que ces milieux sontloin d'etre ^puis^s, parce que lesproduits de trans-
 formation de la matiere organique auxquels ils ont donn^ naissance deviennent
toxiques pour eux-memes. On sait par exemple que les Saccbaromyces cessent de

 fermenter le sucre lorsqu'ils se trouvent en presence d'une certaine proportion

d'alcool. De meme, certains mucors et certains aspergillus qui hydrolisent 6nergi-
 quement I'amidon, cessent de saccbarifier celui-ci, des que le milieu dans lequel ils
se d^veloppent renferme ime certaine quantity des produits qu'ils ont fabriqu^Si,

eucres, acides ou alcools.
      Lorsque ces etres se d^veloppent spontan^ment dans les milieux organiquea

fermentescibles par exemple sur un fragment de pomme de terre plac6 dans des

-- --conditions favorables d'bumidit^ et de temperature il arrive souvent que d'autres

etres, bactdries ou moisissures, dont les fonctions sont difKrentes, ne tardeut pas a
 s'6tablir a cotS d'eux et collaborent aussitot a I'oeuYre de degradation mol(5culaire
commenc^e par le premier occupant. Nous verrons, par exemple, la Sclerotinia
libertiana s'installer tout d'abord et attaquer, grace a la cytase et a I'acide
oxalique qu'elle secrete, la mince enveloppe de cellulose qui entoure les grains

d'amidon.
      Bientot, ceux-ci, mis a nu, deviendront une proie facile pour les nombreuses

mucedin&s saccharifiantes, mucor ou aspergUlus, et au fur et a mesure que
I'amylase de ces dernieres transforme I'amidon en sucre, ce dernier trouve immedi-
atement d'autres etres qui s'en emparent, soit pour le bruler, soit pour en faire de
I'alcool et de I'acide carbonique. L'alcool lui-meme ne tarderapas a rencontrer des
cellules de mycodermes ou de myco-levures qui se chargeront de I'oxyder, d'en
faire de I'acide ac^tique, ou tout simplement de I'acide carbonique et de I'eau.
Et par cette s^rie de degradations successives produites par nos champignons

inferieurs, le fragment de pomme de terre initial aura completement disparu.

      L'etude scientifique de ces faits devait naturellement sugg^rer aux biologistes
I'idee d'utiliser, en les associant, les propriety que possedent certains champignons
inferieurs ou certaines bacteries de fermenter les substances hydro-carbonees ou

azotees.

     Nous n'avions qu'a prendre exemple sur les pratiques de certains peuples de
I'ExtrSme Orient qui utilisent depuis un temps immemorial des moisissures pour
fabriquer de l'alcool avec le riz. Les Japonais fabriquent leur Sake avec un
aspergillus decrit depuis 1879 par Ahlburg sous le nom d'Eurothim orizoe ; les
Chinois et les Javanais preparent leurs eaux-de-vie et leurs tLds de riz au moyen

d'un mucor, dont les proprietes saccharifiantes tres energiques ont ete mises en
evidence par moi-meme, a Saigon en 1892, puis par Prinsen Geerligs, a Java en
1894.

     Ces diverses mucedinees saccharifiantes, aspergillus ou mucor, dont il existe un
tres grand nombre de varietes, possedent, pour la plupart, la proprietd de fermenter

les sucres, lorsqu'elles sont placees dans certaines conditions de vie anaerobie.
Toutefois, leurs proprietes fermentatives sont presque toujours beaucoup moins
developpees que leurs proprietes saccharifiantes, et, lorsqu'elles agissent sur I'amidon
pour transformer celui-ci en alcool, elles s'associent toujours spontanement a des
levures alcooliques, c'est-a-dire a des saccbaromyces vrais.

     Ces moisissures s'accommodent parfaitement de la vie symbiotique avec les
levures, et si on a soin de les eduquer, de les employer en cultures pures et de ne
les mettre en presence de cultures pures de levures que lorsque les mucedinees ont
dej^ pris possession du milieu et ont commence leur travail de saccharificatioD, on
les utilise dans des conditions beaucoup plus parfaites que ne le font les peuples

orientaux qui les emploient. On pent faire en sorte, par exemple, que les
saccbaromyces s'emparent au fur et a mesure du glucose elabore par les moisissures,

et celles-ci efl'ectuent alors plus activement leur travail parce qu'elles ne sont pas
genees dans leur developpement par leurs produits de secretion. Elles ne cessent
de saccbarifier I'amidon que lorsque la quantite d'alcool resultant de la fermenta-

tion du Sucre dans le mout est suffisante pour contrarier leurs S(3cr6tion3

diastasiques.

    La symbiose des muc^dinees saccliarifiantes et des levures permet d'efFectuer
industriellement la fermentation directe de I'amidon des grains ou des pommes de
terre et de supprimer a, pen pres totalement I'emploi du malt ou des acides pour la

saccharification en distillerie.

     Ce principe de la symbiose s'6tendra probablemeat dans I'avenir k la fabrica-
tion de beaucoup d'autres substances que I'industrie prepare aujourd'hui pour ses

besoins.

               Symbiotic Ferraentatio7t, : its Chemical Aspects.

                   By Professor H. E. Armstrong, F.R.S.

     1. It is open to question whether the establishment of symbiotic relationships

--involves more than a subdivision of Ifibour whether the associated organisms

combine in carrying the chemical change through any one phase.

    2. There is an absence of positive evidence tending to show that the one member
of a pair of symbiotic organisms or agents does more than prepare the way for the

other by effecting a change which the second is incapable of inducing, leaving it to

Athe second to carry on changes in which the initiating organism plays no part.

rough parallel to the case here contemplated would be that afforded by the

occurrence of lactic followed by butyric fermentation under the influence of

distinct organisms. These are strictly independent and sequent phenomena, Ih©

one change apparently setting in only when the other is complete.

3. In symbiotic fermentation, however, the two sets of changes seem at least to

run parallel.

4. It may be a function of the one organism to remove from the sphere of

action, as it arises, a product which would tend either to inhibit the change by

which it is formed or to promote its reversal.

    5. Or the one organism may produce a change which, although minute, is

sufficient to place the companion organism under the most favourable conditions.

For example, a minute proportion of acid favours the hydrolysis of cane sugar by

invertase. Hence it may be supposed that in a neutral or faintly alkaline solution

yeast would ferment sugar only slowly, if at all, whilst if associated with an

organism capable of producing, say, a minute proportion of lactic acid, it would act

Arapidly.      case apparently of symbiosis, which possibly comes within this

definition, is that referred to by Marshall Ward as studied by Van Senus.

6. Or, again, the one organism may become associated with the hydrolyte, and

thus shield or mask a particular ' centre ' in it, thereby making it possible for the

second organism to actively affect the molecules at other centres. This case

corresponds to the removal of a ward from a lock, and the consequent possibility

of using a simpler key. What is in some cases a more nearly exact parallel is

afforded by the production of glycuronic acid by the oxidation of the compound of

COHglucose with chloral: in glucose, the  centre is super-attractive to most

oxidising agents, but when this centre is masked the attack is transferred to the

opposite CH,,(OH) group.

7. Another case is considered subsequently (§ ii.).
8. Fermentation is certainly at bottom a process of hydrocatalysis, and it can

--scarcely be doubted that the function of the enzyme is to introduce water into the

circuit of change in fact, to establish a circuit in which hydrolytic changes can

occur, although not of the ordinary kind, but reductive on the one hand and oxida-

tive on the other.

9. Hence we may speak of the substance fermented as the hydrolyte, of the

ferment as the hydrolyst, and of the products of hydrolysis as the hydroschists.

10. It is more than probable that the products ordinarily obtained are but end

products of a series of changes, and that only some of these are enzymic, whilst

others occur, as it were, naturally, and are partly analytic and partly synthetic in

character. Thus, in the formation of the inactive amyl alcohol in fusel oil, it may
                                                                                                ;

700 REPORT--1899.

be supposed that glucose is resolved hy fermentation into a mixture of glyceraldose

and glyceroketose, which spontaneously interact forming a new hexose,

                   HO.H,,C CH,,.OH

                         \/
                               C.OH
                              CH.OH

                               COH,

:and that this in turn becomes fermented to isohutylcarhinol, Sec. It is not even

kno wn whether fusel oil is a product of fermentation by pure yeast ; still less, therefore,
can it be decided whether the two successive fermentations here contemplated are
the acts of one organism, or of organisms which are in any sense symbiotic. But

it seems almost certain that one and the same organism can produce a variety qf

changes.

    11. It is conceivable that two symbiotic, organisms may so act that the one pro-

duces a substance A, the other a substance B, and that these products interact,

forming a third substance ; and that the two organisms attack either one and the
same substance, or different substances. In such a case the fermentation would be

different from that produced by either organism singly. Such would be a case of

truest symbiosis.

12. The conversion of lactic into butyric acid, of glycerol into butanol, and the

formation of fat are certainly cases of fermentations in which synthetic changes

cccur, and it may well be apart from euzymic action.

13. There is little doubt that the importance of the part played by synthetic

changes in fermentations, especially in the case of nitrogenous compounds, is at

present far from being appreciated.

     14. But however many steps may be involved in some fermentations, at least

the attack on several centres must be simultaneous, and must occur in one and the

same circuit, as the change involves expenditure of energy at some centres, and this

AEiust be supplied from those others at which energy is developed.                              complex

carbohydrate molecule undergoing fermentation may, in fact, be compared with a

series of voltaic cells of unequal electromotive force in series. It is difficult in

any other way to account for the resolution of a single molecule into so many

others, such as occurs, for example, in ordinary alcoholic fermentation.

     15. Such simultaneous attack is possible, probably because the enzyme is so con-

stituted that it can attach itself  at several points  along the  chain                         the hydrolyte,
                                                                                             ;

in fact, is comparable with a complex lock, the hydrolyst with a complex key.

It is possible thus to picture contact as being established between several more or

less distant centres in a complex molecule, and a ' ripple of change ' as pervading
the system in consequence. Enzymes with restricted powers, such as invertase

and diastase, probably can attach themselves only to a single centre, and their

action is directly and simply hydrolytic.

     16. In some cases, such as the formation of fat, it would seem necessary to sup-

pose that several molecules may become associated together through the agency of
the hydrolyst, so that reductive processes may go on almost entirely in the one set

whilst in another corresponding oxidative processes take place, which furnish the

energy required to effect the reductions. On the other hand, it is conceivable that

Gxygeu directly intervenes in the formation of fat, and that the process is not

merely one of hydrocatalysis.

17. That no very complex mechanism is needed to produce effects such as are

believed to be involved in fermentations follows from the fact that dextrose, for

example, may be resolved into lactic acid by digestion with alkali and levulose

into levulinic acid, CH3.00.0H,,.CH,,.C00H, by heating it with an acid, the

latter being an especially remarkable case.

18. If the phenomena are as suggested, it does not seem probable that true

symbiotic fermentation is likely to occur as a consequence of the simultaneous

attack of a single molecule by several organisms ; rather is it probable that                                   4
sssociated molecules undergo change under the influence of a single organism or
                                                                                                                              ;

agent -which determines their association. And hitherto apparent!}' no case has
been met with in which a substance has been observed to give way to a pair of

organisms, neither of which can attack it singly.

19. The assimilation of nitrogen by plants, which is believed to take place in tha

symbiotic growths found on the roots of the Leguminosre, is a phenomenon of which

at present no explanation can be given, as this element cannot enter into combina-

tion with either hydrogen or oxygen unassisted ; its absorption must take place in

a circuit in which changes occur from which the necessary energy maybe derived.

As hydrogen is liberated in many fermentations, it appears not improbable that

nitrogen may be  brought  into  circuit  by  acting  as  a  hydrogen  depolariser                                             one
                                                                                                                           ;

function of the nodule may be to supply carbohydrate, which is fermented by the

bacteroid in circuit with the nitrogen.
     20. Symbiosis, as distinguished from parasitism, involves the conception not

address to the Chemical Society in 1895.' Green, in his recent work on Enzymes^

speaks of Baeyer having put forward, in 1870, the hypothesis that fermentation
is due to electric hydrolysis. This is incorrect. Baeyer's paper is entitled ' Ueber

die Wasserentziehung und ihre Bedeutung fiir das Pflanzenleben,' &c. He makes

no reference whatever to the manner in which water might be withdrawn, but

merely shows that the withdrawal of water and the subsequent addition of its-

elements in a diiferent order would produce effects such as are observed in.

there is no combined work because all the agents do not simultaneously attack the
same material. There is an evident need, however, of defining the sense in which
the term Symbiosis is used : at present it is applied to a number of distinct
cases. It will be well to follow Professor Marshall Ward's proposal, and to limit

the use of the term to those cases in which each living organism is essentially

benefited by the work of its companion, so that joint life is needed for the welfare

Bof both. Cases in which prepares material for A, but derives no essential benefit
from A, should be termed, as Professor Ward suggests, not Symbiosis, but

Metabiosis.

Mr. Francis Darwin spoke on stimulus as a factor in the problem, and, -without

dissenting from Professor Ward's view, called attention to a possible difficulty.
     Dr. G. Harris Morris said that he was interested in the subject under dis-

cussion from the point of view of the so-called symbiotic fermentations, in which
moulds and yeasts were concerned. Personally he considered the view of Pro-

fessor Armstrong-, that the first-named organism prepared the way for the second,

to be the correct one, and he thought that the results of certain experiments which
he hoped to lay before the Section at a later meeting (see p. 710) would support
that view. In the fermentations referred to, the function of the mould appeared
to be entirely that of secreting diastase, which degraded the starch products and
rendered them fermentable by the yeast. The diastase thus secreted could be
replaced by malt extract or precipitated diastase with precisely the same result,
and although the diastase so secreted or added was undoubtedly stimulated by the

fermentative action of the yeast, yet the phenomenon could not be regarded as an

Ainstance of true symbiosis.  further proof that the one organism prepared the

way for the other was to be found in the fact that in the commercial process

·which had been mentioned it was found that the best results were obtained when

the mould, or diastase secretor, was added twenty-four hours before the yeast or

fermentative agent.

     The results of the experiments to which he had previously referred showed the
supposition that the function of one organism was to remove from the field of

action products which inhibited the action of the other to be untenable.

    He should also like to correct the view, which appeared to be shared by some

who had taken part in the discussion, that because the moulds were only able to

produce a comparatively small amount of alcohol, therefore their saccharifying
action ceased when the formation of alcohol came to an end. This was by no
means the case, as experiment showed that the extent to which degradation of the
starch-products had proceeded was by no means indicated by the amoimt of

alcohol formed.

    He also could not agree with Professor van Laer in regarding the action of the

yeast as that of a parasite, and he did not think that any analogy could be drawn
with the action in question and that of Mycoderma vini.

   --[The President of the Section. It is a matter of great difficulty to determine

all the actions and reactions of an organism with its environment even when we
have to deal with a pure culture living in a medium of the simplest possible
composition, but the difficulty is enormously increased when it is a question of two

or more organisms, either of which can influence the other in a variety of ways.
     If we consider the process of Dr. Oalmette for the preparation of alcohol from

starch by the metabiotic agencies of a saccharifying Amylomycete or Aspergillus,

and a true yeast, we find that the actual amount of hydrolytic action exerted by
the first organism when working alone is extremely small, but that the mere

presence of a second organism, the yeast, which has the power of fermenting the pro-

ducts of starch-hydrolysis as fast as they are formed, enormously intensifies the

initial saccharification. The fact is generally explained by biologists by assuming

that the yeast in some mysterious manner stinmlates the saccharifying organism to

secrete a larger amount of diastase. This explanation is a pure assumption which

Wecannot be proved or disproved by direct experiment.  may, however, as

Dr. Morris has shown, produce the same effect under conditions where the

saccharifying organism is replaced by a small but definite amount of diastase

which remains constant throughout the experiment. Now it is impossible to

avoid the conclusion that the chemical processes involved are the same in the two

cases, and that it is perfectly unnecessary to introduce the explanation of an

increased secretion of diastase by stimulation when we are considering the case in

which the two metabiotic organisms are concerned.

    An extension of similar work, especially on the simultaneous action of mixed

enzymes, each one of which is capable of carrying out its own stage of hydrolysis,

will, no doubt, ultimately throw considerable light on the metabiotic effect of living
organisms. Take, for instance, the case of diastase and glucase. The former can
hydrolyse starch down to maltose but no further, whilst the latter, unable in itself
----

to act on starch, can readily convert maltose into glucose. It ia highly probable, if
these enzymes were set to work side by side on starch, that the joint hydrolytic
effect, measured by the amount of starch which disappears in a given time,
would be greater than it would be if the diastase were working alone.

    Two possible explanations of the increased effect of the presence of yeast on a

trace of diastase naturally suggest themselves. The first is that the hydrolytic
process is a reversible one, and is promoted by the rapid removal of the products
from the sphere of action, the other being that the small amount of acid produced

durin<T the alcoholic fermentation increases the action of the diastase. Dr. Morris
has apparently eliminated both these possibilities, in the one case by artificially

adding maltose to the solutions, and in the other by the addition of a fermented

malt-extract deprived of its living yeast cells.

     If, however, it is remembered that maltose, when first formed by diastatic
action, unquestionably differs from the optically stable form which has been in
solution for some time, and, moreover, that evidence is still wanting as to the
relative fermentability of these two forms of maltose, the door is not altogether
closed to the possibilities of the phenomena being after all in some way
dependent on the prevention of reversal by the rapid removal of the fermentable

products of change.] ^

     Dear Sir,--In response to your letter of June 8, 1 take pleasure in sending you

a statement of my views relative to the proposed International Committee upon
Atomic Weights. The suggestions which I have to offer are, however, only my

own individual opinions, and are not to be regarded as representing any organisa-
tion, or as based upon any definite programme. Still, they may serve as a basis
for discussion, and so help to clear a way for progress.

     Every chemist who has studied, with any closeness, the determination of atomic
weights, has noticed the discordance which exists among the published tables. In
many text-books and works of reference tables are given which seem to have been
·edited with a pair of scissors and a paste-pot, and which show about as much
critical acumen in their making up as those useful implements could furnish. Not

only are obsolete values found persisting, but values are given which are inconsis-
tent among themselves ; and occasionally there is evidence of the most pitiable
confusion as to the fundamental standards of reference. One table is based upon
the standard of oxygen as 16 ; another upon oxygen as 15'88, and still others upon
the wholly erroneous ratio of 15'96. In one and the same table these several

the termination of the Discussion. The remarks in square brackets embody the
views expressed by the President of Section B at a subsequent date, when Dr. G. H.

standards may simultaneously appear, one atomic weight teing referred to one, and'

another to another ; the compiler being quite unconscious of the discrepancy.

Tables of atomic weights which were good ten years ago reappear frequently in

books of to-day, with no hint that any changes haTS occurred in any of the data.

     In order to remedy, at least in part, this unnecessary confusion in our funda-

mental constants, the American Chemical Society in 1892 requested me to prepare
an annual report upon atomic weights. Each year since I have submitted to the
Society such a report (six in all), giving a summary of the determinations made,
and a table of values brought down to the date of publication. So far as it went,

the work seems to have been useful ; but it did not go far enough, and it carried
only the authority which might attach to the opinions of a single individual. More

criticism, more comparison of views among chemists, was evidently desirable ; and
the movement in favour of international action seems to be a movement in the

proper direction.

In 1898 the subject was taken up independently by the German Chemical

Society, which appointed a committee consisting of Landolt, Ostwald, and Seubert.

This committee in due time reported a table of atomic weights, recommended the

adoption of = 16 as the standard of reference, and suggested that like committees

might well be appointed by other societies for purposes of co-operation. Acting

upon that suggestion, the American Chemical Society, at its last general meeting,

appointed a committee consisting of F. W. Clarke, J. W. Mallet, E. W. Morley,

T. W. Richards, and Edgar F. Smith ; and that committee has already begun
Acorrespondence with the English and German organisations.
                                                                                                                                                                           number of local

societies in various parts of Europe have recommended the use of the table put forth

by the German committee; but a full conference of all the parties at interest is yet

to be held. Probably an effort will be made to discuss the atomic weight question

at the Congress of Chemists in Paris next year ; but this proposition is so far only

a matter under consideration. At all events, a general international committee

might then be most readily brought together ; and its recommendations would

certainly carry much weight.

What, now, could such a committee accomplish ? In what directions should

its influence be exerted ? These are questions to be answered beforehand, for upon

the answers the expediency of definite action must depend. Unless we have a

reasonable expectation that something useful can be done, it is not worth whQe to

go any farther.

    Two lines of discussion for the proposed committee are self-evident : first, a

Hdiscussion of the ultimate standard of reference, whether it shall be = 16 or = 1

and upon this question there are legitimate difl'erences of opinion ; secondly, a

discussion of the existing data, in order to determine the most probable values for

the atomic weights, and to get some insight into their relative accuracy. This

involves the preparation of a table of atomic weights for practical use, in which

some indication shall be given as to the trustworthiness of the individual values.

Which figures have been well determined, and which need correction, should be

clearly shown, and in that way future investigation would be stimulated. Such a

table would call for revision from time to time, perhaps annually, and for this

reason the committee should be made a permanent body, to act either by meeting

or by correspondence, according to circumstances. Only an international com-

mittee could expect to have its findings generally accepted.

    Up to this point the work proposed for the committee has already been done,

with more or less thoroughness, by the German committee, by Professor Richards,

and by myself; so that the ground is pretty well cleared, and the field of action

can be seen.  But still more is desirable                                                                                                                        and just  here, I believe, the  task of the
                                                                                                                                                              ;

proposed committee may become most important. Having ascertained the weak

points in our system of atomic weights, the next thing to do is to have them

strengthened ; and to this end the combined influence of a body of trained experts

might well be exerted. At present all research in this field of investigation is^

by sometimes several independent workers, while other equally important questions

research, tuight ·easily be brouglit about; not by any exercise of authority on the

part of the committee, but by mutual consent of the investij^ators, working in con-

-ference, and aided by the suggestions which the international body might develop.

In short, the committee could not order, but it might persuade ; and in this direc-

tion its influence ought to be decidedly beneficial. Even if it did no more than to

point out the es-sential problems to be solved, it would fully justify its e.xistence.

     There is one more general problem which the proposed committee should

consider: that of methods. What are the best experimental methods for the
·fletermination of atomic weight ratios, and how shall the data be handled mathe-

matically? On each division of this question there is something to be said. The

existing methods, the methods which, are commonly employed, are somewhat

conventional in their character, and need exhaustive scrutiny. They are not

sufficiently varied in their details to eliminate all danger of constant or cumula-

tive errors, and new lines of attack, new points of view, ought to be considered

and developed.

At present, the data relative to atomic weights are treated like successive

links in a series of chains, each link to be considered separately ; while in reality

they form an interlacing network of interdependent quantities which should be

·/liscussed in some broadly general way.

myTo illustrate  meaning, let us consider a specific ratio,

                 CaF, : CaSO,,

-which has been repeatedly measured in order to determine the atomic weight of
>fluorine. In this case a series of measurements is made, involving of necessity

some error which may be great or small. From these data the atomic weight in

question is computed, with the assumption that the atomic weights of calcium
and sulphur are known. But these antecedent values are themselves in error by

small but unknown amounts, and these errors are superimposed upon the experi-

 mental error of the ratio itself, so that all tliree appear in the final result of the

calculation. The errors may be compensatory in part, or they may be cumula-
tive ; and which is the case we cannot certainly know. In a proper reduction

·of the data the ratio should contribute to our knowledge of all three of the atomic
weights represented, and its error should be distributed among them instead of
being piled, with others, upon one. That is, the ratio should not be discussed by
 itself, but should be combined with other ratios in such a manner that several
 related atomic weights might be determined simultaneously. This, I believe, will
 be the method of the future ; and ultimately all trustworthy evidence, concerning
 all atomic weights, will be put into one set of normal equations with simultaneous
 solution for all. First, the experimental errors will be made as small as possible

 after that they will be so uniformly distributed as to become inappreciable. For
 this procedure the mathematical method is well known, but the existiu"' data
 are too incomplete for its present application. The final reductions will not be
 possible for many years to come. Work, comparable with that of Stas and
 Morley, needs to be done for all the chemical elements, and done with a broad
 purpose in view ; after that the mathematician can contribute his share to the

 solution of the general problem.

      It is greatly to be hoped that at some future time some of the great labora-

 tories may undertake systematic work of the kind I have indicated. The

 fundamental constants of chemistry are surely of equal importance with the value
 of the ohm, the form of the earth, or the solar parallax ; and institutions like the

 Reichsanstalt in Berlin, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at
 Paris, or the Davy-Faraday laboratory of the Royal Institution, might well con-

 tribute to their determination. In this direction an international committee
 -conld exert an influence far beyond that of any individual, or even of any one
 society, but the problems at issue must first be clearly understood and formulated.

 To clear the ground, to arouse interest, and to stimulate systematic research, are

 important functions of the proposed body.

70G REPORT-- 1899.

            Atomic Weights. By Professor W. A. Tilden, F.Ii.S.

     The question of atomic weights has two aspects, the theoretical and the prac-
tical, tor the purposes of theory we require to know the relative values of the
atomic weights of all the elements with the utmost possible accuracy, with the
object chiefly of explaining observed relations and discovering new ones. The true
significance of the periodic scheme of arrangement will never be discovered till the
atomic weights of a much larger number of elements are known more correctly than

at present. And the employment of numbers which only roughly approximate to

the true values for the atomic weights has led in the past to a large amount of
speculation and discussion, of which nearly the whole is fruitless, because of
necessity successive hypotheses have had to be put aside as knowledge of the sub-
ject has advanced, and numbers less inaccurate have been gradually substituted.
This is true not only of such crude hypotheses as that of Prout, but of ideas pro-
posed in more recent times concerning the relations of the several series in
Mendeleefs table.

      Other questions have arisen, such as the possibility of the variation of the
atomic weights within certain limits, but they only serve to illustrate the extreme
 difficulty of the subject in its present position ; for while the facts are about

equally well known to all chemists who have studied it, they have led some Xo
consider variation possible, while others upon the same evidence are convinced

that it is impossible. Unfortunately the settlement of such questions is still far

oft", for the complete series of determinations of all the elements made with a
degree of accuracy comparable with that which has made the work of Stas
famous is not to be expected in the present generation.

      Another subject which has been reopened by the action of the distinguished
Committee of the German Chemical Society relates to the unit to be adopted.
The practice which has prevailed universally since the time of Berzelius, that is^
for nearly three-quarters of a century, of expressing the atomic weights in terms

of hydrojjen (H = 1) is now abandoned by the Committee in favour of the new
scale, in which oxygen is the standard and = 16. The considerations which
have influenced the several members of the Committee are chiefly three, namely,

Hfirst, the uncertainty still supposed to attach to the ratio : O, though this i,^

now as accurately known as it is likely to be ; secondly, the fact that the atomic
weights of many elements may be deduced directly from the composition of their

compounds with oxygen, but less frequently from compounds with hydrogen
thirdly and chiefly, because the oxygen scale brings many atomic weights ver_v
near to whole numbers. It is evident that this consideration is one which con-
cerns alike the analyst, the student, and the investigator in every analytical
operation, and in all circumstances which do not involve the discussion of the

Hnumerical interrelations of the atomic weights. For that purpose the = 1 scale

will always be preferable, until an element is discovered having a smaller atomic
weight than hydrogen, and of that there is at present no indication so far as
terrestrial chemistry is concerned.

     On the whole the proposal of the German Chemical Society is probably the
best solution of the difficulty. The scale in which = 16, however, implies the
value l-Ol, approximately, for hydrogen ; and though it is true that for common

analytical use the neglect to recognise this value will not lead to very serious con-
sequences, it must be remembered that an appreciable error will be involved in
expressing the composition of compounds which are comparatively rich in hydro-
gen, such as the chief hydrocarbons and their derivatives. For C^Hj^, for
example, the percentage of hydrogen is 16'66 or 1680, according to the value
assigned to the atomic weight of hydrogen.

    But supposing the O = 16 scale to be generally adopted, it is still highly

desirable that there should be an understanding among the several Chemical
Societies, and if possible among the members of these societies, as to the numbers
to be chosen for ordinary use. Are we to use 27"1 for Al, 137*4 for Ba, 208'5 for
Bi, 79-96 for Br, 35-45 for CI, 52-1 for Or, 126-85 for I, 206-9 forPb, 24-36 forMg,
200-3 for Hg, 14-04 for N, 194-8 for Pt, 39-15 for K, 23-05 for Na, 32-06 for S &c.,

instead of the nearest whole numbers as has been customary in all these cases, with
one exception, namely, chlorine ? The temptation will be great, especially when

we become aware that in the majority of cases the error introduced will be less
than the ordinary experimental error. The example of platinum at once presents

itself, without concerning ourselves about the special value for this element used

by the potash makers for reasons of their own. But comparing the result of
employing the old rounded-off numbers with that of using the more exact values
calculated on the = 16 scale, it is interesting to see how little is the effect on the
percentage composition of potassium platino-chloride deduced from the formula.

variously stated to last from five to twenty years, and this inquiry was undertalven
-with a view to advising as to the best means of cultivating the land, and also
to determine the amount of salt deposited, the time required for its removal by
drainage, and its chemical and physical effects upon the soil constituents, a
knowledge of which must be of value in the event of future inundations.

    By analysis made after the water had run off, but before an appreciable quan-
tity of rain had fallen, the soil was found to contain 02 per cent of salt, or about

twenty times the normal quantity. This was insufRcient to produce plasmolysis
of the root-hairs, and it therefore was not directly injurious to growing crops. Nor
was the condition of the soil then impaired ; indeed, the addition of salt to soil
tends at first to granulate the clay and render it more workable. The immediate
injury appeared to be chiefly due to the entire destruction of earth-worms. In the
following season (1898) very few crops were worth harvesting.

     The soils were re-examined this spring (1899). It was found that nine-tenths
of the salt had been washed down by rain and removed by drainage, and that
young worms had again made their appearance. The condition of the soil was,
however, very unsatisfactory, and while on some farms there was promise of fair
crops, on others the crops had failed. AVhen shaken with water the soil is no

longer quickly deposited, but remains partially suspended for several weeks,

evidence that the clay has become gelatinous. This is also shown by the higher
percentage of water of hydration in the air-dried clay from the flooded soil. The
retentivity of the soil for water had not become greatly altered, but percolation of
water through the flooded soil was just half as rapid as through the unflooded.

     These effects appear to be due to the chemical action of the chlorides of the
sea-water upon the double silicates of the soil. Analysis of the soil shows that
the percentage of lime, magnesia, potash, and soda had been reduced very mate-
rially, and this points to the decomposition of the double silicates, the silicate of
alumina being left behind in a gelatinous condition.

     It is obvious that for the amelioration of the soil attention must be directed to
rendering the soil more workable and open, and thus counteracting the effect of
the gelatinous clay. Ploughing in green crops or the straw of cereal crops and
long manure, and, above all, thorough fallowing, have already proved to be useful.
Also, the soil having become impoverished by the action of the salt, dressings of

lime and potash manures may be required, lime being especially valuable because
of its known effect in granulating clay.

  5. The Influence of Solvents upon the Optical Activity of Organic Com-

                      pounds. By William Jackson Pope.

     The author traces the variations in the specific rotation of an optically active

substance dissolved in various solvents to the degree of association of the active

compound ; it is shown that the specific rotation of Igevotetrahydroquinaldine, a

highly associated substance, varies from [aji, = -- 46° to -- 118° in different solvents
owing to the varying degree to which the association factor is changed. On the

other hand, a substance like Icevopinene, which is practically nonassociated in the
pure state, alters its specific rotation ^ery slightly when dissolved in different

solvents.

     Since the specific rotation is so largely dependent upon the association factor,
a method can be devised for determining whether a particular optically active
substance forms a liquid racemic compound with its optical antipodes. Thus pure

laevotetrahydroquinaldine has the specific rotation [a]^ = -- 58'12°, and when

dissolved in externally compensated tetrahydroquinaldine as solvent its specific

rotation becomes [aju = --6802° ; this practical identity between the two specific

rotations indicates that externally compensated tetrahydroquinaldine is merely a
mixture of the two antipodes, each of which retains in the mixture the association
factor which it possesses in the pure liquid state. Externally compensated tetra-
hydroquinaldine is, therefore, not a racemic compound.

  6. A Method /or Resolving Racemic Oximes into their Optically Active
                   Comjwnents. By William Jackson Pope.

     The author gLves a method for resolving very feebly basic racemic substances,
such as oximes, into their optically active components. The method consists in
forming salts of the feeble base with dextrocamphorsulphonic acid and separating
the salt of the dextro-base from that of the laevo-base by fractional crystallisa-
tion. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the method, racemic camphoroxime
was resolved into its active components by fractional crystallisation with the
equivalent quantity of camphorsulphonic acid ; dextrocamphoroxime dextrocamphor-
sulphonate, G.oH.yNOH, CjoHj^OSOgll, H,,0, separates first from the acetone or
ethereal solution, and when treated with dilute ammonia yields pure dextro-
camphoroxime. The more soluble loevocamphoroxime dextrocamphorsulphonate,
C](,H,gNOII, Cjf^HjjOSOgll, HjO, remains in the mother liquids, and after
appropriate purification yields Itevocamphoroxime when treated with ammonia.

  1. Phenomena connected with the Drying of Colloids, Mineral and

Organic. By J. H. Gladstone, F.R.S., and Walter Hibbert.

  --The object of this paper was to draw attention to some peculiarities observed

in the drying of colloids namely, the hydrates of tin, titanium, silica, iron, and

alumina, together with gelatine, gum, and albumen.

The mineral colloids when dried from solution approximate very closely to

definite hydrates. Through the shrinking caused by the evaporation of the water

they crack into non-crystalline blocks, which exhibit a variety of plienomena,

such as serrated edges, fringes, contour lines, and internal fissures of a crescent or

spiral form.

When the soft material gives oflf water the surface becomes hard, though the

Whenwater still continues to find its way through.                                                                         the dried surface is tough, as

in the case of gelatine, no internal structure is revealed, but where it is hard and

brittle, as iu the case of titanic hydrate, crescent-shaped cavities and contour lines
make their appearance round the region of final attachment.

In the case of the tin hydrate, where the crust is sufficiently strong to resist

distortion, cavities make their appearance, generally in the form of regular spirals,
often consisting of many convolutions. These spirals, with modifications, are also
shown in titanium hydrate, iron oxide, and albumen

     Of the above-mentioned elements, tin, titanium, silicon, and carbon are
members of Mendel^eflF's fourth group, while iron and alumina form sesquioxides.
While there is a close analogy among these organic and mineral colloids, there are

modifications which must be ascribed to the chemical nature of the particular

hydrate.

   2. The Influence of Acids and of some Salts on the Saccharification of

                Starch by Malt- Diastase. By Dr. A. Fernbach.

     In a series of papers on ' Invertase,' published in 1889 in the ' Annales de
ITnstitut Pasteur,' I proved that the slightest variations of acidity or alkalinity
have a very great influence on the action of the enzyme. Its action is greatly
favoured by the presence of free acid, and for each acid as well as for each sample
of invertase there is a definite quantity of acid which appears most favourable to
the action.

     It was natural to apply these observations to diastatic action, as it has been
                           --

710 REPORT-- 1899.

maintained by diflerent authors that acids favour the saccharification of starch by

diastase.

    My experiments have led me to a different conclusion. The slightest trace of

ffce acid distinctly retards the action of diastase on gelatinised as well as on soluble
.starch; this applies to all acids. The action is, however, apparent only if both the
starch employed and the solution of diastase are absolutely free from salts on which

the added acid may act.
     If the solution contains such salts, among which the most important are

secondary phosphates, which are distinctly unfavourable to diastatic action, the
addition of acid is favourable as long as there is no excess over the quantity neces-
sary to transform these salts into primary phosphates. In that case the acidity of
the liquid increases by addition of acid, but there is no free acid present as long as
1 be whole of the secondary salt is not decomposed. The unfavourable action of
acid appears as soon as the quantity added is greater than that required for this

decomposition.

   A distinction must therefore be made between acidity and free acid, as is

[iroved by the influence of primary phosphates or diastatic action, which salts,
although having an acid reaction, are distinctly favourable. This influence of
phosphates seems to be specific for salts of this kind.

    The same influence of phosphates may be noticed with enzymes other than
diastase, and I am at present engaged in investigating this subject farther in con-

junction with L. Hubert.

3. Note on the Combined Action of Diastase and Yeast on Starch-granules.

                      By G. Harris Morris, Ph.D., F.I.C.

    It has long been known that when yeast is allowed to act on a solution of

atarch-transformation products in the presence of active diastase, the quantity of

matter fermented is far in excess of that which can be fermented by the yeast
alone ; and, furthermore, that when active diastase and yeast are allowed to con-
jointly act on the so-called stable dextrin, which, under ordinary conditions, is
neither degradable by diastase nor fermentable by yeast, it is entirely fermented.
The action is apparently analogous to that of symbiosis, only, in place of two living

organisms being concerned, we have a conjunction of an unorganised enzyme,

diastase, and the yeast organism.

     Some experiments I was led to make a few years ago showed that a similar
action takes place when ungelatinised intact starch granules are submitted to the
joint action of diastase and yeast. The experiments were made with barley

starch, and were briefly as follows :

   A quantity of the dry starch was shaken continuously with a mixture of cold-

water malt extract and water for seventy-two hours.

   A similar mixture was made with the addition of a small quantity of yeast,

and allowed to stand side by side with the above for the same length of time.
     7\.n examination of the two then showed that in the first experiment 22'2 per

cent, of the starch had gone into solution, whilst in the second 51'8 per cent, had
disappeared. In the former the starch had been converted into maltose, and was
found in the solution ; in the latter, the maltose first formed had been to a very
large extent fermented, and existed as alcohol.

    It appeared possible that the increased action, when yeast was present, was due

-- --tf) the removal of the soluble product maltose from the field of action, thus

allowing the diastase to exert a greater activity. In order to determine this,
another experiment was made, and two bottles, one containing a mixture of starch,
malt extract, and water, the other a mixture of starch, malt extract, and solution
of starch transformation-products, were shaken side by side for the same length of
time. In each case the amount of starch dissolved was practically identical, thus
showing that the soluble products had no retarding action on the diastatic action.
Another experiment in which the product of the action of the diastase was

--removed by dialysis, instead of by fermentation, gave a similar result the sum of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  711

1 bo matter wliicli diffused, and tliat remaining in the dialyser was the same as that
in the mixture where no dialysis was possible.

     Other experiments showed that no increased diastatic action took place in the
presence of yeast, if the fermentative power of the latter was checked by chloro-
form, neither was any increase of action observed when the malt extract was
Jormented and the yeast removed before the starch-granules were added. It
appears, therefore, that it is necessary to have both the diastase and the yeast

present together in a condition capable of exercising their respective functions, in

order to obtain the increased action.

     Precipitated diastase acts in the same way as cold-water malt extract.
     The combined action of diastase and yeast on starch-granules differs from that

<if the two ou the so-called stable dextrin, since it only takes place on those
starches which are attacked in the imgelatinised form by diastase, such as barley
or malt starch. The granules of potato starch are not acted on by diastase, even

in the presence of yeast.

4. The Action of Acids on Starch. By G. Harris Morris, Fh.D., F.I.C.

     Some months ago, H. Johnson ' published a paper in which he maintains that
when starch is hydrolysed by acids only dextrose and dextrin are produced, and

that under no conditions is maltose formed in the reaction. lie also adopts the
view that glucoamylins are formed in the reaction ; these substances he regards
as molecular aggregates of dextrose and dextrin, similar to amyloins or malto-
dexti'ins, but containing the dextrose in place of the maltose group.

     This view of the acid hydrolysis of starch is opposed to that previously held hy
the majority of observers, and is completely at variance with the results obtained
by Eolfe and Defren, and the author's.

     Johnson states that the properties of the substances intermediate between starch

and dextrose can be expressed in terms of dextrin and dextrose, and that when
this is done the specific rotatory power calculated for such a mixture agrees with

the observed angle for the conversion. He supports this view by giving results

obtained with acid starch conversions and with fractions of such conversions ob-
tained by precipitation with alcohol.

     Johnson also states that the action of diastase on the products of the acid
hydrolysis of starch is very slight, thus further proving the different nature of the
products intermediate between dextrin and dextrose from those of conversions with

diastase.

   AThe author's experience is, however, directly opposed to that of Johnson.

large number of acid starch conversions, analysed and calculated in the manner
described by the latter, gave differences between the observed and calculated specihc
rotatory powers corresponding to the presence of from 5 to 45 per cent, of maltose.
The e.x^amination of alcoholic fractions gave similar results, and from the fractions,
the analysis of which indicated the presence of considerable percentages of maltose,
crystals of undoubted maltosazone were obtained.

     The results of the action of malt extract were also entirely different from those
obtained by Johnson, the fall in angle on degradation amounting on an average
to more than 20° [a]i>.

     The author's results were obtained from conversions made with different
starches and acids, and under varying conditions of temperature and jiressure, and
in nearly all cases the analytical data, when calculated in the manner indicated
above, showed a difference of angles, indicating the presence of maltose.

     Several of Ilolfe and Defren's results were also calculated in the manner adopted
by Johnson, and it was found that they fully confirmed those of the author.

     The author also criticised the law regarding the products of acid hydrolysis of
starch at which Rolfe and Defren had arrived, and he considered that owing to
the method of calculation accepted, further investigation was required before it

could be employed.

712 REPORT-- 1899.

    From the experience of the author, he is of opinion that the relative amountg

of dextrin, dextrose, and maltose present in any given acid conversion of starch
depend on the conditions under which the conversion is made, as regards strength
of acid, temperature, and pressure, and that it is not possible to predict the relative
proportions of the three carbohydrates from the specific rotatory povcer as is stated'
by Eolfe and Defren.

5. The Action of Hydrogen Peroxide on Carholujdrales in the Presence

           0/ Ferrous Salts. By R. S. Morrell and J. M. Crofts.

    At the Bristol meeting of the British Association we communicated the results

of the oxidation of glucose and levulose by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of
ferrous sulphate. The glucose and levulose were oxidised to the same osone, which

was identified by the formation of phenyl glucosazone at the ordinary temperature..

During the past year we have oxidised in the same way arabinose and galactose.'

The former sugar yields arabinosone, but galactose has, as yet, furnished no definite

rssults.

   We now wish to state some of the results obtained from the oxidation of the

glucosone produced when levulose is treated with hydrogen peroxide. The method,

adopted is to oxidise the glucosone by bromine-water after having first removed as
Wemuch of the unattaclied levulose as possible by fermentation.
                                                                 obtained the

calcium salt of a dibasic acid, which is very soluble in water, reduces Fehling's

solution easily, and the analyses point to the calcium salt of a dibasic acid of

formula C,;HgOg. The free acid we have not as yet obtained crystalline. Levulose,

by the action of oxidising agents, gives acids containing less than six carbon atoms,,

but from our results it would seem that the glucosone can be oxidised without

destruction of the six-carbon chain.

   We have ako tried the action of bromine on a solution of glucosone obtained

from glucose, after having removed as much of the unaltered glucose as possible,

--by fermentation with yeast. Unfortunately we have been unable to obtain a

pure calcium salt the analyses indicating the presence of some calcium gluconate.
    Besides the oxidation of the glucosone by bromine-water, we have oxidised

some of the saccharoses by hydrogen peroxide, namely cane sugar, lactose, and
maltose. In the case of cane sugar, the product is merely glucosone, and the yield

--of osazone is about 30 per cent, of the weight of cane sugar taken two atoms of

oxygen being used in the oxidation. This yield is nearly that obtained when»
glucose and levulose alone are oxidised. Lactose and maltose both yielded

substances which react with phenyl hydrazine acetate in the cold ; the yield of

osazone, however, was small, and the substance sometimes oily.

6. Influence of Substitution on Specific Rotation in the Bornylaiyiine Series^

                           By M. O. FORSTER, Ph.D., D.Sc.

     On replacing an atom of hydrogen belonging to a group attached to asymmetric
carbon in an optically active substance, the numerical value of the rotatory power

undergoes a change. Hitherto the hydroxylic and carboxylic groups have received
most attention, but these radicles contain only one hydrogen atom, and the author
has therefore studied the eflfect produced on the specific rotation of bornylamine-
by replacing the hydrogen atoms of the amino-group. The following observations
have been made :

     1. The specific rotation of bornylamine is largely increased by replacement oC
a single hydrogen atom in the amino-group by an alkyl radicle, but the increase
diminishes in ascending the series of monalkyl bases, of which methylbornylamine
has the greatest specific rotatory power.

     2. The specific rotation of bornylamine is only slightly increased on replacing-

toth hydrogren atoms in the amino-group by the same radicle. The specific rota-
tions of the condensation products of bornylamine with aromatic aldehydes, however,
do not exhibit marked approximation to that of the original base, althoiigh the
compounds in question are represented by the typical formula, C,olI,/N : X.

     3. The specilic rotatory power of paranitrohenzylbornylamine approximates
more closely to that of benV.ylbornylamine than does that of the ortho-derivative
Similarly, the specitic rotations of paranitro- and parahydroxybenzylidenebornyl-

amines are less divergent from that of benzylidenebornylamiue than the correspond-

ing ortho-compounds.
     4. Bornylamine and its alkyl derivatives, although strongly dextrorotatory,

give rise to benzoyl derivatives which are strongly Iffivorotatory.
     5. The ethyl group increases the dextrorotation of the base in alcohol by 29':i^,

whilst the formyl radicle, although of equal mass, converts it into a Iffivorotation

of 42-1°.

    6. When an alkyl group replaces a hydrogen atom of the ammonium radicle in

the series of alkylbornylammonium iodides, the specific rotatory power of bornyl-
amine hydriodide, instead of undergoing increase in the positive direction, becomes

reduced to feeble Isevorotation.

   A convenient method of preparing methylbornylamine, which may perhaps find

application in other groups of primary amines, consists in heating benzylidene-
bornylamine with methylic iodide, and hydrolysing the resulting methiodide, which
is resolved into benzaldehyde and methylbornylamine hydriodide. The remainintr

derivatives employed in this investigation were prepared by known methods.

                                                            By M. O. FoRSTER, Fh.D., D.Sc.

With the object of preparing brominated derivatives of camphoroxime the author

has studied the behaviour of this substance towards alkaline hypobromite.

The compound, C,f,H,j,NOoBr, is obtained by the action of a concentrated

ice-cold solution of potassium hypobromite on camphoroxime, dissolved, and in part

suspended, in aqueous potash ; it crystallises from alcohol in snow-white fern-like-

aggregates, and melts at 220° to a colourless liquid which immediately decomposes.

It is volatile in steam, and sublimes at the temperature of the water-bath, the

vapour having an intensely irritating odour; benzene, ether, and petroleum dis-

solve it with great readiness. The substance is optically active, and gives Lieber-

mann's reaction for nitroso-derivatives; reduction with zinc dust and acetic acid-

regenerates camphoroxime.

The compound, C,fjII,.,NOBr, produced when the foregoing substance is dis-

solved in concentrated sulphuric acid, crystallises from alcohol in lustrous

transparent prisms, and sublimes in minute needles at the temperature of the

water-bath                                              it shrinks and darkens at about  210°, becoming completely changed at

Treatment with hot concentrated hydrochloric acid converts it into the isomeride,

which separates from alcohol in large transparent six-sided crystals, and melts at

240°                       the  compound                does  not  give Liebermann's     reaction, but  yields  a  bensoyl'

The nitrile, CgHjj'CN, obtained when either of the compounds, CjoHj4NOBr,

is heated with an aqueous 20 per cent, solution of caustic soda, forms a limpid

fragrant oil, which boils at 198-199° under 760 mm. pressure ; it is feebly dextro-
rotatory, and a solution in chloroform instantly decolorises bromine. The amide,

CgH,3-C0NH.^, occurs as a by-product in the formation of the nitrile, and arises

from that substance under the influence of alcoholic potash ; it crystallises from
light petroleum in white highly lustrous needles, and melts at 90°. The acid,

CgHj^-COOH, prepared by heating the amide with concentrated hydrochloric acid,,

is volatile in steam, and readily sublimes in long lustrous needles, melting at 133°

but bromine is not decolorised by a solution of the acid in chloroform. Its
behaviour, therefore, resembles that of isolauronolic acid, C,,Hj^Oj, which melts at
135° ; * the amide of isolauronolic acid, however, is described by Blanc * as melting

at 129-130', and the nitrile boils at 205" under 760 mm.

continued.

                             By Colonel J. Waterhouse.

    Following on the lines of Moser's thermographic observations, it may be asserted

that pure silver is sensitive to light. If cut-out masks be laid upon the surface of
silver leaf or foil, or on a daguerreotype plate, and exposed to the sun's rays, a
visible image ultimately becomes apparent on the metallic surface. The effect,

however, may be got in a very much shorter space of time if the exposed metal be

subjected to mercury vapour or developed by immersion in an acid solution of a
ferrous salt mixed with nitrate of silver. Clear images, hardly as yet to be called

pictures, can thus be obtained of a permanent character, so that it may be possible

to work the daguerreotype process without iodising the plate. In fact all photo-
graphic phenomena, the invisible developable image, the visible image, reversal,
and the effect of pressure marks, can be illustrated on the plain silver surface
this, at least, is a new discovery. Copper also seems to be sensitive in the same
way, and doubtless other metals.

and that when the combination is heated until infusible the compound is repre-

sentable by Pt^Zng.

Deville and Debray, after treating the alloy of Pt and Zq with dilute sulphuric

acid, obtained a black powder containing 31 per cent, zinc and a little free

platinum.

     The method employed has been to submit a weighed amount of platinum to
the vapour of the volatile metal, maintaining the platinum or compound formed

all the time at a temperature above the boiling-point of the particular volatile

metal.

Two plans have been tried : one carrying the vapour with hydrogen ; another

a porcelain boat. Almost touching this was another boat containing the volatile

metal in very considerable excess. The region about the two boats was heated

very strongly in a powerful combustion furnace, and in the case where hydrogen

was used the current of gas passed over the zinc (or other metal) towards the

nearest the platinum so that the vapour could be drawn over the platinum.

In one e.Kperiment ·5832 of platinum absorbed ·QQ12 of cadmium.

     This alloy corresponds almost exactly to the formula PtCd,,. It is white and

crystalline and very brittle when heated to full redness in a vacuum tube. Scarcely
any cadmium sublimed from it. The loss in weight was inappreciable. Its relative-
weight was found to be 13-53 (at 15°), and the calculated weight for an alloy of

this composition is 13'59.

     In nitric acid some of the platinum is dissolved along with the cadmium.  The

--.same product was given by heating the metals together in a vacuum tube.
     Zinc in Hydrogen. The action was slower than with cadmium.

     In one experiment 45-57 per cent, zinc was taken up. PtZn., requires
40 per cent. Zn. On heating this 45'57 per cent, alloy for two hours in'a vacuum
tube some zinc distilled off, leaving a residue containing 44 per cent. Zn.

    It was now heated until the glass tube began to give way, the pump keeping
up a vacuum. The residue after about four hours contained 24-45 per cent. Zn.

This is nearly PtZn, which requires 25 per cent. Zn. It seemed hopeless to get
more zinc driven off in glass tubes.

     The alloy is crystalline and extremely brittle. It dissolves in acids pretty
much like the cadmium alloy.

    Heated side by side in the vacuum the alloy of PtZn seemed to be formed, but

--the process was very slow, the zinc vapour not travelling very far.
    Magnesium. This was the most difficult, as at the temperature employed the
magnesium vapour is almost entirely absorbed by the glass of the tube and by the

porcelain boat.

Some magnesium was distilled in vacuum. This was placed in a porcelain

boat lined with MgO. The platinum was placed as close as possible and the
Awhole heated until the magnesium was melted.
                                               gentle current of very dry

hydrogen was then kept up for some hours. An extremely friable crystalline alloy

was produced. From the amount absorbed it corresponds very nearly to the formula

PtMg.,.

  --Falladium. The experiments with this metal and cadmium and zinc have so

far failed to give any result, ^'ery little cadmium seems to be taken up by

palladium either when heated in vacuo or in a current of hydrogen. What little

is taken up distils away very easily. It is possible to keep a piece of palladium

foil for two hours in cadmium vapour without change. There is a little more

tendency for zinc to alloy, or be absorbed.

    Nickel behaves very like palladium in this respect. Some electro-deposited
nickel foil was heated for several hours in cadmium vapour without appreciable

change in weight.

These experiments are being repeated.

11. Action of Acetylic and Benzoylic Chlorides on dried Copper Sid^jkate,

    By Professor W. R. E. Hodgkinson and Captain Leahy, E.A.,

     Ordnance College, Woolwich.

     These experiments were undertaken to ascertain whether there would be any
ground for considering copper sulphate monohydrate as an acid body. The ratio
of magnesium dissolved to copper deposited from a solution of copper sulphate

(^Clowes) suggested such a nature.

    Pure copper sulphate in fine powder was dried for a week at 98° C. An

analj'sis showed that it contained exactly 1 molecule water.
     Weighed quantities of this salt were submitted to the action of acetylic

chloride, firstly by dissolving the chloride in metaxylene, and agitating this with
716 REPORT-- 1899.

the fine powder of the copper salt and heating up to about 100° C. As this method
was found to produce acet-metaxylene, it was abandoned.

     Weighed quantities of the salt were then exposed in shallow platinum trays to
the vapour of the chloride. After trying several temperatures with varying
results it was found that an evident definite reaction took place when the vapour
of the chloride was simply carried over the copper salt by a stream of well-dried
CO., at the temperature 12°-16° C. Under these cii'ciunstances the copper sulphate
changed colour from almost white to deep chocolate brown, and hydrogen chloride
was evolved . Analyses indicate this product to be a copper sulphate mono-acetate.

     On heating the tube containing the tray with salt to about 110° C. the com-
pound evidently decomposed. It became quite white, acetic anhydride was given
off, and the residue in the tray was pure CuSO^.

     There was distinct evidence that at about 60°-70° C. an intermediate com-
pound was formed from the action of the excess of chloride on the acetate first
formed. This appeared to be a compound of the anhydride with the CuSO.,.
Scarcely a trace of chlorine was retained by the copper salt.

     Benzoyllc chloride appeared to behave in a perfectly similar manner. The

figures obtained are not very close to theory, but scarcely leave any doubt about
the composition of the products and the analogy with the acetylic compound.

     In one experiment the copper salt absorbed 20'16 per cent, of acetyl. If the

reaction proceeded according to CuSO.jH.O + CH.COCl = HCl + CuSO^CHgCOOH,

the gain in weight should be 23 72 per cent. In another experiment 48*28 per

cent, of acetic anhydride was contained. On the assumption that the reaction
CuSO.CHjCOOH + UH3COCI = HCl + CuSO.CHsCOOOC CH3 took place the gain
in weight should be 47'45 per cent. Some similar results were obtained with

benzoylic chloride.

     The experiments are being continued.

12. T]te Reaction hetwmn Potassium Cyanide and I : 3 Dinitro-henzene.

    By Professor AV. R. E. Hodgkixson ami Lieutenant W. H. VVebley-

     HoPE, R.A.

In the ' Berichte ' for 1884 is an abstract ^ of a communication by Lobry de

Bruyn on the action of alkaline cyanide on 1 : 3-dinitro-benzene. The result of

this action is stated to be an oxyethyl-nitro-benzonitrile, 1:2:6. Beilstein refers

to this abstract in the ' Ilandbuch.'

The reaction has been tried with a slight modification. In the abstract above

cited an alcoholic solution of the dinitro-benzene was treated with the potassium

Wecyanide dissolved in some water.             have employed the purest potassium

cyanide obtainable, and as nearly absolute alcohol as ordinarily possible.

On digesting for a little time (forty to sixty minutes) on a water-bath the

purple-red coloration {loc. cit.) was observed, and the final change to a dirty

brown. On cooling a considerable crystallisation took place. The solid was sepa-

rated from the excess of alcohol, and was found to dissolve for the most part in

Ahot water.  small amount of black amorphous substance remained insoluble.

On acidifying the solution a brown substance precipitated. It was washed with

very dilute acid (H^SOj) and then dissolved in hot alcohol, from which crystals

deposited on cooling and also on evaporation.

    On analysis (nitrogen) figures have been obtained, pointing distinctly to a
compound CgH^NOjCN. Considerably more than 80 per cent, of the dinitro-

benzene employed seems to have been thus converted.

The same body has been obtained with dry methylic alcohol and also with

normal propylic alcohol as solvents for the dinitro-benzene.

With acetone and paraldehyde as solvents, beyond the formation of a small

amount of very intense colouring matter, very little action seems to have taken

place, for over 90 per cent, of the dinitro-benzene was recovered, and very little
cyanide was acted upon.

     With an appreciable amount of water present, and ordinary very alkaline

cyanide, the reaction probably runs quite difiFerently.

     Under our conditions of working we have failed to obtaia any sign of an

oxyethyl or oxymethyl derivative.
     The nitrocyanide or nitrile forms brown needle-shaped crystals from alcohol.

It decomposes at about 200°, feebly deflagrating.

     It does not seem to hydrolise when boiled with potassium hydrate, or with

strong hydrogen chloride.
     The work was commenced with a view of employing the oxyethyl-nitro-uitrile

as a starting point for another research. It now seems advisable to examine this

reaction under several conditions, such as the effect of water and free alkali in the

cyanide.

13. The Presence of Potassium Nitrite in Broion Powder Residue when

      the Powder is burnt in Air under Ordinary Pressure. By Mr. Setok,

      R.A., and Mr. Stevenson, B.A., Ordnance College, Woolwich.

    Ordinary black powders when burnt in air under ordinary pressure leave a
small quantity of residue in which carbonate, sulphate, and sulphide of potassium
predominate. Traces only of nitrate and nitrite and other compounds can usually

be found. When examined quantitatively, however, the three salts above men-

tioned together make up some 98 per cent, of the whole. Brown powders burn
much more slowly, and in consequence the residue is larger. It is generally white

or greyish-white, hygroscopic, and for the most part soluble in water.

     Some analyses were made of these brown-powder residues to determine the
relation of sulphate to carbonate ; no sulphide is, as a rule, present. It was first

noticed on acidifying that red fumes were produced. This of course indicated
presence of nitrites in more than mere traces.

     Several determinations of the amount of nitrite, by permanganate and by the
nitrometer, gave about 6 per cent, calculated as KNOo.

                   Section C-- GEOLOGY.
--President op the Sectiox. Sib Akchibald Geieie, D.C.L., D.Sc, F.R.S.

The President delivered the folio-wing Address on Saturday, September 16 :

Among the many questions of great theoretical importance which have engaged

the attention of geologists, none has in late years awakened more interest or

aroused livelier controversy than that which deals with Time as an element in

--geological history. The various schools which have successively arisen Cata-
--clysmal, Uniformitarian, and Evolutionist have had each its own views as to the

duration of their chronology, as well as to the operations of terrestrial energy.

But though holding different opinions, they did not make these differences matter

of special controversy among themselves. About thirty years ago, however, they
were startled by a bold irruption into their camp from the side of physics. They

were then called on to reform their ways, which were declared to be flatly opposed

to the teachings of natural philosophy. Since that period the discussion then

started regarding the age of the Earth and the value of geological time has con-

tinued with varying animation. Evidence of the most multifarious kind has been

brought forward, and arguments of widely different degrees of validity have been

pressed into service both by geologists and palaeontologists on one side, and by

physicists on the other. For the last year or two there has been a pause in

the controversy, though no general agreement has been arrived at in regard to the

matters in dispute. The present interval of comparative quietude seems favourable

for a dispassionate review of the debate. I propose, therefore, to take, as perhaps

a not inappropriate subject on which to address geologists upon a somewhat

international occasion like this present meeting of the British Association at Dover,

the question of Geological Time. In offering a brief history of the discussion, I

gladly avail myself of the opportunity of enforcing one of the lessons which the

discussion has impressed upon my own mind, and to point a moral which, as it seems

to me, we geologists may take home to ourselves from a consideration of the

whole question. There is, I think, a practical outcome which may be made to

issue from the controversy in a combination of sympathy and co-operation among
Ageologists all over the world.
                                 lasting service will be rendered to our science if

by well-concerted effort we can place geological dynamics and geological chrono-

logy on a broader and firmer basis of actual experiment and measurement than

has yet been laid.

    To understand aright the origin and progress of the dispute regarding the

value of time in geological speculation, we must take note of the attitude main-
tained towards this subject by some of the early fathers of the science. Among

these pioneers none has left his mark more deeply graven on the foundations of
                                             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                              719

modern geology than James Hutton. To him, more than to any other writer of

his day, do we owe the doctrine of the high antiquity of our globe. No one

before him had ever seen so clearly the abimdant and impressive proofs of this

remote antiquity recorded in the rocks of the earth's crust. In these rocks he

traced the operation of the same slow and quiet processes which he observed to
be at work at present in gradually transforming the face of the existing conti-

nents. When he stood face to face with the proofs of decay among the moun-

tains, there seems to have arisen uppermost in his mind the thought of the
immense succession of ages which these proofs revealed to him. His observant

eye enabled him to see ' the operations of the surface wasting the solid body of

the globe, and to read the unmeasurable course of time that must have flowed

during those amazing operations, which the vulgar do not see, and which the
learned seem to see without wonder.' * In contemplating the stupendous results

achieved by such apparently feeble forces, Hutton felt that one great objection he
had to contend with in the reception of his theory, even by the scientific men of

his day, lay in the inability or unwillingness of the human mind to admit such

large demands as he made on the past. ' What more can we require ? ' he asks

in summing up his conclusions ; and he answers the question in these memorable
                                 ' What more can we require ?
words                                                              Nothing but time.  It is not any part of
                              :

--the process that will be disputed ; but after allowing all the parts, the whole will
be denied and for what ?                          only because we are not disposed to allow that quan-
                                               ;

tity of time which the ablution of so much wasted mountain might require.' ^

Far as Hutton could follow the succession of events registered in the rocky

crust of the globe, he found himself balHed by the closing in around him of that
dark abysm of time into which neither eye nor imagination seemed able to pene-
trate. _He_well knew that, behind and beyond the ages recorded in the oldest of

the primitive rocks, there must have stretched a vast earlier time, of which no

record met his view. He did not attempt to speculate beyond the limits of his

evidence.                        'I  do not  pretend,'  he  said,  ' to describe the  beginning of   things                            I
                                                                                                                                    ;

take things such as I find them at present, and from these I reason with rega'i-d to

that which must have been.'* In vain could he look, even among the oldest

formations, for any sign of the infancy of the planet. He could only detect a

mrepeated series of similar revolutions, the oldest of which was assuredly not the

first the terrestrial history, and he concluded, as 'the result of this physical

inquiry, that we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end.' *

This conclusion from strictly geological evidence has been impugned from the

side of physics, and, as further developed by Playfair, has been declared to be

contradicted by the principles of natural philosophy. But if it be considered on

the basis of the evidence on which it was originally propounded, it was absolutely

true in Hutton's time and remains true to-day. That able reasoner never claimed

that the earth has existed from all eternity, or that it will go on existing for ever.

He admitted that it must have had a beginning, but he had been unable to find
any vestige of that beginning in the structure of the planet itself. And notwith-

standing all the multiplied researches of the century that has passed since the

immortal ' Theory of the Earth ' was published, no relic of the first condition of
Weour earth has been found.
                                                        have speculated much, indeed, on the subject, and

our friends the physicists have speculated still more. Some of the speculations do
not seem to me more philosophical than many of those of the older cosmogonists.
As far as reliable evidence can be drawn from the rocks of the globe itself, we do

not seem to be nearer the discovery of the beginning than Hutton was. The most

ancient rocks that can be reached are demonstrably not the first-formed of all.

They were preceded by others which we know must have existed, though no
vestige of them may remain.

    It may be further asserted that, while it was Hutton who first impressed on

modern geology the conviction that for the adequate comprehension of the past

720 REPORT-- 1899.

history of the earth vast periods of time must be admitted to have elapsed, our
<leht of obligation to him is increased by the genius with which he linked the

passage of these vast periods with the present economy of nature. He first

realised the influence of time as a factor in geological dynamics, and first taught the
efficacy of the quiet and unobtrusive forces of nature. His predecessors and con-
temporaries were never tired of invoking the more vigorous manifestations of
terrestrial energy. They saw in the composition of the land and in the structure

of mountains and valleys memorials of numberless convulsions and cataclysms.
In Hutton's philosophy, however, ' it is the little causes, long continued, which
vire considered as bringing about the greatest changes of the earth.'

    And yet, unlike many of those who derived their inspiration from his teaching,

but pushed his tenets to extremes which he doubtless never anticipated, he did not
look upon time as a kind of scientific fetich, the invocation of which would endow

with efficacy even the most trifling phenomena. As if he had foreseen the use
that might be made of his doctrine, he uttered this remarkable warning : ' With
regard to the effect of time, though the continuance of time may do much in those

operations which are extremely slow, where no change, to our observation, had

appeared to take place, yet, where it is not in the nature of things to produce the
change in question, the unlimited course of time would be no more effectual than

the moment by which we measure events in our observations.' -

    We thus see that in the philosophy of Hutton, out of which so much of

modern geology has been developed, the vastness of the antiquity of the globe was
<leduced from the structure of the terrestrial crust and the slow rate of action of
the forces by which the surface of the crust is observed to be modified. But no
attempt was" made by him to measure that antiquity by any of the chronological

standards of human contrivance. He was content to realise for himself and to

impress upon others that the history of the earth could not be understood, save by
the admission that it occupied prolonged though indeterminate ages in its accom-

plishment. And assuredly no part of his teaching has been more amply sustained

by the subsequent progress of research.
     Playfair, from whose admirable ' Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory ' most

geologists have derived all that they know directly of that theory, went a little
further than his friend and master in dealing with the age of the earth. Not
restricting himself, as Hutton did, to the testimony of the rocks, which showed

neither vestige of a beginning nor prospect of an end, he called in the evidence of
the cosmos outside the limits of our planet, and declared that in the firmament

also no mark could be discovered of the commencement or termination of the
present order, no symptom of infancy or old age, nor any sign by which the future

or past duration of the universe might be estimated.^ He thus advanced beyond

the strictly geological basis of reasoning, and committed himself to statements
which, like some made also by Hutton, seem to have been suggested by certain
deductions of the French mathematicians of his day regarding the stability of the
planetary motions. His statements have been disproved by modern physics ; dis-
tinct evidence, both from the earth and the cosmos, has been brought forward of

progress from a beginning which can be conceived, through successive stages to an
end which can be foreseen. But the disproof leaves Hutton's doctrine about the
vastness of geological time exactly where it was. Surely it was no abuse of
language to speak of periods as being vast, which can only be expressed in

millions of years.

     It is easy to understand how the Uniformitarian school, which sprang from the
teaching of Hutton and Playfair, came to believe that the whole of eternity was at

the disposal of geologists. In popular estimation, as the ancient science of astro-

nomy was that of infinite distance, so the modern study of geology wac the science
·of infinite time. It must be frankly conceded that geologists, believing themselves
imfettered by any limits to their chronology, made ample use of their imagined
liberty. Many of them, following the lead of Lyell, to whose writings in other

tespects modem geology owes so deep a debt of gratitude, became utterly reckless
in their demands for time, demands which even the requirements of their own

 science, if they had adequately realised tliem, did not warrant. The older geolo-
 gists had not attempted to express their vast periods in terms of years. The
 indefiniteness of their language fitly denoted the absence of any ascertainable

 limits to the successive ages with which they had to deal. And until some

 evidence should be discovered whereby these hmits might be fixed and measured
 by human standards, no reproach could justly be brought against the geological
 terminology. It was far more philosophical to be content, in the meanwhile, with

 indeterminate expressions, than from data of the weakest or most speculative kind
 to attempt to measure geological periods by a chronology of years or centuries.

     In the year 1862 a wholly new light was thrown ou the question of the age of
 our globe and the duration of geological time by the remarkable paper on the
 Secular Cooling of the Earth communicated by Lord Kelvin (then Sir AVilliam
Thomson) to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.' In this memoir he first developed
his now well-known argument from the observed rate of increase of temperature
downwards from the surface of the land. He astonished geologists by announcing
to them that some definite limits to the age of our planet might be ascertained,
 and by declaring his belief that this age must be more than 20 millions, but less

 than 400 millions of years.

     Nearly four years later he emphasised his dissent from what he considered to

be the current geological opinions of the day by repeating the same argument in a
move pointedly antagonistic form in a paper of only a few sentences, entitled
' The Doctrine of Uniformity in Geology briefly refuted.' -

     Again, after a further lapse of about two years, when, as President of the
Geological Society of Glasgow, it became his duty to give an address, he returned
to the same topic and arraigned more boldly and explicitly than ever the geology

of the time. He then declared that ' a great reform in geological speculation seems
now to have become necessary,' and he went so far as to afiirm that ' it is quite

--certain that a great mistake has been made that British popular geology at the

present time is in direct opposition to the principles of natural philosophy.'^ In
pressing once more the original argument derived from the downward increase of

terrestrial temperature, he now reinforced it by two further arguments, the one

based on the retardation of the earth's angular velocity by tidal friction, the other
on the limitation of the age of the sun.

     These three lines of attack remain still those along which the assault from
physics is delivered against the strongholds of geology. Lord Kelvin has repeatedly

returned to the charge since 18G8, his latest contribution to the controversy having
been pronounced two years ago.^ AVhile his physical arguments remain the same,
the limits of time which he deduces from them have been successively diminished.

The original maximum of 400 millions of years has now been restricted by him to
not much more than 20 millions, while Professor Tait grudgingly allows something

less than 10 millions.''

     Soon after the appearance of Lord Kelvin's indictment of modern geology in

1868, the defence of the science was taken up by Huxley, who happened at the
time to be President of the Geological Society of London. In his own inimitably

brilliant way, half seriously, half playfully, this doughty combatant, with evident
relish, tossed the physical arguments to and fro in the eyes of hLs geological

brethren, as a barrister may flourish his brief before a sympathetic jury. He was
willing to admit that ' the rapidity of rotation of the earth may be diminishing,
that the sun viai) be waxing dim, or that the earth itself may be cooling.' But he
went on to add his suspicion that ' most of us are Gallios, " who care for none of

difference to the earth, during the period of which a record is preserved in stratified

deposits.' 1

     For the indifference which their advocate thus professed on their behalf most
geologists believed that they had ample justification. The limits within which the
physicist would circumscribe the earth's history were so vague, yet so vast, that

whether the time allowed were 400 millions or 100 millions of years did not seem

to them greatly to matter. After all, it was not the time that chiefly interested
them, but the grand succession of events which the time had witnessed. That

succession had been established on observations so abundant and so precise that it

could withstand attack from any quarter, and it had taken as firm and lasting a
place among the solid achievements of science as could be claimed for any physical
speculations whatsoever. Whether the time required for the transaction of this

marvellous earth-history was some millions of years more or some millions of years

less did not seem to the geologists to be a question on which their science stood in

antagonism with the principles of natural philosophy, but one which the natural

philosophers might be left to settle at their own good pleasure.

For myself, I may be permitted here to say that I have never shared this feel-

ing of indifference and unconcern. As far back as the year 1868, only a month

after Lord Kelvin's first presentation of his threefold argument in favour of limit-

mying the age of the earth, I gave in  adhesion to the propriety of restricting the

geological demands for time. I then showed that even the phenomena of denuda-

tion, which, from the time of Hutton downwards, had been most constantly and

confidently appealed to in support of the inconceivably vast antiquity of our globe,

might be accounted for, at the present rate of action, within such a period as

100 millions of years." To my mind it has always seemed that whatever tends to

give more precision to the chronology of the geologist, and helps him to a clearer

conception of the antiquity with which he has to deal, ought to be welcomed by

him as a valuable assistance in his inquiries. And I feel sure that this view of
the matter has now become genei'al among those engaged in geological research.

Frank recognition is made of the influence which Lord Kelvin's persistent attacks

have had upon our science. Geologists have been led by his criticisms to revise
their chronology. They gratefully acknowledge that to him they owe the intro-

duction of important new lines of investigation, which link the solution of the
problems of geology with those of physics. They realise how much he has done

to dissipate the former vague conceptions as to the duration of geological history,

and even when they emphatically dissent from the greatly restricted bounds within
which he would now limit that history, and when they declare their inability to

perceive that any reform of their speculations in this subject is needful, or that

their science has placed herself in opposition to the principles of physics, they none

the less pay their sincere homage to one who has thrown over geology, as over so
many other departments of natural knowledge, the clear light of a penetrating and

original genius.

    When Lord Kelvin first developed his strictures on modem geology he expressed

his opposition in the most uncompromising language. In the short paper to which
reference has already been made he announced, without hesitation or palliation,
that he ' briefly refuted ' the doctrine of Uniformitarianism which had been espoused
and illustrated by Lyell and a long list of the ablest geologists of the day. The
severity of his judgment of British geology was not more marked than was his

unqualified reUance on his own methods and results. This confident assurance of

a distinguished physicist, together with a formidable array of mathematical

formulfe, produced its efi'ect on some geologists and palaeontologists who were not

Gallios. Thus, even after Huxley's brilliaiit defence, Darwin could not conceal
the deep impression which Lord Kelvin's arguments had made on his mind. In
one letter he wrote that the proposed limitation of geological time was one of his

* sorest troubles.' In another, be pronounced the pbysicist blinself to be ' an odiou3

spectre.'

     The same self-confidence of assertion on the part of some, at least, of the dispu-

tants on the physical side has continued all through the controrersy. Yet when we
examine the three great physical arguments in themselves, we find them to rest on

assumptions which, though certified as ' probable ' or ' very sure,' are nevertheless
admittedly assumptions. The conclusions to which these assumptions lead must

depend for their validity on the degree of approximation to the truth in the

premisses which are postulated.

    Now it is interesting to observe that neither the assumptions nor the conclusions

drawn from them have commanded universal assent even among physicists them-
selves. If they were as self-evident as they have been claimed to be, they should
at least receive the loyal support of all those whose function it is to pursue and

extend the applications of physics. It will be remembered, however, that thirteen

years ago Professor George Darwin, who has so often shown his inherited sympathy

in geological investigation, devoted his presidential address before the Mathe-

matical Section of this Association to a review of the three famous physical

arguments respecting the age of the earth. He summed up his judgment of them

in the following words : ' In considering these three arguments I have adduced
some reasons against the validity of the first [tidal friction] ; and have endeavoured
to show that there are elements of uncertainty surrounding the second [secular

cooling of the earth] ; nevertheless they undoubtedly constitute a contribution of

the first importance to physical geology. AVhilst, then, we may protest against
the precision with which Professor Tait seeks to deduce results from them, we are
fully justified in following Sir William Thomson, who says that "the existing

--state of things on the earth, life on the earth all geological history showing con-

tinuity of life, must be limited within some such period of past time as 100,000,000

years." ' -

     More recently Professor Perry has entered the lists, from the physical side, to

challenge the validity of the conclusions so confidently put forward in limitation

of the age of the earth. He has boldly impugned each of the three physical argu-

ments. That which is based on tidal retardation, following Mr. Maxwell Close
and Professor Darwin, he dismisses as fallacious. In regard to the argument from

the secular cooling of the earth, he contends that it is perfectly allowable to assume

a much higher conductivity for the interior of the globe, and that this assumption
would vastly increase our estimate of the age of the planet. As to the conclusions
drawn from the history of the sun, he maintams that, on the one hand, the sun
may have been repeatedly fed by iufalling meteorites, and that on the other the
earth, during former ages, may bave had its heat retained by a dense atmospheric
envelope. He thinks that ' almost anything is possible as to the present internal
state of the earth,' and he concludes in these words : ' To sum up, we can find no
published record of any lower maximum age of life on the earth, as calculated by
physicists, than 400 millions of years. From the three physical arguments. Lord
Kelvin's bigher limits are 1,000, 400, and 500 million years. I have shown that
we have reasons for believing that the age, from all these, may be very considerably
underestimated. It is to be observed that if we exclude everything but the argu-
ments from mere physics, the probable age of life on the earth is much less than
any of the above estimates ; but if the palseontologists have good reasons for
demanding much greater times, I see nothing from the physicist's point of view
which denies them four times the greatest of these estimates.' ^

      This remarkable admission from a recognised authority on the physical side
re-echoes and emphasises the warning pronounced by Professor Darwin in the
address already quoted : 'At present our knowledge of a definite limit to geolo-

gical time has so little precision that we should do wrong to summarily reject any

theories which appear to demand longer periods of time than those tvliicli ndW

appear allowahle: '

     This ' wrong,' which Professor Darwin so seriously deprecated, has been com-
mitted not once, but again and again, in the history of this discussion. Lord
Kelvin has never taken any notice of the stron<^ body of evidence adduced by
geologists and palasontologists in favour of a much longer antiquity than he is

now disposed to allow for the age of the earth. His own three physical arguments

have been successively re-stated, with such corrections and modifications as he has

found to be necessary, and no doubt further alterations are in store for them. He

has cut off slice after slice from the allovv^ance of time which at first he was pre-

pared to grant for the evolution of geological history, his latest pronouncement
being that ' it was more than twenty and less than forty million years, and

probably much nearer twenty than forty.' - But in none of his papers is there an

admission that geology and palajontology, though they have again and again raised
their voices in protest, have anything to say in the matter that is worthy of

consideration.

     It is difficult satisfactorily to carry on a discussion in which yr ur opponent

entirely ignores your arguments, while you have given the fullest attention to his.

In the present instance, geologists have most carefully listened to all that has been
brought forward from the physical side. Impressed by the force of the physical

reasoning, they no longer believe that they can make any demands they may please

on past time. They have been willing to accept Lord Kelvin's original estimate
of 100 millions of years as the period within which the history of life upon the
planet must be comprised ; while some of them have even sought in various ways
to reduce that sum nearer to his lower limit. Yet there is undoubtedly a preva-
lent misgiving, whether in thus seeking to reconcile their requirements with the
demands of the physicist they are not tjing themselves down within limits of

time which on any theory of evolution would have been insufficient for the

development of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.

      It is unnecessary to recapitulate before this Section of the British Association,
even in briefest outline, the reasoning of geologists and palaeontologists which

leads them to conclude that the history recorded in the crust of the earth must
have required for its transaction a much vaster period of time than that to which

the physicists would now restrict it.^ Let me merely remark that the reasoning

is essentially based on observations of the present rate of geological and biological

changes upon the earth's surface. It is not, of course, maintained that this rate
has never varied in the past. But it is the only rate with which we are familiar,

which we can watch and in some degree measure, and which, therefore, we can

take as a guide towards the comprehension and interpretation of the past history

of our planet.

    It may be, and has often been, said that the present scale of geological and

biological processes cannot be accepted as a reliable measure for the past. Start-

ing from the postulate, which no one will dispute, that the total sum of terrestrial
energy was once greater than it is now and has been steadily declining, the
physicists have boldly asserted that all kinds of geological action must have been

more vigorous and rapid during bygone  ages than  they  are to-day                                           that volcanoes

were more gigantic, earthquakes more frequent and destructive, mountain-upthrows

more stupendous, tides and waves more powerful, and commotions of the atmo-

sphere more violent, with more ruinous tempests and heavier rainfall. Assertions
of this kind are temptingly plausible and are easily made. But it is not enough
that they should be made ; they ought to be supported by some kind of evidence

    ^ The geological arguments are briefly given in my Presidential Address to the

British Association at the Edinburgh Meeting of 1892. The biological arguments
were well stated, and in some detail, by Professor Poulton in his Address to the

Zoological Section of the Association at the Liverpool Meeting of 1896.

to show that they are founded on actual fact and not on mere theoretical possibilitv.
Such evidence, if it existed, could surely be produced. The chronicle of the earth's
history, from a very early period down to the present time, has been legibly

written within the sedimentary formations of the terrestrial crust. Let tlie appoal

be made to tbat register. Does it lend any support to the .affirmation that the
geological processes are now feebler and slower than the}' used to be ? If it does,
the physicists, we might, suppose, would gladly bring forward its evidence as irre-

fragable confirmation of the soundness of their contention. But the geologists

have found no such confirmation. On the contrary, they have been unable to dis-

cover any indication that the rate of geological causation has ever, on the whole,

greatly varied during the time which has elapsed since the deposition of the oldest
stratified rocks. They do not assert that there has been no variation, that there
have been no periods of greater activity, both hypogene and epigene. But they

maintain that the demonstration of the existence of such periods has yet to be

made. They most confidently affirm that whatever may have happened in the

earliest ages, in the whole vast succession of sedimentary strata nothing has yet
been detected which necessarily demands that more violent and rapid action which

the physicists suppose to have been the order of nature during the past.

So far as the potent effects of prolonged denudation permit us to judge, the

latest mountain-upheavals were at least as stupendous as any of older date whereof

the basal relics can yet be detected. They seem, indeed, to have been still more
gigantic than those It may be doubted, for example, whether among the vestiges

that remain of Mesozoic or Palffiozoic mountain-chains any instance can be found

so colossal as those of Tertiary times, such as the Alps. No volcanic eruptions of

the older geological periods cau compare in extent or volume with those of Tertiary
and recent date. The plication and dislocation of the terrestrial crust are propor-
tionately as conspicuously displayed among tlie younger as among the older forma-

tions, though the latter, from their greater antiquity, have suffered during a longer
time from the renewed disturbances of successive periods.

    As regards evidence of greater violence in the surrounding envelopes of atmo-
sphere and ocean, we seek for it in vain among the stratified rocks. Among the
very oldest formations of these islands, the Torridon sandstone of North-West

Scotland presents us with a picture of long- continued sedimentation, such as may
be seen in progress now round the shores of many a mountain-girdled lake. In

that venerable deposit, the enclosed pebbles are not mere angular blocks and chips,
swept by a sudden flood or destructive tide from off" the surface of the land, and
huddled together in confused heaps over the floor of the sea. They have been
rounded and polished by the quiet operation of running water, as stones are

rounded and polished now in the channels of brooks or on the shores of lake and
eea. They have been laid gently down above each other, layer over layer, with fine

sand sifted in between them, and this deposition has taken place along shores which,
though the waters that washed them have long since disappeared, can still be followed

for mile after mile across the mountains and glens of the North-West Highlands.

So tranquil were these waters that their gentle currents and oscillations sufficed to

ripple the sandy floor, to arrange the sediment in laminte of current-bedding, and to

Weseparate the grains of sand according to their relative densities.  may even now

trace the results of these operations in thin darker layers and streaks of magnetic

iron, zircon, and other heavy minerals, which have been sorted out from the lighter

quartz-grains, as layers of iron-sand maybe seen sifted together by the tide along
the upper margins of many of our sandy beaches at the present day.

     In the same ancient formation there occur also various intercalations of fine

muddy sediment, so regular in their thin alternations, and so like those of younger
formations, that we cannot but hope and expect that they may eventually yield

remains of organisms which, if found, would be the earliest traces of life in

Europe.

It is thus abundantly manifest that even in the most ancient of the sedimentary

registers of the earth's history, not only is there no evidence of colossal floods, tides
and denudation, but there is incontrovertible proof of continuous orderly deposi-

tion, such as may be witnessed to-day in any quarter of the globe. The same tale,
72G REPORT--1899.

with endless additional details, is told all tlirougli the stratified formations down

to those which ave iu the course of accumulation at the present day.

Not less important than the stratigraphical is the palseontological evidence in

favour of the general quietude of the geological processes in the past. The con-

clusions drawn from the nature and arrangement of the sediments are corroborated

and much extended by the structure and manner of entombment of the enclosed
organic remains. From the time of the very earliest fossiliferous formations there

is nothing to show that either plants or animals have had to contend with physical

conditions of environment diflerent, on the whole, from those in which their suc-

cessors now live. The oldest trees, so far as regards their outer form and internal

structure, betoken an atmosphere neither more tempestuous nor obviously more

impui-e than that of to-day. The earliest corals, sponges, crustaceans, molhisks, and

arachnids were not more stoutly constructed than those of later times, and are

found grouped together among the rocks as they lived and died, with no apparent

indication that any violent commotion of the elements tried their strength when

living or swept away their remains when dead.

     But, undoubtedlj', most impressive of all the palaeontological data is the testi-

mony borne by the gi-and succession of organic remains among the stratified rocks

as to the vast duration of time required for their evolution. Professor Poulton

Wehas treated this branch of the subject with great fulness and ability.  do not

know the present average rates of organic variation, but all the available evidence

goes to indicate their extreme slowness. They may conceivably have been more

rapid in the past, or they may have been liable to fluctuations according to vicissi-
tudes of environment.^ But those who assert that the rate of biological evolution

ever differed materially from what it may now be inferred to be, ought surely to bring

forward something more than mere assertion in their support. In the meantime,

the most philosophical course is undoubtedly followed by those biologists who in

this matter rest their belief on their own experience among recent and fossil

organisms.

     So cogent do these geological and palaeontological arguments appear, to those at

least who have taken the trouble to master them, that they are worthy of being
employed, not in defence merely, but in attack. It seems to me that they may be

used with effect in assailing the stronghold of speculation and assumption in which

our physical friends have ensconced themselves and from which, with their feet, as

they believe, planted well within the interior of the globe and their heads in the

heart of the sun, they view with complete unconcern the efforts made by those who

endeavoiu- to gather the truth from the surface and crust of the earth. That por-

tion of the records of terrestrial history which lies open to our investigation has

Abeen diligently studied in all parts of the world.  vast body of facts has been

gathered together from this extended and combined research. The chronicle regis-
tered in the earth's crust, though not complete, is legible and consistent. From

the latest to the earliest of its chapters the story is capable of clear and harmonious

interpretation by a comparison of its pages with the present condition of things.

We know infinitely more of the history of this earth than we do of the history of

the siui. Are we then to be told that this knowledge, so patiently accumulated

from innumerable observations and so laboriously co-ordinated and classified, is to

be held of none account in comparison with the conclusions of physical science in

regard to the history of the central luminary of our system ? These conclusions

are founded on assumptions which may or may not correspond with the truth.
They have already undergone revision, and they may be still further modified as

our slender knowledge of the sun, and of the details of its history, is increased by

future investigation. In the meantime, we decline to accept them as a final pro-

Wenouncement of science on the subject.  place over against them the evidence

of geolofry and palffiontology, and affirm that unless the deductions we draw from
that evidence can be disproved, we are entitled to maintain them as entirely borne

out by the testimony of the rocks.

Until, therefore, it can be shown that geologists and palaeontologists have mis-

interpreted their records, they are surely well within their logical rights in claiming

as much time for the history of this earth as the vast body of evidence accumulated

by them demands. So far as I have been able to form an opinion, one hundred

millions of years would suffice for that portion of the history which is registered in

the stratified rocks of the crust. But if the palajontologists find such a period too
narrow for their requirements, I can see no reason on the geological side why they

should not be at liberty to enlarge it as far as they may find to be needful for the

evolution of organised existence on the globe. As I have already rema,rked, it is

not the length of time which interests us so much as the determination of the

relative chronology of the events which were transacted within that time. As to
Wethe general succession of these events, there can be no dispute.
                                                                    have traced

its stages from the bottom of the oldest rocks up to the surface of the present con-

Wetinents and the floor of the present seas.  know that these stages have followed

each other in orderly advance, and that geological time, whatever limits may be

assigned to it, has sufficed for the passage of the long stately procession.

   We may, therefore, well leave the dispute about the age of the earth to the

decision of the future. In so doing, however, I should be glad if we could carry

away from it something of greater service to science than the consciousness of
having striven our best in a barren controversy, wherein concession has all to be on

one side and the selection ot arguments entirely on the other. During these years

of prolonged debate I have often been painfully conscious that in this subject, as in

80 many others throughout the geological domain, the want of accurate numerical

data is a serious hindrance to the progress of our science. Heartily do I acknow-

ledge that much has been done in the way of measurements and experiments for
the purpose of providing a foundation for estimates and deductions. But infinitely

more remains to be accomplished. The field of investigation is almost boundless,
for there is hardly a department of geological dynamics over which it does not
extend. The range of experimental geology must be widely enlarged, until every
process susceptible of illustration or measurement by artificial means has been
investigated. Field-observation needs to be supplemented where possible by
instrumental determinations, so as to be made more precise and accurate, and more

capable of furnishing reliable numerical statistics for practical as well as theoretical

deductions.

    The subject is too vast for adequate treatment here. But let me illustrate rny

meaning by selecting a few instances where the adoption of these more rigid

methods of inquiry might powerfully assist us in dealing with the rates of geo-
logical processes and the value of geological time. Take, for example, the wide
range of lines of investigation embraced under the head of Denudation. Sp
voluminous a series of observations has been made in this subject, and so ample is

the literature devoted to it, that no department of geology, it might be thought,

has been more abundantly and successfully explored. Yet if we look through the
pile of memoirs, articles, and books, we cannot but be struck with the predominant

vagueness of their statements, and with the general absence of such numerical
data determined by accurate, systematic, and prolonged measurement as would
alone furnish a satisfactory basis for computations of the rate at which denudation

takes place. Some instrumental observations of the greatest value have indeed
been made, but, for the most part, observations of this kind have been too meagre

and desultory.

   A little consideration will show that in all branches of the investigation of

denudation opportunities present themselves on every side of testing, by accurate
instrumental observation and measurement, the rate at which some of the most

universal processes in the geological regime of our globe are carried on.

     It has long been a commonplace of geology that the amount of the material
removed in suspension and solution by rivers furnishes a clue to the rate of denu-

dation of the regions drained by the rivers, But how unequal in value, and
728 REPORT-- 1899.

Agenerally how insiifEcient in precision, are the observations on this topic !  few

rivers have been more or less systematically examined, some widely varying

results have been obtained from the observations, and while enough has been
obtained to show the interest and importance of the method of research, no ade-

quate supply of materials has been gathered for the purposes of accurate deduction

and generalisation. What we need is a carefully organised series of observations

carried out on a uniform plan, over a sufficient number of years, not for one river

only, but for all the important rivers of a country, and indeed for all the greater

Werivers of each continent.  ought to linow as accurately as possible the extent

of the drainage-area of each river, the relations of river-discharge to rainfall and

to other meteorological as well as topographical conditions ; the variation in the

proportions of mechanical and chemical impurities in the river-water according to

geological formations, form of the ground, season of the year and climate. The
whole geological regime of each river should be thoroughly studied. The admi-
rable report of Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot on the ' Physics and Hydraulics of

the Mississippi,' published in 1 SGI, might well serve as a model for imitation,

though these observers necessarily occupied themselves with some questions which

are not specially geological and did not enter into others on which, as geologists,

we should now gladly have further information.

     Again, the action of Glaciers has still less been subjected to prolonged and

systematic observation. The few data already obtained are so vague that we
may be said to be still entirely ignorant of the rate at which glaciers are wearing
down their channels and contributing to the denudation of the land.

The whole of this inquiry is eminently suitable for combined research. Each

stream or glacier, or each well-marked section of one, might become the special

inquiry of a single observer, who would soon develop a paternal interest in his

valley and vie with his colleagues of other valleys in the fulness and accuracy of

his records.

    Nor is our information respecting tbe operations of the Sea much more precise.
Even in an island like Great Britain, where the waves and tides effsct so much
change within the space of a human lifetime, the estimates of the rate of advance

or retreat of the shore-line are based for the most part on no accurate determina-

tions. It is satisfactory to be able to announce that the Council of this Association

has formed a Committee for the purpose of obtaining full and accurate information

regarding alterations of our coasts, and that with the sanction of the Lords of the

Admiralty the co-operation of the Coast-guard throughout the three kingdoms has

Webeen secured.  may therefore hope to be eventually in possession ot trust-

worthy statistics on this interesting subject.
     The disintegration of the surface of the land by the combined agency of the

Subaerial forces of decay is a problem which has been much studied, but in regard
to whose varying rates of advance not much has been definitely ascertained. The

meteorological conditions under which it takes place difi'er materially according to

latitude and climate, and doubtless its progress is equally variable. An obvious

and useful source of information in regard to atmospheric denudations is to be

found in the decay of the material of buildings of which the time of erection is
known, and in dated tombstones. Twenty years ago I called attention to the rate
at which marble gives way in such a moist climate as ours, and cited the effects of
subaerial waste as these can be measured on the monuments of our graveyards and

cemeteries. "^ I would urge upon town-geologists, and those in the country who
have no opportunities of venturing far alield, that they may do good service by

careful scrutiny of ancient buildings and monuments. In the churchyards they
will find much to occupy and interest them, not, however, like Old Mortality, in

repairing the tombstones, but in tracing the ravages of the weather upon them,

and in obtaining definite measures of the rate of their decay.
     The conditions under which subaerial disintegration is effected in arid climates,

and the rate of its advance, are still less known, seeing that most of our informa-

tion is derived from the chance observations of passing travellers. Yet this branch

' Proc, Boy. Sop, Fdin, vol. x. (1879-SO), p. i318,

of the subject is not without importance in relation to the denudation not only of
the existino^ terrestrial surface but of the lands of former periods, for there is
evidence of more than one arid epoch in geological history. Here, again, a dili-

gent examination of ancient buildings and monuments might afl'ord some, at least,

of the required data. In such a country as Egypt, for instance, it might eventually
be possible to determine from a large series of observations what has been the
average rate of surface-disintegration of the various kinds of stone employed in

human constructions that have been freely exposed to the air for several thousand

years.

Closely linked with the question of denudation is that of the Deposition of the

material worn away from the surface of the land. The total amount of sediment
laid down must equal the amount of material abstracted, save in so far as the

soluble portions of that material are retained in solution in the sea. But we have
still much to learn as to the conditions, and especially as to the rate, of sedimenta-

tion. Nor does there appear to be much hope of any considerable increase to our

knowledge until the subject is taken up in earnest as one demanding and justifying

Wea prolonged series of well-planned and" carefully executed observations.  have

yet to discover the different rates of deposit, uuder the varying conditions in which

it is carried on in lakes, estuaries, and the sea. What, tor instance, would be a

fair average for the rate at which the lakes of each country of Europe are now

being silted up ? If this rate were ascertained, and if the amount of material

already deposited in these basins Avere determined, we should be in possession of

data for estimating not only the probable time when the lakes will disappear, but

also the approximate date at which they came into existence.

13 ut it is not merely in regard to epigene changes that further more extended

and concerted observation is needed. Even among Subterranean movements there

are some which might be watched and recorded with far more care and continuity

than have ever been attempted. The researches of Professor George Darwin and

others have shown how constant are the tremors, minute but measurable, to which

the crust of the earth is subject.^ Do these phenomena indicate displacements of

the crust, and, if so, what in the lapse of a century is their cumulative effect on

the surface of the land ?

More momentous in their consequences are the disturbances which traverse

Mountain-chains and ffnd their most violent expression in shocks of Earthquake.

The effects of such shocks have been studied and recorded in many parts of the

world, but their cause is still little understood. Are the disturbances due to a

continuation of the same operation which at first gave birth to the mountains ?

Should they be regarded as symptoms of growth or of collapse ? Are they accom-

Wepanied with even the slightest amount of elevation or depression ?  cannot

tell. But these questions are probably susceptible of some more or less definite

answer. It might be possible, for instance, to determine with extreme precision

the heights above a given datum of various fixed points along such a chain as the

Alps, and by a series of minutely accurate measurements to detect any upward or
downward deviation from these heights. It is quite conceivable that throughout

the whole historical period some deviation of this kind has been going on, thougli

so slowly, or by such slight increments at each period of renewal, as to escape
Weordinary observation.
                           might thus learn whether, after an Alpine earthquake,

an appreciable difference of level is anywhere discoverable, whether the Alps as

a great mountain-chain are still growing or are now subsiding, and we might be

able to ascertain the rate of the movement. Although changes of this nature may
have been too slight during human experience to be ordinarily appreciable, their

very ins gnificance seems to me to supply a strong reason why they should be

sought for and carefully measured. They would not tell us, indeed, whether a
mountain-chain was called into being in one gigantic convulsion, or was raised at

wide intervals by successive uplifts, or was slowly elevated by one prolonged and

continuous movemeut. But they might furnish us with suggestive information as

to the rate at which upheaval or depression of the terrestrial crust is pow

going on.

     The vexed questions of the origin of Raised Beaelies and Sunk Forests might iu
like manner be elucidated by well-devised measurements. It is astonishing upon

what loose and unreliable evidence the elevation or depression of coast-lines has
often been asserted. On shores where proofs of a recent change of level are
observable it would not be difficult to establish by accurate observation whether

any such movements are taking place now, and, if they are, to determine their rate.
The old attempts of this kind along the coasts of Scandinavia might be resumed
with far more precision and on a much more extended scale. Methods of instru-
mental research have been vastly improved since the days of Celsius and Linnjeus.

Mere eye-observations would not supply sufficiently accurate results. When the

datum-line has been determined with rigorous accuracy, the minutest changes of
level, such as would be wholly inappreciable to the senses, might be detected and
recorded. If such a system of watch were maintained along coasts where there is
reason to believe that some rise or fall of land is taking place, it would be possible

to follow the progress of the movement and to determine its rate.
     But I must not dwell longer on examples of the advantages which geology

would gain from a far more general and systematic adoption of methods of experi-
ment and measurement in elucidation of the problems of the science. I have
referred to a few of those which have a more special bearing on the question of

geological time, but it is obvious that the same methods might be extended into

almosi; every branch of geological dynamics. While we gladly and gratefully
recoo-nise the large amount of admirable work that has already been done by the

adoption of these practical methods, from the time of Hall, the founder of experi-

mental geology, down to our own day, we cannot but feel that our very apprecia-

tion of the gain which the science has thus derived increases the desire to see the

practice still further multiplied and extended. I am confldent that it is in this

direction more than in any other that the next great advances of geology are to be

anticipated.

While much may be done by individual students, it is less to their single

efforts than to the combined investigations of many fellow-workers that I look

most hopefully for the accumulation of data towards the determination of the

present rate of geological changes. I would, therefore, commend this subject to

the geologists of this and other countries as one in which individual, national, and

Weinternational co-operation might well be enlisted.  already possess an institu-

tion which seems well adapted to undertake and control an enterprise of the kind

suggested. The International Geological Congress, which brings together our

associates from all parts of the globe, would confer a lasting benefit on the science

if it could organise a system of combined observation in any single one of the

departments of inquiry which I have indicated or in any other which might be

Weselected.   need not at first be too ambitious. The simplest, easiest, and least

costly series of observations might be chosen for a beginning. The work might be

distributed among the diffisrent countries represented in the Congress. Each

nation would be entirely free in its selection of subjects for investigation, and

would have the stimulus of co-operation with other nations in its work. The

Congress will hold its triennial gathering next year in Paris, and if such an

organisation of research as I have suggested could then be inaugurated a great

impetus would thereby be given to geological research, and France, again become

the birthplace of another scientific movement, would acquire a fresh claim to the

admiration and gratitude of geologists in every part of the globe.

  1. On the Relation between the Dover and Franco- Belgian Coal Basins.
                            By Robert Etheridge, F.E.S.

     That the history of the stratified rocks of the south-east of England, and South-

eastern Kent in particular, is in a fair way of being determined there is little doubt,
    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  731

this being mainly accomplished through the numerous trials by boring at sites

selected where the probability of the continuity of tho Coal Measures may be

determined, westward, or beyond Dover, towards the South Somerset coalfield

or southern end of the Bristol coal basin.
     The physical identity of the coal-bearing district of Southern Somerset on the

west with the coalfields of Northern France and Belgium to the east was recognised
as far back as 1826, as well as the fact that the Coal Measures and their associated
or accompanying coals lie deeply buried under a variable thickness of Cretaceous

and Tertiary rocks.

     It now remains to practically trace and extend the Belgian and French coal-

fields further west from Dover, which it is believed will ultimately prove to
constitute a continuous chain of isolated coal basins extending to the northern
side of the Mendip Hills to join the exposed coalfield of Nettlebridge and Vobster
south of the Radstock and Farrington basins.

     The Dover boring, carried down to the depth of 2,225 feet, has shown that the
deeper coals are of the same character as the rich bituminous coals of Mons and
Briiay, but thicker; the four lower seams at Dover unitedly measure 13 feet. The
extent of the unexplored area between Dover and the Great Western coal track,

originally included in the South Wales, Somerset and Gloucester, or Bristol coal-

field, is about 160 miles.
     The upper series or the Hadstock and Farrington basins, which lie above or

rest upon the thick Pennant sandstones, contain the thin but finest bituminous
coals, which appear upon analysis to correspond chemically with the coals at Dover
and those of the French and Belgian basins, especially those of Mons and

Valenciennes.

     The lower coals proved at Dover appeared to be of as high a class as the
Radstock, and also will compare with the thirty-seven samples of Welsh coals
which were analysed by Sir JB. De la Beche and Dr. Lyon Playfair in 1850.

732 REPORT-- 1899.

     This area is partly Westplialian and east of the Rhine, followed west by the
coalfields of Aix-la-Chapelle and Liege; the great east and west fields of Hainaut,
comprising Namur, Charleroi, and Mons; then succeeded west by the prolific

coalfield of Valenciennes, in the Pas-de-Calais.
     That thefe coal basins were originally connected, and extended from the

Rhine and Eastern Belgium to Somersetshire immediately north of the Mendip
Hills, is now admitted.

     Their mean thickness, where taken in their most complete series, shows similar

results, as given in the following table :

    The coal basins of Belgium and France owe their origia oi' geological and
geographical position to the one great line or axis of disturbance which can be
traced from the south of Ireland to Frome (Somei'setshire) through the Pembroke,
South Wales, and southern end of the Somersetshire coalfield, and parallel to the
disturbed axis of the Mendlp Hills, to Mells, Elm, Nunney, and Frome, then lost
under the unconformable overlap of the Jurassic and Cretaceous strata of Wilts,
Hants, Sussex, and South-east Kent, until again revealed and determined through
the two, if not three, deep and remarkable borings, that of West Brabourne,
5 miles east of Ashford, to the depth of 2,003 feet. The partly completed and
important boring at Ropersole, south of Barham, 1,773 feet (3 inches, and the
pioneer borehole by Mr. F. Brady at Great Fall, west of Dover, in 1892, to the
depth of 2,225 feet, and now the site of the two deep coalpits, immediately west of

the Shakespeare Tunnel. Mr. Brady's trial proved the thickness of the overlying
Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks to be 1,112 feet, touching the true Coil Measures at
1,113 feet, terminating with the four-foot seam of coal at 2,225 feet, but the tloor
of the Dover Coal Measures Is yet unknown.

     In Belgium and North France the Carboniferous rocks have been persistently
and practically followed along a given line, but in England the Coal Measures of
Gloucestershire and Somersetshire have not been traced eiistwards, or beyond the
well-defined eastern escarpment of the Bristol and Somerset coalfield, ranging
from north to south from Tortworth to Frome, or from the eastern end of the
Mendlp range beyond Frome.

   We now know without doubt the range and thicknesss of the Jurassic rocks

below the overlying Cretaceous series in South-east Kent at Braboume, Ropersole,
and Dover, where the most complete succession has been determined, and a
complete series of the cores preserved, from the top of the Gault to tlie base of the
Lower Lias Inclusive, from the Brabourne borehole, and a Trlassic conglomerate
new to this area, and also the French and Belgian line of coal basins.

-piwealth of fuel.
                   ·

    It is however, hy trial only that this important problem or question ot value can

be solved, and we are now obtainino; much insight into the intimate geological
structure of the coal-hearing rocks of the south-east of England, and Kent in par-

ticular · neither can we doubt the Continental relationship established between

Eastern France and Belgium with ourselves, with regard to the solution of so large
a problem as the westerly extension of their coalfields, and coals under the Straits
of Dover to meet the new enterprise at Dover, established upon and through the
practical knowledge obtained from the great works in the Borinage and the wealthy

coalfields of Hainaut.

     This naturally gives rise to the significant question, Are the coals at Dover, as

compared with the great and prolific coalfields of France and Belgium, within the

depth and capacity at which coal-mining can be carried on at a profit ?
     The eight workable seams at Dover commence at 1,113 feet from the surface,

the Coal Measures being proved to be 782 feet thick with 16 feet of workable coal,
the lowest or four-foot seam being reached at 2,225 feet 6 inches ; this is well within

the limit of practical working--many of the important coal pits in this country

are worked at much greater depths, ranging from 2,800 feet to over 3,000 feet.
     The Royal Commission of 1871, under the presidency of the Duke of Argyll,

appointed '"to look into the question of several matters relating to our coal in
the United Kingdom,' fixed the limit of safe working at 4,000 feet, on account of
the underground temperature at that depth being 98° or blood heat, hence the legal

limit of practical working to that depth.                                                                                           .,  ,

of what is now sea has been, and probably will again be, dry and continuous land.

We' may now regard this, for want of under-water testing, as probably one of the

north and south trough-like or transverse fractures occurring along or between the
severed coal basins between Calais and Westphalia and the valley of the Rhine,

notably those of Liege, Mons, Bristol and South Wales, &c.

    The interest and value attached to the discovery of coal at Dover is both

national and scientific; it is as much Continental as British--North France, Belgium,

and Western Germany have each and all been closely and physically united to us

by a series of now disunited yet connected and rich coal basins, occupying the

extended line between Dover and the Rhine valley marked and distinguished by

the great works at Valenciennes, Mons, Chaiieroi, Liege, and the Prussian province

of Westphalia.

   We must now bridge the Dover Straits and include the 22 miles of water, as

covering an additional and buried coalfield, the westerly termination of which is

now being practically tested, by the great undertaking beneath the far-famed cliffs

west of Dover, and 1 doubt not of its westerly development and continuity to the
northern side of the Meudip Hills, or to the exposed coalfield of Nettlebridge,

Holcombe, and Vobster, and this with ultimate success under our four great

masters--Patience, Perseverance, Money, and Time.

                By Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, M.A., F.R.S.

     The discovery of a coalfield in 1890 at Dover, in a boring at the foot of
the Shakespeare Clifi", has been already brought before the British Association
by the author at Cardiff" in 1892, and is so well known that it is unnecessary
to enter into details other than the following. The carboniferous shales and
sandstones contain twelve seams of coal, amounting to a total thickness of 23 feet
6 inches. These occur at a depth of 1,100 feet 6 inches below Ordnance datum,
and have been penetrated to a depth of 1,064 feet 6 inches, or 2,177 feet
6 inches from the surface. They are identical, as I have shown elsewhere,' with

 the I'icli and valuable coalfields of Somersetshire on the west, and of France and
 Belgium on the east. This discovery is of great practical value, as it will probably
 result in the same development in Kent of industries and manufactures which has
 taken place where the coal has been worked, under the same conditions, under the
 Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks in France and Belgium. It is of equally great

 theoretical value, as it proves up to the hilt the truth of Godwin-Austen's view,

 published in 1858, that the coal measures lie buried underneath the newer rocks in

 South-eastern England.

      After tbe boring was completed in 1893 the discovery lay dormant until in
 1897 the Kent Collieries Corporation began to sink shafts on the site of the borino-,
and to put down boreholes at Brabourne and Pluckley, in the Weald of Kent, to
verify the range of the coal measures in the property which they held under lease.

     The Mid-Kent Coal Syndicate also put down a boring at Penshurst, and the
Kent Coal Exploration Company began work in various parts of eastern Kent.

The borings of the two latter undertakings have been carried on under my super-

vision, and none of them, as yet, is completed. They, nevertheless", throw
important light on the range of the coal measures in South-eastern England, and
are not unworthy of being brought before this meeting of the British Association.

     The first boring to be noticed is at Ropersole, a spot near the highway between
Dover and Canterbury--eight miles from Dover, at 400 feet above 6.D.--the
surface being composed of Upper Chalk, with a thin stratum of Clay-with-Fiints, It
was begun at the close of 1897, and has at the present time pierced the strata to

a depth of 1,773 feet 7 inches.

     It is being carried out under the able superintendence of Mr. James Newton,
resident engineer, with the calyx drill, with the occasional use of a diamond
crown for the lower and harder rocks. The result in both cases is a solid core.

  --The coal measures contaiu the usual' carboniferous plants Sigillaria, Lepido-

dendron, and ferns, and the usual Stigmarian roots and rootlets, and, like those

which we struck in the borehole at Dover, are probably horizontal. The coal is

bright and blazing, and breaks up into little cubes, but shghtly deformed by
pressure into the lozenge-shape. In this respect it agrees with the coals of Dover,
and like them shows no sign of crushing. The horizontality of the beds in both these

cases may be accounted for by the boreholes happening to strike the bottom of a

carboniferous synclinal fold. This conclusion, -viewed in the light of the coalfields
of France and Belgium on the one hand, and of Somerset on the other, is more
probable than the view that they extend horizontally over a very large area.

     It is strengthened by the fact that the rocks, probably Devonian, struck at the
bottom of the borehole at Brabourne, some few miles to the west, are inclined at
a high angle. They here are a portion of an anticline which is probably related
to the coal measures above them, as the Devonian axis of the Mendip Hills is

related to the syncline of the Somerset coalfield.

    in my opinion the coal measures of Ropersole are a portion of the same series

as those at Dover. Here, as at Dover, the question of seams of coal resolves
itself probably into a question of sinking deeper. Here only two unimportant
seams have been met with in a thickness of 197 feet. There twelve seams were
penetrated in a thickness of 1,054 ifeet 6 inches, the thickest 4-feet seam being at

the bottom.

     The Ropersole boring establishes the fact that the Dover coal measures extend
northwards for a distance of eight miles and beyond in the direction of Canterbury.

    It remains now to see how far the range of the South-eastern coalfield has been
proved by other borings. None of the three others which are now being carried
ou by the Kent Coal Exploration Company at Ottinge, Hothfield, and Old Soar

to the north of Tonbridge has been carried deep enough to give any evidence.

We are, however, indebted to Mr. Etheridge ' for conclusive proof that its

south-western boundary does not extend as far to the south-west as Brabourne.

Here a fine-graiaed grey argillaceous sandstone, in my opinion Devonian, was

struck in a boring at a depth of 1,921 feet 5 inches from the surface, the strata
being inclined at a high angle, and being covered by a red dolomitic conglomerate
of Triassic age, just as similar rocks occur in the central axis of the Mendip Hills.
This boring has verified the exact position of the Peuibroke-Mendip anticlinal fold,
which I mapped in 1894.'^ It ranges in a north-west and south-easterly direction

close under the line of the Chalk downs from Folkestone to Wye, a few miles to

the north of the theoretical line of my map, and forms the southern boundary of

the South-eastern coalfield. In Somersetshire it emerges from beneath the
Triassic and Jurassic strata in Ihe Mendip Hills, and in Northern France along the
low hills sweeping from Hardinghen past Ferques in the direction of Cape Gris

Nez, where, as in the Mendip range, it is traversed by many faults.
     The coal measures set in in Kent at a sufficient distance to the north-east of

Brabourne to allow ofthe presence of the Carboniferous Limestone and Millstone Grit.
These probably dip at the same high angle as the Devonian below. Their south-
western boundary can only be accuratelj' defined by further borings such as that

which we are now carrying on at Ottinge, about two and a half miles to the north-

east of the scarp of the Downs, and six miles to the south-west of Ropersole. Their
range to the north and the east still remains to be proved. They are, however,
continued imder the Channel, and have been proved by the boring at Calais in
 1850 as well as those carried out in 18138 at Strouannes near Wissant. In this
district they are clearly shown by other borings to be faulted into the Devonian

and other pre-coal-measure rocks.
      The thickness and value of this South-eastern coalSeld can only be estimated

by the exposed coalfields of Northern Frf.nce and Belgium, and of Somerset.

apro;regate thickness of 212 feet of workable coal. That of Mons is 9,400 feet with
110 seams yielding 250 feet of coal. In Somersetshire the coalfield is 8,400 feet
thick, the seams are fifty-five in number, and yield 120 feet of available coal. It is

obvious from these figures that the possibilities of the South-eastern coalfield are very

great, although it still remains to be proved how far these great thicknesses of rock

have been denuded in Kent before the deposition of the Triassic and Jurassic rocks.
     The upper denuded surface of the South-eastern field was struck at Ropersole

at a depth of 1 ,373 feet 7 inches below Ordnance datum, and at Dover at
1,100 feet 6 inches. If the rocks which have to be traversed above O.D. be
added, the resulting figures of about 1,600 feet necessary to sink from the surface

are well within the depth to which coal is now being worked at a profit in

England and in France and Belgium. The coal is well within the 4,000-leet limit
laid down by the Coal Commission of 1872.

     The strata overlying the coal measures at Ropersole and Dover present points
of great geological interest bearing on the geographical conditions under which
they were formed, as may be seen from the following table :

scarp of the chalk downs. Its rangre in other directious is unknown, and awaits
further investigation. To the south of this anticline the palseozoic floor is
probably composed of pre-coal-measure rocks. If, however, the coal measures do

--occur, they are buried under such great thicknesses of superincumbent rock

largely sands and loams full of water that it will be difficult to work them.

We know now by experiment not only where to seek, but also where it is

advisable not to seek for the coal measures. The difficult problem of the buried
coal measures in South-eastern England, now being worked out by private enter-
prise, is likely to add greatly to the resources of this country, as it has already
added to the wealth of geological knowledge.

        3, Note on a Boring through the Chalk and Gault near Dieppe.

                      By A. J. Jukes-Browne, B.A., F.G.S.

     The following particulars of a boring for water made at Puys, near Dieppe, in

1898, have been communicated to me by Messrs. Le Grand & Sutclifl', the site of

the boring being about 45 feet above the sea, and not more than 50 yards from
high-water mark.

     The ' chalk without flints 'will correspond to our Lower and Middle Chalk,
and must include chalk which, on the English side, generally contains a few flints.
The two metres of greensand and sandy clay at the base of this is probably what
is generally known in England as Chloritic Marl, the zone of Stauronema Carteri,

which is 15 feet thick at Folkestone, but less beneath Dover.

    No sandy beds referable to ' Upper Greensand ' are recorded, and the Gault
seems to be entirely represented by clay, as at Folkestone and Dover. The black

sand with pyrites should doubtless be regarded as the basement bed of the Gault,
but the clean quartzose sand below is probably the equivalent of the highest part
of the Vectian or Lower Greensand.

   A good supply of water was found in these sands, rising to 12 feet above the

surface of the ground.

     From this boring it would appear that the Folkestone and Wissant facies of

the Gault extends southward as far as Dieppe, a distance of about 52 miles.

4. So7ne Recent Work among the Upper Carboniferous Rocks of North

    Staffordshire, and its hearing on concealed Coal-fields. By Walcot

      Gibson, F.G.S.

  [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

     There is every reason to believe that in the near future the supplies of coal

lying beneath the Red Rocks of the Mdland counties will have to be relied upon

to meet the increasing demand.
     Workable seams of coal have been met with at reasonable depths beneath the

Red Rocks surrounding the South Staff'ordshire coalfield, but there remain large
areas lying between the known coalfields of Shropshire, North Staff'ordshire, and

Nottinghamshire, which have not at present been explored. Within this region,

as sliown on the published maps of the Geological Survey, there are considerable
areas of so-called Permian rocks, which recent investigations have proved to be
conformable to the upper coal-measures, and to contain a coal-measure flora.

Thus Mr. T. C. Cantrill has shown that in the forest of Wyre the so-called Permian

rocks contain thin coal-seams and bands of Spirorbis limestone.*

     Exceptional facilities afibrded by numerous marl- and brick-pits and other
artificial and natural exposures in North Stattbrdshire have enabled Mr. C. B.

Wedd and myself to make out the following definite stratigraphical sequence in the

Upper Carboniferous Rocks :

Variability in the character of the deposits of the coal-measures is universal,

so that it is hardly to be expected that this sequence will be recognisable in its

entirety over the whole Midland area                                                                                                                                                                                but there  can  be  no  doubt                                                                       that  it  is  an

important point to find out which of these divisions occurs at the surface in the

areas at present regarded as Permian or as upper coal-measures on the published

maps.

     Already the determination of the successive divisions above noted has had
important industrial bearings. The fact that the Newcastle limestone lies at the

base of grey measures intercalated between an upper group of red strata (the

Keele series) and a lower group of red strata (the Etruria marls) has enabled me

to detect true upper coal-measures in Keele Park, Shutlanehead, and to the west

of Leycett. Moreover, there seems to be little doubt that the coal-measures of the
Pottery Coalfield lie not far from the surface under Little Madeley and Craddocks

Moss. Evidence has been obtained that the strata on the north-west side of the
North Staffordshire anticline do not uninterruptedly descend beneath red rocks

(so-called Permian) to the west of Leycett, but rise locally westward under Hayes.
The effect of this change of inclination is to bring to the surface strata which lie
considerably below the unproductive red series, and to bring the principal coals
and ironstones within reach further west than might have been expected.-

     It follows that a thorough and complete examination of the exposed coalfields

of the Midland counties and of the bordering New Red Rocks will be of the highest

importance in determining at what depth the productive measures lie beneath the

great central tracts of the Midland counties.

6. Note on Barium Sulphate in the Bunter Sandstone of North Staffordshire,

                            By C. B. Wedd, B.A., F.G.S.

[Commnnicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

Special attention has been directed by Professor F. Clowes to the deposition

of barium sulphate as a cementing material of Triassic sandstone near Nottingham,

and he has mentioned numerous places, on the authority of Mr. J. Lomas, where

the same mineral has been observed in Triassic rocks.

It may be interesting to record another locality. In a cutting of the North

Staffordshire Railway (Audley Branch), three quarters of a mile south of Alsager

Road (Talke) >Station, a section of Bunter sandstone in Merelake Hill shows the

cross-like marks common in the Keuper sandstone of Cheshire and Staffordshire,

Aand due to barium sulphate crystals.  partial analysis, made by my friend Mr.

R. Hornby, of the Red Bunter sandstone of Merelake Hill, showed a considerable

quantity of barium sulphate. Occasional veins filling joints consist of baryto-

celestite, which may also be seen in other sections of the Bunter of Merelake Hill.

The following Papers and Reports were read :

1. The Bholo-microfjraphy of Opaque Objects as applied to the Delineation

    of the Minute Structure of Fossils. By Dr. Arthur Rowe, F.G.S.

The object of the paper is not to enter into minute technical details of the

process, but rather to demonstrate upon the screen the scope and limitations of the

Aphoto-micrography of opaque objects.  contrast was drawn between the

technique employed in the case of transparent and opaque objects, and it wa.s

pointed out that, simple as are the broad principles of the latter, the application of

these principles is a very difficult and tedious matter. AUusion was made to the

methods used by the author, and the advantages of various lenses and illuminants

were discussed.

The author stated that incandescent gas had proved quite satisfactory in his

hands, and that it had been used throughout all his experiments. It was pointed

out that rapid exposure was no object, and that it was useful to have a light which,

while sufficiently white and powerful for all purposes, gave one ample margin

wherewith to vary exposures, and that the real difficulty lay not so much in the

choice of an illuminant as in the way in which it was managed. The lighting of

an object would always be a somewhat tedious process, and each specimen had to

be treated on its merits.

The limitations to the power of a lens were mentioned, and it was stated that

it was impossible to expect any lens to focus details lying on separate horizontal

Anplanes.  instance of this difficulty was furnished by the ambulacral grooves of

      ' Proc. Roy. Soc, vol. Isiv. p. 374. References to previous papers are given in
this article.

Micraster, and tlie author demonstrated the methods employed to retain the

accuracy of detail, and yet to convey the impression of the depth of the

ambulacra.

     Allusion was made to the weariness of eye and brain caused by the fre-
quent use of a hand-lens, and a contrast noted between this course and the use of
photo-micrographic prints for obtaining broad and detailed observations of small

objects. It was pointed out that with the aid of photographic prints the palaeon-

tologist and the artist could meet on level terms, and that the draughtsman would

by this means be enabled to see the value of minute detail as plainly as the trained

observer. Further, such was the excellence of the results obtained, that the assist-

ance of an artist could in most instances be dispensed with altogether, and the

Aphotographs rendered in collotype and autotype.  proof of the latter assertion

was aflbrded by showing numerous silver-prints of Bryozoa and sea-urchins, and by

the set of collotype plates which illustrated the author's recent paper on the genus

Micraster.'

The question of expense is an important one, for in the paper mentioned six

hundred negatives were taken to illustrate the details of the test, and it is obvious
that the cost of employing an artist to make drawings of even a portion of these

details would be prohibitive.

The demonstration was illustrated by fifty lantern-slides of sea-urchins, Bryozoa,

Brachiopoda, and Foraminifera, and care was taken to show examples which would

bring out the shortcomings as well as the advantages of the process.

2. WateV'Zones : Their Injluence on the Situation and Growth of Concretions.

                               By G. Abbott, M.B.C.S.

    Many hold the theory that concretions are due to the presence of organic

remains, and apparently claim that some centre is necessary for their formation.

The author thinks that many may be otherwise explained, and calls attention to

the effects produced by the rain-water which passes into and saturates a rock-

atructure. He has noticed on surfaces of sections and of walls of buildings that

as soon as percolation has come to an end in beds which are horizontal, or nearly
so, the water breaks up into horizontal lines or water-zones, and subsequently these
lines are broken up into moist patches of unequal length, extending across a
section in definite lines, as illustrated by the photographs which he exhibits.

     Hence the soluble substances of the rock, especially lime, iron, and silica,
will be brought by the saturation water into positions favourable for the growth
of crystalhne and amorphous masses, and these substances as evaporation goes on

must be redeposited in new situations, which may or may not coincide with the
position of fossils. The space through which the dissolved substances may travel
before being deposited has not been determined, but in many cases one or two feet

seem to be sufficient.
     The author has observed these zones of moisture both on sandstone and lime-

stone, and thinks it possible that the selective work may go on in the same way
in clay. Many disconnected facts relating to concretionary growth appear to be

explicable in this manner, but further inquiry will be necessary to decide what
are the special influences at work regulating the growth and deciding the form,
and whether the concretion shall be amorphous or crystalline.

3. Tubular atul Concentric Concretions. By George Abbott, M.R.C.S.

     After excluding stalactites and pseudomorphs from the list of tubular concre-
tionary bodies there yet remain a remarkable series of rings and cylinders which
aflbrd no obvious explanation of their existence. They consist chiefly of lime,
silica, and iron, and no other substances appear to possess this peculiar property.

                                              ' (?.J.6?.5. Aug. 1899, vol. Iv.
5^42 REPORT-- 1899.

It seems also to be a rule for these bodies to occasionally exhibit concentric

Aarrangement.    recent instance of this re-deposit of material is very frequent in

weathered mortar, whether usad as a cement for sandstone, limestone, or igneous

rocks. So far, I have never failed to discover examples of this in whatever town

or village I have searched. Both in dolomite and oolite beds, at Fulwell, Cress-

well Crags, and Isle of Portland, tubes and channels, often concentrically arranged,

are to he met with quite distinct from ordinary drainage channels. These are

probably due to the same influence, a hydrostatic or mechanical one, which

causes the segregation in the mixture of sand and lime used as mortar. The cone-

in-cone rings seen in coal from Merthyr Tydvil may be due to the same selective
power or growth, for, from an analysis made for me by Mr. E. T. Andrews, they

contain lime and alumina in about equal parts.

myBoth flint paramoudra and the flint circles near Cromer should, in           opinion,

come under this division of concretionary bodies and no longer be supposed to be

fossil sponges.

Beekite, the geodes from Uruguay, and the variety of agate with * eyes,' afi'ord

innumerable examples of annular formation, diflering in arrangement from the

mortar only by the smaller size of the circles. Both chalcedony and opal must be

recognised as possessing this power to produce circles and ' fortifications ' onjlat

surfaces quite irrespective of the contour lines of the cavities in which the agates

are formed.

Iron cylinders in the Folkestone beds of the Lower Greensand exist in large

numbers as single tubes, clusters, and concentric tubes. As yet, I believe, no one

has found any sign of organic remains in association with them. In all proba-

bility they are due, like the other instances mentioned, to some special arrange-

ment or concentration of solutions in the beds. They are met with to a smaller

extent in the Trias, near Exeter, the Wealden of the south-east of England and

other rock beds. They give little, perhaps no evidence of pressure, and are gene-

rally found in horizontal positions, so cannot be supposed to be stalactitic.

WeThe actual cause or origin of these formations is not very clear.   may call

it segregation, but this does not carry us far. Whilst further study may add to

our knowledge of the influences which favour their growth, we may be just as

ignorant as to why they grow as the crystallographers are of the similar pro-

cesses in crystals. I surmise, however, that we shall ultimately find that some

hydrostatic influence will explain much that is at present both mysterious and

perplexing.

4. On Photographs of Sandstone Pipes in the Carboniferous Limestone at
            Dwlbau Point, East Anglesey. By Edward Greenly.

    At Dwlbau Point, Tied AVharf Bay, certain beds in the Carboniferous Lime-
ptone are traversed by remarkable funnel-shaped pipes filled with tine hard sand-
stone. The sandstone filling the pipes can be seen to be continuous with that of
overlying sandstone beds, from the lower side of which the pipes pass down into

an underlying limestone. Most of the pipes are about six feet wide at the top,
and have been followed to a depth of some six or seven feet. There are, however,
smaller ones ; and one much larger is seen in section to a depth of twelve or
fifteen feet. The sandstone of the pipes is bedded, and there appears also to be a
concentric structure. It is obvious that they are due to contemporaneous erosion,
though of an exceptional kind.

     The photographs show pipes in various stages of denudation, some standing up
four or five feet from the surface of the foreshore.

tlie sandstone pipes the strire are deflected, and sweep round, till on its landward

or S.S.W. side they are running as much as 20° N. of W. This is on a conrex

surface of limestone, forming the side of a moat-like depression, about a foot wide

at the top and the same deep, running round the mass of sandstone filling the pipe.

A short distance away, a low face of limestone is not merely furrowed, hut under-

cut. It is smoothed and striated in the usual maimer, and is undercut some two
or three inches, the overhanging surface being as much as 15°, and in parts even
30° from the vertical. It would seem that these cflects must have been produced
by an agent which moulded itself lilie a plastic body to the face of the rock. The

ice-worn surfaces are overlaid by about ten feet of reddish boulder clay, poor in

stones.

 G. On the Glacial Drainage of Yorkshire. ^^ Percy F. Kendall, F.G.S.

     The author referred to the effects produced when the edge of a glacier or ice-

 sheet obstructed the rivers of the adjacent country, ponding up the water to pro-
 duce a lake, whose overflow was carried over into some neighbouring valley as a
 river. Sometimes the overflow would cross the main watershed, while at other times

 it would pass into some minor valley of the same slope. In this way single lakes or

 chains of lakes are formed, discharging by valleys cutting across spurs and ridges.

 Where lakes of this description existed during the Glacial Period their traces may

 be left after the withdrawal of the ice in the form of beach lines, silt deposits,
 deltas of inflowing streams, and abandoned overflow channels. In the famous
 Glenroy lakes the beaches and deltas are the noticeable features, but in Yorkshire
the author has relied chiefly upon the streamless river valleys marking the overflow,
though other indications often exist. These valleys present marked features. They
are deep, sharply cut, and the character of their windings shows that they were
occupied by large rivers. Moreover they often trench flat plateaux, from which
they received no commensurable tributaries, and cut completely through main
watersheds or projecting spurs.

      The author describes the distribution of the ancient glaciers of Yorkshire,
showing that while the Pennine Valleys were occupied by separate ice streams the
Vale of York was covered by a great glacier. The edge of the Scandinavian ice-
sheet abutted upon the whole coast line, and pressed against tbe northern face of
the Cleveland Hills. The whole drainage of the district was obstructed, and Mr.
Strangways long ago recognised that the Vale of Pickering was converted into a
lake which drained backward across the natural watershed, which became trenched
by the beautiful gorge of the Derwent at Castle Howard. The author's investiga-
tions showed that Newtondale was the overflow of another great lake in Eskdale,
but a lobe of the Scandinavian ice-sheet crossed the Cleveland watershed near
Egton, and stood against the hills above Grosmont, which was severed by two
streamless gorges forming a connection between the main lake and a lesser one at
Goathland. Lakelets fringed the edge of the ice along the outer face of the Cleve-
land Hills from Swainby to Stonegate, and for the most part drained one into
another until some overflow into Eskdale was encountered. As the ice shrank by
the series of stages new channels were cut at lower level across the spurs, and in
some cases water flowed round the end of a lobe of ice as it stood against the slope
of the hills, and thus curious ' in and out' valleys were cut, as near Freeborough.
Robin Hood's Bay was drained by four successive outlets which cut through the
amphitheatre of hills, and which are splendidly shown on the road from Scar-
borough to Whitby. The beaches of the old lakes were seldom visible, for the
outlets, being cut through very soft rocks, were lowered too rapidly for well-defined
beaches to be formed, but gravel deltas, where the overflow of one lake entered the
quiet waters of another, were of frequent occurrence, the largest being that on which
the town of Pickering is built. The floor deposits of the lakes are also well seen.

On the western side of the Vale of York, near Ilipon, the features are some what

different. The lateral moraine of a great glacier is clearly traceable extending
from Kirkby Malzeard to Nidd Hall. As the glacier advanced the eastward-flowing
streams were successively ponded up into lakes, which overflowed each into its

neighbour on the south, and finally out into the Vale of York. On the retfeat of

the ice some of the streams fell back through gaps in the moraine into the old
valleys, leaving the extramorainic channels as practically dry gorges. One of
these, Cayton Gill, was three miles long, and its excavation involved the removal
by stream action of nearly three million tons of rock.

            7. On the Origin of Lateral Moraines and Rock Trains.
                           By J.LoMAS, A.E.C.S., F.G.S.

     In dealing with the accumulations of fragmentary materials associated with
glaciers it is necessary to distinguish between deposits which are stationary and
the debris riding on, or moving with the ice.

     The latter, reviving a term used by liendu, will be referred to as ' rock trains,'
and the meaning of 'moraines' will be restricted to stationary deposits, either

lateral or terminal.
      Lateral onoraines are not necessary adjuncts to glaciers. Their distribution,

which appears capricious, really conforms to a well-defined law. In glaciers with
a straight course, they are feebly, if at all, developed, whereas those moving
through winding channels have lateral moraines developed in their concave bends.
The debris carried by a glacier either in the ice or on the surface gradually works
towards the side in such places where motion is retarded and carrying power
reduced. In this respect they conform exactly to the action of rivers which

deposit material in their inner bends.

     Bock trains may appear suddenly in the middle of a glacier or at the junction

of two streams. The first are undoubtedly caused by the erosion of sub-glacial
spurs or crags. Those formed at the point of union of two glaciers are usually
regarded as being formed by the joining together of two lateral rock trains.

      There are cases, however, where rock trains are formed at the junctions of
glaciers, and no lateral rock trains fringe the tributary glaciers. In front of the
rocky islands or spurs which separate the glaciers at the point of confluence, a
hollow is always seen in which a lakelet often exists. This is the counterpart of
the hollow on the down-stream side of a river after passing under a bridge
supported by piers.

     Objects carried by rivers tend to accumulate in this hollow, and may linger

there a long time before they join the main current and get carried away.

     Thus rock trains may be formed by debris being thrust out of glaciers at

similar places where motion is small. In these instances the fragments are
 probably torn oft' under the ice from the flanks of the dividing spurs, and they

may be compared with those originating in the middle of a glacier.

   8. Note on the Origin of Flint. By Pbofessoe W. J. SoLLAS, F.R.S.

      The first stage was the conversion of the calcareous remains of the organisms
 of the chalk into silica. The siliceous foraminifera and coccolithes so produced
 were cemented by a deposition of silica into white flint, and this by a further
 deposit of silica became converted into black flint, just as snow might be trans-
 formed into compact ice. This had been shown by the author in 1880. The source
 of the silica might be looked for in the remains of siliceous organisms such as
sponge spicules, and Professor SoUas said he was now able to bring positive proof
of the original existence of abundant spicules in the chalk which were now repre-
sented by hollow casts to the extent sometimes of 3 per cent, of the rock.

9. Calcareous Confetti and Oolitic Structure. By H. J. Johnston-Lavis,

                                           M.D., D.Ch., F.G.S.

      The older geologists, unaided by the microscope, considered oolitic granules as
concretionary bodies, aa they did also pisolites and other spherical bodies found ia

sedimentary deposits.
                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                              745

Recently au author has attempted to overthrow the physico-chemical origin

and replace it by a vital one.
    Some granules in certain so-called oolitic rocks have been shown to he of

undoubted organic origin.
     The present paper is au attempt to compare these granules with identical con-

cretions the origin of which is known, and the formation of which can be observed

in progress.

     The microscopic sections sho^vn are a series from specimens kindly collected

from the vicinity of Cheltenham by Mv. Gray, and for comparison are several sec-

tions of somewhat similar structures, found at the present day, unquestionably

inorganic.

The true oolites and pisolites are seen to be concentric grains and masses of very

variable dimensions in which three grades of crystallisation can be seen.

In one, fragments of rock, shell, or other organic remains have been enveloped

in crystalline calcite minutely saccharoidal in structure.
     In another similar nuclei have been enveloped in very distinctly marked con-

centric bands of radiating needle-like or fibrous calcite.

In a third, the enveloping material is finely granular, dirty, with the concentric

bands very imperfectly marked.

AU these gradate into each other, and, what is more, alternate with each other

Wein the same grain or pisolite.  have here nothing more than the varying con*

ditions of slowness, turbidity, and movement of the water or other solution in which

they were formed.

In studying oolites, the first question which arises is whether these structures were

formed coincident with the deposit or as a secondary structure set up subsequently.
The author thinks that the former is the true state of tilings.

     Accepting as granted that oolitic and pisolitic structures were coincident with

the formation of the deposit in which we find them, the conditions necessary are

nuclei, a solution of bicarbonate of lime, and gentle motion.

     In the first specimens shown was a section of a calcareous granule from the
galleries of La Gardette mine near Bourg d'Oisans. The galleries have been

abandoned for some years, and the calcareous water dropping from the roof has

formed small pools in which granules of rock are churned up as each drop falls, and

receives an infinitesimal coating of carbonate of lime. This process is a fairly rapid

one, as the mine has not been abandoned for many years, and yet very thick crusts
may often be found. Another specimen is from a gallery of quite modern date,
cut into the side of Monte-Somma to catch the Olivella spring, and here we find

the same rapid deposition of the concentric crystalline layers identical and often

more perfect than in ordinary oolitic grains. The third and most striking examples

are similar confetti from the mines of Laurium (Greece), where in small pools in

the ancient galleries the most beautiful highly polished examples have been found.

So far all of these are formed in very shallow pools of calcareous water, or

have not even been immersed but only moistened by the liquid. The process is

identical with the method adopted for depositing sugar from its solution in water

in the manufacture of sugared almonds, 'cannon balls,' and other varieties of

confetti, the only difference being the separation in the former case of the lime

by loss of COo ; in the second, the evaporation in the rolling pans of the water
by heat.

    The formation of confetti when completely immersed occurs in the mineral
water springs at the mud volcanoes of Paterno in Sicily. There, traversing

fissures in a basalt, are springs of water supersaturated with C0._, and a large
quantity of bicarbonate of lime. These gush out with considerable violence, and
keep in constant movement the grains of basalt or other solid loose fragments, as

we frequently see in any spring. This supersaturated water reaches the surface
under decreased pressure, much of the CO, escapes, and a deposit of CaCOj takes

place on the walls of the fissure and on' the grains that are being constantly
churned up in the unstable solution. The specimens exhibited show examples of

the great perfection of this concretionary structure, which is identical with that
                                           --

746 REPORt-- 1899.

of stalactites and stalagmites, and teing on a microscopic scale tte autlior sug«

gests the term ' micro-stalagmitic ' to indicate this structure.
     Such structures are not limited to those formed from carbonate of lime.

Urinary concretions of uric acid, urates, oxalate of lime, often show this structure

to perfection.

    Sea-water as a solvent of carbonate of lime and a retainer of OOj is still much
of a problem, notwithstanding many researches. As a general statement, deep-
sea water may be said to contain more of these materials than surface-water,

because it is under greater pressure and cooler. With currents setting from great

depths to more shallow regions, the water will rise in temperature and diminish

Nowin pressure, and so lose its bicarbonate of lime.  we know that oolitic rocks

--were chiefly shallow water and shore deposits, and here we have all the elements

favourable to the formation of oolites namely, supersaturation of water by lime

bicarbonate and constant rolling movement. Another and perhaps equally import-

ant source must be the innumerable calcareous springs from land drainage issuing

all over the sea-bottom for miles from the shore, churning up sand and depositing

their burden of calcite at the same time.

1. Homotaxy and Contem2yoraneity. By Professor W. J. Sollas, F.R.S.

    On the occasion of the centenary of William Smith's great discovery of the

identification of strata by fossil remains, which formed the basis of historical
geology, attention might fitly be called to the triumphs of the last two decades
which had been achieved by its means. The study of the distribution of zonal
fossils had unexpectedly vindicated the old-fashioned notion of the contem-
poraneous formation of similar stratified systems over great parts of the world,
and no one could any longer assert that the Silurian system in Europe might
possibly be contemporaneous with the Devonian in America. The distribution of
Ammonites in the Cretaceous zones of Europe, America, and Pondicherry could
be shown to prove that the difierence in age of the same zone in different locaUties
was not equal to the whole time required for a species to migrate from one place
to another, but to the difference in the times occupied by Pacific species in passing
to Europe, and Atlantic species in passing to Asia. Further, the lapse of time
during migration or transport was a vanishing quantity in comparison with the
long periods occupied in the evolution of species. The results of recent work had
been to inspire geologists with renewed confidence in the accuracy and logical
basis of their methods.

                 2. Note on the Surface of the Moiint Sorrel Granite.

                          By W. W. Watts, M.A., F.G.S.

     It has long been known that, when first exposed in the quarries, the granite of
Mount Sorrel exhibits a smoothed, groOTed, and slightly terraced aspect. As the
surface, when first discovered, was covered with boulder-clay, it has been concluded
that it was produced by glaciation. The writer has long had doubts with regard
to this interpretation, and recent excavations near Mount Sorrel have thrown a new

light on the phenomenon. At Hawkley Wood and Nunckley Hill similar but

smaller surfaces have recently been exposed which are covered by undisturbed Keuper

Marl, while another surface, exposed at Nunckley Hill, has boulder-clay abutting
on it. Thus the grooving, terracing, and smoothing, like so much of the scenery in

Charnwood Forest, was originated in Triassic times, though locally it may have
been somewhat modified by glaciation. One loose block of granite, apparently

removed in baring the surface of the rock, presents characteristic fluting and
glazing like that due to the action of wind. The writer wishes to thank Mr. R. F.

Martin for calling his attention to these newly exposed sui-faces.

--3. On the Origin of Chondritic Meteorites. By Professor A. Renard.

                  4. On Coast Erosion. By Captain McDakin.

     The district dealt with is the coast from Deal to Dover, Folkestone and

Sandgate.

     The Six-Inch Ordnance Survey, 1877, is taken as the standard. Several
noted falls are mentioned.

     The comparatively slow action of the unaided sea, ascertained by boring holes

in the clifis, has been recorded.

     The more rapid effect, where the waves are charged with a small quantity of
shingle, and the absolute barrier thi'own up by the sea when it forms large banks

of shingle.

     The important part played by the springs is dwelt upon as one of the chief
causes constantly at work.

     The disintegratory power of the frosts and the accumulation of water on the
hollow surfaces of the usual pervious chalk, due to the freezing of the otherwise

porous surface.

    The moisture-absorbing power of the chalk, which amounts in many instances,

especially in that of the Upper Chalk, to over 20 per cent.
     The compression of air in the joints and fissures of the rocks by an incurving,

on-rushing wave, are all factors influencing the coast erosion.

     The writer is of opinion that although the falls of the cliS" amount to thousands

of tons, the area lost has not been great in historic times, for the Roman light-

house at Dover Castle, and the foundations of a similar structure on the westeru
heights, show that their position with regard to the coast is very much the same

now that it was nearly two thousand years ago.
     The more rapid destruction of the Dover cliff's within the last fifty years is

curiously due to those structures that might be supposed to protect the coast, the
breakwaters at Dover and Folkestone, which intercept the shingle that would
otherwise form a natural protection to the coast.

The connotation of the word ' wave,' which is becoming customary from the

Special aspects of waves most studied in physics, is that of transmission of energy

in a pulse-like manner, attention being concentrated on a process and diverted

from the thing produced. This is well enough e.g. in the physical study of light,

where the structures produced are obliterated almost as soon as formed ; but it is

not the right point of view in geology, where the structure frequently outlasts the

process, and the process of production is by no means always a pulse-like trans-

mission of energy. The primary and principal meaning of ' wave ' (noun) in our

language ' is properly associated with (1) up and down motion, (2) with a
systematically corrugated surface, an onward rushing mound of water ; the notion

of pulse transmission comes in but slightly.

The most fruitful source of the waves which constitute geological structures

is the relative motion of two bodies which yield viscously at their common sur-

Anface.  undulating interface is an almost invariable result of such movements,

whether of a lighter air over a heavier, giving clouds in parallel bars, or sometimes

blown-sand ripples, sand dunes, or waves of drifted snow ; or hydrosphere and

non-rigid parts of lithosphere, giving ripple-mark of the seashore, tidal ripple-

mark of estuaries, sand banks, ripple-drift, ' sand reefs,' «&c. ; or between parts of

the lithosphere, when the relative movement is slow enough to allow them to

behave viscously. In this case of slow wave formation, pulse-transmission may

be present, but difficult to observe directly. Moreover, the structures are often

studied in the ' fossil ' state, e.g. rock-folds, when no longer part of the living

rock.

Sudden interruption of such slow wave-making {e.g. fold passing into fault, the

wave ' breaking ') brings out elastic effects, and waves such as those of earthquake
ehock become possible, in which the pulse-transmission-of-energy-aspect of waves

of permanent waves.

behaves in a rigid manner, the free surface of the upper moving viscous body

     The author stayed about a week at the Hermitage on Vesuvius, in September,
1808, when the eruption was about at its height.

   A lava cone has been thrown up at the entrance of the Atrio del Cavallo, the

slopes of which reach to the foot of Somma on the west side, the cone of Vesuvius

on the east, and nearly to the Hill of the observatory on the S. V/ , and a prolonga-

tion of the latter, the Crocella, described as of great beauty, has been entirely

covered up. The eruption has been going on gently in this locality for about two
years, but has never been very active. Small streams of lava have been almost
constantly poured out, but they have all cooled and solidified before reaching the
foot of the mountain, and consequently have assumed the form of a cone rather
than a large sheet.

     The lava in the early part of the eruption had been of the corded variety. In
September 1808, that which was being poured out was scoriaceous.

     Lantern photographs from negatives by the author wore exhibited, some of

which have been reproduced in the ' Alpine Journal, May 1899.

feet of lava was poured forth from a crater on the southern flank. On July 19
a Plinian eruption occurred in the central crater, during which a great number
of ejected blocks of old lava were scattered round the crater to a distance of
over 4,000 feet. Some of the blocks damaged the roof of the Observatory. It
is suggested that this Plinian eruption is a symptom of an impending lava erup-
tion, which will produce a rift in continuation of that of 1892 in the Valle del

Bove.

1. The Geological Conditions of a Tunnel under the Straits of Dover.

            By Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, M.A., F.R.S.

     In 1882 the physical structure of the cliffs on the English and French sides of
the Straits was brought by the author before the British Association. Since that
time the question of a tunnel has been relegated to a future more or less remote,

while many new facts have been ascertained. It is not, therefore, inopportune to

recur to the subject, which has a special interest for the place of our present

meeting.

     The rocks exposed in the cliffs between Folkestone and St. Margaret's, and
measured for the purposes of the proposed tunnel, are as follows, in descending

order :

     The Gault, a stiff blue impervious clay, forms a low line of clifl's on the west
side of Eastwear Bay, and disappears beneath low-water mark, opposite the
western end of the Abbotscliffe. It occurs in St. Margaret's Bay in Sir John
Hawkshaw's boring at a depth of 536 feet below O.D.

     The Glauconitic Marl, No. I., a clayey calcareous deposit, generally impervious,
but sometimes so fuU of grains of glauconite and sand as to be pervious, overlies the
Gault and passes into the chalk marl, underlying the Lower Grey Chalk, No. II.
This sets in in the cliff" traversed by the Folkestone Tunnel at 360 feet above O.D.,
and descends to Ordnance datum, a little to the east of Shakespeare's Clifi'. It con-
stitutes the base of the clift' from Abbotscliffe as far as that point.
TRAXSACTIOXS OF SECTION C.  751

     From this point as far as the west base of Eastcliffe, the cliffs are composed of

 the Middle Chalk Nodular, and White, No. III., rising on the west to 490 + O.D.,-

and plunging down to the east to a depth of 180 -- O.D. at St. Margaret's. At its

 base is a hard nodular iron-stained layer, the Grit-bed of Price, forming a con-
 spicuous band in the English and French clifts. The three upper members of the
 section constitute the Upper Chalk, out of which tfie cliffs between Dover and St.

 Margaret's have been carved.
       All these strata dip steadily to the east at an inclination of about 1 in 72.

     On the French side, in the cliffs between St. Pot and Sangatte, the Lower and

 Middle Chalk of the English section emerge from the sea with physical characters
the same, and the thickness practically also the same. They dip also to the east,

 but at a higher angle.
      The French survey of the sea bottom in the Straits foi- the purposes of the pro-

 posed tunnel proves that the Lower and Middle Chalk are perfectly continuous

 and constitute the sea floor, the sea in the line of the tunnel being 192 feet in depth

 at the deepest point.

      It is obvious that the geological structure of the Straits of Dover offers great
 facilities for the construction of a tunnel, which would descend at an inclination
of 1 in 70 or 80 on the English, sweep imder the Channel and rise with the
strata on the French side, if it can be made in an impervious stratum which cannot
be traversed by the sea water under high pressure. The only stratum satisfying this
condition is the Lower Grey Chalk, and especially the lower and more clayey

horizon overlying the Glauconitic Marl.

    A careful examination also of the clifis proved that the faults, mostly small and

insignificant, do not become water passages at this place in the section, because
they become blocked with clay. There are no springs at this horizon in either the

English or the French cliffs.
      These considerations led the Channel Tunnel Companies to sink the shafts at

the Shakespeare Cliff and at Sangatte down to this horizon, and to make their
drifts on the English side 2,300 yards long, and on the French more than a mile,
passing diagonally away from the shore under the sea. The selection is amply
justified by their experience. On the English side the faults visible in the Shake-
speare Cliff were traversed, and yielded a slight oozing of water, which was stopped

by rings of iron tubing. These rings were afterwards removed and the faults
were found to be perfectly water-tight. The water in the French shaft comes from
the fault intersected at a point considerably above the level of the drift, which

here also traversed small water-tight faults.

     The chalk is here soft enough to be easily cut by Colonel Beaumont's machine,
and hard enough to stand without lining. Five years' exposure has not sensibly
affected the surface of the drift, which remains as fresh as the day when it was
made. The geological conditions are therefore peculiarly favourable for the con-
struction of a submarine tunnel at the bottom of the Chalk, and do not present any

engineering difficulty.

2. On a Proposed Neio Classification of the Pliocene Deposits of the East of
                      England. By F. W. Haemer, F.G.S.

    The term Red Crag, including, as it does, beds differing considerably in age, is
vague and, when we attempt to correlate the East-Anglian deposits with those

of other countries, inconvenient ; the Scaldisien zone of Belgium, with its southern
fauna, for example, representing one part of it, and the Amstelien of Holland, in

which northern and even arctic moUusca are common, another.
     It seems desirable, therefore, while retaining it for general use, to adopt for its

various horizons some more definite and distinctive names.
     The upper Crag deposits arrange themselves geographically, in horizontal rather

than in vertical sequence, assuming always a more recent as well as a more boreal
character as we trace them from south to north. They are the littoral accumula-
tions of a sea which was from time to time retreating in a northerly direction.

    An analysis of the characteristic mollusca of the different divisions respectively

of the Crag here suggested shows a gradual diminution of the percentages of
extinct and southern forms, and a gradual increase in northern and recent species.
The difference between the Gedgravian (Coralline Crag) and Waltonian is shown
to be less than has been supposed, and the former is here grouped as Newer instead

of as Older Pliocene, as hitherto.

     The Crag of Little Oakley, near Harwich, from which the author has recently
obtained nearly 300 species of mollusca, belongs to an horizon different from any-
thing previously described, and serves to bridge over the interval between the Crag
of Walton-on-the-Naze and that of Suffolli. Its fauna closely resembles that of
AValton, but contains some boreal and arctic species unknown from that place,
including Neptunea (intiqua (dextral), N. cavinatn, and N. despecta, and repre-
sents the period when northern forms were tirst beginning to establish themselves
in the Crag basin. It is approximately and partly equivalent to the Poederlien

zone of Belgian geologists.

     The Red Crag beds, the fossils of which are, with few exceptions, the drifted

and stratified shells of dead mollusca, seem to have been deposited either against
the shore, or in shallow water in proximity to it, in land-locked bays or inlets.
The position which these inlets successively occupied was from time to time
shifted towards the north, in consequence of the upheaval of the southern part of
the Crag area, described by the author in a former paper." These inlets were silted
up, one after another, by masses of shelly sand, but as far as the evidence goes the
beds composing the different zones do not overlap. The Waltonian deposits
are confined to the county of Essex, the Newbournian occupying the district to
the north of the river Stour, and the Butleyan beds occurring along a narrow belt
extending northwards from Bawdsey at the mouth of the river Deben. The
Icenian deposits, which are found only to the north of Aldeburgh , are shown by their
molluscan fauna to belong to a period considerably more recent than any part; of

the Red Crag. They cover an area 45 miles hy 20 in extreme breadth, and in one
place are nearly 150 feet in thickness, but they are not anywhere known to be
underlaid by beds of Red Crag age. In the northern part of the Icenian area
Astarte borealis occurs, and this species seems to mark a slightly more recent
horizon of this zone. The Weybournian Crag, containing Tellina balthica, is only
known to the north of Norwicb, and extends from thence to the Cromer coast.
The author now believes that these latter beds are distinct from, and of older date

than, the Westleton shingle of Prestwich.

    3. The Meteorological Conditions of North- Western Europe, during the

          Pliocene and Glacial Periods. By F. W. Harmek, F.G.S.

     No satisfactory explanation has yet been offered as to the conditions under
 which originated the great sheets of shelly sand known to geologists as the Upper

 Crag, the littoral deposits of the North Sea in Pliocene times, which contain
 everywhere (over an area in East Anglia more than sixty miles in length) the

dead shells of mollusca in the most extraordinary profusion. No such accumu-
lations are now taking place on the shores of Norfolk and Suffolk, although

molluscan life is more or less abundant in the adjoining seas. On the coast of
Holland, on the contrary, dead shells are exceedingly common.

      The occurrence of such debris is local rather than general, and seems to be due

sometimes to currents, but more frequently to the action of stormy winds, which

agitate the sea bottom to a greater or less depth. An examination of the daily

weather charts issued by the Meteorological Office shows that movement of dead
shells towards the shore at any place is for the most part in the direction of the
gales which may there be prevalent. At present the cyclonic disturbances, to which

East-Anglian storms are due, pass as a rule with their centres to the north-west

of that district ; and hence south-westerly and westerly gales are there common,
 and shelly debris is driven on to the shores of Holland, and not on to those of the
east of England. It would seem, therefore, that during the Pliocene epoch,
strong winds from the east must have prevailed in the Crag area. At an early
stage of the Red Crag period, mollusca now confined to the Arctic Circle had begun
to establish themselves in the Crag basin, so that the glaciation of Scandinavia,

attended with anticyclonic conditions over that country, had probably then com-

rnenced. At present, when Scandinavia is anticyclonic, storm centres may be
diverted from their usual course towards the south, as was the case, for example,

in October 1898, causing south-easterly and easterly gales, with rough sea, on

the eastern coasts of England. It is suggested that such conditions may have

frequently prevailed there during the Crag period.

     The meteorological conditions of the northern hemisphere during the Glacial
epoch must have been widely different from those of our own time. At present the
accumulation of ice sheets in the Arctic regions is local rather than general

Greenland, for example, being glaciated, while the north of Scandinavia enjoys a

milder climate. The latter is due partly to the Gulf Stream, but partly also to
the prevalence of south-westerly winds, caused by the relative positions occupied
by areas of high and low pressure. Nansen states that a constant area of high
pressure now exists over Greenland, and that the winds blow outwards from that

country in all directions. Similar conditions probably obtained during the Glacial
period over the great ice sheet of northern Europe, producing the most far-
reaching changes on the climate of different parts of the northern hemisphere
and this may, to some extent, explain the local character of the accumulation of

great masses of snow and ice during that epoch.

group as affording traces of man's presence before the formation of the existing

river systems.

The implements of the plateau and hill drift are extremely rude, and bear

evidence of rough usage and  transportation                                                          vs^hile they diti'er in type from those

   A large collection recently formed by Mr. R. Jones, of East Wickham, con-

tains many interesting examples, which were exhibited by the author. Amongst

the localities from which these have been derived are Swanscombe, Milton Street,

Ash, Darent, Crayford, &c., and also a remarkable series found at Eainham, a

Anew locality, here at only about 20 feet above high-water mark.                                     large

number of Palseolithic implements were found on the surface, but they appear to

have been derived from an old gravel ; they are for the most part deeply stained

white or yellow, and are highly patinated, whilst also showing signs of con-

siderable wear on their worked edges. The question is, Have they been brought

down to this low level from the high-level drifts of the Medway Valley ?

        --1. Sigmoidal Curves. By Maria M. Gordon, D.Sc.

    The phenomena of crust-torsion are produced when the wave-forms existing in
an already folded region are altered as a result of the superposition of a new series
of folds. Let a unit-area of rectangular folds be taken as a type, where two anti-
clines and an intervening trough in east and west direction have been crossed by
two anticlines and an intervening trough in north and south direction. Then the

cross-arches are four in number, and are areas of uprise limiting obliquely an inner

cross-trough, which represents a common reciprocal area of depression. The new

anticlines east and west of the trough are areas of uprise, while north and south of
the trough the old anticlines are broken by local areas of depression.

     The redistribution of the wave-forms in the area determines several distinct
centres towards which crust-creep sets in, and the conflicting nature of the com-
bined horizontal and vertical pressures in relation to the separate centres produces
torsional phenomena. The inner trough is an area of involution, into which the
higher horizons of rock sink and are carried obliquely downward, while each of
the four cross-arches are areas of evolution where the compensatory opposite move-
ments of torsion carry the lower horizons of rock or molten material from below

the crust obliquely upward. ' Streaming ' of the rock-particles is associated with
this circulatory system of crust-movement.

     S' '-folds gradually take shape around the cross-arches, and as these are
specially liable to be fractured in their most warped, ' middle limb ' portions,
limiting-faults tend to form in oblique directions and to become continuous with
north and south faults between the simple lateral arches and the reciprocal troughs.
The outcrop of the fault-zone in the unit-area, therefore, describes characteristic
TRA^"SAC'^OXS OF SECTION c.                                       755

sigmoldal curves, tlie same curves practically which would be followed by the
outcrop of intermediate horizons of the crust in any ground-plan of the unit-area

of torsion.

    Among the tectonic phenomena which may be demonstrated in a unit-area of

torsion are the arrangement of the horizons of the stratigraphical succession in
elliptical whorls set at right angles, the formation of crust-folds in opposite or
sometimes intersecting arcs, and of faults in ' fault-polygons ' and ' bundles,' the
cross-transferences of rock-material, the fan-structure of cross-arches, and the dis-
position of consolidated fault-rock in sigmoidal bands. These phenomena become

much more complicated when the unit-area is considered as part of a much larger

area of torsion, since the varying magnitudes and varying shapes of the wave-
forms in a large region of cross-arches and troughs necessarily cause all kinds of

local structural peculiarities.

     Sigmoidal curves limit the great mountain-masses and troughs of the Alpine
system, and are associated there {ex. Prattigau, Salzkammergut, &c.) with all the

above-mentioned phenomena of crust-torsion. What is designated a Central

Massive or a major Trough in the Alpine mountain system really represents a very
large wave-form, which bears upon its surface a number of smaller wave-forms
represented by the subordinate cross-arches and covered troughs in each great

Massive or Trough.

5. On the Subdivisions of the Carboniferous System in certain portions of
    Nova Scotia. By H. M. Ami, M.A., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey

      of Canada.

     Considerable discussion has arisen of late in Canada regarding certain sediments,

near the summit of the Palffiozoic columns. No doubt exists as to the proper and

natural succession, but whether the red sandstones and shales and conglomerates
of the Union formation, and the grey and dark carbonaceous shales and sandstones
of the Riversdale formation of Pictou, Colchester and Cumberland counties of
Nova Scotia should be classed as Carboniferous or Devonian was the problem
which presented itself to Canadian geologists.

     From a careful collection of palseontological material in the formations in

question, the writer has been able to satisfy himself that the Union and Riversdale
stratahold a flora and a fauna which in every essential feature are truly Carboniferous.
The plants obtained were submitted both to Professor David White of Washington,
and to Mr. Kidston of Stirling, Scotland, and they both recognise a distinctly
Carboniferous flora.

    The Ostracoda were examined by Professor T. Eupert Jones, F.R.S., who
reports that the forms have a decidedly Carboniferous facies. The wing of a large

neuropterous insect is referred to a Carboniferous genus by Professor Charles
Brongniart. Reptilian and fish remains, tracks and trails of the former all serve
to point to post-Devonian times.

     To assign such a fauna and a flora as are found in the Union and Riversdale
formations of Nova Scotia to the Devonian period would be contrary to the con-
sensus of opinion and generally accepted inferences of the leading geologists in
the world, and contrary to the principles of classification.

     The various life-zones of these two formations, as well as the characters of the
sediments due to the conditions in which they were deposited, serve to unite them

                                                                                                  3c 2

in every respect with the similar sediments which went on in the Millstone Grit

and the Coal Measures in later Carhoniferous times.

  -- --These two terrigenous formations the Union and Eiversdale are separated

from the Millstone Grit and Coal Measures of the same district by a series of lime-
stones of marine origin, associated with certain sandstones and mudstones, which
point to a period of subsidence when the Carboniferous sea encroached upon the
land and deposited limestones, holding abundance of the remains of the sea life of
those days. The shallow water, estuarine and terrigenous characters of the Union
and Piiversdale formations (eo-Carboniferous) caused by the conditions of deposition
had ceased for a period, and when the marine conditions which followed had
ceased, the former conditions recurred, and similar shallow water, estuarine and
terrigenous deposits, were deposited, and constituted the Millstone Grit and produc-
tive Coal Measures of the Springhill, Pictou, and Jogglns coalhelds. For these

reasons these two eo-Carboniferous formations are so classed.
      In the study of the succession and classification of the fossiliferous and associated

strata in certain portions of Nova Scotia, together with the life-zones they contain,

it has been deemed necessary at the present stage of our study to introduce certain

names to describe better the various formations under discussion, and the following
synoptical table may serve to present them in a condensed manner :

                        THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

The President delivered tlie following Address

   Variation and some Phenomena connected tvith Reproduction and Sex.

In the following address an attempt is made to treat the facts of variation and
heredity without any theoretical preconceptions. The ground covered has already
been made familiar to us by the writings of Darwin, Spencer, Galton, Weismann,
Romanes, and others. I have not thought it advisable to discuss the theories of

my predecessors, not from a want of appreciation of their value, but because I was

anxious to look at the facts themselves and to submit them to an examination
which should be as free as possible from all theoretical bias.

Zoology is the science which deals with animals. Knowledge regarding

animals is, for convenience of study, classified into several main branches, amongst

the most important of which may be mentioned : (1) the study of structure

(2) the study of the functions of the parts or organs; (3) the arrangement of

animals  in  a  system  of  classification                                                  (4)  the  past history of animals                                                                                                                 (5)  the
                                                                                         ;                                                                                                                                                 ;

relatione of animals to their environment; (6) the distribution of animals on the

earth's surface. That part of the Science of Zoology which deals with the func-

tions of organs, particularly of the organs of the higher animals, is frequently

spoken of as Physiology, and separated more or less sharply from the rest of

Zoology under that heading. So strong is the line of cleavage between the work

of the Physiologist and that of other Zoologists, that this Association has thought

it advisable to establish a special Section for the discussion of physiological subjects,

leaving the rest of Zoology to the consideration of the old-established Section, D.

In calling attention to this fact, I do not for one moment wish to question the
advisability of the course of action which the Association has taken. The Science

of Physiology in its modern aspects includes a vast body of facts of great import-
ance and great interest which no doubt require separate treatment. But what I

do wish to point out is that it is quite impossible for us here to abrogate all our

functions as physiologists. Some of the most important problems of the physio-

logical side of Zoology still remain within the purview of this Section.

For instance, the important and lar-reaching problems connected with repro-

duction and variation are very largely left to this Section, and that large group

of intricate and almost entirely physiological phenomena connected with the

adaptations of organisms to their environment are dealt with almost exclusively

here. Indeed, we may go further, and say that apart altogether from practical

questions of convenience, which make it desirable to separate a part of physio-
758 REPORT-- 1899.

logical work from the Zoological Section, it is, as a matter of fact, impossitjle to
divorce the intelligent study of structure from that of function. The two are

indissolubly connected together. The differentiation of structure involves the

diiferentiation of function, and the differentiation of function that of structure.

The conceptions of structure and function are as closely associated as those of
Amatter and force.
                    zoologist who confined himself to the study of the structure

of organisms, and paid no attention to the functions of the parts, would be as

absurd a person as a philologist who studied the structure of words and took no

account of their meaning. In the early part of this century, when the subject

matter of zoology was not so vast as it is at present, this aspect of the case was

fully recognised, and one of the greatest zoologists of the century, whether con-
sidered from the point of view of modern anatomy, or of modern physiology,

was Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at the University of Berlin.

Having said that much as to the various aspects of living Nature, of natural

history, if you like, which it falls within the province of this Section to deal with,

I may now proceed to the subject of my address. And when I mention to you

what that subject is, you will be able to make some allowance for the somewhat

commonplace remarks with which I have treated you. For that subject, though

it has its important morphological aspects, is in the main a physiological one ; at

any rate, no study which does not take account of the physiological aspect of it
can ever hope to satisfy the intellect of man. The subject, then, to which I wish

to draw your attention at the outset of our proceedings, is the great subject of

Variation of Organisms.

As every one knows, there is a vast number of different kinds of organisms.

Each kind constitutes a species, and consists of an assemblage of individuals which

resemble one another more closely than they do other animals, which transmit

their characteristics in reproduction and which habitually live and breed together.

But the members of a species, though resembling one another more closely than

they resemble the members of other species, are not absolutely alike. They pre-

sent difierences, differences which make themselves apparent even in members of

the same family, i.e. in the offspring of the same parents. It is these differences

to which we apply the term variation. The immense importance of the study of

variations may be judged from the fact that, according to the generally received

evolution theory of Darwin, it is to them that the whole of the variety of living

and extinct organisms is due. Without variation there could have been no pro-

gress, no evolution in the structure of organisms. If offspring had always exactly

resembled their parents and presented no points of difference, each succeeding

generation would have resembled those previously existing, and no change, whether

backwards or forwards, could have occurred. This phenomenon of genetic varia-

tion forms the bedrock upon which all theories of evolution must rest, and it is

only by a study of variations, of their nature and cause, that we can ever hope to

obtain any real insight into the actual way in which evolution has taken place.

Notwithstanding its importance, the subject is one which has scarcely received

from zoologists the attention which it merits.

Though much has been written on the causes of variation, too little attention

has of late years been paid to the phenomenon. Since the publication of Darwin's

great work on the ' Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,' there

have been but few books of first-rate importance dealing with the subject. The

most important of these is Mr. William Bateson's work, entitled ' Materials for

the Study of Variation.' I have no hesitation in saying that I regard this work as

a most important contribution to the literature of the Evolution theory. In it

attention is called, with that emphasis which the subject demands, to the supreme

importance of the actual study of variation to the evolutionist, and a systematic

attempt is made to classify variations as they occur in Nature. In preparing this

book Mr. Bateson has performed a very real service to zoology, not the least part

of which is that he has made a most effective protest against that looseness of

speculative reasoning which, since the publication of the ' Origin of Species,' has

marred the pages of so many zoological writers.

The Variations of Organisms may be grouped under two heads, according to
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                                       759

their nature and source : (1) There are those variations which appear to have no
relation to the external conditions, for they take place when these remain un-

changed, e.g. in members of the same litter ; they are inherent in the constitution
of the individual. These we shall call constitutional variations, or, as their

appearance seems nearly always to be connected with reproduction, they may be

called genetic (congenital, blastogenic) variations, (2) The second kind of varia-
tions are those which are caused by the direct action of external conditions.

These variations constitute the so-called acquired characteis.

    My first object is to consider these two kinds of variations, their nature, their

causes, and their results on subsequent generations, and to inquire whether there
are any fundamental differences between them. In this connection it is of par-

ticular importance that we should inquire whether acquired modifications are
transmitted in reproduction. As is well known, there are two schools of thought

--holding directly opposite views as to this matter. The one of these schools the
--so-called Lamarckian school holds that they may be transmitted as such in re-

production ; the other school, on the other hand, maintains that acquired modifi-
cations affect only the individual concerned, and are not handed on as such in

reproduction. That the decision of the matter is not only theoretically important,

but also practically, is evident, for upon it depends the answer to the question

whether mental or other facilities acquired by the laborious exercise of the indi-

--vidual are ever transmitted to the offspring whether the facility which the

individual acquires in resisting temptation makes it any easier for the offspring to

do the same, whether the effects of education are cumulative in successive genera-
tions. To put the matter as Francis Galton has put it, is nature stronger than

nurture, or nurture than nature ?

   We have then two kinds of variation to consider : (1) genetic variation, (2)

-- --acquired modification. It is theformerof these namely, genetic variation with

which I wish primarily to deal. Let us examine more fully the mode of its

occurrence.

Genetic Variation.

Organised beings present, as you are aware, two main kinds of reproduction,

the sexual and the asexual. These two kinds of reproduction present certain difl'er-

ences, of which the most important, and the only one which concerns us now, is

the fact that genetic variation is essentially associated with sexual repi-oduc-

tion, and is rarely, if ever, found in asexual reproduction. In other words,

whereas the offspring resulting from asexual reproduction as a rule exactly

resemble the parent, they are always different from the parents in sexual reproduc-

tion. I am aware that I am treading on disputed ground. You will observe that I

do not make the assertion that asexually produced offspring always exactly resemble

the parent, and never present genetic variations. To say that would be going too far

in the present state of our knowledge. Therefore I have put the matter less

strongly, and merely assert that whereas asexual reproduction is en the whole

characterised by identity between the offspring and the parent, sexual reproduction

is always characterised by differences more or less marked betvi^een the two ; and

I reserve the question as to whether genetic variations are ever found in asexual

reproduction for later consideration.

This modified form of the statement will, I think, be admitted on all hands, but

mybefore going on I will illustrate    meaning by reference to actual examples.

Asexual reproduction is a phenomenon comparatively rare in the animal king-

dom, and when it does occur it is exceedingly difficult to investigate from this

particular point of view. In the vegetable kingdom, on the other hand, it is

quite common. All, or almost all, plants possess tliis power, and in a very
great many of them the result of its exercise can be fully followed out, and con-

trasted with that of sexual reproduction. Let us follow it out in the potato-plant.

The potato can and does normally propagate itself asexually by means of its under-

ground tubers. As you will know, if you take one of these and plant it, it gives

rise to a plant exactly resembling the parent. If the tuber (seed as it is sometimes

erroneously called) be that of the Magnum Bonum, it gives rise to a plant with
760 REPORT-- 1899.

foliage, flowers, and tubers of the Magmim Bonum variety ; if it be of the Sndwdrop,
the foliage, flowers, habit, and tubers are totally different from the Magnum
Bonum, and are easily identified as Snowdrops. In this way a favourable variety

of potato can be reproduced to almost any extent with all its peculiarities of earli-
ness or lateness, pastiness or mealiness, power of resisting disease, and so forth.

By asexual reproduction the exact facsimile of the parent may always be obtained,

provided the conditions remain the same.

   Now --let us turn to the results of sexual reproduction the seeds, i.e. the real

seeds, which as you know are produced in the flowers, are the means by which
sexual reproduction is efl'ected. They are produced in great quantity by most
plants, and when placed in the ground under the proper conditions they germinate
and produce plants. But these plants do not resemble the parent. Try the seed
of the Magnum Bonum potato, and raise plants from it. Do you think tbat any of
them will be the Magnum Bonum with all its properties of keeping, resisting dis-
ease, and so forth ? Not a bit of it. The probability is, that not one of your

seedling plants will exactly reproduce the parents ; they will all be different.

Again, take the apple ; if you sow the seed of the Blenheim Orange and raise
young apple-trees, you will not get a Blenheim Orange. All your plants will be
different, and probably not one will give you apples with the peculiar excellence of

the parent. If you want to propagate your Blenheim Orange and increase the
number of your trees, you must proceed by grafting or by striking cuttings, which

are the methods by which such a tree may be asexually reproduced. And so on.

Examples might be multiplied indefinitely. Every horticulturist knows that
variety characterises seedlings, i.e. sexual offspring, whereas identity is found in
slips, grafts, and offsets, i.e. in asexual offspring ; and that if you want to get a
new plant you must sow seeds, while if you want to increase your stock of an
old one you must strike cuttings, plant tubers, or proceed in some analogous

manner.

    An apparent exception to this rule is afforded by so-called bud variation, but

it is not certain that this is really an exception. In so far as these bud variations

are not of the nature of acquired variational produced by a change of external con-

ditions, and disappearing as soon as the old conditions are renewed, they are pro-

bably stages in the growth and development of the organism. That is to say, they
are of the same nature as those peculiarities in animals which appear at a particu-

lar time of life, such as a single lock of hair of a different colour from the rest of the

hair,'' the change in colour of hair with growth,^ the appearance of insanity or of
epilepsy at a particular age. There is nothing more remarkable in a single bud on
a tree departing from the usual character at a particular time of life, than in a

particular hair of a mammal doing the same thing.

   We have seen that, speaking broadly, genetic variation is connected with sexual

reproduction, and it becomes necessary to examine this mode of reproduction a

little more fully. What is the essence of sexual reproduction, and how does it
differ from asexual? What I am now going to say applies generally to the

phenomenon whether it occurs in plants or animals. Sexual reproduction is

--generally carried on by the co-operation of two distinct individuals these are

called the male and female lespectively. They produce, by a process of unequal
 fission which takes place at a part of their body called the reproductive gland, a
small living organism called the reproductive cell. The reproductive cell produced
by the male is called in animals the spermatozoon, and is different in form from
 the corresponding cell produced by the female, and called in animals the ovum.
 The object with which these two organisms are produced is to fuse with
 one another and give rise to one resultant uninucleated organism or cell,

 which we may call the zygote. This process of fusion between the two kinds

 of reproductive cells, which are termed gametes, is called conjugation. The
 difference in structure between the male and female gamete is a matter of

 secondary importance only, and is connected with the primary function of

      ' Darwin, Variatio'n, vol. i. p. 449.                Darwin,  Variaiion,

    ' As an example I may refer to the Himalayan rabbit ;

vol. 1. p. 114,
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  7G1

comin* into contact and fusing. The same may be said with regard to the

so-called sexual difl'erences of the parents of the two kinds of gametes, and to the
powerful instincts which regulate their action. The conjugation of the male and
female gamete, or the fertilisation of the ovum, as it is sometimes called, consists
in the fusion of two distinct masses of protoplasm which are nearly always produced
by different individuals. In the case of hermaphrodites, the term applied to
organisms which produce both male and female gametes in the same individual,
there is generally some arrangement which tends to prevent the male gamete from
conjugating with the female gamete of the same parent ; but this phenomenon is

not absolutely excluded, and takes place as a normal phenomenon in many plants

and possibly in some animals.
     This fusion of the protoplasm of the two gametes gives us a iininucleated

--organism-- for the fusion of the nuclei of the two gametes seems to be an essential

part of the process in which the potencies of the two gametes are blended. The
zygote, as the mass formed of the fused gametes is called, is formed by the com-
bination of two individualities, and is therefore essentially a new individuality, the
characters of which will be different from the characters of both of the parents.
This fact, which is not apparent in the zygote when first established, because the
parts are hardly distinguishable by our senses, becomes obvious as soon as organs,
with the appearance of which we are familiar, are formed. As a general rule this
cannot be said to have occurred until wliat we call maturity has been nearly
reached, because we are not familiar enough with the features of immature organ-
isms to detect individual differences. But you may rest assured that sucii differ-
ences exist at all stages of growth from that of the uninucleated zygote till death.

How the characters of the two parents will combine in the zygote it is impossible

to predict, and the result is never the same even though the conjugations have

been between gametes of identical origin. There may be an almost perfect

mixture, the blending extending to even quite minute details ; or the characters

-- --of the one parent may predominate be prepotent, as we call it over those of

the other ; or they may blend in such a way that the zygote offers characters found
in neither parent. Or, finally, the features of one parent may come out at one

stage of growth, those of the other at another stage. But, however the characters

may blend, the product never exactly resembles the parents. The extent to which

it differs from them is the measure of the variation.
     To resume, it will be observed that in the metliod of reproduction someti&es

called sexual, two distinct processes occur. One of these is the real reproductive
act, which consists in the production by fission of uninuclear individuals called
gametes ; the second is the fusion of the gametes to form the zygote. The gametes
are of two kinds, and the reason of there being two kinds is intelligible when we
consider the parts they have to play. The male gamete is nearly always endowed
with locomotive power, and the female gamete is stored with food material to be
used by the zygote in the first stages of growth. The destiny of these two iminu-
cleated organisms is to fuse with one another, and so to give rise to a zygote
which ultimately assumes the typical form of the species. As a general rule the
gametes have but a limited duration ^ of life unless they conjugate, and this is
quite intelligible when we remember that they have no organs, e.(j. digestive

organs, suitable for the maintenance of life. It is rarely found that they have the
power of assuming the form of their parent, unless they conjugate. This never
happens in the case of the male gamete (at any rate in animals), and only rarely

--in that of the female. "When it occurs that is to say, when the ovum develops
--without conjugation we call the phenomenon parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis

is found more commonly in Arthropods than in other groups, but it may be more
common than is supposed.''

     ' Under favourable conditions they may live a considerable Wm^--e.g. the sper-

matozoon of certain ants, which are stated by Sir John Lubbock to live in some cases

for seven years.

     - It may be mentioned as a curious fact that parthenogenesis is rarely found in
the higher plants, and, as I have said, is not known for the male gamete among

animals.
762 liEPORT-- 1899.

     In sexual reproduction then, in addition to the real reproductive act, which is
the division by fission of the parent into two unequal parts, the one of which con-

tinues to be called the parent, while the other is the gamete, there is the subsequent

conjugation process. It is to this conjugation process that that important con-

Wecomitant of sexual reproduction must be attributed, namely genetic variation.
Wehave thus traced genetic variation to its lair.
                                                   have seen that it is due to the

Weformation of a new individuality by the fusion of two distinct individualities.

have also seen that in the higher animals it is always associated with the repro-

ductive act.

Let us now take a wider survey and endeavour to ascertain whether this most

important process, a process upon which depends the improvement as well as

the degradation of races, ever takes place independently of the reproductive act.

In the Metazoa, to which for our present purpose I allude under the term higher

animals, conjugation never takes place except in connection with reproduction. It is

impossible from the nature of the process that it should do so, as I hope to explain

later on. But among the Protozoa, the simplest of all animals, it is conceivable

that conjugation might take place apart from reproduction, and as a matter of

fact it does do so. Let us now examine a case in which this occurs. Amongst

the free-swimming ciliated Infusoria it frequently happens that two individuals

become applied together, and that the protoplasm of their bodies becomes con-

tinuous. They remain in this condition of fusion for some days, retaining how-

ever their external form and not undergoing complete fusion. While the continuity

lasts there is an exchange of living substance between the two bodies, in which

exchange a bit of the nucleus of each participates. It thus happens that at the

end of conjugation, when the two animals separate, they are both different from

what they were at the commencement ; each has received protoplasm and a

nucleus from its fellow, and the introduced nucleus fuses, as we know, with the

nucleus which has not moved. It would therefore appear that all the essential

features of the conjugation process, as we learnt them in the case of the conjuga-

tion of the gametes in the Metazoa, are present, and it is impossible to doubt that

we have here an essentially similar phenomenon. The phenomenon differs, how-

ever, from the conjugation first described in this interesting and important respect,

that the two animals separate and resume their ordinary life. It is true that

their constitution must have been profoundly changed, but they retain their general

form. I say that the constitution of the exconjugates, as we may call them after

they are separated, must be different from what it was before conjugation, but so far
as I know no diflerence in structure corresponding with this difference in con-

stitution has been recorded. I feel no sort of doubt, however, that structural

differences, i.e. variations, will be detected when the exconjugates are closely-

scrutinised and compared with the animals before conjugation, and I would suggest

that definite observations be made with a view to testing the point. Here then
we have a case of conjugation entirely dissociated from reproduction. Other cases

of a similar character are known among the Protozoa, though as a general rule the

fusion between the conjugating organisms is complete and permanent. Among

plants conjugation is generally associated with reproduction, but not always, for in

certain fungi ^ fusion of hyph^ and consequent intermingling of protoplasm occurs,

and is not followed by any form of reproduction. Among bacteria alone, so far as

I know, has the phenomenon of conjugation never been observed.

    To sum lip, we have seen that the phenomenon of conjugation is very widely

distributed. Excluding the bacteria, there is reason to believe that it forms a

part of the vital phenomena of all organisms. Its essential features are a mixture

and fusion of the protoplasm of two different organisms, accompanied by a fusion

of their nuclei. It results in the formation of a new individuality, which difiers

from the individuahties of both the conjugating organisms. This diflPerence

manifests itself in diS'erences in habit, constitution, form, and structure ; such

diflerences constituting what we have called genetic variations.

     ' It must be mentioned, however, that in the case of these fungi the fusion of
nuclei has not been observed, nor has it been noticed whether the habit, structure,
or constitution of the conjugating plants is altered after the fusion.
TRAXSACTIONS Of SECTION C.                   763

     The conjugation of the ovum and spermatozoon in the higher animals, and

the correspoading process in the higher plants, are special cases of this conjuga-
tion, in which special conjugating individuals are produced, the ordinary indi-

viduals being physically incapable of the process. The phenomenon of sex, with
all its associated complications, which is so characteristic of the higher animals
and plants, is merely a device to ensure the coming together of the two gametes.
In the lower animals it is possible for the ordinary organism to conjugate ; con-
sequently the phenomenon does not form the precursor of developmental change,
and is in no way associated with reproduction. Indeed, in such cases it is often
the opposite of reproduction, inasmuch as it brings about a reduction in the
number of individuals, two separate individuals fusing to form one.

Acquired Characters.

We --now come to the consideration of the second kind of variations namely,

those which owe their origin to the direct action of external agencies upon the

particular organism which shows the variation ; or, as Darwin puts it, to the

definite action of external conditions These are the variations which I have
called acquired variations or acquired characters. This is not a good name for

them, but at the present moment, when I am about to submit them to a critical

examination, I do not know of any other which could be suitably applied. Later

on, when I sum up the various effects of the direct action of external agencies
upon the organism, I may be able to use a more suitable term.

    The main peculiarities of acquired variations are two in number : (a) they
make their appearance as soon as the organism is submitted to the changed con-

ditions ; (6) speaking generally they are more or less the same in all the individuals

of the species acted upon. As examples of this kind of variations, I may mention

the effect of the sun upon the skin of the white man; the Porto Santo rabbit, an

individual of which recovered the proper colour of its fur in four years under the

English climate ; ' the change of Artemia salina to Artemia milhausenii ; the
increase in size of muscles as the result of exercise ; and the development of any

special facility in the central nervous system. Among plants, variations of this

kind are very easily acquired, by altering the soil and climate to which the

individuals are submitted. So common are they, that it is quite possible that a

large number of species are really based upon characters of this kind ; characters

which are produced solely by the external conditions, and which frequently dis-

appear when the old conditions are reverted to.
    With regard to these variations, we want to ask the following question : Do

they ever last after the producing cause of them is removed, and are they trans-

mitted in reproduction ? In a great number of cases they either cease when the

cause which has produced them is removed, or if they last the life of the individual

they are not transmitted in reproduction. But is this always the case ? That is
the important question we now have to consider.

     But before doing so let us inquire what acquired characters really are. The

so-called adults of all animals have, as part of their birthright, a certain plasticity

in their capacity of reacting to external influences ; they all have a certain power
of acquiring bodily and mental characters imder the influence of appropriate

stimuli. This power varies in degree and in quality in different species. In

plants, for instance, it is mainly displayed in habit of growth, form of foliage, &c.;

in man in mental acquirements, and so on. But however it is displayed, it is

this property of organisms which permits of the acquisition of those modifications

of structure which have been so widely discussed as acquired characters. Now

this power, when closely considered, is in reality only a portion of that capacity

for development which all organisms possess, and with which they become

Aendowed at the act of conjugation.  newly formed zygote possesses a certain

number of hidden properties which are not able to manifest themselves unless it

is submitted to certain external stimuli. It is these stimuli which constitute the

external conditions of existence, and the properties of the organism which are

' Darwin, Variation, ed. 2, vol. i. p. 119.
764 REPORT-- 1899.

only displayed under their influence are what we call acquired characters. They

are acquired in response to the external stimuli.

     It would appear, then, that every feature which successively appears in an
organism in the march from the uninucleated zygote to death is an acquired
character. At first the stimuli which are necessary are quite simple, being little
more than appropriate heat and moisture; later on they become more complicated,
until finally, when the developmental period is over and the mature life begins,
the necessary conditions attain their greatest complexity, and their fulfilment
constitutes what we call in the higher animals education. Education is nothing
more than the response of the nearly mature organism to external stimuli, the

penultimate response of the zygote to external stimidi, the ultimate being those of

senile decay, which end in natural death. Acquired properties, it will be seen, are
really stages in the developmental history. They differ in the complexity of the
stimulus required to bring them out. For instance, the segmentation of the egg
requires little more than heat and moisture, the walking of the chick the stimulus
of light and sound and gravity, the evolutions of an acrobat the same in greater
complexity, and lastly the action of a statesman requires the stimulation of almost

every sense in the greatest complexity. Moreover, not only are there differences
in the complexity of the stimulus required, but also in the rapidity with which the

organism reacts to it. The chick undergoes its whole embryonic development

in three weeks, a man in nine months ; the chick develops its walking mechanism
in a few minutes, while a man requires twelve months or more to eflPect
the same end. Chickens are much cleverer than human beings in this respect.

There is the same kind of difference between them that there is between
the power of learning displaved by a Macaulay and that displayed by a stupid

child.

    An instinct is nothing more than an internal mechanism which is developed

with great rapidity in response to an appropriate stimulus. It is difficult for us

to understand instincts, because with us almost all developmental processes are
extremely slow and gradual. This particularly applies to the development of those

nervous mechanisms, the working of which we call reason.
     Within certain limits the external conditions may vary without harming the

organism, but such variations are generally accompanied by variations in the form

in which the properties of the zygote are displayed. If the variations of the
conditions are too great, their action upon the organism is injurious, and results in

abortions or death. And in no case can the external conditions call out properties

with which the zygote was not endowed at the act of conjugatiou.

It would thus appear that acquired characters are merely phases of develop-

ment                         they are the manifestations of  the  properties of  the  zygote, and  are called
                          ;

forth only under appropriate stimulation ; moreover, they are capable of varying

within certain limits, according to the nature of the stimulus, and it is to these

variations that the term ' acquired character ' has been ordinarily applied.

   A genetic character, on the other hand, is the possibility of acquiring a certain

--feature under the influence of a certain stimulus ; it is not the feature itself that
-- Nowis an acquired character but it is the possibility of producing the feature.

as the possibility of producing the feature can only be proved to exist by actually

producing it, the term ' genetic character ' is frequently applied to the feature

itself, which is, as we have seen, an acquired character. In consequence of this
fact, that we can only determine genetic characters by examining acquired
characters, a certain amount of confusion may easily arise, and has indeed often

arisen, in dealing with this subject. This can be avoided by remembering that

in describing genetic characters account must always be taken of the conditions.

For example, the white fur of the Arctic hare is an acquired character, acquired in
response to a certain stimulus ; while the power of so responding to the particular

stimulus when applied at the correct time is a genetic character. Thus a genetic

character is a character which depends upon the nature of the organism, while an

acquired character depends on the nature of the stimulus.

    If we imagine a zygote to be a machine capable of working out certain results on
material supplied to it, then we should properly apply the term 'genetic character'
                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                    7G5

to the features of the machinery itself, and the words ' acquired character ' to the
results achieved by its working-. These clearly will depend primarily on the
structure of the machinery, and secondarily upon the material and energy supplied

--to it that is to say, upon the way in which it is worked.

     Variations in genetic characters are variations in the machinery of different

--zygotes that is to say, in the constitution-- while variations in acquired characters

are variations in the results of the working of one zygote according to the

conditions under which it is worked.
     For instance, let us take the case of those twins which arise by the division of

one zygote, and are consequently identical in genetic characters, z.e. in constitution.
If they are submitted to different conditions, they will develop differences which

will depend entirely upon the conditions and the time of life when the differen-

tiation in the conditions occurred. These difierences then will be a function of the
external conditions, i.e. of the manner in which the machinery is worked, and

constitute what we call variation in acquired characters.

Are Acquired Characters Transmissible as such i7i Reproduction ?

To return to our question, are the so-called acquired characters ever trans-

mitted in reproduction ? Let us consider what this question means in the light of

the preceding discussion. Acquired characters are features which arise in the

Nowzygote in response to external stimuli.  the zygote at its first establishment

has none of the characters which are subsequently acquired. All it has is the

power of acquiring them. Cleai-ly, then, acquired characters are not transmitted.

The power of producing them is all that can be transmitted ; and this power resides

in the reproductive organs and in the gametes to which the reproductive organs

give rise, so that the question must be put in another form. Is it possible by

submitting an organism to a certain set of conditions, and thus causing it to acquire

certain characters, so to modify its reproductive organs that the same characters

will appear in its offspring as the result of the application of a different and

simpler stimulus ?

For instance, the power of reading conferred by education, the hardness of the

hands and increased size of the muscles produced by manual labour : is it possible

that these characters, now produced by complex external stimuli applied at a

particular period of life, should ever in future ages be produced by the simpler

stimuli found within the uterus, so that a man may be born able to read or write,

or with hands horny and hard like those of a navvy ?

In trying to find an answer to this question let us first of all look into the

probabilities of the case, to see if we can relate the question to any other class of

phenomena about which we have, or think we have, definite knowledge.
    When an organism is affected by external agents the action may apply to the

whole organisation or principally to one organ. Let us take a case in which one

organ only appears to be affected, e.g. the enlargement by exercise of the right arm
of a man. Now, although in this case it is only the muscles of the arm which
appear at first sight to be affected, we must not forget that the organs of the body

are correlated with one another, and an alteration of one will produce an altera-

tion in others. By exercise of the right arm the muscles of that arm are obviously

enlarged, but other changes not so obvious must also have taken place. The

bones to which the muscles are attached will be altered; the blood-vessels sup-

plying the muscles will be enlarged, and the nerves which act upon tlie muscles,

and probably the part of the central nervous system from which they proceed, will

also be altered. These are some of the more obvious correlated changes which

--will have occurred ; no doubt there will have been others indeed it is not perhaps

too much to say that all the organs of the body will have reacted to the enlarge-

--ment of the arm but the efi'ect on oi'gans not in functional correlation with the

muscles of the right arm will be imperceptible, and may be neglected. Thus the

colour of the hair, the length and character of the alimentary caual, size of the

leg muscles, the renal organs, &c., will not show appreciable alteration.

Above all, the other arm will nob be afi'ected, or if it is affected the alteration
--766 REPORT 1899.

will be so slight as not to be noticeable. Now, we know that homologous parts,

whether symmetrically homologous or serially so, are in some kind of close con-

nection. For instance, when one member of au homologous series varie.s, it is

commonly found that other members of the same series will also vary. Yet in

spite of this connection which exists between the right and left arms and between

the right arm and right leg, there is no similar alteration either in the left arm or
in the right leg. Now, if parts which from these facts we may suppose to be in
some connection are not affected, how can we expect the reproductive organs not

only to he modified, but also to be so modified that the germs which are about to

-- --be budded off from them will be so affected as to produce exactly the same

character in this case enlarged muscle, &c. without the application of the same

stimulus, viz. exercise ? Thus, while I freely admit that every alteration of an

organ in response to external agents will react through the whole organisation,

affecting each organ in functional correlation with the affected organ in a way

which will depend upon the function of the correlated organ, and possibly other

organs not in functional correlation in an indefinite way and to a slight extent,

yet I maintain that it is very hard to believe that it will have such a sharp and

precise effect upon every spermatozoon and ovum subsequently produced that not

merely will these products be altered generally in all their properties, but that one

-- --particular part of them and that part of them always the same will be so

altered that the organisms which develop from them will be able to present the

same modification on the application of a different stimulus.  It is inconceivable
                                                                                                                                            ;

unless, indeed, we suppose that the very molecules of the incipient organs in the

germ are more closely correlated with corresponding parts of the parent body

than are the homologous parts of the parent body with one another.

Now, to prove the existence of such a remarkable and intimate correlation

would surely require the very strongest and most conclusive evidence. Is there

any such strong evidence? I think I may fairly answer this question in the

neo-ative. The evidence which has been brought forward in favour of the so-

called inheritance of acquired characters is far from conclusive. That such

evidence * exists I do not deny, but it is all, or almost all, capable of receiving

other interpretations.

                 Effect of Changed Conditions upon the Repj'oductive Organs,

    On the other hand, all the certain evidence we have concerning what happens
when the reproductive organs are affected, either directly or by correlation, by a

--change of conditions and, as we have seen above, they must be affected if there
--is to be any change in the offspring tends to show that there is not any relation

between the effect produced on the parent and that appearing in the offspring.
     The only means of judging whether the reproductive organs are affected by

external conditions is by observing any change which may occur in their function.
Now, only two such physiological effects of a change of conditions are certainly
known; these are (1) the production of sterility or of partial sterility; (2) the
production of an increased but indefinite variability in the offspring. With
regard to the first of these effects : One of the most common, or at any rate one

of the most noticeable alterations in an organism, effected by change in the
external conditions, is an alteration of the reproductive system, an alteration of
such a kind that organisms which had previously freely interbred with one
another are no longer able to do so. One of the most common results of removing
organisms from their natural surroundings is to induce sterility or partial sterility.
There is no reason to doubt that this sterility or tendency to sterility is, broadly
speaking, due to an affection of the reproductive system. In the case of the

higher animals, it may in some cases be due to an action upon the instincts, but
in the lower animals and in plants we can hardly doubt that it is due to a direct

action upon the reproductive organs. Indeed in plants these organs are often

visibly afl'ecte^- Among animals, however, there does not appear to be any satis-

Hcmaneb's Darmin and after Darnin, vol. ii. chaps. 3 and 4.

factory evidence on the point, and it is not known what organs are affected,

whether it is the actual gametes, or the reproductive glands, or some of the other

organs concerned.'

The other result of changed conditions which is certainly known is to induce an

increased amount of variability of the genetic kind, though not immediately, often

indeed not until after the lapse of some generations. On this point Darwin says :
' Universal experience shows us that when new flowers are first introduced into

our gardens they do not vary ; but ultimately all, with the rarest exceptions, vary

to a greater or less extent ' (' Variation,' ii. p. 249).'-^ With regard to the variability

thus induced, it is to be noticed that it is not confined to any particular organ,

nor does it show itself in any particular way. On the contrary, the whole organi-

sation is affected, and the variations are quite indefinite.

To sum up the argument as it at present stands : (1) a change in conditions cannot

affect the next generation unless the reproductive organs are affected ; (2) from a con-
sideration of the facts of the case, it is almost inconceivable that the effect produced

upon any organ of a given organism by a change of conditions should so modify the

reproductive organs of that organism as to lead to a corresponding modification in

the offspring without the latter being exposed to the same conditions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (3) the only

effects, which are certainly known, of changed conditions upon the reproductive

organs are («) the production of sterility ; (b) an increase in genetic variability.

    As far then as our certain knowledge goes, it would appear that a change of
conditions may have one or both of the following effects :

   A(1) definite change, of the same character or nearly so, in all the individuals

acted upon. Such changes may be adaptive or non-adaptive, but they are not

fiermanent, lasting only so long as the change of conditions, or at most during the
 ife of the individual acted upon. They are not transmitted in reproduction, and
do not appear in the offspring unless it is submitted to the same conditions. These

variations are the direct result of the action of the environment upon the indivi-
dual, with the exception of the reproductive organs.

      (2) Increase in the variations of the genetic kind. These are seen not in the
generation ^ first submitted to the changed condition, but in the next or some
subsequent generations. The effect is produced through the reproductive organs.
These variations are non-adaptive, and different in each individual.

    If the reproductive organs are affected we get an increase in the variations of
the genetic kind. These, we have seen, are usually of an indefinite character ; they

are different in every case, and their nature cannot be predicted from experi-

ence. But we still have to ask : Is this a universal rule ? Does it never happen

that a change of conditions so affects the reproductive organs as to produce a defi-
nite non-adaptive change of the same character or nearly so in all the descendants
of the individual acted upon ? This is the most obscure question connected with
the study of variations. If such changes occur, they might be cumulative, being
increased in amount by the continued action of the conditions. They would be
non-adaptive, their nature depending on the constitution of the reproductive cells
and having no functional relation to the original stimulus.

    As possible examples of such variation, I may recall those variations referred
to by Darwin as ' fluctuating variations which sooner or later become constant

     ' The exact cause of this sterility in the higher animals is a point which specially

needs investigation.

     - The phenomenon of increased variability following upon change of conditions
has most often been observed when the change has been from a state of nature to a
state of cultivation. Hence the conclusion has been drawn that the kind of change
involved in domestication alone induces variation. But there is no evidence in
favour of this view. The evidence shows that change of conditions in itself may

induce greater variability.

    3 No doubt the individuals of the generation first submitted to the changed condi-

tions would be affected as regards their reproductive organs, which would be altered
in structure, but this has not been made out, though there are indications of such an
effect in certain plants, vide Appendix.

Tariations which Darwin had in his miud when he wrote the following sentence

(' Origin,' p. 72) : ' There can be little doubt that the tendency to vary in the same

manner has often been so strong that all the individuals of the same species have

been similarly modided without the aid of selection.'

It is, however, as 1 have said, extremely doubtful if variations of this kind

really occur. The appearance of theui may be caused by the combination of the

two other kinds of variation. In all cases which might be cited in support of their

occurrence, there are the following doubtful elements : (1) no clear statement as

to whether the variations showed themselves  in  the   individuals  first  acted upon
                                                                                                                         ;

(2) no history of the organisms when transported back to the old conditions.

Moreover, a general consideration of the facts of the case renders it improbable

that such similar and definite genetic variations should ol'ten occur, at any rate

in sexual reproduction. For although the efiect upon the reproductive organs

may possibly be almost the same in nearly all the individuals acted upon, it

must not be forgotten that the reproductive elements have to combine in the act

of conjugation, and that it is the essence of this act to produce products which

differ in every case.

                    JEffect of Changed Conditions in Asexual B.eproduction.

     This brings us to the consideration of the question reserved on p. o: Are

genetic variations ever found in asexual reproduction ?
     If the views expressed in the earlier part of this Address are correct, it would

seem to follow that genetic variations are variations in the actual constitution, and
are inseparably connected with the act of conjugation. The act of conjugation
gives us a new constitution, a new individuality, and it is the characters of this
new individual in so far as they differ from the characters of the parents which

constitute what we have called genetic variations. According to this the answer

to our question would be that genetic variations cannot occur in asexual repro-
duction, and that if any indefinite variability recalling genetic variability makes
its appearance ' it must be part of the genetic variability and directly traceable
to the zygote from which the asexual generations started.

     But if genetic variability is not found in asexual reproduction the question still

--remains, can the other kind of variations namely, those due to the direct action of
-- Nowexternal forces upon the organism be transmitted in asexual reproduction ?

we have already seen that the effect of external agencies acting upon the organism

must be regarded under two heads, according as to whether the reproductive
organs are or are not affected. If the reproductive organs are not affected, then
variations caused by the impact of external forces will not be transmitted ; if, on

Wethe other hand, they are affected, the next generation will show the effect.

have further seen that in the case of sexual reproduction a modification of the

    ' Weismann, On Heredity, vol. ii. English edition, p. 161. Warren, E. ' Observa-

tion on Heredity in Parthenogenesis,' Proc. Ruy. Soc. 65, 1899, p. 154. These are the

only observations I know of on this subject. They tend to show the presence of a

slight variability, but they are not entirely satisfactory. In connection with this

matter I may refer to Weismann's view that Cypris reptans, the species upon which

his observations were made, reproduces entirely by parthenogenesis, and has lost the

power of sexual reproduction. This view is based on the fact that he has bred forty
consecutive parthenogenetic generations and has never seen a male. As Weismann

bases some important conclusions on tliis view, with regard to the importance of

conjugation in rej uvenescence of organisms, I may point out that the fact that he has

bred forty successive generations and has never seen a male cannot be regarded as

conclusive evidence that males never appear. We know of many cases in which

reproduction can continue for more than fortj^ generations without the intervention
of conjugation, e.g. ciliated infusoria, many plants, and of other species of Crustacea

in which the male is vety rare and only appears after long intervals.

I'epl'oductive organs will, because of the intervention of conjugation, appear as an

increase in genetic variability only. IIow will the matter stand iu the case of
asexual reproduction ? First, with regard to modifications which do not affect the

--reproductive system they, as in sexual reproduction, will not he transmitted.

--Secondly, as regards modifications which do affect the reproductive organs they

will be transmitted, i.e. they will affect the ne.xt generation ; and the question

arises, how will they be transmitted ? For here we have the opportunity wanting

in the case of sexual reproduction of studying the transmission of modifications

of the reproductive system without the complications iutroduced by the act of

conjugation.

In considering this matter, it must be remembered that the reproductive

organs are with regard to external intluences exactly as any other organ. They

can be modified either directly or indirectly, though the}' are iu animals often less

liable to direct modification by reason of their internal position.' These modifica-

tions may, as in the case of other organs, be obvious to the eye of the observer, or

they may be so slight as only to be detected by an alteration of function. Now,

in the case of the reproductive organs this alteration of function will show itself

in the individuals of the next generation (if not before) which proceed directly and

without any complication from the affected tissue. Flow will these individuals be

affected ? Will they all be affected in the same kind of way, or will they be affected

in different ways ? Finally, will the modification last their lives only, or will it

continue into subsequent asexually produced generations ?

     Let us endeavour to answer these questions :

    How(1) will the offspring be affected? That will depend entirely upon how

the reproductive organ was affected. Will the modification in the offspring have

any adaptive relation whatever to the external cause ? Now here we have a

capital opportunity, an opportunity not afforded at all by sexual reproduction, of

examining by experiment and observation the Lamarckian position. My own

opinion is that there will be no relation of an adaptive kind between the external

cause and the modification of the offspring. For instance, let us imagine, as an

experiment, that a number of parthenogenetically reproducing organisms are sub-

mitted to a temperature lower than that at which they are accustomed to live.

Let us suppose that the cold affects their reproductive organs and produces a modi-

fication of the offspring. Will the modification be in the direction of enabling

Mythe offspring to flourish in a lower temperature than the parent ?  own opinion,

as I have said, is that there will probably be no such tendency in the offspring, if

all possibility of selection be excluded Bat that is only an opinion. The question

is unsettled, and must remain unsettled until it is tested upon asexually reproduc-.

ing organisms.

    (2) Will they all be affected in the s une kind of way ? Yes, presumably they

will. I arrive at this conclusion, not by experiment, but by reasoning from aunlogy.

In the case of other organs of the body, the same external cause produces in all

individuals acted upon, roughly speaking, the same kind of effect, e.y. action of
sun upon skin, effect of transplanting maize, Porto Santo rabbits, &c. The

question, however, cannot be settled in this waj. It requires an experimental

answer.

(.3) Will the modification last beyond the life of the individuals produced by

Wethe affected reproductive organ ? I can give no answer to this question.

Wehave no data upon which to form a judgment.  cannot say whether it is possible

permanently to modify the constitution of an organism in this way, or whether,

however strong the cause may be, consistently of course with the non-destruction

--of life, the effects will gradually die away it may be in one, it may be in two or

more generations. There are cases known which might assist in settling these

questions, but I must leave to another opportunity the task of examining them.

I refer to such cases as Artemia i-alina, various cases of bud variation which

cannot be included under the head of growth variation.

                 Senile Decay and Rejuvenescence of Organisms.

Another question, also of the utmost importance, confronts U3 at this point.

As is well known, organisms are liahle to wear and tear, sooner or later some part

or parts essential to the maintenance of the vital functions wear out and are not

renewed by the reparative processes which are supposed to be continually taking
place in the organism. This constitutes what we call senile decay, and leads to the

death of the organism. As a good example of the kind of cause of senile decay,
we may mention the wearing out of the teeth, which in mammals at any rate are

not replaced ; the wearing out of the elastic tissue of the arterial wall, which is

probably not replaced. There is no reason to suppose that the reparative process

of any organism is sufSciently complete to prevent senile decay. There is probably

always some part or parts which cannot be renewed, even in the simplest organisms.

Maupas has shown that this holds for the ciliated Infusoria, and he has also shown

how the renewal of life, which of course must be eflected if the species is to con-
tinue, is brought about. He has shown that it is brought about by conjugation,

during which process the organism may be said to be put into the melting-pot and

reconstituted. For instance, many of the parts of the conjugating individuals are

renewed, including the whole nuclear apparatus, which there is every reason to

believe is of the greatest importance to living matter.

On reconsidering the life of the Metazoa in light of the facts established by

Maupas for the Infusoria, we see that all Metazoa are in a continual state of

fission, as are the ciliated Infusoria. They are continually dividing into two
unequal parts, one of which we call the parent and the other the gamete. The

parent Metazoon  must   eventually die                                                                    it cannot be put  into  the  melting-pot ;  its
                                                                                                       ;

parts cannot be completely renovated. The gamete can be put into the melting-

pot of conjugation, and give rise to an entirely reconstituted organism, with all the

parts and organs brand-new and able to last for a certain time, which is the

length of life of the individual of the species.

    Is there any other way than that of conjugation by which an organism can

acquire a complete renewal of its organs ? Is the renewal furnished by the
development of all the parts afresh which takes place in a parthenogenetic ovum

such a complete renewal ? This question cannot now be certainly answered, but
the balance of evidence is in favour of a negative answer. And this view of the

matter is borne out by a consideration of the facts of the case. In all cases of

conjugation which have been thoroughly investigated, the nuclear apparatus is

completely renewed. It would appear indeed as though the real explanation of

the uninuclear character of the Metazoon gamete is to be sought in the necessity

Nowof getting the nuclear apparatus into the simplest possible form for renewal.

in the development of a parthenogenetic ovum the ordinary process of renewal
of the nucleus is often in partial abeyance. As a rule it only divides once instead

of twice, and there is, of course, no reinforcement by nuclear fusion. It is, of course,

possible that the reinforcement by nuclear fusion which occurs in conjugation may

have a different explanation from the nuclear reconstitution which takes place in

the formation of polar bodies and similar structures. On the other hand, it may
Weall be part of the same process.
                                                                                                          cannot tell. So that we are unable to

answer the question whether for complete rejuvenescence a new formation of all

parts of the organism is sufficient, or whether a reconstitution of the nuclear

apparatus of the kind which takes place in the maturation of the Metazoon

ovum and the division of the micro-nucleus of Paramecium is also required ; or

finally, whether in addition to the latter phenomenon a reinforcement and

reconstitution by fusing with another nucleus is also necessary for that complete

rejuvenescence which enables an organism to begin the life cycle again and to pass

through it completely.

"With regard to buds in plants there is reason to believe that they share in the

growing old of the parent. That is to say, if we suppose the average life of the

individual to be 100 years, a bud removed at 60 will be 50 years of age, and

only be able to live on the graft for 50 more years.

                                    Heredity,

    Having now spokeu at some length of the phenomenon of variation, I must
Eroceed to consider from the same general point of view the phenomenon oi

  eredity.

     As we have seen, in asexual reproduction heredity nppears, as a general rulp,
if not always, to be complete. The otlspring do not merely present resemblances
to the parent-- they are identical with it. And this foot does not appear to be
astonishing when we consider the real nature of the process. Asexual reproduc-

tion consists in the separation off of a portion of the parent, which, like the parent,
is endowed with the power of growth. In virtue of this property it will assume,
if it does not already possess it, and if the conditions are approximately similar,

the exact form of the parent. It is a portion of the parent ; it is endowed with
the same property of growth; the wonder would be if it assumed any other

form than that of the parent. Indeed, it is doubtful if the word ' heredity ' would
ever have been invented if the only form of increase of organisms was the asexual
one, because, there being no variation to contrast with it, it would not have struck
us as a quality needing a name, any more than we have a name for that property
of the number two which causes it to make four when duplicated.

     The need for the word ' heredity' only becomes apparent when we consider that

other form of reproduction in which the real act of reproduction is associated with

the act of conjugation. Looking at reproduction from a broad point of view, we
may sum up the ditl'erence between the two kinds, the sexual and the asexual, by
saying that whereas the essence of sexual reproduction is the formation of a new

individuality, asexual reproduction merely consists in increasing the number of one
kind of individual. From this point of view sexual reproduction is better termed
the creation of a new individuality, for that, and not the increase in the number
of individuals, is its real result. Inasmuch as conjugation of two organisms is the
essential feature of sexual reproduction, it would appear that tlie number of
individuals would be actually diminished as a result of it ; and this does reallv
happen, though in a masked manner, lor we are not in the habit of looking upon
the spermatozoon and ovum as individuals, though it is absurd not to do so, as they

contain latent all the properties of the species, and are sometimes able to manliest

these properties (parthenogenetic ova) without conjugating. In some of the lower
organisms the fact that conjugation does not result in an increase of the number of

individuals, but only in the production of a new individuality, is quite apparent,
for in them two of the ordinary individuals of the species fuse to form one (many

Protozoa).

     So that sexual reproduction gives us a new individuality which can spread to

almost any extent by asexual reproduction. This asexual reproduction gives us a
group of organisms which is quite diflerent from a group of organisms produced by

sexual reproduction. Whereas the latter groups constitute what we call species,

the former group has, so far as I know, no special name, unless it be variety but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

variety is not a satisfactory name, for it has been used in another sense by

systematisers.

Heredity, then, is really applicable only to the appearance in a zygote of some

Aof the properties of the gametes.  zygote has this property of one of the prece-

dent gametes, and that property of the other, in virtue of the operation of what we

call heredity ; it has a third property possessed by neither of the precedent gametes

in virtue of the action of variation, the nature of which we have already examined.

It is impossible to say which ])roperty of a gamete will be inherited, and it is
impossible to predict what odd property will result from the combination of the

properties of the two gametes. Of one thing only are we certain, that they are

never the same in zygotes formed by gametes produced in immediate succession
from the same parent.

    We may thus regard the activities of the zygote as the resultant of the dashing

together of the activities of the gametes.

Conjugation, then, is a process of the utmost importance in Biology ; it pro-

                                                                            3d3

vides the mecbanlsin by which organisms are ahle to vary, independently 0/ tnd
conditions in which they live. It lies, therefore, at the very root of the evolution
problem ; the power of combining to form a zygote is one of the fundamental

properties of living matter.

                                                                           Species.

    Now let us consider one of the effects of this property upon organisms. The

effect to which I refer is the division of animals into groups called species. Species
are groups of organisms, the gametes of which are able to conjugate and produce

normal zygotes. Now in Nature there appear to be many causes which prevent

gametes from conjugating. First and most important of all is some physical
incompatibility of the living matter which prevents that harmonious blending of
the two gametes which is essential for the formation of a normal zygote. Very
little is known as to the real nature of this incompatibility ; in fact it is hardly an

exaggeration to say that nothing is known. It may be that there is actual
repulsion between the gametes, or it may be in some cases, at least, that the

gametes are able to fuse, but not to undergo that intimate blending which is
necessary for the production of a perfect zygote. In some cases we know that
something like this happens ; for instance, a blend can he obtained between the
horse and the ass, but it is not a perfect blend, the product or zygote being imper-

--fect in one most important particular namely, reproductive power.
  A --second cause which prevents conjugation is a purely mechanical one viz.

some obstacle which prevents the two gametes from coming together. As an
instance of this I may refer to those cases amongst plants in which conjugation is

impossible, because the pollen tube is not long enough to reach the ovule. In yet
other cases conjugation is impossible because the organisms are isolated from one
another either geographically or in consequence of their habits. There are probably

many causes which prevent conjugation, but, whatever they m.ay be, the effect of

them is to break up organisms into specific groups, the gametes of which do

normally conjugate with one another.

     In many cases, no doubt, the 2:ametes of organisms which are kept apart in
Nature by mechanical barriers will conjugate fully if brought together. But in
the great "maiority of cases it is probable no amount of proximity will bring about

complete conjugation. There is physical incompatibility. Here is a fruitful
opening for investigation. Observations are urgently needed as to the real nature

of this iucompatibility.

      Importance of the Stuihj of Variation.

Another and most important effect of conjugation is, as we have seen, the much-

spoken-of constitutional or genetic variations. They are,as we have already insisted,

of the utmost importance to the evolutionist. Evolution would have been impos-

sible without them, for it is made up of their summation. It becomes therefore desi-

rable to find out to what extent a species is capable of varying. This can only be

done, as Mr. Bateson has pointed out, by recording all variations found. Mr. Bate-

son, in his work already referred to, has carried this out, and has shown the way

to a collection of these most important data. In order to carry it further, I would

sugo-est that the collection be made not only for structure, but also for function.

This has been done largely for the nervous functions by psychologists and natural-

ists who pay special attention to the  instincts of  animals                                         but we want a similar
                                                                                                  ;

collection for other functions. For instance, the variations in the phenomena of

heat and menstruation, and of rut amongst mammals, and so on. To do this is

really only to apply the methods of comparative anatomy and comparative

physiology to the members of a species, as they have already been applied tothe

different species and larger groups of the animal kingdom. Such investigations

cannot fliil to be of the greatest interest. Indeed, when we have learnt the normal

habits and structure of a species, what more interesting study can there be than

the study of the possibilities of variation contained within it ? Then when we
know the limits of variability of any given specific group, we proceed to try if wq
                    --

                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                             773

can by selective breeding or alteration of the conditions of life alter the variability,
and perhaps call into existence a kind of variation quite different in character from
that previously obtained as characteristic of the species.

                     The Euolution of Heredity and the Origin of Variation.

    These remarks bring me to the consideration of a point to -which I am anxious to
call your attention, and which is an important aspect of our subject. Has the
variability of organisms ever been different from what it is now ? Has or has not

evolution had its influence upon the property of organisms as it is supposed to have
had upon their other properties ? There is only one possible answer to this
question. Undoubtedly the variability of orgacisms must have altered with the
progress of evolution. It would be absurd to suppose that organisms have
remained constant in this respect while they have undergone alteration in all their
other properties. If the variability of organisms has altered, it becomes necessary
to inquire in what direction has it altered? Has the alteration been one of
diminution, or has it been one of increase ? Of course, it is possible that there has
been no general alteration in extent with the course of evolution, and that the
alteration, on the whole, has been one of quality only. But passing over this
third possibility, let us consider for the moment which of the two tirst named

alternatives is likely to have occurred.
     According to the Darwinian theory of evolution, one of the most important

factors in determining the modification of organisms has been natural selection.
Selection acts by preserving certain favourable variations, and allowing others less

favourable to be killed off in the struggle for existence. It thus will come about
that certain variations will be gradually eliminated. Meanwhile the variations of
the selected organisms will themstlves be submitted to selection, and certain of
these will be in their turn eliminated. In this way a group of organisms becomes
more and more closely adapted to its surroundings ; and unless new variations
make their appearance as the old unfavourable ones are eliminated, the variability
of the species will dimiuisli as the result of selection. Is it likely that new
variations will appear in the manner suggested ? To answer this question we
must turn to the results obtained by human agency in the selective breeding of
animals. The experience of breeders is that continued selection tends to produce
a greater and greater purity of stock, characterised by small variability, so that if
the selective breeding is carried too far, variation almost entirely ceases, and there

is little opportunity left for the exercise of the breeder's art. "VN'hen this condition
has been arrived at, he is obliged, if he wants to produce any further modifications

of his animals, to introduce new blood i.e. to bring in an individual which baa

either been bred to a different standard, or one in which the variability has not

been so completely extinguished.

    It would thus appear, and I think we are justified in holding this view, at any

rate provisionally, that the result of continued selection will be to diminish the
variability of a species ; and if carried far enough, to produce a race with so little
variability, and so closely adapted to its surroundings, that the slightest alteration

in the conditions of life will cause extinction.^

     If selection tends to diminish the variability of a species, then it clearly follows
that as selection has been by hypothesis the most important means of modifying

organisms, variation must have been much greater in past times than it is now.

' The expression 'extinction of species' seems to be used in two senses, which are

generally confused. Firstly, a species may become modified so that the form with

which we are familiar gradually gives place to one or more forms which have been

gradually produced by its modification. That is to say, a character or series of

characters becomes gradually modified or lost in successive generations. This is not

really extinction, but development. Secondly, a species may gradually lose its

variability, and become fixed in character. If the conditions then change, it is

unable to adapt itself to them, and becomes truly extinct. In this case it leaves nq

Weflp^gei)cla,nts,  haye tp dP with dec|,t|i, and i^oif with development,
--774 EEPORT 1899.

In fact it must have been progressively greater the farther we go back from the

present time.

     The argument which I have just laid before you points, if carried to its logical

-- --conclusion and I see no reason wliy it should not be so carried to the view that

at the first origin of life upon the earth the variability of living matter consequent
upon the act of conjugation must have been of enormous range : in other words, it

points to the view that heredity was a much less important phenomenon than it is
at present. Following out the same train of thought, we are inevitably driven to

the conclusion that one of the most important results of the evolutionary change
has been the gradual increase and perfection of heredity as a function of organisms
and a gradual elimination of variability.

     Tliis view, if it can be established, is of the utmost importance to our theoretical

conception of evolution, because it enables us to bring our requirements as to time

within the limits granted by the physicists. If variation was markedly greater in
the early periodw of the. existence of living matter, it is clear that it would have
been possible for evolutionary change to have been effected much more rapidly than

--at present especially when we remember that the world was then comparatively

unoccupied by organisms, and that with the change of conditions consequent on

the cooling and differentiation of the earth's surface, new places suitable for

organic life were continually being formed. It will be observed that the conclusion

we have now reached, viz. that variation was much greater near the dawn of life

than it is now, and heredity a correspondingly less important phenomenon, is a
deduction from the selection theory. It becomes, therefore, of some interest to
inquire whether a sug-gpstion obtained by a perfectly legitimate mode of reasoning
receives any independent confirmation from other sources. The first source of

facts to which we turn for such confirmation must obviously be palaeontology.
But pala3ontology unfortunately affords us no help. The facts of this science are

too meagre to be of any use. Indeed, they are wanting altogether for the period

--which most immediately concerns us namely, the period when the existing forms

of life were established. This took place in the prefossiliferous period, for in the
earliest fossiliferous rocks examples of almost all existing groups of animals are
met with.

     But although palaeontology affords us no assistance, there is one class of facts
which, when closely scrutinised, does lend some countenance to the view that when
evolutionary change was at its greatest activit}', i.e. when the existing forms of
life were being established, variation was considerably greater than it is at the

present day.

     But as this address has already exceeded all reasonable limits, and as the
question which we are now approachintj is one of very great complexity and

difficulty, I am reluctantly compelled to defer the full consideration and treatment
of it to another occasion. I can only hope that the far-reaching importance of my
subject and the interest of it may to some extent atone for the great length which

this address has attained,

                                                                  APPENDIX.

     The following observations on the condition of the male reproductive organs in
highly variable plants are quoted from Darwin's ' Variation of Animals and Plants
under Domestication,' vol. ii. pp. 256 et seq.

In certain plant hybrids which are highly variable, it is known that the anthers

contain many irregular pollen-grains. Exactly the same fact has been noticed by

Max VVichura in many of our highly cultivated plants which are extremely

variable, and which there is no reason to believe have been hybridised, such as the

hyacinth, tulip, snapdragon, potato, cauliflower, &c.

     The same observer also 'finds in certain wild forms the same coincidence
between the state of the pollen and a high degree of variability, as in many

species  of  Eubus                                  but  in  Jt,  Q^sius  and  id(eus,  which are not highly variable

Aspecies, the pollen is sound.'  little further on Darwin says ' these facts indicate

that there is some relation between the state of the reproductive organs and a

tendency to variahility ; but we must not conclude that the relation is strict.'
Finally he sums up the matter in these words : * On the whole, it is probable that

any cause affectinf^ the organs of reproduction would likewise afl'ect their product

that is, the offspring thus generated.'

                             FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15.

     The following Papers were read :

1. Astrosclera Willeyana, the type of a new family of Recent Sponges.

    By J. J. Lister,!/.^., F.Z.S., Demonstrator of Com2^arative Anatomy

       in the University of Cambridge.

    In the collections brought home by Dr. Willey from the Western Pacific were
four specimens of a peculiar hard white organism which he found growing on dead

coral at a depth of 80 fathoms, in Sandal Bay, Lifu, Loyalty Islands. These he

has placed in my hands for examination. The specimens are cylindrical in shape,
and measure about 10 mm. in height and 5 mm. in breadth. The base is slightly

spreading, and the upper surface gently convex.

   --Skeleton. The skeleton is formed of solid polyhedral elements, which are

composed of crystalline fibres radiating from a central point. They are united
into a mass so rigid that to obtain sections of it slices were cut with a fret-saw,
and, after embedding in copal by von Koch's method, were ground down thin on a
hone. The mineral constituent of the skeleton is carbonate of lime in the form

--as the specific gravity shows of aragonite. The skeleton is permeated by canals

which open only on the upper surface. There is no large central space to which

the canals are tributary. Many are approximately parallel with the axis, and they

communicate very freely by branch canals, which run from one to another, dividing
and anastomising (see fig. on p. 776).

     The sides are smooth and imperforate, while the curved upper surface is closely
pitted by the openings of the canal system. In one specimen the upper surface is
traversed by grooves, which radiate, with an appi'oach to symmetry, from one

point. These are apparently radially directed canals of the skeleton in course of
formation. There is no indication that the central point is occupied by a canal
larger than the others, whose openings are scattered over the surface.

     The ridges of the skeleton between the openings are produced into irregular
crests and points formed of skeletal elements, which are more and more loosely
connected with one another as the surface is approached.

     The gelatinous layer which invests the upper surface is crowded with young
growing skeletal elements, the small ones free and spherical, the larger packed
together like hailstones, and assuming the polyhedral form.

   --Origin of the Skeletal Elemeids. The spherules take their origin in single

cells of the jelly, near the upper surface. In the early stages of growth the
granular nucleated cell body is seen as a thin investing layer surrounding the
spherule, which'is from the first composed of radiately arranged crystalline fibres.

As the spherule increases in size it takes up its position as an element of the

fixed skeleton, and in the course of their growth the angular .«paces between
adjacent skeletal elements are completely filled in to the exclusion of the .«oft
pai'ts. The elements thus lose their spherical shape and become polyhedral. The
external surface of a spherule in contact with a layer of soft tissue is often beset
with radiating points, and resembles a portion of a spheraster of a siliceous sponge.
After decalcification a more or less abundant organic basis of the skeleton is left;
the central parts of the spherules take a deeper stain, and are thus marked off from

the peripheral portions.
--776 REPORT 1899.

--The Soft Tissues. The gelatinous layer, above alluded to as investino- the

ridges of the skeleton, lines the openings of the canal system and extends as a
Asheet, thin in the centre, over the mouth of each canal.
                                                           round pore is frequently

present at this point, but in many cases the membrane is not perforated · the

spaces at the mouths of the canals are, however, in communication with one

another by lateral channels through the jelly, beneath the surface membrane.

Besides the cells in which the spherules are found, there are branched amoeboid

cells sparsely scattered through the jelly.

                                                                               CANALS

                                                                                           Section of soft tissue (highly magnified).

    The soft tissues of the sponge are contained in the skeletal canals (as they may
now be termed to distinguish them from the canals which run in the soft parts),

and penetrated by the water-bearing canals which open by the pores at the surface.
From the main canals small ones are given off which ramify in the layer of soft
tissue in contact with the skeleton.

    As the canals are followed downwards into the interior, the cellular elements
in their walls, at first scattered, become more and more abundant, and the jelly
legs conspicuous. At a short distauce from the surface the soft tissue assumes the
               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                    777

Acliaracters which are maintained throughout the interior of the sponge.     section

through it shows that it is largely made up of cells united into a reticulum with

vacuolar spaces of various sizes formiug the meshes. The jelly which is so con-

spicuous in the surface layers appears to be scanty or altogether absent here.

Besides the smaller branched protoplasmic masses with nuclei --1'5 2/i in diameter,

which make up the greater part of the reticulum, there are larger and more
circumscribed cells with larger nuclei --(2 3fx diam.) Scattered through the

reticulum, and with their walls apparently Ibrmed by portions of it, are the

ciliated chambers and the ramifying branches of the canal system.

   --Ciliated Chambers. These are round or oval chambers of minute but fairly

uniform size, the larger measuring 18 by 11/j, the smaller 10 by 8^. (The sections
of smaller diameter are doubtless in many cases transverse to the long axis of larger
chambers.) Their walls are formed by cells which send out processes laterally, and

these, joining witli one another, bound the chamber, others extending away from the

chamber are continuous with other cells of the reticulum, while a third set of

processes project into the cavity of the chamber, and eacb, tapering gradually from

its base, forms a flagellum which may extend across to the other side of the

chamber. There is no indication of a collar, or of the abrupt trimcated termination

of the cell body at the base of the flagellum, characters which are usually seen in

Achoanocytes.  well-marked nucleus is situated at the base of the flagellum at its

junction with the body of the cell. The flagella project from about half the

concave inner surface oi" the chamber, some four or five commonly appearing in

section, and their tips thus converge, and are often seen to have become entangled.

The remainder of the inner wall of the chamber is smooth. The cavity opens into

a branch of the canal system by a narrow passage about ifj. in diameter.

    Although the features of the ciliated chambers above described difl'er in many

points from those usually met with in sponges, they are so distinctly seen as to

give the impression that they are approximately those of the living tissue.

The larger branches of the canal system, with flattened nuclei scattered over

their walls, are easily recognised, but in many cases it is difficult to decide whether

a particular space met with in a section is to be referred to the canal system or to

a vacuolar mesh of the reticulum, if indeed the two are distinct.

In some of the skeletal canals the tissue above described is abundant, in others

only a thin lining of loose vacuolated tissue is found, but all intermediate con-

ditions in the character of the soft tissue lying between the skeleton and the main

trunks of the canal system are met with.

The existence of ciliated chambers implies the existence of afferent and

efferent channels. I have not been able to recognise, from the structure, a

differentiation of the canals into these two categories, but it seems clear that

the efferent system is not collected into one or a few large channels, such as

Myare commonly found in sponges.  impression is that there are a large number

not only of afferent but efferent trunks to the canal system, supplying and draining

approximately equal areas.

  --Reproductioyi. Each of the three specimens which I examined by sections

contained large eggs or embryos. They are found near the orifices of the largei

canals, separated from the skeletal wall by a thin layer of soft tissue. I have not

been able to recognise eggs in a young stage of growth. An advanced ovinn in
one specimen measures O'l mm. in length, and has a thick-walled nucleus 25^
in diameter, and a well-marked germinal spot. An embnjo in the same specimen

has a superficial layer of nuclei, and the protoplasm about them is disposed in

columns perpendicular to the surface. Internally the columns are merged in the

granular protoplasm which occupies the interior of the embryo, and this is

obscurely divided into irregular masses, but not, so far as I can detect, containing

nuclei. None of the embryos have a segmentation cavity. It appears, then, that

the development leads to the formation of a larva oi a. pnreyichjnnda type, rather

than an amphibla^tnla. I have not been able to recognise any stage in the

formation of sjjermatozoa.

skeletal canals in tlie basal region of the sponge, these being left empty, or with
only a thin layer of tissue on their walls.

   --Zoological Position. That the animal under consideration belongs to the

Porifera seems clear from the presence in the soft tissues of numerous chambers
provided with flagella and communicating with a system of canals which ulti-
mately open to the exterior by pores. The soft tissues are, moreover, supported
by a skeleton composed of elements which are secreted by cells of the jelly.

    On the other hand, that it is not a Cwlenterate is shown by the absence of

polyps, mesenteries, and thread-cells.

    But admitting that Astrosclera is a Sponge, there are many features which
separate it from the living members of this group. Among these may be men-

tioned :

     (a) The shape of the skeletal elements. They are polyhedra, which begin as

spheres, and may pass through a spheraster stage.

      (p) Then' union to form a rigid skeleton to the exclusion of the soft parts. In
Petrostroma of Doderlein the supporting skeleton is also formed of fused calcareous
spicules, but these are modified quadriradiates.

     (c) The mode of growth by the addition of new skeletal elements at the upper

surface, and without interstitial growth.
     {d) The limitation of the pores to the upper surface. Tentorium (Vosmaer),

a siliceous sponge classed with the Polymastidts, presents a similar limitation.
     (e) The absence of large gastral spaces.
     (f) The small size of the ciliated chambers. They do not exceed 18/j. by 11/x,

while the smallest size given by Hseckel for the Leucones (whose ciliated chambers

are smaller than those of other Calcarea) is GO/n by 40/i. Among the non-Calcarea

42/x is the smallest diameter given for the ciliated chambers.

     ($') The character of the cells bearing the flagella. They appear not to be
collar-cells of the usual type, but more or less amojboid, and without a collar, the
body of the cell gradually tapering into the flagellum.

    From the Calcarea it differs also in the following features :

     (fl) The flagellate cells are limited to about half the interior of the ciliated

chambers.
      {b) There appears to be a long and complicated canal system both on the

afferent and eflTerent sides of the ciliated chambers.
     (c) The mineral constituent of the skeleton is aragonite and not calcite.

While Astrosclera is very distinct from any of the families of living sponges,

its resemblance to certain members of the group of fossil .sponges Pharetrones is

very striking. These are found in strata ranging from the Devonian to the

Cretaceous periods.

The feature characteristic of many members of this group (though authorities

are by no means agreed either on its essential characters or limits) is that the

skeletal elements are united together into dense trabeculse or ' fibres,' as they are

technically called, between which a branched canal-work is often present, leading

into a central gastral cavity. The latter, however, may be so shallow as almost

Ato cease to exist.      cortical layer, which has been thought to be imperforate,

often clothes the outer surface of the cylindrical members of this group, and in that

case the pores leading to the interior would be limited to the upper part of the

sponge. In some cases radiating grooves are present on the upper surface con-

verging towards the mouth of the gastral cavity, the initial stage of the branched

canals of the interior.

If we suppose the trabeculfe of the skeleton of one of the simple forms to

increase in thickness, and the gastral cavity to become wholly obliterated (as is

very nearly the case in Stellispongiii), we have a form agreeing with Astrosclera

in the larger features of the anatomy of the skeleton.

    On turning our attention, however, to the elements of which the fibres of the

skeleton are formed, we find that in the Pharetrones in which the structure is most
                         TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.     779

perfectly preserved, they are well-marked tri- and quadriradiate spicules similar to

those of otlier calcareous sponges.^ They are closely packed together, the rays

heing heat to adapt them to one another to form the fibre of the sponge. The

spicules have been clearly demonstrated in several genera, including, besides simple

forms, the remarkable segmented sponges such as Verticillites, which consist of

tubular segments whose walls are formed of close-packed spicules, and which are

superposed one upon another, the roof of one forming the floor of its successor.

In the Triassic deposits of St. Cassian in the Tyrol, representatives of the

Pharetrones occur, in which the fibres of the skeleton are made up, not of spicules,

but of spheroidal masses, with a radiate structure strikingly resembling the ele-

ments of the skeleton of Astronc/erar

The view of this structure generally held by palaeontologists is that it is second-

ary, being due to a recrystallisation of the lime. If this is the case, it is certainly

a remarkable coincidence that the structure should resemble so closely that of a

living form, which in the larger features of the anatomy of its skeleton resembles

Amemhers of the Pharetrones.  fact which supports the view of the secondary

nature of the spherulitic structure is that the fossils in which it occurs are the repre-

sentatives in the St. Cassian beds of both simple (e.g. Corynella gracile, Miinstr.),

and segmented (e.g. E)wploca-lia and Thaumastocodia) forms of the Pharetrones,

which as they occur elsewhere exhibit as we have seen well-marked tri- and

quadriradiate spicules.

Supposing the spherulitic structure to be secondary in these fossils, the nature

of the skeletal elements is a definite character dividing Astrosclera from the

Phai-et rones.

Under these circumstances it seems better to class Astrosclera as the type of a

new family Astroscleridcs, possibly allied to the Pharetrones, but certainly without

close affinity with any other known group of sponges.^

2. On the Morphology of the Cartilages of the Monotreme Larynx. By

    Johnson Symington, M.D., Professor of Anatomy, Queen's College,

      Belfast.

     This paper contained a description of the cartilaginous framework of the larynx
of the ornithorhynchus and the echidna, based upon ordinary dissections and
complete serial microscopic sections of the organ.

     The condition of the thyroid cartilage in the monotremes is of special interest,
as it forms the basis of Dubois' theory of the origin of this cartilage from two
pairs of visceral arches, the fourth and fifth post-oral. The author referred to the
different descriptions of this cartilage given by Dubois, Wiedersheim, Walker,
and Gegenbaur, and showed that it consists of a single piece of cartilage, which
includes a median ventral part and two pairs of cornua. The median portion is

not, as usually represented, a separate element or copula, but is directly continuous
with the cornua. The thyroid cartilage of the monotremes agrees, therefore, with

that of the higher mammals in consisting of a single cartilaginous mass, but it

differs in that its anterior and posterior cornua pass from the small meJian portion,
or body, round the sides of the larynx in a dorsal and caudal direction nearly
parallel with one another, and the anterior cornua are further peculiar in being
continuous by a large part of their anterior borders with the posterior cornua of

the hyoid.

     According to Gegenbaur the cartilage of the epiglottis is a derivative of the

sixth post-oral visceral arch, Hu based this theory mainly upon hie observations to

 the effect that In the moiiotremes the epiglottis is composed of hyaline cartilage, and
 thus, in its primitive form, has the same histological structure as the other visceral

arches. The author's results are entirely opposed to those of Gegenbaur. He

found its structure to be similar to that of ordinary mammals, viz. yellow elastic
 cartilage. The existence of an abundant network of elastic fibres was demon-
strated by various stains, especially picric acid and orcein.

      Both the ontogeny and the phylogeny of the mammalian epiglottis support the
view that it is a single median structure, and not, as Gegenbaur believes, the result
of the fusion of two lateral elements.

      Gegenbaur's theory of the phylogeny of the epiglottis must be abandoned,
while the view of Dubois that it is a new formation of cartilage in the submucous

tissue, not represented in submammalian vertebrates, appears to me to be consistent
with the known facts of its structure, relations, and comparative anatomj'.

     The arytenoid cartilages of the monotremes closely resemble those of the
marsupialia except that they are relatively somewhat smaller. The interarytenoid
cartilage is present and has the same relations as in marsupials, but in both
echidna and ornithorhynchus there is an additional median cartilaginous element in

the ventral wall of the larynx posterior to the interarytenoids

             3. The Palpebral and Oculomotor Apparatus of Fishes.
                     By N. Bishop Harman, M.B., F.R.C.S.

     This paper is based upon observations drawn from the examination of seventy
species of fishes, a number which includes examples of most British and some

foreign species.

   --(1) Palpebral Apparatus. Gradations in form were found from siniple to

complex forms, but it was to be noted that this gradation did not coincide with
any plan of development of orders of iish, since the most complex were found in
species nearest the main line of phylogeny.

     The occurrence of simple forms of provision did not show any scheme of classi-
fication either from relation or habitat. In more complex forms an ' extra palpebral
fold ' found in salmon and herring appears to serve as a ' fender ' to the eye in fishes
frequenting river and seashore.

     The provision of greatest interest was found in the nictitating membrane of
selachians. The relative values of these folds in Carcharias, Galeus, Mustelus,
and ScylliuQi appear to depend on the coincident condition of the ordinary
palpebral margin. The certainty of the presence of this membrane in the last-
named fish was noted by observation on the living fish.

     The development of the membrane as an epiblast-clad fold of dermis springing
from the ocular a.spect of a previously formed lower lid was shown by serial

sections of the region in Mustelus embryos.
     The source of the complex musculature of the eyelids of these fish was traced

by the same means to the branchial musculature of the spiracle ; this remarkable
transference of muscle tissue from a branchial musculature to so dissimilar an
apparatus as palpebral folds was further shown by the inverse ratio existing
between the condition of spiracle and nictitating membrane. In those fish in
which the latter is at its highest development the spiracle is absent, and vice vei'sd.

     (2) JRelation of Bulb to Orbital If 'alls.- -The presence of an orbital sac was
noted. Between its least developed form as a bursal sac separating the bulb from

the underlying pharyngeal muscles in the fishing frog, to the large sac affording
complete investment to the orbit and to the structures within it, and the special
muscular evagination of the sac to form the recessus orbitalis of Holt in the
pleuronectids, a complete gradation of form can be traced.

     Investing the bulb was found a complete raembrane attached peripherally to
the palpebral folds, and affording tubular sheaths to the muscles the membrane in

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

its relations agreed well with the capsule of Tenon in the higher mammals.
    The eyes of many cartilaginous fishes are supported by a rod of cartilage

socket-jolut ; the stem is stayed by ligaments. In sbarljs it dwindles into a
slender rod, and is absent in some. Its origin was found to be by an independent

chondrification within the mesoblast packing of the orbit,

     The eyes of many bony fishes are supported by a ligament in close relation to
the optic nerve. The occurrence of the ligament was very frequent in fresh-water

tishes.

   --(3) Musculature. The eye-muscles of fishes are singularly uniform in their

relations. Among the variations found may be noted that in Zygana Maleus

The short M. recti are attached to the distant basis cranii by means of a long
common tendon.

     Provision for projection and retraction of the bulb was found in a few cases,
the special movement of the eyes of 1-eviopthalmus kuelreuteri is probably not of
this nature but of elevation and depression.

                                                               ;

     The formation of palpebral retractors by a superficial delamination of the
M. recti was noted in some cases.

   A special form of M. obliquus superior was found to exist in both eyes of all

pleuronectids, which provides for the rotation of the eye. This muscle consists
here of two parts, one like the normal M. obliquus superior of other fish, a second
in a long, slender, strap-like portion, which embraces the upper and outer qua-
drant of the bulb. The axis of vision of these fish can be noted to be frequently
in a state of convergence ; it is particularly interesting 1 1 note this specialisation

in this connection, since like conditions of the muscle are found in animals
possessing the capacity of convergence of visual axes, e.r/. horse and man. This
indicated the possibility of independent evolution of organs in widely severed

types along similar lines when the conditions of use are similar'.'

4, Tlie Pelvic Symjihysial Bone of the Indian Elephant.  ,

                By Professor R. J. Anderson.

    The symphysial cartilage of many mammals is often converted into bone.
Numerous examples have been noted and commented on by myself and others. It

is only necessary to refer to the fact that ligaments are often converted into bone.

The tentorium cerebelli of certain carnivora, the ligaments of the pelvis (sacro-
sciatic) in the sloth and armadillo, the tendons in the leg of the turkey, the supra-
scapular ligament iu man, and the abdominal fibrous bands in the crocodile, are
the often-cited examples of bones that are developed in tendinous or membranous

structures.

     The symphysial cartilage or bone has been, in the pelvis, regarded as the
equivalent (homologous to the whole or part) of the sternum, and has been called a
pelvisternum. Whether this be so or not, the actual condition of the bone is of

considerable morphological interest.

    Mr. Schliiter of Halle supplied to our Museum three years ago the rough skele-
ton of an elephant. When cleaned and mounted, it appeared to have been about
eight feet high at the shoulder. The ischio-pubic epiphyses are still separate, and

the iliac crest, still incomplete, is not united to the ilium. The head of the femur
and the great trochanter are not united to the shaft of the thigh-bone.

   A wedge-shaped bone exists between the pubes of opposite sides, the anterior

surface is triangular, is two and a half inches in height, and one and a quarter inches
wide This surffice is convex from below upwards. The lower surface, which is
keeled, is two and a half inches in length. The bone tapers posteriorly.

    The skeleton of the elephant in the National Museum of Ireland has a small pelvic
symphysial bone, and the camel in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons
of Ireland has also a well-formed example of the same bone. Many skeletons have,

however, been so well (?) cleaned that the symphyses have disappeared.

      It is not easy to account for the symphysial cartilage or bone morphologically,

    ' The paper has been published in cxfenw, with plates, in the Journal of Anatomy
and P/ii/sioloffi/, Nov. 1890, vol. ssxiv. p. 1.

but tlie otseTVations of Albrecht, although somewhat dlaconnected, are worthy o(
consideration. It will be remembered, however, that the sternum is in its incep-
tion very intimately connected with the rib arches, to which the ribs are hinged,
and which, with the spinal column, form the fixed bars on which the ribs swing,
and is, as nearly as possible, the result of the fusion of the lower ends of the ribs to
form a beam, from which the ribs are afterwards segmented and made to swing on
the sternal and dorsal hinges, whilst two rows of (lateral) centres of ossification
lead, in the course of development, to the solidification of the sternum. The sym-

physial cartilage, in man at least, presents occasionally for observation a pelvic

fissure.

     The hexagonal arrangement of the cells of bees has been generally ascribed to
a structural instinct of bees ; the object of this paper is now to show that the form
of the bee-cell is chiefly influenced by a kind of crystalline formation due to the
cooling of the wax.

                                 By James F. Gemiiill.

    The edible mussel {Mytiliis edidis) may be found at all different levels between

moderately high and low tide marks. The individuals are fixed, and feed only
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  783

when covered by water. Those which are placed high up in the tidal zone are

not so well nourished as those which have a lower position. The former have less
time during which feeding is possible, and are much smaller in size than the latter.

Mussels have the sexes separate. Tbeir larval free-swimming stage ceases before

sex is differentiated, as far as can be made out by bistological examination. There
is not a relatively greater number of females in the middle and lower zones, nor a
relatively greater number of males in the higber zones. The inference is that in

the mussel nutrition has no influence in determining sex.

     The common limpet {Patella vulgata) is also found everywhere in the tidal

zone. Its sexes are separate, and the free-swimming stage ceases before sex is
differentiated. The limpet is not fixed in the same sense as the mussel, but from

its habits it may be considered as practically fixed.

     The same facts regarding the numerical proportion of males and females at
different levels were found to bold good for the limpet as for the mussel, and the
same inferences were drawn. In the mussel and the limpet there are no well-
marked secondary sexual characters, and the ovary and testes are equal in bulk.

On the other hand, in the special animals in which nutrition has been distinctly

shown to influence the determination of sex tliere is a disproportion sometimes
extreme between the amounts of the male and female sexual products. This is
due chiefly to the fact that the eggs in these cases are provided with much deuto-
plasm, while the sperm is small in amount. The presence of deutoplasm in large

quantity cannot, however, be considered to be primitively characteristic of ova.
     Bearing of the foregoing on the general questions of the evolution and deter-

mination of sex.

                  By F. P. Moreno and A. Smith Woodward.

    On behalf of Dr. F. P. Moreno, Director of the La Plata Museum, Mr. A. Smith

"Woodward exhibited some newly discovered remains of the supposed extinct

ground-sloth Neoviylodon, discovered by Dr. R. Hauthal in a cavern in Patagonia.
The animal had previously been known only by a piece of armoured skin from the
same cavern. The new specimens comprised a skull, evidently broken by man,
and some well-preserved pieces of exciement. These were found beneath a layer
of earth in the cave, with a large quantity of hay and other evidence of the pre-
sence of man. The excrement showed tliat the animal fed on grasses and herbs,
not on the foliage of trees. The skull, which still showed pieces of flesh and carti-

lage adhering to it, seemed to be identical with one from the Pampa formation
further north, named Glossotherimn or Grypotherium, as already observed by Dr.
Santiago Roth, The theory of Dr. Hauthal, that these ground-sloths were kept
in captivity in the cave by the ancient Patagonians, was adversely criticised by
several speakers, and the fresh appearance of the specimens was specially com-

mented upon.

                               By W. Garstang, M,A.

     Recent experiments at the Ph'mouth laboratory witli thelarviis of the Butterfly
Blenny (Blennius ocellarii) Lave sbown that under suitable conditions the
metamorphosis of Teleostean larvos can be completed with a death-rate not
exceeding 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, of the original numbers. The failure of

MM. Fabre-Domergue and Bietrix in their experiments upon Coitus, and of

Cunningham in the case of other fishes, is probably to be attributed to their
employment either of absolutely stagnant water or of water in a state of

very slow circulation. In my experiments the mortality in the early stages

of development, when stagnant water was CTnployed, was invariably very
hio-h. The larvfc remained inactive and refused to feed, exactly as in the experi-
ments of the French observers. But if during the first week of development the
water was kept in a constant state of gentle agitation by means of the ' plunger '
devised by Messrs. Allen and Brown, the larvae remained healthy and active, and
were incessantly on the look-out for food particles. On the other hand, agitation

of the water appears to be unnecessary in the later stages of development, for if

the larvje are kept healthy in agitated water during the first week of their
development they may complete their metamorphosis in absolutely stagnant water,
provided it is properly oxygenated and supplied with food, and is kept free from

the accumulation of organic debris.

    The success of my later experiments was so complete that I propose to continue

them on a larger scale during the' coming spawning season with the larvae of
food-fishes, iu the hope of throwing light upon the difficult problems of sea-fish

culture.

                            By Dr. C. G. Jon. Petersen.

     The Limfjord runs right across tbe northern part of the peninsula of Jutland,
there being an entrance from the North Sea at Tbyboron, and another from the

Cattegat at ILils. The distance between these two entrances is about ninety

English miles.
      'Jhe fjord consists of several extensive broads connected with each other by-

sounds and narrow channels. The total area of the water-surface is estimated at
416 square English miles. The average depth is between three and four ^afhoms,
and the greatest depth is only twelve fathoms. Close to the shore, and where strong
currents prevail, the bottom consists of shells, gravel, and sand, but elsewhere it is
a soft blue mud. Zustera maritima grows in great luxuriance in most of the
shallow reaches. In summer the temperature of the water of the Limfjord is
several degrees higher than that of the North Sea and Cattegat, but in winter it is
much lower, and the surface is then frequently covered with a thick layer of ice.
The salinity of the water decreases from the North Sea towards the inner Broads,
where it was often nearly fresh. There is scarcely any tide ; the rise and fall of
level, and the currents are chiefly determined by the action of the wind. The shores
of the Limfjord are varied and picturesque, many of the hills being crowned by
the characteristic Viking Mounds.

     The fjord has witnessed many changes. During the Stone Age the water
stood at a higher level and was much Salter, especially in the eastern part. This

is proved by the position, far from the present shore, of the ancient kitchen-
middens with abundance of oyster shells. This salt-water period was followed by
several others, in some of which the water became nearly fresh ; the oysters dis-

appeared, and the fjord contained many fresh-water fish. The last great change
took place in 1825, when the North Sea broke into the fjord near Thyboron. The
water, in consequence, became Salter, and the oysters subsequently returned to the

tjord.

     The Thyboron Channel is now about half a mile wide ; the navigable part, with
a depth of eight to twelve feet, is kept open by the continual work of a Hopper
dredger. The Nissum Broad, which is in direct communication with the North

Sea by means of this channel, has an area of about seventy square miles. This
Broad is every year crowded with small plaice. I estimate that there is here at
least one plaice on every square fathom of the bottom, a calculation made by means
of counting all the plaice fished with a plaice-seine on difierent places of the
Broad, every haul describing an area of about one-quarter Tonde Land (1 Tonde
Land = ly^ acre).' On July 1 last a haul was made herewith a Danish plaice-
seine, for the information of some of the delegates to the recent Stockholm Con-
ference. The whole operation occupied less than an hour, and 3,400 plaice were
landed on the deck of the fishery steamer Sallingsi'md. The majority of these fish
measured between seven and eight inches, a few were much smaller, and only one
measured thirteen inches.

     No fertilised plaice eggs have ever been observed in this or any other part of
the Limfjord, but plaice from two to seven inches in length come in from the North
Sea in abundance in spring. Many of these migrate farther into the tjord, but

others migrate out into the North Sea again, in winter, for specimens labelled in
the Nissum Broad have been captured in the North Sea.'- The plaice does not
breed in the fjord ; but the fry of the year immigrates in the course of the year
from the North Sea. The plaice are so crowded in the Nissum Broad, that "they
do not grow fast from want of sufficient food. Labelled specimens were found
to have grown only half an inch in six months, while other specimens from the
Nissum Broad, placed in another Broad at the same time, increased five inches in
length during the same period.^

tions have been made by an apparatus whicli covers one square foot bottom surface

and takes up all invertebrates (bivalves, worms, &c.) living on this. In this way
it was shown that there are many places where 1,400 bivalves (Abra, Corbula, and

Solen) live on one square foot bottom surface, and that, for instance, in theThisted

Bi'oad, where the plaice grows quicker and becomes larger than in the other Broads,

food suitable for plaice is not more abundant than in the other Broads. The

diflerent growth must therefore be owing to the difierent number of fish per Tonde

    On July 2, a haul of the seine, under precisely similar conditions as in Nissum
Broad, was taken in Kaas Broad, which is farther removed from the North Sea

entrance than the A'issum Broad. This haul yielded only 1,400 plaice, but they

were of larger size, the majority measuring eight and a half to nine and a half

Myinches.  view that the small size and slow growth of the plaice in the Nissum

Broad is due to overcrowding is confirmed by the interesting experiments in the

Thisted Broad. One haul v/as made on July 3, 1899, in this Broad, and thirty-six
plaice were caught ; all these fish were of a larger size than those in the other

Broads, and their damaged fin-rays showed that they all really were transplanted.

The transplantation of these fish was made in March and April 1899. This Broad

is about forty miles from the North Sea entrance at Thyboron, and a few years

ago contained practically no plaice. Thousands of plaice from seven to ten inches

in length are now every year transported by the fishermen, partly aided by a

Government grant, from the North Sea to this Thisted Broad in April, and it has

been found that, by November of the same year, they have grown to thirteen and

fifteen inches in length. Generally speaking, these transplanted fish weigh one-

fifth of a pound when put into the Thisted Broad in April, and weighed one pound
when taken out in November.

The cost of transplanting a young plaice from the North Sea is one-sixth of a

penny, and the value of tlie plaice, when recaptured in November, is fourpence.

Last year, between 100,000 and 200,000 were transplanted in this way, and prac-

tically all the fish were recaptured for the market.

I believe that there is food enough in the Thisted Broad to support 30,000

plaice on every square mile, so that 500,000 mieht be transported to this Broad

annually. There are other Broads in the Limfjord where there are now no plaice,

and it is believed that 3,000,000 plaice might be transplanted to the Limfjord

annually. Should this scheme of fish culture be carried out, there would be an

enormous increase in the value of the Banish plaice fisheries. There is now before

the Danish Parliament a bill asking for a grant of 1 ,000/. a year for transplanting

these young plaice, with the view of finding out how many of these fish can live

on each square mile of the fjord and, at the same time, yield an economic result in

the direction here indicflted.

     Although there is at present no definite statistical information on the subject,

I am of opinion that there is no diminution in the number of small immature

plaice on the coasts of Denmark. Nature appears to yield a constant and abund-

ant supply. The supply of food does not seem to be sufficient for the young fish

in many places. On the other hand, my researches in the Cattegat show that there

large-sized spawning plaice have diminished in number.

Dr. J. Hjort has this year transplanted from the Danish coast 22,000 small

plaice to  the Christiania fjord in Norway                                                                                                                            it will be  most interesting                                               to learn the

     Should these prove successful, there can be little doubt that a similar kind of

fish culture could be carried on in many of the sea lochs of other countries.

3, On the Occurrence oj the Grey Gurnard (Trigla gurnaidus, L.), and
     its Spavming in the Inshore and Offshore Waters, By W. C.

      McIntosh.

      In the following remarks the grey gurnard is used to illustrate certain features
of the resources of the sea, and it is of some importance in this respect, though it
has to be remembered that the gurnard is a fish that often swims in mid-water,

and occasionally may be caught near the surface.
      In the Trawling Investigations of 1884 (Royal Commission, under Lord

Dalhousie), the grey gurnard ranked, as regards numbers, third in the list of
saleable fishes, only the haddock and the whiting exceeding it in total numbers.
In that report the fishes, as they ought to be in all such inquiries, were arranged
according to months as well as stations, and it appears therefrom that few gurnards
occur in the trawl in January or February, but they are found in large numbers in

March, increase still more in April, and in May attain their maximum in St.

Andrews Bay. They remain in fair, though smaller numbers, in the bay in June,
July, and August, and in the latter month even increase in numbers at nine miles
from land. Their occurrence, however, is not confined to inshore waters, for at
Smith Bank, off" Caithness, they were in considerable numbers in April, and many
not fully ripe, and so in 24 to 30 fathoms water, 4 to 8 miles S.E. of the Isle of Man.

     Again, in May, in water 32 to 40 fathoms in depth, and 25 to 38 miles from
land, they were also in considerable numbers, and spawning. In June and July
they were still found in offshore waters, and some spawning. In the middle of
August large gurnards were extremely numerous 15 miles from land, two hauls of
the trawl giving respectively 363 and 456 specimens. These facts showed that
gurnards were scarce in the trawl, both in inshore and offshore waters in the early

months, became more conspicuous in both in April, had high numbers in May and

June in inshore waters, and considerable numbers in offshore waters. The distri-
bution of the species was further alluded to in the ' Food-fishes.' ^

      In the ' Resources of the Sea,' the gurnard, from the returns of the Garlay^d^
formed one of the most conspicuous features in connection with the round fishes,

--and showed, more or less, the spindle formed by marine animals vertebrate and
--invertebrate during the year, the wide central part of the spindle occurring in

the warmer months, and the figure tapering ofi^to a point in January and again in
December. Difl^erent areas, however, vary : thus in St. Andrews Bay the capture

of gurnards is nearly double that in the Fortli, and the larger forms (over 11 inches)
show a great increase in August, while those from 7 to 10 inches, and those

under 7 inches, have their maximum, during the decade, in June. It must be
borne in mind that in this area, however, there were serious blanks in the decade
in the important months of May and August.

    In the Forth, again, the maximum captures of the gurnards over 11 inches

are found in the ten years (and taking each year by itself) to fall in no less than
si.x months, viz. April, May, June, July, August, and September, the number of

times in each month varying. May has the pre-eminence of three maxima, yet

August remains steadily high throughout, as in the totals for fishes generally in

the returns of the Garland. It is doubtful, however, if such increase in Auarust
is due to a ' second migration,' like the herring, for spawning purposes, as Dr.

Fulton, the able superintendent of the Fishery Board's investigations, supposes.

Of the ne.xt size (7 to 10 inches), the maxima are found in two months only, viz.

May and June, and August never attains prominence. Those under 7 inches

--have their maxima in five months, viz. from May to October July being absent.

    Now the fact that the smaller forms (most of which do not spawn) show a

decided tendency to increase in certain months, should make caution necessary in
attributing the increase in inshore waters in August to this function (spawning).
Experience proves that the spawning of the gurnard goes on from the end of
April till September, and that no special accession of ova occurs in August

indeed, the eggs aie fewer than in June. Moreover, spawning gurnards are

common in the offshore waters during the same period, and while it is rare to find
post-larval and very young gurnards in St. Andrews Bay or the Forth, they occur

in numbers in the offshore waters. Again, as above mentioned, there are other
fishes which show an increase in August, and though that of the larger sizes is
not so pronounced, still such increase has to be taken into consideration.

      It is curious that the grey gurnard, though stated to be inshore spawned in the
blue-book (just as the dab is also in error claimed as an inshore spawner), has not
teen used by the Fishery Board of Scotland to substantiate their large closures of

areas against trawling. The following table may explain the cause of the silence

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

The President delivered the followinp; Address:

Is his openino' Address to the members of the British Association at the Ipswich

meeting, the President cast a retrospective glance at the progress that had taken

place in the several branches of scientitic iuquiry from the time of the formation of

the Association in 1831 down to 18U5, the year in which were published the last

two of the fifty volumes of Reports containing the scientific results of the voyage

of H.M.S. Challenger. In that very able and detailed review there is no reference

"whatever to the work of the numerous expeditions which had been fitted out by

this and other countries for the exploration of the depths of the sea, nor is there

any mention of the great advance in our knowledge of the ocean during the period

of sixty-five years then under consideration. This omission may be accounted for

by the fact that, at the time of the formation of the British Association, knowledge

concerning the ocean was, literally speaking, superficial. The studj^ of marine

phenomena had hitherto been almost entirely limited to the surface and shallow

waters of the ocean, to the survey of coasts and of oceanic routes directly useful

for commercial purposes. Down to that time there had been no systematic

attempts to ascertain the physical and biological conditions of those regions of the

earth's surface covered by the deeper waters of the ocean ; indeed, most of the

apparatus necessary for such investigations had not yet been invented.

The difficulties connected with the exploration of the greater depths of the

sea arise principally from the fact that, in the majority of cases, the observations

are necessarily indirect. At the surface of the ocean direct observation is possible,

but our knowledge of the conditions prevailing in deep water, and of all that is

there taking place, is almost wholly dependent on the correct working of instru-

ments, the action of -which at the critical moment is hidden from sight.

It was the desire to establish telegraphic communication between Europe and

America that gave the first direct impulse to the scientific exploration of the great

ocean-basins, and at the present day the survey of new cable routes still yields

each year a large amount of accurate knowledge regarding the tioor of the ocean.

Immediately before the Challenger Expedition there was a marked improvement

in all the apparatus used in marine investigations, and thus during the Challenger

Expedition the great ocean-basins were for the first time systematically and

successfully explored. This expedition, which lasted for nearly four years, was

successful beyond the expectations of its promoters, and opened out a new era in

Athe study of oceanography.  great many sciences were enriched by a grand

accumulation of new facts. Large collections were sent and brought home,

and were subsequently described by specialists belonging to almost every civilised

nation. Since the Challenger Expedition there has been almost a revolution in the

methods employed in deep-sea observations. The most profound abysses of the
ocean are now being everywhere examined by sailors and scientific men with
increasing precision, rapidity, and success.

     The recognition of oceanography as a distinct branch of science may be said to
date from the commencement ol the Challenger investigations. The fuller knowledge
we now possess about all oceanic phenomena has had a great modifying influ-
ence on many general conceptions as to the nature and extent of those changes
which the crust of the earth is now undergoing and has undergone in past geological
times. Our knowledge of the ocean is still very incomplete. So much has, how-

ever, already been acquired that the historian will, in all probability, point to the

oceanographical discoveries during the past forty years as the most important
addition to the natural knowledge of our planet since the great geographical

voyages a.=<sociated with the names of ColumlDus, Da Gama, and Magellan, at the

end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth centuries.

    It is not my intention on this occasion to attempt anything like a general

review of the present state of oceanographic science. But, as nearly all the samples

of marine deposits collected during the past thirty years have passed through my

hands, I shall endeavour briefly to point out what, in general, their detailed exami-

nation teaches with respect to the present condition of the floor of the ocean, and I

will thereafter indicate what appears to me to be the bearing of some of these

results on speculations as to the evolution of the existing surface features of our

planet.

                    Depth of the Ocean.

     All measurements of depth, by which we ascertain the relief of that part of

the  earth's crust  covered by water, are referred  to  the sea-surface                                                          the  measure-
                                                                                                                              ;

ments of height on the land are likewise referred to sea-level. It is admitted

that the ocean has a very complicated undulating surface, in consequence of the

attraction which the heterogeneous and elevated portions of the lithosphere

exercise on the liquid hydrosphere. In the opinion of geodesists the geoid may

in some places depart from the figure of the spheroid by 1,000 feet. Still it is not

likely that this surface of the geoid departs so widely from the mean ellipsoidal

form as to introduce a great error into our estimates of the elevations and de-

pressions on the surface of the lithosphere.

     The soundings over the water-surface of the globe have accumulated at a rapid

rate during the past fifty years. In the shallow water, where it is necessary

to know the depth for purposes of navigation, the soundings may now be spoken of

as innumerable ; the 100-fathom line surrounding the land can therefore often be

drawn in with much exactness. Compared with this shallow-water region, the

soundings in deep water beyond the 100-fathom line are much less numerous

each year, however, there are large additions to our knowledge. AVithiu the

last decade over ten thousand deep soundings have been taken by British ships

alone. The deep soundings are scattered over the different ocean-basins in varying

proportions, being now most numerous in the North Atlantic and South-west

Pacific, and in these two regions the contour-lines of depth may be drawn in with

greater confidence than in the other divisions of the great ocean-basins. It may

be pointed out that 659 soundings taken quite recently during cable surveys in the

Noi th Atlantic, although much closer together than is usually the case, and yield-

ing much detailed information to cable engineers, have, from a general point of

view, necessitated but little alteration in the contour-lines drawn on the Challenger

bathymetrical maps published in 1895. Again, the recent soundings of the

German s.s. Valdivia in the Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans have not caused

very great alteration in the positions of the contour-lines on the Challenger

maps, if we except one occasion in the South Atlantic when a depth of 2,000

fathoms was expected and the sounding machine recorded a depth of only 536

fathoms, and again in the great Southern Ocean when depths exceeding 3,000

fathoms were obtained in a region where the contour-lines indicated between 1,000

and 2,000 fathoms. This latter discovery suggests that the great depth recorded

by Ross to the south-east of South Georgia may not be very far from the truth.

      I have redrawn the several contour-lines of depth in the great ocean-basins,

after careful consideration of the most recent data, and these may now be re-
garded as a somewhat close approximation to the actual state of "matters, with

the possible exception of the great Southern and Antarctic Oceans, where there
are relatively few soundings, but where the projected Antarctic Expeditions should

soon be at work. On the whole, it may be said that the general tendency of

recent soundings is to extend the area with depths greater than 1,000 fiithoms,
and to show that numerous volcanic cones rise from the general level of the floor
of the ocean-basins up to various levels beneath the sea-surface.

    The areas marked out by the contour-lines of depth are now estimated aa

From these results it appears that considerably more than half of the sea

floor Uee at a depth exceeding 2,000 fathoms, or over two geographical miles. It

is interesting to note that the area within the lOO-fathom line occupies 7,000,000

square geographical miles, whereas the area occupied by the next succeeding 900

fathoms (viz. between 100 and 1,000 fathoms) occupies only 10,000,000 square

geographical miles. This points to a relatively rapid descent of the sea-floor along

the continental slopes between 100 and 1,000 fathoms, and therefore confirms the

results gained by actual soundings in this region, many of which indicate steep

inclines or even perpendicular cliffs. Not only arc the continental slopes the seat
of many deposit-slips and seismic disturbances, but Mr. Benest has given good

reasons for believing that underground rivers sometimes enter the sea at depths

beyond 100 fathoms, and there bring about sudden changes in deep water. Again,

the relatively large area covered by the continental shelf between the shore°-Uue

and 100 fathoms points to the wearing away of the land by current and wave

action.

    On the Challenger charts all areas where the depth exceeds 3,000 fathoms

have been called ' Deeps,' and distinctive names have been conferred upon them.

Forty-three such depressions are now known, and the positi(.ns of these are shown

on  the  map  here exhibited                                                                     twenty-four                                                                      are  situated   in the Pacific Ocean, three

min the Indian Ocean, fifteen the Atlantic Ocean, and one in the Southern and

Antarctic Oceans. The area occupied by these thirty-nine deeps is estimated at

7,152,000 square geographical miles, or about 7 per cent, of the total water-surface

of the globe. Within these deeps over 250 soundings have been recorded, of which

twenty-four exceed 4,000 fathoms, including three exceeding 5,000 fathoms.

    Depths exceeding 4,000 fathoms (or four geographical miles) have been recorded

within eight of the deeps, viz. in the North Atlantic within the Nares Deep ; in

the Antarctic within the Ross Deep                                                                                                                                            in  the  Banda  Sea  within the Weber Deep

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

in the North Pacific within the Challenger, Tuscarora, and Supau Deeps ; and in

the South Pacific within the Aldrich and Richards Deeps. Depths exceeding

5,000 fathoms have been hitherto recorded only within the Aldrich Deep of the

South Pacific, to the east of the Kermadecs and Friendly Islands, where the

greatest depth is 5,165 fathoms, or 530 feet more than five geographical miles,

being about 2,000 feet more below the level of the sea than the summit of Mount

Everest in the Himalayas is above it. The levels on the surface of the lithosphere

thus oscillate between the limits of about ten geographical miles (more than

eighteen kilometres).

                                        Temperature of the Ocean-floor.

     Our knowledge of the temperature on the floor of the ocean is derived from
observations in the layers of water immediately above the bottom by mtans of
792 REPORT-- 1899*

deep-sea tbenilometei's, from the electric resistance of telegraph cables resting oil

the bed of the great ocean-basins, and from the temperature of large masses of

mud and ooze brought up by the dredge from great depths. These observations

are now sufficiently numerous to permit of some general statements as to the

distribution of temperatui'e over the bottom of the great oceans.

All the temperatures recorded up to the present time in the sub-surface waters

of the open ocean indicate that at a depth of about 100 fathoms seasonal variation

of temperature disappears. Beyond that depth there is a constant, or nearly

constant, temperature at any one place throughout the year. In some special

positions, and under some peculiar conditions, a lateral shitting of large bodies of

water takes place on the iloor of the ocean at depths greater than lOO fathoms.

This phenomenon has been well illustrated by Professor Libbey off the east coast

of North America, where the Gulf Stream and Labrador Current run side by side

in opposite directions. This lateral shitting cannot, however, be called seasonal,

for it appears to be effected by violent storms, or strong off-shore winds bringing

up colder water from considerable depths to supply the place of the surface

drift, so that the colder water covers stretches of the ocean's bed which under

normal conditions are overlaid by warmer strata of water. Sudden changes of

temperature like these cause the destruction of innumerable marine animals, and

produce very marked peculiarities in the deposits over the areas thus affected.

It is estimated that 92 per cent, of the entire sea-floor has a temperature lower

than 40° F. This is in striking contrast to the temperature prev.ailing at the surface

of the ocean, only 16 per cent, of which has a mean temperature under 40° F.

The temperature over nearly the whole of the floor of the Indian Ocean in deep

Awater is under 35° F.  similar temperature occurs over a large part of the

South Atlantic and certain parts of the Pacific, but at the bottom of the North

Atlantic basin and over a very large portion of the Pacific the temperature is

higher than 35° F. In depths beyond 2,000 fathoms, the average temperature

over the floor of the North Atlantic is about 2° F. above the average temperature

at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic, while the average tempera-

ture of the bed of the Pacific is intermediate between these.

It is admitted that the low temperature of the deep sea has been acquired at

the surface in Polar and sub-Polar regions, chiefly within the higher latitudes of

the southern hemisphere, where the cooled surface water sinks to the bottom and

spreads slowly over the floor of the ocean into equatorial regions. These cold

waters carry with them into the deep sea the gases of the atmosphere, which are
everywhere taken up at the surface according to the known laws of gas absorp-

tion. In this way myriads of living animals are enabled to carry on their exist-

ence at all depths in the open ocean. The nitrogen remains more or less constant
at all times and places, but the proportion of oxygen is frequently much reduced in

deep water, owing to the processes of oxidation and respiration which are there

going on.

The deep sea is a region of darkness as well as of low temperature, for the

direct rays of the sun are wholly absorbed in passing through the superficial layers

of water. Plant-life is in consequence quite absent over 93 per cent, of the bottom

of the ocean, or 66 per cent, of the whole surface of the lithosphere. The abundant

deep-sea fauna, which covers the floor of the ocean, is therefore ultimately dependent

for food upon organic matter assimilated by plants near its surface, in the shallower

waters near the coast-lines, and on the surface of the dry land itself.

As has been already stated, about 7,000,000 square geographical miles of the

sea-floor lies within the 100-fathom line, and this area is in consequence subject to

seasonal variations of temperature, to strong currents, to the effects of sunlight,

and presents a great variety of physical conditions. The planktonic plant-life is
here reinforced by the littoral seaweeds, and animal-life is very abundant. About
40 per cent, of the water over the bottom of this shallow-water area has a mean
temperature undt^r 40° F., while 20 per cent has a mean temperature between 40°

and 60° F., and 40 per cent, a temperature of over 60° F.

It follows from this that only 3 per cent, of the floor of the ocean presents

conditions of temperature favourable for the vigorous growth of corals and those
TRAXSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  79

Otlier bentlionic organisms which make up coral reefs and require a temperature
of over 60° F. all the year round. On the other hand, more than half of the sm-face
of the ocean has a temperature which never falls below 60° F. at any time of the

year. In these surface-waters with a high temperature, the shells of pelagic
Molluscs, Foraminifera, AJgae, and other planlitonic organisms are secreted in great
abundance, and fall to the bottom after death.

     It thus happens that, at the present time, over nearly the whole floor of the

ocean we have mingled in the deposits the remains of organisms which had lived

under widely diiferent physical conditions, since the remains of organisms which
lived in tropical sunlight, and in water at a temperature above 80° F., all their

lives, now lie buried in the same deposit on the sea-floor together with the remains

of other organisms which lived all their lives in darlcness and at a temperature

near to the freezing-point of fresh water.

                                   Marine Deposits on the Ocean-floor.

    The marine deposits now forming over the floor of the ocean present many

interesting peculiarities according to their geographical and bathymetrical position.

On tlie continental shelf, within the 100-fathom line, sands and gravels predomi-

nate, while on the continental slopes beyond ibe 100-fathom line, Blue Muds, Green

Muds, and Red Muds, together with Volcanic Muds and Coral Muds, prevail, the
two latter kinds of deposits being, however, more characteristic of the shallow
water around oceanic islands. The composition of all these Terrigenous Deposits
depends on the structure of the adjoining land. Around continental shores, e.xcept
where coral reefs, limestones, and volcanic rocks are present, the materials consist

principally of fragments and minerals derived from the disintegration of the ancient

rocks of the continents, the most characteristic and abundant mineral species being

quartz. River detritus extends in many instances far from the land, while off" high
and bold coasts, where no large rivers enter the sea, pelagic conditions may be
ibund in somewhat close proximity to the shore-line. It is in these latter positions
that Green Muds containing much glauconite, and other deposits containing many

phosphatic nodules, have for the most part been found; as, for instance, off' the

eastern coast of the United States, off" the Cape of Good Hope, and off' the eastern
coasts of Australia and Japan. The presence of glauconitic grains and phosphatic

nodules in the deposit at these places appears to be very intimately associated with
a great annual range of temperature in the surface aiid shallow waters, and the

consequent destruction of myriads of marine animals. As an example of this
phenomenon may be mentioned the destruction of the tile-fish in the spring of 1882
otf the eastern coast of North America, when a layer six feet in thickness of dead
fish and other marine animals was believed to cover the ocean-floor for many

square miles.

      In all the Terrigenous Deposits the evidences of the mechanical action of tides, of

currents, and of a great variety of physical conditions, may almost everywhere be

detected, and it is possible to recognise in these deposits an accumulation of mate-
rials analogous to many of the marine stratified rocks of the continents, such as
sandstones, quartzites, shales, marls, greensands, chalks, limestones, conglomerates,
and volcanic grits.

     With increasing depth and distance from the continents the deposits gradually
lose their terrigenous character, the particles derived directly from the emerged

land decrease in size and in number, the evidences of mechanical action disappear,
and the deposits pass slowly into what have been called Pelagic Deposits at an
average distance of about 200 miles from continental coast-lines. The materials
composing Pelagic Deposits are not directly derived from the disintegration of the

continents and other land-surfaces. They are largely made up of the shells and

skeletons of marine organisms secreted in the surface waters of the ocean, consist-
ing either of carbonate of lime, such as pelagic Molluscs, pelagic Foraminifera, and
pelagic Algse, or of silica, such as Diatoms and Radiolarians. The inorganic con-
stituents of the Pelagic Deposits are for the most part derived from the attrition of
floating pumice, from the disintegration of water-logged pumice, from showers of
         --;

--794 REPORT 1899.

volcanic aslies, and from the debris ejected from submarine volcanoes, together
with the products of their decomposition. Quartz particles, which play so
important a role in the Terrigenous Deposits, are almost wholly absent, except
where the surface waters of the ocean are affected by floating ice, or where the
prevailing winds have driven the desert sands lar into the oceanic areas. Glau-
conite is likewise absent from these abysmal regions. The various kinds of Pelagic
Deposits are named according to their characteristic constituents, Pteropod Oozes,
Globigerina Oozes, Diatom Oozes, liadiolarian Oozes, and Red Clay.

     The distribution of the deep-sea deposits over the floor of the ocean is shown
on the map here exhibited, but it must be remembered that there is no sharp line
of demarcation between them ; the Terrigenous pass gradually into the Pelagic
Deposits, and the varieties of each of these great divisions also pass insensibly
the one into the other, so that it is often difiicult to fix the name of a given

sample.

    On another map here exhibited the percentage distribution of carbonate of lime

in the deposits over the floor of the ocean has been represented, the results being

founded on an extremely large number of analyses. The results are also shown

in the following table :

The carbonate of lime shells derived from the surface play a great and puzzling

rule in all deep-sea deposits, varying in abundance according to the depth of the

ocean and the temperature of the surface waters. In tropical regions removed

from land, where the depths are less than GOO fathoms, the carbonate of lime due

to the remains of these organisms from the surface may rise to 80 or 90 per cent.

with increase of depth, and under the same surface conditions, the percentage of

carbonate of lime slowly diminishes, till, at depths of about 2,000 fathoms, the

average percentage falls to about 60, at 2,400 fathoms to about 30, and at about

2,600 fathoms to about 10, beyond which depth there may be only traces of

carbonate of lime due to the presence of surface shells. The thin and more delicate

surface shells first disappear from the deposits, the thicker and denser ones alone

Apersist to greater depths.  careful examination of a large number of obser-

vations shows that the percentage of carbonate of lime in the deposits falls off

much more rapidly at depths between 2,200 and 2,500 fathoms than at other

depths.

    The Red Clay, which occurs in all the deeper stretches of the ocean far from

--land, and covers nearly half of the whole sea-floor, contains in addition to vol-
--canic dibris, clayey matter, the oxides of iron and manganese numerous remains

of whales, sharks, and other fishes, together with zeolitic crystals, manganese

nodules, and minute magnetic spherules, which are believed to have a cosmic

origin. One haul of a small trawl in the Central Pacific brought to the surface on

one occasion, from a depth of about two and a half miles, many bushels of

manganese nodules, along with fifteen hundred sharks' teeth, over fifty fragments

of earbones and other bones of whales. Some of these organic remains, such as

the Carcharodon and Lamna teeth and the bones of the Ziphioid whales, belong

apparently to extinct species. One or two of these sharks' teeth, earbones, or

cosmic spherules, may be occasionally found in a Globigerina Ooze, but their

occurrence in this or any deposits other than Red Clay is extremely rare.

     Our knowledge of the marine deposits is limited to the superficial layers as a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

rule the soundirg-tube does not penetrate more than six or eight inches, but in

some positions the sounding-tube and dredge have been known to sink fully two feet

into the deposit. Sometimes a Red Clay is overlaid by a Globigerina Ooze,

more frequently a Red Clay overlies a Globigerina Ooze, the transition between

the two layers being either abrupt or gradual. In some positions it is jiossible to
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  705

 account for these layers by referriug them to changes in the condition of the

  surface waters, but in other situations it seems necessary to call in elevations and

  subsidences of the sea-floor.

       If the whole of the carbonate of lime shells be removed by dilute acid from a
  typical sample of Globigerina Ooze, the inorganic residue left behind is quite

 similar in composition to a typical Red Clay. This suggests that possibly, owing to
 some hypogene action, such as the escape of carbonic acid through the sea-fioor,

 a deposit that once was a Globigerina Ooze might be slowly converted into a Red
 (;iay. However, this is not the interpretation which commends itself after an

 examination of all the data at present available ; a consideration of the rate of
 accumulation probably affords a more correct interpretation. It appears

 certain that the Terrigenous Deposits accumulate much more rapidly than
 the Pelagic Deposits. Among the Pelagic Deposits the Pteropod and Globi-
 gerina Oozes of the tropical regions, being made up of the calcareous shells of
 a much larger number of tropical species, apparently accumulate at a greater rate

 than the Globigerina Oozes in extra-tropical areas. Diatom Ooze being composed
 of both calcareous and siliceous organisms has again a more rapid rate of deposition

 than Radiolarian Ooze. In Red Clay the minimum rate of accumulation takes
 place. The number of sharks' teeth, of earbones and other bones of Cetaceans,
 and of cosmic spherules, in a deposit may indeed be taken as a measure of the rate

 pf deposition. These spherules, teeth, and bones are probably more abundant
in the Red Clays, because few other substances there fall to the bottom to cover
them up, and they thus form an appreciable part of the whole deposit. The
volcanic materials in a Red Clay having, becau.se of the slow accumulation, been
for a long time exposed to the action of sea-water, have been profoundly altered.
The massive manganese-iron nodules and zeolitic crystals present in the deposit
are secondary products arising from the decomposition of these volcanic materials,

just as the formation of glauconite, phosphatic, and calcareous and bary tic nodules
accompanies the decomposition of terrigenous rocks and minerals in deposits nearer
continental shores. There is thus a striking difference between the averajre
chemical and mineralogical composition of Terrigenous and Pelagic Deposits.

     It would be extremely interesting to have a detailed examination of one of
those deep holes wliere a typical Red Clay is present, and even to bore some depth
into such a deposit if possible, for in these positions it is probable that not more
than a few feet of deposit have accumulated since the close of the Tertiary period.
One such area lies to the south-west of Australia, and its examination might
possibly form part of the programme of the approaching Antarctic explorations"

                                                    Life on the Ocean-jioor.

      It has already been stated that plant-life is limited to the shallow waters, but
fishes and members of all the invertebrate groups are distributed over the floor of

the ocean at all depths. The majority of these deep-sea animals live by eating
the mud, clay, or ooze, or by catching the minute particles of organic matter
which tall from the surface. It is probably not far from the truth to say that
three-fourths of the deposits now covering the floor of the ocean have passed
through the alimentary canals of marine animals. These mud-eating species, many
ot which are of gigantic size when compared with their allies living in the shallow
coastal waters, become in turn the prey of numerous rapacious animals armed with
peculiar prehensile and tactde organs. Some fishes are blind, while others have
very large eyes. Phosphorescent light plays a most important role in the deep
sea, and is correlated with the prevailing red and brown colours of deep-sea

organisms. Phosphorescent organs appear sometimes to act as a bull's-eve lantern
to enable particles of food to be picked un, and at other times as a lure or a warning.

All these peculiar adaptations indicate that the struggle for life may be not much

less severe in the deep sea than in the shallower waters of the ocean.

     Many deep-sea animals present archaic characters ; still the deep sea cannot be

said to contain more remnants of faunas which flourished in remote geological
periods than the shallow and fresh waters of the continents. Indeed, kin-r-crabs
706 REPORT--1899.

Lingulas, Trigouias, Port Jackson sharks, Ceratodus, Lepidosiren, and Protopterus,
probably represent older faunas than anything- to be found in the deep sea.

     Sir Wyville Thomson was of opinion that, from the Silurian period to the
present day, there had been as now a continuous deep ocean with a bottom tem-
perature oscillating about the freezing-point of fresh water, and that there had
alwaj sheen an abyssal fauna. I incline to the view that in PaltBozoic times the
ocean-basins were not so deep as they are now ; that the ocean then had through-
out a nearly uniform high temperature, and that life was either absent or represented
only by bacteria and other low forms in great depths, as is now the case in the
Black Sea, where life is practically absent beyond 100 fathoms, and where the

deeper waters are saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen. This is not, however,
the place to enter on speculations concerning the origin of the deep-sea fauna,
nor to dwell on what has been called ' bipolarity ' in the distribution of marine
organisms.

                                                Evolution of the Cotitinental and Oceanic Areas.

I have now pointed out what appear to me to be some of the more general

results arrived at in recent years regarding the present condition of the floor of

the ocean. I may now be permitted to indicate the possible bearing of theto

results on opinions as to the origin of some fundamental geographical phenomena
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

for instance, on the evolution of the protruding continents and sunken ocean-basins.

In dealing with such a problem much that is hypothetical must necessarily be

introduced, but these speculations are based on ascertained scientific facts.

The well-known American geologist, Dutton, says: 'It has been much the

habit of geologists to attempt to explain the progressive elevation of plateaus and

mountain platforms, and also the folding of strata, by one and the same process.

I hold the two processes to be distinct, and having no necessary relation to each

other. There are plicated regions which are little or not at all elevated, and

there are elevated regions which are not plicated.' Speaking of great regional

uplifts, he says farther: ' What the real nature of the uplifting force may be is,
to my mind, an entire mystery, but I think we may discern at least one of its

attributes, and that is a gradual expansion or a diminution of density of the

Wesubterranean magmas. . . .                                     know of no cause which could either add to the

mass or diminish the density, yet one of the two must surely have happened. . . .
Hence I infer that the cause which elevates the land involves an expansion of the

underlying magmas, and the cause which depresses it is a shrinkage of the

magmas                                     the  nature  of  the  process  is  at  present  a complete  mystery.'  I shall
                                        ;

endeavour to show how the detailed study of marine deposits may help to solve

the mystery here referred to by Dutton.

The surface of the globe has not always been as we now see it. When, in the

past, the surface had a temperature of about 400° F., what is now the water of

the ocean must have existed as water vapour in the atmosphere, which would

-- --thereby as well as because of the presence of other substances be increased in

density and_ volume. Life, as we know it, could not then exist. Again, science
foresees a time when low temperatures, like those produced by Professor Dewar

at the Eoyal Institution, will prevail over the face of the earth. The hydrosphere

and atmosphere will then have disappeared within the rocky crust, or the waters

of the ocean will have become solid rock, and over their surface will roll an ocean

of liquid air about forty feet in depth. Life, as we know it, unless it undergoes

suitable secular modifications, will be extinct. Somewhere between these two

indefinite points of time in the evolution of our planet it is our privilege to live, to

investigate, and to speculate concerning the antecedent and future conditions of

things.

When we regard our globe with the mind's eye, it appears at the present time

to be formed of concentric spheres, very like, and still very unlike, the successive

coats of an onion. Within is situated the vast nucleus or centrosphere surrounding
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and atmosphere, with the included biosphere} To the interaction of these six

geospheres, through enerp'y derived from internal and external sources, may be
referred all the existin;^ superficial phenomena of the planet.

The vast interior of the planetary mass, although not under direct observation,

is known, from the results of the astronomer and physicist, to have h mean density

of 6'6, or twice that of ordinary surface rock. The substances brouglit within the

--reach of observation in veinstones, in lavas, and hypogene rocks by the action
--of water as a solvent and sublimant warrant the belief that the centrosphere is

largely made up of metals and metalloids with imprisoned gases. It is admitted

that the vast nucleus has a very high temperature, but so enormous is the pressure

of the superincumbent crust tliat the melting-point of the substances in the interior

is believed to be raised to a higher value than the temperature there existing

the centrosphere in consequence remains solid, for it may be assumed that the

melting-point of rock-forming materials is raised by increase of pressure. Astro-
nomers from a study of precession and nutation have long been convinced that the
centrosphere must be practically solid.

     Recent seismological observations indicate the transmission of two types of

--waves through the earth the condensational-rarefactional and the purely dis-
--tortional and the study of these tremors supports the view that the centrosphere

is not only solid, but possesses great uniformity of structure. The seismological

investigations of Professors Milne and Knott point also to a fairly abrupt

boundary or transition surface, where the solid nucleus passes into the somewhat

plastic magma on which the firm upper crust rests.

  -- --In this plastic layer or shell named the tektosphere the materials are most

probably in a state of unstable equilibrium and bordering on fusion. Here

the loose-textured solids of the external crust are converted into the denser

solids of the nucleus or into molten masses, at a critical point of temperature and

pressure ; deep-seated rocks may in consequence escape through fissures in the

lithosphere. Within the lithosphere itself the temperature falls off so rapidly
towards the surface as to be everywhere below the melting-point of any substance

there under its particular pressure.

    Now, as the solid centrosphere slowly contracted from loss of heat, the primi-

-- --tive lithosphere, in accommodating itself through changes in the tektosphere to

the shrinking nucleus, would be buckled, warped, and thrown into ridges. That

these movements are still going on is shown by the fact that the lithosphere is

everywhere and at all times in a slight but measurable state of pulsation. The

rigidity of the primitive rocky crust would permit of considerable deformations of
the kind here indicated. Indeed, the compression of mountain chains has most
probably been brought about in this manner, but the same cannot be said of the

elevation of plateaus, of mountain platforms, and of continents.

From many lines of investigation it is concluded, as we have seen, that the

centrosphere is homogeneous in structure. Direct observation, on the other hand,

Howshows that the lithosphere is heterogeneous in composition.    has this hetero-

geneity been brought about ? The original crust was almost certainly composed

of complex and stable silicates, all the silicon dioxide being in combination

with bases. Lord Kelvin has pointed out that, when the solid crust began to

form, it would rapidly cool over its whole surface ; the precipitation of water

would^ accelerate this process, and there would soon be an approximation to present

--conditions. As time went on the plastic or critical layer the tektosphere

immediately beneath the crust would gradually sink deeper and deeper, while

ruptures and re-adjustments would become less and less frequent than in earlier
stages. With the first fall of rain the silicates of the crust would be attacked by
water and carbon dioxide, which can at low temperatures displace silicon dioxide
from its combinations. The silicates, in consequence, have been continuously

robbed of a part, or the whole, of their bases. The silica thus set free goes ulti-

mately to form quartz veins and quartz sand on or about the emerged land, while

the bases leached out of the disintefrratlng rocks are cariied out into the ocean
Aand ocean-basins.
                          continuous disintegration and differentiation of materials of

the lithosphere, accompanied by a sort of migration and selection among mineral

substances, is thus always in progress. Through the agency of life, carbonate of

lime accumulates in one place ; through the agency of winds, quartz sand is heaped

up in another ; through the agency of water, beds of clay, of oxides of iron and

of manganese are spread out in other directions.

The contraction of the centrosphere supplies the force which folds and crumples

the lithosphere. The combined effect of hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere

on the lithosphere gives direction and a determinate mode of action to that force.
From the earliest geological times the most resistent dust of the continents has

been strewn along the marginal belt of the sea-floor skirting the land. At the

present time the deposits over this area contain on the average about 70 per cent, of

free and combined silica, mostly in the form of quartz sand. In the abysmal

deposits far from land there is an average of only about 30 per cent, of silica, and

hardly any of this in the form of quartz sand. Lime, iron, and the other bases largely

predominate in these abysmal regions. The continuous loading on the margins of

the emerged land by deposits tends by increased pressure to keep the materials of

the tektosphere in a solid condition immediately beneath the loaded area. The

unloading of emerged land tends by relief of pressure to produce a viscous

condition of the tektosphere immediately beneath the denuded surfaces. Under

the influence of the continuous shakings, tremors, and tremblings always taking

place in the lithosphere the materials of the tektosphere yield to the stresses acting

on them, and the deep-seated portions of the terrigenous deposits are slowly carried

towards, over, or underneath the emerged land. The rocks subsequently re-formed

beneath continental areas out of these terrigenous materials, under great pressure

and in hydrothermal conditions, would be more acid than the rocks from which

they were originally derived, and it is well known that the acid silicates have a
lower specific gravity than the intermediate or basic ones. By a continual repeti-

tion of this process the continental protuberances have been gradually built up of

lighter materials than the other parts of the lithosphere. The relatively light

quartz, which is also the most refractory, the most stable, and the least fusible

among rock-forming minerals, plays in all this the principal role. The average

height of the surface of the continents is about three miles above the average level

of the abysmal regions. If now we assume the average density of the crust

beneath the continents to be 2'5, and of the part beneath the abysmal regions to

-- --be 3, then the spheroidal surface of equal pressure the tektosphere would have a

minimum depth of eighteen miles beneath the continents and fifteen miles beneath

the oceans, or if we assume the density of the crust beneath the continents to be

2'5, and beneath the abysmal regions to be 2"8, then the tektosphere would be

twenty-eight miles beneath the continents and twenty-five miles beneath the

oceans. The present condition of the earth's crust might be brought about by the

disintegration of a quantity of quartz-free volcanic rock, covering the continental

areas to a depth of eighteen miles, and the re-formation of rocks out of the

disintegrated materials.

Where the lighter and more bulky substances have accumulated there has been

a relative increase of volume, and in consequence bulging has taken place at the

surface over the continental areas. Where the denser materials have been laid

down there has been flattening, and in consequence a depression of the abysmal
regions of the ocean-basins. It is known that, as a general rule, where large

masses of sediment have been deposited, their deposition has been accompanied

by a depression of the area. On the other hand, where broad mountain platforms

have been subjected to extensive erosion, the loss of altitude by denudation has

been made good by a rise of the platform. This points to a movement of matter

on to the continental areas.

If this be anything like a time conception of the interactions that are taking

place between the various geospheres of which our globe is made up, then we can
understand why, in the gradual evolution of the surface features, the average

level of the continental plains new stands permanently about three miles above

the average level of those plains which form the floor of the deep ocean-basins.

We may also understand how the defect of mass under the continents and an

excess of mass under the oceans have been brought about, as well as deficiency of
mass under mountains and excess of mass under plains. Even the local anomalies

indicated by the plumb-line, gravity, and magnetic observations may in this way

--receive a i-ational explanation. It has been urged that an enormous time o-reater

--even than what is demanded by Darwin would be necessary for an evolution of

the existing surface features on these lines. I do not think so. Indeed, in all that

relates to geological time I agree, generally speaking, with the physicists rather
than with the biologists and geologists.

                  Progress of Oceanic Research.

I have now touched on some of the problems and speculations suggested by

recent  deep-sea  explorations                                                           and  there  are  many others,  equally  attractive, to
                                                                                      ;

which no reference has been made. It is abundantly evident that, for the satisfac-

tory explanation of many marine phenomena, further observations and explorations

are necessary. Happily there is no sign that the interest in oceanographical work
has in any way slackened. On the contrary, the number of scientific men and

ships engaged in the study of the ocean is rapidly increasing. Among all civilised

peoples and in all quarters of the globe the economic importance of many of the

problems that await sohition is clearly recognised.

   We have every reason to be proud of the work continually earned on by the

officers and ships attached to the Hydrographic Department of the British Navy.

They have surveyed coasts in all parts of the world for the purposes of navigation,

and within the past few years have greatly enlarged our knowledge of the sea-bed

and deeper waters over wide stretches of the Pacific and other oceans. The

samples of the bottom which are procured, being always carefully preserved by the

officers, have enabled very definite notions to be formed as to the geographical and

bathymetrical distribution of marine deposits.

The ships belonging to_ the various British Telegraph Cable Companies have

done most excellent work in this as well as in other directions. Even during the

present year Mr. E. E. Peake has in the s.s. Britannia procured 477 deep soundings

in the North Atlantic, besides a large collection of deep-sea deposits, and many

deep-sea temperature and current observations.

The French have been extending the valuable work of the Talisman and

Travailleur, while the Prince of Monaco is at the present moment carrying on his

oceanic investigations in the Arctic Seas with a large new yacht elaborately and

specially fitted out for such work. The Russians have recently been engaged in

the scientific exploration of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and a speaal ship

is now employed in the investigation of the Arctic fisheries of the Murman coast

under the direction of Professor Knipowitsch. Admiral Makaroft" has this summer

been hammering his way through Arctic ice, and at the same time carrying on a great

variety of systematic observations and experiments on board the Fermak--the most

powerful and most effective instrument of marine research ever constructed. Mr.

Alexander Agassiz has this year recommenced his deep-sea explorations in the

Pacific on board the U.S. steamer Albatross. He proposes to cross the Pacific in

several directions, and to conduct investigations among the Paumotu and other

coral island groups. Professor Weber is similarly employed on board a Dutch

man-of-war in the East Indian Seas. The Deutsche Seewarte at Hamburg, under

the direction of Dr. Neumayer, continues its praiseworthy assistance and encourage-

ment to all investigators of the ocean, and this year the important German Deep-

sea Expedition, in_ the s.s. F«Mwff, arrived home after most successful oceano-

graphical explorations in the Atlantic, Indian, and Great Southern Oceans.

The Belgica has returned to Europe safely with a wealth of geological and

biological collections and physical observations, after spending, for the first time

on record, a whole winter among the icefields and icebergs of the Antarctic. Mr.

Borchgrevink in December last again penetrated to Cape Adare, successfully landed

his party at that point, and is now wintering on the Antarctic continent. The

expeditions of Lieutenant Peary, of Professor Nathorst, of Captain Sverdrup, and

of the Duke of Abbruzzi, whicli are now in proc;ress, may be expected to yield

much new information about the condition of the Arctic Ocean. Mr. Wellman has

j ust returned from the north of Franz Josef Land, with observations of considerable

interest.

Some of the scientific results obtained by the expeditions in the Danish steamer

Liffolf h&\e lately been published, and these, along with the results of the joint

work pursued for many years by the Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians, may ulti-

mately have great economic value from their direct bearing on Fishery problems,

and on weather forecasting over long periods of time.

Largely through the influence of Professor Otto Pettersson an International

Conference assembled at Stockholm a few months ago, for the purpose of

deliberating as to a programme of conjoint scientific work in the North Sea and

northern parts of the Atlantic, with special reference to the economic aspect of

Asea-fisheries.  programme was successfully drawn up, and an organisation

suggested for carrying it into effect; these proposals are now under the considera-

tion of the several States. The Norwegian Government has voted a large sum of

money for building a special vessel to conduct marine investigations of the nature

recommended by this conference. It is to be hoped the other North Sea Powers

may soon follow this excellent example.

The various marine stations and laboratories for scientific research in all parts

of the world furnish each year much new knowledge concerning the ocean.

Among our own people the excellent work carried on by the Marine Biological

Association, the Irish Fisheries Department, the Scottish Fishery Board, the

Lancashire Fisheries Committee, the Cape and Canadian Fisheries Departments, is

well worthy of recognition and continued support. Mr. George Murray, Mr.

H. N. Dickson, Professor Cleve, Professor Otto Pettersson, Mr. Robert Irvine, and

others have, with the assistance of the officers of the Mercantile Marine, accumu-

lated in recent years a vast amount of information regarding the distribution of

temperature and salinity, as well as of the planktonic organisms at the surface of

the ocean. The papers by Mr. H. C. Russell on the icebergs and currents of the

Great Southern Ocean, and of Mr. F. W. Walker on the density of the water in

the Southern Hemisphere, show that the Australian colonies are taking a practical

interest in oceanographical problems.

                                       Proposed Antarctic Explorations.

     The great event of the year, from a geographical point of view, is the
progress that has been made towards the realisation of a scheme for the
tuorough scientific exploration in the near future of the whole South Polar region.
The British and German Governments have voted or guaranteed large sums of
money to assist in promoting this object, and princely donations have likewise been

W.received from private individuals, in this connection the action of Mr. L.

LongstaS' in making a gift of 25,000^., and of Mr. A. C. Harmsworth in promising
5,000/., being beyond all praise.

     There is an earnest desire among the scientific men of Britain and Germany
that there should be some sort of co-operation with regard to the scientific work
of the two expeditions, and that these should both sail in 1901, so that the invalu-
able gain attaching to simultaneous observations may be secured. Beyond this
nothing has, as yet, been definitely settled. The members of the Association will
presently have an opportunity of expressing their opinions as to what should be
attempted by the British Expedition, how the work in connection with it should
be arranged, and how the various researches in view can best be carried to a

successful issue.

      I have long taken a deep interest in Antarctic exploration, because such explo-
ration must necessarily deal largely with oceanographical problems, and also
because I have had the privilege of studying the conditions of the ocean within
both the Arctic and Antarctic circles. In the year 1886 I published an article on
the subject of Antarctic Exploration in the 'Scottish Geographical Magazine.'

This article led to an interesting interview, especially whep viewed in the light of
                                                                                                                                                                   --

flfter events, for, a few weeks aftev it appeared in type, a young Noi'wen-ian walked

into the Challenf/cr ollice in Edinbuigh to ask when the proposed expedition
would probably start, and if there were any chance of his services being accepted.
His name was Nnnsen.

When at the reque.'^t of the President I addressed the Royal Geographical

Society on the same subject in the year 1893, I made the following statement as
to what it seemed to me should be the general character of the proposed explora-
tion : 'A dash at the South Pole is not, however, what I advocate, nor do I

believe that is what British Science at the present time desires. It demands

rather a steady, continuous, laborious, and systematic exploration of the whole

southern region with all the appliances of the modern investigator.' At the same

time I urged further, that these explorations should be undertaken by the Eoyal

Navy in two ships, and that the work should extend over two winters and three

summers.

    This scheme must now be abandoned, so far at least as the Royal Navy is

concerned, for the Government has intimated that it can spare neither ships nor

--officers, men nor money, for an undertaking of such magnitude. The example of

Foreign Powers rather than the representations from our own scientific men

appears to have been chiefly instrumental in at last inducing the Government to
promise a sum of 45,000/., provided that an equal amount be forthcoming from

other sources. This resolve throws the responsibility for the financial administra-

tion, for the equipment, and for the management of "this exploration, on the repre-

sentative scientific societies, which have no organisation ready for carrving out

important executive work on such an extensive scale. 1 am doubtful whether this

state of matters should be regarded as a sign of increasing lukewarmness on the
part of the Government towards marine research, or should rather be looked on as
a most unexpected and welcome recognition of the growing importance of science

and scientific men to the affairs of the nation. Let us adopt the latter view, and

accept the heavy responsibility attached thereto.

Any one who will take the trouble to read, in the ' Proceedings ' of the Royal

Society of London, the account of the discussion which recently took place on
'The Scientific Advautnges of an Antarctic Expedition,' will gather some idea of
the number and wide range of the subjects which it is urged should be investigated

within the Antarctic area                                                                                                     the proposed researches have to  do with almost every
                                                                                                                           ;

branch of science. Unless an earnest attempt be made to approach very near to

the ideal there sketched out, widespread and lasting disappointment will certainly

be felt among the scientific men of this country. The proposed expedition should

not be one of adventure. Not a rapid invasion and a sudden retreat, with tales of
hardships and risks, but a scientific occupation of the unknown area by observation
and experiment, should be aimed at in these days.

     I have all along estimated the cost of a well-equipped Antarctic Expedition at

about 150,000/. I see no reason for changing my views on this point at the present

time, nor on the general scope of the work to be undertaken by the proposed

expedition, as set forth in the pnpers I have published on the subject. There is

now a sum of at most 90,000/. in hand, or in view. If one ship should be specially

built for penetrating the icy region, and be sent south with one naturalist on bo.ird,

then such an expedition may, it will be granted, bring back interesting and impor-

tant results. But it must be distinctly understood that this is not the kind of

exploration scientific men have been urging on the British public for the past
Wefifteen or twenty years.
                                                                                                                              must, if possible, have two ships, with landing parties

for stations on shore, and with a recognised scientific leader and staff on board

of each ship. Although we cannot have the Royal Navy, these ships can be most

efficiently officered and manned from the Mercantile Marine. With only one ship
many of the proposed observations would have to be cut out of the programme.

In anticipation of this being the case, there are at the present moment irrecon-

cilable difl'erences of opinion among those most interested in these exidoratious, as
to which sciences must be sacrificed.

The difficulties which at present surround this undertaking are fundamentallv

those of money. These difficulties would at once disappear, and ethers would

certainly be orercome, should the members of the British Association at this
meeting agree to place in the hands of their President a sum of 50,000/., so that the
total amount available for Antarctic exploration would become something like
150,000/. Although there is but one central Government, surely there are within
the bound.': of this great Empire two more men like Mr. Longstail'. The Government
has suddenly placed the burden of upholding the high traditions of Great Britain
in marine research and exploration on the shoulders of her scientific men. In
their name I appeal to all our well-to-do fellow-countrymen in every walk of life

for assistance, so that these new duties may be discharged in a manner worthy of

the Empire and of the well-earned reputation of British Science.

    The following Papers and Eeport were read :--

                1. On Polar Exploration by means of Icebreakers.
                By Admiral Makaroff, Imiwrial Russian Navy.

     The steel steamer Zennah, of 8,000 tons displacement, was specially built for
use as an icebreaker for keeping open the route to Baltic ports in winter and
through the Kara Sea in summer. The trial trip of the vessel to the Arctic ice
north of Spitzbergen was described, and its advantages of strength, speed, and
comfort over all previous exploring vessels were explained.

      2. Physical Observations in the Barents Sea. By W. S. Bruce.

3. Report of the Committee on African Climatology, See Keports, p. 448.

                 4. Seismology in relation to the Interior of the Earth.

                               By John Milne, F.R.S.

     After the blow or blows have been struck which cause an earthquake a flood
of motion sets out in all directions over the surface of the earth, and in all direc-
tions through its interior. That which passes over the surface does so in waves
which, whilst travelling at a fairly constant velocity, increase in amplitude and
period. The waves which pass through the interior travel swifter and swifter the
nearer their path is to a diameter. At a distant station the first motion recorded
is that which has travelled through the earth, and the last that which has travelled
round its surface. Intermediate motion would be that which had passed through
the earth and then completed its journey to the observing station through the
surface. Observation shows that the average velocity with which waves pass
through the earth varies with the square root of the average depth of the paths

they follow. Coupling this observation with the knowledge we possess respect-

ing the density of our world as a whole and the density of the materials on its
surface, Dr. C. G. Knott shows that the elasticity which governs the transmission
of the precursors of the real earthquake increases at a rate of about 1 per cent, for
every mile of descent.

     The second section of the paper treated of the motion following the
originating blows of an earthquake. It was a common observation to find
that large earthquakes are a few minutes later followed by other violent disturb-
ances, and because these second shocks had characteristics similar to the first ones
they might be regarded as ' echoes.' Such symmetrical repetitions, which were
illustrated by seismograms, indicate that we were not dealing with irregular
adjustment of fractured materials, but with phenomena analogous to musical rever-

berations.

                            FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15.

     The following Papers and Report were read :

  1. On the Voyaqe of the ' Southern Cross ^ from Hohart to Cape Adare.
                    By Hugh Robert Mill, D.Sc, F.R.S.E.

    By permission of Sir George Newnea tlie pai'ticulars of the voyage of his Polar

yacht Southern Cross from Tasmania to Cape Adare conveying the Antarctic

expedition under the command of Mr. Borchgrevink were laid before the Section.
     The Southern Cross left the Thames on August 24, 1898, and Ilobart on De-

cember 19, reached the first ice on December 30 in 61° 56' S. and 159° E., and

entered the heavy pack on January 1, 1899. She worked her way slowly to

66° 46' S. on January 31, then turned northward, got clear of the pack, "and entered
it again farther east on February 13, and passed through easily, anchorino- oif the
beach near Cape Adare on February 17. In spite of heavy storms the whole party
was safely landed with their stores, and the ship left for the north on February 28.

2. The Problem of Antarctic Ex^jloration. By Henryk Arctowski.

The question of Antarctic exploration is now before the scientific world, and it

must be answered in such a manner that the results of the voyages of exploration

Amay be in accordance with modern requirements.  great step in our knowledge

of the physical conditions of the globe is about to be made.

     I would insist, in the first place, that it is necessary to aim not only at the
discovery of new lands and the observation of their configuration. The geology

of these lands must be studied, and also the glaciers and the condition of the sea-

ice which surround them. The various physical and natural sciences have then to

be considered, taking account of magnetic and meteorological conditions, fauna,

flora, &c. All these, however, concern only one side of the question, for in the

--southern hemisphere not only are the Antarctic lands continent or islands

totally unknown, but also a very large part of the three great neighbouring

oceans. At the present day it is impossible to consider the land alone ; the whole
Antarctic area exhibits phenomena which remain very imperfectly known. I refer

specially to the great questions of atmospheric circulation, climate, circumpolar

oceanography, and magnetic conditions.

Hence Antarctic explorations must be conducted in three ways :

   A1. system of fixed stations arranged between the edge of the continents and

the zone of ice. These stations should be supplied with all necessary magnetic
and meteorological instruments, and continue at work simultaneously for one year

at least.

     2. During the same year two polar expeditions should set out on opposite sides
towards the South Pole. This would require two vessels strong enough to with-
stand the pack and equipped for wintering.

     3. Finally a circumpolar expedition, planned to follow the edge of the pack
right round, and specially equipped for oceanographical and zoological work.
This expedition would also survey the accessible parts of the Antarctic coast.

Such a system of exploration must necessarily be the work of several nations.

Weyprecht's idea should be revived and followed. Antarctic exploration must be

Aconducted systematically, and it ought to be international.  series of circumpolar

stations, where comparable and simultaneous observations are carried on, would
make the results of the British and German Antarctic expeditions remarkably
complete, and vastly enhance their value.

     I should suggest the following arrangement of stations.

   A polygon of stations should unite South America and the Antarctic lands.

The path of the cyclonic storms passes to the south of Cape Horn, and--at least
during part of the year--to the north of Palmer Land. The polygon should

include stations on the east and west coasts of Graham Land, and one of the South

                                                                3F2
                                                                   --

Shetland Islands, on SoiitL. Orkney and on one of the Sandwich Islands, togetlier
with stations at Cape Pillar, Cape Virgins, Cape Horn, Staten Island and the
Falklands. With such a system of observations it would be possible to determine
exactly the track of every cyclone crossing the polygon of stations. This is a
matter of very great practical importance. These cyclones seem to travel in the
general direction of the upper winds from west to east, and to follow the outline of

Alexander, Graham, and Palmer Lands, but how and why this is so we cannot tell

as yet. Between South America and the Antarctic land there is a belt of low
pressure which seems to encircle the Antarctic region where there is apparently a
permanent anticyclone ; but observations are wanting to determine the associated
conditions of atmospheric circulation.

     It seems scarcely necessary to insist on the advantages which two other
polygons of stations would offer, one to the south of the Indian Ocean, the other

between New Zealand and Victoria Land. The second polygon would be formed

by the islands of Prince Edward, Crozet, Kerguelen, and a station on Enderby
Land. The third polygon would include the Balleny, Macquarie, and Auckland
Islands. This would be a particularly interesting polygon on account of its
comparative proximity to the magnetic pole.

     The two vessels designed to winter in the pack should approach along the

meridians of 145° W. and 35° E. Imprisoned in the pack, as the Belgica was,

these vessels would be able to carry on oceanographical and zoological work, and
also to collect magnetic and meteorological observations, thus adding two stations

near the pole to the various polygons. From the meteorological point of view it

would be extremely interesting for these vessels to reach high latitudes, for the
region near the pole will probably differ greatly from the northern edge of the
Antarctic lands in everything regarding atmospheric pressure, wind, and storms.

    As to the circumpolar expeditions I think that the vessel intended for this
purpose should be quite independent of those which penetrate the pack. The

region is too great to admit of the whole voyage being completed in one season
three would probably be necessary. It is not easy to indicate the route which

should be followed, for everything depends on circumstances. Still it may be

-- --observed that in summer at least easterly winds predominate near the edge of

the south polar pack, and therefore it would be advantageous to proceed from east

to west.

     Leaving the River Plate in September the vessel might commence work at the
South Shetlands at the beginning of October. The months from November to

March might be occupied in the voyage from 60° W. to 150° W. along the pack,
and thence a passage might be made to Melbourne. The following summer the

extreme south of the Indian Ocean might occupy the vessel, and a third season
might be devoted to the Antarctic Atlantic.

     This programme is doubtless but a dream. I often wished, on board the

Belgica, that I dared to propose it as a programme, because it seemed to me
perfectly realisable. One may perhaps speak of it at the dawn of a new century.

3. Notes on the Physical and Chemical Work of an Antarctic Expedition.

                             By J. Y. Buchanan, F.R.S.

     In an Antarctic Expedition, the physical and chemical work to be done falls
into two classes, according as it has to be done at sea or on land.

     The principal object at the outset of the expedition should be to push energeti-
cally southwards, and effect a landing in the most suitable place in the highest
possible southern latitude, and there establish the principal station. The locality
should be chosen where the ship, or one of the ships, would find safe winter

quarters.

     As the principal object is to establish the expedition as advantageously as

possible on land, no time should be spent unnecessarily at sea. For this reason
magnetic observations at eea should not be contemplated. They take up an
              TRA>'SACT10NS OF SECTION E.  805

enornious amount of time, and besides, if they are to he of any use, the distribu-

tion of iron in the ship has to be arranged nuder such restrictions as to interfere

materially with the usefulness of the ship in other directions. On land the
magnetic observations would occupy a first place, also pendulum observations

lor the determination of the intensity of gravity and tidal observations.
     It has been the general experience of Antarctic navigators that the heavy

pack ice is met with at a considerable distance from land, and between it and the
land there is comparatively open water The ice which would cover this water in
winter would probably loosen earlier than the heavy pack, and the ship, if winter-
ing inside, might be able to move much earlier than it would be pos-ible for her

to pass the pack ; and this would be an additional advantage of finding winter

quarters for the ship.

     Perhaps the most important work to be done is to obtain a complete meteoro-

lugical record during the whole of the sojourn of the expedition in Antarctic

regions, whether at sea or on land. At present, any view as to the meteorological
conditions on the Antarctic land may be held, because we have no facts by which

to regulate our speculations. The expedition should be fully supplied with instru-

ments for this purpose, and especially with self-recording instruments.
     As the station must necessarily be on land, and not on ice, geological observa-

tions will be made as a matter of course.

    What distinguishes the Antarctic regions above everything is the development

of ice as a geological feature, whether it is met with at sea fis icebergs, or on land
as glaciers, or a continuous covering. It is almost certain that any station on
land will be within easy reach of a glacier, and means should be taken to establish

marks as early as possible which will enable its motion to be observed before
darkness sets in and after the sun reappears. The Greenland glaciers appear to

move about three times as fast as the Swiss ones. Do the Antarctic ones move

faster still? In Spitzbergen the glacier streams sometimes take very large pro-

Howportions.  does it stand with the Antarctic ones in this respect ? The

'grain' of the Spitzbergen glaciers does not seem to be larger than that of the
principal Swiss glaciers. The Antarctic land ice must be dissected with a view to

the determination of the size and the articulation of the grain. It is, therefore, of
the first importance that the chemist and physicist should have spent some time
both in summer and in winter examining for himself the conditions of one of the

Swiss glaciers. This is quite as necessary for him as having spent a certain time

in a chemical or a physical laboratory.

    The ordinary work of a chemist and physicist at sea is now so well understood
that it is hardly necessary to say much on it. The temperature and density of
the surface water are observed at stated intervals. Whenever it is possible the

temperature of the water at the bottom and at intermediate depths is observed

and samples obtained. The gases dissolved in the water at the surface, at the

bottom, and at intermediate depths, should be boiled out and preserved for analysis
as often as possible. The proportion of oxygen to nitrogen in the gas gives an

idea of the extent to which the dissolved atmosphere has been used, or of the

amount of animal life which It has supported.
     The apparatus for use on deck and in the laboratory is so various, and has been

80 often described, that little more remains to be said about it than that most

observers prefer their own apparatus.

With regard to the district which would fall to the English expedition to

explore, I should welcome an arrangement which would enable it to follow to its

Antarctic source the remarkable stream of very cold water which the Challenr/er

found flowing at the bottom of the depression which runs along the eastern coast
of South America from the River Plate to the equator. This work would also

carry the expedition in the direction of Weddell's highest latitude, and of Ross's

deepest sounding. The base of the English expedition would then be the

Falkland Islands.

    Much more might be said about the work which a chemist and physicist may

find to do under various circumstances ; but it is to be assumed that whoever is

{ippoiflted will Jinow his busijiesg. His principal duty, ijj a new region like the
806 REPORT--1899.

Antarctic, will be to keep his science and his art handy to be turned to good
account whenever the occasion may arise.

6. Travels in East Bokhara. By Mrs. W. Rickmer Rickmers.

Accompanied by Mr. Rickmers and Dr. v. Kraift, I left the ancient capital of

Bokhara in June, 1898. The object of the journey was the exploration of some of

the little-known parts of the eastern provinces of the Khanate. After a two-weeks'

ride on horseback through steppe and loess, the mountains of the province of

Baljuan were reached.

    We lived for tive months among the conglomerate mountains of the Yakh-Su

Valley. This region is extremely wild and fantastic, reminding one at the same

time of the Dolomites and the ' Bad Lands,' with their dark and deep canons. The

natives, who speak a Persian dialect, extract gold from the alluvial deposits in these

valleys. I'heir method is very primitive, and yields them a precarious livelihood,

but experiments conducted on a large scale have shown that modern processes must

assuie big profits to enterprisiug pioneers. The stones composing the conglomerate

are mostly crystalline, and the whole formation, which is in places 4,00U ft. thick,

is ascribed by Dr. v. Kraft't to the tertiary period. The highest summit, a towering

Acupola, is 13,000 ft. high, and was several times climbed.      glacier of the second

order comes down on one aide, and is curious for having a moraine composed of

rounded fragments, which, of course, could not be otherwise, seeing that the moun-

tain is entirely composed of conglomerate. Mr. Kickmers and Dr. v. KrafFt, after

several attempts, succeeded in making the first ascent of the Kuch-Manar, a jagged

peak 12,000 ft. in height. The views obtained from these points were most beau-

tiful and instructive ; towards the east one beheld an ocean of snow and ice,

bounded by the Pamir and the Alai, whereas towards the west the ground

sloped down to the immense Transcaspian plain.

Much time was devoted to the examination of phenomena new to the

literature of physical geography. These were the ' Barriers of the Dandushka,'

which are remarkable for having been formed by hydrodynamic agencies, and for

having subsequently been pierced by a canon, likewise formed by water. Vegetable

and animal life was not abundant. Thin woods are only to be found in some of

the more .secluded valleys, where the natives rarely penetrate.

Excursions into the surrounding provinces were also made. Dr. v. Krafi't

visited Darwaz, and brought back valuable geological information. Mr. Rickmers

and I went to Kulab, and thence to the Afghan frontier, where we spent several

days among the jungles of the Oxus.

The return journey was via Baljuan, Karatagh, Baissnu, and Kitab to Samai'-

kand. From Samarkand an interesting lake, the Timur-Dera-Kul, situated at a

great height among the mountains, was visited.

     7. A Journey in Western Oaxaca, Mexico. By O. H. Howarth.

     The exploration of a portion of the State of Oaxaca, lying south and west
between the capital city and the sea, became necessary in the latter part of last
year, with a view to ascertain a possible route between the valley of Rio Minas, on
the upper course of the Peiioles river, and a point on the Southern Railway,
          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                           807

without traversing the high mountain ridges extending between that valley and

the city, on a direct line. The whole region is mountainous, being an expansion

of the parallel main ranges of the Western Sierra Madre continued through the

States of Guerrero and Oaxaca as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The

ridges, though approximately parallel, are of somewhat irregular conformation.

They rise generally to an altitude of between 8,000 and 9,000 feet, being inter-

sected by valleys of generally greater breadth than the canons of the same range

further north ; these valleys, however, descending to levels of from 3,000 to 4,000

feet, and of course to still lower elevations as the ranges approach the Pacific

Coast. The ranges are largely covered with varied foliage, and the prospect from

any of the high ridges is of great magnificence.

On leaving the city of Oaxaca in a westerly direction an open rolling country,

partly bare of vegetation, is traversed for a distance of nine or ten miles to the

Afoothills of the nearest range, crossing the river Atoyac close to the city.  pro-

minent object in the centre of this tract is the white dome of the unfinished

monastery of Cuilapa, a remarkable structure of high architectural interest raised

by Cortez during his occupation of the country, and said to have also comprised a

residence for the Princess Malintzi or Malinche. The evidence of this is, however,
doubtful, and may possibly have been based on the existence in one of the tran-

septs of a massive inscribed gravestone on which the name of Cortez appears.

Entering the range by the winding caiion of Zavaleta a gradual ascent is made to

a summit clothed with pine forests, where natural ice is prepared and stored on a

singular native system. The trail issues above the little mountain village of San

Pablo Cuatro Yenados, or St. Paul of the Four Deer, one of the most remarkable

sites of early settlement in Mexico. Following the ridge another descent com-

mences through a heavily timbered caiion to the mining village of San Miguel
APeras, some fifteen miles further.
                                     mile beyond this is the meeting of two forks

of the Rio Verde, and the usual uncertain nomenclature as to rivers and other

Alocal features is encountered.  second ascent to 9,000 feet has then to be accom-

plished by exceedingly rough trails, succeeded by a descent into a valley of less

depth, but falling gradually to the north and south of the point of crossing. On

reascending from this, a summit is reached crowned by a native village known as

Huitepec, occupied by a population of Indians whose language proved to be entirely

distinct from any of the known dialects of the State, and apparently isolated. It

possesses several peculiarities, and seems to be a solitary survival of one of the most

ancient tongues of Central America.

Immediately beyond this the geological formation changes suddenly, the next

descent being entirely covered with vast irregular boulders of grey limestone,

amongst which the threading of a trail with horses and pack-mules is a matter of

extreme difficulty. Again a high ridge has to be traversed at an altitude equal to

the previous ones, amongst alternations of pine and scrub-oak growth and open

spaces of a long fine grass, with a variety of fl^owering plants. At some six or

seven miles beyond Huitepec the trail enters the head of an extremely steep canon,

the side of which it skirts with an available width of sometimes not more than a

foot or eighteen inches, this track being known as the Infiernillo or ' Little Infernal,'
a name which the traveller by it considers by no means inappropriate, especially

in the season of rains, when the clayey surface becomes slippery with moisture.

Finally, the trail leads out upon a fourth ridge, overlooking the attractive

valley of Kio Minas, with its winding river, a last descent being now made to a

level of 4,200 feet. The few inhabitants of this country, a delightful one both in

climate and fertility, are of a simple and hospitable disposition, and engaged, so

far as they follow any pursuit at all, entirely in agricultural occupations, though

surrounded by rich mineral formations. The general absence of animal life is

noticeable, though the valleys abound with butterflies and other insects. Poisonous

insects of all kinds, and also snakes, appear to be very rare ; in fact, almost

unknown.

The difficulty of access from the well-populated valley of Oaxaca has no doubt

contributed to the isolation of a district so inviting. Further down the course of

the Penoles river, where it jsgues westward, the valley divides to the north-west
                             --

and soutk-east, and without any great change of elevation in the former direction
trends towards the district capital of Nochistlan at a distance of about thirty-five
miles, and thence in an easterly course towards the line of the Southern Railway
at Parian, some thirty miles north of the city of Oaxaca. This latter approach
has a ^ood road, which, prior to the existence of the railway, would merely have

led into the mountaios again. It may be expected, however, that slow as the

Mexicans are to recognise or avail themselves of any advantages of communication,

the better access from the north to these productive valleys may gradually lead to
their occupation and development, when further explored under European auspices.

     The climatic conditions are similar to those of all the southern interior of
Mexico, though, owing to the intersection of the country by long and lofty ridges,
the rainfall during the wet season is somev/hat greater. The journey here described
was undertaljen during the month of Deoember last, when the atmospheric condi-
tions are perhaps unrivalled in the world as to temperature and salubrity.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 16,

The following Papers were read :

1. Oceanograplbical and Meteorological Results of the German Deep-sea

          Ex2)edition in the ' Valdivia.' By Dr. Gerhard Schott.

The voyage of the Valdivia was undertaken at the cost of the Imperial German

Government, and may be generally described as a circumnavigation of Africa,

although the route involved some wide sweeps away from that continent. From

Capetown the route led southward into the Antarctic Ocean until the ice-pack

forbade further progress ; then along the edge of the ice from 0° to 60° East longi-

tude, then north to Kerguelen. The two main geographical results of the cruise

were the rediscovery of Bouvet Island, and the sounding of the whole of the tropical

Indian Ocean for the first time.

The oceanographical work included a large number of deep-sea soundings. The

Valdivia was provided with two sounding machines. The Sigsbee machine Avorked

remarkably well even in very stormy weather. The introduction of an electro-

motor for reeling in the line was a novelty that turned out most satisfactory ; it is

especially to be commended for Polar work in which steam pipes are apt to freeze.

The best results of the sounding work were on the southern part of the cruise,

from Capetown to Bouvet Island, thence along the edge of the ice to the vicinity

of Enderby Land, and thence to Kerguelen, because the ship was then in waters

which had rarely been visited, and because of the discovery of remarkably great

depths of 2,800 to 3,000 fathoms, in place of the supposed Antarctic plateau.

Many details of the form of the ocean-bed were also studied, as, for example, the

enclosed seas between the west of Sumatra and the Nias Islands, the steep sub-

marine slope from Sumatra to the Indian Ocean, the connection of the Ohagos

Islands with the Maldives, and the slope of the Agulhas bank to the deep sea.

WeThe measurement of deep-sea temperature came next in importance.             can

only refer here to the results obtained in the tropical Indian Ocean and on the

margin of the ice. In the first-named instance an extraordinarily rapid transition

between the temperature of the superficial layer heated by the sun and the deeper

mass of cold water was observed, forming a sort of Sprungschicht between the

depths of 50 and 100 fathoms. On the border of the ice the distribution of tem-

perature was a cold layer on the surface, produced by the melting of ice with a

temperature of from 29° to S0° F. ; below 50 fathoms warmer and aalter water (the

temperature rising from 32° to 35° F.), and below that to nearly 1,000 fathoms a

steadily falling temperature. The larger icebergs all dip into the warmer layer.

This arrangement of temperature is not identical with that found in the Antarctic

by the Challenf/er, although similar to it.

diatiugiiisbing tlie floatiiifj ice into three categories : (1) Drift-ice, low broken
blocks, often evidently broken-off parts of glaciers; (2) P«c/c-/ce, composed of
greenish stratified masses of frozen sea-water; and (3) Icebergs. The icebergs
observed in the western part of the Valdivia's route, i.e. in the neighbourhood of
Bouvet Island, were much water-woru and varied in outline, having evidently
been afloat for a long time, while in the eastern part, near Enderby Land, they
were fresh, tabular, and regular in form, and had a height of from 100 to 180 feet

above the surface.

     Amongst the meteorological work that accomplished in the far south can alone
be mentioned. The expedition saw nothing of the ' brave west winds 'south of
5.5° S., but only light winds (though often storms) from E., N.E., and N., with
frequent calms and a quiet sea with fog on many occasions. In spite of the
frequency of east winds the barometer showed no sign of rising towards the south,
as the existence of an Antarctic anticyclone would seem to imply, but fell steadily.

On the Mean Temperature of the Surface Waters of the Sea round the
British Coasts, and its Relation to that of the Air. By H. N.

Dickson,^) F.R.S.E.

The mean monthly and annual temperatures of the surface waters of the sea

during the period 18S0-97 are shown for sixty-five stations distributed round the

coasts of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The average for the year at the entrance
to the English Channel is nearly 54° F., it falls as the Channel narrows to 52°

between the Start and Cape la Hague, and remains steady to beyond the

Straits of Dover, at least as far as the East Goodwin light vessel. On the south-

west coast of Ireland the annual mean is about 59°, falling to 51° in St. George's

AChannel, and 50° in the Irish Sea.  slow fall from 52° to 50° takes place on the

west coast of Ireland until the N.W. corner is reached. The mean of 49° per-

sists along the north coast of Ireland to the North Channel, and along the whole

of the west coast of Scotland to Stornoway. On the east coast temperature falls
very quickly, as soon as we get out of range of the Straits of Dover, to 50° off
Suffolk and Norfolk, and then there is a gradual fall as we go northwards, to 48°

off the coast of Northumberland, 47 j° off' Aberdeenshire, and 47° at the Orkneys

and Shetlands. The effect of the tidal streams in mixing the waters is exceedingly
well marked. The annual minimum of temperature rarely occurs in March, most

frequently in January, especially at stations open to the Atlantic. The annual
maximum occurs almost everywhere in August.

Mean temperatures of the surface water are compared with the forty-year

Aaverages for the air, recently published by Buchan.  comparison shows that the

mean annual difference has hitherto been somewhat over-estimated, especially on

the western coast ; in no case is the mean excess of sea over air greater than 2° F.
The maximum difference occurs everywhere in November and December, and is

greatest on the south coast of England between Portland Bill and the Straits of

Dover.

        4. On the Terminology of the Forms of Suboceanic Relief.
                 By Hugh Robert Mill, D.Sc, F.R.S.E.

     The Royal Geographical Society is at present engaged in the investigation of
the whole great subject of the terminology of geography, and at the approaching

International Geographical Congress at Berlin the question of the terminology

and nomenclature of the forms of the floor of the ocean is to be discussed by
representatives of different countries. The fact that the forms of the ocean floor
cannot be seen, but only felt out by soundings, makes their study one of peculiar
difliculty. Some distinguished authorities believe that our present knowledge of
the deep sea is too slight to justify any systematic nomenclature. Meanwhile

each investigator introduces a set of names of his own, for the most part based on

analogies with land forms visible to the eye.

It is obvious that there are two great classes of forms, elevations above and

depressions below the general level of the ocean floor ; but the question is how
many subdivisions of each can be recognised as distinctive and deserving of generic
names. I am inclined to put forward tentatively the following general scheme of

terminology, premising that no attempt be made to localise any precise type of

--form unless a considerable number of soundings exists to deflne it :

--Depression. The general term for any sub-oceanic hollow.
--ABasin.
           relatively wide depression, with comparatively gently sloping sides.
--ACaldron.
             relatively wide depression, with comparatively steeply sloping

sides.
--AFurrow.
             relatively narrow depression with comparatively gently sloping

sides.
--ATrough.
             relatively narrow depression with comparatively steeply sloping

sides.
--Wall. Any submarine slope comparable in steepness to a precipice on land.
--Floor. Any very gentle submarine slope or nearly level surface.
--Elevation. Any inequality above the general level of the ocean floor.
--ARise.
--ABank.  relatively narrow elevation.

           relatively wide elevation.
--Shoal. An elevation coming within five fathoms of the surface, so as to be a

--Adanger to shipping.
Shelf.     nearly horizontal bank attached to the land and bordered seaward

by a much more abrupt downward slope.

    Any suggestions as to the forms which are really typical and the terms which

ere most appropriate for their designation will be carefully considered.

                                       5. Tioelve Years' Work of the Ordnance Survey.

                                           By Colonel Sir John Farquhakson, K.C.B.

In October 1887 I was ordered to take up at Southampton, where the head-

quarters of the Survey are established, the duties of Executive Officer, or second in

command, of the Ordnance Survey. Sir Charles Wilson was then Director-

General and in March 1894 I succeeded him in the latter position, which I
                                      ;

retained until March of this year, when, on the expiry of my five years' term of

office, I handed over the duties to Colonel Duncan A. Johnston, R.E., the present

Director-General. I propose in this paper to give a short summary of the work

done by the Ordnance Survey Department in the period of nearly twelve years,

from October 1887 to March 1899, during which I was either Executive Officer or

Director-General, and during which, in one or other of those capacities, the whole

of the work of the Survey passed through my hands.

During those twelve years there have been probably more changes made in the

character of the work done by the Survey than in any other equal period of its

history                                and, as regards the areas covered by its operations, they have  been largely
                                    ;

in excess of the areas covered during any previous equal period. This is, of course,

due to the fact that Revisions have now largely taken the place of original Surveys.

I propose first to deal with the progress made, from 1887 to 1899, in the

following branches of the work

The progress (to completion in 1890) of the original Cadastral Survey of Eng-

land and Wales, including the (3-inch surveys of uncultivated districts.

The progress made on Re-surveys for the larger scales of various counties of

England and Scotland which had been originally surveyed for the 6-inch scale

only ; and the progress made on the Revision of the original Cadastral Surveys of

England and Scotland, whether on the 2o-inch or 6-inch scale.

The progress made on the Re-survey of Ireland tor the ^s^tr or 2.5-inch scale.
The progress made on the completion of the original new series engraved 1-inch

maps of Great Britain and Ireland, both in outline and with hills.

The progress made ou the Revision of the new series 1-inch engraved outline

maps of Great Britain and Ireland, and the commencement of the issue for Scotland

and the North of England (and for Ireland ultimately) of the same revised 1-inch

map with hills in brown by double printing.

The progress made with coloured 1-inch maps of the South of England.

The progress made with maps on scales smaller than 1 inch to a mile.

The simplest, and probably the clearest method of showing the work done under

the above heads will be by diagrams, which have been prepared.

   A short account is given of the nature, causes, and results of any changes

made since 1887 in the system of carrying out the Survey, some of which may be

due to the reports of Committees, or suggestions frona the general public, while

others have been necessitated by the changes which have taken place in the cha-

racter of the work done by the Department.

Observations are made as to the style and quality of the maps on all scales,

both old and new. But as specimens of these maps are provided for inspection

by members of the Association, these observations are very brief. Specimens of

foreign maps, so far as available, are also provided for inspection by members, and

comparison with the English maps.

The Ordnance Survey Department, in 1887, published town maps at the cost of

the State, on the scales of 10 feet (^Jg) and 5 feet (xTjVir) to a mile.                               It does so
no longer.

The sales of the Ordnance Survey maps were in 1887 in the hands of the

Stationery Office : they are now in the hands of the Ordnance Survey Department

itself.

     Some remarks are also made as to the organisation and superintendence of
the Department and of its work ; as to the use or otherwise made of the Ordnance
Survey maps by other departments of the State and by the public generally ; and
as to the importaut work which still remains to be done by the Ordnance Survey,

6. On Sand-Dunes bordering the Delta of the Nile.
  By Vaughan Cornish, M.Sc, F.R.G.H., F.C.S.

     The autbor visited Egypt in April-May, 1899, in continuation of his woik
upon Sand-dunes (see ' Geographical Journal,' March 1897, the first of a series of
papers upon ' Kuinatology '). Obsei'vations of sand-dunes and allied phenomena
were made upon twenty-three days along the line of the Suez Canal between Port
Said and Serapeum, on the Syrian route I'rom Kantara, in the neighbourhood of

Ismailia, and on the line from Ismailia to Abu Hammad, between Cairo and
Terieh, on the western margin of the Delta, and in the neighbourhood of Helwan

and Sakara. About fifty photographs and eight drawings, suitable for reproduc-
tion, were obtained of sand-dunes, wind-erosion structures, and of tree-planting
directed against the encroachment of sand. The photographs of dunes include
both Barchanes (or Medanos) and the curious hollows which, in Arabia, are called
Fuljes, as well as gently undulating surfaces, covering the country like a mantle
of snow, with no sharp ridge or slipping lee cliff. Measurements of ripples and
dunes were made, and samples of sand were taken, from which (two only at

--present) micro-photographs have been prepared.
     Hippies. The author had previously measured twelve wind-formed ripples in
the blown sea sand on the Dorset coast. The average ratio of length to height

was- - = 18'4. The least height was -06 inch, and the greatest -34 inch. These

measurements were, for the most part, of one or two individual ripples. Mr. E.
A. Floyer measured si.i: of the largest kind of ripples on the El Arish route, and

Hobtained -^ = 17-7 with   from G to 10-6 inches. The author measured thirty-

seven consecutioe ripples to leeward of a sand-dune near Ismailia. The ripples

Hhad an average height of 1'43 inches, and the average was 16 57. The appear-

ance of these was intermediate between that of ripples where accumulation is rapid

(which never grow large), and the large and nearly symmetrical ripples (? analogous

to sastrugi), as much as 11 feet in wave-length, the formation of which is

apparently accompanied by a considerable lowering of the general level.
--ALunes.
           tract of a few hundred acres of small, but true, dunes (not ripples)

on a sandy foreland, exposed during the fall of the Is'ile, allbrded an opportunity

for similar measurements.

     Higher and lower dunes succeeded one another, and viewed transversely, the
ridges were strongly undulating. Nevertheless, a line having been marked out in

--the up-and-down-wind direction, the average for twenty-four coneecutive dunes

was found to be 18'04, average height 20 inches. Another set of measurements

^taken near the same line on the succeeding day, gave = 17'89 for twenty-three

Hconsecutive dunes. Apparently the ridges are formed of the nearly uniform (-- = 18)

shape, and lateral inequalities are subsequently developed in the manner explained
in the ' Geographical Journal,' June 1898, pp. 637-9, but these do not aflect the

average .. The author hopes to make similar measurements of trains of larger

dunes.

     The straight, slipping lee cliff of dunes is caused by the undercutting of the
eddy. In the dunes near Ismailia a progressive development of the profile form
was observed. At first both windward and lee slopes are very gentle, and the
highest point is near the middle. The summit apparently moves to leeward, and the
lee slope becomes steeper ; a slipping cliff' is foimed on the upper part of the lee
slope. This pushes back towards the summit, and the windward slope grows
steeper. Finally, windward and average leeward slope become of nearly equal
steepness, and the top of the clifF coincides -witlj the summit of tl^e 4viDg.

  --t)nnfi Tracts. The condition for formation of a dune tract ill .1 sandy district

is that the rate of travel of the sand should be locally diminished without a cox-re-

sponding diminution in the supply of sand. The persistence of such condition may

cause a stationary dune massif without fixation.
     In the sandy district visited by the author the formation of a dune tract or

dune massif appears to be chiefly determined by the presence of ground moisture,
which gives coherence to the sand. Thus the boundaries of these massifs frequently
appear inexplicable when an explanation is sought in the wind. Within the
bounds of the massif, however, the modelling of the surface is explicable by the

action of the winds.

               and Sarawak. By A. C. Haddon, B.Sc, F.R.S.

           2. A Visit to the Karch-Chal Mountains, Transcaucasia.
                           By W. RiCKMEB RiCKMEUS.

     In the summer of 1895, accompanied by Dr. A. Hacker, of Vienna, I visited the
Karch-Ohal Mountains, in Transcaucasia. This group is S.E. of Batum, and, in a
straight line, about 30 miles distant from that port. The route taken was along

the Chorokh River, through a well-wooded valley rich in copper ore. A carriage

road can be used as far as the village Borchkha, where one leaves the river and
ascends by one of the side valleys. These are fairly well cultivated, containing
numerous villages inhabited by Ajars or Lazes, a people speaking a dialect pro-
duced by the mixture of Georgian and Osmanli. They were originally Georgian
Christians, and ruined churches can be found in several places, even at a height of

4,000 ft. Now the country is thoroughly Mohammedanised. Maize and tobacco

are the chief produce.

     After leaving the region of the picturesquely situated villages, with their brown
wooden houses, the ascent leads through a forest of magnificent beeches and other

leaf-trees. In the midst of this luxuriant vegetation, at a height of 5,000 ft., a hot
spring has given birth to a primitive watering-place called Otingo, consisting of

three oheds, and chiefly frequented by Armenians from Artwin. Above this comes
a zone of dense fir-woods, with an impenetrable undergrowth of laurel and rhodo-
dendron, the abode of numerous bears. At a level of ca. 7,000 ft. one steps forth
on to the undulating Alpine pastures where the cattle are sent to graze during two
summer months. The Yailas, corresponding to the Se7i7ihutten of the Alps, are
almost exactly like their European counterparts. In one of the huts we lived for

many weeks, save when, for a change, we passed the nights in a cave 3,000 ft.

higher or on the summit of a mountain.
      Tlie principal peaks of the group are on an average 12,000 ft. high, and sur-

round a plateau about 11,000 ft. high. Eight peaks were climbed, some proving
fairly dillicult. Photographs were taken, and a collection of Alpine plants made,
which has thrown light on the mountain flora of these regions. Large mammals,
such as ibex or chamois, were not observed, but eagles and vultures were plentiful.

      Three days and nights were spent on the top of the highest summits in ord-r to
obtain a series of barometrical and thermometrical observations. Mr. Hacker
sketched a panorama of the rans:e from this point.

   A small and very steep glacier was also discovered; it feeds a beautiful little

green lake. Towards the end of August snowy weather alternated with days of

sunshine, and once we were obliged to wait a whole fortnight in one of thehuta

for the fog to lift.

       4. The Discovery of Australia. By Edward Heawood, M.A.

     The first authenticated voyage to Australia was made by a Dutch vessel in
1606, but it has been thought by many, from indications on maps of a much earlier
date, that voyages had been made by the navigators of some other European nation,

--early in the previous century. These maps are of the Dieppe school of carto-

graphy, and are all as regards this part of the world-- based on one prototype,
the earliest known to us dating from about 1536. They show a continental land
to the south-east of Java, bearing the name Jave la Grande, ' the Greater Java,' in
distinction from Java proper. The fairly full nomenclature round the coasts has

been thought to imply an actual discovery, and as Australia is the only large land
in this quarter of the globe, the land delineated has been supposed to represent

Australia.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ._
   A_
         comparison of the outlines of these maps with those of Australia shows little

real resemblance, while other considerations would rather lead to the conclusion
that Jave la Grande really represents a reduplication of Java proper in a greatly
exaggerated form. The influence of the old writers, especially Marco Polo, was
still very great at the beginning of the sixteenth century. That traveller spoke of
Java as Java Major, with a circuit of 3,000 miles, and his nomenclature was

followed by a large number of map makers. The native charts in use before the

advent of the Portuguese gave Java an inclination to the south-east, such as is

shown by the coast-line on the French maps, while the earliest Portuguese map of
the Archipelago presents a somewhat similar reduplication of Java. The charts of

Rodriguez, partly based on native material, are a proof that large-scale representa-

tions of Java were in existence at the time, while the extent of coast-line definitely
shown on the earliest of the French maps is absolutely identical with that of the

Javan coasts known to the Portuguese about 1519. The correspondence of the

outline is fairly satisfactory, especially in the south-west, while the scanty indica-

tions of the nomenclature point to Java at least as much as to Australia.
     Finally, the hypothetical nature of other details in these maps as regards the

Far East should make us hesitate to base the assumption of a discovery of Australia
in the fifteenth century on their unsupported testimony.

       6, The Relations of Christmas Island to the Neighhourhig Lands.

                        By C. W. Andrews, B.Sc, F.G.S.

     The author points out that in Christmas Island there is a long series of Ter-
tiary deposits, ranging, probably, from the Upper Eocene at least to the end of
the Miocene, and that these rocks are closely similar to deposits of the same age in
Java and the neighbouring islands.

     The relations of the present fauna and flora are considered, and it is shown
that they most nearly resemble those of the Indo-Malayan sub-region, but that in
certain cases the species are the same as some found in Ceylon, &c. Some of the
means by which the various plants and animals may have reached the island are

referred to.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

    Tlie President delivered the foUowlug Address :--

The prime concern of the economist and of the statistician is the condition of

the people. Other matters which eogao'e their attention particular problems,

-- --questions of history, discussions of method, developments of theory all derive their

ultimate importance from their bearing upon this central subject. The statistician
measures the changing phenomena of the production, distribution, and consumption
of wealth, which to a large extent reflect and determine the material condition of
the people. The economist analyses tlie motives of these phenomena, and

endeavours to trace the connection between cause and effect. He is unable to

push his analysis far without a firm mastery of the theory of value, the perfecting of

which has been the chief stride made by economic science in the nineteenth century.

When we read the ' Wealth of Nations ' we are forced to admit that in sheer
sagacity Adam Smith is unsurpassed by any of his successors. It is only when we
come to his imperfect and unconnected views upon value that we feel the power

of increased knowledge. J. S. Mill supposed in 1848 that the last word had been
said on the theory of value. In his third book he writes : ' In a state of society
in which the industrial system is entirely founded on purchase and sale . . . the
question of value is fimdamental. Almost every speculation respecting the
economical interests of a society thus constituted implies some theory of value :
the smallest error on this subject infects with corresponding error all our other
conclusions, and anything vague or misty in our conception of it creates confusion

and uncertainty in everything else.' And he adds : ' Happily, there is nothing in

the laws of value which remains for the present or any future writer to clear up
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the theory of the subject is complete.'

    We know now that he was wrong. Thanks in the main to economists still

alive, and especially to the mathematical economists, we have at length a theory
of value so formally exact that, whatever may be adrled to it in the future, time

can take nothing from it, while it is sufficiently flexible to lend itself as well to a,
regime of monopoly as to one of competition. Yet our confidence in this instrument

of analysis is far from inspiring us with the assurance which has done so much to
discredit economics by provoking its professors to dogmatise upon problems with
the whole facts of which they were imperfectly acquainted. Given certain conditions
of supply and certain conditions of demand, the economist should have no doubt
as to the resulting determination of value ; but he is more than ever alert to make
sure that he has all the material factors of the case before him ; that he understands
the facts and their mutual relation before he ventures to pronounce an opinion
upon any mixed question. He must have the facts before he can analyse them.

A small array of syllogisms, which, as Bacon says, ' master the assent and not the

subject,' are not ap adequate equipment for him. He sees more and more the need
                                                                                              Transactions of section f.                     8U

for careful and industrious investij^ation, and prominent among the subjects

whicli await bis trained observation are the condition of the people and the

related subject of the consumption of wealth. Training is, indeed, indispensable.

Every social question has its purely economic elements for the skilled economist

to unravel, and when this part of his task has been achieved, be is at an advantage

in approaching the other parts of it, while his habit of mind helps him to know

what to look out for and what to expect.

It is a curious paradox that, busying ourselves as we do with the condition of

the people, we are lamentably lacking in precision in our knowledge of the

economic life and state of the British people in the present day. Political economy

has, however, followed the lines of development of political power. At one time

--it was, as the Germans say, cameralistic an affair of the council chamber, a

question of the power and resources of the king. Taking a wider but still

restricted view of society, it became capitalistic, identifying the economic interests

of the community to a too great extent with those of the capitalist class. It has

at length become frankly democratic, looking consciously and directly to the

prosperity of the people at large.

Thus, then, we have at once a more accurate theory, a livelier sense of caution

as to its limitations in practice, and the widest possible field of study. So far as

most of us are concerned, we might as well spend our time in verifying the ready

recivoner as in tracing and retracing the lines of pure theory. These tools are

made for use. Economic science is likely to make the most satisfactory progress

if we watch the social forces that surround us, detecting the operation of economic

law in all its manifestations, and in observing, co-ordinating, and recording the

facts of economic life. It is not enough, to borrow the language of the biologist

(part of which he himself borrowed from the old economists), to talk of the

Westruggle for existence, the survival of the fittest, and of evolution.                                                                 want,
--above all, his spirit and his method the careful, minute, systematic observation of

life as affected by environment, heredity, and habit. Different problems are

brought to the front by different circumstances and appeal to different minds ; but
at all times and to all economists the condition of the people is of chief interest,

and the consumption of wealth is so closely connected with it that it might seem

superfluous to plead for its study. Yet some such plea is necessary. The arts of

production improve apace. The victories of science are rapidly utilised by manu-

facturers anxious to make a fortune. Even here the descriptive study of the

subject is hampered by the trade secrets involved in many processes, and by a
feeling that production may safely be left to the unresting intelligence of captains

of industry, so that the onlooker is chiefly concerned in this branch of the subject

with solicitude for the health and safety of the workmen employed. The depart-

ments of distribution and exchange appeal especially to the pride of intellect. The

--delicate theorems of value in all their branches wages, rent, interest, profits, the

--problems of taxation, the alluring study of currency, the mechanism of banking

and exchange have attracted the greatest share of the economist's attention. On

the practical side of distribution the growth of trade unions, the spread of educa-

tion, the improved standard of living, have increased the bargaining power of the

working classes and combined with other causes to effect a gratifying improvement

in the distribution of wealth, so that they receive a growing share of the growing
national dividedd. The practical and the speculative aspects alike of the con-

sumption of wealth have received less consideration. Nobody sees his way to a

fortune through the spread of more knowledge of domestic economy in workmen's

homes                                   and the scientific observer has curbed his curiosity before what might
                                     ;

seem an inquisitorial investigation into the question. What becomes of wages ?

Economists long ago discovered the necessity of distinguishing between money

--wages and real wages. It is now necessary for us to distinguish between real

wages and utilities not to stop at the fact that so many shillings a week miffht
procure such and such necessaries, comforts, or luxuries, but to ascertain how they
are expended. From the first we can deduce what the economic condition of the

people might be                                                                               from the second we shall know what it is.  And when we know
                                                                                           ;

what it is we shall see more clearly what with more wisdom it might become.

818 REPORT-- 1899.

Wealth, after all, is a means to an end. It is not enough to maximise wealth,

we must strive to maximise utilities. And we can no more judge of the condition

of a people from its receipts alone, than we can judge of the financial condition of a

nation from a mere statement of its revenues.

The condition of the people has, of course, improved, and is improving.

Public hygiene has made great progress, and houses are better and more sanitary,

though for this and other reasons rents have risen. Wages are higher. Commo-

dities are cheaper. Co-operation and the better organisation of retail business,

giving no credit, have saved some of the profits of middlemen for the benefit of

the consumer, while authority fights without ceasing against frauds in weights

and measures, and adulteration. Free libraries, museums, picture galleries, parks,

public gardens and promenades have multiplied, and it is almost sufficient to

observe that no one seems to be too poor to command the use of a bicycle. But

with all this progress it is to be feared that housekeeping is no better understood

--than it was two centuries ago perhaps even not so well. In the interval it has

become enormously simplified. The complete housewife is no longer a brewer, a

baker, a dyer, a tailor, and a host of other specialists roUed into one. But among the

working classes the advent of the factory system has increased the employment of

women and girls away from home to such an extent that many of them now marry

with a minimum of domestic experience, and are with the best intentions the

innocent agents of inefficiency and waste, even in this simplified household.

If we were suddenly swallowed up by the ocean, it appears probable that the

foreign student would find it easier to describe from existing documents the life and

home of the British craftsman in the middle ages than of his descendant of to-day.

[n part, no doubt, our fiscal system, with its few taxes upon articles of food and its

light pressure on the working classes, is responsible for this neglect. During the Napo-

leonic war Pitt sent for Arthur Young to ask him what were the ordinary and neces-

sary expenses of a workman's family, and the question would again become one of

practical politics if any large addition were required in the proceeds of indirect taxa-

Wetion. Taxation has the one advantage of providing us with statistics.        know

tolerably well the facts in the mass about the consumption of tea and coffee, dried

fruits and tobacco, and of alcohol, while the income tax (aided in the near future

by returns of the death duties) may give us some idea of the stratification of the

wealthier classes. But the details of consumption are stUl obscure. It has

ali-eady been suggested that some restraint may arise from the sentiment that
individuals are likely to resent wbat they may regard as a prying into their affairs.

But when we travel abroad we are curious to notice, and do notice without giving

offence, the dress, the habits, and the food of peasants and workmen ; and it is

difficult to resist the conclusion that we are less observant at home because these

common and trivial details appear to us unworthy of attention. In his ' Principles

of Economics ' Professor Marshall says : ' Perhaps 100,000,000/. annually are

spent even by the working classes, and 400,000,000/. by the rest of the population

of England, in ways that do little or nothing towards making life nobler or truly

happier.' And, again, speaking before the Royal Statistical Society in 1893:

' Something like the whole imperial revenue, say 100 millions a year, might be

saved if a sufficient number of able women went about the country and induced

the other women to manage their households as they did themselves.' These

figures show, at any rate, the possibilities of greatness in the economic progress

which may result from attention to the humblest details of domestic life.

     Economics, like other sciences, lies under a great debt of obligation to French
pioneers. The Physiocrats, or economistes, of the eighteenth century were the first
school of writers to make it worthy of the name of a science. In Cournot France

gave us a giant of originality in pure theory. In Comte we have a philosopher
iruitful in suggestion to the narrower economist. In Le Play we have a writer as
yet little known in England, but to whom recognition and respect are gi-adually

coming for his early perception of the importance of ascertaining the facts of con-
sumption, and it is to Le Play's * family budgets,' the receipts and expenses of
                                                                             ;;

Workmen s families, that I desire especially t j Ccall attention. I have given else-

where an account of his life and work.' Broadly speaking:, he set himself by the

comparative study of workmen's families in difl'erent countries of Europe to arrive at

the causes of well-being and of misery among the labouring classes. The subject

Wewas too large to lead him in many directions to very precise conclusions.  are

reminded in reading him of an incident at a dinner of the Political Economy Club

in 187G, when Mr. Robert Lowe propounded the question, ' What are the more

important results which have followed from the publication of the " Wealth of

Nations " just one hundred years ago ? ' Some of the most enthusiastic admirers of

Adam Smith were present, Mr. Gladstone and M. Leon Say among the number

and Mr. Lowe trenchantly declared that it all came to this : ' The causes of wealth

are two, industry and thrift ; the causes of poverty are two, idleness and waste.'

It was left to Mr. W. E. Forster to make the rugged remarlc, ' You don't want

--to go to Adam Smith for that you can get that out of the Proverbs of Solomon.'

And Le Play's conclusions frequently go still further back, to the Decalogue.

There are, however, many observations, suggestive and original, upon the material
facts, the economic life, of the families he brought under review. And we are

now concerned rather with his method than with his conclusions. Given half a

dozen Le Plays applying their minds to the study of the consumption of wealth
among the working classes of England, we might expect soon to see a greater

advance in comfort, a greater rise in the standard of life, than improved arts of

production alone are likely to yield in a generation. Certain English writers had,

indeed, prepared family budgets before Le Play arose. But their method was

usually incomplete, except for the specific purpose they had before them. David

Davies and Sir F. Eden were chiefly concerned with the poor law, Arthur Young

and Cobbett with agricultural politics, Dudley Baxter and Leone Levi with taxa-

tion, Le Play may fairly be called the father of the scientific family budget.

His studies of four English families * are the most complete economic pictures

of English popular life to be found in literature. With the aid of some local

authority he chose what was thought a fairly typical family, and then, frankly

explaining his scientific object and securing confidence, he set himself to study it.

ANothing of economic interest is too unimportant for him to record.  minute

inventory and valuation of clothes, furniture, and household goods ; a detailed

account, item by item, of income from all sources and of expenditure upon all

objects for a year, with the quantities and prices of foods, &c. ; a description of the

family, member by member, their past history, their environment, how they came

to be where they are and to earn their living as they do ; their resources in the

present, their provision for the future ; their meals, hygiene, and recreations

--their social, moral, political, and religious observances nothing escapes him. And

the whole is organised, classified, fitted into a framework identical for all cases,

with the painstaking and methodical industry of the naturalist Contrasted with

this the realism of novelists, the occasional excursions of journalists, the observa-

tions of professed economists, are pitiably incomplete. As early as 1857 Le Play

found one ardent admirer in England, Mr. W. L. Sargant, whose ' Economy of

the Labouring Classes,' avowedly inspired by Le Play, is a valuable and interesting

piece of work. Since then, however, with the magnificent exception of Mr.

Charles Booth, little has been done to throw light upon the mode of life of the

wage-earners of England. The Board of Trade heralded the formation of its

-- --Labour Department by issuing a Blue Book unhappily without sequel entitled

' Eeturns of Expenditure by Working Men,' 1889, and the Economic Club has
published a useful collection of studies in * Family Budgets,' 1896. But we shall

probably still depend very much upon foreign observers for fuller knowledge of

the subject. M. Ren(5 LavoU^e, an adherent who may almost be called a col-

league of Le Play, has devoted to England a whole volume of his important work

M. Urbain Gu(5rln, another member of the Soci(5te d'Ecoilomie Sociale founded

by Le Play to carry ou his work, has recently added a study of a taDuer's

family in Nottingham to Le Play's gallery of portraits : and some of the young

members of the Musee Social and the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques have

Acome among us animated with the same scientific curiosity.  vivid (and, so far

as Newcastle is concerned, a trustworthy) sketch by a German miner, ' How the

English Workman lives,' just translated into English, is our latest debt to foreign

observers. It may be hoped that the British Association, largely attended as it is
by persons who woidd shrink from more ambitious scientific labours, will furnish

some workers ready to do their country the very real service of recording such

facts as they can collect about the economic habits of our own people, and so
helping us to know ourselves.

Consider, for a moment, the consumption of food. To the ordinary English

workman life would seem unendurable without white wheaten bread. Other forms

of bread he knows there are, but he has unreasoning prejudices against wholemeal

-- --bread the food of workhouses and prisons and .against rye bread or other kinds

of bread, the food of foreigners. But in many parts of Europe the working

classes have no bread. Cereals of some sort, prepared in some way, they of course

employ. Wheat, oats, rye, barley, maize, buckwheat, even chestnuts, are used

indifferently in different places, and rice and potatoes are among the substitute?.

What is the relative value of these as food-stuffs, and what is the best mode of

preparing them ? The reasons which induced men in the middle ages to consume
the cereals of their own neighbourhood have been so much weakened by the

cheapening of transport and the international specialisation of industries, that the

conservatism of food habits is brought into strong relief when we find neighbour-

ing peoples abandoning, first in town and then in country, marked distinctions of

Wenational costumes, but clinging everywhere to national differences of food.

are perhaps on the eve of considerable changes here. Two years ago an American

economist told me in Boston that fruit had been the great ally of the workmen in a

recent severe strike. There had been an exceptionally large crop of bananas, which

were sold at one cent apiece, and the strikers had sustained themselves and their

--families almost entirely upon bananas at a trifling cost very greatly below their

usual expense for food. Returning to London I found bananas on sale in the

streets for a halfpenny. No doubt they were consumed here in addition to, and

not in substitution for, ordinary food ; but they illustrate the fact that the foods
of other latitudes are no longer the sole luxury of the rich, but are brought within

the reach of all classes, and that our popular food habits need no longer be made

to conform to the narrow range of former days, but may be put upon a wider

rational basis. The vegetarians, largely dependent upon other countries, have

recognised this. The chemist and the physiologist might give us great assistance

in these matters. Most of the calculations which I have seen as to the constituents

of foods, their heat-giving and nutritive properties, appear to ignore the greater or

less facility with which the different foods are assimilated. It is surprising that

rice, in .some respects the most economical of all grains, needing no milling,

easily cooked and easily digested, is not more largely consumed by the poorer

families in this country.

The effect upon our food habits of the introduction of railways and the supply

of comparatively cheap fuel to every household is almost incalculable. But for

this the consumption of tea, perhaps even of potatoes where there is no peat, would

be very small. The preference of the French for liquid, and of the English for

solid, food has been attributed to the greater relative facilities which the French

once enjoyed for making a fire, though the persistence (if not the origin) of our

popular habits in this respect probably lies rather in the fact that a Frenchwoman's

cookery makes greater demands upon her time and attention. One result of this

preference is that the essential juices of meat preserved by the French in soups

and ragouts are with us to a large extent absolutely wasted. Owners of small

house properties complain that, however well trapped their sinks may be, the pipes

are constantly choked, and that the mysterious mischief is almost invariably cured

by liberal doses of boiling water which melt the solidified fats cast away in a state

of solution. The number of persons who died of stari'ation in the administiative

county of London in 1898, or whose death was accelerated by privation, amounted

to 48 ; and we shall be pretty safe in estimating the total number in the United
Kingdom at something less than 500. The common and inevitable reflection is

that they might have been easily relieved from the superfluities of the rich but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

it is true also that their sufficient sustenance was destroyed many times over

through tlie ignorance of the poor. It would be difficult to find an English

cookery book which a workman's wife would not reject as too fanciful and ambi-

Atious to be practical.  little French treatise, La parfaite Caisiniere, ou CArt

d'uiiliser Ics Hestes, strikes in its title at any rate the keynote of the popular

domestic economy of which we stand much in need in England. Housekeeping,

even the humblest, is a skilled business. To know what to buy, how to use it,

and how to utilise waste does not come by the light of nature. If more knowledge

and more imagination were devoted to the teaching of cookery in our Board

schools, the family meal might be made more varied, more appetising, more

attractive, and more economical, leaving a larger margin for the comforts,

Aculture, and recreations which help to develop the best social qualities.

happy family is a family of good citizens. It would be discourteous to another

Section of this Association to quote without reserve the mot of Brillat-Savarin :

' He who discovers a new dish does more for the happiness of mankind than he

Wewho discovers a new planet.'  must stipulate that the new dish effects an im-

provement in the economy of the working classes.

Take, again, the consumption of coal. Mr. Sargant says : ' It is impossible to

say how much of the superiority of English health and longevity is owing to the

Weuse of open fireplaces probably a considerable part is owing to it.; all know

how close and stifling is the atmosphere of a room heated by a stove, and how

much more difficult it is to keep a room perfectly ventilated in summer than it is

in winter, when the fire is constantly changing the air. It may be true that three-

fourths of the heat of our fireplaces passes up the chimney and is lost to us but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

we gain far more advantage by the fresh air constantly introduced into the room.'

Now with improved grates and improved fireplaces we may retain all the

advantages of the open fire without so great a waste either of the substance of the

consumer or of the national stock of coal ; and attention is already being devoted

to this fact in middle-class households, but some time must yet elapse before the

advantage is reaped by the working classes. At a former meeting of this Associa-

tion Mr. Edward Atkinson exhibited a portable oven or cooking-stove, which was

a marvel of simplicity and economy. He has described it at length in his ' Science
of Nutrition,' 1892. He argues that the attempts to combine cooking with the

warming of a room or house are absurdly wasteful ; that almost the whole of the

fuel used in cooking is wasted ; and that nine-tenths of the time devoted to

watching the process of cooking is wasted ; and he estimates the waste of food

from bad cooking in the United States at 1,000,000,000 dollars a year. I have

not, however, heard of his oven being at all extensively used.

Upon the thorny subject of dress it is perilous to venture ; but it is impossible

to be in the neighbourhood of a London park on a Sunday afternoon without

feeling that the efforts of domestic servants to follow the rapidly changing vagaries

of fashion are carried to a pernicious degree of waste. The blouse of the French

workman and the bare head of the Parisian factory-girl or flower-girl are infinitely

more pleasing than the soiled and frowsy woollens or the dowdy hats of their

English fellows, nor does the difference of climate afford an adequate explanation

Weof the difference of habit.  must perhaps admit a greater dislike in England

to any external indication of a difference in wealth by a costume different in kind.

M. Lavollee, after referring to the low price of the ready-made suits which the

English factories ' fling by the million on the markets of the world, including their

own,' adds : ' This extraordinary cheapness is, however, not always without

inconvenience to the consumer. If the clothes he buys cost little, they are not

lasting, and their renewal becomes in the long run very burdensome. This

renewal is, too, the more frequent in that the wife of the English workman is in

her role as a housewife too difficult for her to support, the woman of the people 13

generally, on the other side of the Channel, a rather poor cook, an indifferent needle-

woman, aud a still more indifferent hand at repairs.' As a consequence, he says, the
English workman has often no alternative hut to wear his garments in holes or to

replace them by others. Given an equal income, there is probably no doubt that

a French working-class family will be better fed and better clad than a corre-
sponding English family dealing in the same market, and will lay up a larger
stock of the household goods, and especially linen, which are the pride of the

French peasant.
     The waste resulting from the immoderate use of alcohol and from the wide-

spread habit of betting, serious as they are, need not detain me, as I wish to confine
myself more particularly to waste which can hardly be called intentional. It is

not suggested that every man should confine his expenditure to what is strictly
necessary to maintain his social position. The great German writer on finance,

Professor Wagner, is accustomed to say that * parsimony is not a principle.' It is

sometimes, indeed, a bad  policy and  a  wasteful  policy                                 and life would be a very
                                                                                       ;

dull business if its monotony were not relieved by amusement and variety even at

the occasional expense of thrift. Le Play refers to tobacco as ' the most economical

Howof all recreations.'   else, he asks, could the Hartz miner ' give himself an

agreeable sensation' a thousand times in a year at so low a cost as 10 francs ?

But nobody would wish to .see a free man using his tobacco like the Russian

prisoners described to me by Prince Kropotkin, as chewing it, drying and smoking

it, and finally snuffing the ashes ! jS'or should we desire to eradicate from society

Anthe impulses of hospitality, and even of a certain measure of display.                                                                               austere

and selfish avarice, if generally diffused, may strike at the very existence of a

nation.

    Another respect in which French example may be profitable to us is the muni-
cipal management of funerals (^jowyjes fimebres). Many a struggling family of

the working classes has been .seriously crippled by launching out into exaggerated

expenses at the death of one of its members, and especially of a bread-winner.

The French system, while preserving the highest respect for the dead, has some

respect for the living, who are frequently unable and unwilling at a time of

bereavement to resist any suggestion for expensive display which seems to them

a last token of afi'ection as well as a proof of self-respect.

    As regards housing, the English cottage or artisan's house is regarded on the

Continent rather as a model  for imitation than as a  subject                             for criticism                                                but the
                                                                                                                                                    ;

pressure of population upon space in our large cities, joined with a love of life in

the town, may possibly prove too strong for the individualist's desire for a house

to himself. If we should be driven to what Mrs. Leonard Courtney has proposed

to call Associated Homes, the famillistere founded by M. Godin at Guise, and
rooted in the idea of Fourier's phalanstere, will show us what has already been

achieved in this direction. Dissociated from industrial enterprise it might easily

become popular in England. Some of its collective economies are certainly de-

serving of imitation, and the experience not only of the Continent, but also of

America, may soon bring us face to face with the question whether the prepara-

-- --tion of dinners, in large towns, should not at least for the working classes be

left to the outside specialist like the old home industries of baking and brewing.

An excellent example of scientific observation is ' Les Maisons types ' by M. de
Foville, the well-known master of the French Mint. He describes in detail

the various forms of huts, cottages, and houses scattered over France in such

a fashion that it is said the traveller in a railway train may tell, by reading
the book, through what part of the country he is passing ; and he gives the reasons,

founded upon history or local circumstances, for the peculiarities in architecture to

be observed. The book is a useful warning against rash generalisations as to the

best type of house for a working man.

the watering of plants.' He says : ' The detection of waste is carried out by means

of meters placed on the mains,' which record automatically the quantity of water
passing hour by hour throughout the day and night. The whole area served by a

given water supply is mapped out into small districts, each of which is controlled

by one of these detective meters. The chart traced by the apparatus shows pre-

cisely how much water is used in each of the tweuty-feur hours. It records in a
grtphic form and with singular fidelity the daily life of the people. It shows when

they get up in the morning, when they go to bed at night, when they wasti the tea-
things, the children, and the clothes ; it shows in a suburban district when the

head of  the household comes home  from the city  and  starts watering his  flowers
                                                                                                           ;

it shows when the watering-cart goes round; hut, above all, it shows when the

water is running away to waste and how much.'

I quote this not to multiply examples of the waste of wealth, but to illustrate

the insight which a few figures, such as those recorded by this meter, give us into

Howthe lives of the people.  much more does the account-book, a detective meter

of every economic action, give us an animated photograph of the family life

Nothing is so calculated to stimulate social sympathy or to suggest questions for

consideration. Like a doctor's notes of his patients the facts are not for publication

in any form which will reveal the identity of the subject ; but when we have
Weenough of them they will be of the highest scientific value.
                                                                     have at present

too few to offer any useful generalisations. All that can be done is to serve as a

finger-post to point the road along which there is work to be done.

If nothing has been said about the waste and extravagance of the wealthier

classes, it is because economy is with them of less moment. They suifer little or

no privation from extravagance, and derive less advantage from checking it than

those to whom every little is a help. And so far as much of this waste is con-*

cerned, they sin against the hght. It is one thing to point out a more excellent

way to the unwary, another to preach to those who, seeing the better, follow the

worse.

But the expenditure of the workiug classes is also, from a scientific p^int of

view, vastly more important. Their expenses are more uniform, less disturbed by

fantasy, or hospitality, or expensive travel, and will give us more insight into the
hitherto inscrutable laws of demand. The time is far removed when any reduc-

tion in the cost of living could be successfully made the pretext for a reduction in
the rate of wages. The Committee on the Aged Deserving Poor recommends

under certain conditions pensions varying with the ' cost of living in the locality.'

The same factor, we are told, enters into the adjustment of postmen's wages as

between town and town. How are we to know the comparative cost of living

Howwithout these details of expenditure ?      else can we measure wi' h any exact-

Howness the progress of civilisation itself ?  else can we discover the cohesive

force of the family in holding together the structure of society, the mutual succour

of young and old, the strong and the infirm or sick, the well-to-do and the victim
of accident or ill-luck ? To what department soever of economic life we turn our

eyes we find live men and women, born into families, living in families, their social
happiness and efSciency largely dependent on their family lives, and when we

consider how greatly our knowledge and insight into society will be increased by
a more intimate acquaintance with the economics of the family, we may well

cherish the highest hopes for the future progress of our science. The theory of this

subject, at any rate, is not * complete.' It has not even been begun.

Upon certain aspects of the spending or using of wealth as opposed to the get-

ting of wealth, like the expenditure of central and local governments, it would hardly

be proper for me to enlarge. The first is subject to the watchful control of the

taxpayer, of Parliament, and of a highly trained civil service ; the second to the
jealous criticism of the ratepayer and his representative. But there is some social

expenditure, like the scandalous multiplication of advertisements (which by a refine-

ment of cruelty give us no rest night or day), which is wicked to a degree. In all

these matters of the consumption of wealth, individually and collectively, we
are as yet, it must be again repeated, too ignorant of the facts. An unimagi-

native people as we are, we are fortunately fond enough of travel to have sugges-

lions constantly forced upon us ty the different experiences and habits of foreign

countries. And we are happy in a neighbour lilie France, -with her literary and

social charms and graces, her scientific lucidity and inventiveness, and the contrasts

of her social genius to inspire comparisons, and in many respects to set us examples.

I have singled out one of her many writers for attention, precisely because of this

quality of suggestiveuess. Other investigators have, of course, attacked the sub-

ject. In Belgium and Switzerland. Germany, Italy and Austria, and the United

States, governments and individuals have recently undertaken the preparation of

family budgets ; but in many respects Le Plays monographs are the first and

greatest of all. They yield excellent material, upon which Science, in its various

branches, has yet to do work which will benefit mankind in general ; and promises

especially to beneiit the people of this country. The cosmopolitan attitude of

the older economists was largely due to their centring their attention upon

the problems of excliauge. To them the globe was peopled by men like our-

selves, producing the fruits of the earth, anxious to exchange them to the greatest

mutual advantage, but hindered from doing so by the perversity of national

governments. The facts of consumption, at any rate, are local. They are often

determined  by geology,  geography, climate,  and  occupation                                                     and,  however  fully

we maj' admit the economic solidarity of the world, and the advantage which

one part of it derives from the prosperity of another, yet we may be easily forgiven

for thinking that our first duty lies to our own brethren; that our natural

work is that which lies at our own doors ; that, as the old proverb says, ' the skin is

nearer than the shirt.' And we may fairh' be excused if we attempt to make our

contribution to the welfare of the human family through the improvement of the

consumption of wealth and the condition of the people in our own land.

1. The Mercantile System o/'Laisser Faire. By Ethel R. Faraday, M.A.

     The English laisser faire school, originally founded on a cosmopolitan theory

of economics, occupies at present a position as purely nationalist as that of the
mercantile school which it succeeded. This is the effect of a dogmatic insistence
on the economic ideal as stated by Cobden, and a resulting indifference towards
five recent developments of economic thought: the separation of the science froua
the art of economics, the definition of the science and of its subject wealth, the

humanist philosophy, the imperial idea, and the theory of relativity. The early
free-traders, sharing the confusion prevalent fifty years ago between the economic
science and art, exaggerated the functions of liberty in both, and were led in
consequence to an uncritical identification of individual and cosmopolitan with

national interests. They inherited Adam Smith's inclination to confine the idea

of wealth to material goods ; and by over-estimating, not the importance of mate-
rial interests, but their influence, exposed themselves to the charge of materialism
and selfishness, both individual and national. Cobden himself was not a mate-

rialist, and never lost sight of the human element in economics ; but his followers

have neglected this aspect of his teaching, and have laid a disproportionate stress
on those points which circumstances had already obliged him to assert with
exceptional force. They have moreover imitated his undiscriminating dislike for
imperialism, and, while constantly sacrificing cosmopolitan theory to nationalist
practice, have ignored the possibilities of the empire as an economic unit satisfying
both nationalist and cosmopolitan ideals. The laisser faire school have never
advanced beyond the mercantile theory of colonies, and their policy if unchecked
would have led, as that of their predecessors did, to disintegration. Their neglect
of the imperial idea, as illustrated by their recent insensibility to the injuries

inflicted, by a policy of non-interference, on India and the West Indies, may be

further explained by their refusal to admit the principle of relativity into the
application of economic laws. But the safety and utility of economic, as of other
tri4ths, depend ou the acknowledgment of their relativity.

            2. On Geometrical Illustrations of the Theory of Eent}

     If .1- denote outla}^, inclusive of interest, and y the return which it bi'ing^, then

y- X will be the surplus which governs rent. Let s stand for y - x, and let the curve

whose co-ordinates are x, z be plotted, also the curve whose co-ordinates are x, y,
the axis of x being in both cases horizontal.

     The cultivator aims at making the surplus proQt z a maximum. The condition

-- ^for this is = 0, or = 1 ; in other words, that a very small increment (positive
               dx dx
or negative) of x brings an equal increment oi y and leaves z unchanged. For that
value of .r which makes z a maximum, the tangent to the x, z curve is horizontal,
aaid the tangent to the x, y curve slopes at 45°. For smaller values the tangent
to the X, y curve is steeper, and for larger values less steep than 45°. The received

theory asserts that the actual rent fis settled by competition will be the maximum

value" of z. More precisely, in view of the practical impossibility of foreseeing

what outlay will in a given year be most remunerative, the rent may be taken to
be that value of z which makes as near an approach to the maximum as a fairly

skilful cultivator will usually attain.

     The ordinary mode of graphically illustrating rent is by a curve in which the

abscissa .r represents outlay, and the ordinate »? is such that the integral of rjdx,
from.r = to any specified value of the outlay .r, represents the return for that
outlay. The rent is represented by that portion of the area which lies above a
horizontal line drawn through the top of the last ordinate, the last ordinate beuig

that which corresponds to the limit of profitable cultivation. This mode of repre-
sentation is less simple than either of the two above employed. It also involves

--the inconvenience of assigning a shape to the early part of the curve a part which
--has no definite shape and the further drawback of representing two comparable

things, outlay and return, by two magnitudes which are not comparable, length

and area.

3, On the Use of Galionian and other Curves to represent Statistics.
                     By Professor F. Y. Edgewoutii.

Comparing different modes of representmg statistics oi frequency, such as the

returns which specify the number of persons in a country having each amount of

income, the author gives the preference to those formula which not only fit the

data, but also are recommended by an a priori reason. Such a reason is commonly

afforded by the phenomena of organic and social life : where a great number of

independently varying influences go to the formation of a result, the quantity of

that result is apt to vary according to the normal law of ' error' or frequency.

The symmetrical curve which is often employed to express that law is but a first

approximation, the normal curve of frequency is in general somewhat unsymme-

Atrical.  very unsymmetrical group, indeed such as that which the frequency of

incomes of different sizes constitutes, cannot be represented by a normal curve, but

it may often be connected therewith by the hypothesis that each observation,

though not identical with or proportional tc, is yet dependent on a function of

some attribute which fluctuates according to the normal law.

                 1. Some Aspects of American Municipal Finance.

          By J. H. Hollander, Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University.

     The fiscal activities of cities of the United States of 50,000 or more inhabitants
have been characterised in the main by, (1) Progressive expenditure, (2) inelastic
revenue, (.3) increasing funded indebtedness, (4) crude budgetary procedure.

^ I Publishea in the Journal of the Roijfd Statistical Society, December IS'J?,
826 REPORT--1899.

The problem of expenditure is that of the modern industrial city. Urban

growth involves an improvement in the quality, and in, up to a certain point, a more

tlian proportionate increase in the cost of municipal service. It is not only a

question of paving and lighting more streets, but of substituting asphalt for rough

stones, and electric light for oil lamps.

The essential source of municipal income in the United States has been the

general property tax. Inefficiency of administrative machinery and the escape of

intangible wealth have combined to render this tax an increasingly rigid form of

revenue. Save in the case of cities still undergoing rapid expansion, the taxable

basis increases slowly, and increased expenditure necessitates an addition to a

burdensome and, not infrequently, an oppressive local rate.

  --These two conditions urgency of municipal expenditure and inelasticity of
--municipal income have heightened the natural tendency of the American city to

the use of large funded loans for the extension of the municipal plant. Stimulated

by the high favour of municipal securities as a form of private investment and by

the easier terms upon which municipal loans can be negotiated, American cities

have shown no hesitation in borrowing upon long time the funds required for

desirable improvements properly chargeable to current expenditure, but for which

there existed no likelihood of an ordinary budgetary provision.

The budgetary procedure of the American city has been a crude adjustment of

a local tax rate to the anticipated expenditure by a variously constituted ways

and means committee of the municipal council. The utility of a low tax rate as

political capital has commonly resulted in an impossible reduction of departmental

--estimates (subsequently corrected by extra-budgetary appropriations), or by a

deliberate over-estimate of municipal income with the common result of a floating

debt, ultimat(-ly funded as a permanent deficit.

The probable tendencies of American municipal finance in the several par-

ticulars indicated are: (1) Continued progressive increase in expenditure; (2) a

more efficient administration of the general property tax                                                                                                                                                                                                                 (3)  longer use of sources

2. Municipal Trading and Profits. By Robert Donald.

There should be no reason to object to Municipal trading, from a commercial

point of view, as the figures in a recent Government return show that the average

annual profit on Municipal water, gas, and electricity works, markets, tramways,

and workmen's dwellings amounts to 4| per cent, on the capital invested.
    The chief opposition to Municipal trading last Session of Parliament arose with

electricity supply. It will be found that Municipalities produce electricity at a lower

Acost and supply it at lower prices than do companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         comparison between

twenty-one Municipal and twenty-one company undertakings, including in the

latter the large London concerns and the companies of Birmingham, Leeds, and

Sheffield, where the supply has been recently Municipalised, gives the following

result :--
--Cost of production per unit Municipalities, l'87t^. ; Companies, 2'7ld.
--Average price per unit to consumer
                                                     Companies, 5^d.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Municipalities, 4W.
                                                                                                                                       ;
--Profit on mean capital Companies, 7i per cent. ; Municipalities, 7j per cent.

Thus municipalities produce electricity at ^d. less per unit than companies, sell

it at Id. less per unit, and earn only ^ per cent, less profit.

Municipalities as a rule supply gas of a higher illuminating power than

Acompanies and at a lower price.                     comparison between a representative number

of Municipal and privately managed Gas Works shows that the average price of

the Municipal gas is less by 2d. per 1,000 cubic feet, the candle power is higher,

and the average profit on capital employed only 1 per cent, less than that obtained

by companies.

The direct operation of tramways by Corporations has been done under easy

conditions as regards capital expenditure, and has at once led to increased traffic.

Tlaere Las been a readier response to public demands, a reduction of fares, and

--better treatment of employes all of which have combined to make Municipal

tramways very successful from a business point of view.
     Municipal trading compares well with private enterprise. But it is not enough

to show protits from Municipal trading, as it is suggested that SJ^unicipalities have

no business to make profits. These are chiefly the people who would like the

profits for themselves. But there are other reasons, based on economical grounds,

why the aim of Municipalities should be to provide the cheapest services at cost

price rather than seek profit. The system of relieving general local taxation out
of the surplus revenues of gas, water, and tramway and other undertakings hais

but the policy is not one which best serves a community. AVhen a town draws
profit from gas, water, or electricity supplies, it is simply levying so much direct
taxation on the users of these commodities for the benefit of the general community.
The consumers might justly say that since the Municipality became the sole
providers of gas and electricity, it deprived them of the advantages of competition,

and should supply the cheapest possible article.

    Whether municipalities should make a profit is left largely to their own
discretion. It is becoming the practice not to make trading profits from water

supply, and only a small margin of profit is sought on artisans' and labourers'
dwellings and lodging houses. The practice of Parliament tends towards restrict-

ing profits. Profit from, electricity supply works, for instance, is limited to

5 per cent. All surplus above that should be devoted to reducing charges. In
Scotland, pnfit-making in connection with water or gas supplies is rendered
impossible by the General Acts, which provide that surpluses go to reduce charges.

No town has advanced so far in Municipal organisation as Glasgow, and no town

stands higher for the efficiency of its administration or the civic spirit of its
citizens ; and nowhere else, taken all round, are charges for Municipal services so

low ; nor has any other town carried out so systematically the policy of little

profit.

     It will be found that in the towns where the civic spirit is the keenest and
healthiest, where Municipal institutions are most largely developed, there the
profit sought is least and the administration is the best.

3. The Single Tax. By William Smart, M.A., LL.D., Adam Smith Pro-

            fessor of Political Economy in the University of Glasgoiv.^

     In the universal division and co-operation of industry by which the national
dividend is produced and distributed, as ' at once the net product of and the sole
source of payment for all the instruments of production within the country,' the
economic position of the Government is this. The Government services, imperial
and local, are a part of this dividend, purveyed by a certain class of the citizens
just as ordinary goods and services are purveyed by other classes; they are paid
for partly by fees, but principally by taxation. This is disguised by the definition
of a tax as a ' compulsory contribution ; ' but, on analj'sis, the compulsory contri-
bution is seen to be nothing else than a payment for definite services rendered to
the citizens generally, the price paid by the individual citizen being, not a com-
petitive price, but an equality of sacrifice price.

     The Single Tax, on the other hand, is an outcome of Henry George's theory
that the cause of poverty in progressive societies is private property in land. Of
the two alternatives, to formally confiscate the land without any compensation or
to confiscate its rent, he chose the latter. This would, of course, give the Govern-
ment an immense revenue, and taxation would be unnecessary.

     Evidently this is not a rival system of taxation to ours, as the Impot Unique
might have been, but an alternative plan of confiscation. Instead of the old
constitutional connection, by which every citizen has a stake and a voice in the

economy and good management of tlie Government revenue because lie pays
annually his due fliare of it, we have in the Single Tax a method by which the
Government acquiies an estate of its own b}' confiscating the property of one class.

              4. The State as Investor. By Edwin Cannan, M.A.

     If an indebted individual has more capital than he is able to use in his particu-
lar business, the general rule is that his best investment is repayment of his debts.
The same rule applies to a state. So till within recent years it was never doubted
that the proper investment of the National Sinliing Fund and the Post Office
Savings Bank deposits was in the redemption, or (what comes to the same thing)
the purchase of (lovernment obligations. But under the conversion scheme of

1888, consols became irredeemable till 1923, and there is now no portion of the

funded debt which can be redeemed before 190.5. The effect of this, combined
with the fall in the market rate of interest, which began not long after 1888, and con-
tinued till last year, has been to keep consols and other portions of the funded debt

at prices considerably above par. When a stock is temporarily irredeemable and

meanwhile above par, the general rule that repayment of debt is the best invest-
ment of surplus capital need not be applicable. Whether it is the best or not
depends on the magnitude of the premium.

     Supposing the premium to be high enough to drive the State to other invest-
ments, we have in the obligations of local authorities an excellent secxirity entirely
under the control of the State. It has been objected that municipal and county
stocks could not be bought bj' the million without raising the price to a prohibi-
tive height, and this is true. But no such objection applies to lending new capital
when it is required. This has already been done to the extent of f()rty millions,
and it might be done to a much larger extent if the minimum rate of interest were
slightly reduced and the scale under which higher rates are charged for loans of
longer duration were altogether abolished. The scale is defended on the ground
that it is desirable to discourage loans for long periods. But as a matter of fact it
is not desirable to discourage loans properly authorised for long periods, and thb

scale does not discourage them.

5. The Mercantile System. By Professor G. J. Stokes.

     The policy of Free-trade receives no support from the analogy either of the
individual or of the family. At first sight the collective national expenditure seems

more in need of systematic guidance than individual expenditure.

The principles of the Mercantile System may be considered in relation to (1) the

end in view                                                 (2)  the means employed.
                                                         ;

The end in view was the accumulation of money or of the precious metals.

Mill's criticisms on the doctrine that the wealth of a country consists in money
err in two respects, in the sense in which he regards money as a part of wealth

and in that in which he regards other articles of wealth as distinguishable from

money. Mill really shares the error of the Mercantile doctrines. The Mercantile

doctrine was relatively justified in its aim of creating a reserve of purchasing power
in a country. The means employed were attention to the balance of trade. The

real citadel of the Free-trade argument consists in the effect on prices of an

artificial enlargement of the currency. In consequence of this the Mercantile

System defeated itself in seeking to control the balance of trade. If, however,

we substitute the policy of accumulating Immaterial Imports for that of the Mer-
cantile System, the arguments in favour of Protection acquire a new significance.

In so far as the interest on foreign securities is not accumulated, it is desirable that it

should be paid in certain kinds of products. The financial needs of the state fix

a lower limit for the accumulation of immaterial imports. The larger the area em-

braced under our political and financial polity the better is it for the nation au4

fof mfinkind.

work. The method of arrangement, however, is different from his, as he measured
wages in industries, whereas wages are in this instance measured in towns. The
year 1840 has been taken as 100, and the averages are simple arithmetical averages
of the figures collecred. Twenty-three towns are selected, and the wages format
least thirty -five separate industries are to be found in the tables on which the
calculations are based. The index number so obtained is as follows:

              3. Indian Currency after the Eeport of the Commission.

                                By Hermann Schmidt.

     The monetary enactments passed a few days ago in India may be considered

the evolution of the policy adopted in 1893. This policy intended to substitute

gold for silver as the money of India. It was adopted on the report of the First
Indian Currency Committee of 1892-3. But the Indian Coinage and Paper
Currency Act of 1893 was essentially a provisional measure. It left the settlement
of a permanent rate of exchange between gold and the silver rupee in abeyance.
Gold was not yet made legal tender. This defect has now been remedied upon
another exhaustive investigation by a new Currency Committee. India has now a
gold standard in the sense that a parity has been fixed between gold acd silver,
and that the mints are open to the coinage of gold and closed to the coinage of
silver. But the success of the year's work is still as much in doubt as was that of

the measures of 1893.

Within the last ten years, various experiments have been made by different

Boards of Guardians with approval of the Local Government Board, the object

in view being either {a) to secure better results to the persons helped, or {b) to
effect economy in cost of poor relief

Four of these experiments, the results of which seem worthy of notice, are

tributing from Poor Law Funds to organisations under the control of voluntary

committees, who, on such sums being contributed, receive those who have been

able-bodied inmates of workhouses into the institutions under their control. In

summing up the results gained by these various experiments, it is suggested as to

(«), that classification is difficult, and not likely to be capable of great extension in
existing workhouses ; as to (6), that the treatment of children by 'village com-

munities,' 'boarding out,' or 'scattered homes' has shown beneficial results in

comparison with retaining them in worlihouses or barrack schools, the ' scattered
home ' system having proved most desirable under usual conditions ; as to (c), that
the working of farms, as shown by the results at Sheffield and elsewhere, has
been found distinctly profitable and beneficial where proper conditions have been

observed in choice and management of property; as to {d), that much good has

been effected where the institutions so assisted have been farm labour colonies, of

such a character as those now in operation at Lingfield in Surrey, under the

control of the Christian Union for Social Service, near Dumfries in Scotland, at
Hadleigh in Essex, and elsewhere. It would seem that by reason of such farms

not only has the cost of poor relief been lessened, but men restarted in an indepen-

dent life.

Having regard to these results, it is suggested that the principle of the Bill

submitted to Parhament last Session for creation of Aged People's Homes by Poor

Law authorities should be supported, as affording a most desirable means oi

classification                                                  and                 that further  extension of  the  system                                    of   contributing towards

the support of Farm Labour Colonies, under the control of voluntary committees,

should be encouraged.

2. Old Age Pensions in Denmark : their Influence on Thrift and Pauperism.

                          By Professor A. W. Flux, M.A.

     Thepaper deals with some of the results of the establishment of a system of
Old Age Eelief in Denmark. The allegation that the lice between pauper and
pensioner would become indistinguishable is contradicted by experience. The

statement that deposits in the savings banks are falling off since the establishment
of the pension system (in 1891) is not supported bv the figures of deposits. These
increased by 25-4 per cent, between 188.; and 1887 ; by 21-8 per cent, between
1887 and 1892, and by 25-0 per cent, between 1802 and 1807.

                          TJIURSDAT, SEPTEMBER U.

     The President delivered the following Address :

In this Address it is proposed to review briefly the characteristic features of the
progress made in steam navigation ; to glance at the principal causes of advance
in the speeds of steamships and in the lengths of the voyages on which such vessels

can be successfully employed ; and to indicate how the experience and achieve-

ment of the last sixty years bear upon the prospects of further advance.
    There is reason to hope that this choice of subject is not inappropriate. From

the beginning of steam navigation the British Association in its corporate capacity,
by the appointment of Special Committees, and by the action of individual members,
has greatly assisted the scientific treatment of steamship design. Valuable con-
tributions bearing on the resistance offered by water to the motion of ships, the
conduct and analysis of the results of steamship trials, the efficiency of propellers,

and cognate subjects have been published in the Reports of the Association. Many
of these have largely influenced practice, and most of them may be claimed as the
work of this Section.

     On this occasion no attempt will be made either to summarise or appraise the
work that has been done. It must suffice to mention the names of three men to

--whom naval architects are deeply indebted, and whose labours are ended Scott

Russell, Rankine, and William Froude. Each of them did good work, but to
Froude we owe the device and application of the method of model experiment
with ships and propellers, by means of which the design of vessels of novel types
and unprecedented speeds can now be undertaken with greater confidence than

heretofore.

     As speeds increase, each succeeding step in the ascending scale becomes more

difficult, and the rate of increase in the power to be developed rapidly augments.
Looking back on what has been achieved, it is impossible to overrate the courage

and skill displayed by the pioneers of steam navigation, who had at first to face

the unknown, and always to depend almost entirely on experience gained with
actual ships, when they undertook the production of swifter vessels. Their suc-
cessors of the present day have equal need to make a thorough study of the
performances of steamships both in smooth water and at sea. In many ways they
have to face greater difficulties than their predecessors, as ships increase in size

and speed. On the otber hand, they have the accumulated experience of sixty

years to draw upon, the benefit of improved methods of trials of steamships, the
advantage of scientific procedure in the record and analysis of such trials, and the
assistance of model experiments.

838 REPORT-- 1899.

     Steamsliip design to be successful must always he based on experiment and
experience as well as on scientific principles and processes. It involves problems
of endless variety and great complexity. The services to be performed by steam-
ships difl'er in character, and demand the production of many distinct types of

--ships and propelling apparatus. In all these types, however, there is one common

requirement the attainment of a specified speed. And in all types there has been

a continuous demand for higher speed.
     Stated broadly, the task set before the naval architect in the design of any

steamship is to fulfil certain conditions of speed in a ship which shall not merely
carry fuel sufficient to traverse a specified distance at that speed, but which shall
carry a specified load on a limited draught of water. Speed, load, power, and fuel
supply are all related ; the two last have to be determined in each case. In
some instances other limiting conditions are imposed affecting length, breadth, or
depth. In all cases there are three separate efiiciencies to be considered : those of
the ship, as influenced by her form ; of the propelling apparatus, including the
generation of steam in the boilers and its utilisation in the engines ; and of the
propellers. Besides these considerations, the designer has to take account of the
materials and structural arrangements which will best secure the association of

lightness with strength in the hull of the vessel. He must select those types of

engines and boilers best adapted for the service proposed. Here the choice must

be influenced by the length of the voyage, as well as the exposure it may involve

to storm and stress. Obviously the conditions to be fulfilled in an ocean-going
passenger steamer of the highest speed, and in a cross-Channel steamer designed
to make short runs at high speed in comparatively sheltered waters, must be

radically different. And so must be the conditions in a swift sea-going cruiser of

large size and great coal endurance, from those best adapted for a torpedo boat or
destroyer. There is, in fact, no general rule applicable to all classes of steamships :
each must be considered and dealt with independently, in the light of the latest

--experience and improvements. For merchant ships there is always the commercial

consideration Will it pay ? For warships there is the corresponding inquiry
Will the cost be justified by the fighting power and efficiency ?

Characteristics of Progress in- Steam Navigation.

    Looking at the results so far attained, it may be said that progress in steam

navigation has been marked by the following characteristics:

1. Growth in dimensions and weights of ships, and large increase in engine-

power, as speeds have been raised.

2. Improvements in marine engineering accompanying increase of steam

pressure. Economy of fuel and reduction in the weight of propelling apparatus

in proportion to the power developed.

3. Improvements in the materials used in shipbuilding; better structural

arrangements                                                        relatively lighter bulls  and larger carrying  power.
                                                                 ;

4. Improvements in form, leading to diminished resistance and economy of

power expended in propulsion.

   --These general statements represent well-known facts so familiar, indeed, that

their full significance is often overlooked. It would be easy to multiply illustra-
tions, but only a few representative cases will be taken.

                                  Transatlantic Passenger Steamers.

     The Transatlantic service naturally comes first. It is a simple case, in that
the distance to be covered has remained practically the same, and that for most of

the swift passenger steamers cargo-carrying capacity is not a very important factor
in the design.

     In 1840 the Canard steamship Britannia, built of wood, propelled by paddle-
wheels, maintained a sea-speed of about 8i knots. Her steam pressure was 12 lbs.
per square inch. She was 207 feet long, about 2,000 tons in displacement, her
               TRANSACTIONS OF SKCTlON G.                       839

engines developed about 750-horse power, and her coal consumption was about
40 tons per day, nearly 5 lbs. of coal per indicated horse-power per hour. tShe

had a full spread of sail.

     In 1871 the White Star steamship Ocenmc (first of that name) occupied a lead-

ing position. She was iron-built, propelled by a screw, and maintained a sea-speed
of"about 14^ knots. The steam pressure was 65 lbs. per square inch, and the
engines were on the compound principle. She was 420 feet long, about 7,200 tons
in displacement, her engines developed 3,000-horse power, and she burnt about
65 tons of coal per day, or about 2 lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour. She

carried a considerable spread of sail.

     In 1889 the White Star steamer Teutonic appeared, propelled by twin screws
and practically with no sail-power. She is steel-built, and maintains a
sea-speed of about 20 knots. The steam pressure is 180 lbs. per square^inch,
and the engines are on the triple expansion principle. She ia about 565 feet
long, 16,000 tons displacement, 17,000-horse power indicated, with a coal con-

sumption of about oOO tons a day, or from 1-6 to 1-7 lbs. per indicated horse-

power per hour.
     In 1894 the Ounard steamship Ca7npmiia began her service, with triple expan-

sion engines, twin screws, and no sail-power. She is about 600 feet long, 20,000
tons displacement, develops about 28,000- horse power at full speed of 22 knots,

and burns about 500 tons of coal per day.

    The new Oceanic, of the White Star Line, is just beginning her work. She is

of still larger dimensions, being 685 feet in length and over 25,000 tons displace-

ment. From the authoritative statements made, it appears that she is not intended

to exceed 22 knots in speed, and that the increase in size is to be largely utilised

in additional carrying power.

   AThe latest German steamers for the Transatlantic service are also notable.

speed of 22i knots has been maintained by the Kaiser Wilheim der ryrosse, which

is 25 feet longer than the Campania. Two still larger steamers are now building.

The Deutschland is 660 feet long and 23,000 tons displacement ; her engines are
to be of 33,000-horse power, and it is estimated she will average 23 knots. The

other vessel is said to be 700 feet long, and her engines are to develop 36,000-
horse power, giving an estimated speed of 23i knots. All these vessels have steel
hulls and twin screws. It will be noted that to gain about three knots an hour

nearly 50 per cent, will have been added to the displacement of the Teutonic, the

engine-power and coal consumption will be doubled, and the cost increased pro-

portionately.

Sixty years of continuous effort and strenuous competition on this great ' ocean

ferry ' may be summarised in the following statement. Speed has been increased

from 8i to 22i^ knots: the time on the voyage has been reduced to about 38 per
cent, of what it was in 1840. Ships have been more than trebled in len^^th, about

doubled in breadth, and increased tenfold in displacement. The number of

passengers carried by a steamship has been increased from about 100 to nearly

2,000. The engine-power has been made forty times as great. The ratio of

horse-power to the weight driven has been increased fourfold. The rate of coal

consumption (measured per horse-power per hour) is now only about one-third

what it was in 1840. To drive 2,000 tons weight across the Atlantic at a speed

of Qh knots, about 550 tons of coal were then burnt : now, to drive 20,000 tons

across at 22 knots, about 3,000 tons of coal are burnt. "With the low pressure of

steam and heavy slow-moving paddle-engines of 1840,  each  ton  weight of
                                                                                                         ^

machinery, boilers, &c., produced only about 2-hor.=e power for continuous working

at sea. "With modern twin-screw engines and high steam pressure, each ton

weight of propelling apparatus produces from 6- to 7-horse power. Had the

old rate of coal consumption continued, instead of 3,000 tons of coal, 9,000 tons

would have been required for a voyage at 22 knots. Had the engines been pro-

portionately as heavy as those in tise sixty years ago, they would have weighed

about 14,000 tons, 'in other words, machinery, boilers, and coals would have

exceeded in weight the total weight of the Campania as she floats to-day. There

could not be a more striking illustration than this of the close relation between
840 KEPORT-- 1899.

improvements in marine engineering and the development of steam navigation at
high speeds.

     Equally true is it that this development could not have been accomplished but

for the use of improved materials and structural arrangements. Wood, as the

principal material for the hulls of high-powered swift steamers, imposed limits
upon dimensions, proportions, and powers which would have been a bar to progress.
The use of iron, and later of stenl, removed those limits. The percentage of the
total displacement devoted to hull in a modern Atlantic liner of the largest size

is not much greater than was the corresponding percentage in the wood-built

Britannia of 1840, of one-third the length and one-tenth the total weight.
     Nor must it be overlooked that with increase in dimensions have come con-

siderable improvements mfoi-m, favouring economy in propulsion. This is distinct
from the economy resulting from increase in size, which Brunei appreciated
thoroughly half a century ago when he designed the Great Britain and the Great
Eastern. The importance of a due relation between the lengths of the ' entrance

and run ' of steamships and their intended maximum speeds, and the advantages of

greater length and fineness of form as speeds are increased, were strongly insisted

upon by Scott Russell and Froude. Naval architects, as a matter of course, now

act upon the principle, so far as other conditions permit. For it must never be

forgotten that economy of propulsion is only one of many desiderata which must

be kept in view in steamship design. Structural weight and strength, seaworthi-

ness and stability, all claim attention, and may necessitate modifications in dimen-
sions and form which do not favour the maximum economy of propulsion.

                    Swift Passenger Steamers for Long Voyages.

     Changes similar to those described for the Transatlantic service have been

in progress on all the great lines of ocean traffic. In many instances increase in

size has been due not only to increase in speed, but to enlarged carrying power

and the extension of the lengths of voyages. No distance is now found too great

for the successful working of steamships, and the sailing fleet is rapidly diminish-
ing in importance. So far as long-distance steaming is concerned, the most potent
factor has undoubtedly been the marvellous economy of fuel that has resulted from
higher steam pressures and greater expansion. In all cases, however, advances
have been made possible not merely by economy of fuel, but by improvements iu
form, structure, and propelling apparatus, and hy increased dimensions.

     Did timw permit, this might be illustrated by many interesting facts drawn

from the records of the great steamship companies which perform the services to

the Far East, Australia, South America, and the Pacific. As this is not possible,

I must be content with a brief statement regarding the development of the fleet of
the Peninsular and Oriental Company.

     The paddle steamer William Faiccett of 1829 was about 75 feet long, 200 tons
displacement, of 60 nominal horse-power (probably about 120 indicated horse-
power), and in favourable weather steamed at a speed of 8 knots. Her hull was
oi' wood, and, like all the steamers of that date, she had considerable sail-power.

     In 18'"i3 the Ilimalat/a irou-built screw steamer nf this line was described as
' of larger dimensions than any then afloat, and of extraordinary speed.' She was
about o40 leet long, over 4,000 tons load displacement, 2,000 indicated horse-
power on trial, with an average sea-speed of about 12 knots. The steam pressure
was 14 lbs. per square inch, and the daily coal consumption about 70 tons. This
vessel was trausferrtd to the Royal Navy aud did good service as a troopship for

furty years.

     In 1893 another Himalaya was added to the company's fleet. She was steel-
built, nearly 470 feet 1 ng and 12,000 tons load displacement, with over 8,000
indicated horse-power and a capability to sustain 17 to 18 knots at .sea, on a daily
(·(insuniption of about 140 tons of coal. The steam pressure is 160 lbs. per square

inch, and the engines are of the ti'iple expansion type.
     Comparing the two Hitnalayas, it will be seen that in forty years the length

has been increased about 40 per cent., displacement trebled, horse-power qua-
                                                                                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                   841

drupled, and speed increased about 50 per cent. The proportion of horse-power to

displacement has only been increased as three to four, enlarged dimensions having

secured relative economy in propulsion. The rate of coal consumption has been

probably reduced to about one-third of that in the earlier ship.

The latest steamers of the line are of still larger dimensions, being 500 feet

long and of proportionately greater displacement. It is stated that the Himalaya

of 1853 cost 132,000/. complete for sea ; the corresponding outlay on her successors
is not published, but it is probably twice as great.

On the service to the Cape similar developments have taken place. Forty

years ago vessels less than 200 feet long and about 7 knots performed the service,

whereas the latest additions to the fleets exceed 500 feet in length, and can, if

required, be driven at 17 to 18 knots, ranking iu size and power next to the great

Transatlantic liners.

Commercial considerations necessarily regulate what is undertaken in the

construction of merchant steamers, including the swift vessels employed in the

conveyance of passengers and mails. The investment of 600,000/. to 700,000/. in

a single vessel like a great Transatlantic liner is obviously a serious matter for

private owners                                                                         and even the investment of half that amount in a steamer of  less
                                                                                    ;

dimensions and speed is not to be lightly undertaken. It is a significant fact that,

whereas fifteen years ago nearly all the largest and swiftest ocean steamers were

British built and owned, at the present time there is serious competition in this

class by German, American, and French companies. It is alleged that this change

has resulted from the relatively large subsidies paid by foreign Governments to the

owners of swift steamers ; and that British owners, being handicapped in this way,

cannot continue the competition in size and speed on equal terms unless similarly

assisted. This is not the place to enter into any discussion of such matters, but

they obviously involve greater considerations than the profit of shipowners, and

have a bearing on the naval defence of the Empire. In 1887 the Government

recognised this fact, and made arrangements for the subvention and armament of

a number of the best mercantile steamships for use as auxiliary cruisers. Since

then other nations have adopted the policy, and given such encouragement to their

shipowners that the numbers of swift steamers suitable for employment as cruisers

have been largely increased. Not long since the First Lord of the Admiralty

announced to Parliament that the whole subject was again under consideration.

                                                                                       Cargo and Passenger Steamers.

Cargo steamers, no less than passenger steamers, have been affected by the

improvements mentioned. Remarkable developments have occurred recently not

merely in the purely cargo-carrier, but in the construction of vessels of large size

and good speed carrying very great weights of cargo and considerable numbers of

passengers. The much-decried ' ocean tramp ' of the present day exceeds in speed

the passenger and mail steamer of fifty years ago. Within ten years vessels

in which cargo-carrying is the chief element of commercial success have been

increased in length from 300 or 400 feet to 500 or 600 feet ; in gross register

tonnage from 5,000 to                                                                  over  13,000  tons                     and in speed from 10 or 12 knots to 15
                                                                                                                           ;

or 16 knots. Vessels are now building for the Atlantic service which can carry

12,000 to 13,000 tons deadweight, in addition to passengers, while possessing a

sea-speed as high as that of the swiftest mail steamers afloat in 1880. Other

vessels of large carrying power and good speed are running on much longer

voyages, such as to the Cape and Australia. In order to work these ships success-

fully very complete organisation is necessary for the collection, embarcation, and

discharge of cargo. The enterprise and skill of shipowners have proved equal to

this new departure, as they have in all other developments of steamships.

    How much further progress will be made in the sizes and speeds of these

mixed cargo and passenger steamers cannot be foreseen. The limits will be fixed

by commercial considerations, and not by the capability of the shipbuilder.

In passing, it may be noted that while the lengths and breadths of steamships

have been greatly increased, there has been but a moderate increase in draught.
842 REPORT--1899.

Draught of water is, of course, practically determined by the depths available in
the ports and docks frequented, or in the Suez Canal for vessels trading to the
East. From the naval architect's point of view, increase in draught is most desi-
rable as favouring increase of carrying power and economy of propulsion. This
fact has been strongly represented by shipowners and ship-designers, and not with-
out result. The responsible authorities of many of the principal ports and of the
Suez Canal have taken action towards giving greater depth.

     Other changes have become necessary on the part of dock and port authorities
in consequence of the progress made in shipbuilding. Docks and dock-entrances
have had to be increased in size, more powerful lilting appliances provided, and
large expenditure incurred. There is no escape from these changes if the trade of
a port is to be maintained. The chief lesson to be learnt from past experience is
that when works of this character are planned it is wise to provide a large margin
beyond the requirements of existing ships.

                    Cross-Channel Steamers.

The conditions to be fulfilled in vessels designed to steam at high speed

for limited periods differ essentially from those holding good in ocean-going
steamers. None the less interest attaches, however, to cross-Channel steamers, and

in no class has more notable progress been made. It is much to be desired that at

this meeting some competent authority should have presented to the Association

an epitome of the history of the steam packet service between Dover and the

Continent. I cannot attempt it. So far as I am informed, the first steamer was

placed on this route in 1821, was of 90 tons burden, 30-horse power nominal, and
maintained a speed of 7 to 8 knots. She was built by Denny of Dumbarton,
engined by David Napier, and named the Rob Roy. It is interesting to note that

the lineal successors of the builder of this pioneer vessel have produced some of

the most recent and swiftest additions to the cross-Channel service.
     In 1861-2 a notable advance was made by the building of vessels which were

then remarkable for structure and speed, although small and slow when compared
with vessels now running. Their designers realised that lightness of hull was of

supreme importance, and with great trouble and expense obtained steel of suitable

quality. The machinery was of special design and relatively light for the power

Adeveloped.  small weight of coal and cargo had to be carried, ajid the draught

of water was kept to about 7 feet. Under then existing conditions it was a

veritable triumph to attain speeds of 15 to 16 knots in vessels only 190 feet long,
less than 25 feet broad, and under 350 tons in displacement. To raise the trial

speed to 20 or 21 knots in later vessels performing the same service, whose design

includes the improvements of a quarter of a century, it has been found necessary

to adopt lengths exceeding 320 feet and breadths of about 35 feet, with engines

developing 4,500 to 6,000 indicated horse-power, and with very great increase in

coal consumption and cost. On other cross-Channel services between Dover and

the Continent still larger and more powerful paddle-steamers are employed.

    Another interesting contrast is to be found in the comparison of the steamers
running between Holyhead and Kingstown in 1860 and at the present time. The

Leinster of 1860 was 328 feet lung, 35 feet broad, and rather less than 13 feet draught.

Her trial displacement was under 2,000 tons, and with 4,750 horse-power she made

17| knots. She had a steam pressure of 25 lbs. per square inch; and was propelled
by paddle wheels driven by slow-moving engines of long stroke. Her successor of

1896 is about 30 feet greater length, 6^- feet greater breadth, and about 10 per
cent, greater displacement. The steam pressure is 170 lbs. per square inch. Forced
draught is used in the stokeholds. Twin screws are adopted, driven by quick-
running vertical engines of the triple expansion type. Very great economy of

coal consumption is thus secured as compared with the earlier vessel, and much

lighter propelling apparatus in proportion to the power, which is from 8,000- to 9,000-
horse power at the full speed of 23 knots. The hull is built of steel, and is propor-

tionately lighter.

This is a typical case, and illustrates the elTect of improvements in shipbuilding
TRANSAQTlONS OP SECTION G.  843

and eDgineerliig in thirty-five yeavs. The later ship probably requires to carry no

greater load of coal than, if so great as, her predecessor, although her engine-

power is nearly double. The weight devoted to propelling machniery and boilers
is probably not so great. Thanks to the use of steel instead of iron, and to
improved structural arrangements, the weight of hull is reduced in comparison
with dimensions, and a longer ship is produced better adapted to the higher speed.
Messrs. Laird of Birkenhead, who built three of the Leinster class forty years ago,
and have built all the new vessels, are to be congratulated on their complete

success.

     Between such vessels designed for short runs at high speed and requirmg
therefore to carry little coal, while the load carried exclusive of coal is trifling, and
an ocean-going steamer of the same average speed designed to make passages of
3,000 miles, there can obviously be little in common. But equal technical skill is
required to secure the efficient performance of both services. In the cross-Channel
vessel, running from port to port, and under constant observation, conditions of

working in engine and boiler rooms, as well as relative lightness in scantlings of
hull, can be accepted, which would be impossible of application in a sea-going ship.
These circumstances in association with the small load carried explain the apparent

gain in speed of the smaller vessel in relation to her dimensions.

                      Increase in Size and SjJeed of Warshi^JS.

     Turning from sea-going ships of the mercantile marine to warships, one finds
equally notable facts in regard to increase in speed, associated with enlargement
in dimensions and advance in propelling apparatus, materials of construction,

structural arrangements, and form.

    Up to 1860 a measured-mile speed of 12 to 13 knots was considered sufficient

for battleships and the largest classes of cruisers. All these vessels possessed good

sail-power and used it freely as an auxiliary to steam, or as an alternative when

cruising or milking passages.

    When armoured battleships were built (1859) the speeds on measured-mile

trials were raised to 14 or 14i knots, and so remained for about twenty years.
Since 1880 the speeds of battleships have been gradually increased, and in the

latest types the measured-mile speed required is ll» knots.

    Up to 1870 the corresponding speeds in cruisers ranged from 15 to 16 knots.
Ten years later the maximum speeds were 18 to 18^ knots in a few vessels.

Since then trial speeds of 20 to 23 knots have been attained or are contemplated.
      There is, of course, a radical distinction between these measured-mile perform-

ances of warships and the average sea-speeds of merchant steamers above described.
But for purposes of comparison between warships of different dates, measured

mile trials may fairly be taken as the standard. For long-distance steaming the
power developed would necessarily be much below that obtained for short periods,
 and with everything at its best. This is frankly recognised by all who are con-

 versant with the warship design, and fully allowed for in estimates of sea-speeds.

On the other hand, it is possible to point to sea trials made with recent types

 ·where relatively high speeds have been maintained for long periods. For example,
 the battleship Royal Sovereign has maintained an average speed of J 5 knots from
 Plymouth to Gibraltar, and the Menotcn has maintained an equal speed from

 Bermuda to Spithead. As instances of good steaming by cruisers, reference may
 be made to 60-hour trials with the Terrible when she averaged over 20 knots, and
 to the run home from Gibraltar to the Nore by the Diadem when she exceeded
 19 knots. Vessels of the Pelorus class of only 2,100 tons displacement have made

 long runs at sea averaging over 17 knots. Results such as these represent a sub-

 stantial advance in speed of Her Majesty's ships in recent years.
      Similar progress has been made in foreign warships built abroad as well as in this

 country. It is not proposed to give any (acts for these vessels, or to compare
 them with results obtained by similar classes of ships in the Royal Navy. Apart
 from full knowledge of the conditions imder which speed trials are made, a
 mere statement of speeds attained is of no service. One requires to be informed
                                           -

--su REPORT 1899,

accurately respecting the duration of the trial, the manner la which engines and
boilers are worked, the extent to which boilers are ' forced,' or the proportion
of heating surface to power indicated, the care taken to eliminate the influence of
tide or current, the mode in which the observations of speed are made, and other
details, before any fair or exact comparison is possible between ships. For present
purposes, therefore, it is preferable to confine the illustrations of increase in speed
in warships to results obtained under Admiralty conditions, and which are fairly

comparable.

   A great increase in size has accompanied this increase in speed, but it has

resulted from other changes in modern types, as well as from the rise in speed.
Modern battleships are of 13,000 to 15,000 tons, and modern cruisers of 10,000 to
14,000 tons, not merely because they are faster than their predecessors, but because
they have greater powers of offence and defence and possess greater coal endurance.
Only a detailed analysis, which cannot now be attempted, could show what is the

actual influence of these several changes upon size and cost, and how greatly the
improvements made in marine engineering and shipbuilding have tended to keep
down the growth in dimensions consequent on increase in load carried, speed

attained, and distance traversed.

    It will be noted also that, large as are the dimensions of many classes of modern

warships, they are all smaller in length and displacement than the largest mercan-
tile steamers above described. There is no doubt a popular belief that the con-
trary is true, and that warships exceed merchant ships in tonnage This arises
from the fact that merchant ships are ordinarily described not by their displace-
ment tonnage, but by their ' registered tonnage,' which is far less than their dis-

placement. As a matter of fact, the largest battleships are only of about two- thirds

the displacement of the largest passenger steamers, and from 200 to 300 feet
shorter. The largest cruisers are from 100 to 200 feet shorter than the largest
passenger steamers, and about 60 per cent, of their displacement. In breadth the
warships exceed the largest merchant steamers by 5 to 10 feet. This difference in
form and proportions is the result of radical diiierences in the vertical distribution
of weights carried, and is essential to the proper stability of the warships. Here

we find an illustration of the general principle underlying all ship-designing. In
selecting the forms and proportions of a new ship, considerations of economical
propulsion cannot stand alone. They must be associated with other considerations,

such as stability, protection, and manceuvring power, and in the final result

economy of propulsion may have to be sacrificed, to some extent, in order to secure

other essential qualities.

                              Advantages of Increased Dimensions.

    Before passing on, it may be interesting to illustrate the gain in economy of

propulsion resulting from increase in dimensions by means of the following table,

--which gives particulars of a number of typical cruisers, all of comparatively recent

design :

20 knots is only increased about 26 times. If the same types of engines and

--boilers bad been adopted in these two vessels which was not the case, of course

the weights of propelling apparatus and coal for a given distance would have been
proportional to the respective powers ; that is to say, the larger vessel would have
been equipped with only 2-6 times the weight carried by the smaller. On the
other hand, roughly speaking, the dispomble jcciffhts, after providing for hulls and
iittings in these two vessels, might be considered to be proportional to their dis-

placements. As a matter of fact, this assumption is distinctly in favour of the

smaller ship. Adopting it, the larger vessel would have about ei(//it times the
disposable weight of the smaller; while the demand for propelling apparatus and
fuel would be only 2 times that of the smaller vessel. There would therefore be
an enormous margin of carrying power in comparison with displacement in the
larger vessel. This might be devoted, and in fact was devoted, partly to the attain-

ment of a speed considerably exceeding 20 knots (which was a maximum for the

smaller vessel), partly to increased coal endurance, and partly to protection and

armament.

     Another interesting comparison may be made between vessels Nos. 4 and 5 in

the preceding table, by tracing the growth in power necessary to drive the vessels

at speeds ranging from 10 knots up to 22 knots.

the attainment of extraordinarily high speeds, for short periods and in smooth
·water, by vessels of small dimensions. Their qualities and performances, therefore,
merit examination.

     Mr. Thornycroft may justly he considered the pioneer in this class of work.

Greatly impressed by the combination of lightness and power embodied in railway
locomotives, Mr. Thornycroft applied similar principles to the propulsion of small
boats, and obtained remarkably high speeds. His work became more widely

known when the results were published of a series of trials, conducted in 1872 by
Sir Frederick Bramwell on a small vessel named the Miranda. She was only
45 feet long and weighed 4 tons, yet she exceeded 16 knots on trial. The
Norwegian torpedo boat built in 1873 was 67 feet long, 1\ tons, and of
15 knots ; the lirst English torpedo boat of 1877 was 81 feet long, 29 tons, and

attained 18^ knots.

     Mr. Yarrow also undertook the construction of small swift vessels at a very
early date, and has greatly distinguished himself throughout the development of
the torpedo flotilla. Messrs. White, of Cowes, previously well known as builders
of steamboats fur use on board ships, extended their operations to the construction

of torpedo boats. These three firms for a considerable time practically monopolised
this special class of work in this country. Abroad they had able competitors in

Normand in France, Schichau in Germany, and Herreshoif in the United States.
Keen competition led to successive improvements and rapid rise in speed. During
the last six years the demand for a fleet of about 100 destroyers, to be built

in the shortest possible time, involved the necessity for increasing the sources

of supply. At the invitation of the Admiraltj', a considerable number of the

leading shipbuilding and engineering firms have undertaken and successfully
carried through the construction of destroyers varying from 26 to 33 knots in

speed, although the work was necessarily of a novel character, involving many

difficulties.

    As the speeds of torpedo vessels have risen, so have their dimensions increased.
"Within the class the law shown to hold good in larger vessels applies equally.

In 1877 a first-class torpedo boat was 81 feet long, under 30 tons weight, developed
400 horse-power, and steamed 18i- knots. Ten years later the corresponding class
of boat was 135 feet long, 125 tons weight, developed 1,500 horse-power, and
steamed 23 knots. In 1897 it had grown to 150 feet in length, 140 to 150 tons,
2,000 horse-power, and 26 knots.

     Destroyers are not yet of seven years' standing, but they come under the rule.
The first examples (1893) were 180 feet long, 240 tons, 4,000 horse-power, and
26 to 27 k-nots. They were followed by 30-knot vessels, 200 to 210 feet long, 280
to 300 tons, 5,500 to 6,000 horse-power. Vessels now in construction are to
attain 32 to 33 knots, their lengths being about 230 feet, displacements 360 to 380
tons, and engine-power 8,000 to 10,000 horse-power.

     Cost has gone up with size and power, and the limit of progress in this direction
will probably be fixed by financial considerations, rather than by constructive
difficulties, great as these become as speeds rise.

    It may be interesting to summarise the distinctive features of torpedo-vessel

design.

    1. The propelling apparatus is excessively light in proportion to the maximum
power developed. Water-tube boilers are now universally adopted, and on speed
trials they are ' forced ' to a considerable extent. High steam pressures are used.

--The engines are run at a high rate of revolution often at 400 revolutions per

minute. Great care is taken in every detail to economise weight. Speed trials at

maximum power only extend over three hours. On such trials in a destroyer each

ton weight of propelling apparatus produces about 45 indicated horse-power.
Some idea of the relative lightness of the destroyer's machinery and boilers will be

obtained when it is stated that in a large modern cruiser with water-tube boilers,
high steam pressure, and quick-running engines, the maximum power obtained on an

eight hours' trial corresponds to about 12 indicated horse-power per ton of engines,
boilers, &c. That is to say, the proportion of power to weight of propelling
apparatus is from three and a half to four times as great in the destroyer as it is in
the cruiser.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                                                                                                                                                         847

    A2. very large percentage of the total weight (or displacement) of a torpedo

vessel is assigned to propelling apparatus. In a destroyer of 30 knots trial-speed,
nearly one-half the total weight is devoted to machinery, boilers, &c. In the
swiftest cruisers of large size the corresponding allocation of weight is less than
20 per cent, of the displacement, and in the largest and fastest mail steamers it is
about 20 to 25 per cent.

      3. The torpedo vessel carries a relatively small load of fuel, equipment, &c.
Taking a 30-knot destroyer, for example, the speed trials are made with a load not
exceeding 12 to 14 per cent, of the displacement. In a swift cruiser the corre-
sponding load would be from 40 to 45 per cent., or proportionately more than

three times as great. What this difference means may be illustrated by two

statements. If the load in a destroyer were trebled and the vessel correspondingly

increased in draught and weight, the speed attained with the same maximum

power would be about three knots less. If, on the other hand, the vessel were
designed to attain 30 knots on trial with the heavier load, her displacement
would probably be increased about 70 to 80 per cent.

     4. The hull and fittings of the torpedo vessel are exceedingly light in relation
to the dimenBions and engine-power. For many parts of the structure steel of
high tensile strength is used. Throughout, the utmost care is taken to economise
weight. In small vessels, for special service, many conditions can be accepted
which would be inadmissible in larger sea-going vessels. The result of all this
care is the production of hull-structures having ample general strength for their

special service. Lightness of scantling, of course, involves small local strength
against collision, grounding, and other accident. Experience proves, however,
that this involves no serious risk or difficulty.

      These conditions are essential to the attainment of very high speeds for short
periods. They resemble the conditions ruling the design of cross-Channel steamers,
so far as relative lightness of propelling apparatus, small load, and light scantlings
are concerned. The essential differences lie in the requirements for passenger
accommodation as compared with the requirements for armament of the torpedo

vessel. No one has yet proposed to extend the torpedo-vessel system to sea-going

ships of large dimensions. Very similar conditions for the propelling apparatus
have been accepted in a few cruisers of considerable dimensions, wherein high
speeds for short periods were required. It is, however, unquestionable that in
many ways, and particularly in regard to machinery design, the construction of
torpedo vessels has greatly influenced that of larger ships.

     One important consideration must not be overlooked. For short-distance
steaming at high speeds economy in coal consumption is of little practical
importance, and it is all-important to secure lightness of propelling apparatus in
relation to power. For long-distance steaming, on the contrary, economy in coal
consumption is of primary importance ; and savings in weight of propelling

apparatus, even of considerable amount, may be undesirable if they involve

increased coal consumption. Differences of opinion prevail as to the real economy
of fuel obtainable with boilers and engines such as are fitted in torpedo vessels.
Claims are made for some vessels which represent remarkable economy. Only

enlarged experience can settle these questions.
     Endurance is also an important quality in sea-going ships of large size, not

merely in structures, but in propelling apparatus. The extreme lightness essential
in torpedo vessels obviously does not favour endurance if high powers are frequently

or continuously required. Still, it cannot be denied that the results obtained in

torpedo vessels show such a wide departure from those usual in sea-going ships as
to suggest the possibility of some intermediate type of propelling apparatus
applicable to large sea-going ships and securing sufficient durability and economy

of fuel in association with further savings of weight.

The Parsons Turbo-Motor.

The steam turbo-motor introduced by Mr. Charles Parsons is to be described

by the inventor during these meetings                                                                                                                                                    but it is impossible for  me to pass it over

in this review without a brief notice. This rotary engine, with its very high rate

of revolution, reduces the weights of machinery, shafting, and propellers greatly

below the weight required in the quickest-running engines cf the reciprocatin"

type. This reduction in the proportion of weight to power carries with it, of

course, the possibility of higher speed in a vessel of given dimensions; and when

Anlarge powers are employed the absolute gain is very great.                                   illustration of this

has been given by Mr. Parsons in the Twhinia. That remarkable vessel is

ICO feet long and of 44i tons displacement, but she has attained 33 to 34- knots in

short runs. There are three shafts, each carrying three screw propellers, each

shaft driven by a steam turbine making over 2,000 revolutions at full speed, when
Amore than 2,000 horse-power is developed.
                                                                    water-tube boiler of special design

supplies steam of 175 lbs. pressure, and is exceptionally light for the steam

produced, being highly forced. The whole weight of machinery and boilers is

22 tons: in other words, about 100 horse-power (indicated) is produced for each

ton weight of propelling apparatus. This is rather more than twice the proportion

of power to weight as compared with the lightest machinery and boilers fitted in

torpedo boats and destroyers. It will be noted that in the Turbinia, as in the

destroyers, about                             half the total weight is devoted to propelling   apparatus                                          and in
                                                                                                                                               ;

both instances tlie load carried is relatively small. The secret of the extra-

ordinary speed is to be found in the extreme lightness of propelling apparatus, and

small load.

No doubt in the Turbinia lightness has been pushed further than it would be in

vessels of larger size and greater power. In such vessels a lower rate of revolution

would probably be accepted, additional motors would be fitted for manoeuvring

and going astern, boilers of relatively greater weight would be adopted, and

other changes made. But, after making ample allowance for all such increases in

weight, it is unquestionable that considerable economies must be possible with

rotary engines. Two other vessels of the destroyer type with turbo-motors (one

for the Royal Navy) are now approaching completion. Their trials will be of

great interest, as they will furnish a direct comparison with vessels of similar size

and form, fitted with similar boilers and driven by reciprocatmg engines.

On the side of coal consumption Mr. Parsons claims at least equality with the

best triple expansion engines. Into the other advantages attending the use of

rotary engines it is not necessary now to enter.

Reference must be made, however, to one matter in which Mr. Parsons has

done valuable and original work. In torpedo vessels of high speed the choice of

the most efficient propellers has always been a matter of difficulty, and the solution

of the problem has in many instances involved extensive experimental trials. By

means of alterations in propellers alone, very large increases in speed have been

effected and                                  even  now there  are  difficulties to be faced.  When Mr. Parsons
                                           ;

went far beyond all experience and precedent and had to face unknown conditions.

lie has found the solution, after much patient and original investigation, in the

use of multiple screws of small diameter. His results in this direction are of

general interest to all who have to deal with screw propulsion.

Such radical changes in propelling machinery as are involved in the adoption

of turbo-motors must necessarily be subjected to thorough test before they will be

widely adopted. The experiment which the Admiralty are making is not on a

small scale as regards power. Although it is made in a destroyer, about 10,000-

borse-power will probably be developed and a correspondingly high speed

attained. It may well happen that from this experiment very far-reaching effects
may follow. Mr. Parsons himself has prepared many designs illustrating various

applications of the system to sea-going, cross-Channel, and special service vessels.

Where shallowness of draught is unavoidable the small diameter of the screws

possible with the quick-running turbines is clearly an important matter.

                    Comparisons between Large and Small Vessels.

     It has been shown that the attainment of very high speeds by vessels of small

size involves many conditions not applicable to large sea-going steamships. But
      TRA^'SACTtONS OP SEOTION G.                                                                                                                               849

it is equally true that in many ways the trials of small swift vessels constitute
model experiments from which interesting information may be obtained as to what
would bo involved in driving ships of large size at speeds much exceeding any of

which we have experience. When the progressive steam-trials of such small

vessels can bo studied side by side with experiments made on models to determine

their resistance at various speeds, then the fullest information is obtained and the

best guide to progress secured. This advantage, as has been said, we owe to

William I'roude.

     His contributions to the Reports of the British Association are classics in the
literature of the resistance and propulsion of ships. In 1874 he practically

exhau.sted the subject of frictional resistance so far as it is known; and his

Presidential Address to this Section in lS7o dealt fully and lucidly with the

modern or stream-line theory of resistance. No doubt there would be advantage

in extending Froude's experiments on frictional resistance to greater lengths and

to ship-shaped forms. It is probable also thatdynamometric determinations of the

resistance experienced by ships of modern forms and considerable size when towed

at various speeds would be of value if they could be conducted. These extensions

of what Froude accomplished are not easily carried out; and in this country the

pressure of work on shipbuilding for the Royal Navy has, for many years past,

taxed to the utmost limits the capacity of the Admiralty experimental establish-

ment so ably superintended by Mr. R. E. Froude, allowing little scope for purely

scientitic investigations, and making it difficult to deal with the numerous experi-

Nowments incidental to the designs of actual ships.  that Holland, Russia, Italy,

and the United States have equipped experimental establishments, while Germany

and France are taking steps in that direction, we may hope for extensions of purely-

scientific work and additions to our knowledge. In this direction, however, I am

bound to say that much might be done if experimental establishments capable of

dealing with questions of a general nature relating to resistance and propulsion

were added to the equipment of some of our universities and colleges. En"-ineer-

ing laboratories have been multiplied, but there is as yet no example of a model

experimental tank, devoted to instruction and research.

     It is impossible, and possibly is unnecessary, to attempt in this Address any

account of Froude's ' scale of comparison' between ships and models at ' correspond-

ing speeds.' But it may be of interpst to give a lew illustrations of the working

of this method, in the form of a contrast between a destroyer of 300 tons, 212 feet

long, capable of steaming 30 knots an hour, and a vessel of similar form enlarged

to 765 feet in length and 14,100 tons. The ratio of dimensions is here about
3G1 : 1 ; the ratio of displacements is 47 : 1 ; and the ratio of corresponding speeds

rOis : 1.

To 12 knots in the small vessel would correspond 22-8 knots in the large

vessel; and the resistance experienced by the large vessel at 22 8 knots fneglecting

a correction for friction) should be forty-seven times that of the small vessel at

12 knots. By experiment, this resistance for the small vessel was i'ound to be

1-8 tons. Hence, for the large vessel at 22-8 knots the resistance should be

84'6 tons. This would correspond to an ' effective horse-power ' of over 13,000, or

to about 26,000 indicated horse-power. The frictional correction would reduce

this to about 25,000 horse-power, or about 1-8 horse-power per ton. Now turninrj

to the destroyer, it is found experimentally that at 22'8 knots she experiences a

resistance of about 11 tons, corresponding to an effective horse-power of over

1,700, and an indicated horse-power of about 3,000 : say 10 horse-power per ton,

or nearly live and a halt' times the power per ton required in the larger vessel.

This illustrates the economy of propulsion arising from increased dimensions.

Applying the same process to a speed of 30 knots in the large ship, the corre-

sponding speed in the small ship is 158 knots. lier resistance at that speed is

experimentally determined to be 3'6 tons, and the resistance of the large ship at

30 knots (neglecting frictional correction) is about 165 tons. The effective horse-

power of the large ship at 30 knots is, therefore, about 34,000, corresponding

to 68,000 horse-power indi'^ated. Allowing for the frictional correction, this would

drop to about 02,000 horse-power, or 4'4 horse-power per ton.                                                                                                   For the destrover

at 30 knots tlie resistance is atout 17^ tons : tlie effective horse-power is 3,600,
and the indicated horse-power about 6,000, or 20 horse-power per ton, nearly five
times as great as the corresponding power for the large ship. But while the
destroyer under her trial conditions actually reaches 30 knots, it is certain that
in the large ship ueitlier weight nor space could be found for machinery and
boilers of the power required for 30 knots, and of the types usually adopted in large
cruisers, in association with an adequate supply of fuel. The explanation of the
methods by which the high speed is reached in the destroyer has already been

given. Her propelling apparatus is about one-fourth as heavy in relation to its
maximum power, and her load is only about one-third as great in relation to the
displacement, when compared with the corresponding features in a swift modern

cruiser.

     It will, of course, be understood that in practice, under existing conditions,
a cruiser of 14,000 tons would not be made 765 feet long, but probably about
500 feet. The hypothetical cruiser has been introduced simply for purposes of

comparison with the destroyer.

The earlier theories of resistance assumed that the resistance experienced by

Weships varied as the square of the speed.                                now know that the frictional resist-

ances of clean-painted surfaces of considerable length vary as the 1'83 power of the

speed. This seems a small difference, but it is sensible in its effects, causing a

reduction of 32 per cent, at 10 knots, nearly 40 per cent, at 20 knots, and 42 per

cent, at 25 knots. On the other hand, it is now known that the laws of variation
of the residual or wave-making resistance may depart very widely from the law of
the square of the speed, and it may be interesting to trace for the typical destroyer
how the I'esistance actually varies.

    Take first the total resistance. Up to 11 knots it varies nearly as the square of

the speed ; at 16 knots it has reached the cube ; from 18 to 20 knots it varies as

the 3"3 power. Then the index begins to diminish : at 22 knots it 27is ; at 25

knots it has fallen to the square, and from thence to 30 knots it varies, practically,

as does the frictional resistance.

     The residual resistance varies as the square of the speed up to 11 knots, as the
cube at 12^ to 13 knots, as the fourth power about 14^ knots, and at a higher rate
than the fifth power at 18 knots. Then the index begins to fall, reaching the

square at 24 knots, and falling still lower at higher speeds.

    It will be seen, therefore, that when this small vessel has been driven up to 24

or 25 Isnots by a large relative expenditure of power, further increments of speed

are obtained with less proportionate additions to the power.

Passing from the destroyer to the cruiser of similar form but of 14,100 tons,

and once more applying the ' scale of comparison,' it will be seen that to 25 knots

in the destroyer corresponds a speed of 47| knots in the large vessel. In other
words, the cruiser would not reach the condition where further increments of speed
are obtained with comparatively moderate additions of power until she exceeded
47 knots, which is an impossible speed for such a vessel under existing conditions.
The highest speeds that could be reached by the cruiser with propelling apparatus

of the lightest type yet fitted in large sea-going ships would correspond to speeds
in the destroyer, for which the resistance is varying as the highest power of the

speed. These are suggestive facts.

     Frictional resistance, as is well known, is a most important matter in all classes

of ships and at all speeds. Even in the typical destroyer this is so. At 12 knots

the friction with clean-painted bottom represents 80 per cent, of the total resist-

ance                          at  16 knots 70 per cent. ;  at 20 knots a  little less  than 50 per cent. ;  and at
                           ;

30 knots 45 per cent. If the coefficient of friction were doubled and the maximum

power developed with equal efficiency, a loss of speed of fully 4 knots would result.

In the cruiser of similar form the friction represents 90 per cent, at 12 knots,

85 per cent, at 16 knots, nearly 80 per cent, at 20 knots, and over 70 per cent, at

23 knots. If the coefficient of friction were doubled at 23 knots and the corre-
sponding power developed with equal efficiency, the loss of speed would approximate

to 4 knots.
     These illustration,s only confirm general experience that clean bottoms are

essential to economical propulsion and the maintenance of speed, and that frequent
docking is necessary in vessels with bare iron or steel skins, which foul in a com-

paratively short time.

         Possibilities qf/urther Increase in Sjjeed.

From the facts above mentioned it is obvious that the increase in speed which

has been effected is the result of mony improvements, and has been accompanied

by large additions to size, engine- powei", and cost. These facts do not discourage

the ' inventor,' who finds a favourite field of operation in schemes for attaining

speeds of 50 to (JO knots at sea in vessels of moderate size. Sometimes the key to

this remarkable advance is found in devices for reducing surface-friction by the use

of wonderful lubricants to be applied to the wetted surfaces of ships, or by inter-

posing a layer of air between the skins of ships and the surrounding water, or

other departures from ordinary practice. If these gentlemen would ' condescend

to figures,' their estimates, or guesses, would be less sanguine. In many cases the

proposals made would  fail to produce  any sensible reduction in resistance                                                                                                                                  in others
                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

they would increase resistance.

Other proposals rest upon the idea that resistance may be largely reduced by

adopting novel forms, departing widely from ordinary ship shapes. Very often

small-scale experiments, made in an unscientific and inaccurate manner, are adduced

as proofs of the advantages claimed. In other instances mere assertion is thought

sufficient. Ordinarily no regard is had to other considerations, such as internal

capacity, structural weight and strength, stability and seaworthiness. Most of

these proposals do not merit serious consideration. Any which seem worth inves-

tigation can be dealt with simply and efi'ectively by the method of model experi-

Aments.  striking example of this method will be found in the unusual form of a

Parliamentary Paper (No. 31.3, of 1873), containing a Report made by Mr. William

Froude to the Admiralty. Those interested in the subject will find therein much

matter of special interest in connection with the conditions attending abnormally

high speeds. It must suffice now to say that ship-shaped forms are not likely to

be superseded at present.

The most prolific ' inventions ' are those connected with supposed improvements

in propellers. One constantly meets with schemes guaranteed by the proposers to

give largely increased efficiency and corresponding additions to speed. Variations

in the numbers and forms of screws or paddles, the use of jets of water or air

expelled by special apparatus through suitable openings, the employment of explo-

sives, imitations of the fins of fishes, and numberless other departures from esta-

Asablished practice are constantly being proposed.  rule the ' inventors ' have no

intimate knowledge of the subject they treat, which is confessedly one of great

difficulty. When experiments are adduced in support of proposals they are almost

always found to be inconclusive and inaccurate. More or less mathematical

demonstrations find favour with other inventors, but they are not more satisfactory

than the experiments. An air of great precision commonly pervades the statements

made as to possible increase in efficiency or speed. I have known cases where

probable speeds with novel propellers have been estimated (or guessed) to the

third place of decimals. In one such instance a trial was made with the new pro-

peller, with the result that instead of a gain in efficiency there was a serious loss

of speed. Very few of the proposals made have merit enough to be subjected to

trial. None of them can possibly give the benefits claimed.

It need hardly be added that in speaking thus of so-called ' inventors ' there is

no suggestion that improvement has reached its limit, or that further discovery is

not to be made. On the contrary, in regard to the forms of ships and propellers

continuous investigation is proceeding and successive advances are being made.

From the nature of the case, however, the difficulties to be surmoxmted increase as

speeds rise ; and a thorough mastery of the past history and present condition of

the problems of steamship design and propulsion is required as a preparation for

fruitful work in the nature of further advance.

It would be idle to attempt any prediction as to the characteristic features of

                                                                                                                                                                                                             3l2

ocean navigation sixty years lience. Radical changes may Well be made witlilil

that period. Confining attention to the immediate future, it seems probable that

the lines of advance which I have endeavonred to indicate will remain in use.

Further reductions may be anticipated in the weight of propelling apparatus and

fuel in proportion to the power developed                                                                                                                                                                                               farther savings in the weight of the

hulls, arising from the use of stronger materials and improved structural arrange-

ments; improvements in form ; and enlargement in dimensions. If greater draughts
of water can he made possible, so much the better for carrying power and speed.

For merchant vessels commercial considerations must govern the final decision; for

warships the needs of naval warfare will prevail. It is certain that scientific

methods of procedure and the use of model experiments on ships and propellers

will become of increased importance.

Already avenues for further progress are being opened. For example, the use

of water-tube boilers in recent cruisers and battleships of the Royal jNavy has

resulted in saving one-thivd of the weight necessary with cylindrical boilers of the

ordinary type to obtain the same power, with natural draught in the stokeholds.

Differences of opinion prevail, no doubt, as to the policy of adopting particular

types of water-tube boilers ; but the weight of opinion is distinctly in favour of

some type of water-tube boiler in association with the high steam pressures now in

use. Greater safety, quicker steam-raising and other advantages, as well aa

economy of weight, can thus be secured. Some types of water-tube boilers would

give greater saving in weight than the particular type used in the foregoing com-

parison with cylindrical boilers.

     Ditfereuces of opinion prevail also as to the upper limit of steam pressure which

can with advantage be used, taking into account all the conditions in both engines

and boilers. From the nature of the case, increases in pressure beyond the lt!0 to

180 lbs. per square inch commonly reached with cylindrical boilerg cannot have

anything like the same efl'ect upon economy of fuel as the corresponding increapes

have had, starting from a lower pressure. Some authorities do not favour any

excess above 250 lbs. per square inch on the boilers ; others would go as high aa
300 lbs., and some still higher.

Passing to the engine-rooms, the use of higher steam-pressures and greater

rates of revolution may, and probably will, produce reductions in weight com-

pared with power. The use of stronger materials, improved designs, better balance

of the moving parts, and close attention to details have tended in the same direc-

tion without sacrifice of strength. Necessarily there must be a sufficient margin

to secure both strength and endurance in the motive power of steamships. Existing

arrangements are the outgrowth of large experience, and new departures must be

carefully scrutinised.

     The use of rotary engines, of which Mr. Parsons's turbo-motor is the leading
example at present, gives the prospect of still further economies of weight. Mr.

Parsons is disposed to think that he could about halve the weights now required

for the engines, shafting, and propellers of an Atlantic liner while securing proper

strength and durability. If this could be done in association with the use of

water-tube boilers, it would efiect a revolution in the design of this class of vessel,

permitting higher speeds to be reached without exceeding the dimensions of existing

ships.

     It does not appear probable that, with coal as the fuel, water-tube boilers will

surpass in economy the cylindrical boilers now in use ; and skilled stoking seems

essential if water-tube boilers are to be equal to the other type in rate of coal

consumption. The general principle holds good that as more perfect mechanical

appliances are introduced, so more skilled and disciplined management is required
in order that the full benefits may be obtained. In all steamship performance the
' human factor ' is of great importance, but its importance increases as the appli-

ances become more complex. In engine-rooms the fact has beeu recognised and

the want met. There is no reason why it should not be similarly dealt with in

the boiler-rooms.

Liquid fuel is already substituted for coal in many steamsliips. "When suffi-

cmcient quantities      be obtained it has many obvious advantages over coal,

reducing greatly manual labour in embarking supplies, conveying it to the boilers
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                 853

and using it as fuL4. Possibly its advocattis have claimed for it greater econo'iiipal

advantages over coal than can be supported by the results of extended experiuienl.

Even if the saving in weight for ecjual evaporation is put as low as 30 per cent, of
the corresponding weight of coal, it would amount to 1,000 tons on a tirst-cla^s

Atlantic liuer. This saving might he utilised in greater power and higher speed,

or in increased load. There would be a substantial saving on the stokehold staff.

At present it does not appear that adequate supplies of liquid fuel are available.

Competent auth'n'ities here and abroad are giving attention to this question, and to
the development of supplies. If the want can be met at prices justifying the use

of liquid fuel, there will undoubtedly be a movement in that direction.

Stronger materials for the construction of hulls are already available. Thev

are, however, as yet but little used, except for special classes of vessels. Mild

steel has taken the place of iron, and effected considerable savings of weight.

Alloys of steel with nickel and other metals are now made which give strength
and rigidity much superior to mild steel, in association with ample ductility. For
destroyers and torpedo boats this stronger material is now largely used. It has

also been adopted for certain important parts of the structures of recent ships in

the Eoyal Navy. Of course the stronger material is more costly, but its use

enables sensible economies of weight to be made. It has been estimated, for

example, that in an Atlantic liner of 20 knots average speed about 1,000 tons

could be saved by using nickel steel instead of mild steel. This saving would

suffice to raise the average speed more than a knot, without varying the dimensions

of the ship.

Alloys of aluminium have also been used for the hulls or portions of the hulls

of yachts, torpedo-boats, and small vessels. Considerable savings in weight have

thus been effected. On the other hand, these alloys have been seriously corroded

when exposed to the action of sea-water, and on that account are not likely to be

extensively used. Other alloys will probably be found which will be free from

this defect, and yet unite lightness with strength to a remarkable degree.

     Other examples might be given of the fact that the metallurgist has by no

means exhausted his resources, and that the shipbuilder may look to him for

continued help in the struggle to reduce the weights of floating structures.

     It is unnecessary to amplify what has already been said as to possible increase
in the efficiency and types of propellers. With limited draught, as speeds increase

and greater powers have to be utilised, multiple propellers will probably come

into use.   Mr. Parsons  has shown  how such  problems  may be  dealt    with                       and
                                                                                                 ;

other investigators have done valuable work in the same direction.

In view of what has happened and is still happening, it is practically certain

that the dimensions of steamships have not yet attained a maximum.

Thanks to mechanical appliances, the largest ships built or to be built can be

readily steered and worked. In this particular, difficulties have diminished in

recent years, notwithstanding the great growth in dimensions.

     Increase in length and weight favours the better maintenance of speed at sea.
The tendency, therefore, will be to even greater regularity of service than at

present. Quicker passages will to some extent diminish risks, and the chance of

breakdown will be lessened if multiple propellers are used. Even now, with twin

screws, the risk of total breakdown is extremely small.
    AVhatever may be the size and power of steamships, there must come times at

sea when they must slow down and wait for better weather. But the larger and

longer the ves.spl, the fewer will be the occasions when this precaution need be

exercised.

It must never be forgotten that as ships grow in size, speed, and cost, so the

responsibilities of those in charge increase. The captain of a modern steamship

needs remarkable quahties to perform his nuiltifarious duties efficiently. The

chief engineer must have great powers of organisation, as well as good technical

knowledge, to control and utilise most advantageously the men and machinery in
his charge. Apart from the ceaseless care, watchfulness, and skill of officers and
men, the finest ships and most perfect machinery are of little avail. The ' human

factor ' is often forgotten, but is all-important. Let us hope that in the future as

jji the past, as responsibilities ipcyease so wi)l the men be found to bear them.

fire that always attends its use. Efforts to eliminate this danger have repeatedly

been made. Faraday demonstrated that many chemicals possessed the property,
when impregnated into the pores of the wood, of reducing the inflammability of

the same.

state of soda, boracic acid, sulphate of ammonia, sulphate of magnesia, chloride of

zinc.

     Fire as an element of naval warfare is traceable as far back as 190 B.C., when,
according to Livy, the Rhodians made use of fireships, or vessels filled with com-
bustibles, set adrift among the hostile fleet. Repeatedly since that early date
fireships have played a not unimportant part in naval warfare.

     With the advent of ironclads the utility of fireships passed away, but the
naval battles of the Chinese and Japanese War in 1894 showed conclusively that
in a new form fire was still a serious i&^Xox in naval engagements, three Chinese
warships being burned to the water's edge owing to their woodwork being set
ablaze Irom the shot and shell of the attacking fleet. It was this object lesson

that induced the naval authorities of the United States in 1895 to look about for

a remedy to prevent the wood of their warships from burning. Experiments with
wood impregnated with fire-proofing chemicals were made by the Government
of that country, with the result that two cruisers and two battleships then
under construction were fitted out with non-flammable wood. After some sixteen
months of service trial, a re-examination of the subject was officially ordered,
owing to reports that the treated wood corroded metals, absorbed moisture, and
failed to properly retain paint. The examination resulted in the continuance of
its use and extension to other American warships.

     In 1897, H.M. Admiralty commenced the investigation of non-flammable
wood, and after various tests specified it for the new royal yacht, the new battle-
ships, cruisers, and torpedo-boat destroyers now being constructed.

     The process by which wood is rendered non-inflammable consists in placing it

in cylinders of steel, closing the same tightly, and submitting to alternate appli-

--cations of heat and steam, after which the air is exhausted and the fire-prooting

solution one of the ingredients of which is phosphate of ammonia--admitted.
Pressure pumps are then applied, forcing the liquid into the pores of the wood.
The degrees of steaming, vacuum, and pressure vary according to the character

--of the wood. All kinds of wood are not amenable to the process some because

of the large quantity of resin or oil they contain, and irregular fibres resist thorough

impregnation. Teak, Austrian oak, Norway spruce, and American pitch-pine,
are particularly resistent, while yellow deal, white pine, mahogany, ash, elm,

birch, cherry, and English oak lend themselves readily to the treatment. In
the softer woods timber from three to four inches in thickness has been im-
pregnated successfully, but in the harder woods rarely more than two inches
can be impregnated throughout. For all practical purposes, it has been found

that impregnation for one inch all round renders the wood non-flammable
throughout. The amount of solution taken up by the softer woods is greater
than that absorbed by the harder woods. White pine takes more than twice
its origioal weight, while mahogany, oak, and teak only take up about 75 per
cent, of original weight. After the wood has become thoroughly impregnated

the next step is to evaporate the aqueous portion of the solution from the
                                                --

wood, leaving the resultant crystals deposited in the pores. The wood is then

dried iu a kiln at an even temperature not exceeding 120° F., having a free circu-
lation of dry air. The time required for proper drying varies from three to seven

weeks, depending upon the thickness of the wood. After the wood is thoroughly
dry it is ready for use, and will be found to be flame- and fire-resisting, merely

carbonising at the point of contact with fire.

The resistance of treated wood to the passage of electricity is decreased, while
Athe heat-resisting properties are increased.
                                               piece of yellow pine an inch thick

placed over the flame of a Bunsen burner, having on its upper surface some grains

of gunpowder, will not impart in four hours sufficient heat through the wood

to ignite the gunpowder.

    Experience has shown that care must be taken to have the treated wood

thoroughly dry before paint is applied.

 The  wisdom  of the      Americau  Government  in  having  the  woodwork  of its

_

ships of war made non-flammable was well exemplified during their recent war

with Spain, when, as is well known, several of the Spanish ships at Manilla and

Santiago de Cuba were burnt to the water's edge by the woodwork of the same

being set on fire from the bursting of the American shell, while more than one

American ship, having non-flammable wood on board, although shot throuo-h and

through, received no injury from fire.

                     By Captain E. W. Lloyd, of Elswick.

_ Torpedoes have not in actual warfare, up to the present, had any direct
influence, but they are retained as part of the armament of large ships, as no

Government likes to take the initiative in discarding them. As recent wars have
shown that toi-pedoes fired from above-water apparatus are a source of great

danger to their possessors, the necessity for discharge below the water has become
apparent. This necessity has been well met by the introduction of the Elswick
Submerged Torpedo Tube. This tube has been designed with a view to firing
torpedoes from the broadside of a ahip travelling at high speeds. Discharge il
preferably done by means of cordite, and it is only necessary to press a firing key
in the conning tower for the shield to be run out, the torpedo ejected, and the
shield returned. During the discharge, the ship travelling at a speed of 17 knots,
the torpedo is subjected to a total pressure of about 5-2 tons, and the shield or spoon
of the torpedo tube has to be made strong enough to support it against this strain.

2. On the Electric Conductivity and Magnetic Properties of an Extensive
    Series of Alloys of Iron, prepared hy R. A. Hadfield. By Professor
    W. F. Baerett, F.R.S., and W. Brown, B.Sc.

      During the last five years the authors have been engaged in the determination of
the physical properties of upwards of 100 alloys of iron, many of them entirely
new, and some of them presenting remarkable physical characteristics. This
splendid seiies of alloys or 'steels' has been prepared at considerable expenditure
by the liberality of Mr. Hadfield, M.LC.E., Managing Director of the Hecla Steel

Works, Sheffield, whose researches on the mechanical properties of many of these

alloys are well known. Mr. Hadfield has also had a chemical analysis of the

alloys made in the laboratory attached to bis works ; the paper may therefore be

said to be a joint contribution by three authors.
     Th&frst part of the paper deals with the electric conductivity of these alloys.

For the purposes of measurement the specimens were rolled into rods rather over
a metre long and about half a centimetre diameter, and after their conductivity
was measured in the unannealed condition they were then carefully annealed and
re-determined. Annealing was found to increase the conductivity in the case of
all the alloys. The potential method of measurement of conductivity was
employed, a comparison being made with a standard rod of pure copper, of known
 conductivity, and also with a standard rod of the purest commercial iron. Full
 details of the method of measurement and the results obtained will be found in
 the forthcoming Tolurae of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Dublin.

      In all the specimens the conductivity decreases as the percentage of the added
 element increases, at first rapidly and then very slowly. But the effect of
 different elements on the conductivity of the alloy varies largely. The addition of
 even small quantities of carbon, silicon, manganese, chromium, or aluminium
 lowers the conductivity of iron considerably, whereas corresponding quantities of
 nickel, copper, and tungsten have a much" less effect. The conductivity of the
 aluminium steels is extremely low, a particular specimen having 5^ per cent, of
 aluminium (with only 0-2 of carbon and the same amount of silicon) had a con-
 ductivity of only 2-16, pure copper being taken as 100, or a specific resistance of
 75 microhms per c.c, the specimen had also the low temperature coefficient of
 0-063 per cent, per degree Cent. It was a beautiful alloy and very ductile. But

 the highest resistance was found among the nickel manganese steels. One specimen
 having 25 per cent, of nickel and 6 per cent, of manganese with 1 per cent, of
 carbon, was found to have the extraordinary specific resistance of 97^ microhms
 per c.c. at 15° 0. and a temperature coefficient of 085 per cent, per degree Cent.
 This alloy also was easily worked and drawn into wire, but ^as harder apd less
 dijptjlp than the aluminium alloy just mentioned,

The  second  part  of  the  paper  deals  with  the  mafrnetic  properties  of  the  alloys
                                                                                                                   ;

complete B ^^"d H curves were made in the case of a large number of the speci-

mens. The magnetometric metlnd of measurement was t-mployed, each specimen

being^ taken through a magnetic cycle, with a maximum magnetising force of

45 C.G.S. units. The induction, the retentivity and coercivity of each specimen

are shown by the curves, and the permeability for a given magnetising force was

Restimated in each case. Mr. L. Wills, who, with Mr. R. G. A-llen, assisted in the

experiments, has also measured the areas enclosed by the curves, and thus deter-

mined the energy dissipated per cjxle in ergs per cubic cent. Some elements

were found to affect the hysteresis very differently to others and to very different

extents, depending upon the percentage of the element present. Annealing in

the case of some of the nickel and of the chromium-nickel and chromium-

manganese alloys converted a practically non-magnetic alloy into a strongly

magnetic one. For magaetising forces up to about 8 G.S. units, the addition

of '2\ per cent, of aluminium actually increases the permeability of iron ; very

small percentages of nickel also have the same effect for lower magnetising forces.

As the percentage of nickel increases, the induction and permeability rapidly

decrease and the hysteresis increases, but between 24^ and 31^ per cent, of

nickel in the alloy the hysteresis falls, owing to the rapid decrease in coercive

force between these percentages. The 31 percent, nickel steel had in fact an

exceptionally low coercive force, and a permeability greater than the best iron for

very low magnetising forces. Mechanical tests, made by Mr. Hadfield, show a

similar result, the curve representing the tensile strength of nickel steels rising

rapidly from 7 to a 12 per cent, nickel steel, then remaining nearly stationary

till 20 per cent, is reached, after which it falls rapidly to the highest per cent,

nickel steel tried, viz. 31^ per cent. This is exactly analogous to the curve
representing the coercive force of nickel stt^els. These interesting results were

obtained independently. Still more remarkable was the magnetic effect produced

by silicon when alloyed with iron and steel ; this is now under investigation.

3. Some Recent Applications ofElectro- Metallurgy to Mechanical Engineer-

    ing. By SiiERARD CowPER-CoLES, Assoc.M.Inst.C .E., M.I.M.E.,

      M.I.E.E'.

     The author commenced by pointing out the prominent position electro-metal-
lurg3' is now taking in many workshops, and enumerated the uses to which electro-

metallurgy is being applied. He then proceeded to give a description of an

electro-galvanising plant as used for coating the tubes of water-tube boilers
and the plates of torpedo-boat destroyers, and also gave details of the anode and
cathode bars used for suspending the electrodes, and information as to the thick-
ness of zinc applied and the current density and voltage employed. Estimates
were given as to the cost and output of various-sized plants, and the advantages of

electro-galvanising over hot galvanising were compared. The regenerative or
recuperative process and methods of circulation were also described.

     Particulars were then given of various electro-chemical processes for cleaning
iron and removing magnetic oxide and scale, and a model was shown of a mag-
netic scale collector for collecting the scale from the acid solution after its removal
from the iron or steel, so as to prevent the further unnecessary waste of acid.
Experiments made in this direction tended to show that a considerable proportion
of the acid is consumed by dissolving the scale after it has left the iron or steel.

    An electrolytic process for the manufacture of reflectors was then described,

suitable for making parabolic reflectors for search-lights. The various steps of the
process were given in detail. Briefly, the process consists in using a glass convex
mould on which is chemically deposited a coating of metallic silver, and then
 polished so as to ensure the copper backing being adherent to the silver. The
 mould thus prepared is placed in a suitable ring and frame and immersed in an
 electrolyte of copper sulphate, the mould being rotated in a horizontal
 position, the number of revolutions beipg about fifteen per piipute. 'J'hp

copper adheres fii-mly to tlie silver, and together they form the reflector,
which is subsequeutly separated from the glass mould by placing the whole
in cold or lukewarm water, and then gradually raising the temperature of

the water to 120° F., when the metal reflector will leave the glass mould, due to
the unequal expansion of the two. The concave surface of the reflector obtained
is an exact reproduction of the surface of the mould and has the same brilliant

polish, and requires no further treatment to auswer all the purposes of a reflector
with the exception that it must be coated with a film of some suitable metal to
prevent it tarnishing. Palladium is found to answer this purpose best, as a bright
coating can be deposited rapidly to any desired thickness. Palladium resists tar-
nishing and the heat of an arc to a wonderful degree.

         2. The Dymchurch Wall and Reclamation of Romney Marsh,
                 By Edward Case, Assoc. M.Inst.C.E., F.R.G.S.

     Commencing from the time of the Romans, the author traced the history of
the reclamation and protection of Romney Marsh down to the reign of Henry III.,
when the charter was first granted, and thence to the year 1562, during which
period the charter was repeatedly confirmed.

     Originally the sea was retained within its limits hy a shingle beach ; hut in
course of time this natural means of protection failed, and the breaches, which
occurred in places, had to be closed up by earth banks. As the shores gradually
wasted these artificial banks had to be extended, until at last they became the one
continuous embankment, known as the Dymchurch Wall.

     Romney Marsh, depending, as it does, on the Dymchurch Wall for immunity

from inundation by the sea, lies from 4 to 10 feet below tLie level of ordinary
spring tides. Including the adjoining marshes, it consists of some 60,000 acres o"f
very valuable arable and pasture land. The problem of sea defence, thus presented,
is doubtless the most important one that has ever arisen in the British Isles.

     The Dymchurch Wall, as it now stands, is about four miles in length. Its
top, 20 feet wide, stands 10 to 13 feet above ordinary spring tides. On its inland

Hside is an earth slope of to 1 ; on the seaward side a curved stone parapet,

6 feet deep, and thence down to the shore level an apron, graded 5 to 1 and 7 to 1,

and comprising about 40 acres of stone pitching. Since the early part of the
eighteenth century it has been persistently threatened by the sea ; and on
numerous occasions it has been subjected to damage, entailing the expenditure of
vast sums of money on restoration.

     The encroachment of the sea was attributed by the author to the denudation of
the shore near high water-mark, due to the growth of Dungeuess Point, which
caused the silting up of the bay and destroyed the uniform inclination of the fore-
shore. The commonly received opinion, that the travel of shore material is

arrested by promontories, was not accepted by him. He further showed that this

denudation was hastened by the form of the pitched apron, and by the
existence of high groynes. The author had arrived at the conclusion,' from
numerous sections, that the natural inclination of a. foreshore is elliptical, and
maintained that this should be kept in view in designing and constructing sea
defence works. The author's low groynes at Dymchurch, which have been in
course of erection during the past five years, are based on this principle. Unlike
high groynes, they have no scouring effect on the shore, but on the contrary are
the instruments by which the destructive forces of the sea have been utilised for
the accumulation of material. The foot of the apron is now protected by a
covering of sand, a natural inclination of repose exists in the shore, and both
erosion and encroachment have ceased.

    The author illustrated his paper by a map of the coast-line and three cross

sections of the shore.

3. An Instrument for Gauging the Circularity of Boiler Furnaces and
     Cylinders, 2}roducing a Diagram. By T. Messenger, A.M.I.C.E.

     Hitherto furnaces have generally been gauged for distortion bv a diameter
gauge, which is not so satisfactory as gauging radially, i.e. from a fixed point.

     The Author having this object in view :

     Firstly, designed that part of the instrument for fixing a pin as nearlv in the
centre of iurnace as possible by arranging three telescopic legs at equal angles
apart, viz. 120°, the points of these legs being caused to radiate outwards or

inwards simultaneously from the centre pin; so that when the points of these three

legs rest on the inner surface, and are locked there, the centre pin will always be in
the centre of these points. To do this in a suitable frame, a centre wheel is
mounted on the pin, which gears into three other wheels, or segments of wheels,
8G0 REPORT--1899.

and similar segments on tlie spindles of these gear into racks on tlie three telescopic
legs, thus compelling them to radiate outwards or inwards simultaneously.

      Secondly, the centre pin is arranged to receive a small drawing board to attach
a sheet of paper to.

     Thirdly, this centre pin also forms a pivot on which to mount a telescopic

pencil arm, ha\ing a roller at its outer end, the pencil being near its inner end.

This arm being moved round on the pivot, the roller will move inwards or outwards
if the furnace is deformed, and the pencil, following the movements of the roller,
and describing a small circle, will also move inwards or outwards, thus delineating
on the paper the deformities full size, but, as these are shown on the small circle,
they will apparently be greatly magnified, and so may easily be read by the eye,
thus enabling ihe commencement of deformities to be easily detected long before
it would be otherwise observed ; for if the roundness of a furnace is once
destroyed, the defect accentuates itself under ordinary working conditions. The

possibility of the gradual, but at last probably excessive, if not also dangerous,
distortion of furnaces might be guarded against, and the cause removed, if only
the first sign of the circularity of the furnace being defective were discovered.

     The diagram will completely delineate the actual shape of the furnace around
the whole of its circumference, and so enable the boilermaker, when setting a
furnace into truth, to know exactly where to deal with these defects.

    These diaf^rams should be taken when furnaces are new, before and after the
hydraulic test is put on, and retained for future reference when furnaces are from

time to time examined with this gauge.
     The instrument itself was shown.

4. Eocperiments on the Thrust and Poiver of Air-ProjKllers.
  i?v/ William George Walker, M.I.M.E., A.M.I.C.E.

    The first set of experiments were made with air-propellers of 2, 3, and 4 feet
in diameter. The following laws were proved for top speeds up to 15,000 feet

per minute.

     The thrust varies as the square of the number of revolutions, also as the area.
The horse-power varies as the cube of the revolutions, and for small angles as the

square of the angle of pitch. In the case of the four-foot diameter air-propeller,

a thrust of 15 lbs. per horse-power, at a top speed of 15,000 feet per minute, was

obtained.

     Experiments were then carried out on air-propellers of .30 feet in diameter.
They were made as light as possible, and weighed about 160 lbs. each, designed

for giving a thrust of 1,000 lbs. The area of the four blades was 360 square feet.

At forty revolutions per minute, a thrust of 120 lbs. was obtained with about four

Ahorse-power.  Mangin type of propeller was employed, the blades being fixed

one behind the other, and connected together by diagonal struts and ties ; the

object in plating a blade immediately behind another one is to increase the

strength and stillhess of the blades. The blades are made of solid drawn steel

tubes, and of diameters varying from | inch to 1 inch.
     The 30-foot air-propeller was tried at progressive revolutions, varying from

10 to 100 revolutions; also at different angles, varying from 4° to 20°,

                     Section H.--ANTHROPOLOGY.

            --Pke31dent of the Section C. H. Read, F.S.A.

                          THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

    The President delivered the following Address

The difficulties that beset the President of this Section in prepariaz an address are

chiefly such as arise from the great breadth of our subject. It is thought by some,

on the one hand, to comprehend every phase of human activity, so that if

a communication does not fall within the scope of any other of the Sections into
which the British Association is divided, it must of necessity belong to that of

anthropology. On the other hand, there are many men, wanting neither in intelli-
gence nor education, who seem incapable of grasping its general extent, but, mistaliing

a part for the whole, are fully content with the conclusions that naturally result

from such a parochial method of reasoning. The Oxford don who stated, a year or

two ago, his belief that anthropology rested on a foundation of romance can only
have arrived at this opinion by some such inadequate process, and the conclusion
necessarily fails to carry conviiction. The statement was, however, singularly ill-
advised, for anthropology gives way to no other branch of science in its reliance

upon facts for its existence and its conclusions. Had the reproach been that the
facts were often of a dry and repellent character we might have pleaded

 extenuating circumstances, but I fear it must have been admitted that there was
 some justice in the complaint, though we could fairly point to instances where
 master minds had made even the dry bones of anthropology live, and that without
 trenching upon the domain of romance.

     It is not, however, my purpose to-day to enter upon a general defence of

 anthropology as a branch of science. It has taken far too firm a hold upon ti'e
 popular mind to need any such help. I intend rather to treat of one or two special

 subjects with which I am in daily relation, in order to see whether some practical

 means cannot be found to bring about a state of things more satisfactory than that

  at present existing.

      The first of these branches is that of the prehistoric antiquities of our own
 country. It will not be denied that there can be no more legiumate subject of

  study than the remains of the inhabitants of our islands from the earliest appe»r-

  ance of man up to the time when written history comes to the aid of the

  arcbieologist. There is no civilised nation which has not devoted some part of its
  energies to such studies, and many of them imder far less favourable circumstance.s

 --than ours. The chiefest of our advantages is to be found in the small extent of

  the area to be explored an area ridiculously small when compared with that of
  most of the Continental nations, or with the resources at our command for its
  exploration. The natural attractions of our islands, moreover, have also had a great

  inHuence on nur Continental neighbours, so that their incursions have not been ie^,
  and no small number of them decided to remain in a country where the necessaries
862 fiEPoRT-- 1899.

of life t;vere obtainable under such agreeable conditions. Tlie eH'ect of tbese

incursions, so far as our present subject is concerned, is that there is to be found

in the British Islands a greater variety of prehistoric and later remains than is

seen in most European countries, a fact which should add considerably to the

interest of their exploration. At the same time also it must be boi-ne in mind that

it is by such researches alone that we can arrive at any true understanding of the

conditions of life, the habits and religious beliefs, or the physical characters of the

varied races who inhabited Britain in early times.

    It may seem unnecessary to urge, in face of these facts, that all such memorials

of  the past  should  be, in  the  first  place,  preserved                                                and, in the second, that any
                                                                                                        ;

examination of them should be undertaken only by properly qualified persons.

Unfortunately, however, it has never been more necessary than it is at the present
time to insist upon both points, and the fact that these prehistoric remains are
scattered impartially over the whole country, with the exception, perhaps, of the

sites of ancient forests, makes it almost impossible to devise any special measures

Anfor their preservation.     additional difficulty is to be found in the fact that many

ancient remains, such as the barrows of the early Bronze Age, are altogether

unrecognised as such, and in the process of cultivation have been ploughed down

almost to the level of the surrounding surface, until at last the plough scatters the
bones and other relics unnoted over the field, and one more document is gone that

might have served in the task of reconstructing the history of early man in

Britain.

    Such accidental and casual destruction is, however, probably unavoidable, and,

Webeing so, it is scarcely profitable to dwell upon it.                                                    can, perhaps, with more

advantage protest against wilful destruction, whether it be wanton mischief or

Anmisplaced archaeological zeal.          enlightened public opinion is our only protec-

tion against the first of these, and will avail against the second also, but we are

surely entitled to look for more active measures in preventing the destruction of

archaeological monuments in the name of archaeology itself. It is a far more

common occurrence than is generally realised for a tumulus to be opened by

Anpersons totally unqualitied for the task either by experience or reading.                                account

may then be printed in tlie local journal or newspaper. AVhen such accounts do

appear it is often painfully obvious that an accidental and later burial has been

mistaken for the principal interment, while the latter has been altogether over-

looked, and no useful record has been kept of the relative positions of the various

objects found. The loss that science has suS"ered by this indiscriminate and ill-
judged exploration is difficult to estimate, for it should be borne in mind that an

--ancient burial, once explored, is destroyed tor future searchers no second exami-

nation can produce results of any value, though individual objects overlooked by

chance may repay the energy of the later comers. So much varied knowledge is, in

fact, required for the proper elucidation of the ordinary contents of a British

barrow that it is almost impossible for any single person to perform the task

Aunaided.     wide experience in physical anthropology must be combined with an

acquaintance fully as wide with the ordinary conditions of such interments and

the nature, material, and relative positions of the accompanying relics, all of

which must be brought to bear, with discriminating judgment, on the facts laid
bare by the digger's spade. Added to this, the greatest precaution is needed that
nothing of value be overlooked. In some soils, such as a stiff clay, it is almost
impossible to guard against such a casualty, especially when the barrow is of
large size and vast masses of earth have to be moved. The amount of profitable

care that may be bestowed on scientific work of this character can nowhere be
better seen, I am glad to say, than in our own country, in the handsome volumes

produced by General Pitt-Rivers as a record of his investigations in the history

of the early inhabitants of Dorsetshire. The memoirs contained in them are

unsurpassed for scientific thoroughness, and they will probably Ions stand as the
model of what archaeological investigation should be. It is very seldom, however,

that circumstances conspire so favourably towards a desired end as in the case of

General Pitt-Rivers, where a scientific training is joined to the love of research,

and finally ample means give full scope for its praciice under entirely favour-

able conditions. "While it is, perhaps, too much to expect that all explorations

of this character should be carried through with the same minute attention to

detail that characterises General Pitt-Itivers's diggings, j'et his memoirs should
be thoroughly studied before any work of the same kind is entered upon, and

should be kept before the miud as the ideal to be attained. It is not too much to
say that a diligent study of the works of the two foremost explorers of pre-

-- --historic remains in this country Canon Greenwell and General Pitt-Eivers will

of itself suffice to qualify any intelligent antiquary to conduct the exploration of

any like remains. At the same time, it must not be forgotten that exploration is

one thing and a useful record of it is another, and here the explorer would do well
to invite the co-operation of specialists if he would get the full value out of his

work, and there is generally little difficulty in getting such help.

     I have ventured to point out, in moderate terms, the dangers to which a large
number of our prehistoric sites are liable, and to state under what conditions they

should be investigated. It is not unreasonable to expect, if the danger is so
obvious, that a remedy should be forthcoming to meet it. In most ot the Con-

tinental States it would be easy to institute a scheme of State control by which

such sites would vest in the Government to just such an extent as would be

 necessary to prevent their being destroyed, and such                                                                                               a  scheme  might be cheerfully

.

accepted and applied with success in any country but our own. Here, however

we are so accustomed to rely upon individual influence and exertion in matters of

this kind that an appeal to the Government is scarcely thought of ; while, on the

other hand, the rights of property are fortunately so safeguarded by our tradition
and law that nothing but a futile Act of Parliament would have the least cliance

of passing. Moreover, experience teaches us that it is not to State control that

we must look. The Ancient Monuments Bill, which was intended to protect a

special class of monuments, and was framed with a full regard to the rights of

owners, still stands in the Statute Book, but for years past it has had no etiective

Talue whatever. That being so, we must look to private organisations, and

preferably to those already in existence, for some effectual moral influence and con-

trol, and, in my judgment, the appeal could best be made to the local scientific

societies. Many of these are very active in their operations, and could well bear

an addition to their labours                                                                                                                        others, less active, might become more energetic if thev
                                                                                                                                                 ;
--bad a definite programme. The plan I would propose is this : Each society should

record on the large scale Ordnance map every tumulus or earthwork within the

county, and at the same time keep a register of the sites with numbers referring to the
map, and in this register should be noted the names of the owner and tenant of the

property, as well as any details which would be of use in exploring the tumuli. I am

well aware that a survey of this kind has been begun by the Society of Antiquaries of
London, and is still in progress ; but this is of a far more comprehensive character,

and is, moreover, primarily intended for publication. The more limited survev I

now advocate would in no way interfere with it, but, on the contrary, would provide

material for the other larger scheme. Once the local society is in possession of

the necessary information just referred to, it would be the duty of its executive to

exercise a beneficent control over any operations affecting the tumuli, and it may
safely be said that such control could in no way be brought to bear so easily and

effectively as through a local society.

    Some of the arguments in favour of some such protection for our unconsidered
ancient monuments have been already briefly stated, and, in conclusion, I would

only urge this in their favour, that while the more beauti 'ul monuments of later and

historic times are but little likely to want defenders, the less attractive early
remains are apt to disappear not so much from want of appreciation as from want

of knowledge, and I would repeat that it is from them alone that we can reconsti-
tute the life- story of those who lived in what we may, with truth, call our dark

ages.

    I will now ask you to turn your attention to another matter in which it seems '
to me that this country has opportunities of an unusually favourable kind. I refer

to the collection of anthropological material from races which still remain in a

fairly primitive state. It is somewhat trite to allude to the extent of our Empire
SG4 , REPORT-- 1899.

and the vast liuiiiber of races either subject to our rille oi' ^ho look to U3 iov
guidance and protection. The number may be variously computed according to

 the bias, philological or physical, of the observer, but it will not be contested that
 our opportunities are without precedent in history, nor that they greatly exceed

 those of auy existing nation. That being so, it may not be useless to see how far

 these opportunities are utilised. While it will not be denied that the Indian
 Government and the Governments of some of our colonies have done excellent
 work in the direction of anthropological research and publication, and that
 exhaustive reports from our colonial officials are frequently received and after-
 wards entombed in parliamentary papers, yet it is equally clear that work of this
 kind is not a part of our administrative system, but rather the protest of the intelli-

I

 gent official mind against the monotony of routine. The material, the opportunity,
' as well as the intelligence and will to use both, are already in existence, and all
 that is now wanted is that the last should be encouraged and the work be done on

 a systematic plan, and, as far as may be, focussed on some centre where it may be

 available for present and future use. It was for this end that I ventured to bring
 before the British Association at the Liverpool meeting a scheme for the establish-
 ment of a central Bureau of Ethnology for Greater Britain. Frequent appeals

 had been made to me by officials of all kinds in distant parts of the Empire to tell
 them what kind of research work they could most usefully undertake, and it
 seemed a pity not to reduce so much energy and goodwill into a system. Hence
 the Bureau of Ethnology. The Council of the Association, on the recommenda-
 tion of the Committee, invited the Trustees of the British Museum to undertake

 the working of the Bureau ; this they have accepted, with the result that if the

 Treasury will grant the small yearly outlay it will be under my own supervision.

 If I had foreseen this ending I might have hesitated before starting a hare the
 chasing of which will be no sinecure.

      It was considered necessary, before attempting to begin the work of the Bureau
 by communicating with commissioners and other officials in the various Colonies
 and Protectorates, to lay the matter before Lord Salisbury and to invite his
  approval of the scheme. The whole correspondence will appear in the Report of
 the present meeting, but I may be pardoned for quoting one paragraph of the
  circular letter from the Foreign Office to the several African Protectorates. It is
 as follows : ' Lord Salisbury is of opinion that Her Majesty's officers should be
  encouraged to furnish any information desired by the Bureau, so far as their duties
 will allow of their doing so, and I am to request you to inform the officers under
  your administration accordingly.' "Wlien it is remembered that this is strictly
 official phraseology, its tenor may be considered entirely satisfactory, and there can
  be little doubt that other departments of the Government will recognise the utility
  of the Bureau in the same liberal spirit. Thus we shall have within a short lime

  (

' an organisation which will systematically gather the records of the many races
  v/hich are either disappearing before the advancing white man, or, what is equally

  fatal from the anthropological point of view, are rapidly adopting the white man's
  habits and forgetting their own.

       The Bureau of Ethnology, however, will only perform a part of the task that
  has to be done. While there is no doubt of the value of knowledge as to the
  religious beliefs and customs of existing savages, it is surely of equal importance
  that anthropological and ethnological collections should be gathered together with
  the same energy. The spear of the savage is, in fact, far more likely to be
  replaced by the rifle than is his religion to give way to ours. Thus the spear

  will disappear long before the religion is forgotten. It may be said that we have
  collections of this kind in plenty, and it is true that in tlie British Museum, at

  Oxford, Cambridge, Liverpool, and Salisbury, there are indeed excellent
  collections of ethnology, while at the College of Surgeons and the Natural History

  ^Museum there are illustrations of physical anthropology in great quantity.
  Whatever might be the result if all these were brought together, there can be no
  qiiestion that no one of them meets the requirements of the time. Here also there
  is a want of a system that shall at once be worthy of our Empire and so devised
  as to serve the ends of the student. Where, if not in England, should be found

nations are ahead of us in this matter. This could be readily understood if theii'
sources of supply were at all comparable to ours. But this is, of course, very far

from being the case. The sources are oursing;reat part, and if we stand inactive
it is not unlikely that some will be exhausted when we do come to draw upon them.

It is, perhaps, better to give here a case in point rather than to rely on general
statements./ In the summer of last year I arranged, with the approval of the'

Trustees, that Mr. Dalton, one of the myofficers of department, should make a

tour of inspection of the ethnographical museums of Germany, with a definite
object in view, but at the same time that he should make a general survey
of their system and resoui'ces as compared with our own. The report which he
drew up on his return was printed and has recently been communicated to the
newspapers ; it is therefore not necessary to allude to it now, except to quote one

instance confirming my statement that it is to a great extent from our colonies

that material is being drawn. _ Mr. Dalton says : ' On a moderate estimate the
Berlin collections are six or seven times as extensive as ours. To mention
a single point, the British province of Assam is represented in Berlin by a
whole room and in London by a single case.' But even this, forcible though it is,

does not adequately represent the vast difference between the material at the

disposal of the two countries. For it is the habit of the collectors for the German
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

museums to procure duplicates or triplicates of every object, for the purposes of
exchange or study. It is thus not unlikely that the whole room referred to
represents only a part of the Berlin collection from the British province of Assam.
In making these observations, I should be sorry if it were thought that I wish to

advocate a dog-in-the-manger policy, or that I consider it either desirable or

politic to place any restriction upon scientific work in our colonial possessions, even
if such restrictions were possible. I would prefer to look at the matter from an
entirely different point of view. If the German people, who are admittedly

practical and businesslike, think it worth whil?, with their limited colonies, to

spend 80 much time and money on the establishment of a royal museum of
ethnography, how much more is it our duty to establish and maintain one, and
on a scale that shall bear some relation to the magnitude of our Empire. The
value of such museums is by no means confined to the scientific inquirer, but they
may equally be made to serve the purpose of the trader and the public at large.

    How can we best obtain such a museum ? That is the question that we have

to answer. It is scarcely profitable to expect that the Government will be stirred to

emulation by the description of the size and resources of the Museum fiir Volker-
kunde in Berlin, In the British Museum there is at the present time only the

most limited accommodation even for the collections already housed there, and I

am well aware that these form a very inadequate representation of the subject.
     It may be thought that the solution of this difficulty is easy. It is well known

that the Government has purchased the rest of the block of land on which the

British Museum stands, and it may seem that such a liberal extension as this

will form should be enough for, at any rate, a generation or two, and that a little

additional building would meet immediate wants, and enable the collections, now

80 painfully crowded, to be set out in an instructive and interesting way. I admit

that if the whole of the contemplated buildings were at this moment complete, and
at least double as much space given to the ethnographical collections as they occupy at
present, the difficulty would be much simplified. The collections could at any rate be
then displayed far more worthily and usefully. Even this, however, would hardly

meet the case, even if there were a certainty of the buildings being immediately

begun. Such works as these, however, can only be executed in sections during the
course of each financial year. Thus, even if a Chancellor of the Exchequer could be
found to fall in entirely with the views of the Trustees, it would still be an appre-

ciable number of years before the completion of the entire range of galleries that is

 contemplated. For this reason alone I do not look forward to obtaining the space

 that is even now urgently wanted for some time. Meanwhile the natural and
legitimate increase of the collections at the rate of about 1 to 2 per cent, per annum

1899,                              3K
866 REPORT-- 1899.

still goes on, and the original difficulty of want of room would still face us, though
in a lesser degree. This estimate of the rate of increase may seem a high one ; but
it should not be forgotten that the science is new, and that it is only within the
last few years that such collections have been made on scientific lines, instead of being
governed only by the attractive character or rarity of the object. The gaps that
exist in such a series as that of the British Museum, made in great part on the old
lines, are relatively more numerous than would be the case in museums more
recently founded. Another reason, equally cogent, for allowing far more room than

is required for the mere exhibition of the objects is that, in my judgment, ethno-

graphical collections, to be of real value, need elucidation by means of models,
maps, and explanatory descriptions, to a far greater extent than do works of art,
which to the trained eye speak eloquently for themselves. Such helps to under-
standing necessitate a considerable amount of space, though the outlay is fully
justified by their obvious utility, and in any general scheme of rearrangement of

the national collection they should be considered an essential feature.
      There is yet another factor to be considered. It has been the fashion in this

country to consider remains illustrating the physical characters of man to belong

to natural history, while the productions of primitive and uncultured races gene-
rally find a place on the antiquarian side. Thus the skull of a Maori will be found
at the natural history branch of the British Museum, while all the productions of
the Maori are three miles distant in Bloomsbury. Such an arrangement can per-

haps be defended on logical grounds, but its practical working leaves much to
desire, and the arguments for a fusion of the two are undoubtedly strong. For
instance, the student of one branch would be unlikely to study it alone without

acquiring a knowledge of the other, while the explorers to whom we look for

collections usually give their attention to both classes of anthropological material.

Here again, in such a case, there would be a call for still more space at

Bloomsbury.

     If I may be permitted to add one more to the requirements of what should be

an attainable ideal, I should like to say that courses of lectures on anthropology
delivered in the same building that contains the collections would form a fitting

crown to such a scheme for a really Imperial museum of anthropology as I have

endeavoured to sketch. There is but one chair of anthropology in this country,
and admirably as that is filled by Professor Tylor, he would himself be the first to
admit that there is ample room and ample material to justify the creation of a

second professorship.

    It will be admitted that if my premisses are well founded the conclusion must
necessarily be that we cannot look to the British Museum to furnish us eventually

with the needful area and other resources for the installation of a worthy museum
of anthropology. The difficulties are far too great for the Trustees to overcome,

 unless by the aid of such an exhibition of popular enthusiasm as I fear our branch

 of science cannot at present command. Failing the British Museum, which may
be called the natural home of such a collection, we must look elsewhere for the

 necessary conditions, and I think they are to be found, although it is possible that,

however favourable these conditions may seem from our point of view, difficulties
 may already exist or arise later.

      It is not the first time that a scheme has been thought out for the establish-

 ment of a museum or kindred institution which should represent our colonies and
 India. In the year 1877 the Royal Colonial Institute made a vigorous effort in
 this direction, and, in combination with the various chambers of commerce through-
 out the country, advocated the building of an ' Imperial Museum for the Colonies
 and India ' on the Thames Embankment, with the then existing India Museum as a
 nucleus. The arguments then brought forward were in the main commercial, but
they are, if anything,_more forcible now than they were twenty years ago. The

 competition with foreign countries has become keener on the one hand, while the
 bonds between the colonies and the parent country are notoriously closer and more

 firm than at any previous time. No moment could thus be more opportune than

 the present for the foundation of a really Imperial Inetitution to represent our vast
 Colonial Empire.

myThe last sentence has, perhaps, given an indication of  solution of the

question. The Imperial Institute at South Kensington has now been in existence

for some time, and has passed through various phases. But its most enthusiastic

supporters will scarcely claim for it entire success in its mission. Whatever may

be the underlying causes, it must be admitted that such popular support as it

possesses is scarcely founded on the performance of its functions as an Imperial

--Institute. It would seem, therefore, that something more is wanted a more
--definite raison d'etre than it has at present, and this I think it will tind in being

converted into such a museum of anthr^ ipology as I have indicated, but, of course,
as a Government institution I am by no means an advocate of the creation of

new institutions, if the old ones can adequately do their work, nor do I think that

anything but ill would result from a general partition of the contents of the British

Museum. The separation of the natural history from the other collections was

painful, though inevitable, and no such severe operation can be performed without

loss in some direction. But the removal of the ethnographical and anthropological

collections from the British Museum to the galleries of the Imperial Institute
would possess so many manifest advantages that the disadvantages need scarcely

be considered. The Government has already taken over a portion of the building

for the benefit of the University of London. The remaining portion would provide

ample accommodation for the anthropological museum, as well as for the com-

mercial side, that might properly and usefully be continued ; its proximity to the

natural history branch of the British Museum would render control by the trustees

easy ; the Indian collections, which formed so important a feature in the scheme

of 1877, are at this moment under the same roof; and finally the University of

London has but to found a chair of anthropology, and the whole of the necessary

conditions of success are fulfilled.

I have but little doubt that, wherever it might be placed, the creation of a

distinct department of anthropology would of itself Lend to the enrichment of the

collnctions. It must be remembered that it is only since 1883, when the Christy'

collection was removed to the British Museum, that the ethnographical collections

there can claim any kind of completeness. Until then one small room contained

the few important objects of this kind that had survived from the voyages of

Cook, Wallis, and the other early voyagers. The public did not expect to find
ethnography in the British Museum, and it is, in fact, only within the last few

years tbat it has been generally realised that a gallery of ethnography exists there.

If it were placed in such a building as tbe Imperial Institute, it would still remain'

part of the British Museum, and be under the guardianship of its Trustees ; but it
would obviously command more attention and support from the public than can

be expected while it remains an integral part of a large institution which has as r

many aims as it has departments.

     I began this address by stating that it would have a practical application. I

trust that to others it may seem that what I have ventured to suggest is not onlv

possible of achievement, but would also be beneficial to the branch of science
that we represent. I should like to add that, as far as possible, I have tried to

state the case as it would appear to one who regarded the situation from an

entirely independent standpoint, and wishing only to discover the most practical

Mysolution of what must be admitted to be a difficult question.  allegiance to

the British Museum, however, may well have tinged my views, unnoticed by

myself. There are many other subjects that might well have formed the subject

of an address at the present time. On such occasions as these, however, it is, I

think, advisable to select a subject with especial reference to the needs of the

time, and I know of nothing that is at the present moment moie urgent in this

particular direction, and in my judgment it will tend greatly towards the true

advancement of science, the object we all have at heart.

5. Finger Prints of Young Children. By Francis Galton, D.C.L., F.M.S.

At the times when I published my book on ' Finger Prints,' and subsequent

·works on the same subject, no material existed for determining the age at which the

patterns of the ridges on the fingers and their numerous details became first

established. The ridges were known to be traceable in some degree long befoie

birth, but it was not known whether they bad acquired, even in early childhood,

that strange complexity of distribution which I showed to be permanent from

youth upwards. The wish to complete my work by investigating this interesting

physioloijical point was sharpened by a request for an opinion on the following

case. The police authorities in  (I will not say what country) received informa-

tion that a baby who was heir to a great title and estate might be kidnapped for the

sake of extorting ransom. Such cases have occurred in history, and it is needless

to insist on the miserable doubts and legal difficulties that would arise if a stolen

infant should be restored after the lapse of some time without satisfactory identi-

fication. I was asked whether prints of the fingers of a baby would serve for

ever afterwards to identify him, and to prove that he was not a changeling.

An American lady-- JJrs. John Gardiner, of JSoulder, Colorado--kindly volun-

teered to collect finger prints of infants for me. The following remarks are

confined to those of her own child Dorothy, whose fingers she printed every day

after that of her birth for a short time, then less frequently, and afterwards yearly, the

child being now 4i years old. By selecting the best of the numerous specimens of the

earlier dates, I compiled three sets of all the ten fingers. In the first set the age

of the child lay between 9 days and a mouth. In the second, between I mouth
and 6 weeks ; in the third, between 5 and 7 months. In addition, I have a fourth

set taken at 17 months, a fifth at 2^ years, and a sixth at 4i years.

    It is easy to those who have learnt the art, and who have the necessary
materials, to print with sharpness the fingers of children who have attained six years

of ao'e or upwards; but it is exceedingly difficult to print the fingers of babies.
Far more delicate printing is needed on account of th*' low relief of the ridges and

the minutenef.8 of the pattern. At the same time, babies are most difficult to deal

with, the persistent closing of their fists being not the least of the difficulties.

The result is that many undecipherable blurs are made before one moderate succe.ss
is attained, and, at the best, the print is made by a mere dab of the finger, rolled

impressions being practically impossible. Consequently the first four sets are al 1
more or less blotted, and none show more than a small part of that surface which

it is desirable to print.

     The fifth and sixth sets are clear though pale, for it was necessary to spread

the ink very thinly to avoid blots ; otherwise they are perfectly suited for com-
parisons. The two sets agree in every detail, and show the same order of

complexity that is found in the ridges of adult persons ; so, subject to the possi-
bility of some minute after change, I should infer that the print of a child's fingers

at the age of 2 J years would serve to identify him ever after. It will be interesting

after the lapse of some years to ascertain whether this is the case with Mias

Dorothy Gardiner.

     The Brst lour sets are much more difficult to deal with. I have scrutinised
them, and compared them several times with the last two sets and with one another,

and my conclusions are as follows :

     (1) The type of the pattern is never douhtful to a practised eye. To an
unpractised eye the result of a slight twist of the finger at the moment of printing,
which gives a specious air of circularity, might convey the false impression of a
whorl to what was really an arch or a loop. (-I) The character of the core
is defined within narrow limits, but not always accurately. Thus in one in-
stance, the core of a loop in the 2^- and 4|- year sets was a clear ' staple.' At
17 months the staple was connected to the curve next above it by a small

--isthmus ; in babyhood the staple and the ridge were joined whether by a blot or in

Areality I cannot say. (3) similar absence of distinction betwceji ridges that are

Vafterwards clearly separated is often found near the point. It is thus impossible

to count the number of ridges with accuracy that lie between the core and the V,
and the entry has often to take such a form at 9 + ? the ? proving to be any number
between one and perhaps eight ridges. It is, however, a great point to be assured

that the real number is not less than 9. (4) The doubt (as I pointed out in my

book) which is always attached to the exact way in which a new ridge arises is
goreatly increased in these prints. No weight should be assigned to the character
of the junction or ending, but only to the fact that somehow a new ridge has

become interpolated.
     The study of these prints is an excellent discipline in the art of decipherment.

I have counted sixty-eight details in the prints of these ten fingers that can be
identified throughout all six sets, unless obliterated in some one of them by a blot.

In the majority of cases the identity is unquestionable ; in the others it may be

trusted within narrow limits. I have therefore little doubt that the prints of

all ten fingers of a baby, if taken as clearly as those I have dealt with, would suffice
for after identification by an expert, but by an expert only.

     It should be added that I have had as yet no opportunity of taking finger

prints from infants who are two or even more months younger than babies ordi-

--narily are at the time of their births I mean such as are now successfully reared

in warmed glass cases. These premature infants are passive, and in that respect
easy to deal with, but they are tiny creatures who require great tenderness in

handling. I think that the impressions most likely to succeed would be those that
their greasy fingers might leave on a highly polished metal plate, to be afterwards
photographed under suitable illumination.

6. Finger Prints and the Detection of Crime in India, describing the System
     of classifying Finger Prints and how all the great Departments in

    India have brought Finger Prints into use. By E. E. Henky, C.S.I.,

     Inspector-General of Police, Bengal Civil Service.

    The author refers to the importance of fixing human personality so that no
efforts made to confuse it subsequently may prove availing. Of this problem the
Bertillon system ofl'ered first scientihc solution. But experience has shown that
the ' Personal Equation ' error of measures predominates so much as to vitiate

seriously the correctness of the recorded results under that system. Finger prints,
on the other hand, being absolute impressions taken from body under conditions
which eliminate error in transcribing or recording, the ' Personal Equation ' error
is reduced to a minimum. Taking the impressions of all ten digits occupies only
ia fraction of the time required for measuring, while search is more exhau.stive and

many times more rapid. This new system has been introduced on a most exten-
sive scale throughout British India, where the Postal, Survey, Registration,

Medical, Pensions, Emigration, Police, Opium, and other great Departments have
adopted it, and the Legislature has recognised it by passing, with the strong

approval ot all representative bodies consulted, an Act to amend tlie Law of

Evidence so as to make relevant the testimony of Finger-print Experts.

The main difficulty hitherto experienced had been that of providing an effective

Asystem of classification. But this difficulty has been overcome.                                                                                  thin film of

printer's ink is spread over a piece of flat tin, and each finger in turn is pressed on

the film, and after being thus inked is pressed on paper where a clear, sharp im-

pression is left. Fingers are impressed in their natural order of thumb, index,

middle, ring, and little, those of the right hand being above, and the corresponding

digit of the left hand below them.

  --All impressions must be either arches, loops, whorls, or composites there is a

great preponderance of loops and whorls. In primary classification arches are

included under loops, and composites under whorls, and therefore, for purposes of

primary classification, an impression must be either a loop or whorl. The digits

are taken in the following pairs : (1) right thumb and right index ; (2) right middle

and right ring                                                         (3) right little and left thumb ;  (4)              left  index  and  left  middle                          (5)
                                                                    ;                                                                                                           ;

Lleft ring and left little finger. Taking first pair and denoting loop by                                                                                                          and

whorl by W, we get the following arrangements. Kight thumb may be L and

                                                                       right  thumb may be  L and right   index                         right thumb may be

                                                                              and right thumb may  be

are four, and not more than four, arrangements possible. Similarly, in second pair,

there are four such arrangements, which, taken with those of the first pair, yield

16 combinations ; taking the third pair we get 64 combinations, and by adding

the fourth and fifth pairs, this number rises to 256 and 1,024. Now 1,024 equals

32 squared ; in other words, a cabinet containing '62 sets of 32 pigeon-holes

Aarranged vertically would provide all the locations required.                                                                               diagram shows

how this works in practice. But the following rule is very simple. The first of

each pair is shown as numerator, the second of each pair as denominator, yielding

wfor the five sets of pairs some such formula as the following : -^ ' --j--' t~ ;                                                                                                  ; w'

A whorl in the first pair counts 16, in the second pair 8, in the third 4, in the

fourth 2, in the fifth 1. No numerical value is given to a loop. Substituting

these values in the formula we get ^^ ; § ; g ; 5 ; x = i^- Add 1 to both nume-

rator and denominator and invert the fractiim which becomes ff, and this is the
Primary classification number, and represents that tlie card containing these im-

pressions will be found on the twentieth pigeon-hole ot the eleventh vertical row.

The Secondary classification required to break up accumulations is equallj simple,

and the search formula or legend for each card can be prepared rapidly without

any key and brings search down to groups of very small volume.

         1. Sotne New Observations and a Suggestion on Stonehenge.
                     By Alfred Eddowes, M.D., M.R.C.P.

     The author helieves that the thirty large upright stones, with their intervals^
indicate that the circle was divided into sixty equal parts ; that the Grooved Stone
(which is the best selected, worked, and preserved stone in the whole ruin, but has
nevei hitherto received the attention it deserved) was used for supporting a pole in
a definite and permanent manner ; and that the signs of wear at the mouth of the
groove, together with the two worn horizontal hollows or waists, and the dimples
on the convex back of the stone, indicate not only where, but how, this pole was
fixed. Such a pole would form the pointer of a sun-dial for daily observation, or

--what was more important an indicator of the time of year, by the length of its

shadow. The levelled avenue (along which the sun's shadow would fall about
3 P.M.) and the flat * slaughter-stone ' with its arrow-head marking, seem to the

author to support his view.

     3. Notes on the Discovery of Stone Implements in Pitcairn's Island.

                      By J. Allen-Brown, F.G.S., F.R.G.S.

     The implements were obtained in Pitcairn Island by Lieutenant Gerald Pike,

R.N., during the cruise of H.M.S. Comm in 1897-8, and the greater part of them

are in his possession.

     They are made of the compact volcanic rock of the island, and were discovered
about a foot below the surface.

     One class consists of small celts chipped and partially ground, with the sides
worked to a ridge, and resemble those discovered at Tahiti and in some other
islands of the Pacific. Another class consists of large chipped and ground axes
with long narrow shank and widespread cutting edge. Other forms again are a
long clublike chisel, well smoothed and shaped as if for a handle grip at the butt-
end, and a plain cylindrical club, such as might be used for beating Tapu cloth,
 though the modern Tapu clubs are of wood, and square in section.

4. On the Occurrence of ' Celtic ' Ti/2)es of Fibula of the Hallstatt and
    La Tene Periods in Timisia and Eastern Algeria. By Arthur J.

      Evans, 3LA., F.S.A.

In the course of a recent journey tlirough Tunisia and Eastern Algeria, the

author tound repeated evidence that a form of ' Lite Celtic' fibula, answering to a

well-known ' Middle La Tene ' type of continental archaeologists, was in use among

the ancient Numidians.  Three  examples of this were  described                                        two  from  near
                                                                                                    ;

Oonstantine (the ancient Cirta), and one from a dolmen near El-Kef {Sicca

Venerea). The author traced the origin of this type in the lands about the head

of the Adriatic, and its subsequent diffusion on European soil. Attention was
called to the new materials for the chronology of this and other allied forms,

supplied by Bianchetti's excavations in the Gaulish cemeteries of Ornavasso near

the Lago Maggiore, where a large series of tombs were approximately dated by

the presence of coins.

     The author also described some examples of earlier fibulae found at Carthage,

and in a dolmen near Guyotville in Algeria. Two of the forms are parallel to
those found in the early cemetery of Fusco near Syracuse, and may have been due

to the same Corinthian influence which during the sixth, seventh, and eighth

centuries seems to have been predominant at Carthage itself. Another Cartha-

ginian tibula is identical with a Hallstatt type, and is the prototype of the ' cross-

bow 'form so widely distributed throughout the north, when it gave birth to a

long succession of derivative forms reaching down in Gothland and elsewhere to

mediaeval times. In the case of both the earlier and later African examples there

is thus an indication pointing to the ancient course of the amber trade by the

Adriatic coast. The appearance of Celtic types of fibula among the Numidians

finds its complement in the discovery of large hoards of Carthaginian and

Numidian coins on the transit line of this commerce between the Save and the

Adriatic. Attention was further called to the appearance of ' Late Celtic ' forms

of Fibula in the Carthaginian Dominion of Western Sicily.

                5. On Irish Copi^er Celts. By George Coffey.

     Celts, apparently of unalloyed copper, though rare compared with those of
bronze, have been found in considerable numbers in Ireland. Thirty specimens

are described or mentioned in tlie Catalogue of the Museum of the Royal Irish
Academy, published in 18(51. The Academy's Collection (now in the National
Museum, IJublin) at present numbers eighty-two examples.

     Copper celts are not confined to any particular district : examples are recorded

--from the counties of Donegal, Londonderry, Antrim, Cavan,Mayo, Galway, Louth,

Tipperary, Waterford, Cork localities embracing the extreme north and south,
and east and west of the island.

    One specimen was analysed by J. W. Mallet in 1853: it gave copper, 98'74;

tin, 1-011.'

      During the present year Mr. J. Holmes PoUok, Royal College of Science,
Dublin, kindlj analysed lor me eight additional specimens as shown on next

     The analyses are fairly in line with analyses of copper celts from other

parts of Europe, with the exception of W. 10. This celt is one of the best

 finished copper celts in the collection ; the metal is, however, very soft and hardly
 serviceable. It is remarkable for the almost total absence of tin (O'Oo) and the
high percentage of lead (2-74). There is not evidence to show whether the
presence of the lead is intentional or accidental. It was found at Tramore,
county Waterford, a rich copper district. Numerous lodes of copper and lead are
exposed in the clifis of this locality, and extensive remains of ancient workings
have been found in a promontory near Tramore.

  1. Final Report on the Ethnographical Survey of the United Kingdotn,

                 2. On Recent Ethnographical Work in Scotland.
                                   By J. Geay, B.Sc.

     Preliminary observations on the physical characteristics of the people of East
Aberdeenshire, begun in 1895 by the Buchan Field Club, were summarised in a
paper at the Ipswich Meeting of this Association (1895, p. 831), and published more
fully in the ' Transactions ' of the Buchan Field Club.

   A pigmentation survey of the whole of the school-children of East Aberdeen-

shire has since been completed, chiefly through the organising ability of Mr.
Tocher, the Secretary of the Buchan Field Club, and the generous and gratuitous
co-operation of the school teachers. Returns were received between October
1895 and November 1897, from over ninety schools, comprising nearly 14,000

children.

     The scheme of colours for hair and eyes was practically the same as that of
Dr, Beddoe; but his two darkest classes for hair were amalgamated into one.
Comparison with Dr. Virchow's survey of German school children would, however,
have been facilitated if blue eyes had been separated from other light eyes.

     The Pigmentation of the school children (with that of adults added for com-
parison) is shown in the following table of average results :

                                                                                         By Professor W. M. Flinders Petrie.

In written history the value of chronology lies almost entirely in Its defining the

sequence of events                                                                       and if the order of changes in                                                                             a civilisation  can                                                        be fixed, the
                                                                                      ;

reference to a scale of years is but a secondary matter.

Hitherto, only very vague and general terms, covering large periods, have been

used in naming prehistoric remains                                                                                                                                                                  and those terms referring to places and not to
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

age. The very incomplete records of discoveries make such terms the best that can

be usually attained.

But if we possessed a perfect record of an unlimited number of contemporary

groups of objects (as from tombs), all of which objects have had a time of

invention, popularity, and decay, and in use overlapped each other, it is clear

that with patience it would be possible to arrange all the series of groups in their

order of time, and so establish definite sequences among the various objects. Such

a task would be like that of reconstructing the order of an alphabet from torn-up

fragments which contained only two or three letters each, or settling the sequence

of scattered geological beds from the remains found in each.

If then a sequence can be established, a scale of notation is needed. As a scale

of years is impossible, a scale of equal activities is the most reasonable. This may

be reached by placing all the available material in order (from tombs, houses, &c.)
and then dividing it into a scale of equal parts. Such a scale, though not equal in

time, will yet give a fair unit for measuring a civilisation

    From the records of the excavations that my party have made in Egypt, we

Lave the contents of some thousands of prehistoric tombs exactly known. Every

type of vase, of stone or pottery, is defined in a corims containing over a thousand

forms, so that merely a letter and a number defines precisely what was found.

Thus, all the complexity of variations can be dealt with rigorously in a workable

condition.

The practical process for dealing with this material is by writing out the con-

tents of each grave on one slip of card ; and then sorting the cards into such order

that there shall be the minimum dispersion of each type number.

The methods of sorting the cards into the original order of the graves (as nearly

as possible), depend on various principles.

    1 Any certain superposition of graves, one later than another.
    2. Any clear and unquestionable series of changes of form or of manufacture.

(These two principles serve to fix the order of our scale, whether going forward or
backward in time.)

     3. Statistical methods ; sorting graves by the relative proportions of types in

common ·with ages before or after them. This is the way to place a large quantity

of material i^oughly in order.

     4. Method of style, t^erves to proiip in sequence the forms which are clearlv
intermediate between others, after their approximate place is already fixed by

statistics.

     5. Method of compression. The earliest and latest examples of each type to be
examined, to see if it be possible to concentrate them. Such inquiry alwaj's results
in revealing a tension between two or more types ; either oue must be earlier or
another later than in other cases, proved by tlieir occurriDg together on one slip.
The range of similar types helps to decide this.

     Practically a range in prehistoric Egypt of perhaps a thousand years (may be
half or double of that) is broken up into a scale of fifty parts of equal activities

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and we can define the age of every type of object found in that scale, as 38 to 41,
63 to 65, &c. ; these numbers may be termed sequence dates, or S.D.

     Pottery is the best material for study. But all other forms in stone, metal,
ivory, &c., are useful evidence, though more liable to transmission and to copying.

     NVe reach thus a system for the exact definition of all that we can learn on

prehistoric times : a system which can be applied to all countries where enough
material can be studied, and which will enable us to exactly state any coiTelation
discovered between the civilisation of different lands, when a sequence date of one
country can be proved equal to a given sequence date elsewhere.

                          10. On the Sources of the Alphabet.
                     By Professor W. M. Flinders Petrie.

  --The large series of si^ns used in Egypt about 2500 B.C. is now shown by
--such signs existing as far back as 5000 B.C. to be independent of the hieroglyphic

system or any derivatives of that. Similar signs in Crete show this system to
have extended to the Mediterranean by about 2000 B.C.

    On looking at the more extended forms of tbe Greek alphabet found in Karia

and Spain, about 60 signs are seen in use, representing about 43 sounds. Three-

quarters of these signs are common to the system found in Egypt and Crete.

     The only conclusion at present seems to be that signs were in use from
5000 B.C. onward, and developed by 2500 B.C. to over 100 in Egypt, of which half
survived in the fuller alphabets of Karia and Spain. The compression and
systematising of these signs were due to 27 of them being adopted for a numerical
system by the Phcenicians, and thus the alpha beta order was enforced by com-
merce on all the Mediterranean. This accounts in the only satisfactory way for
the confusion of the early Greek alphabets, and is a view forced on us by the
prevalence of these same signs long before Phoenician commerce.

               4. Fre-animistic Religion. By R. E,. Marett, M.A.

  --General Thesis. The term Religion denotes a state of mind embracing

emotional and ideal constituents, whereof the former constitute the universal and
constant, the latter the particular and variant element. iSelf- interpretation in
ideal terms on the part of the religrious emotion of the savage has found most
complete and definite expression in Animism, the ' Belief in Spiritual Beings.'

Animism, however, as compared with ' Supernaturalism,' namely, that state of
feeling almost uncoloured by ideas which is the primary form taken by man's

Awe of the Supernatural (or extraordmary), is but as the strongest sapling in a

thicket of heterogeneous growths, which, in the struggle for existence, has come to
overshadow the rest and give a character to the whole. The vagueness of primitive
* supernaturalistic ' utterance is illustrated hy,e.g., andriamanitra (Malagasy), vgai

(Masai), mana (Melanesians), walzan (North American Indians), kalou (Fijians).

A ' pre-animistic ' validity as manifestations of religion thus attaches to a variety

of special observances and cults ; and it may therefore be interesting in the case

of some of the more important of these to distinguish between the original basis
of ' supernaturalistic ' veneration and the animistic interpretation that as the result
of successful competition with other modes of explanatory conception (^notably
' Animatism,' namely, the attribution of life and will, but not of soul or spirit, to

material objects and forces) is thereon superimposed in accordance with the
tendency of the religious consciousness towards doctrinal uniformity. The author

illustrates his thesis as follows :

    --A. In regard to the Inanimate. (1) Selected instances show the transition

through ' Animatism ' and ' animatistic ' mythology to Animism in the interpreta-

tion of the religious awe felt in relation to extraordinary manifestations on the

mankind, is universal among all the native inhabitants of Burma of every race and

The subject is, however, still but vaguely understood. The Nats are of tliree

their connections. About them nothing seems to have been previously published

in England, and this paper is a preliminary attempt at an adequate representation

of them, and of the history, real or supposed, connected with them during life.
The paper was illustrated by a map in order to explain the relative position of the

places chiefly connected with the very complicated political history of Burma and

its numerous dynasties, so far as these are concerned with the stories related of the

Thirty-seven Nats. The paper was further illustrated by a lantern slide of an image

of each of the Thirty-seven Nats from the unique and authentic collection of large

carvings of them in teak wood by Burmese artists in the possession of the author.

             2. Two New Departures hi Anthropological Method.^
                              By W. H. R. Rivers, M.D.

    When in Torres Straits with the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition, two

methods were employed to record the colour of the skin quantitatively. Numerous

records were taken with Lovibond's Tintometer, and these were fairly satisfactory,
although the dark skins of the natives were found to be difficult objects to match

exactly. More satisfactory matches were made with the colour top, but this
method is open to the objection that the coloured paper discs used on the top are
liable to fade, while the glasses used in the Tintometer have the advantage of
being constant. Records were taken of the colour of various Melanesians and
Polynesians, as well as of the two races of Torres Straits. The following match

of the skin of the Mamus (chief) of Murray Island is given as an example

                   15-0° Orange + 6-0° Yellow + 7-0° White + 332-0° Black.

     The second contribution to anthropological method is the collection of social and
vital statistics by means of genealogies. In Murray Island and in Mabuiag
genealogies going back for three to live generations were compiled which included
nearly all the present inhabitants of these islands. In working out these genealo-
gies, the only terms of relationship used were father, mother, child, husband, and
wife, and care was taken to limit them to their English sense. The trustworthi-
ness of the genealogies was guaranteed by the fact that nearly every detail was
derived independently from two or more sources. It was found that these
genealogies anorded material for the exact study of numerous sociological questions
thus the system of kinship can be worked out very thoroughly by finding the
native terms which any individual applies to the other members of his family, i.e.
the subject can be investigated entirely by concrete examples, and abstract terms
of relationship derived from European sources entirely avoided. The genealogies

     ' The methods and their results wiU be published in externa in the Report of the

Expedition.

also provide a large amount of material for the study of totemism, marriage

customs, naming customs, &c.

    By this method, also, vital statistics can be collected of the past as well as of

the present. The genealogies collected in Torres Straits supply data for the study

of the size of families, the proportion of the sexes, the fertility of mixed marriages

&c. The method has the further advantage of bringing out incidentally many

facts in the recent history of the people, and of giving insight into their views on

various subjects. It is also eminently adapted to bring one into sympathy and

friendly relations with natives.

   A small amount of work on these lines was also done with natives of Tanna and

Lifu living on Mabuiag                                                                                                                  enough was  done to show  that  the  method  is  readily

applicable to other Melanesian populations, and it is hoped that it may be found

to be capable of wide application.

          Peesident of the Section-- J. N. Langlet, D.Sc, F.E.S.

The President delivered tlie following Address on Friday, September 15 :

One might suppose that Physiology, dealing as it does for the most part with

-- --structures such as nerves, and muscles, and glands vchich everyone has and has

heard of, would be eminently a science the newer aspects of which every one could

readily understand. And ia this supposition one would be encouraged by the

frequency of the references in English literature to some part of our inner

mechanism. More than a century and a quarter ago we find: 'If 'tis wrote

against anything, 'tis wrote an' please your worships against the spleen, in order
by a more frequent and more convulsive elevation and depression of the diaphragm,

and the succussations of the intercostal and abdominal muscles in laughter, to drive
the gall and other bitter juices from the gall-bladder, liver, and sweetbread of

his Majesty's subjects, with all the inimicitious passions which belong to them,
down into their duodenums.'

     It must, however, be recognised that many subjects which are most interesting
to the physiologist either involve so much special knowledge, or are so beset with
technical terms, that it is difficult to make clear to others even their general drift.

    I am not without uneasiness that my subject to-day may be found to fall

within this category. I propose to consider some relations of the nerves which

--pass from the brain and spinal cord, and convey impulses to the other tissues of the

body the motor or efferent nerves; and in especial the relations of those efferent

nerves which run to the tissues over which we have little or no voluntary control.

It is as well to say at once that none of the general conclusions which I lay before
you are encrusted with universal acceptance. One or two have been subjects of
controversy for the last fifty years others are too young to have met even with

                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

contradiction. I do not propose to give you an account of the various theories
which have been put forward on the questions I touch upon, nor do 1 piopose to

point out how far the views I advocate are due to others. I am concerned only
to state what seems to me to be the most probable view with regard to certain

problems which have been emerging from obscurity in recent years.

  --Limitations in the Control of the Nercovs System over the Tissues of the Body.

Tu view of the conspicuous manner in which nervous impidses affect every-day
life, we are perhaps apt to over-estimate the character and range of the influence
exerf^ised directly by the nervous system.

    From the early part of this century one way of regarding the body has been
to consider it as made up of tissues grouped together in varying number and

Wbamount. Each tissue has its characteristic features under the microscope.

need not enter into the question as to which of the commonly recognised tissues
of the body are to be regarded as forming a class by themselves, and which are to

--882 REPOKT 1899.

he regarded as subdivisions of a class. The point I wish to lay stress on is that

in any broad classification not moro than two tissues are known to be supplied

with approximate completeness with efferent nerve- fibres. The striated muscular

tissue, which forms, amongst other parts of the body, the muscles of the limbs and

trunk, receives in all regions nerve-tibres from the brain or spinal  cord.   And the

                                                                             ,

iinstriated muscular tissue, which forms, amongst other parts of the body, the

contractile part of the alimentary canal and of the blood-vessels, is in nearly, and

possibly in all, regions similarly supplied.

     The glandular division of epithelial tissue in some parts responds promptly and
strikingly to nervous impulses, but in some parts the response is feeble, and in
others no nervous impulse has been shown to reach the tissue. The connective
tissue which exists all over the body, and which in its varied forms of connective

--tissue proper-- cartilage, bone, teeth, epithelioid cells makes so considerable part of

it, is in mammals, so far as we know, destitute of eflerent nerve-fibres. The

epidermic cells, which form a covering for the body, the ciliated cells, the repro-

ductive cells, do not visibly respond to any nerve stimulus. And the myriads of

blood corpuscles, which in different ways are in incessant action for the general

welfare, are naturally out of range of nervous impulses. According to our present

state of knowledge, large portions of the organism live their own lives uninfluenced,
except indirectly, by the storms and stresses of the central nervous system. No
nervous impulse can pass to them to make them contract or to make them secrete,
or to quicken or slacken their inherent activity. The nervous system can only

influence them through the medium of some other tissue by changing the quantity

or quality of the surrounding fluid.
     Regarding, then, the body from the point of view of the control exercised by

the nervous system on the other constituents, we have first to recognise that this

control is in considerable part indirect only, that the several tissues are in varying

degree under direct control, and that different parts of one tissue may be influenced

by the nervous system to different extents.

  --Limitation i)i. the Control of the Nervous System over the different Activities of

the Cell. Even when nervous impulses can strikingly affect the vital activity of a

tissue, their action is limited. They cannot modify the activity in all the various

ways in which it is modified by the inherent nature of the tissue and the character

of the surrounding fluid. Thus the submaxillary gland which pours saliva into

the mouth is in life ceaselessly  taking in oxygen  and  giving  out carbonic acid it
                                                                                                                                                   ;

does this without pouring forth any secretion. So far as we know no nervous

impulse can hasten or retard this customary life of the gland by a direct action

upon it without producing other changes. The nervous system can only do tbis

indirectly by modifying the bleed supply The nervous impulse which reaches

the gland cells causes them to secrete, to take up fluid on one side and to pour it out
on the other, and it does not, and so far as we know it cannot, confine its influence

to those changes ordinarily going on in the gland cells. The essential effect of a
nerve impulse appears to be to modify the amount of energy set free as work

usually it causes work to be done, as in the contraction ot a muscle, or in the

secretion of fluid by a gland ; sometimes it diminishes the work done, as in the

cessation of a heart-beat, or the decrease of contraction of a blood-vessel. Other

changes often go on side by side with this setting free of energy as work, but

there is no unimpeachable instance in which these other changes take place by

themselves as the result of nervous excitation. Physiologists have sought for long

-- --years in all parts of the body for nerves calorific or frigorific nerves which

-- --cause simply an increase or decrease of the heat set free by a tissue ; and for nerves
   trophic nerves which cause simply chemical changes in the tissue associated

with a setting free of heat or not. Probable as the existence of such nerves seems

--to be, the search for them cannot, I think, be said to have been successful.
    Somatic or Voluntary Tissues. When we look at the question of nervous

control subjectively, and consider in ourselves what tissues are at our beck and

call, we find that we have immediate and prompt governance over one tissue only,
the one which, as we have already Been, is most universally supplied with efferent

nerve«flbres--'namely, the (fibrous) striated muscular tieeue. The parts ef the body

Wecomposed of this muscular tissue we move, as we say, at will.   exercise a

control over it that we cannot exercise over any other tissue. The tissue is

supplied with a special system of nerves. In other vertebrates there is a tissue of

similar microscopical characters, and havins- a similar system of nerves. And we

can be certain that in all vertebrates the tibrous striated muscle and the nervous

system belonging to it form a definite portion of the body which can be properly

placed in a class apart from the other tissues of the body. The tissues in this class

are spoken of as ' somadc ' tissues, or sometimes, in view of our own sensations, as

' voluntary.' ' Voluntary ' is not a word which physiologists care much to use in

this context, because it readily gives rise to misconceptions. It will serve, how-
ever, if we bear in mind that the primary distinguishing characters of the system

are microscopical, anatomical, and developmental ; that other tissues than

' voluntary ' can be put in action by the will, though in a diil'erent fashion ; and

that ' voluntary ' tissues are also put in action involuntarily. That is to say, the

word will serve if we rob it of much of its ordinary meaning.

The somatic or voluntary nervous system has in its essential features long
Webeen known.
               may leave it and pass on to a more obscure field.
--Autonmnic or Involuntary Tissues. In putting on one side the voluntary

differing microscopically from one another, which go to make up the various organs

of the body. Of the rest some, as we have said, either do not receive nerve-fibres

--from the brain and spinal cord, or, if they do, practically nothing is known about

them in our own class of vertebrates the mammalia. These I shall say a word or
two about later. For the present we must confine our attention to the tissues
which are known to be supplied not too illiberally with nerve-fibres. These are

unstriated muscle, and its allied cardiac muscle, and certain glands. Since the

voluntary striated muscle has a nervous system of its own, it might be imagined

that the unstriated tissue and the glandular tissue, diflering as they do, would also

have separate nervous systems. This, however, is not the case. The nervous

supply of these two tissues has common features and belongs to the same system.

There is, unfortunately, no satisfactory term by which to designate it. On the
whole the term ' autonomic ' seems to me best adapted for scientific use. But it

is not of the first importance for our present purpose to insist upon a proper

nomenclature, so that I think I shall not do much harm if I use the familiar

'involuntary ' for the unknown, or nearly unknown, ' autonomic'

    I need hardly point out how widespread are both the gUndular and the unstriated
muscular tissues. In man practically the whole surface of the skin is supplied with

sweat-glands, lachrymal glands lie hid behind the eye, small glands are thick in

the respiratory tract from the nose to the smaller bronchial tubes, and glands stretch
along the whole of the digestive tract. Most of these can be set in action by

nerve-fibres. There are a number of others in which such action has not been
shown, so that they do not concern us at present. Unstriated muscle, forming, as it

does, part of the walls of the arteries and veins, penetrates to every part of the

body. It forms a large part of the coats of the stomach and intestines ; it is present
in the spleen and in parts of the lymphatic vessels ; it is present in the iris and in

other parts of the eye ; it occurs in greater or less amount in different animals in

the deeper layers of the skin.

Consider some of the ways in which these tissues in the several organs or

structures aflfect the working of the body. The heart contracts and supplies the

driving force for the circulation of the blood ; the arteries contract less or more,

here or there, and regulate the amount of the blood to each region ; the digestive

tract secretes solvent and disintegrating fluids in the food, churns it to pulp,
absorbs some and rejects the rest ; the skin-glands pour out their tiny beads of
perspiration, and so aid in regulating the temperature of the body ; the iris com-
manHs the aperture of the pupil and determines the amoimt of light falling on the

retina ; the ciliary muscle, by its varying contraction, brings about the focussing

necessary for distinct vision.

., But the involuntary tissues do tiot confine themEsIyes to actions of such flagrant

utility as those just- mentioned. The contraction of email bundles of unstriated

                                                                  9&i1

muscles in the skin will cause the flesh to creep ; other similar small muscles are

attached to the hairs ; 'tis these will make

                            ' Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
                            And each particular hair to stand on end.
                               Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.'

    The involuntary tissues, although not under the prompt and immediate conliol

of the will, are under the control of the higher centres of the brain. They are

particularly responsive to the                                                                                                   emotions                                              and in so far as we can call  up emotions,
                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

we can play upon them at will. The ease with which nervous impulses pass along

given tracts depends, amongst other things, upon use. And so it appears that our

great-grandfathers wept and our great-grandmothers fainted with an ease which

we should require assiduous practice to attain.

    Further, you may note that the contraction of involuntary muscle caused by
an emotion may in its turn set up nervous impulses, which pass back to the brain

and give rise to vague and curious feelings, feelings often lending themselves to

effective literary expression :

' Where our heart does but relent, his melts ; where our eye pities, his bowells yearn.

    I must ask your forgiveness for mentioning so many well-known facts in the

sketch which I have just given of the involuntary tissues" But I hope it will take

from you all excuse ibr not understanding the rest of what I have to saj'.

    T}i£. arrangement of the involuntary nervous system presents some peculiar

characters. The most distinctive of these is that the nerves, after they leave the brain

or spinal cord, do not run interruptedly to the periphery; they end in nerve-cells,

and the nerve-cells send otf the tibre.s which run to the periphery. The most direct

proof of this lies in the fact that a certain amount of nicotine prevents the central

block on either side of the ganglia, so that it must be in them. The actual point

of attack of the nicotine appears to be the connections made by the central nerve-

hbres with the peripheral nerve-cells. Thus all nerve-impulses, which pass from

the brain or spinal cord to unstriated muscle or glandular tissue, pass through an

intermediate station on their way. In this, as in some otlier respects, the arrange-

ment of the involuntary nervous system is more complex tlian that of the voluntary

nervous sytem                                                           in the latter                                            the  motor                                            nerve-hbres run  direct  to the  tissue                                                                                                                                                                                         and

stations for the involuntary nerve-fibres are grouped together into ganglia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and so

we may call the nerve-fibres which run from the brain or spinal cord to the nerve-

cells pre-ganglionic fibres, and the nerve-fibres whicJi run from the ganglia to the

peripheral tissues post-ganglion ic nerve-fibres.

    The involuntary nervous system is divided into at least two subdivisions.

The most_e.\ tensive of these is what is called the sympathetic nervous system. The

pre-ganglionic fibres of the sympathetic arise from a limited portion of the spinal
cord. They arise from tliat part of the spinal cord which is in the region of the

chest and the small of the back i.e. roughly from the part which lies between the

origin of tlie voluntary nerves for the arms and the origin of the voluntary nerves

for the legs. The fibres given off by the ganglia of this system i.e. the post-

--ganglionic libi-es run to the involuntary tissue in all parts of the body.
   --The Cranial and Sacral Systems. The second division of the involuntary

-- --nervous^ system consists of two parts : one part the cranial arises from the

brain--I.e. above the origin of the sympathetic ; the other--the sacral--arises

Irom the end of the spinal cord-- 1>. below the origin of the sympatlietic.

    Each supplies a limited and different part of the involuntary tissue of the body,

but both together supply a portion only of it. Taking the distribution broadly,

they supply th6 muscular coats of the alimentary canal and certain structures

connected davelopmentally with the anterior and posterior portions of it. They are

especially c'linnected with these terminal portions ; tbey send numerous tierve-fibres

to  them                                   whereas                      they  send                                               but  few  to  the                                     intervening  portion,    and  none  at                                                                                                                                                                                          all  to

its blood-vessel.?. Thus parts of the involuntary tissue of the l)ody receive a

double supply of nerve -fibres, whilst parts receive a single supply only, -iuiongst

the latter are' all the involuntary tissues of the skm, the blood-vessel.s of the limbs

and trunk, and of most of the viscera.

The cranial and sacral divisions of the involuntary nervous system are con-

.sidered by some observers to he simply portions of the sympathetic system separated

from it by the development of the nerve-centres for the arms and for the It-gs. I

may give one reason why I do not take this view. The middle portion of the

spinal cord, which is the region that sends fibres to the sympatht>tic, always rends

fibres to a given spot by more than one nerve, and usually by four or five. The

fibres passing by the several spinal nerves never ditler in the kind of effect they

produce, but only in the degree of effect ; the difference is in quantity and never

in quality. If, then, regions above and below were mere separated parts of this

sympathetic region, we should expect that when one of these regions and the

sympathetic region sent nerves to the same spot, the effect produced by both sets

of nerves would be the same in kind, though it might differ in extent. But this

is often not the case. Thus certain blood-vessels may receive nerve-fibres from

four spinal nerves in the sympathetic region and from three spinal rerves in the

sacral region ; all the former cause contraction of the blood-ves>els, all the latter

cause dilation. And thus it seems to me probable that in the evolution of mam-

mals the sympathetic nerves have developed at one time, and the cranial and

sacral involuntary nerves have developed at another time.
-- AInhibition.
                 striking feature of the involuntary nervous system is its posses-

sion of nerve-fibres, which, when excited, stop some action at the time going on.

The most striking example is perhaps the cessation of the heart-beats brought

about by excitation of the vagus nerve. Such nerve-fibres are called inhibitory

nerve-fibres, and the stopping of the action is called inhibition.

So far as has been definitely proved inhibitory nerve-fibres only run to

involuntary muscle and to nerve-cells, and to these, so far as has been certainly

shown, only in particular cases. It is true that when fear or other emotion causes

the tongue to cleave to the roof of the mouth, there is a cessation of the customary

flow from certain glands, but this flow is itself the result of nervous impulses

passing in ever rising and falling intensity from the central nerve-cells, and its

cessation is due to inhibition of nerve-cells and not to inhibition of glandular cells.

     The inhibition of nerve-cells has only been proved to take place in the central

nervous system. When a group of nerve-cells of the central nervous system is

engaged in sending out nervous impulses, other nervous impulses reaching them

by way of other nerve-cells may diminish or stop their activity. The theory which

is commonly advocated now to explain this inhibition makes the activity of the

nerve-cells depend upon their receiving stimuli from the minute endings of other

nerve-cells, and the cessation of the activity to depend upon these minute endings,

either withdrawing themselves out of range, or having something interposed be-

tween them and the nerve-cells, so that the impulses can no longer pass. This

theory I do not wish to discuss to-day ; it is sufficient to say that if it is true, the

inhibition of nerve-cells is an entirely different process from that of the inhibition

of involuntary muscle.

Turning to the inhibition of involuntary muscle, there is a source ol confusion

which we must first guard against. Nearly all the imstriated muscle in the body

is kept in a state of greater or less tone, or contraction, by the central nervous

Asystem.  diminution or cessation of this contraction may then be caused by a

diminution or cessation of the activity of the central nervous system. This cef sa-

tion of contraction is, of course, not what we mean by an inhibition of the

unstriated muscle. It is usually spoken of as an inhibition of the nervous centre.

The inhibition we mean is that which is caused by stimulating the peripheral end

of a nerve outside the spinal cord.

I have said that this inhibition can only be obtained in certain cases, and it is

not easy to find anything in common with regard to these cases. But on the

whole it appears that the more a tissue is able to work by itself, the more likely it

is to be under the control of inhibitory fibres. The heart, stomach, and the
----

intestines work when no longer connentecl with the central nervous system, and

these are especially liable to inhibition.

     There has been a marked tendency amongst physiologists, in considering the

question of inhibitory nerve-fibres, to take what may be called the view of the

equal endowynent of the tissues. Because some arteries have inhibitory nerve-

fibres, therefore it is to be held as in the highest degree probable that all have.

And many would go farther and say that it is therefore in the highest degree

probable that all unstriated muscle, and glands, and even the voluntary muscles

bave such fibres. This view seems to me a mistaken one. There is hardly room

for doubt that the motor fibres are supplied in most unequal measure to the
unstriated muscle and glands of the body. There are veins in the body

containing unstriated muscle, which show no visible contraction from any nerve

--stimulation. And there are a number of glands which no nerve so far as we
--tnow excites to secretion. Since, in the course of the evolution of the organism,

a universal development of motor fibres has not occurred, it is, I think, to bo

expected that the development of inhibitory fibres should be still less universal.

For up to a certain point the results of inhibition can be obtained in most cases

without inhibitory nerve-fibres, by a simple diminution in the impidses travelling

down the motor fibres. The only, and the final, test is of course experiment.

But not all experiments are decisive, and theory inevitably colours interpretation.

This theory of the equal endowment of the tissues has, it seems to me, caused a

number of quite inconclusive experiments to be accepted as offering satisfactory

evidence for the existence of inhibitory nerve-fibres.

    Passing from this question, we may consider briefly how far we can get on the
way to understand what occurs during inhibition. The external characteristic

feature of inhibition is that a certain state of activity ceases ; a muscle contracting
at short intervals ceases to contract, or a muscle in a steady state of contraction

loses this state. The tissue in either case becomes flabby.

    The activity of a tissue may obviously be due to its receiving some stimuli from
the nervous system or to its own inherent qualities. In the former case, if the tissue
were only active when receiving nervous impulses, we should naturally look to some

interference with these impulses as being the cause of inhibition. The blood-

vessels of the submaxillary gland appear to me to offer sufficiently clear evidence

with regard to the inhibition of blood-vessels. The superior cervical ganglion is

the local centre from which the nerve-fibres bringing about contraction run to the

blood-vessels of the gland. When this ganglion has been removed and the nerve-

fibres from it have degenerated, the vessels receive no nervous impulses causing

them to contract. But stimulation of the inhibitory nerve will still cause dila-

tion i.e. inhibition of the blood-vessels. The inhibition must then be due to a

direct action on the tissue, and not to an interference with other nerve-impulses.

The evidence with regard to the inhibition of the beat of the heart and of the tone

or peristalsis of the alimentary canal is more complex, but there is good reason to

believe that the contraction is in both cases due to their inherent qualities. And

if this be granted, it follows that liere also inhibition must be due to a direct

action upon the tissue.

     The contraction of a muscle is due to a chemical change in it. In this chemical

--change some energy is set free as work shown by the contraction of the muscle

and some as heat. It is conceivable that the nervous stimulus which cuases inhi-

bition should cause all the energy set free by the chemical change to take the form of

heat. In that case the inhibitory nerve would be a calorific nerve. The amount of

chemical change is indicated by the amount of carbonic acid given off to the blood.

No experiments have been made as to the amount of carbonic acid given off" to the

blood by an inhibited tissue, but it appears very unlikelv that the amount is increased,
and we may take this view of the action of an inhibitory nerve as improbable.

If the nervous impulse does not act in this way it must in some way stop the

particular chemical change associated with contraction from takins" place. It does

not stop all chemical change, for blood passing through an inhibited tissue loses

some of its oxygen. The simplest way for a nervous impulse to prevent a

Weparticular chemical change is to induce a diflferent one.  have seen that the

--tissues which are inhibited have a great tendency to contract of themselves that

is, they form certain very unstable substances. In closely related tissues which are

not inhibited this tendency exists but little or not at ail. The proximate cause

of inhibition might then be that the nervous stimulus causes certain molecules of

the tissue to form more stable combinations. This need not be associated with any

general assimilation ; it would simply make the muscle adopt for a time a mode of

--life more like that of other closely related muscle.
     Number of Relay Stations. I have already mentioned that the nerve-fibres

which pass from the central nervous system to the involuntary tissues do not run

to it direct, but end in groups of nerve-cells or ganglia from which fresh nerve-

fibres are given off. Now, in most cases, there are anatomically several ganglia on

a nerve in its course from the spinal cord to the periphery. For example, the

nerve-fibres which cause the hairs of a cat's tail to stand on end, giving the tail the

appearance of a bottle brush, leave the spinal cord in the lower part of the back,

and enter a nerve-strand which is beaded with ganglia. They leave this strand

near the root of the tail. Between the point where the nerve-tibres enter and the

point where they leave the strand there are seven or eight ganglia. The fact

ofl'ers us a problem of some difficulty. With how many of these ganglia are the

nerve-fibres connected ?  Or, in other words, how  many  relay  stations are there
                                                                                                                                         ;

eight or one, or some intermediate number ? Further, do all kinds of involuntary

                          Fig. 1.

nerve-fibres in all parts of the body have the same number of relay stations, or do
some have one, some two, some three, and so on? It would take too long to
discuss this question here. But the experimental evidence is, I think, fairly
decisive in favour of the simple view that the nerve-impulse passes through one
relay station only. There is, however, evidence that the nerve-fibres which pass

from the spinal cord branch, so that we may take the element by reduplication of

which the involuntary nervous system is built up to be diagrammatically as

--in fig. 1.
     iiejlexes. j^nolher point of view is given by a comparison of the groups of

nerve-cells of the peripheral ganglia with the groups of nerve-cells of the brain
and spinal cord. The proper working of the body depends upon an agile response

by the cntral nervous system to what is going on in the periphery. Now the

peripheral ganglia are made up of nerve-cells and rerve-tibres which difltr less in
general characters from some of the cells of the central nervous .system than these
difler from one another. The nerve-cells of the spinal cord can receive impulses
from many groups of nerve-cells both near and remote; they do not simply receive

--impulses from one quarter alone say, the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres

but from many quarters, and notably direct from the periphery. Hence it has

been supposed that the peripheral ganglia have similar wide connections, that they
--888 REPORT 1899.

receive impulses direct from the periphery, that each is connected with other
ganglia, and that impulses received from the periphery, or elsewhere, bring separate

ganglia into co-ordinate action. And this view, which has been taken on general

grounds, has been supported by microscopical observations.
     The evidence against this view is of two kinds. In the first place, it can be

shown that in a number of individual cases the nerve-cells of one ganglion have
no connection with the nerve-cells of another ganglion, so that anything like a
universal scheme of connection is out of the question. And, secondly, it can be
shown that whenever an actiou occurs, which might be referred to such connection,
it is an action which is bound to occur in consequence of some other known
arrangement, and that therefore it is unnecessary to seek for a further cause.

    The evidence of the first kind we need not enter into ; tue evidence of the
second kind we may hastily touch on. If we accept the conclusion stated above,

that the pre-ganglionic nerve-fibres branch and the branches run to diflerent nerve-
cells, it follows that a stimulus applied to one branch will stimulate a number of
nerve-cells ; this follows since a nerve-impulse set up in any part of a nerve
travels over the whole of it. Thus actions, resembling reflex actions, will inevitably
be obtained whenever nerve-fibres are stimulated which send branches to different

ganglia. The mechanism in this case is confined to motor nerve-fibres and nerve-

cells. The action, for lack of a convenient term, was spoken of by Dr. Anderson

and myself simply as a reflex action. It is perhaps better to call it aj^seudo-

reflex action.

     Regarded from the customary point of view, a pseudo-reflex differs widely from

a reflex action. The one is brought about by stimulating an efferent or motor

fibre, and the other by stimulating an afl^erent or sensory fibre.

But suppose we compare them from another point of view. Fig. 2 is

Aa diagrammatic representation of a pseudo-reflex.                             nervous impulse passes

Blip one branch a of a cell A, passes to another branch a', so excites a cell and

Aand B is outside it in a peripheral ganglion ; whereas in the true reflex is out-

Andwhicli it takes part is a reflex or no. So that this point is irrelevant.     so it

might be urged that the one action has as good a title to be called a reflex as the

other. I do not, however, wish to insist too much on this comparison. I am

Aninclined to say, after Touchstone, '  ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own.'

     If, as some think is the case, the spinal ganglion cell receives the nerve-impulse
conveyed by the peripheral nerve process, aud iiiodities it before past-ing it on to

the central process, this establishes a distinguishing character for the true reflex.

It would be probably an axon plus dendron reflex, the pseudo-reflex being simply
an axon reflex The important known functional difference between the reflex

and the pseudo-reflex is that in the former case the nerve-endings of the primarily

afl'ected nerve-fibre are specially difl'erentiated for receiving nerve- impulses, and

in the latter case these endings are specially differentiated for imparting nerve-
impulses. And, on the whole, it is probable that the pseudo-reflex is not a normal

part of the working of the body, but comes into play only as it -were by accident.

I do not, however, regard this as quite certain.

     The pseudo-reflex I have spoken of is caused by the excitation of nerve-fibres
before they reach the ganglia i.e. of pre-ganglionic fibres. But the fibres which are
given off' by the ganglia also branch, so that it appears inevitable that we should

have in certain circumstances an action related to a reflex caused by a stimulation

set up in one of these branches spreading to the rest i.e. a spreading out of im-

pulses in post-ganglionic fibres similar to that which occurs in pre-ganglionic fibres.

--Turcing to the diagram, fig. 1, a nervous impulse set up in one branch possibly
--by a contraction of muscle-cells to which it runs would spread to other branches

and cause contraction of the muscle-cells in connection with them. You will

notice that this spreading out of impulses does not necessarily involve the stimula-

tion of any nerve-cell ; it might perhaps be distinguished as irradiation. It would,

probably, be very local in action, unless there were overlapping of the districts

supplied by the several nerve-cells, in which case a not inconsiderable spreading

out of a local contraction might take place, giving rise to a peristaltic wave.

It must be pointed out that it has been assumed that in the sympathetic nervous

system an impulse cannot pass from a motor fibre through the nerve-cell from

which the fibre arises and affect any other nerve-fibre or nerve-cell. There is good

ground for this assumption, but the experimental evidence might certainly be more

complete.

To return to our main line of argument, we have good evidence that nervous

impulses set up in one spot may affect regions more or less remote by a mechanism

which does not involve the presence in the sympathetic system of special sensory

nerve-cells with peripheral sensory nerve-endings. And so far as investigation has

gone at present, I think that all the apparent reflex actions can be explained with-

out reference to such sensory apparatus. And so I take the analogy of the peri-

pheral ganglia with the central nervous system to be misleading, and consider that

all the nerve-cells of which we have been speaking are motor nerve-cells, and

that they all conform to the simple plan shown in fig. 1. Thus the whole consists

of a duplication of one type a cell in the spinal cord which branches, each branch
                                                                                                                                                         ;

ending in a single cell ; each of these cells sends off' a nerve-fibre which branches,

the branches ending in a group of involuntary muscle or gland cells.

That I regard as the real working mechanism, but there are two reservations

to make. All the tissues of the body may be looked upon as engaged in a life-
long process of carrying out experiments, and I am prepared to believe that there
are in the bodv what may be spoken of as the residues of these natural physiological

experiments, either the beginnings of experiments which have not succeeded, or

the melancholy ends of those which once partially successful have failed later.

Such possibly may be the nerve-cells which have been described in sympathetic

ganglia as sending their nerve-fibres to other nerve-cells.

Secondly, in this account I have not included the nerve-cells which exist in the

wall of the alimentary canal, and the cells of Auerbach's aud Meissner's plexuses.

These ' enteric ' nerve-cells belong, I hold, to a system different from that of the

other peripheral nerve-cells. "With regard to their connections I do not think

anything can be said with certainty.

   --Regeneration, Specific Nerve Energy.- One other problem presented by this

involuntary system we may say a few words about. You know that when a nerve

in the hand or arm is cut  the  nerve  will  in  proper  conditions  grow again                                                and
                                                                                                                            ;

the lost feeling and the lost power over the muscles will return. The recovery is

brought about by the part of the nerve which is attached to the spinal cord growing

along its old track and spreading out as before in the muscle, skin, and other tissue.

At any rate that is the method for which there is most evidence. You may know

also that when the nerve-fibres in the spinal cord are similarly injured, they do not

recover function. Regeneration in the latter case implies that the nerve-fibres

have to form fresh endings in connection with nerve-cells. If this were more

diiiicult than the formation of nerve-endings in muscle and other non-nervous

tissues, the difference which exists as regards recovery of function between the

nerve-fibres of the limb, and nerve-fibres of the spinal cord, would be readily ex-

plainable. But recent experiments show that the nerve-fibres which run from the

--spinalcord to theperipherai ganglia i.e. pre-ganglionic fibres re-form with ease their

connection with nerve-cells, so that we may probably seek in mechanical condi-

tions for the reason of the absence of regeneration of the fibres in the spinal cord.

Possibly some way may be found of improving the mechanical conditions, and so
obtaining regeneration. That question, however, we need not enter into.

The regeneration of the pre-ganglionic nerves presents some very remarkable

features. The nerve-fibres which end in a sympathetic ganglion are rarely, if ever,

--all of one kind that is to say, they do not all produce the same effects. Thus, of

those which run to the ganglion in the upper part of the neck, some cause the eye-

lids to move apart, some cause the pupil to dilate, some cause the face to become

pale, some cause the glands of the mouth or skin to secrete, and others have other

effects. These different kinds of nerve-fibres run, in large part at any rate, to

different nerve-cells in the ganglion. There are in the ganglion several thousands

of nerve-cells closely packed together. And it would seem hopeless for each kind

of nerve-fibre as it grows again into the ganglion during regeneration to find its

proper kind of nerve-cell. Nevertheless, nearly all of them succeed in doing this.

The nerve-fibres which normally cause separation of the eyelids, or dilatation of

the pupil, or pallor of the face, or secretion from the glands, produce the same

efi'ects after several inches of their peripberal ends have formed anew.

The fact offers at first sight a striking proof of a specific difference between the

dift'erent classes of nerve-fibres and different classes of nerve-cells. Through the

matted mass formed by the delicate interlacing arms of the nerve-cells, the

ingrowing fibres pursue their tortuous course, passing between and about hundreds

of near relations until they find their immediate stock, whom they clasp with a

spray of greeting tendrils and so come to rest.

Absolute laws seem unfitted for a workaday world. For closer observation

shows that the fibres have not always this marked preference for their own stock.

The nerve- fibres of the cervical sympathetic, the nerve I have spoken of above, do

not often go astray, at any rate so far as is knowo. But they do sometimes ; thus

it may happen that some nerve-fibres which ought to find their home with nerve-

cells governing the blood-vessels, take up with nerve-cells governing the dilator

structures of the pupil.

WeAnd if we turn to other nerves, greater aberrations are found.          have seen

that the nerves running from the central nervous system to involuntary structures

may be divided into two sets : the sympathetic nerves on the one hand, and the
cranial and sacral nerves on the other. An important cranial nerve is the vagus
it causes, when in action, cessation of the heart-beat, contractionof the oesophagus,

contraction or inhibition of the stomach, and various other effects. It does not

send nerve-fibres to any of those structures of the head which we have seen the

-- --sympathetic ganglion at the top of the neck the superior cervical ganglion so

liberally supplies. And yet the vagus nerve, if it has a proper opportunity of

growing into the superior cervical ganglion, will do so, and there establish connec-

tions with the nerve-cells. Thus the nerve which properly exercises control over

certain viscera in the thorax and abdomen is capable of exercising control over

structures in the head, such as the iris, the blood-vessels, and the glands. The

details of tlie process, with which I will not trouble you, (To not afford any clear
evidence that the nerve-fibres of the vagus pick and choose amongst the nerve-

cells of the superior cervical ganglion ; the fibres appear rather to form their
terminal branches around any kind of nerve-cell, so that, in fact, the action which

the nerve-fibre will in future bring about depends not on any intrinsic character
of its own, but upon the nature of the action carried on by the nerve-cell. The

nen-e-cell may cause secretion from a gland, or contraction of a blood-vessel, or

dilation of the pupil, or movement of hairs ; whichever action it causes the nerve-

fibre which joins it from the vagus nerve can cause for the future, and it can cause

no other. In this case, tlien, we arrive at results which are hopelessly at variance

with the view that the nerve-fibres and nerve-cells of the involuntary nervous

system are divided into classes which are fundamentally different. In other words,

that theory which is spoken of as the theory of specific nerve energy does not

apply here.

    But if this is so, how are we to account for the selective power shown by the

sympathetic nerve-fibres which I have mentioned earlier ? That the different classes

of nerve-fibres and nerve-cells with which we are deahng have not those deep and

inherent diH'ereuces which are required by the theory of specific nerve-energy is,

it seems to me, certain. Nevertheless, there may be some difl'erencts of a com-

paratively superficial nature which suffice to explain the selective activity observed.

AVe may suppose that a re-growing uerve-fibre will in favourable circumstances

join a nerve-cell, the function of which is the same as that of its original cell, but

that if there are hindrances in the way of this return to normal action, and if the
conditions are favourable for joining a nerve-cell acting on sorue other tissue, why

then it will join this. It is as if it had a preference, but did not care overmuch.

We might perhaps express the facts by saying that there are difl'erent varieties of

pre-ganghonic fibres, but no species.

    We have been speaking so far of the nerve-fibres which run from the brain

and spinal cord to the peripheral nerve-cells. The nerve-fibres which run from

the peripheral nerve-cells have also, there is reason to believe, a large measure of

indifference as to the kind of work they perform. The limits of this indifference

have yet to be investigated.

I have said earhei; that in mammalia nerve-fibres are not known to run to

connective-tissue cells or to epidermic cells. But in some lower vertebrates certaui

connective-tissue cells are under the control of the central nervous system. Thus

in the frog the pigmented connective-tissue cells, which play a large part in deter-

mining the colour of the skin, can be made to contract or to rearrange their pig-

-- --ment granules and so change the coloiu' of the skin by excitation of certain

nerves. In all probability the motor nerve-fibres to the pigment-cells belong to

the same class as the nerve-fibres which run to the arteries and to the glands i.e.

Wethey belong to the autonomic system.  have seen that unstriated muscle-

cells and gland-cells in different parts of the body are by no means equally supplied

with motor nerve-fibres, and it may be that in mammals there are certain con-

nective-tissue cells which receive motor nerve-fibres. Further, if it is true, as it

well may be, that nerve-fibres which run to a gland are capable in favourable

conditions of making connections with a blood-vessel, it is not beyond hope that

either kind of nerve-fibre may experimentally, by offering it favourable conditions,

be induced to join connective-tissue cells.

     The factors which determine whether a particular tissue or part of a tissue is

eventually supplied with nerve- endings, and the degree of development of these,

are the factors which determine evolution in general. In the individual it is

exercise of function which leads to the development of particular parts ; in the

race it is the utility of this development which leads to their preservation. And so

it is conceivable that in some lower vertebrate at some time, the autonomic nervous

system may have developed especially in connection with those tissues which appear

in ourselves to be wholly unprovided with motor nerve-fibres.

    I am tempted, before ending, to make a slight digression. Those who have

occasion to enter into the depths of what is oddly, if generously, called the litera-

ture of a scientific subject, alone know the difficulty of emerging with an unsoured

disposition. The multitudinous facts presented by each corner of Natui-e form in
large part the scientitic man's burden to-day, and restrict him more and more, -willy-
nilly, to a narrower and narrower specialism. But that is not the whole of his
burden. Much that he is forced to read consists of records of defective experi-
ments, confused statement of results, wearisome description of detail, and
unnecessaiily protracted discussion of unnecessary hypotheses. The publication of
such matter" is a serious injury to the man of scien.-e ; it absorbs the scanty funds
of his libraries, and steals away his poor hours of leisure.

    Here I bring my remarks to a close. I have endeavoured to give as clearly as
possible what seem to me to be the conclusions which logically follow from certain

data, but I would not have you believe that I regard them as representing more
than the immediate point of view. As the wise man said : ' Hardly do we guess
aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that

are before us.'

                               By Ivor L. Tuckett, M.A.
     In all my experiments I have estimated the reducing power of the blood and

 urine, reckoned as glucose ; so that when the degree of hyperglycsemia or glycosuria
--

TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.  893

is mentioned, all that is meant by the expression is that the blood or ui-iuc respec-

tively contains so much reducing material, estimated as glucose. My method in

extracting the sugar from the blood has consisted in boiling with sodium sulphate,
as described by Pavy in his book on ' The Physiology of the Carbohydrates.' The
reducing power of the blood and urine I have estimated by the ammoniated
Fehling's solution recommended by Pavy, and described in the same book. I
have convinced myself of its accuracy, as in the estimation of standard solutions
of sugar I have always obtained a value correct to the first two places of

decimals.
     I have obtained the following results :

     1. That if the thoracic lymph from a dog which has been starved a day is
injected into the portal system of a cat, no glycosuria results, nor is there any
hyperglycemia beyond the degree which sometimes results from the use of

anajsthetics, that is from about "2 per cent, to "28 per cent.

     2. That if the thoracic lymph from a digesting dog is injected into the portal
system of a cat, glycosuria of a degree varying from 1 per cent, to 9 per cent, and
hyperglycaemia of a degree varying from "3 per cent, to '9 per cent, result.

     3. That if thoracic lymph from a digesting dog be injected into the systemic
circulation of a cat, hyperglycaemia and glycosuria again result, though not in as
high a degree as after portal injections ; that is, hyperglycaemia of a degree from
·3 per cent, to '5 per cent., and glycosuria of a degree from 1 to 3'75 per cent.

    4. That if the thoracic lymph from a digesting cat be injected into its own

splenic vein, hyperglycaemia and glycosuria result.
     5. That the mere injection of a few bubbles of air with a little normal salt

solution into the portal system of a cat is followed by glycosuria ; while the
injection of salt solution or of serum from dog's blood is followed by no glyco-
suria and by no hyperglycaemia, beyond the slight degree due to the anaesthetics

employed.
     6. That, as Biedl proved, the mere formation of a fistula of the thoracic duct

in a dog is followed by glycosuria ; and whereas he only experimented on the dog,
and usually obtained glycosuria of a degree not abive 2 per cent, and never
more than 5'8 per cent , I have also obtained this result in the cat ; and in a dog
which had been starved thirty-six hours I obtained glycosuria of a degree of

10"52 per cent.

    My explanation of these various results is that the internal secretion of the

pancreas passes into the blood chiefly via the thoracic lymph, while some toxic
substance, formed probably in the intestine, is present in the thoracic lymph
during digestion, but is absent therefrom during starvation, though it probably is
present also in the portal blood both during digestion and starvation. This toxic
body and the internal secretion of the pancreas are antagonistic to one another
In the absence of the internal secretion of the pancreas, this substance has a toxic
action on the glycogenic tissues of the body whereby they cannot, to the same
extent as normal, form glycogen out of sugar, and probably are stimulated to
convert glycogen into sugar.

     Thus the injection of thoracic lymph from a digesting dog causes glycosuria
because it contains the toxic substance. On the other hand, leading the thoracic
lymph away from a fasting dog is followed by glycosuria, because, the internal

secretion of the pancreas being thus removed, the toxic substance in the blood is
given free play.

      I attribute the glycosuria following the mere injection of a few bubbles of air
into the portal circulation of a cat to the fact that this air very largely accumu-
lates in the veins of the pancreas ; as a result of which the pancreas is probably
crippled in forming its internal secretion.

      'Though the above explanation is nothing more than a supposition, yet it has
very great probability in its favour, because it harmonises the glycosuria caused
by interference with the thoracic duct with the glycosuria following excision of

the pancreasj and thus gets rid of the necessity of our calling the former ' a Dew

fbrm of experimental diabetes,' as was done by Biedl.

any of the numerous observations recorded in the literature of diabetes, which is

toxic substance and the internal secretion of the pancreas beinof upset ; and 1

should be inclined to explain the majority of cases of human diabetes similarly,

seeing that several observers have proved that the internal secretion of the

pancreas is under nervous influences.

2. The Physiological Effects of Extracts of the Pituitary Body.^

      By Professor E. A. Schafer and Swale Vincent.

1. Extracts of the pituitary body, when intravenously injected, have a marked

effect upon the blood-pressure, producing, according to the nature of the extract,

either a marked rise or a marked fall. The pituitary body contains, therefore, two

active substances, one pressor and the other depressor. Of these the pressor

substance is soluble in salt solution and insoluble in absolute alchol and ether

the depressor substance is soluble in salt solution, in absolute alcohol, and in

ether. The active substances are not destroyed by boiling, and are dialysable.

2. The pressor substance produces its action both upon the heart and upon

the peripheral   arteries (confirmatory                                                                          of Oliver and  Schafer)                                           the  depressor sub-
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

stance probably mainly on the arterioles. The action of the pressor substance is

a prolonged one (confirmatory of Oliver and Schafer), and during the period of

its action a second dose is inactive or nearly so (confirmatory of Howell). The

action of the depressor substance is evanescent, and can be repeated at short

intervals.

3 The pressor effect of the extract may be accompanied by cardiac slowing.

This is probably in large part incidental to the contraction of arterioles and rise

of aortic pressure, but is in part due to direct action upon the peri])heral cardiac

mechanism (confirmatory of Oliver and Schafer, Howell, and Cleghorn).

4. The active substances are contained only in the infundibular, not in the

hypophysial part of the pituitary body (confirmatory of Howell).

6. Subcutaneous injection of the extracts in small mammals causes paralytic

symptoms similar to those obtained by injecting suprarenal extract.

6. The characteristic effects produced by extracts of the infundibular body are

probably not due to the grey nervous matter of which this is largely composed

(confirmatory of Howell).

          [From the Physiological Institute of the University of Berri\.
    It is knovm and shown in the work of N. Wedensky,- that the pitch of an

artificial muscle tone (Helmholtz) corresponds to the frequency of the stimuli
which are given to the nerve or to the muscle directly.

    A* more extended aceonnfc will be found In the^Tburn, qfPhi/eiol voli x»t, p. 1,

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.  895

    Bernstein and Sclioenlein as well as Wetlensky, who used Kronecker's tone-
Inductorium, found that when the frequency of stimuli exceeded 1,000 per

second, the muscle tone no longer corresponded with the frequency of stimuli,

but a lower tone was piven out.
     It seems to H. Kronecher, that the tone of tlie iuterruptor governing a

moderate frequency of stimuli, would not only be reproduced in the muscle with the
same pitch, but also with the same timbre and quality.

   We desired to know, whether the tones from two interruptors vibrating at

diflferent rates could be heard in the doubly stimulated muscle.

     The gastrocnemius muscle of the rabbit, irritated directly or through the sciatic
nerve, was used for stimulation with opening induction shocks of diflerent frequen-
cies, in some cases of 60 and 100 per second, and in others of 100 and 200 per

second.

    With the same intensity of current from both interruptors, in most instances,
the high tone was heard in the muscle by means of a solid stethoscope, at first

stronger than the lower tone ; but the low tone remained audible longer than the

high tone.
     In several instances, however, the low tone became inaudible before the higher

tone.

     The same result followed if the nerve was clamped in two pairs of electrodes,

the one proximal and the other distal.

    When the nerve was stimulated through the proximal electrodes, the tone was

·weaker than when it was stimulated through the distal electrodes, although the
intensity of the current, and the frequency of the stimuli remained the same in

both places.

    When the cerebrum of the rabbit had been eliminated, and the cervical cord

stimulated with induction shocks of different frequencies, there could be heard for

several seconds the deep natural muscle tone.
      Stimulation of the lumbar cord gave, in consequence of the spreading of

derived currents to the nerve roots, the artificial muscle tone.

     In another similar experiment, we heard the deep natural muscle tone for
several seconds only. When a frequency of 100 stimuli per second was used

alone, and with the same intensity of current as before, namely 10,000 units
(with three Daniel! cells, the position of the secondary coil on a convenient scale
of induction machine), a strong and increasing tetanus followed, and a loud and
distinct tone was heard which increased in strength as long as the stimulus

lasted. This note was one tone higher than that of the tuning-fork interruptor.
The same was heard Avhen the lumbar cord, and when the muscle itself was

 stimulated.

     In the dog whose cervical cord was stimulated we heard the deep natural

muscle tone, as well with 100 stimuli per second as with 60.

     When the ' action currents ' of the muscle stimulated by different frequencies were

made audible with the aid of the telephone, the same results were obtained as
when we listened to the muscle directly.

      The higher tone became inaudible before the lower tone.

2. The Propagation of Impulses in the Babbit's Heart. By H. Kroneckeb

   Cand Dr. F. BuscH. \^From the Physiological Institute at Bern!]

    W. His, jun., has cited only one fact in support of the myogene nature of the

adult heart pulse.

    At the Third Physiological Congress in Bern ^ he communicated the observation

that simple muscle fascicles could be demonstrated between the septum atriorum
and the septum ventriculorum of rabbits' hearts, and that through these fascicles,
impulses were conducted from the auricles to the ventricles.

   We have, in a number of rabbits, cut through the septum atriorum near the

·eptum of tho ventricles, from the dorsal side of the heart where His and Romberg

                                    ' Centratblatt f. Pkyiiologie, ix. p 469
--896 REPOKT 1899.

ha\o placed their couductiiig fibres. Ai'tor tliis lesion the auricles and veutricles
continued to heat in coordination as before. After cutting most of the apex
away from thehase, but still leaving a large number of connecting fibres, the apex
ceased to beat while the base continued to pulsate.

     If now the septum ventriculorum of the base was incised in several places, the

base either ceased to beat entirely or the bases of the two ventricles pulsated

incoordinately.

     These facts cannot be explained by the theory of the myogene nature of the

heart pulsation.

     Also, we cannot understand, however slow the conduction in a muscle may be,
how the pause between the contraction of the auricles and the ventricles can be

thus explained.

     It is also impossible to explain by the myogene theory the fibrillation of the dog's
heart after a mechanical lesion of a very small region in the septum ventriculorum,

where we must place the vasomotor centre of the coronary arteries.

3. Concerning Fihrillation and Pulsation of the Dog^s Heart. By Dr.

      F. C. BusCH. \_From the Physiological Institute of the University oj

      BernJ]

     Dr. Busch observed the excised dog's heart, which was still beating weakly
after being cut out, to pulsate when perfused through the large descending branch
of the left coronary artery with a mixture of equal parts of defibrinated dog's
blood and 0-6 per cent, salt solution at 38° 0.

     The contractions were at first irregular and weak, but became regular, stronger,
and more frequent as the perfusion continued.

     AVhen the muscle was tetauised, it iibrillated only during the excitation.
     This result agrees with observations made by Porter.
     In other cases we found that the part of the dog's heart which was perfused
with a mixture of equal parts of defibrinated calves' blood and 0-0 per cent, salt
solution, fibrillated for twenty minutes, and then pulsated for seven to forty minutes,
at first irregularly, then regularly, then at long intervals, and finally only upon
stimuhition. If, however, the ventricle was fed through a coronary artery in a
normal manner with normal dog's blood, by means of uniting the coronary directly
with the femoral or carotid of another dog, the pulsations continued only so long
as the coordination apparatus was not disturbed.
     As soon as the vasomotor centre in the septum ventriculorum was stimulated
either through a stab or through electrical excitation, the venti'icle began to
fibrillate and continued without recovery.
     If, after the circulation of normal blood, various abnormal mixtures 'were used,
the same heart began, in most case.«, to pulsate, more or less regularly.
     In one instance we saw the dog's heart which was being perfused with normal
blood, Hbrillate for twenty-three minutes, and then, upon perfusing with equal parts
of warmed defibrinated blood from the same dog and 0"6 per cent, salt solution, to
continue fibrillation for fifty-eight minutes more.
      Perfusion with simple normal .salt solution failed to preserve either fibrillation
or pulsation. The parts perfused became cedematous, and failed to beat, while
neighbouring parts, not supplied with salt solution, continued to contract.

   A flap of the left ventricle which had been dissected away from the rest of the

Avail so as to remain connected only by muscle at its base, and by its artery and
veins, pulsated with a slower rhythm, than the rest of the heart.

     After the vessels supplying this flap had been tied, the ventricle was caused

caused to fibrillate ; the flap continued to pulsate as before.
     In another case the flap fibrillated with the ventricle, but resumed pulsations

after the ligature of its vessels.
     In the third similar experiment, the flap continued to fibrillate after the ligature

of its vessels.

     4. On the Effects of Successive Stimulation of the Visceromotor and

      Vasomotor Nerves of the Intestine. Ihj J. L. BuNcii, D.Sc, M.D.

     "When tlio contractions of tlie circular and loiiijitudinal coats of tlic same
segment of small intfsliuc are recorded topellicr, stimulation either of the vagus
or of the splanchnic produces the same eflect on both coats, but when the con-
tractions of two different segments are recorded, the circular coat of one and the
longitudinal coat of the other, the result of stimulation is not necessarily the same
on both. Successive stimulation of the vagus and splanchnic nerves with the
same strength of current shows some diflerences according to the order in which
the two nerves are stimulated. Though the effect produced by a preliminary
stimulation of the splanchnic can be modified or even overcome by subsequent
excitation of the vagus, Avhen such excitation normally gives rise to an effect
opposed to that brought about by the splanchnic, a reversal of the oi-der of

.stimulation does not give risa to a similar result, anti a secondary stimulation of
the splanchnic cannot, as a rule, equally modify the effect produced by preliminary

vagus excitation.
     The vasomotor effects which Francois Franck and Ilallion have ascribed to the

vagus, I have, in a somewhat prolonged series of experiments, been unable to

confirm.

5. On Stimulation and Excitability of the Ancemic Brain, By "William

     J. GiES. \Froiii the Physiological Institute of the University of

      Bern.^

The research indicated by this subject was conducted in the Physiological

Institute at Bern, upon the suggestion and under the constant direction of Pro-

fessor Kronecker. Our aim was to determine definitely the sequence of events

during perfusion of various so-called indifferent solutions through the brain, the

data thus obtained to afford a starting-point for future research with such liquids

as may be found to exert specific and characteristic influences.

In this report I shall present only the briefest outline of the experiments and

the results obtained.

The animals employed were toads, frogs, rabbits, and dogs.

The solutions used were various strengths of pure sodium chloride, Ringer'a

solution and Howell's modification of it ; Schiicking's solution, both of calcium and

sodium saccharate, and serum.

The perfusion in the cold-blooded animals was conducted with the least possible

pressure through the abdominal vein. All of the various solutions already

enumerated, except the serum, were used. "VVe made thirteen experiments (seven

with toads and si.x with frogs), each of which continued for a period of two to

eight hours, with a total transfusate of 250 to 1,600 c.c.

During the period of perfusion the following functions gradually weakened and

then usually disappeared in this  order :  («) Respiration ;  (&)  Skin reflex                                             (c)  Lid
                                                                                                                        ;

reflex (rf) Nose reflex (e) Heart beat.
                         ;;

The time of disappearances of these functions varied with the total length of

the experiments, and apparently also with the amount of fluid transfused.

Convulsive extension of the limbs occurred in all of the experiments in the

earlier stages, but toward the close of each, and before the reflex movements of

the eyelids ceased, no such manifestations could be induced.

In passing it should be noted that:

     (rt) All of the animals became edematous ; even those in which perfusion took
place at the lowest possible pressures and for the shortest periods.

     (/') Also, that it was impossible to entirely remove the blood corpuscles, even
when the perfusion continued uninterruptedly for eight hours, and as much as
1,GOO c.c. of fluid had slowly passed througli the body. In all cases the fluid
flowing from the canula, and particularly that pressed from the heart and brain,
contained quite an appreciable number of red and white corpuscles.

898 REPORT-- 1899.

   We carried out fourteen experiments with rabbits and three with dogs, all of

the previously mentioned fluids having been used.
      Ligaturing, either in the neck or in the chest, the arteries to the brain, before,

or simultaneously with, the beginning of the perfusion, brought on convulsions

immediately. Even when the perfusion had been begun shortly before the arterial
blood was completely shut off, it remained impossible to prevent convulsions and

quickly ensuing death.

      Finally, instead of closing the arteries to the brain, the abdominal aorta, vena

cava and vena porta were tied off and the heart's action utilised to pump the liquid
through the brain, the perfused fluid going into the heart by one jugular and from
the brain through the other. By this method anoemia could also be induced, con-

vulsions entirely prevented, and life considerably prolonged.

     As in the experiments with the cold-blooded animals, there was in these also a

fairly regular disappearance of functions, the intervals appearing to vary with the

total time of perfusion. With all of the solutions, including serum, both in the
rabbits and in the dogs, the order of cessation usually was : (a) Ilespiration
(b) Lid reflex (c) Nose reflex (d) Heart beat.

                                                                    ;;

     In some of the experiments, it should be noted, the nose and lid reflexes ceased
at practically the same instant. In a few, also, it was impossible to determine the
sequence of termination of these two and respiration.

     In a single special experiment with a smaU dog (5 kilos), 200 c.c. of blood was
taken, and an equal quantity of horse serum immediately afterwards was trans-
fused to take its place. This process was repeated three times at intervals of half
an hour. After the foiu'th withdrawal of fluid, the dog ceased to breathe, and
did not recover when the serum was transfused. Aside from variations in heart
action and respiration, there were no special functional changes until the end,
when respiration suddenly ceased, and the other functions quickly disappeared in
the order of the other experiments. Death was neither preceded nor accompanied

by convulsions.
     The more important conclusions of this preliminary research are :

    1. When the brain is subjected to acute antemia produced by the ligature of

its arteries or by the transfusion of indifferent solutions such as physiological
saline. Ringer's, Schiicking's and also serum, its functions are not maintained (and

convulsions ensue, but may be prevented by producing gradual instead of acute

anaemia).

2. In gradual anaemia of the brain, as induced in these experiments, the

following functions cease, usually in  this  order :  («)  Eespiration                                                 (6)  Lid reflex

    (Esophagus. By W. Muhlberg, of Cincinnati. [From the Physio-

     logical Institute of the University of £ern,^

     The course and function of the branches of the superior laryngeal nerve which
are distributed to the cervical part of the oesophagus are already well known from
the researches of Liischer. The distribution of the vagi in the thoracic part has,

so far as we are aware, not been hitherto investigated.
     I have previously shown by dissection the mode of branching of the vagi on

the oesophagus of the dog and rabbit.

    The fimctions of these nerves have now been investigated by me in conjunction

with Professor Kronecker on etherised curarised animals. The following is

summary of tlie results obtained regarding tlie action of the parts concerned under

these conditions :

     1. Water placed in the mouth does not give rise to swallowing movements.
     2. Stimulation of the superior laryngeal (central end) produces no movements
of the pharynx and upper part of the oesophagus, but the larynx is sometimes
slightly elevated. During the stimulation the thoracic and oesophageal parts of
the gullet are slightly drawu up. About two seconds «/;?«· stimulation contraction

--of the cardia occurs often quite a strong one.

     3. Similar phenomena attend stimulation of the central end of either vagus.
     4. Stimulation of the peripheral end of the vagus also frequently causes con-
traction of the same parts, but only after eight to ten seconds.
     6. Direct stimulation of the cardia causes it to contract. During this observa-
tion the artificial respiration was suspended in order the better to observe the
movements of the cardia. If this suspension of respiration was long continued the
slight automatic movements of the cardia became increased in amount.
    6. With vagus stimulation there was contraction of the pylorus without any

inhibition.

2. Observations, Physiological and Pharmacological, on the Intestinal Move-

    ments of a Dog loith a Vella Fistula. By J. E. Esselmont. \From

     the Physiological Institute of the University of Bern.^

                    Physiological Observations.

I. The rhythm of the ' pendulum movements ' (Bayliss and Starling) was

extremely regular, the frequency of ten to twelve per minute being preserved in

the fasting and feeding animal, with or without peristalsis. Occasionally the

frequency rose to eighteen and twenty per minute. The movements were then

irregular, and suggested the interference of two distinct sets of waves.

The great variation in size of these pendulum movements, which occurred from

time to time, did not correspond to variations in the rate of peristalsis. With the

most rapid peristalsis the waves were small, probably masked by the tonic

intestinal contraction around the balloon sound used for recording purposes.

II. Peristalsis, under diiferent conditions, varied from  to 22i cm. per

minute. The normal average rate, twelve to twenty hours after food, was about

^ cm. per minute, but wide variations occurred from hour to hour and day to day.
     Antiperistalsis was never observed. Transient increase of peristalsis appeared

after deglutition. After a full meal peristalsis remained depressed for three to six

hours or more.

After slight exercise a transient well-marked increase of peristalsis occurred.

More prolonged exercise had, as a rule, no further effect than that following slight

exercise. When pushed to the point of moderate fatigue, some retardation of the

movements occurred. After emotion a marked increase constantly occurred, but

lasted for only a few minutes. Light sleep seemed to have no decided effect on

the movements.

                    Pharmacological Observations.

     'V\^len certain purgatives, chiefly derivatives of aloe (kindly furnished to me,
and their chemical properties determined by Professor Tschirsch) were given to the
dog, by mouth, the doses required to produce purgation were approximately the

game as those required for a man of ten times the dog's weight.

   A phase of increased peristalsis in the fistulous loop usually preceded the

onset of purgation by several hours.

   --The substances investigated were barbaloin, its three derivatives aloe-emodin,
--alochrysin, alonigrin and also, nataloin and chrysophanic acid.

     Tlie experiments went to show that barbaloin, with its derivatives, and chryso-
phanic acid, which probably all agree chemically in possessing the anthracene
nucleus in their molecules, agree also pharmacologically in possessing marked

                                                                                            3M2

purgative propertie.'. Nataloin, whose molecule does not possess the anthracene
nucleus, is inactive I'or man, and has but very slight action in the dog.

     The most active were aloe-emodin and alochrysin, either when given by the
fistula or by the mouth, while barbaloin itself, although freely soluble, appeared to
be active only when given by the mouth, and not when given through the fistula

direct. It apparently requires to be split up under the action of the alkaline

intestinal juice.

        3. On Respiration on Mountains. By Dr. Emil Burgi.

      [From the Physiological Institute of the University of Bern.'\

    At Professor Kronecker's advice, Dr. Burgi has continued the investigations on
the above subject, the earlier results of which were communicated to the Physio-

logical Congress in Cambridge, 1898. In these experiments he found that, for
equal amounts of work performed at the foot and on the top of the Brienzer Roth-
horn, the CO2 output was greater in the latter case. After seven days' training on
the mountain this difference disappeared.

     This year Dr. Burgi has repeated this experiment on the Gornergrat railway,
since the experiments could here be carried out at a height (.3,035 metres) at which

* mountain sickness ' is frequently observed.
     The C0,, outputs by rest and work at the foot of the Brienzer Rothhorn (650 m.)

were compared with the output under similar conditions on the top of the Gorner-

grat (about 3,000 m.).

          He expired, at rest, during 12 minutes at 650 m. 31 gm. COj

    He then repeated the experiments previously carried out on the Brienzer

Rothhorn, but with varying steepness, and therefore severity of work.

           6. The Vascular MechaM.ism of the Testis.

          By Walter E. Dixon, M.D., B.Sc. London.

     The method adopted was the Plethysmoc^raphic, both testes being rapidly
shelled out, and, after incising or removiun- the tunica vaginalis, enclosing them

in a gutta-percha oncometer. The animals used were mainly dogs and cats,

although rabbits and goats were occasionally employed. By this method it was

shown that the testis undergoes changes in volume passively as a result of altera-

tions in blood pressure, and active changes due to vasomotor nerves.
     The following were the main conclusions which were drawn :

1. Operations involving the testis are usually followed by some vascular disturb-

ance, the blood pressure falling and the heart beating more feebly.

2. The sympathetic filaments in the spermatic cord may be divided into three

groups according to the effect produced'on the testis whilst stimulating their

peripheral end, viz. :  (a) vaso-coustrictors                                                                                                 {b) vaso-dilators                                                                               (c)  those producing
                                                                                                                                           ;                                                                                               ;

no alteration in volume, these probably being atferent fibres associated with

testicular sensation.

     3. The vaso-constrictor nerves to the testis were traced and shown to pass
mainly through the anterior roots of the thirteenth dorsal and first and second

lumbar nerves in the dog. There is still some doubt with regard to the position

of the vaso-dilators.
      4. Injections of testicular extract produce a different eilect in different animals

in the cat there is a fall of blood-pressure with marked inhibition, whilst in the
goat there is a considerable rise without the inhibition. The chief active con-
stituent is nucleo-proteid. In every case the ultimate effect on the testis is one of

dilatation.

   --5. The substances having the most marked effect on testicular volume were the

following :

  --(a) Gold Cliloride. In small doses there is comparatively little effect on

blood pressure. The testis first contracts and then gradually dilates, the dilated

condition being considerable and permanent.

   --{h) Cantharidin. In very small doses ('001 gramme to an animal of three or

mfour kilos) there is first a rise pressure with slowing, followed by a very insignifi-

cant fall ; the intestinal area is dilated, and the testes and kidneys undergo marked
constriction. This active testicular constriction is greater and more prolonged

than that which could be produced with any other substance, and is followed by a

stage of very considerable dilatation.
--A(c) Valerian.
                        concentrated infusion in medicinal doses produces ultimately

a passive slight testicular dilatation.
     {d) Anhalonnine produces an entirely passive dilatation of testis as a result of

--rise in blood pressure.
     (e) Other substances. The following substances all produced some testicular
dilatation, generally insignificant : strychnine, cannabis indica, amyl nitrite, ergot,

alcohol.

1. The Dependence of the Tonus of the Muscles of the Bladder in Babbits on

    the Spinal Cord. By John P. Arnold, Philadelphia. \From the

      Physiological Institute of the University of Bern.^

     I. The tonus of the Sphincter is normally greater than that of the Detrusor.
    1. The Sphincter may be so strongly contracted as to withstand, at first, a water
pressure of 38"2 cm. In other cases it may only withstand a pressure of 17 cm.
     2. The Detrusor tonus in a moderately filled bladder, soon after catheterisation,

may be as high as 31'4 cm. water pressure. On the other hand the tonus of the
Detrusor in a moderately filled bladder may be as low as 3'5 cm.

     3. Normally the Sphincter tonus remains tolerablj' constant between 25 cm.

and 30 cm., but may vary between 31 cm. and 383 cm., as observed in one

rabbit, or between 17 cm. and 24 cm. as observed in another.
     4. The tonus of the moderately filled bladder is normally between 4 cm. and

5 cm. water pressure. The tension rises in proportion to the fulness.
     5. Under high pressure both the Sphincter and the Detrusor make rhythmic

contractions at irregular intervals.

      II. After shutting off' the blood supply from the lower part of the spinal cord
by compression or ligation of the abdominal aorta, the tonus of the Sphincter and
of the Detrusor sinks rapidly.

     1. The tonus of the Sphincter falls at once very rapidly, quite low, then
gradually, until all tonus is lost. In one animal the tonus of the Sphincter did
not begin to fall until twelve minutes after ligation of the aorta. In this case the
aorta was ligated just above its division.

    2. The Sphincter may still retain a small degree of tonus as long as 1^ hour

after death.

     3. The tonus of the Detrusor falls more slowly than that of the Sphincter.
     4. In one experiment we observed, after swallowing movements produced by

stimulation of both superior laryngeal nerves, a rapid sinking of the Sphincter
tonus.

      6. Physical disturbances, such as loud noises, lower the tonus of the Sphincter.

     In our experiments normal salt solution, kept at a constant temperature between
39° and 41° C., was used in the bladder. Before passing the catheter the penis
was rendered antesthetic by a 5 per cent, solution of cocain.

      Animals which were killed by bleeding or by section between the medulla
and cerebellum gave similar results to those observed after ligation or compression
of the aorta. After section above the medulla artificial respiration was used.
During this period the Sphincter tonus fell more slowly.

and 5 centimetres broad, painted white in front with a prcj centre fjradually
diminishing in shade to white towards the extremities. This is revolved at its
centre by an electric motor provided with a means of countinjx its revolutions, and
worked by means of a tive-cell electric storarre battery. The lath is placed 1
metre 14 centimetres from the nozzle of a projection lantern, in which there is a

lantern slide representing a statue or other definite figure. On the lath at rest a
small portion of the lantern image is projected and focussed. When the lath is

revolved rapidly at about 318 revolutions per half-minute, the whole picture appears
standing out boldly in space and in relief, and at this rate of revolutions is steady.

The persistent image, however, is visible, thougli not steady, at much lower rates

of revolution, the lowest rate being a matter of individual capacity. B}' ascer-
taining tlie rate of revolutions of which eacli person can just see persistence his

particular capacity is calculated.

     Tables containing the results of a hundred tests with G7 persons were shown.
One of these gave a group of 25 tests with persons of both sexes and various ages
and classes. The low rate of 27 revolutions per half-minute was taken as the

lowest limit for the tests.
     Another table of special interest gave tests of 26 schoolboys before and after

the bodily fatigue produced by running. The persistence of every subject was
altered by running, except one, who registered the same in each case. The record
of seven was lowered, bnt that of nineteen was heightened, showing that bodily
fatigue tends to prolong persistence of vision, which seems to be the tendency of

illness.

   A third table showed tests nndca- the liglit of different colours ; the raj-s from the

lantern passing through red, green, and violet glasses. It also showed tests of

three persons before and after retinal rest.

The question of persistence of vision in relation to its duration in different

individuals and in the same individual under ditlerent circumstances, appears to

have an important bearing on modern rapid visual signalling. In reading the

signals the signaller has to discriminate between real and incidental images, and

his shai-p reading of dots and dashes will depend upon the persisting capacity of

Ahis retina.  good signaller is likely to be one whose persistence of vision is

abnormally low, a bad signaller one whose persistence of vision is abnormally

high. The aerial graphoscope affords a means of testing signallers as to their

capacities of persistence of vision, and of selecting the fittest. For this purpose

it has lately been installed in the school of signalling at Aldershct.

                          THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15.

     The President delivered the following Address:

                   A Sketch of the History of Indian Botany.

The earliest references in literature to Indian plants are, of course, those which

occur in the Sanskrit classics. These are, however, for the most part vague and

ohscure. The interest which these references have, great as it may he, is not
scientific, and they may therefore be omitted from consideration on the present
occasion. The Portuguese, who were the first Europeans lo appear in India as
conquerors and settlers, did practically nothing in tlie way of describing the plants
of their Eastern possessions. And the first contiibution to the knowledge of the
Botany of what is now British India was made by the Dutch in the shape of the
* Hortus Malabaricus,' which was undertaken at the instance of A'an Rheede,

governor of the territory of Malabar, which during the latter half of the seven-
teenth century had become a possession of Holland. This book, which is in
twelve folio volumes and is illustrated by 794 plates, was published at Amsterdam
between the years 1GS6 and 1703, under the editorship of the distinguished
Botanist Commelyn. "S'an Rheede was himself onl^' a Botanical amateur, but he
had a great love of plants and most enlightened ideas as to the value of a correct
and scientific knowledge of them. The 'Hortus Malabaricus' was based on speci-

mens collected by Brahmins, on drawings of many of the species made by Mathseus,
a Carmelite missionary at Cochin, and on descriptions originally drawn up in the

vernacular language of Malabar, whicli were afterwards translated into I'ortuguesfr
by Corneiro, a Portuguese official in Cochin, and from that language finally done

into Latin by Van Douet. The whole of these operations were carried on under

the general superintendence of Casearius, a missionary at Cochin. Of this most
interesting work the plates are the best part ; in fact, some of these are so good
that there is no difficulty in identifying them with the species which they are-
intended to represent. The ne.\t important contribution to the Botanical literature-
of Tropical Asia deals rather with the plants of Dutcli than of British India. It

was the work of George Everhard Rumph (a native of Hanover), a physician and
merchant, who for some time was Dutch consul at Amboina. The materials for

this book were collected mainly by Rumphius himself, and the Latin descriptions^
and the drawings (of which there are over one thousand) were his own work.
The book was completed in 1690, but it remained unpublished during the author's

lifetime. Rumph died at Amboina in 1706, and his manuscript, after lying for

thirty years in the hands of the Dutch East India Company, was rescued from
                      TllANSACTiONS OF SECTION K.  905

otlivion by Professor John Barman, of Amsterdam (commonly known as the

elder Burman), and was published under the tiile of * Herbarium Amboinense,'

in seven folio volumes, between the years 1741 and 1755. The illustrations of

this work cover over a thousand species, but they are printed on 6DG plates.

These illustrations are as much inferior to those of Van Rheede's book as the de-

scriptions are superior to those of the latter. The worlis of Plukeuet, published

in London between KiOG and 1705, in quarto, contain figures of a number of

Indian jilants which, although small in size, are generally good portraits, and

therefore deserve mention in an enumeration of botanical books connected with

British India. An account of the plants of Ceylon, under the name 'Thesaurus

Zeylanicus,' was published in 1737 by John Burman (the elder Burman), and in this

work many of the plants which are common to that island and to Peninsular India

are described. Burman's book was founded on the collections of Paul Hermann,

who spent seven years (from 1670 to 1677) exploring the Flora of ("eylon at the

expense of the Dutch East India Company. The nomenclature of the five books

already mentioned is all uni-nominal.

Hermann's Cingalese collection fell, however, sixty years after the publica1ior>

of Burman's account of it, into the hands of Linnteus, and that great systematist

published in 1747 an account of such of the species as were adequately represented

by specimens, under the title 'Flora Zeylanica.' This Hermann Herbarium, con-

sisting of 600 species, may still be consulted at the British Museum, by the

trustees of which institution it was acquired, along with many of the other treasures

possessed by Sir Joseph Banks. Linnreus's 'Flora Zeylanica' was followed in

--1768 by the ' Flora Indica ' of Nicholas Barman (the younger Barman) an inferior

production, in which about l,o9U species are described. The Herbarium on whicb

this ' Flora Indica ' was founded now forms part of the great Herbarium Beles-

sert at Geneva.

The active study of Botany on the binominal system of nomenclatm-e invented

by Linuocus was initiated in India itself by Koenig, a pupil of that great reformer

and systematist. It will be convenient to divide the subsequent history of Botanic

science in India into two periods, the first extending from Koenig's arrival ia

India in 1768 to Sir Joseph Hooker's arrival in 1848 ; and the second from the latter
date to the present day.

     The pioneer John Gerard Koenig was a native of the Baltic province of Courland,

He was a correspondent of Linureus, whose pupil he had formerly been. Koenig went

out to the Danish Settlement at Tranquebar (150 miles south of Madras) in 1768,

and at once began the study of Botany with all the fervour of an enthusiasm which

he succeeded in imparting to various correspondents who were then settled near

him in Southern India. These friends formed themselves into a society under the

name of ' The United Brothers,' the chief object of their union being the promotion

of Botanical study. Three of these brothers, viz. Heyne, Klein, and Pvottler, were

missionaries located near Tranquebar. Gradually the circle widened, and liefore

the century closed, the enthusiasm for Botanic research had spread to the younger

Presidency of Bengal, and the number of workers had increased to about twelve,

among whom may be mentioned Fleming, Hunter, Anderson, Berry, John, Rox-

burgh, Buchanan (afterwards Buchanan-Hamilton), and Sir "William" Jones, so well
known as an Oriental scholar. At first it was the custom of this brotherhood

merely to exchange specimens, but gradually names began to be given, and speci-
mens, both named and unnamed, began to be sent to Botanists of established
reputation in Europe. Many plants of Indian origin came thus to be described by

Retz, Roth, Schrader, Willdenow, Vahl, and Smith. Rottler was the only member

of the band who himself published in Europe descriptions of any of the new species

of his own collecting, and the.se appeared in the 'Nova Acta Acad. Nat. Curio-
Asoruui ' of Berlin.
                      little later Sonnerat and other Botanists of the French Settle-

ment at Pondicherry sent large collections of plants to Paris, and these were followed

at a considerably later date by the collections of Lescbenhault. These French col-

lections were described chiefly by Lamarck and Poiret. Hitherto Botanical work in

India had been more or less desultory, and it was not until the estaWishment in 1787

of the Botanic Garden at Calcutta that a recognised centre of Botanical activity was-
906 KEPORT-- 1899.

established in British India. Robert Kyd, the founder of that Garden, was more of

a gardener than a Botanist. He was, however, a man of much energy and shrewd-

ness. The East India Company was still in 1787 a trading company, and a large
part of their most profitable business was derived from the nutmegs and other
spices exported from their settlements in Penang, Malacca, Amboina, Sumatra, and
other islands of the Malayan Archipelago. The Company were also in those days
the owners of a fine fleet of sailing vessels, and the teak of which these ships were
built had to be obtained from sources outside the Company's possessions. The
proposal to found a Botanic Garden near Calcutta was thus recommended to the
 Governor of the Company's settlements in Bengal on the ground that, by its meanSj
the cultivation of teak and of the Malayan spices might be introduced into a
 province near one of the Company's chief Indian centres. Kyd, as a Lieutenant-
Colonel of the Company's engineers and as Secretary to the Military Board at

Calcutta, occupied a position of considerable influence, and his suggestion evidently
fell on no unwilling ears ; for the Government of Bengal, with the promptitude to
accept and to act on good advice in scientific and semi-scientific matters which has

characterised them from the day of Kyd until now, lost no time in taking steps to

find a site for the proposed garden. Colonel Kyd's official proposal was dated
June 1, 1786, and, in a despatch dated August 2, the Calcutta Government recom-
mended Kyd's proposal to the Court of Directors in London. Posts were slow and
infrequent in those days, and the Calcutta Government were impatient. They did
not wait for a reply from Leadenhall Street, but in the following July they boldly
secured the site recommended by Colonel Kj'd. This site covered an area of
300 acres, and the whole of it, with the exception of thirty acres which were sub-
sequently given up to Bishop Middletou for an English college, still continues

under cultivation as a Botanic Garden. Kyd died in 1793, and in the same year his

place as Superintendent of the Garden was taken by Dr. William Roxburgh, a young
Botanical enthusiast, and one of Koenig's ' United Brotherhood.' Roxburgh had
studied Botany in Edinburgh, where he was a favourite pupil of Dr. Hope. Desirous
of seeing something of foreign countries, he made several voyages to Madras in
ships belonging to the Honourable East India Company. In 1776 he accepted an
appointment in the Company's Medical Establishment, and was posted to the
town of Madras, where he very soon made the acquaintance of Koenig. Roxburgh
was shortly after transferred to a remote district, a good deal to the north of
Madras, then named the Northern Circars. The station of Samulcotta, which
formed Roxburgh's headquarters during his sojourn in the Circars, stands on the
edge of a hilly region possessing a very interesting Flora, and this Flora he explored
with the greatest ardour; and as part of the result of his labours an account of
some of the most interesting of its plants was published in London, at the East
India Company's expense, in three large folio volumes under the title ' The Plants
of the Coast of Coromandel.' This was Roxburgh's earliest publication on a large
scale. The first part of this book appeared in 1795, and the last not until 1819,
i.e. five years after the author's death. The increased facilities afforded to
Roxburgh after his transfer to a comparatively well-equipped institution like that
at Calcutta induced him at once to begin the preparation of descriptions of all the

plants indigenous to British India of which he could procure specimens. And so

diligently did he work that, when he was finally driven from India by ill-health in

1813, he left complete and ready for publication the manuscripts of his
' Flora Indica ' and of his ' Hortus Bengalensis ' (the latter being an enumeration of

the plants in cultivation in the Calcutta Garden). He also left admirable coloured

drawings (mostly of natural size) of 2,533 species of plants indigenous to India.

Seldom have twenty years yielded so rich a Botanical harvest ! Dr. Roxburgh was
thus the first Botanist who attempted to draw up a systematic account of the
plants of India, and his book, which is on the Linnaean system, is the basis of all
subsequent works on Indian Botany and until the publication of Sir Joseph

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

Hooker's monumental ' Flora of British India ' it remained the only single book
through which a knowledge of Indian plants could be acquired. Roxburgh was

immediately succeeded in the Calcutta Garden by Dr. Buchanan- Hamilton, a man
of many accomplishments, who had travelled from Nepal in the North to Ava and
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                            907

Mysore in tlie South, accumulating materials for a Gazetteer of the Honourable

Company's possessions. Dr. Buchanan was a Zoologist as well as a Botanist. He

had published a Aaluable account of Mysore, Canara, and Malabar, and had collected

materials for a work on the Fishes of India, besides having accumulated a large
Herbarium, part of which may now be consulted at the University of Edinburgh,
Prior to his death Buchanan-Hamilton had begun to write a learned commentary
on Yan Rheede's ' Hortus Malabaricus.' Many of his Nepalese collections were de-
.scribed in 1825 (a few years before his own death) by Don in his ' Prodromus Florae

Nepalensis.' Buchanan-Hamilton remained only one j^ear at Calcutta, and in

1815 he was succeeded by Nathaniel Wallich, a native of Copenhagen, who, prior
to his appointment to the Calcutta Garden, had been attached as surgeon to the
Danish settlement at Serampore, twenty miles higher up the llooghly. Wallich
remained Superintendent of the Calcutta Garden for thirty years. In 1846 he went

to England, and in 1854 he died. During his tenure of office in the Calcutta Garden,

"VVallich organised collecting expeditions to the then little-knowu regions of

Kamaon and Nepal (in the Himalaya), to Oudh, Eohilcund, Sylhet, Tenasserim,
Penan"-, and Singapore. He personally undertook in fact a botanical survey of a

large part of the Company's possessions in India. The vast materials thus collected
under his own immediate direction, and the various contributions made by others,

were taken to London by him in 18'J8. With these were subsequently incorporated
the collections of Russell, Klein, Heyne, Rottler, Buchanan-Hamilton, and Rox-
burgh. And by the help of a band of distinguished European Botanists, among

whom may be named De Candolle, Kunth, Lindley, Meissner, Nees von Esenbeck,

Von Martins, and Bentham (the latter in a very special manner), this vast mass
Aof material was classified and named specifically.
                                                     catalogue of the collection

was prepared by Wallich himself (largely aided by Bentham), and sets of the

named specimens were distributed to the leading Botanical institutions in Europe,

every example of each species bearing the same number. No description of the
whole collection was ever attempted, but many of the plants belonging to it were

subsequently described in various places and at various times. So extensive was

the Wallichian distribution that, amongst the names and synonyms of tropical

Asiatic plants, no citation is more frequent in Botanical books than that of

the contraction ' Wall. Cat.' Besides the naming and distribution of this gigantic

collection, Wallich prepared and published, at the expense of the same liberal

and enlightened East India Company, his ' Plantse Asiaticre Rariores,' in three

folio volumes with 300 coloured plates. He also contributed to an edition of

Roxburgh's 'Flora Indica,' which was begun by the celebrated Dr. Carey of

Serampore, descriptions of many plants of his own collecting. But the task of

publishing his discoveries in this way proved beyond his powers, as it would have

proved beyond those of any one who had only 365 days to his year, and less than a

hundred years as his term of life ! Carey and Wallich's edition of Roxburgh's

' Flora Indica' was brought to an untimely conclusion at the end of the Pentan-

dria Monogynia of Linnaeus. Wallich also began an illustrated account of the

Flora of Nepal under the title ' Tentamen Florae Nepalensis.' But this also came

to a premature end with the publication of its second part.

During much of the time that W^allich was labouring in Northern India, Robert

Wight, a botanist of remarkable sagacity and of boundless energy, was labouring

in Southern India, chiefly in parts of the Peninsula different from those in which

Koenig and his band had worked. Wight was never liberally supported by the
Government of Madras, and it was mostly by his own efi'orts and from his own

resources that his collections were made, and that his Botanical works were pub-

lished. The chief of the latter is his * Icones Plantarum.' This book consists of
Afigures with descriptions of more than two thousand Indian species.
                                                                      good

many of the plates are indeed copies from the suite of drawings already referred to

as having been made at Calcutta by Dr. Roxburgh. The rest are from drawings

made by native artists under his personal supervision. Ample evidence of the

extraordinary energy of Dr. Wight is afl'orded by the facts that, although

he had to teach the native artists whom he employed both to draw and

to lithograph, the two thousand Iconcs which he published and described were

issued duriug- the short period of thirteen years, and that during the whole

of this time he performed his official duties.

     Besides this mar/num ojnis Wight published his Spicilegium Nilghirense in

two vols, quarto, with 200 coloured plates. And between 1840 and 1850 he

issued in two vols, quarto, with 200 plates, another book named ' Illustrations of

Indian Botany,' the object of which was to give figures and fuller descriptions of

some of the chief species described in a systematic book of the highest Botanical
merit, which he prepared conjointly with Dr. G. A. Walker-Arnot, Professor of

Botany in the University of Glasgow, and which was published under the title

' Prodromus Floras Peniusulae Indicse.' The ' Prodromus ' was the first attempt

at a Flora of any part of India in which the natural system of classification was
followed. Owing to various causes, this work was never completed, and this

splendid fragment of a Flora of Peninsular India ends with the natural order

J)ipsace(e.

    The next great Indian botanist whose labours demand our attention is
William Grifiith. Born in 1810, sixteen years after Wight, and twenty-four years

later than Wallich, Griffith died before eithei-. But the labours even of such

devotees to science as were these two are quite eclipsed by those of this most

remarkable man. Griffith's Botanical career in India was begun in Tenasserim.
From thence he made Botanical expeditions to the Assam valley, exploring the
Mishmi, Khasia, and Naga ranges. From the latter he passed by a route never
since traversed by a Botanist, through the Hookung valley down the Irrawadi to
Bangoon. Having been appointed, soon after his arrival in Rangoon, surgeon to
Pemberton's Embassy to Bhotan, he explored part of that country, and also sent
collectors into the neighbouring one of Sikkim. At the conclusion of this explora-

tion he was transferred to the opposite extremity of the Northern frontier, and was

posted to the Army of the Indus. After the subjugation of Cabul, he penetrated to

Khorassau. Subsequently he visited the portion of the Himalaya of which Simla is

now the best-known spot. He then made a run down the Nerbudda valley in Central

India, and finally appeared in Malacca as Civil Surgeon of that Settlement. At

the latter place he soon died of an abscess of the liver brought on by the hardships
he had undergone on his various travels, which were made under conditions most

inimical to health, in countries then absolutely unvisited by Europeans. No

Botanist ever made such extensive explorations, nor himself collected so many-

species (9,000), as Griffith did duriug the brief thirteen years of his Indian career

none ever made so many field notes or wrote so many descriptions of plants from
living specimens. His Botanical predecessors and contemporaries were men of
ability and of devotion. Griffith was a man of genius. He did not confine him-

self to the study of flowering plants, nor to the study of them from the point of

view of their place in any system of classification. He also studied their morpho-

logy. The ditlicult problems in the latter naturally had most attraction for him,
and we find liim publishing, in the ' Linnsean Transactions,' the results of his

researches on the ovule in Santalum, Loi-anthw;, Tiscum, and Ci/cas. Griffith

was also a cryptogamist. He collected, studied, and wrote much on Mosses,

Liverworts, Marsiliacea;, and Lycopods, and he made hundreds of drawings to

illustrate his microscopic observations. Wherever he travelled he made sketches of
the most striking features in the scenery. His habit of making notes was invete-

rate                       and his itinerary diaries are full of information not only on the Botany, but
                        ;

also on the zoology, physical geography, geology, meteorology, archaeology, and

agriculture of the countries through which he passed. His manuscripts and

drawings, although left in rather a chaotic state, were published after his death
under the editorship of Dr. McClelland, at the expense of the enlightened and

ever-liberal East India Company. They occupy six volumes in octavo, four in
quarto, and one (a ' Monograph of Palms ') in folio.

    Another Botanist of much fame, who died prematurely in 1822, after an Indian
career of only nine years, was Dr. William Jack. In 1814-15 Jack accompanied
Ochterlony's army to the Nepal terai. He was transferred in 1818 to the Company's

Settlement in Sumatra under Sir Stamford Baffles, and during the four years of

his residence in Sumatra he contributed to Botanical literature descriptions of
                                                                                       ;

                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  909

many new genera and species which were puhlished in his ' Malayan Miscellanies.'
His collections, unfortunately, were for the most part lost by an accident, but those

which were saved are now in the Herbarium Uelessert in Geneva.
     Somewhat similar to Griffith in temperament and versatility was^ the brilliant

Victor Ja

History

this period Jacquemont  ,,,,  ^,

the North- West Himalaya at Mussourie, explored Gharwal and Sirmur, ascended
the Sutlej to Kanawer and Piti (at that time unexplored), visited Casbmir, and
returning to the plains, crossed Northern Rajputana to Malwa and tlie Deccan.
He finally reached Bombay with the intention of returning to France. But at
Bombay he euccumbed to disease of the liver, brought on by hard work and

exposure. His remains, after having lain in the cemetery there for fifty years,
were, with that tender regard for the personality of her famous sons which

France has always shown, exhumed in 1881, and conveyed in a French frigate to

find a permanent resting-place in the place of Jacquemont's birth. Jacquemont's

collections were transmitted to Paris, and his plants were described by

Cambessedes and Decaisne, while his non-botanical collections were elaborated

by workers in the branches of science to which they respectively appertained, the
whole being published in four volumes quarto, at the expense of the French

Government.

    The roll of eminent Botanists who worked in India during the first halt of the
century closes with the name of Thomas Thomson, who collected plants extensively

between 1842 and 1847 in Rohilkund and the Punjab, and again still more exten-
sively during a Government mission to the North-West Himalaya and Tibet
which was continued from 1847 to 1849. During this period Dr. Thomson
explored Simla, Kanawar, Piti, Casbmir, Ladak, and part of the Karakoram.
His collections, which were large and important, were transmitted to the Botanic
Garden at Calcutta, and thence in part to Kew. They formed no insignificant
part of the materials on which the ' Flora Indica ' and ' Flora of British India ' were
founded. Dr. Thomson also published an account of his travels--an admirable

book, though now jostled out of memory by the quantities of subsequently issued

books of Himalayan travel and adventure.
     About the year 1820 a second centre of Botanical enterprise was established at

Sebarunpore, in the North-West Provinces. A. large old garden near that impor-

tant town, which had been originally founded by some Mohammedan nobles of the
Delhi Court, was taken over by the Honourable Company, and was gradually put
upon a scientific basis bv Dr. George Govan, who was appointed its first superinten-
dent. Dr. Govan was in 1823 succeeded by Dr. J. Forbes Royle, and he in 1832 by

Dr. Hugh Falconer. Dr. Royle made collections in the Jumno-Gangetic plain, in the
Lower Gharwal Himalaya, and in Casbmir. He was distinguished in the field of

Economic rather than in that of Systematic Botany, his chief contribution to the
latter bavingbeen a folio volume entitled ' Illustrations of the Botany of the Himalaya

Mountains.' His valuable labours as an Economic Botanist will be noticed later on.

Huo-h Falconer was an accomplished palaeontologist who devoted but little of his

sple^ndid talents to Botany. His great contribution to paL-eontology, the value of
which it is almost impossible to over-estimate, consisted of his exploration and
classification of the tertiary fossils of the SewalUi range. Falconer was transferred

to the Calcutta Garden in 1842. He was succeeded at Sebarunpore by Dr. W.

Jameson, who explored the Botany of Gharwal, Kamaon, and Casbmir, but who

 published nothing Botanical, his chief energies having been devoted to the useful

work of introducing the cultivation of the Cbina tea plant into British India, and

this he did (as will afterwards be mentioned) with triumphant success.

      During the first half of the century, a considerable amount of excellent Botanic
 work was done in Western India by Graham, Law, Nimmo, Gibson, Stocks, and
Dalzell, the results of whose labours culminated in the preparation by Graham of

 a List of the Plants of Bombay, which was not, however, published until 1 839 (after
 his death) ; in the publication by Stocks of various papers on the Botany of Scinde
 and in the publication by Dalzell and Gibson in 1861 of his ' Flora of Bombay,' It is

impossible in a brief review like the present to mention the names of all the workers

who, in various parts of the gradually extending Indian Empire, added to our know-

ledge of its Botanical wealth. It must suffice to mention the names of a few of

the chief, such as Hardwicke, Madden, Munro, Edgeworth, Lance, and Vicary,

who collected and observed in Northern India, and who all, except the two

last mentioned, also published Botanical papers and pamphlets of more or less

importance ; Jenkins, Masters, Mack, Simons, and Oldham, who all collected exten-
sively in Assam ; Hofmeister, who accompanied Prince Waldemar of Prussia, and
whose collections form the basis of the fine work by Klotzsch and Garcke (Jteis. Pr.

Wald.) ; Norris, Prince, Lobb, and Cuming, whose labours were in Penang
and Malacca; and last, but not least, Strachey and Winterbottom, whose large

and valuable collections, amounting to about 2,000 species, were made during 1848
to 1850 in the higher ranges of the Kamaon and Gharwal Himalaya, and in the

adjacent parts of Tibet. In referring to the latter classic Herbarium, Sir Joseph

Iloolier remarks that it is ' the most valuable for its size that has ever been distri-

buted from India.' General Strachey is the only one who survives of the splendid
band of collectors whom I have mentioned, 1 cannot conclude this brief account of

the Botnnical labours of our first period without mentioning one more book, and

that is the * Hortus Calcuttensis ' of Voigt. Undar the form of a list, this excellent

work, published in 1845, contains a great deal of information about the plants

growing near Calcutta, either wild or in fields and gardens. It is strong in

vernacular names and vegetable economics.

The second period of our history begins with tbe arrival in India in 1848 of

Sir (then Dr.) Joseph Hooker. This distinguished Botanist came out in the suite

of Lord Dalhousie, who h.ad been appointed Governor-General of India. The

province to the exploration of which Sir Joseph directed his chief attention was

that of Sikkim in the Eastern Himalaya, the higher and inner ranges of which had

never previously been visited by a Botanist, for Griffith's explorations had been

confined to the lower and outer spurs. The results of Sir Joseph's labours in

Sikkim were enormous. Towards the end of his exploration of Sikkim he was

joined by Dr. Thomas Thomson, and the two friends subsequently explored the

Khasia Hills (one of the richest collecting grounds in the world), and also to some

extent the districts of Sylhet, Cachar, and Chittagong. Dr. Thomson subsequently

amalgamated the collections made by himself in the Western Himalaya with those

made in Sikkim by Sir Joseph individually, and by them both conjointly in Eastern

India ; and a distribution of the duplicates after the fashion of the Wallichiaa issue,
and second only to it in importance, was subsequently made from Kew. The number

of species thus issued amounted to from 6,000 to 7,000, and the individuals were

much more numerous than those of the Wallichian collection. The immediate literary

results of Sir Joseph Hooker's visit to Sikkim were, (1) his superbly illustrated

monograph of the new and magnificent species of Rhododendron which he had

discovered                                                    (2)  a similar splendid volume illustrated by plates founded on drawings
                                                           ;

of certain other prominent plants of the Eastern Himalaya which had been made

--for Mr. Oathcart, a member of the Civil Service of India, and (3) his classic

' Himalayan Journals ' a book which remains until this day the richest repertory

of information concerning the botany, geography, and anthropology of the Eastern

AHimalaya.                                                         remoter result was the appearance in 1855 of the first volume of a

'Flora Indica,' projected by himself and his friend Dr. Thomson. The first half of

this volume is occupied by a masterly introductory essay on Indian Botany, of

which it is hardly possible to overrate the importance. This remarkable essay

contains by far the most important contribution to the Physico- Geographical

Botany of India that has ever been made, and it .abounds in sagacious observations

on the limitation of species and on hybridisation, besides containing much informa-

tion on the history of Indian Botanical collections and collectors. The taxonomic

part of the book was cast in a large mould, and the descriptions were written in

Latin. Unfortunately the condition of Dr. Thomson's health and the pressure of

KewSir Joseph's official duties at                                 made it impossible that the book should be

continued on the magnificent scale on which it had been conceived. After a period

of about twelve years Sir Joseph, however, returned to the task of preparing, with
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  911

the aid of other Botanists, a Flora of the Indian Empire, conceived on a smaller
scale and written in the English language. His proposals for this work were

accepted and officially sanctioned by the Duke of Argyll while he was Secretary
of State for India. The first part of this great work was published iu 187:^ and
the last in 1897. In the execution of this great undertaking Sir Joseph had the
assistance of Mr. C. B. Clarke, who elaborated various natural orders ; of Mr. J. G.
Baker, who worked out Leguminoscc and Scitamwece, and of Sir W. Thiselton Dyer,
Messrs. A. W. Bennett, Anderson, Edgewortb, Iliern, La.wson, Maxwell Masters,
Stapf, and Gamble. The greater proportion, however, of the book is Sir Joseph's
own work, and a noble monument it forms of his devotion and genius.

      Since the date of Sir Joseph Hooker's visit to India, by far the most important

Botanical work done in India has been that of Mr. C. B. Clarke. Rather than

attempt to give any appreciation of my own of Mr. Clarke's labours (which
would be more or less of an impertinence), I may be allowed to quote from the

preface to the concluding volume of the ' Flora of British India,' Sir Joseph

KewHooker's estimate of them. Referring to all the collections received at

since the preparation of the ' Flora ' was begun, Sir Joseph writes : ' The first in

importance amongst them are Mr. C. B. Clarke's, whether for their extent, the

knowledge and judgment with which the specimens were selected, ticketed, and

preserved, and for the valuable observations which accompany them.' Mr. Clarke

has published numerous papers on Indian Botanical subjects in the Journals of the

Linnsean and other societies. He has issued as independent books monographs of

Indian Composite and Ci/i'tandraceo', the former in octavo, the latter in folio, and

illustrated by many plates; and he is now engaged on his op2{S 7na.iim2(m, \iz. a
monograph of the Ci/perace(B, not only of India, but of the whole world ; and to

the completion and publication of this every systematic Botanist is looking forward

with eager anxiety.

     During this second half of the century Dr. Thomas Anderson, who was for ten
years superintendent of the Calcutta Garden, collected much; and he had just
entered on what promised to be a brilliant career of Botanical authorship when his
life was cut short by disease of the liver, contracted during his labours to establish

the cultivation in British India of the quinine-yielding species of cinchona.

Dr. Ander,«on was also the earliest Conservator of Forests in Bengal. Sulpiz
Kurz, for many years Curator of the Calcutta Herbarium, also collected largely in
Burma, and besides many excellent papers which he contributed to the 'Journal

of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,' he prepared for Government an excellent
manual entitled ' The Forest Flora of Burma.' This was published in two volumes
in 1877. Other collectors in Burma were Colonel Eyre (in Pegu), Mr. Burness

(at Ava), and the Rev. Mr. Parish, to whom horticulturists are indebted for

the introduction to Europe of the beautiful orchids of this rich province.

And in this connection must be mentioned Mr. E. H. Man, CLE., who,
although not himself a Botanist, has given for many years past the greatest
possible help in the Botanical exploration of the Andaman and Nicobar groups

of islands, our first knowledge of which was, by the way, derived from the
collections made by the naturalists of the Austrian and Danish exploring expedi-

tions. A large book on Burma, which contains a good deal of Botany, was
published by an American missionary named Mason, who resided for the greater
part of his working life in that country. General Sir Henry Collett, who com-
 manded a brigade during the last Burmese war, also made most interesting collec-

 tions iu that country, the novelties of which were described by himself in

collaboration with Mr. AV. Botting Hemsley, of the Kew Herbarium, iu the

 Linnasau Society's ' Journal' some years ago. Sir Henry Collett also collected
much in the Khasia and Naga hills, and in the portion of the North-Western
 Himalaya of which Simla is the capital, and on these latter collections, together

with the materials in Kew Herbarium, Sir Henry is now elaborating a local

 Flora of Simla. The preparation of a local Flora for an Indian district is
an entirely now departure, and the publication of Sir Henry's book, Avhich is

 to be well illustrated, is looked forward to with much interest. At rather
 an earlier period. Dr. Aitchieson, CLE., was a diligent collector of the plants of the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                '

PuDJalj and of the Nortli- Western Frontier. Some results of his work are to be
found in his ' List of Punjab Plants/ which was published in 1867, and in various
papers -which he contributed (some of them in conjunction with Mr. Hemsley) to

the Linnaaan Society and to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh. In Dr. G.
Henderson's book on Yarkand there are also descriptions of some plants of the
extreme North-Western Himalaya and of Western Tibet. Mr. (now Sir George)

Birdwood also made some contributions to the Botany of the Bombay Presidency.

      Five officers of the Indian Forest Department, viz. Dr. Lindsay Stewart, Colonel

Beddome, Sir D. Brandis, and Messrs. Talbot and Gamble, CLE., have within the
past thirty years made important contributions to the Systematic Botany of India.

Dr. Stewart collected largely, and published in 18G9 his ' Punjab Plants,' a book
which gives a very imperfect impression of his acquirements as a Botanist. Sir
Dietrich Brandis issued in 1874 his admirably accurate ' Forest Flora of the

North-West Provinces of India,' illustrated by seventy excellent plates. Between
the years 1869 and 1873, Colonel Beddome issued his 'Flora Sylvatica of the

Madras Presidency,' illustrated by numerous plates. He also published, between

1869 and 1874, a volume of descriptions and figures of new Indian plants, under
the title ' Icones Plantarum India3 Orientalis.' Colonel Beddome is the only Indian
Botanist of note, except Griffith, Mi'. C. B. Clarke, and Mr. C. W. Hope, who has
written much on Indian Ferns. His two works, the ' Ferns of Southern India
and the ' Ferns of British India,' published, the former in 1863 and the latter

between 1805 and 1870, practically give a systematic account, together with
excellent figures, of the whole Fern Flora of India. Of these excellent books a
condensation in a popular and abridged form has also been issued. The fourth

Forest officer who has published contributions to Systematic Botany is Mr. W. A.
Talbot, whose ' List of the Trees, Shrubs, and Woody Climbers of the Bombay
Presidency ' gives evidence of much careful research. And the fifth is Mr. J. S.
Gamble, who, besides amassing at his own expense probably the largest private

collection of plants ever owned in India, has published a systematic account of the
Indian Bumbusece, a tribe of grasses which, from the peculiarity of many of the
species in the matter of flowering, had so long been the bane of the Indian agros-
tologist. Mr. Gamble, in his monograph, gives a description and a life-sized figure
of every one of the Indian species. Of this monograph (which forms a volume of
the ' Annals of the Botanic Garden, Calcutta ') Sir Joseph Hooker writes (at

p. 375. vol. vii. of his 'Flora of British India'): ' It is indispensable to the student
of the tribe by reason of its descriptions and admirable plates and analyses.' Mi-.

AGamble has also published a Manual of Indian Timbers. Forest officer who was

ever ready to help in Botanical work, but who never himself published, was Mr.
Gustav Mann, for many years Conservator of Forests in Assam, but now lost to
India by his premature retirement. Other Forest officers, who have done, and are
still doing, good botanical work in their various spheres, are Messrs. Lace, lleinig,
Haines, McDonell, Ellis, Oliver, and Upendra Nath Kanjilal. Mr. Bourdillon,

Conservator of Forests in the Travancore State, is also an enthusiastic Botanist and

collector.

    In the Madras Presidency Botanical work has been carried on durbig this second
half of the century by Noton, Perrottet, Metz, Ilohenacher, Schmidt (on the Nil-

giris), Bidie, and Lawson. By the efforts of the latter two a second public
Herbarium was established in Madras (the first having been broken up many years
ago), and in this second Madras Herbarium are to be found many of the collections

of Wight, besides those of the other Madras Botanists just named.

    In the Bombay Presidency the only public Herbarium is at Poona. This is

of recent origin, and owes its e.xistence to the devotion of four men, viz. Dr.
Theodore Cooke (late Principal of the College of Science at Poona), Mr. Marshall

Woodrow (until recently Superintendent of the Garden at Guneshkind and

Lecturer in Botany in the Poona College), the late Mr. Ranade (a native gentle-

--man), and Dr. Lisboa (a medical practitioner in the Deccan) all four enthusiastic

Botanists. The amount of Government support given to the Herbarium at Poona
has hitherto been very inadequate. It is to be hoped that greater liberality

may be extended to it now that a stranger to the Bombay Presidency has just
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.      913

teen appointed to its charge in the person of Mr.. George Gammie, hitherto
employed in the Cinchona Department of Bengal.

     Reference has already been made to the Botanic Gardens at Seharuupore and
Calcutta. But to complete this sketch, and especially in order to give a clear idea
of the apparatus at present existing in India for carrying on the study and prac-
tice of Systematic Botany, it is necessary again to refer to them. On the retire-
ment of Dr. Jameson in 1872, Mr. .7. F. Duthie was selected by the Secretary of

State for India as Superintendent of the Seharunpore Garden. Mr. Duthie is still
at Seharunpore. During his tenure of office he has added to the Herbarium
previously existing there (which consisted chiefly of the collections of Royle,
Falconer, and Jameson) a magnificent collection of his own. Mr. Duthie has
pubUshed a valuable book on the ' Field and Garden Crops of the North-Western

Provinces,' and another on the Grasses of the same area. He is now engaged on

the preparation of local Floras of the North-West Provinces and of the Punjab.
     The Calcutta Garden at the date of Sir J. D. Hooker's arrival in India in 1848

was under the temporary charge of Dr. McClelland, who soon made way for Dr.

Falconer, who, in 1855, was succeeded by Dr. J. Thomson, and he in turn by Dr. T.
Anderson in 180 1 . Mr. C. B. Clarke acted as Superintendent during the interregnum

between Dr. Anderson's lamented death in 1870 and my own appointment in 1871.

The Garden and Herbarium at Calcutta have been most liberally supported by the
Government of Bengal. By funds thus supplied the Garden has been remodelled and
improved ; the Herbarium has been housed in on excellent fire-proof building (erected
in 1883), and the collections of which it consists have been greatly increased. The
chief items of these later acquisitions have been the large contributions of Mr. C. B.
Clarke ; of Dr. D. Prain, for many years Curator of the Herbarium, and now Superin-
tendent of the Garden and of the cinchona plantation and factory ; of Mr. G. A.
Gammie, formerly one of the staff" of the cinchona plantation, and now Lecturer on
Botany in the College of Science at Poona ; of Mr. E. Pantling, Deputy- Superin-
tendent of the Cinchona plantation, who, in addition to dried specimens of the orchids

of Sikkim, contributed nearly five hundred drawings, most of which h,s,ve been litho-
graphed as the illustrations to a book published in the ' Annals ' of the Garden, as the

' Orchid Flora of Sikkim ; ' of Mr. Kunstler, a collector in the Malay Peninsula ; and
last, but by no means least, of a trained band of aborigines of Sikkim named Lepchas

who possess keener powers of observation of natural objects, more patience, sweeter
tempers, and, I am bound in fairness to add, dirtier clothes than any race I have ever

--met black, yellow, or white ! In addition to their liberal grants to the Garden and

Herbarium, the Bengal Government, twelve years ago, sanctioned the publication,

at their expense, as occasion might offer, of monographs of important families or
genera of Indian plants. These monographs are printed in quarto, and they are,
witb one exception, profusely illustrated by plates drawn and lithographed by

Bengali draughtsmen. The series is known as ' The Annals of the Royal Botanic
Garden, Calcutta,' and it has now reached its eighth volume, the ninth being in
active preparation. These 'Annals' have been contributed to by Dr. Prain (my
successor at the Calcutta Garden), by Dr. D. Douglas Cunningham, Mr. J. S.

Gamble, Mr. R. Pantling, and myself.
     About ten years ago, it occurred to the Supreme Government of India that it

might be to the interest of Science if the four Botanical establishments at Calcutta,
Seharunpore, Madras, and Poona were to be formed into a kind of hierarchy under
the designation of The Botanical Survey of India, without removing either
the officers or the four institutions to which they were attached from the
financial or general control of the local administrations within which they are
respectively situated, the Supreme Government making a small contribution of
money for the purpose of exploring little-known districts and making itself

responsible for the cost of a publication called ' The Records of the Botanical
Survey.' The four institutions just mentioned continue, therefore, to be paid for
and controlled by the Governments of Bengal, the North- West Provinces, Madras,
and Bombay, but their Superintendents are placed on the cadre of the Botanical
 Survey. The published Records of this Survey now extend to twelve numbers,
 each of which is devoted to an account of the Botany of some part of the enormous
 and continually expanding area to be explored.

Sucli, tlien, is tlie machinery by which Systematic and Geographical, as distin-

guished from Economic and Physiological, Botany is carried on within the Indian
Empire. But the work done in India itself by no means represents all that is

being carried on in connection with the elucidation of the Flora of the Empire

of India. On the contrary the bulk of the work of elaborating the materials

sent from India in the shape of dried specimens has always been, and must

always  be,  done  in  a  large  Herbarium                                                         and  until  lately no  Herbarium  in  Asia

Aquestion must still lie in Europe.
                                                                                                   very large number of the Herbarium

specimens collected in India have found their way to the various centres of

Botanical activity in Europe, and have been described by Botanists of many

nationalities. The lion's share of these specimens has naturally come to the two

great national Herbaria in the British Museum and at Kew, but especially to the
latter. It was in the Kew Herbarium that Sir Joseph Hooker and his collaborateurs

prepared the Flora of British India. And it is in the Kew Herbarium that are

to be found the types of an overwhelming proportion of the new species described

for the first time in that monumental work. The Kew Herbarium is therefore to

the Indian Botanist the most important that exists. I must apologise for diverging

for a moment to remind you what a type specimen is. It is the very one on which

an author has founded any species to which he has given a name. And in order

to determine absolutely what is the specific form to which the author meant his

name to apply, it is often necessary to examine his type. This necessity increases

in urgency with the extension of our knowledge of tlie Flora of the world.

The preservation in good condition of a type specimen is therefore, from the

point of view of a Systematic Botanist, as important as is the preservation to the

British merchant of the standard pound weight and the standard yard measure on

which the operations of British commerce depend. ' Types ' also stand to the

Systematic Botanist much in the same relation as the national records do to the

national historian. The latter are guarded in the Record Office, I understand,

with all the skill which the makers of fire-proof, damp-proof, and burglar-proof

depositories can suggest. If, however, the type of a species happens to be

deposited at Kew, what are the probabilities of its preservation ? Such a type at

Kew is incorporated in what is admitted to be in every sense the largest and, for

its size, the most accurately named, the most easily consulted, and therefore the

most valuable Herbarium in the world, the destruction of which would be a

calamity commensurate in extent with that of the burning of the Library at

Alexandria. One might therefore reasonably expect that a people who rather

resent being called a 'nation of shopkeepers' would feel pride in providing for

this priceless national collection a hame which, although perhaps somewhat

inferior to that provided for the National Historical Records, might at least be

Kewsafe from fire. This expectation is not fulfilled. The infinitely valuable

Herbarium and library have no safer home than an old dwelling-house on Kew

Green, to which a cheap additional wing has been built. The floor, galleries, and

open inner roof of this additional wing are constructed of pine coated with an

inflammable varnish, and on the floor and galleries are arranged cabinets (also made

of pine-wood), in which the specimens (which are mounted on paper) are lodged.

The provision of a fireproof building, capable of expansion as the collections extend,

is surely not beyond the means of an exchequer which last year netted over one

hundred and six milhons sterling of revenue. On behalf of the Flora of India, I

venture to express the hope that the provision of a proper home for its types may

receive early and favourable consideration by the holders of the national purse-

strings. But India is by no means the only portion of the Empire interested in

this matter, for the types of the Australasian Floras, those of a large part of the

North American Flora, and those of many species inhabiting countries outside British

Kewrule or influence, find their resting-place at Kew. The safe custody of the

Herbarium is, therefore, not merely a national, but a cosmopolitan responsibility.

In this Address I have hitherto made little reference to Cryptogamic and

Economic Botany. As regards Cryptogamic Botany there is little to relate.

I have divided my sketch ever did any serious work amongst non-vascular Crypto-

gams. During the second period two men have done gallant work under difhculties
which no one who has not lived in a tropical country can thoroughly appreciate. L
refer to Drs. Arthur Barclay and D. D. Cunniugham. The former made some
progress in the study of Uredinous fungi, which was cut short by his untimely

death, while the latter, in addition to his bacterial and other researches con-

nected with the causation of human disease, conducted protracted investigations

into some diseases of plants of fungal or algal origin. Some of the results of Dr.

Cunningham's labours were published in the 'Transactions' of the Linnean

Society, and in a series entitled the ' Scientific Memoirs, by Medical Officers of the
Indian Army.' To the ' Annals of the Botanic Garden, Calcutta,' Dr. Cunningham
also contributed elaborate memoirs on the phenomena of Nyctitropism, and on the
mode of fertilisation in an Indian species of Ficus {F. lioxhurr/hii). There is no
<loubt that in the past Cryptogamic Botany has not been studied in India as it ought
to have been and might have been. This discredit will, I hope, be soon removed

and I trust that, by the time the twentieth century opens, a Cryptogamist may

have been appointed to the staff of the Calcutta Botanic Garden. The collecting
of Cryptogams was not, however, altogether neglected in India in times past. For,
from materials sent to England, Mitten was able to elaborate a Moss Flora of India,
while Berkeley and Browne were enabled to prepare their account of the Fungi of

Ceylon. Dr. George Wallich, in whom the Botanical genius of his father burnt with

a clear though flickering flame, did some excellent work amongst Desmids, and was
among the earliest of deep-sea dredgers.

     Economic Botany has, on the other hand, by no means been neglected. It was
chiefly on economic grounds that the establishment of a Botanic Garden at Calcutta

was pressed upon the Court of Directors of the East India Company. And almost

every one of the workers whose labours I have alluded to has incidentally devoted
some attention to the economic aspect of Botany. Roxburgh's ' Flora Indica
contains all that was known up to his day of the uses of the plants described in

it. Much of Wight's time was spent in improving the races of cotton grown in
India. The Botanists of the Seharunpore Garden during the middle of the

century were especially prominent in this branch of Botanical activity. Boyle
wrote largely on cotton and on other fibres, on drugs, and on various vegetable

products used, or likely to be of use, in the arts. These Botanists introduced into

the Himalayas more than fifty years ago the best European fruits. From gardens
which owe their origin to Royle, Falconer, and Jameson, excellent apples grown
in Gharwal and Kamaon are to-day purchasable in Calcutta. Peaches, nectarines,

grapes, strawberries, of European origin, are plentiful and cheap all over the North-

West Himalaya, and are obtainable also in the submontane districts. Potatoes,
and all the best European vegetables, were introduced long ago ; and at Seharun-
pore there is still kept up a large vegetable garden from which seeds of most

European vegetables are issued for cultivation during the cold season in the
gardens of the various regiments of the Queen's troops quartered in Upper India.
More or less attention has been given in the past by Government Botanists in
India generally to the improvement of the cultivation of flax, hemp, rheea, tobacco,
henbane, dandelion, vanilla, sarsaparilla, coffee (Arabian and Liberian), cocoa,
ipecacuanha, aloes, jalap, indiarubber, Japanese paper-mulberry, cardamoms,
tapioca, coca, tea, and cinchona. Only to three economic enterprises, however,
have I time to allude in any detail. These are (1) the cultivation of tea, {'2) the
introduction of cinchona, and (3) the formation of the Forest Department. But
before proceeding to the consideration of these I wish to give a short account of the

inauguration of the office of Reporter on Economic Products. Up to the year 1883

there had been no special Government department in India for dealing with ques-
tions connected with the natural products of the Empire. Whatever had been
done prior to that date (and the amount was by no means unimportant) was the
result of isolated and uncoordinated efibrt. In 1883 the Government of India
founded a department for dealing with the Economic Products of the Indian
Empire, and under the title of Reporter on these products they were fortunate
enough to secure Dr. George AVatt, a member of the Bengal Educational Service.

916 REPORT-- 1899.

Dr. Watt is an accomplished and able Botanist. He bas collected Indian plants

largely, and bas made numerous notes both in the field and in the bazaar. The
great work which, on the initiative of Sir Edward Buck, Secretary to the Depart-

ment of Revenue and Agriculture, and of Sir W. Thiselton Dyer, of Kew,

Dr. Watt began and carried to a successful termination was the compilation of
his ' Dictionary of Economic Products,' in which valuable book is collected all that
is known of almost every Indian product, whether vegetable, animal, or mineral.
The study of Economic Botany is now pursued in India as part of a highly
specialised system of inquiry and experiment. Dr. Watt has a competent staff

under him in Calcutta, one of whom is Mr. D. Hooper, well known for his

original researches into the properties of various Indian drugs. Dr. Watt has
arranged in Calcutta a magnificent museum of economic products, and there is no-
doubt the economic resources of the Empire are now being studied with as much

energy as intelligence.
     Tea cultivation is one of the enterprises in the introduction and development

of which Botanists took a very leading part. The advisability of introducing the
industry was first pressed on the attention of the East India Company by Dr.
Govan (of Seharunpore), and in this he was seconded by Sir Joseph Banks as Pre-
sident of the Royal Society. Royle in 1827, and Falconer slightly later, again
urged it as regards the North-AVest Himalaya. In 1826 David Scott demon-
strated to rather imwilling eyes in Calcutta the fact that real tea grows wild
in Assam. In 1835 Wallich, Griffith, and McClelland were deputed by Govern-
ment to visit Assam, to report on the indigenous tea. In the year 1838 the
fii'st consignment of Indian-grown tea was offered for sale in London. The
consignment consisted of twelve chests containing 20 lbs. each. This first sample-
of 240 lbs. was favourably reported upon. Last year the exports of tea from

India to all countries reached 157 millions of pounds, besides 120 millions of pounds-

exported from Ceylon
     The introduction of cinchona into India originated purely with the Govern-

ment Botanists. As everybody knows, quinine, and to a less extent the other

alkaloids present in cinchona bark, are practically the only remedies for the
commonest, and in some of its forms one of the most fatal, of all Indian diseases,,
viz. vialariovs fever. The sources of supply of the cinchona barks in their native

countries in South America were known to be gradually failing, and the price of
quinine had for long been increasing. The advisability of growing cinchona in the
mountains of British India was therefore pressed upon Government by Dr. Royle
in 1835, and he repeated Ins suo-gestions in 1847, 1853, and 1856. Dr. Falconer, in
his capacity of Superintendent of the Botanic Garden, Calcutta, made a similar
suggestion in 1852; and his successors at Calcutta, Dr. T. Thomson and Dr. T.
Anderson, in turn advocated the proposal. In 1858 Government at last took action,,

and, as the result of the labours of Sir Clements Markham and Sir W. J. Hooker, of

--Kew, the medicinal cinchonas were finally, in the period between 1861 and 1865,

successfully introduced into British India on the Nilgiris under Mr. Mclvor, and
on the Sikkim-Himalaya under Dr. T. Anderson. Various experiments on the best
mode of utilising the alkaloids contained in red cinchona bark resulted in the
production in 1870 by Mr. Broughton, Quinologist on the Nilgiri plantation, of an
amorphous preparation containing all the alkaloids of that bark. This preparation
was named ^Hiorjo/io?M Quinine. Somewhat later (1875) a similar preparation,
under the name of Cinchona Febrifuge, was produced at the Sikkim plantation by
Mr. 0. H. Wood, the Quinologist there ; and of these drugs about fifty-one tons
had been distributed from the Sikkim plantation up to the end of last year. The
preparation of pure quinine from the yellow cinchona barks, so successfully grown
in the Sikkim plantation, long remained a serious problem. The manufacture of

quinine had hitherto been practically a trade secret. And when the Indian Govern-

ment had succeeded in providing the raw material from which a cheap quinine
might be made for distribution amongst its fever-stricken subjects, the knowledge
of the means of extracting this quinine was wanting. Philanthropic platitudes
were freely bandied about as to the immensity of the boon which cheap quinine
would be to a fever-stricken population numbering so many millions. But there

·was a singular absence of any practical help in the shape of proposals, or even

hints, as to how quinine was to be extracted from the rapidly increasing stock of
crown and yellow bark. The otticers in charge of the cinchona plantations in India
had therefore to do their best to solve the problem for themselves. And it was ulti-
mately solved by Mr. C. H. Wood, at onetime Government QuinologistinSikkim,
who suggested, and Mr. J. A. Gammie, Deputy-Superintendent of the plantation
there, who carried into practice a method of extraction by the use, as solvents of
the cinchona alkaloids, of a mixture of fusel-oil and petroleum. The details of

this process were published in the ' Calcutta Ofllcial Gazette,' for the tenefit of all

whom it might concern. Ver\' soon after the introduction of this method of

manufacture j'^the Government factories in Sikkim and the Nilgiris were able to
supply tlie whole of the Government hospitals and dispensaries in India with all
the quinine required in them (some 5,000 or 6,000 pounds annually), besides
providing an almost equal quantity for the supply of Government ofHcers for

charitabfe purposes. The latest development of the quiniae enterprise in India
has been the organisation of a scheme for the sale at all the post-offices in the

province of Bengal, and in some of those of Madras, of packets each containing

live grains of pure quinine, that being a sufficient dose for an ordinary case of fever
in a native of India. These packets (of which some are on the_ table for distri-
bution) are sold at one pice each, the pice being a coin which is equal, at the

current rate of exchange, to one farthing sterling !

In conclusion, I wish to make a few remarks on the third great economic

enterprise  connected   with  Botany  in  India,  viz.  the  Forest  Department.                                                               The
                                                                                                                                            _

necessity for taking some steps "to preserve a continuity of supply of timber,

bamboos, and other products from the jungles which had for generations been

exploited in the most reckless fashion, was first recognised by the Government of

Bombay, who in 1807 appointed commissioners to fix the boundaries of and to

guard the forests in that Presidency. This scheme was abandoned in 1822, but

was resumed in a modified form during 1839-40. Seven years later a regular

forest service was established in Bombay, and Dr. Gibson was its first head. Dr.

--Gibson in turn was succeeded by Mr. Dalzell and both were Botanists. In the

Madras I'residency the first man to recognise the necessity of perpetuating the

isupply of teak for ship-building was Mr. Connolly, collector of Malabar, who in

1843 established a teak plantation at Nelumbur, which has been carried on, and

annually added to, down to the present time. In 1847 Dr. Cleghorn (a Botanist)

was appointed to report on the conservation of the forests of Mysore (which con-

tain the well-known sandal-wood), and the following year Lieutenant Michael

(still with us as General Michael, a hale and hearty veteran) was appointed^ to

organise and conserve the public forests in Coimbatore and Cochin. The crowning

merit of General Michael's administration was the establishment, for the first time

in India, of a system of protection against the fires which annually used to work

such deadly havoc. In 1850 the British Association, at their Edinburgh Meeting,

appointed a Committee to consider and report upon the probable eflects, from an

economic and physical point of view, of the destruction of tropical forests. This

Committee's Heport was submitted to the Association at the Meeting at Ipswich in

1851. The weighty evidence collected in this Report so impressed the Court of

Directors of the East India Company that, within a few years, regular forest esta-
blishments were sanctioned for Madras and British Burma, the two main sources

of the supply of teak.

In 1850" 5Ir. (now Sir Dietrich) Brandis was appointed to the care of the

forests of tlie latter province. These forests had been the object of spasmodic

efforts in conservancy for many years previously. In 1827 Dr. Wallich reported

on the teak forests, and five years later a small conservancy establishment was

organised, officered by natives. This, however, was kept up for only three or four

years. In 1837 and 1838 Dr. Heifer reported on these forests, and an English

conservator was appointed. In 1842 and 1847 Codes of Forest Laws were drawn

up, but do not appear to have been enforced to any extent. In 1853 Dr. McClelland

was appointed superintendent, but he continued to hold the office for only a short

A"time.     few years after Sir Dietrich Brandis's assumption of the charge of the
918 EEPORT-- 1899.

Burmese Forests, he was appointed Inspector-General of all the Government

Forests in British India ; and it is to liim that "we owe for the most part the
organisation of the Indian Forest Department as it now exists. That organisation

includes two Schools of Forestry (in both of which Botany is taught), one in con-
nection with Cooper's Hill and the other at DehraDun in Upper India. The latter

has for many years been under the direction of a gentleman who is distin-

guished both as a Forester and as a Botanist. In the Cooper's Hill School, the

higher grades of Forest officers receive their training ; at Dehra Dun those of the

lower grades receive theirs. The officers of the department on the Imperial list,
according to the latest official returns, now number i!08, divided into the grades of

conservator, deputy- and assistant-conservator, with a single inspector-general as

chief. In addition to these, there are 566 provincial officers, ranking from rangers

upwards to extra deputy-conservators.

     Botanists took a leading part in moulding the department in its earlier years ,

--for, as already stated, its pioneers Gibson, Dalzell, Cleghorn, Anderson, Stewart,
--and Brandis were all Botanists. And to most people, who give even casual

attention to the matter, it appears fitting that the possession of a knowledge

and liking for Botany should form a strong characteristic of officers whose main

duties are to be in the forest. And this belief did for some time exercise consider-

able influence in the selection of recruits for the department. But, except in the

Dehra Dun School, it does not appear to guide the department anj^ longer. For

example, at the Fntrance Examination to the Forest School at Cooper's Hill,

only three subjects are obligatory for a candidate, viz. mathematics, to which

3,000 marks are allowed ;  German,     to  which  2,000  are  allowed                                        and  English,
                                                                                                          ;

for which 1,000 are given. Botany is one of the nine optional subjects of which a

candidate may take up two, and in each of which 2,000 marks may be made.

Botany is taught at Cooper's Hill, and (according to the Calendar of the

College) it forms one of the ' special auxiliary subjects ' for the Forest student.

I do not wish to say a single word in depreciation of the Botanical teaching at this

College, which is probably excellent of its sort. I do not know what value, as

part of their professional equipment, students are accustomed or encouraged to

attach to the possession of the means of acquiring a knowledge of the trees and

shrubs in the midst of which they are to pass their lives in India. But this I do

know, that the ordinary Forest officer educated in England now arrives in India

"without sufficient knowledge to enable him to recognise from their Botanical

characters the most well-marked Indian trees. To tell such an officer the name

of the natural family to which a plant belongs conveys no information to

him whatever, for he knows nothing of Botanical affinities. Moreover, the

Forest officer after he has arrived in India is not encouraged to familiarise himself

with the contents of the forests under his charge. This will be better appreciated

by giving an example than by any number of remarks. Some three years

ago, Mr. J. S. Gamble (a Forest officer) published a monograph of the Bamboos

of I3ritish India. From bamboos, as you may possibly be aware, a very large

amount of Forest revenue is annually derived. The sales of bamboos for the

Ayear 1896-97 amounted to no less than 110 millions of stems.  great number of

the species of bamboos have the curious habit of flowering gregariously at remote

intervals of thirty or forty years, and the flowering is followed by death. The absence

from the forests for years in succession of flowers of a number of the species, and the

similarity of many of them in leaves, had hitherto made members of the group most

difficult of identification. Mr. Gamble had devoted himself to their study for many
years. He had carefully examined all the previously collected materials stored in the

Herbaria at Kew, the British Museum, Calcutta, and elsewhere ; and large special
collections had been made for him by Mr. Gustav Mann and other officers of

Government. Moreover, he had General Munro's great paper in the ' Linnean

Transactions ' as a basis. Mr. Gamble's work was undertaken with the full
approval of Sir Joseph Hooker, who indeed accepted Mr. Gamble's account of the

bamboos for his ' Flora of British India.' Mr. Gamble's monograph is illustrated

by a life-sized drawing of each species, with analyses of the flowers on a larger

scale. Wlien comnleted, the book was published as one of the volumes of the
                                                                        --

                                                                  !

' Annals of the Calcutta Botanic Garden.' In consideration of the supposed great
importance of the book to the forester, and in the belief that the copies would be
eagerly taken by the Forest Department, an extra hundred copies were printed,
and these hundred copies were put into stout canvas binding suitable for camp use.

These copies, or as many of them as he cared to take, were ofl'ered to the
Head of the Forest Department in India at the reduced price of fifteen rupees
per copy. The result was an official refusal to buy a single one, although the

--purchase of the whole hundred (which was not asked for) would have cost only

fifteen hundred rupees a sum which would have reduced the revenue of the year

by about one twelve-thousandth part ! An appeal against this ruling having been

made to a still higher authority, a modified order was subsequently issued per-
mitting such Forest officers as desired to possess the book to buy copies and charge
the cost in their office expenditure. I may state that the book was not a private
venture. It was produced at the expense of the Government of Bengal.

     It is not because I like to play the censor that I have made these remarks
about the Forest Department. Having myself served in it from 1860 to 1871,

I can speak from my own experience' as to the value, from the utilitarian point

of view, of a knowledge of the names, affinities, and properties of the trees,
shrubs, and herbs which compose an Indian jungle, and of a knowledge of
these as individual members of the vegetable kingdom rather than as masses of
tissue to be studied through a microscope. The appointment which I held in India

for twenty-six years after leaving the Forest Department gave me full opportunity
of getting into touch with all who interest themselves in a Imowledge of plants,
and of discovering how few of these at the present day are Forest officers. The

majority of the latter, if they love their trees, are content to do so without

knowing their names or relationships ! There are, of course, splendid exceptions

who know as well as love. The general decadence of the teaching of Systematic

Botany in England during the past twenty years is, perhaps, to some extent the cause

of the low estimation in which the science is held by the auihorities of the Indian

Forest Department. Twenty-five years ago Systematic and Morphological Botany,
no doubt, had too great prominence given to them in the teaching at universities

and colleges of this country, and the other branches of Botanical science were too

much neglected, although 1 do not think they were despised. Now it appears to
me that Systematic Botany is too much neglected. I hope it is not also despised !
Few of the systematists who survive in England are now to be found attached to

the universities. They are mostly clustered round the two great Herbaria in
London ; and such of them as have to look to Systematic Botany for the means of

livelihood are not in the receipt of salaries such as one might reasonably expect in

one of the richest countries in the world

The following notes are of the nature of suggestions, since the experiments are

not yet completed, and much has still to be done, no doubt, before the efficacy of the

treatment and the faults and difficulties of the methods in detail are fully demon-

strated                                     but since the author  has found they  can  be  used with some measure of
                                         ;

success, the various workers ' interested in the culture of algse may care to take

the methods up and try to improve them.

     1. If agar is swollen in dilute acetic acid, and then washed very thoroughly
so that every trace of soluble salt is removed, it can be used, mixed with the
necessary culture fluids, as a convenient medium for the growth of some algae, as
Beyjerinck had already observed. But, so far as the author knows, the use of such
a medium for separating algae in plate culture and for observing their growth in
hanging drops has not been attempted. It can be done, however, though the
-- ----

920 EEPOET-- 1899.

high melting-point of the agar and the slimiuess of some algae occasionally
cause difficulties.

     The author has also succeeded in separating algre hy the following methods :

     2. Shake theiu up in sterilised nutritive mineral solutions, mix rapidly with
silica jelly, also sterilised, and pour into glass dishes. With species of Oscillaria
and of Palmella the author has observed growth in hanging drops of this silica
jelly medium under high powers, and has seen sufficient to make it hopeful that

even Diatoms may he cultivated this way ; and it is not impossible that some

modification of the process could be utilised for the culture of marine algse.

     Another device is as follows :

     3. Shake the algae up in the nutritive solution and rapidly mix with sterilised
plaster of paris and pour into dishes. The fixed algse grow in situ in some cases,
but others appear to be too sensitive for such treatment.

Experiments have also been made as follows, with some promise of success :

4. The algae are shaken up in the culture medium, and a large quantity of

lime-water quickly added. Then carbon dioxide gas is passed rapidly through,

and the algae are thrown down with  the  precipitate of  calcium carbonate                                                                                      this is
                                                                                                                                                             ;

poured into dishes as if it were plaster of paris. Perhaps this method could be

utilised in the study of calcareous algae, but with some forms it appears too

drastic. It is possible baryta may succeed with some algae, but the trials have not

yet been completed, and it seems to act as a poison to some. One drawback here is

the difficulty of obviating the use of unsterilised materials.

    It is clear that if once we obtain a pure colony on a glass dish, a trace fished out
with a needle may be used to start other cultures. Season, temperature, intensity

of light, and other factors, are of importance in these matters.

                     By Professor Marshall Ward, F.B.S.

     In illustration of the applications of the methods for use in the culture of algse

Professor Ward described the results of observations of the growth of Oscillaria

tenerrima in hanging drops of silica jelly. The growth of a single filament was
followed for more than a week, and the curve showed that growth ceased during
the hours of darkness, and was coincident with assimilation during the day.

    The author has also obtained light-figures by exposing plates of green algae,
covered with stencil letters, to various intensities of daylight, reflected from

mirrors. When the incident light was not too strong a green letter on a colour-

less ground was found, but with intense illumination the algae exposed on the
letter was killed, while those in the covered area, illuminated only by the diffuse
light, were able to grow ; the result was a colourless letter on a green ground.

    The division of the contents of certain green Protococcoideae into zoospores has

also been seen in hanging drops of algar, &c.

        -- --1. On White-Rot a Bacterial Disease of the T^irniiJ.

                             By Professor M. C. Potter.

      The author has found in the early autumn numerous turnips, whose roots, when
 fully grown, have become completely rotten. The rotten portion presents a white

 glazy appearance, and the tissues are reduced to a soft pulpy condition; the cell-
 walls are much swollen, faintly stratified, and separate from each other along the
 middle lamella. The decaying mass is infested with bacteria, but the most careful
 microscopic search has failed to detect any fungoid hyphae, and no fungi have
 appeared in the experimental cultures.

      The rottenness can be readily introduced into a sound root by inoculation at a
 wounded surface ; from this point the decay spreads rapidly through the root, the
 leaves gradually turn yellow, and in about fourteen days the entire plant has
 succumbed.

     Among the bacteria found in the rotten mass one has been isolated, which,

 when sown from a pure culture on to turnips, under sterile conditions, induces all
 the characteristic effects of the ' white-rot.' The liquid expressed from the pulp
 of one of these cultivations, when passed through a Fasteur-Chamberland filter,
 yields a clear light yellow filtrate, which was found to have the same powerful
 action upon the living cells of the turnip, causing the swelling of the wall and the
· separation of the cells by the dissolution of the middle lamella. This action was

destroyed by boiling. When diluted with four to five volumes of alcohol, the

 extract yields a copious flocculent precipitate ; the precipitate was dried and
922 KEPORT--1899.

dig-ested with a little water, and the solution, after filtration through the Pasteur-
Chamherland filter, was also found to have the same effect upon the cell-walls, the
action again being destroyed by boiling. The Avhole appearance of the sections
corresponded exactly wnth those taken from turnips affected hj the rot. The
bacterium, therefore, secretes a cytase enzyme, which, in healthy living tissues,
dissolves the middle lamella and causes the swelling of the cell-wall. The same
enzyme is produced when the bacterium is grown in Koch's bouillon.

     The bacterium has a single polar tiagellum, and, adopting Migula's classifica-
tion, the author has ventured to describe it under the name Psetidomonas

destructans.

                                                General Characteristics.

     Short rods about 3/^ long by 'S/x broad, with one polar flagellum.
     Rapidly liquefies gelatine, forming circular whitish colonies.

      Agar-agar, whitish glazy growth.

     Stab cultures grow along the track of the wire, rapidly forming a funnel.

      Aerobic.
     Parasitic on turnips, potatoes, carrots, but not beetroot, forming a cytase.
      Copious evolution of carbonic acid during the fermentation.

     Infection hy P. destructans appears always to be introduced at a wound, and
it is powerless to set up decay unless placed in contact with the parenchymatous
cells of the cortex. Having gained an entrance, the organism penetrates the
living tissues by means of the intercellular spaces, and by the action of the enzyme
it breaks through the intercellular substance and traverses the middle lamella.

Many of the intercellular .spaces are crowded with bacteria, and in some sections

they are found lying in the track of the middle lamella.

3. On tlie Influence of the Temioerature of Liquid Hydrogen on the Germi-
      native Power of Seeds. By Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, K.C.M.G.,

        F.R.S.

     Sir William Thiselton-Dyer described some experiments made by Professor
Dewar on the influence of the temperature of liquid hydrogen on the germinative
power of seeds. The most important was one in which five kinds of seeds, varying
in size and conformation, were immersed for six hours in liquid hydrogen. The
temperature to which they were cooled was --453° F. below melting ice. They
were subsequently sown at Kew, and germinated readily without exception.

     The bearing of the experiments on the accepted conception of protoplasm gave
rise to some discussion. Protoplasm is conceived to consist of physiological
molecules, the properties of which cannot be explained with our present knowledge
of either physics or chemistry. They are in a state of constant kinetic energy,
based upon equally continued metabolic change. But if it is admitted that the
latter is impossible at very low temperatures the former must cease and the evi-
dence of life disappears. The physiological molecule becomes purely static; its
energy is wholly potential, and, in fact, it becomes, as Professor Casimir de Candolle
has pointed out, analogous to an explosive.

     Bulgaria polymorpha (Wettstein), B. inqidnans (Fr.), is stated by Liidwig- to
be parasitic on oak. The author has examined its anatomy, and studied it in pure
cultures on wood and in food-material. The white early growth soon becomes
bright orange; small rounded elevations are afterwards formed, which are incipient

reproducti^·e bodies.

     The action on wood is examined in some detail. The fungus grows better on
oak than on pine. The lignified wood-elements are de-lignified. Details as to

the reactions in various stages of its destructive action are dealt with in the paper.

The author does not regard this fungus as of great importance as a wood-destroy-

ing fungus in this country.

         6. On a Disease of Tradescantia fluminensis and T. sebrina.
   By Albert Howard, B.A., Scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge.

     During tbe summer it was found that two species of Tradescantia, viz. T. flu-
minensis and T. sehrina, growing in greenhouses, were being attacked by a fungus.
Diseased leaves and stems were in many cases found to be covered with long white
conidiophores. Pure cultures were made of this form, and the complete develop-
ment was followed out by the hanging-drop method. The fungus proved to be a
species of Botn/osporium. Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining this form
free i'rom another fungus, a species of Cladosporium. Infection experiments, made
with tbe spores and mycelium of the Botri/osporium under the most diverse con-
ditions, failed, nor would the mycelium infect the healthy leaves if previously

invigorated by cultivation.
     It was found in the case of the naturally growing host plants that infection

started either on the upper side of the leaf as a small semitrausparent dot, or from
tbe margin. Tangential sections of the upper epidermis of the leaf containing one

of these transparent areas, and also portions of the infected margin, when grown

in hanging drops, showed in all cases hyphte on the epidermis, which gave rise to
the same species of Cladosporium as that mentioned above, occurring as a weed in
the Botryosporium cultures. The development of this Cladosporium was then
followed out from a single spore by the hanging-drop method, and infection
experiments were made which proved successfiil.

1. On the Localisation of the Irritahility in Geotrojnc Organs.
                    By Francis Darwin, F.li.S.

The seedlings of Setaria, Sorghum, and some other grasses are remarkable for

possessing a liypocotyl or stalk-like part intercalated between the grain and the

cotyledon. Kothert has shown that while the hypocotyl is the motor apparatus,

the sensitiveness to light resides in the cotyledon, which transmits a stimulus to

the hypocotyl, and this results in curvature. The author showed that the coty-

ledon is also a sense organ for gravitation, the stimulus which leads to geotropic

curvature being in like manner transmitted to the hypocotyl. If a seedling of

Sorffhum or Setaria is fi.xed by its grain to a support, so that the hypocotyl is hori-

zontal, it bends apogeotropically till the cotyledon is vertical ; it then ceases to be

geotropically stimulated, and no longer transmits an influence to the region of

curvature. But if the conditions ai-e reversed, if the seedling is supported by its

cotyledon (which is fixed in a horizontal position), while the hypocotyl projects

freely, the result is otherwise. The hypocotyl begins to curve upwards, just as in

the first experiment, but it does not cease to curve when the free end points vertically

upwards                                      the curvature continues indefinitely, so  that  the  hypocotyl curls into  a
                                          ;

spiral of three or four rings. This can only be explained by the assumption that

the geotropic sensitiveness resides in the cotyledon, and that since the cotyledon

remains horizontal it continues to be stimulated, and transmits a continuous

influence to the motor part of the seedling.

             2. Studies in Aracece. By Prof. Douglas Campbell.

     1. The Araceae have been much neglected in studies of the development of the

"flower and embryo, and our knowledge of these is very incomplete.
     2. The materials for the present studies were collected mostly in Jamaica, and

Ainclude species of DieffenhacMa, Aglaonema, Philodendron, and Anthurium.

study was also made of Lysichiton, of Pacific North America.

   A3. study of the development of the ovule indicates that the primitive form is

axial, as in other low monocotyledons.
     4. The early development of the embryo-sac follows the ordinary type. Later,

there is a multiplication of the antipodal cells, and the sac becomes very early
filled with endosperm.

     5. The ovule is often massive, and there is a marked development of mucilage-
secreting hair upon the funiculus and the base of the nucellus.

     6. In all forms so far examined the embryo is destitute of a suspensor, and the
cotyledon is very large, sometimes suggesting the scutellum of the grass-embryo.

     7. The forms with a single carpel are probably most primitive and most nearly
related to the other low monocotyledons.

3. On the Morphology and Life History of the Lndo-Ceylonese Podostemacece.
    By J. C. Willis, Director of the Royal Botanic Garden, Peradeniya,

      Ceylon.

The paper read was an abstract of a forthcoming monograph of the Indian and

Ceylon species of this very remarkable order of water plants, in which the various

Aspecies will be described in detail, both morphologically and ecologically.                      few

typical species were described, their life history explained, showing the extra-

ordinary modifications which the vegetative system has undergone to suit the

needs of life in rising and falling water and in rapid currents. The vegetative

organs consist largely of modified roots forming thallus-like bodies, and bearing
                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.               925

leafy or floral endogenous shoots, and branching themselves in an exo- or endo-
genous manner. The conclusion was drawn that the endo- or exogenous origin of
an organ or a branch is a phenomenon of an adaptive nature in these plants, and
to a large extent in others also. The adaptive modifications of the structure, such
as the gradual reduction through a series of forms of the shoots and leaves, the
increased multiplication of the shoots by vegetative budding, the reduction of the
number of flowers per slioot and the change to anemophily, the increased dorsi-
ventrality, and other characters were shown to be rather correlated with the rise

and fall of the water than with the velocity of the stream. In conclusion some
of the more general questions of morphology were discussed in the light of the
observations made on these plants.

            4. Note on the Anabcena-containing Roots of some Cycads.

                                 By W. G. Freeman.

     Attention was drawn to the manner in which the anabtcna-containing roots
were borne on various members of this group, growing in very poor soil, in an open
garden border in the lioyal Botanic Garden at Peradeniya, in Ceylon.

     In the majority a dense coralloid mass of specialised fleshy roots was found
immediately encircling the main stem.

  -- --In others e.g. Nacrozamia Pevoffskiana normal-looking lateral roots ran

horizontally beneath the ground, giving ofl:' the special algal-containing roots at
intervals. These primary lateral roots were themselves sometimes apogeotropic

for a period, resuming a normal habit of growing downwards again after having

borne the anabsena-eontainino' masses.

5. A Mixed Infection in Abutilon Boots. By E. J. Butler, M.B.

The roots of seedlings of Abtdilon hybrid.s {Darwinii x         ?) in the plant-

houses of Queen's College, Cork, presented tuberoid enlargements, due to at least

two parasites, a Nematode and an Ascomycete.

(1) The Nematode is a Heterodera, apparently identical with H. radicicola.

It is found also in abundance on the roots of Solanum Ccqisicastrum. All stao-es

of the life-history were worked out. If the female penetrates the central connec-

tive tissue of the stele, it does not emerge. The worm will hatch and go through

a part of its development in water containing decomposing roots of Abutilon.

Experiments as to whether it can complete its cycle in liquid are in progress.

    (2) The Ascomycete is a new Thielavia, which I propose to name T. Hartogii,

differing from T. basicola, Zopf, with more abundant gonidia (up to a hundred) in

each pseudo-sporange, and dark green chlamydospores. Only young perithecia
were observed. This is a dangerous parasite under favourable conditions of moisture

and temperature.

   A(3) fungus coexisting with (1) and (2), whose unseptate hypha; and ' cellulose

wall and reproductive  bodies recall  Peronosporese, has  been  partially studied                                                                  it
                                                                                                                                                ;

appears to be relatively harmless.                              ..^

The research was commenced, at Professor Ilartog's suggestion, in the"'Bio-

logical Institute of Queen's College, Cork, and continued under Professor^Van

Tieghem's direction at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris.

          7. The Jurassic Flora of Britain. Bij A. C. Seward, F.R.S.

     Ths Lower Oolite rocks exposed in the cliff-section between Whitby and a few

 miles south of Scarborough have long been famous as affording rich collections of
 fossil plants, which enable us to form a fairly accurate idea of the chief charac-
 teristics of the Jurassic Flora. Plants from the Yorkshire coast are abundantly
 represented in most of the English museums as well as in Continental collections.

The Ferns and Cycadean genera constituted a large proportion of the vegetation,
-with an abundance of one or two species of Equisetites and a few conifers ; no

 trace of imdoubted Angiosperms has so far been discovered.
      The accoimt of the flora includes a description of the more important types, a

general comparison of the English species with recent plants, and remarks on the
characteristics and distribution of the Lower Oolite floras.

                            TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19.

     The following Papers were read :

     1. A new Genus of Palceozoic Plants. By A. C. Seward, F.R.S.

     The description of this genus, which represents a new type of Cycadofilices, is

founded on a single specimen in the Binney Collection of Coal-measure Plants
(presented in 1892 to the Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge). The specimen
·consists of a small piece of stem, unfortunately without the cortical tissues, with

Athe structure of the primary and secondary wood very clearly preserved. strand

of primary xylem, 1-9 cm. in diameter, occupies the axial region; this consists of
large isodia metric or slightly elongated tracheids with multiseriate bordered pits
on their walls, associated with parenchymatous tissue ; the narrow and spirally
thickened protoxylem elements occur at the margin of the primary stele, which
is, therefore, of exarch structure. Surrounding the primary stele there is a broad

cylinder of secondary wood exhibiting anatomical features characteristic of

Cycadean stems. Leaf-traces are given off from the periphery of the primary
strand ; these consist of long tracheids intermixed with parenchyma.

     The features of most interest in the anatomy of this stem are (1) the manner
of origin and behaviour of the leaf-traces ; (2) the exarch structure of the primary
system ; and (.3) the structure of the large primary tracheids.

     The genus is placed among the Cycadofilices, and compared with Heteranyium
and other Palreozoic genera, also with Lxjr/odium and other recent plants.

             2. On the Structure of a Stem of a Bibbed Sigillaria.
                      By Professor C. Eg. Bertrand (Lille).

     The specimen described was obtained by M. Breton from a colliery in the
Hardino'hem district, Pas de Calais ; it presents external features similar to those of
Sigillaria elongata, and the structure of the wood is well preserved. The fragment
of stem measures 100 x 60 mm. and the surface is traversed by 72 ribs. The

primary system (corona) is in places perfectly preserved ; it agrees with that of a
Diploxylon stem and forms a continuous centripetally developed ring. Exteriorly

the primary wood is succeeded by a continuous zone of centrifugal secondary wood,
but the cainbial and phloeum regions have not been preserved. The continuou
corona consists of 10-13 rows of large scalariform tracheids ; its external surface is
characterised by the very prominent teeth which form ridges separated by sinuses.
The narrowest xylem elements are situated in the projecting teeth. The leaf-

traces arise as separate strands from the external face of the primary wood, and
each is detached from the middle of a sinus ; the arrangement of the leaf-traces
suggests an almost regularly verticillate disposition of the appendices. Each leaf-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  927

trace consists of 6 tracheae in the form of a tangentially elongated group, and 6-8
rows of radially disposed centripetal scalariform vessels. The traces consist only
of primary elements, and pass outwards through a medullary ray of the secondary

wood.
     Professor Bertraud compared the Plardinghem specimen with Diploxylon stems

from Oldham, Halifax, and Burntisland, and with a Sigillaria of the Leiodermaria
(smooth-barked) section, S. spimdosa. In S. spimihsa the leaf-traces are given off
from the same position on the corona as in the ribbed stem, but in the former
species the corona consists of separate groups of tracheids as distinct from the
continuous band in the Hardinghem stem. In the Leiodermarian species, as
Renault has shown, the leaf-traces consist in part of secondary xylem.

     In the Diplo.vylon stem from Halifax and Oldham the leaf-traces are given off
from the middle of a sinus of the corona, as in the new Sigillaria, but in the

Burntisland Diploxylon they have a lateral origin, as in Lepidodcndron selaginoides.

        3. On a biserial Halonia belonging to the genus Lepidophloios.
                              £y Professor F. E. Weiss.

    At the Bristol meeting of the British Association, Dr. D. II. Scott exhibited
photographs of this Halonia from the Hough Hill Colliery, Stalybridge, and

pointed out the agreement of its well-preserved internal structure with that of
Zq^idodendron fuliginosum of Williamson. Dr. Scott had most kindly and gene-
rously allowed the author to undertake the further examination of this specimen,

and this completely confirmed the identity of the internal structure of this Halonia
with that of Williamson's Lepidodendron fuliyinosmn. Williamson retained this

name in his ' Memoir,' pt. xix., published in 1893, though Cash and Lomax had
shown conclusively, at the meeting of the British Association at Leeds in 1890,

that this type of structure was revealed by a specimen showing undoubtedly
Lepidophloios leaf-scars, and though Williamson's LejndopMoios, figured in pt. xix.,
also shows the stem structure of the fuliginosum type. The same structure is
shown also by stems of the ordinary multiseriate Halonias, which, as Kidston and
Potonie have shown, belong undoubtedly to the genus Lepidophloios, Stems,
therefore, showing the structure of Lepidodendron fuliginosum (Williamson) should
be referred to the genus Lepndophloios.

     The fruiting branches of this genus, however, termed Halonia, or halonial
branches, have usually a number of rows of spirally arranged tubercles. The
Hough Hill Halonia has onlj- two rows of fructisrerous tubercles. Hence it would
by some palfeobotanists be classed as Ulodendroid, but it seems better to call it a
' biserial Halonia,' since the name of Halonia has been reserved by Kidston and
others for the fruiting branches of Lepidophloios, and also because its elevated
tubercles distinguish it from the usually depressed Ulodendroid scars. As the
Hough Hill Halonia shows no leaf-scars, the author has sought for confirmatory
evidence for his conclusion that Lepidophloios may possess fruiting branches with
two rows of fruit-bearing tubercles. The Lepidophloios figured by Williamson in
his nineteenth ' Memoir ' (figs. 30 to 38), and coming from the same locality, is
described as possessing two rows of halonial tubercles, and this is confirmed by
two pieces of this specimen preserved, one in the Williamson collection in the
British Museum, and another in the Wilde collection in the Manchester Museum.
The author also submitted photographs of two other biserial Halonias showing dis-

tinct Lepido2)hloios leaf-scars, one from the Williamson collection (No. 194GB)
at the British Museum, and one presented by Mr. Dawes to the Manchester
Museum, Owens College. These, he considered, confirmed his conclusion that the

biserial Halonia from the Hough Hill Colliery was also a fruiting branch of

Lepidophloios,

5. Stem- structure in Schizpeaceje, Gleicheniacese, and Hymenophyllaceae.

                                  By L. A. Boodle.

There is a wide difference between the types of stem-structure shown by the

different members of the Schizceacea;. Thus Lygodium has a stele in which the

xylem forms a solid mass in the centre of the stem, and is surrounded by a con-

tinuous ring of phloem pericycle and endodermis.

Aneimia Phyllitidis, on the other hand, has a ring of separate bundles (or

steles), which may be  compared                                 with  those  of Aspiditim         or other Pohjpodiacece
                                                                                                                                                                     ^

each of them consisting of a band of xylem surrounded by a phloem, pericycle,

and endodermis of its ojvn.

Mohria resembles Aneimia Phiillitidis in type. Certain species of Aneimia, e.g.

A. mexicana, have in the internodes a complete ring of xylem bounded on the

inner and outer side by a ring of phloem, pericycle, and endodermis, with a central

pith, and thus resemble Marsilia. Sckizcea has a ring of xylem surrounding a

central pith, but no internal phloem or endodermis.

The above four genera, which make up the Sckizcsacece, agree in having a

stem-protosylem, which is not well marked, as it consists of elements which are

not annular or spiral, and are usually not specially small. Lygodium, Aneimia,

and Mohria are    exarch                                    in  Schizcea, however, the  relative  position  of  the proto-
                                                         ;

xylem has not been made out with certainty.

In their main points the types of stem-structure foimd in the SchizaaceeB

agree with the structures shown at successive levels in the stem of a 'seedling'

plant of Polypoditim, i.e. at successive stages in the ontogeny of such a fern.

Hence the Aneimia type (which corresponds with that of a mature Polypodium)

may be regarded as the more specialised type among the Schizceacew, and Lygodium

(which corresponds in structure with the base of the stem of Polypodium) as the

more primitive type.

The GleicheniacecB and HymenoTphyllacem also include forms with a solid

central mass of xylem, but differing in some details from Lygodium. The proto-

xylem is well marked and composed of annular and spiral elements in both orders.

Gleichenia is mesarch and closely resembles the fossil genus lieterangium.

In the GleicheniacecB the only advance on the Lygodium type is found in

Platyzoma (a subgenus of Gleichenia) in which there is a ring of xylem surround-

ing a central pitb, as in SchizcBa, but differing from the latter plant in having an

inner endodermis.

In the larger species of Trichomanes there is a solid xylem-mass, but with a

group of parenchyma in connection with the one or two protoxylems, which are

more or less centrally placed. In Hymenophyllum the corresponding parenchy-

matous mass is large in proportion to the amount of xylem. In the smallest

species of Trichomanes the stele of the rhizome takes the form of a collateral
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                929

bundlt>. The protoxylem of Trichomanes spicatum, unlike the other species

examined, resembles that of the Scliizmacece.

    The solid stele may be regarded as primitive, the Aneimia type being derived
from it by the following steps :--

     1. Solid central xylem-mass surrounded by phloem, &c.
     2. Ring of xylem surrounding a central pith.
     ,'J. Ring of xylem with internal phloem, endodermis, and pith.
     4. Ring of separate bundles formed by the breaking up of the above vascular

ring, owing to large leaf-gaps.

     The Aneimia type thus explained would not be polystelic, in the morphological
sense of the word, "but the separate bundles would represent peripheral parts of an
origiually solid stele, in which the central part has been replaced by parenchyma,
additional pieces of phloem and endodermis having been differentiated to complete

the concentric bundles.

          6. ¥otes on IncUaruhher. By R. H. Bifpen, Cambridge.

     ytarcb and caoutchouc appear not to occur together. Caoutchouc occurs as
small particles in latex, and coagulation begins with their running together.
Certain reagents will bring this about ; but it is better to avoid all chemical pro-

cesses, any of which do harm. Two physical processes are now being used.

(1) The latex, mixed with water, is strained and churned; the thick cream which
rises to the surface is pressed through rollers and converted into rubber. (2) The
author's process consists in separating the rubber with a centrifugal apparatus.

Details are given in the paper regarding the chemical properties of the different
kinds of rubber obtained from Hevea, Castilloa, Mcmilwt, Ficus, Hancornia,

KicJcsia, Artocarpits, and Clitsia. The author also raises some questions of theo-
retical interest with regard to possible relations between caoutchouc, starch, and

resin-bodies, and indicates lines for further inquiry.

7. Some Isolated Observations hearing on the Function of Latex.
                              By J. Parkin, M.A.

    The author has lately returned from a year's sojourn in Cieylon, where he has
been acting as scientific assistant to Mr. Willis, the Director of the Royal Botanic
Gardens. During his time there he has been principally engaged in investigations
on caoutchouc-yielding trees, chiefly Hevea brasiliensis (Para Rubber), and Cas-
tilloa elastica var. (a Central American Rubber-tree). The results of this research
are contained in a recently-published cii'cular of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Cey-
lon, entitled ' Caoutchouc or Indiarubber,' intended primarily for those interested

in rubber cultivation.
     The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to some of the observations and

experiments recorded in the Circular, which, besides their practical value, have a

general botanical interest, and also to make public other observations which may

throw light on the functions of laticiferous tissue. It is arranged in six sections.

T'he main features of these are here briefly given.
     Section I. is occupied chiefly with the coagulation of the latex of Hevea.

Coagulation is now known to be brought about by the proteid contained in the
latex passing from a soluble to an insoluble state. The latex of Hevea is not
coagulable by heat or slight additions of alkalies, but is coagulable in the cold, by
small quantities of acids. The approximate weight of acid required to clot com-

pletely 100 c.c. of latex has been worked out for sulphuric, hydrochloric, nitric,
aceticj oxalic, tartaric, and citric acids. Experimental evidence points to the
l)roteid in question being alkali-albumen rather than ordinary albumen. It has

previously been called albumen.

     The behaviour of this latex towards certain saline solutions has also been
investigated. Mercuric chloride is shown to be a powerful coagulator.

930 REPORT-- 1899.

Section II. contains observations and remarks relating to the carbohydrates of

latex.

Sugar in variable proportions is of frequent occurrence in latex. The little

contained in the trunk-latex of Hevea seems to be cane-sugar.

    It is suggested that the sugar may arise, in part at least, from the surrounding
injured tissues, and may not be always originally present in the latex.

The starch-rods so characteristic of the laticiferous tubes of Euphovbia and

allied genera have been found still present in the turned and fallen leaves of the

following species examined : Euphorbia ^yidcJierrima, E. Bojeri, E. rothiana, Pedi-

lanthus tithymaloides, Hiira crepitans, ExccBcaria bicolor, and Sapiion biglandv,-
losum. This fact is somewhat opposed to the view of these tubes functioning as
conductors of starch from the leaf.

     In Section III. reasons are given for thinking that in some caoutchouc trees
the latex of the young stems and leaves differs in the composition of its globules

in suspension from that of the trunk and main branches. While the latter yield

rubber free of stickiness, the former give a somewhat viscous substance with

feeble elasticity. Such is the case with Hevea, Castilloa, Landolphia Kirldi, Ficu>i
elastica, and tirceola esculenta.

Section IV. treats of an important fact connected with the tapping of Hevea

trees, viz., that wounding the bark causes a greater flow of latex from subsequent
Ainjuries.
            point first indicated in the experiments of Mr. WiUis, who found that

the weight of rubber obtained from the second tapping was about double that
from the first. The author has followed this up with some instructive results.

     In Section V. a peculiarity in the exudation of latex from the severed base of
the petiole of Hevea brasilicnsis and Phmiiera acutifolia is described and

discussed.

     In Section VI. a special laticiferous system developed in the inmiature seed of
Hevea hrasiliensis is brought to notice.

The paper concludes with general remarks and suggestions on the origin and

functions of laticiferous tissue.

8. Intumescences of Hibiscus vitifolius (Z.). By Miss E. Dale, Cambridge.

                                   I. Aiiatoniical Part.

     The plants on which the following observations were made were grown, directly

or indirectly, from seed from Somaliland. The intumescences, which vary in size

and shape, occur on the leaves, stems, green parts of the flower, and on the young
fruit. Some are entirely colourless; others are green at the base. Those on (1)
the leaf differ from those on (2) the stem,

1. On the leaf\h& intumescences are of two types.

(a) Purely epidermal.

(/3) Partly sub-epidermal.

a. The purely epidermal and smaller type consists of one or two tiers, of "much

elongated, thin-walled cells, usually twisted spirally round one another.  At the

apex is a stoma, which may or may not lead into an intercellular space.
     (i. The larger outgrowths contain basal prolongations of parenchyma.

     2. On the steyi the outgrowths are more complex, and usually larger. The

basal part consists of elongated sub-epidermal cells divided by periclinal walls.
The upper part is made up of much enlarged, thin-walled epidermal ceUs, similarly
divided. The outgrowths later become cut off by cork, which arises in the lowest
row of daughter cells derived from the original epidermis, i.e. in the lowest

colourless cells ; after suberisation of these cells the outgrowth shrivels.

                                               II. Experimental Part.

     Seedlings were raised in the Tropical Pit, and eight of them were planted, each
in a separate pot, and allowed to grow on under identical conditions. They all
                            --

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.           931

developed intumescences, and were all very much alike. When each had about

nine or ten leaves, and was beginning to flower, the plants were placed under
different conditions, and examined at the end of six weeks :

     The plant grown iji the open was entirely free from intumescences ; it was par-
ticularly vigorous, and had strong lateral branches.

     The plant in the temperate house had outgrowths only on the laider sides of
the leaves, and on the flowers and fruits.

     The plant in the filmy fern-house was very unhealthy, but had no outgrowths.
     All the other plants had outgrowths on one or both sides of most of the leaves,
on the stems, the green parts of the flowers, and on the young fruits.

                                                                   Conclusiims,

     As far as the evidence goes at present, it seems to point to the conclusion that

the intumescences are pathological, and are due neither to insects nor to fungi,
but to the direct effects of environment. The formation of outgrowths appear to
be caused by excessive moisture combined with a high temperature. If the
temperature is low the plants do not appear to have strength to form them. The
production of outgrowths seems to be a response on the part of the plant to

insufficient transpiration.

   --Note. Similar, but less well-marked, outgrowths were observed on the leaves

of plants of Ceratotheca triloba. As in the case of Hibiscus vitifolim, they were

not formed in a plant placed in the open ground.

    Outgrowths which may prove to be of the nature of those in Hibiscus vitifolius
have been described by Sorauer in Bracmna {angusti/oUa, kc), Cassia tomentosa,

Acacia {semiJevflorens, &c.).
