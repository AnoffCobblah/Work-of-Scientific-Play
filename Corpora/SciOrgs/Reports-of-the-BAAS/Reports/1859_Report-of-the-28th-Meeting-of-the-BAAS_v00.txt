Report of the Council of the Biutish Association as puesf.nted
     TO THE General Committee at Leeds, September 22nd, 1858.

   1. With reference to the subjects referred to the Council by the General
Committee at Dublin, the Council have to report as follows:

   a. The General Committee passed the following resolution, viz.:
   " That it is of great importance to the progress of Science that the Mag-
netic Observations which have already added so much to our knowledge of

terrestrial magnetism, should be continued. That the influence of the Asso-
ciation will be well employed in attaining this object, and that it is desirable
to obtain the cooperation of the Royal Society. That a Committee be ap-
pointed, consisting of the President, the Rcv.Dr. Robinson, and Major-General
Sabine, to request, on the part of the British Association, the cooperation of
the President and Council of the Royal Society, and to take in conjunction
with them such steps as may appear necessary, including, if it be thought
desirable, an application to Government."

  A copy of this resolution was transmitted soon after the Dublin Meeting

by the President, Dr. Lloyd, to Lord Wrottesley, President of the Royal
Society, accompanied by the following letter:

 My -- " Nov. 6, 1857.

" Loun, At the Meeting of the Britisli Association wliich was held

at Dublin in August last, a llesoluJion was adopted proposing the continuance

of the system of Magnotical Observations which was commenced under the

auspices of the Royal Society and of the British Association in 184'0; and a

Committee, consisting of the President of the Association, Kev. Dr. Robinson,

and General Sabine, was appointed, to request the cooperation of the Presi-

dent and Council of the Royal Society in the endeavour to attain this object,

and to take in conjunction with them such steps as may appear desirable for

that end. If this proposal should commend itself to your Lordship's judg-

ment, and that of the Council of the Royal Society, I have to request, on the

part of the gentlemen above named, that you will be pleased to nominate a

Committee of the Royal Society to confer with them, and to take such further

steps in conjunction with them as may seem expedient.

"I have the honour to be, My Lord,

          " Your most obedient Servant,

(Signed)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                " H. Lloyd."

" To tJic Right Hon. the Lord Wrottesley, P.R.Sr

In consequence of this letter, the President and Council of the Royal

Society appointed a Committee, consisting of Sir John Herschel, Bart., the
Rev. Dr. VVheweil, the Rev. The Dean of Ely, and the Astronomer Royal
(who had been members of the Committee of Physics, by wlioni the former

Report on terrestrial magnetism in 1839-40 had been drawn up) to consider

the progress and present state of Magnetical Investigation ; and to take, in
conjunction with the Committee appointed by the British Association, such

steps as should appear advisable for its further prosecution                                                                                                                                                                                                            including, if it
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

should be deemed desirable, an application to Government.

The mode of proceeding pursued by the two Committees has been hitherto

that of independent deliberation, with occasional intercommunication by
correspondence. The conclusions which have been arrived at by the two

Committes being, it is understood, substantially the same, a united Meeting

has been appointed to take place at Leeds, in the present week, at which a

joint report may be drawn up, and may be presented to the General Com-
mittee at its meeting on Monday next, when such further steps may be

taken in reference to the subject as may appear desirable.

   h. The General Committee assembled at Dublin directed that "an appli-
cation should be made to Her Majesty's Government to send a vessel to

examine and survey the entrance to the Zambesi River in South Africa, and

to ascend the river as far as may be found practicable for navio-ation."

   The President, and the Committee to whom the charge of this application

was entrusted, having placed themselves in communication with Dr. Livino--

stone, presented the following Memorial to the Earl of Clarendon, Her Ma-

jesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs :

   " Dr. Livingstone's successful travels in Africa, and the account which he
has given of them at public meetings in the metropolis and in several of the

principal provincial towns of the United Kingdom, have excited throughout

the country a strong desire to obtain more full particulars regarding the
productions, capabilities, and accessibility of that portion of the globe,

   " The Zambesi River appears byDr.Livingstone's account to furnish means

of communication with the interior of Southern Africa similar to those which

the Quorra and Binue have been found to afford in Central Africa. The

object of the present application is to bring under the consideration of Her

Majesty's Government the expediency of availing themselves of the oppor-
                        --

--XXX REPORT 1858.

tunity of Dr. Livingstone's return to Africa, to employ a suitable vessel in the
ensuing season to obtain, witli his assistance, a more correct knowledge than

we now possess, of tlie facilities which the Zambesi would afford for com-
merce, and of the extent to which its waters may be navigable ; and also to

procure a more exact knowledge of the natural productions of the country,
and of the availability of the supplies of coal and other mineral substances
which are stated to exist in the vicinity of the river."

   Early in November the Committee, accompanied by Dr. Livingstone, were
favoured with a personal interview by Lord Clarendon, who was pleased to
express a warm interest in the proposed Expedition, and promised that it
should receive the favourable consideration of Her Majesty's Government.
The expectation thus raised has been fully realized ; a vote of money was
moved iDy the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and sanctioned by the House of
Commons; and the Expedition has since sailed, having had the advantage of
receiving from the Royal Society, on Lord Clarendon's invitation, suggestions
as to the scientific objects which the Expedition may be made to subserve,
without interference with its primary and immediate purpose, and having
been furnished at the Observatory of the British Association at Kew, with
scientific instruments, and with personal instruction in their use.

   c. The General Committee, at Dublin, directed that application should be
made to Her Majesty's Government " to send a vessel to the vicinity of the
Mackenzie River, for the purpose of making a series of MagneticObservations
with special reference to the determination of the laws now known to rule
the magnetic storms " The General Committee entrusted this application to

Athe President, assisted by a Committee named in the Resolution. Memorial,

setting forth the grounds and object of the application, having been prepared
by the Committee, Avas presented to Lord Palmerston on the 31st of October,
with a request from the Committee to be favoured with an interview.

   The Memorial was as follows :

   "Among the most important results of scientific research during the last

twenty years, is the addition which has been made to our knowledge of Ter-
restrial Magnetism. The variation of its direction and intensity dependent on

the observer's position on the globe, have been ascertained with a precision
which already affords material assistance to the seaman ; and those variations
which are connected with the hour of the day, or season of the year, have
been also carefully investigated. But, as always happens in real progress,

the advance which has been made has shown new ground which ought to be
explored. Without referring to the magnetic influence, which we have now

reason to believe is exerted on our planet both by the sun and moon, a still
more interesting fact has recently been established. It has long been known
that the earth's magnetism is affected by sudden disturbances, occasionally
so great as even to interfere with its practical applications ; but it has been
very recently discovered that these magnetic storms (as they have been called)
are themselves subject to periodic laws. Their study is evidently of the
highest importance towards the discovery of the physical causes which are
engaged in producing magnetic phenomena, and a fortunate circumstance

has pointed out one method of pursuing it. During the years in which Her

Majesty's Ship 'Plover' was stationed at Point Barrow, as a part of the
squadron which was searching for the traces of Sir J. Franklin, and his noble
companions, her officers, under the superintendence of their gifted com-
mander R. Maguire, made a valuable series of magnetic observations, the more
precious from their peculiar position, and the great care with which they were

conducted. On reducing these and comparing their results with those ob-

tained at Toronto, the most famous of the British Magnetic Observatories,

some very remarkable facts were elicited respecting tlie magnetic storms.

At both stations they occur simnltaneously ; but with the significant differ-

ence that their directions are opposite. This indicates so clearly the relation

of these disturbances to a point somewhere between Point Barrow and

Toronto, that it appeared to the Physical Section of the British Association,

when discussing at its late Meeting these observations, of high importance

to have them continued and extended. For this purpose a location in or

near Mackenzie River appears the most suitable, as very well situated with

respect to the other two, and as easily accessible without any extraordinary

risk, or chance of long detention. The same instruments are available ; and

as there are many officers in Her Majesty's Navy perfectly competent to use

them, it is confidently expected that the result would be alike beneficial to

this department of Physical Science, and honourable to our country."

No reply having been received to this communication, the following letter

was addressed, on the 4th of January, by the President, to G. C. Barrington,

Esq., private Secretary to Lord Palmerston :--

                                                                                                                   " January 4, 1858.

 --" Sir, On the 31st of October I communicated to Lord Palmerston a

resolution adopted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science,

making application to Her Majesty's Government to send a vessel to the

vicinity of the Mackenzie River, for the purpose of obtaining in that region

certain observations, which recent discoveries in Terrestrial Magnetism had

proved to be of high importance to science ; and I enclosed at the same time

a Memorial, setting forth in detail the grounds of the application.

" As the time for making the necessary preparations for such an expedition

has now fully arrived, I trust I shall not be deemed unreasonable in recalling,

through you, his Lordship's consideration to the subject.

" In reference to this part of the question, I beg to enclose a letter from

Captain Maguire, who commanded H.M.S. ' Plover' in the same seas in 1852,

185.3, 1854, and who is probably the best authority on the subject. It will

be seen from it, that there is still sufficient time to equip a vessel for the

forthcoming season. As respects the kind of vessel required, and the nature

of the equipment, the same officer writes as follows, in a letter dated the 5th

of November last, addressed to General Sabine :

 --" ' One of the despatch gun-vessels will answer very well. There are also

many sailing-sloops now lying idle such as the 'Frolic' and ' Espiegle,' or

many others, that might be made available at a trifling expense. The strength-

ening need not be much ; and a very small auxiliary steam-power, sufficient

to propel the vessel two or three knots in a calm, would suffice to carry her

through the land-water of the north coast from Point Barrow. The shores

from thence to the Mackenzie afford, in every part, an ample supply of drift-

wood fit for steaming purposes.'

" As I believe that one of the chief objections, on the part of Her Majesty's

Government, to further expeditions to the Arctic Seas, is the danger to the

lives of the seamen employed in the service, I think it right to add, that an

--expedition to this locality will be attended with no unusual risk, and that,

on the other hand, it may afford important support to the gallant crew who
are now engaged in the final search for the traces of the Franklin Expedition,

if the commander should be induced by circumstances, which are not im-

probable, to push his vessel westward.

" I have the honour to be. Sir,

                                                              " Your obedient Servant,

   2. The General Committee at Dublin having placed £500 at the disposal

of the Council, to be employed in maintaining the establishment, and pro-

vidiu"- for tiie continuance of special researches at the Kew Observatory, the
Report of the Committee to whom the Council have confided the superin-
tendence of the Kew Observatory is herewitli annexed, testifying to the great
and still increasing public utility of that establishment. The General Com-

mittee will recognize with jjleasure, in tiie contribution of £150 received from
the Royal Society, for the purchase of improved tools for the workshop of the
Observatorj', a fresh evidence of the readiness of the President and Council

of that body to aid the objects of the Kew Observatory, by special grants

from time to time for particular purposes.

   3. Since the communication made by the President and Council of the Royal

Society to the General Committee in Dublin, relative to the formation of a
" Catalogue of the Philosophical papers contained in the various scientific
Transactions and Journals of all Countries" (printed copies of which com-
munication were distributed amongst the members of the General Committee
in Dublin), this important work has been commenced under the auspices and

at the expense of the Royal Society. It is purposed that it should include the
titles (in the original languages) of all Memoirs published in such works, in

the Mathematical, Physical, and Natural Sciences, from the foundation of the
Royal Society to the present time : the titles to be so arranged as to form

--ultimately three catalogues, one chronological, or in the order of the me-
--moirs in the several series, one alphabetical, according to authors' names,

and, lastly, a third, classified according to subjects. The superintendence of

this work has been undertaken by the oflScers of the Royal Society, assisted

by a Select Committee of the Fellows.

   4. The Council have added to the list of Corresponding Members of the
Association the names of the following foreign gentlemen, who were present

at the Dublin Meeting, and made communications to the Sections, viz.:

       Dr. Barth.                    Viscenza Pisani, Florence.
       Professor Bolzani, Kazan.     Gustave Plaar, Strashurg.
       Antoine d'Abbadie, Paris.
       Professor Loomis, Nexo York.  Herman Schlagintweit, Berlin,

                                     Robert Schlagintweit, Berlin.

   5. The General Secretary has informed the Council that he communicated
to His Royal Highness The Prince Consort the resolution of the General
Committee at Dublin, viz. :

   " That application be made to His Royal Highness The Prince Consort for
permission to elect him President of the British Association for the year 1 859,"
and that he had received in reply the following letter:

                                                                                                   "Balmoral, Sept. 17, 1857.

 --" SiK, I have communicated to His Royal Highness The Prince Consort

your letter of the 13th inst., expressing, on the part of the Committee of the
British Association, the wish that His Royal Highness would allow himself
              UEPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                         XXXIH

to be nominated as President of the Meeting which it is proposed to hold at

Aberdeen in 1859.

" His Royal Highness cannot but feel gratified at the wish thus expressed

by the Committee, though he is sensible that his own proficiency in scientific

subjects is scarcely such as to entitle him to such a distinction. If, therefore,

he expresses his readiness to comply with the wishes of the Committee, he

begs that it may be considered merely as an expression of the deep interest

which he takes in the advancement of science in tiiis country, and as a mark

of the high sense which he entertains of the importance and usefulness of the

Association.

   " His acceptance of the Presidency must also be considered, to a certain

--degree, conditional depending upon his being in Scotland at the time pro-

posed for the Meeting.

" His Royal Highness's time is not his own, and it is impossible for him,

at this distance of time, to say whether the call of other duties may not be

such as to prevent his attendance.

                        " I have the honour to be. Sir,

   6. The Report of the Parliamentary Committee of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science has been received by the Council, and is

herewith presented.

Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for the

                   Advancement of Science, for 1857-58.

Since the last Meeting of the Association, a set of Magnetical Instruments

have been prepared, at the request of the Council of the Royal Society, and

the constants determined for the Expedition of Dr. Livingstone to South

Africa. Capt. Bedingfield, R.N. and Messrs. Livingstone and Baines, who

accompany Dr. Livingstone in this Expedition, received instructions at the

Observatory in the use of the instruments.

At the request of Capt. Washington, R.N., Hydrographer of the Admiralty,

similar instruments were prepared for the Oregon Boundary Commission,

and instructions in their use were given at tlie Observatory to Capt. Haig,
R.A., and Lieut. Darrah, R.E.

Detailed written instructions for both Expeditions, supplementary to those

contained in the Admiralty Manual, were furnished by Mr. Welsh. Such

instructions necessarily occupied the time and attention of Mr. Welsh and

his assistants ; but as, in the opinion of the Committee, instructions for the

correctly manipulating with instruments with which gentlemen appointed to

a particular service are not often previously acquainted, is an essential fea-

ture in the practical working of a physical observatory, the Committee have

considered it desirable that such assistance should be afforded ; and it will
be in the recollection of the Council that, in their last Report, the Committee

stated that several gentlemen, some of whom were connected with foreign

Governments, had received similar instruction.

  An application having been received from M. Secchi of the CoUegio Ro-
mano, on the part of the Roman Government, for Magnetical Instruments,

these instruments have been prepared at the Observatory and forwarded to
Rome. They consist of an Observatory Bifilar Magnetometer and Balance

Magnetometer, similar to those employed in the British Colonial Observato-
ries, a Unifilar Magnetometer, and a Dip Circle.

   Application has also been received from the Rev. Alfred Weld for Mag-

netical and Electrical apparatus for the Stonyhurst College ; these are in

course of preparation, and Mr. Weld has received instructions in the use of

the magnetical instruments.

   Two Dip Circles by Barrow, furnished with Dr. Lloyd's apparatus for the

total force, which were sent to the Observatory preparatory to their being
forwarded to the Austrian and Russian Governments, were carefully examined

and adjusted.

   An extensive series of observations made with various dipping-needles and

circles, have confirmed the results previously obtained at the Observatory as

to the value of the Magnetic dip.
   The Self-recording Magnetometers have been in regular action since the

1st of January, and have performed satisfactorily; some difficulty arose in
tlie manipulation of the Balance-magnet, but this has been surmounted, and

this instrument now performs with as much accuracy and delicacy in its

action as either the Declinometer or Bifilar Magnet.
   The Photoheliograph erected in the dome of the Observatory was fully

described in the last Annual Report; it has been repeatedly at work since the

beginning of last March, and excellent photographic pictures of the solar
spots and faculae were obtained. Certain alterations have been made by

Mr. Welsh in order to regulate the time of exposure of the collodion plate
to the sun's action ; with these alterations the instrument gives very good
results, but certain improvements in the arrangements of the secondary mag-

nifying lens are under consideration, with the view of avoiding the depiction
on the collodion negative of the inequalities in the glasses which compose it.

    The Committee recommend that arrangements should be made for the
appointment of a competent Assistant, who will undertake the taking of the
photographs and the preparing of a certain number of copies for distribution

to some of the principal British and Foreign observatories.
    George Whipple has been engaged to assist in the general work of the

 Observatory at a weekly pay of ten shillings.

    Mr.Beckley's arrangement of the Anemometer described at the Cheltenham

Meeting of the Association has been adopted and carried out in an apparatus
made by Mr. Adie for the East India Company. This anemometer having
been mounted at the Observatory, remained for some time, and was found to

perform satisfactorily ; it was shown to many persons, and examined by
Admiral FitzRoy, General Sabine, and Mr. Osier, members of the Anemo-
meter Committee. Certain modifications since suggested by Mr. Beckley,
have been adopted in two instruments constructed by Mr. Adie for Admiral

 FitzRoy's department in the Board of Trade.
    The verification of Meteorological Instruments has been continued on the

same plan as in previous years. The following have been verified since the

last meeting of the Association to the 1 st of July :

For the Admiralty             Baro- Thermo-    Hydro-

For Opticians and others      meters, meters,  meters.

REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.        XXXV

the United States, and 6 barometers and 6 thermometers for the Portuguese

Government.
   Mr. Welsh is at present completing the Magnetic Survey of Scotland, for

the expense of which £200 has been received by the Committee from the

Admiralty.

   The Committee finding it desirable that the workshop of the Observatory
should be furnished with a superior lathe and planing machine, authorized
their Chairman to apply to the Council of the Royal Society for the sum of
£150; this amount was immediately awarded from the Donation Fund, and
a very superior lathe, by Whitworth, and a planing machine have been pur-
chased at a cost of £149 7s.

   The present as well as the former Annual Reports of the Committee, show
the practical scientific objects for which the Observatory has for so many
years been used, and at no former period was it in so effective a state as at

present ; the valuable tools that have (by the liberality of the Royal Society)

been placed in the workshop, enable Mr. Beckley to repair and make appa-
ratus and instruments of the most complex and delicate construction ; much
of this work would otherwise have been sent to different workshops in the
Metropolis, entailing not only great loss of time, but often a want of accu-

racy in the construction : the value of such arrangements in the Observatory

can be easily appreciated by scientific observers.

   On the 24th of last April, the Committee presented an estimate of the

expenditure for the present year, a copy of which had been previously for-
warded by the Chairman to the President, whose reply, addressed to General

Sabine, the Committee now present as a part of their Annual Report.

                                                                " Trinity College, Dublin, December 7, 1857.

 --" Dear Sabine, I have received from Mr. Gassiot the Financial Report

of the Kew Committee, which I hope may soon be laid before the Council.

It appears from it that the expenditure of the Observatory is likely to increase

with the increased activity of the establishment, while part of the income

that, namely, derived from the verification of meteorological instruments

will probably diminish in future years.

   " I am not sufficiently acquainted with the working of the Observatory to
say, from my own knowledge, how far an augmentation of the existing staff

--is necessary. But if the Council should judge that it is as stated in the
--Report of the Committee they will have to consider from what external

source provision may be made for the increased expenditure ; for I presume

that it will not be thought prudent, that the Association, with its fluctuating

and uncertain income, should augment its grant beyond the present amount.

   " Upon this point I may remark, that the President and Council of the

Royal Society have already evinced their sense of the value of the Observatory,

by making a liberal grant to it for a special object ; and that it is therefore not

improbable that they may be willing to contnhnte permanently to its support.

Its objects are at least as clearly allied to those of the Royal Society, as to those
of the British Association; and if it should be deemed that those objects

have been in great measure attained, and that the establishment has proved

itself deserving of permanent maintenance, it would seem expedient to place

it on a more fixed basis than the present.
    " I will only add, that believing, as I do, that the Observatory has already

done much, and is capable of doing more, for the advancement of physical

science, I should deplore the restriction of its efficiency, by insufficient pecu-

niary means, as a loss to science.

                                    " Believe me, sincerely yours,

« To General Sabine, E.A., ^-c"     " H. Lloyd."

   The above is the actual expenditure, but the real annual increase in salaries
is about £61 : the difference in the above statement arises from the termination
of the financial year being one month later than last year. In the detailed
statement of receipts and expenditure, it will be observed that the amount

received for verification of meteorological instruments has decreased, arising
from the circumstance that the Meteorological department of the Govern-

ment is now well provided with a store of instruments for its use.
   As the financial position of the Observatory will probably be brought

forward by the Council at the General Meeting of the Association at Leeds,

the Committee suggest that the time has now arrived when strenuous efforts
should be made to obtain such an amount of pecuniary aid as would ensure

the permanent efficient working of this practical physical Observatory ; for
although the establishment is conducted with the strictest economy, the
necessary work connected with the Observatory unavoidably creates a cor-

responding increase in the amount of the annual expenditure.

                                                          John P. Gassiot, Chairman,

      Kew Observatory,

    10th September, 1858.

Report of the Parliamentary Committee to the Meeting of the British
                      Association at Leeds, in September 185b.

The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as follows:

That on their representation the late President of the Board of Trade had

so far acceded to the suggestions of the President and Council of the Royal

Society, supported by the British Association, as to consent to the construc-

tion of one Anemometer with Dr. Robinson's Revolving Cups, which would

Webe erected at Bermuda.       believe, however, that another instrument of

the same description will be erected at Halifax, at the cost of the Board of

Admiralty. These Anemometers are to be constructed on a principle devised

by Mr. Welsh of the Kew Observatory, and they will cost about £50 each.

  We are happy to be enabled to add, that the late President of the Board of

Trade, on a representation made to him by us of the insufficiency of the

                                                                                                    1

accommodations and Staff at the Meteorological Department of the Board
of Trade, consented to the appointment of two additional clerks and of a
working optician, to be permanently attached to that Department ; and, more-
over, supplied more enlarged accommodations; so that, upon the whole,
Admiral FitzRoy, who so ably presides over this Meteorological Depart-
ment, expresses himself as satisfied with the present arrangements, and hope-
ful as to the future success of an institution which cannot fail to be pro-

ductive of vast benefit to science.

  We regret extremely that the application to the Government to send the

Expedition to the Mackenzie River was unsuccessful ; but we anticipate an

important accession to our scientific knowledge from the Expedition to the
Zambesi River, which was sanctioned, and sent out under the able conduct
of the enterprising and distinguished Livingstone, for this Expedition was
well supplied with the necessary instruments properly tested at Kew, and

comprises those who are fully competent to use them.

   We have been again in correspondence with Mr. Patterson, of Belfast, in

reference to the cost of appointments of new Trustees to Museums and

other Scientific Institutions. It appears that a clause in the Literary and
Scientific Societies' Act, extends the facilities given by the 13 and 14; Vict.
c. 28, or the Religious Societies' Act, to Scientific Societies; but that

the clause giving such facilities applies to real estate only. There may be
some technical difficulties in the way of including personalty, but the subject

 will not be lost sight of.

    The appointment of the Right Hon. Joseph Napier to the office of Lord

 Chancellor of Ireland, has unhappily caused another vacancy in our body.

 There are now therefore two vacancies, one of which we recommend should
 be supplied by the election of the Right Hon. Sir John Pakington, M.P. for

 Droitvvich.

   A Memorial having been presented to the Government on the subject of

 the proposed severance from the British Museum of its Natural History Col-

 lections, signed by 114 persons comprising the most eminent promoters and

 cultivators of science, the same was moved for in the House of Commons by

 Sir Philip Grey Egerton and produced. We know of no measure which

 might be adopted by the Government or Legislature, which would inflict a

 deeper injury on science, than the removal of these Collections, if unhappily

 carried into effect.

   We remain of the same opinion which we expressed in our last Report,

 that no convenient opportunity has yet occurred to submit to the consider-
 ation of the Legislature the twelve Resolutions of the Council of the Royal

 Society; but we consider that it is difficult to over-estimate the importance

 of having ascertained and embodied in these Resolutions the opinions of the
 most distinguished living cultivators of science on its desiderata. They con-

ment of the Board of Trade the desirableness of connecting with its arrange-
ments a system for the observation and record of Oceanic and Littoral
Earthquakes and of the occasional occurrence upon the coasts of Great Sea
Waves, and, if practicable, of bringing such into immediate operation.

    That it is highly desirable that a series of Magnetical and Meteoro-
logical Observations on the same plan as those which have been already
carried on in the Colonial Observatories for that purpose under the direction
of Her Majesty's Board of Ordnance, be obtained, to extend over a period of
not more than five years, at the following stations :

                                  1. Vancouver Island.

the establishment of Observatories at these stations for the above-mentioned
term, on a personal and material footing, and under the same superin-
tendence as in the Observatories (now discontinued) at Toronto, St. Helena,
and Van Diemen's Land.
    That the observations at the Observatories now recommended, should be
comparable with, and in continuation of, those made at the last-named Ob-
 servatories, including four days of term observations annually.

    That provision be also requested at the hands of Her Majesty's Govern-
 ment for the execution within the period embraced by the observations of

 magnetic surveys in the districts immediately adjacent to those stations,
 viz. of the whole of Vancouver Island and the shores of the Strait sepa-

-- --rating it from the main land, of the Falkland Isles, and of the immediate

 neighbourhood of the Chinese Observatory (if practicable), wherever

--situated, on the plan of the surveys already executed in the British posses-

 sions in North America and in the Indian Archipelago.

    That a sum of ^350 per annum, during the continuance of the ob-

 servations, be recommended to be placed by Government at the disposal of
 the General Superintendent, for the purpose of procuring a special and
 scientific verification and exact correspondence of the magnetical and me-
 teorological instruments, both of those which shall be furnished to the
 several Observatories, and of those which, during the continuance of the
 observations for the period in question, shall be brought into comparison

 with them, either at Foreign or Colonial Stations.
--xlii REPORT 1858.

that provision be made for their printing in abstract, with discussion, but that
the Terra Observations, and those to be made on the occurrence of Magnetic

mStorms, be still printed extenso ; and that the registrj^ of the observations

be made in triplicate, one copy to be preserved in the office of the General
Superintendent, one to be presented to the Royal Society, and one to the
Royal Observatory at Greenwich, for conservation and future reference.

Highness the Prince Consort, the President elect of the British Association

for the ensuing year.

   That the attention of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty be
requested to the importance of authorizing further researches on the
depth, temperature, and specific gravity of the Sea, more especially in rela-
tion to the communications between distant shores by means of Electric

Telegraph Cables.

                     Applications for Reports and Researches.

procuring instruments for determinations of Geographical Position, of the most
approved portable construction, and properly verified. That the interest of
Geographical Science would be materially advanced by similar measures

being taken by the Kew Committee in respect to such Instruments, to those

which have proved so beneficial in the case of Magnetical and Meteorological

Instruments.

RICHARD OWEN, M.D., V.P.R.S., D.C.L., F.L.S. etc.,

· Gentlemen of the British Association,

We are liere met, in tliis our 28th annual assembly, having accepted, for

tlie present year, the invitation of the flourishing town and firm seat of

British manufacturing energy, Leeds, to continue the aim of the Associa-

tion, which is the promotion of Science, or the Knowledge of the Laws of

Nature ; whereby we acquire a dominion over Nature, and are able so to

apply her powers as to advance the well-being of society and exalt the con-
dition of mankind. It is no light matter, therefore, the work that we are

here assembled to do.

   God has given to man a capacity to discover and comprehend the laws by

which His universe is governed ; and man is impelled by a healthy and

natural impulse to exercise the faculties by wliicii tliat knowledge can be

acquired. Agreeably with the relations which have been instituted between

our finite faculties and tlic phenomena that affect them, we thus arrive at

demonstrations and convictions which are the most certain that our present

state of being can have or act upon.

   Nor let any one, against whose prepossessions a scientific truth may jar,

confound such demonstrations with the speculative philosophies condemned

by the Apostle ; or ascribe to arrogant intellect soaring to regions of

forbidden mysteries the acquisition of such truths as have been or may

be established by patient and inductive research. For the most part, the

discoverer has been so placed by circumstances, rather than by pre-

determined selection, as to have liis work of investigation allotted to

liim as his daily duty ; in the fulfilment of which he is brought face to

face with phenomena into which he must inquire, and the result of that
inquiry he must faithfully impart. The course of natural as of moral

truth is progressive : but it has pleased the Author of all truth to vary the

fashion of the imparting of such parcels thereof as He has allotted from time

to time, for the l)choof and guidance of mankind.

Those who aje privileged with the faculties of discovery are, therefore, to

1858.                                              d
                                                                               ;

be regarded as preordained instruments in making known the power of God,
without a knowledge of which, as well as of Scripture, we are told that we

shall err.

   Great and marvellous have been the manifestations of this power imparted
to us of late times, not only in respect of the shape, motions, and solar

relations of the earth, but also of its age and inhabitants.

   In regard to the period during which the globe allotted to man has revolved
in its orbit, present evidence strains the mind to grasp such sum of past time

with an effort like that by which it tries to realize the space dividing that

orbit from the fixed stars and remoter nebulae. Yet, during all those aeras
that have passed since the Cambrian rocks were deposited which bear the

impressed record of Creative power, as it was then manifested, we know,

through the interpreters of these ' writings on stone,' that the earth was
vivified by the sun's light and heat, was fertilized by refreshing showers, and

washed by tidal waves.                                         The vast body

   No stagnation has been permitted to air or ocean.

of waters not only moved, as a whole, in orderly oscillations, regulated, as

now, by sun and moon ; but were rippled and agitated by winds and storms.
The atmosphere was healthily influenced by its horizontal currents; and by

ever-varying clouds and vapours, rising, condensing, dissolving, and falling

in endless vertical circulation. With these conditions of life, we know that

life itself has been enjoyed throughout the same countless thousands of years

and that with life, from the beginning, there has been death.

The earliest testimony of the living thing, whether shell, crust, or coral in

the oldest fossiiiferous rock, is at the same time proof that it died.
   At no period has the gift of life been monopolized by a few contemporary

individuals through a stagnant sameness of untold time; but it has been

handed over from generation to generation, and successively enjoyed by the
myriads that constitute the species. And, herein, we discern the greater

beneficence and wisdom ; that, through death, whether sudden or preceded

--by a brief decay, the individual enjoys the varying phases of life, healthy

assimilative growth, active youth, and vigorous maturity, with the procreative

faculties and instincts to boot. And as life rises in the scale, even to the

present highest form, foreknowing of his end, death is still the condition on

--which are enjoyed man's purest pleasures, the reverential love of parents--

--the holy affections of wedlock the fond yearning towards offspring.

It has further been given us to know, that not only the individual but

the species perishes ; that as death is balanced by generation, so extinction
has been concomitant with creative power, which has continued to provide a

succession of species ; and furthermore, that, as regards the varying forms
of life which this planet has witnessed, there has been " an advance and

progress in the main."

Geology demonstrates that the Creative force has not deserted this earth

during any of her epochs of time ; and that in respect to no one class of
ADDRESS.  Ul

 animals has the manifestation of that force been limited to one epoch. Not
 a species offish that now lives, but has come into being during a compara-
 tively recent period : the existing species were preceded by other species, and

 these again by others still more different from the present. No existing genus
 of fishes can be traced back beyond a moiety of known creative time. Two

 entire orders have come into being, and have almost superseded two

 other orders since the newest of the secondary formations of the earth's

  crust.

    The axiom of the continuous operation of Creative power, or of the
 ordained becoming of living things, is here illustrated by the class of fishes,
 because that class is exempt from the application of some exterminating

 causes affecting terrestrial and air-breathing animals.
     But the creation of every class of such animals, whether Reptiles, Birds, or

 Beasts, has been successive and continuous, from the earliest times at which we
 have evidence of their existence. The reptiles of the coal measures, the great
 birds that impressed the Connecticut sandstones, and the marsupial mam-

 mals of the Stonesfield and Purbeck Oolites, came into being long before
 the Cycloid fishes were created and anterior to the apparition of any
 known existing species of aquatic animal. Species after species of land
 animals, order after order of air-breathing reptiles, have succeeded each
 other ; creation ever compensating for extinction. The successive passing
away of air-breathing species may have been as little due to exceptional
violence, and as much to natural law, as in the case of marine plants and
 animals. It is true, indeed, that every part of the earth's surface has been
submerged ; but successively, and for long periods. Of the present dry
 land different natural continents have different faunae and florae ; and the
fossil remains of the plants and animals of these continents respectively
show that they possessed the same peculiar characters, or characteristic
fades, during periods extending far beyond the utmost limits of human

 history.

    Such, gentlemen, is a brief summary of facts most nearly interesting us,
which have been demonstratively made known respecting our earth and its

inhabitants. And when we reflect at how late and in how brief a period of
historical time the acquisition of such knowledge has been permitted, we
must feel that, vast as it seems, it may be but a very small part of the

patrimony of truth destined for the possession of future generations.

     The certain knowledge of the very shape of the earth dates not so far back
by some centuries as that epoch marked by the revelation, amongst other
 divine truths, of the responsibility of man for the use of the talent entrusted
 to him ; and we may well believe that it has been mainly under the sense of
 this responsibility that men have submitted themselves to that patient endu-
 rance of the labour of investigation, experiment, comparison, invention, and

the pondering on results, often to the utmost reach of mental tension, by
which the present knowledge of the Divine power has been acquired.
--lii REPORT 1858.

   In reviewing the nature and results of our proceedings during the last
twenty-seven years, and the aims and objects of our Association, it seems

as if we are realizing the grand Philosophical Dream or Prefigurative Vision
of Francis Bacon, which he has recounted in his ' New Atlantis.'

   In this noble Parable the Father of Modern Science imagines an Institu-
tion which he calls " Solomon's House," and informs us, by the mouth of
one of its members, that " the end of its Foundation is the Knowledge of
Causes and Secret Motions of Things ; and the enlarging of the bounds of

Human Empire to the effecting of all things possible."

    Amongst the means and instruments to this great end, Bacon imagines

laboratories situated at the greatest attainable distances, vertically, in regard

--to the atmosphere ; some sunk 600 fathoms deeper than the deepest natural

cave ; others placed on towers set upon high mountains, " so that the van-
tage of the hill with the tower is in the highest of them three miles at least."
In the depths he conceives might be carried on the producing of new arti-
ficial metals* by compositions and materials left at work for many years, in

imitation of natural mines ; also observations on the formation of figured

fossils ; and he speculates upon the influence of these cold depths in the curing
of certain diseases and the prolonging of human life, as it seems by a super-

induced torpidity. In the higher regions of the air are to be carried on

--observations of the heavens, and of divers meteors wind, rain, hail, and

falling stars.

We" have also," he writes, " spacious houses where we imitate and demon-

Westrate meteors, as thunders, lightnings, snow, hail, and rain.  have, also,

instruments which generate heat only by motion."

 --Next come arrangements for the appliance of water-power and of winds

to set a-going divers motions : "engine-houses, where are prepared engines

and instruments for all sorts of motions, some swifter than any known to the

rest of the world, and other various motions for equality, fineness and subtilty :

--a mathematical house, where are represented all instruments, as well of

Wegeometry as astromomy, exquisitely made.  have also sound-houses, where

we practise and demonstrate all sounds and their generation, as by divers in-

struments of music ; and those that imitate all articulate sounds and letters,

Weand the voices and notes of beasts and birds.  have also the means to convey

sounds in trenches and pipes in strange lines and distances." Then come the

perspective-houses, " where we make demonstrations of all light and radiations

and of all colours; and out of things uncoloured and transparent we can

Werepresent unto you several colours, both as rainbows and as single.  make

artificial rainbows, halos and circles about light, and represent all manner

of reflexions, refractions, and multiplication of visual beams of objects. These

multiplications of light we carry to great distances, and make so sharp as to

Wediscern small points and lines.  procure means of seeing objects afar off,

Weas in the heaven and remote places, representing things afar off as near.

have also glasses and means to see minute bodies perfectly and distinctly,
as the shapes and colours of small flies and worms, which cannot otherwise be
seen ;" also *' observations on blood and sap not otherwise to be seen."

In regard to natural history, Bacon imagines huge Aquaria, of both salt

and fresh water, for the use and observation and generation offish and fowl,

We" where we make trials upon fishes.        have also parks and enclosures of

all sorts of beasts and birds, which we use not only for view and rareness, but
likewise for dissections and trials ; that thereby we may take light wiiat may

be wrought upon the body of man.

We" have also large and various orchards and gai-dens, wherein we do not

so much respect beauty as variety of ground and soil : in these are practised
all conclusions of grafting and inoculating ; and we make, by art, trees and
flowers to come up earlier or later tiian their seasons ; we also make tliem
by art much greater than their nature, and their fruit greater and sweeter,

and of different taste, smell, and colour."

   Lastly, as one important means of effecting the great aims of the "six days-
college," certain of its members were deputed, as " merchants of light," to

make "circuits or visits of divers principal cities of the kingdom."

   This latter feature of the Baconian oi-ganisation is the chief characteristic

of the " British Association ; " but we have striven to carry out other aims

of the ' New Atlantis,' such as the systematic summaries of the results of

different branches of science, of which our published volumes of ' Reports'

are evidence ; and we have likewise realized, in some measure, the idea of
the ' Mathematical House ' in our establishment at Kew.

   The national and private Observatories, the Royal and other Scientific

Societies, the British Museum, the Zoological, Botanical, and Horticultural

Gardens combine in our day to realize that which Bacon foresaw in distant

perspective. Great beyond all anticipation have been the results of this organi-

sation, and of the application of the inductive methods of interrogating Nature.

The universal law of gravitation, the circulation of the blood, the analo-

gous course of the magnetic influence, which may be said to vivify the earth,

permitting no atom of its most solid constituents to stagnate in total rest

the development and progress of Chemistry, Geology, Palaeontology ; the

inventions and practical applications of gas, the steam-engine, photography,

--telegraphy : such, in the few centuries since Bacon wrote, have been the

rewards of the faithful followers of his rules of research.

  We can hardly appreciate the swift of progress of human knowledge unless

we go back, for an instant, to the period whice I have chosen as the starting-

point in this survey.

Bacon's treatment of the Copernican theory shows the importance of pure

observation in the establishment of natural truth, and places in a strong light
the incompetency of the highest intellectual power, of itself, to reason up to
truth, even when it is so plain as it now appears to us in reference to the
true nature of the apparent movements of the sun in respect to the earth.

   The well-known passages from the < Thema Cceli,' and the essay * On the
--liv REPORT 1858.

Cause of the Tides,' together with the fling " at those few carmen which
drive the earth about*," are strongly indicative of the state of Bacon's mind

-- --the philosophical mind of his time on the great question then agitating

it, as to the movements of the heavenly bodies.

  A mass of observations of their apparent movements had been accumula-

tina from the periods of Hipparchiis and Ptolemy to that of Copernicus.
The nature and cause of those observed movements had to be explained.
The Alexandrian astronomer had given an explanation in harmony with the
apparent motions. Copernicus suggested another, contradictory of the ap-
parent motions, but more in harmony, through certain reasons assigned, with
what he believed to be their real nature.

    These reasons wanted proofs from observation ; but the proofs after-
wards came, and were the fruit of the more commonly possessed inventive
faculty rather than of the rarer power of abstract thouglit. Great, truly, is
the gift to mankind when the two faculties coexist in a commanding intellect!

    Galileo invented a perspective glass by which he discovered the four small
bodies which revolve about Jupiter in ditferent periods of time. The analogy
which this visible system of Jupiter bore to the solar system, as conceived by
Copernicus, gave what Herschel calls the "holding turn" to the opinions
of mankind respecting the heliocentric system. Galileo's next discovery

more decidedly confirmed the truth of that system. He observed that Venus

in the course of her revolution assumed the same succession of phases which
our moon exhibits in her monthly circuit. The opponents of Copernicus had
objected that Venus did not appear four times as large as she should do when,

according to his system, she is four times as near us ; but Galileo furnished

the true reason : the dark side of Venus is toward the earth when she is
nearest it. But with all this. Bacon's acceptance of the Copernican system
never went further than as respected the movements of Venus and Mercury

About the Sun.

  My motive in here referring to such trite facts in the History of Astro-

nomy is to impress upon all who sympathize with scientific progress, or

merely wish us ' good speed,' the importance of direct observation of Nature.

The two results of Galileo's direction of his telescope to heavenly bodies
were of more value than the subtlest of the objections of Bacon or of the

excuses of Bruno.

    In 1631 Kepler witnessed the transit of Mercury across the sun's disk: in
1639 Horrox saw the like transit of Venus: and these observations were of
a higher kind than Galileo's. His might be called a chance trial of the phe-
nomena of the skies; the English astronomer planted his telescope at the very
hour, when, according to the Copernican hypothesis, he had calculated that
Venus in her orbit would pass between the sun and the earth. Kepler's
observation of the elliptical form of the orbit of Mars definitely cast out the
eccentrics and epicycles of Ptolemy, and made the Copernican explanation
 easier than it had seemed to Copernicus himself.

The motions of the heavenly bodies being thus determined, there remained

their cause, or their laws. Kepler's successive approximations to an accurate

determination of the orbits of the planets, and to the ratios of their mean

distances from the sun to the times of their revolutions, which mathemati-

cians now express by saying that " the squares of the periodic times are in

the same proportion as the cubes of the distance," became an important

prelude to Newton's discovery of the law of the sun's attractive force.

Without stopping to trace the concurrent progress of the science of mo-

tion, of which the true foundations were laid, in Bacon's time, by Galileo, it

will serve here to state that the foundations were laid and the materials

gathered for the establishment, by a master-mind, supreme in vigour of

thought and mathematical resource, of the grandest generalization ever pro-

--mulgated by science that of the universal gravitation of matter according to

the law of tlie inverse square of the distance.

   The same century in which the ' Thema Coeli' of Lord Verulam and the

' Nuncius Sidereus' of Galileo saw the light, was glorified by the publication

of the ' PhilosophicB Naturalis Principia Matheinatica' of Newton.

   Has time, it may be asked, in any way afl'ected the great result of that
masterpiece of human intellect ? There are signs that even Newton's axiom,
or the terms in which it was enunciated, may not be exempt from the restless

law of progress.

The mode of expressing the law of gravitation as being " in the inverse

proportion of the square of the distances," involves the idea that the force

emanating from or exercised by the sun must become more feeble in pro-

portion to the increased spherical surface over which it is diffused. So, in-

deed, it was expressly understood by Halley.

   The ablest historian of Natural Science has remarked that " future dis-
coveries may make gravitation a case of some wider law, and may disclose
something of the mode in which it operates*." The difficulty, indeed, of

conceiving a force acting through nothing from body to body has of late

made itself felt ; and more especially since Meyer of Heilbron first clearly

expressed the principle of the ' conservation of force.' Newton, though
apprehending the necessity of a medium by which the force of gravitation

should be conveyed from one body to anotherf, yet appears not to have

possessed such an idea of the indestructibility of force as that which, now

possessed by minds of the highest order, seems to some of them to be in-
compatible with the terms in which Newton enunciated his great law ; viz.

of matter attracting matter with a force which varies inversely as the square

of the distance.

Faraday has offered the following comment on this received expression
-- Aof the idea of gravity: "Assume two particles of matter,
                                                                 and B,

towards each other, the force being unalterable for an unchanging dis-

tance, but varying inversely as the square of the distance, when the
latter varies. Then, at the distance of 10 the force may be estimated

as 1 ; whilst at the distance of 1, i. e. one-tenth of the former, the

force will be 100 : and if we suppose an elastic spring to be introduced

between the two as a measure of the attractive force, the power com-

pressing it will be a hundred times as much in the latter case as in the
former. But from whence can this enormous increase of the power come ?

If we say that it is the character of this force, and content ourselves with

that as a sufficient answer, then, it appears to me, we admit a creation

of power, and that to  an enormous  amount                                yet  by a  change  of condition,
                                                                       ;

so small and simple as to fail in leading the least-instructed mind to think

that it can be a sufficient cause, we should admit a result which would

equal the highest act our minds can appreciate of the working of infinite

power upon matter; we should let loose the highest law in physical science

which our faculties permit us to perceive, namely, the conservation offorce.

ASuppose the two particles and B removed back to the greater distance of

10, then the force of attraction would be only a iiundrcdth part of that they

previously possessed ; this, according to the statement that the force varies

inversely as the square of the distance, would double the strangeness of the

above results ; it would be an annihilation of force : an effect equal in its

affinity and its consequences with creation, and only within the power of Him

who has created."

If we suppose the different modes of force, which we call 'light,' 'heat,'

' gravity,' to act in all directions, as emanations from a centre, with a force

which is the same in every part of the line, throughout space, the law of the

' inverse squares ' would be a necessary consequence of the fact tliat, at double

the distance, only one-fourth the number of such ' lines of force ' would im-

pinge or act upon the ' illuminated,' ' heated ' or 'attracted ' body *.

This may be understood by the subjoined diagram :

So much in illustration of the present phase of scientific thought in refer-

ence to the Newtonian axiom.
   The progress of knowledge of the form of all-pervading force, which

we call, from its most notable effect on one of the senses, 'light,' has not

been less remarkable than that of gravitation.

   Galileo's discovery of Jupiter's satellites supplied Romer with the pheno-
mena whence he was able to measure, in 1676, the velocity of light. Des-

cartes, in his theory of the Rainbow, referred the different colours to the

different amount of refraction, and made a near approximation to Newton's

capital discovery of the different colours entering into the composition of the

luminous ray, and of their different refrangibility. Hook and Huyghens,

about the same period had entered upon explanations of the phenomena of
light conceived as due to the undulations of an ether, propagated from the
luminous point spherically, like those of sound. Newton, whilst admitting
that such undulations or vibrations of an ether would explain certain phe-
nomena, adopted the hypothesis of emission as most convenient for the
mathematical propositions relative to light. The discoveries of achromatism,
of the laws of double refraction, of polarization circular and elliptical, and
of depolarization, rapidly followed, realizing more than Bacon conceived
might flow from the labours of the 'perspective house,' and, with later ad-
vances in optics, have made renowned the names of DoUond, Young, Malus,
Fresnel, Arago, Biot, Brewster, Stokes, and Jamin.

   Some of the natural sciences, as we now comprehend them, had not ger-
minated in Bacon's time. Chemistry was then Alchemy : Geology and Pa-

lasontology were undreamt of: but Magnetism and Electricity had begun to
be observed, and their phenomena compared and defined by a contem-
porary of Bacon, in a way that claims to be regarded as the first step toward a
scientific knowledge of those powers. It is true that, before Gilbert*, the
magnet was known to attract iron, and the great practical application of

-- --magnetized iron the mariner's compass had been invented, and for many

years before Bacon's time had guided the barks of navigators through track-

less seas.

Gilbert, to whom the name ' electricity ' is due, observed that that force

attracted light bodies, whereas the magnetic force attracted iron only.

About a century later the phenomena of repulsion as well as of

attraction of light bodies by electric  substances  were  noticed                                   and  Dufay,
                                                                                                 ;

in 1733, enunciated the principle that "electric bodies attract all those that

are not so, and repel them as soon as they are become electric by the

vicinity of the electric body."

   The conduction of electric force, and the different behaviour of bodies in

contact with the electric, leading to their division, by Desaguliers, into con-

ductors and non-conductors, next followed. The two kinds of electricity, at
first by Dufay, their definer, called ' vitreous ' and ' resinous,' afterwards, by

Franklin, * positive ' and ' negative,' formed an important step, which led to a
brilliant series of experiments and discoveries, with inventions, such as the
Leyden jar, for intensifying the electric shock. But whilst the majority of the
applications of these degrees of mastery over the electric force was calculated
to amuse or surprise, the instantaneous transmission of electricity through an
extent of 6000 feet, demonstrated by Sir W.Watson, together with Franklin's
discovery of the electric state of the clouds, and of the power of drawing
off such electricity by pointed bodies, was a brilliant beginning of the appli-
cation of this subtle sci-enee to the discovery of the well-being and needs of
mankind. Superstitious ignorance might well shrink from playing, as the
American philosopher with his electric kites seemed to be doing, with light-

--ning, might gaze with alarm at the Russian Professor * collecting on his elec-

--trical rod the awful charge of the black thunder-cloud, might deem the

globe of fire which leapt from the rod upon the head of the experimenter
and struck him dead as a judgment for tampering with a force that man's
instinct, in all ages, has referred to a direct expression of the power and
will of Deity. But the cultivator of God's intellectual gifts sees rather,
in the application of the lightning-conductors which now guide harmless to
the earth the dangerous electricity of the clouds, the predestined fruit and
reward of the laborious and dauntless application of those gifts, agreeably

with the rule of right reason, to the unfolding of natural phenomena.

   To hide from the lightning and tremble at the thunder, as the immediate

manifestation of offended Deity, is the superstition of the savage : to recog-

nize that both phenomena are under the control of a law, and operating to
beneficial ends, is the privilege of the sage. This it is which begets a true
and worthy feeling of reverence for the Lawgiver.

   When the knowledge of the law gives the mode of diverting from the

well-manned ship and the crowded hall the destructive influence of the
electric bolt, we then worthily adore the beneficence that has imparted so

much of the power-interpreting talent as brings that reward for its enjoined
use. The philosopher, in the course of his hazardous experimental
researches, may incur a fatal result ; but he becomes then, not the sacrifice

for presumptuous espial into divine and forbidden mysteries, but the true
· martyr of science.' His death has contributed to save the lives of thousands
of his fellow- creatures and to allay the distressing fears of millions.

  --Magnetism has been studied with two aims, the one to note the numerical

relations of its activity to time and space, both in respect of its direction and
intensity, the other to penetrate the mystery of the nature of the magnetic

force.

   In reference to the first aim, my estimable predecessor adverted, last year,

to the fact that it was in the Committee-rooms of the British Association
that the first step was taken towards that great magnetic organization which

has since borne so much fruit. Thereby it has been determined that there

ADDRESS.                                                                 lix

are periodical changes of the magnetic elements depending on the hour of

the day, the season of the year, and on what seemed strange intervals of

about eleven years. Also, that besides these regular changes there were

--others of a more abrupt and seemingly irregular character Humboldt's
--' magnetic storms ' which occur simultaneously at distant parts of the

earth's surface. Major-General Sabine, than whom no individual has done

more in this field of research since Halley first attempted " to explain the

change in the variation of the magnetic needle," has proved that the magnetic

storms observe diurnal, annual, and decennial periods. But with

what phase or phenomenon of earthly or heavenly bodies, it may be asked,

has the magnetic period of ten years to do? The coincidence which

points to, if it does not give, the answer, is one of the most remarkable, un-

expected, and encouraging to patient observers.

For thirty years a German astronomer, Schwabe, had set himself the task

of daily observing and recording the appearance of the sun's disk ; in which

time ho found that the spots passed through periodic phases of increase and

Adecrease, the length of the period being about ten years.  comparison

of the independent evidence of the astronomer and magnetic observer has

shown that the decennial magnetic period coincides both in its duration

and in its epochs of maximum and minimum with the same period observed

in the solar spots.

  A few weeks ago, during a visit of inspection to our establishment at Kew,

I observed the successful operation of the photoheliographic apparatus in

depicting the solar spots as they then appeared. The continued regular

record of the macular state of the sun's surface, with the concurrent magnetic

observations now established over many distant points of the earth's surface,

will ere long establish the full significance and value of the remarkable, and,

in reference to the observers, undesigned, coincidence above mentioned.

Not to trespass on your patience by tracing the progress of magnetism

I'rom Gilbert to Oersted, I cannot but advert to the time, 1807, when the

latter tried to discover whether electricity in its most latent state had any

effect on the magnet, and to his great result, in 1820, that the conducting-

wire of a voltaic circuit acts upon a magnetic needle, so that the latter tends

to place itself at right angles to the wire.

The ablest physicists in Europe, and Ampere especially, devoted them-

selves, immediately on the promulgation of this capital discovery, to the

analysis of its conditions. Ampere, moreover, succeeded, by means of a

delicate apparatus, in demonstrating that the voltaic wire was affected by the

action of the earth itself as a magnet. In short, the generalization was esta-

blished, that magnetism and electricity are but different effects of one common

--cause. This has proved the first step to still grander abstractions to that

which conceives the reduction of all the species of imponderable fluids of

the chemistry of our student days, together with gravitation, chemicity*,

and neuricity*, to interchangeable modes of action of one and the same

all-pervading life-essence.
    Galvaui arranged the parts of a recently-mutilated frog so as to bring a

nerve in contact with the external surlace of a muscle, when a contraction

of the muscle ensued. In this suggestive experiment the Italian philosopher,
·who thereby initiated the inductive inquiry into the relation of nerve force
to electric force, concluded that the contraction was a necessary conse-
quence of the passage of electricity from one surface to the other by means

of the nerve. He supposed that the electricity was secreted by the brain,

and transmitted by the nerves to different parts of the body, the muscles
serving as reservoirs of the electricity. Volta made a further step, by show-
ino- that, under the conditions or arrangements of Galvani's experiments, the
muscle would contract, whether the electric current had its origin in the
animal body, or from a source external to that body. Galvani erred in
too exclusive a reference of the electric force producing the contraction
to the brain of the animal : Volta in excluding the origin of the electric force

from the animal body altogether. The determination of ' the true' and ' tiic
constant' in tliese recondite phaenomena has been mainly helped on by the

persevering and ingenious experimental researches of Matteucci and Du

Bois Reyniond. The latter has shown that any point of the surface of a

muscle is positive in relation to any point of the divided or transverse section
of the same muscle ; and that any point of the surface of a nerve is positive
in relation to any point of the divided or transverse section of the same nerve.
Mr. Baxter, in still more recent researches, has deduced important conclu-
sions on the origin of the muscular and nerve currents, as being due to the
polarized condition of the nerve or muscular fibre, and the relation of that

condition to changes which occur during nutrition. From the present state
of neuro-electricity it may be concluded that nerve force is not identical with
electric force, but that it may be another mode of motion of the same com-
mon force : it is certainly a polar force, and perhaps the highest form of

polar force :

               " A motion which may change, but cannot die
                 An image of some bright eternity."

   The present tendency of the higher generalizations of chemistry seems to
be toward a reduction of the number of those bodies which are called

' elementary ; ' it begins to be suspected that certain groups of so-called

chemical elements are but modified forms of one another.

   An important step in the elimination of the chlorine and bromine group

from the category of simple bodies or elements has very recently been made
by Prof. Schonbein. He, at least, adduces strong reasons, from analogy,
for regarding those substances as 'oxy-compounds,' or what the Professor

terms ' Ozonides ;' chlorine being, according to this view, the peroxide of

murium=MuO-|-0. The researches on which this conclusion is founded
have recalled to my mind the cautious terms in which my venerable Teacher

of Chemistry, Hope, always introduced Davy's then new hypothesis ; and
I now better appreciate the celebrated Edinburgh Professor's disinclination
to abandon the old doctrine of the compound nature of chlorine, &c.

    Organic chemistry becomes simplified as it expands; and its growth has,
of late, proceeded, through the labours of Hoffmann, Berthelot, and others,

with unexampled rapidity. The results of the recent experiments of M. Ber-

thelot have more especially tended to reduce the various and numerous
ternary oxygenated organic substances into a small number of fundamental
groups. Tlie important power of synthesis has grown with this growth.
Since Wohler, in 1828, succeeded in artificially producing ' urea,' Kolbe
has similarly, by the combinations of inorganic elements, produced acetic
acid and the new organic radical ' methyl.' Berthelot has formed glycerine,
the basis of animal and vegatable oils and fats, and has also formed grape-
sugar. It is true, that in the latter synthesis the contact of putrefying animal
matter is requisite ; although such matter contributes none of its constituents
to the new compound, nor undergoes any appreciable change in the process.
Berthelot has very recently shown that cholesterine is a true alcohol, analo-
gous to ethal ; and that, treated by acids, it is transformed into corresponding

ethers, similar to other ethilic ethers.

  A substance resembling camphor has been this year made by the action of

acids, e.g., the chorhydric, upon essential oil of turpentine. By treating this

substance with strong alkali it is changed into a liquid carburet of hydrogen ;
but, if feeble alkalis are employed or slightly alkaline salts, a solid carburet

is obtained identical with camphor. By oxidizing the artificial camphor,
ordinary camphor is obtained; by adding hydrgoen to such ordinary cam-
phor, the camphor of Borneo is obtained. M. Berthelot has thus realized

the synthetic preparation of camphors.

   An important series of alcohols and their derivatives, from amylic alcohol

downwards; as extensive a series of ethers, including those which give their

peculiar flavour to our choicest fruits ; the formic, butyric, succinic, lactic,

and other acids, together with other important organic bodies, are now

capable of artificial formation from their elements, and the old barrier divi-

ding organic from inorganic bodies is broken down. To the power which
mankind may ultimately exercise through the light of synthesis, who may
])resume to set limits ! Already natural processes can be more economically

replaced by artificial ones in the formation of a few oi'ganic compounds, the
< valerianic acid,' for example. It is impossible to foresee the extent to

which Chemistry may not ultimatelj-, in the production of things needful,
supersede the present vital agencies of nature "by laying under conti'ibution

the accumulated forces of past ages, which would thus enable us to obtain in
a small manufactory, and in a few days, effects which can be realized from
present natural agencies, only when they are exerted upon vast areas of
land, and through considerable periods of time*."

--Ixii REPORT 1858.

Since Niepce, Herschel, Fox Talbot, and Daguerre laid the foundations

of Photography, year by year some improvement is made, some advance

achieved, in this most subtle application and combination of discoveries in

Photicity, Electricity, Chemistry, and Magnetism.

Last year M. Poiteven's production of plates in relief, for the purpose of

engraving by the action of light alone, was cited as the latest marvel of

photography. This year has witnessed photographic printing in carbon.

M. Pretschi's method is as follows :

  A" photograph or engraving is placed on the prepared plate, and a nega-

tive taken in sun-light. The glass is then placed in water with a little

alcohol, and the darkened parts are rendered soluble, while the other parts

are insoluble, so tiiat in a few minutes we have a picture represented not

only by light and shadow, but by the unequal thickness of the gelatine on

the glass. When the plate is dry, soft gutta-percha is pressed upon the

picture till it hardens. The gutta-percha has consequently an image the

reverse of the first. After rubbing it over with bronze powder or black-

lead, it is placed in a solution of sulphate of copper, and an electrotype plate

taken from it, in the usual way, with a voltaic battery. From this plate

others can be readily taken, and, as in ordinary copperplate printing, thou-

sands of copies can be thrown off. ' By this process,' says Mr. Hunt, ' pic-

tures, in which the most delicate details are very faithfully preserved, and

the nice gradations in light and shadow maintained in all their beauty, are
now printed from the electrotype plate, obtained from the photograph. The

process of photo-galvanography is evidently destined to take a very high
position as a means of preserving the beauties of nature and art.' "

   M. Niepce de St. Victor has succeeded in reproducing the colour of the

original on metallic plates; though he cannot fix it. Unfortunately these

lovely ' heliochromes ' vanish like the breath from the mirror.

   M. Delarue has obtained photographs of the moon in which the details of

--its illuminated surface are well defined the cone in ' Tycho,' the double

Acone in ' Copernicus,' and even the ridge of ' Aristarchus.'    photograph

of the planet Jupiter has been obtained in which the belts are very well
marked and the satellites distinct.

   The portrait of a 13-inch shell has been secured while in full flight, a few

feet after it left the mortar ; and, in effecting this, Mr. Scaife has obtained
a representation of phenomena in the development of the smoke too trans-

itory for the eye to ascertain when they occur. The photographic eye is, in
fact, more sensitive than the living one : it can receive and register impres-
sions too fine for human vision, until made visible by increased light and

developing agents. Hence, photography may superadd a new defining func-

tion to the highest attainable telescopic power.

   Photography is now a constant and indispensable servant in certain im-

portant meteorological records. Applied periodically to living plants, photo-

graphy supplies the botanist with the easiest and best data for judging of

their rate of growth. It gives to the zoologist accurate representations of
the most complex of his subjects, and of their organization, even to micro-

scopic details.

   The engineer at home can ascertain by photographs transmitted by suc-
cessive mails the weekly progress, brick by brick, board by board, nail by

uail, of the most complex works on the Indian or other remote rail-roads.
The physician can register every physiognomic phase accompanying the
access, height, decrease, and passing away of mental disease.

   The humblest emigrant may carry with him miniatures, such as Dow could

not have equalled in the perfection of their finish, of scenes and persons
which will recall and revive the dearest affections of the home he has left.

   In its lowest application photography becomes an instrument of the

   The first practical application of the electro- magnetic discovery was, as it
should be, to the direct service of the philosophic inquirer : it was such an
application of a delicate compass-needle as would show, by its deflection,
the strength of the voltaic current. The possession of Schweigger's ' gal-
vanometer ' enabled the philosopher henceforth to detect and measure the
minutest electro-dynamic actions. It led to the discovery by Seebeck

of the conversion of heat into that kind of action ; in short, of thermo-

electricity.

 -- --On Faraday's demonstration the converse of Oersted's that magnetism

could produce electricity, and on the brilliant series of discoveries of that
most exemplary investigator of natural laws, I need not dwell, in the pre-

sence of so many who are better qualified than myself to comprehend and

illustrate them.

   Remote as such profound conceptions and subtle trains of thought seem
to be from the needs of every-day life, the most astounding of the practical
augmentations of man's power has sprung out of them. Nothing might
seem less promising of profit than Oersted's painfully-pursued experiments,
with his little magnets, voltaic pile, and bits of copper-wire. Yet out of
these has come the electric telegraph ! Oersted himself saw such an appli-
cation of his convertibility of electricity into magnetism; and Schilling suc-
cessfully applied the principle to the instantaneous communication of signs
through distances of a few miles. The unrivalled resources of Wheat-
stone's inventive genius have made it practicable for all distances, as we
have lately seen in the submergence and working of the electro-magnetic

cord connecting the Old with the New World.

   Whoever has been engaged in the delicate physical and chemical expe-
riments required in the present state of natural philosophy, will know how
small is the expectation of success on the first trial of a new experiment in
the laboratory. Only the experienced manipulator realizes how hard it is to
foresee every condition requisite for success : but it is he who bears the

the conditions of success, find that every cause of failure, well ascertained,

is an encouragement to the repetition of tiie trial. Every practical phy-

sicist, therefore, was prepared to expect a certain number of instructive

failures in the attempt to carry out the grandest philosophical experiment

--on record the most stupendous which mortal mind ever ventured to pro-

--pose to itself. Our surprise is, that the failures were so few, the success

so speedy. But the persevering and determined men who achieved this

success, temporary as it has been, were animated by the spirit in which Lord

--Bacon tells us experimental philosophy should be entered upon : " For

there is no comparison," he writes, " between that which we may lose by

not trying and by not succeeding ; since by not trying we throw away the

chance of an immense good, by not succeeding we only incur the loss of a

little human labour.'

   On the 6th of August, 1858, the laying down of upwards of 2000 nautical

miles of the telegraphic cord, connecting Newfoundland and Ireland, was

successfully  completed                                               and  shortly  after,  a  message  of thirty-one  words  was
                                                                   ;

transmitted in thirty-five minutes along the sinuosities of the submerged hills

and valleys forming the bed of the great Atlantic. This first message

ended by expressing "Glory to God in the highest: on Earth

Peace, Goodwill towards Men." Never since the foundations of the

world were laid could it be more truly said, " The depths of the sea praise

Him !

More remains to be done before the far-stretching, thought-bearing engine

can be got into full working order; but the capital fact, viz., the practica-

bility of bringing America into electrical communication with Europe has

been demonstrated ; consequently a like power of instantaneous interchange

of thought between the civilized inhabitants of every part of the globe

becomes only a question of time. The powers and benefits thence to ensue

for the human race can be but dimly and inadequately foreseen. Some

results stand out more prominently than others.

The investigator of natural laws manifests his success by the degree in

which he elicits and substitutes latent natural force for manual labour in effect-

ing his purpose. Sennacherib, as we see on the slabs from Niiievch, added the

lever to traction in the transport of the colossal symbolic statues of his majesty;

but the power by which he worked both mechanical adjustments was slaves

stimulated by the stick. Hundreds of human beings were sacrificed in the

Wattoperation.  achieved an equal effect by the scientific eduction and

direction of the latent force contained in a few pounds of coal.

    If this test be applied to the present state of the science of governing

peoples, it would seem to show but little progress therein. The conscription

committee of France for 1858 proposed a levy of 100,000 men, because

less would not suffice to keep up the requisite army of 500,000 men
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

   The probability of a furtlicr augmentation of the military force of the

Federal Government, in reference to a possil^le rupture with the Mother-

country, must be greatly diminished by an ocean telegraph. And we may

confidently hope that this and other applications of pure science will tend to

abolish wars over the whole earth ; so that men may come to look back

Bacon, commenting on the History of the Works of Nature, as it presented

itself to him, describes it as a chaos "of fables, antiquities, quotations,

frivolous disputes, philology, ornaments, and table-talk." Since his day the

chief steps, by which Natural History has advanced to the dignity of a

science, are associated with the names of Ray, Linnaeus, Jussieu, Buffon, and

Cuvier.

   By the two former the phenomena were digested and classified, according

to artificial but conveniently applicable methods ; of necessity tlie precursors
of systems more expressive of the natural affinities of plants and animals.

   To perfect the natural system of plants has been the great aim of botanists
since Jussieu. To obtain the same true insight into the relations of animals
has stimulated the labours of zoologists since the writings of Cuvier. To

tiiat great man appertains the merit of having systematically pursued and

applied anatomical researches to the discovery of the true system of distri-

bution of the animal kingdom : nor, until the Cuvierian amount of zootomical

science had been gained, could the value and importance of Aristotle's

* History of Animals ' be appreciated. The Greek philosopher, in this de-

partment of science, had advanced far beyond his systematic depreciator,

Bacon, who could not, in fact, in the then state of natural knowledge, com-

prehend his discoveries. Such was the low state of Zoology in the in-

terval between Aristotle and Cuvier, that there is no similar instance, in
the history of science, of the well-lit torch gradually growing dimmer and

smouldering through so many generations and centuries before it was again

fanned into brightness, and a clear view regained, both of the extent of

ancient discovery, and of the true course to be pursued by modern research.

Rapid and right has been the progress of Zoology since that resumption.

   Not only has the structure of the animal been investigated, even to the
minute characteristics of each tissue, but the mode of formation of such
constituents of organs, and of the organs themselves, has been pursued from

the germ, bud, or egg, onward to the maturity and decay of the individual.

   To the observation of outward ciiaracters is now added that of inward
organization and developmental change, and Zootomy, Histology, and Em-

bryology combine their results in forming an adequate and lasting basis for

the higlier axioms and generalizations of Zoology properly so called.

   Three principles, of the common ground of which we may ultimately
obtain a clearer insight, are now recognized to have governed the construc-

--tion of animals : unity of plan, vegetative repetition, and fitness for purpose.

The last, alone, has of late been questioned : but, in reference to such struc-
tures as are exemplified by the flood-gates of the heart and the lens of the

eye, I find my own powers of conception and expression such as to leave me

no other mode of understanding myself, or of being intelligible to others,
than by using the terms ' aim,' ' end,' ' purpose,' or ' design,' in regard to the

relation of the first instanced structure to the course of the blood in the
circulatory system ; and of the second to the convergence of light in the act

of vision.

    The independent series of researches by which students of the Articulate

animals liave seen, in the organs performing the functions of jaws and limbs
of varied powers, the same or homotypal elements of a series of like seg-
ments constituting the entire body, and by which students of the Vertebrate
animals have been led to the conclusion that the maxillary, mandibular,
nyoid, scapular, costal and pelvic arches, and their appendages sometimes
 forming limbs of varied power:*, are also modified elements of a series of

--essentially similar vertebral segments, mutually corroborate their respective

conclusions. It is not probable that a principle which is true for Artivulata
should be false for Vertebrata : the less probable, since the determination of
homologous parts becomes the more possible and sure in the ratio of the

 perfection of the organization.

    The last proposition may be tested by a study of any single set of organs

with a view to determine their homologies.
    Take, for instance, the teeth, or the organs properly so called, which are

peculiar to the vertebrate animals. One cannot trace any particular tooth,
as one may a bone, from Fish to Fish : they are too numerous and too uni-
form. In Reptiles we may point to the maxillary poison-tooth of a Rattle-

snake as answering to that in a Cobra; the homological relations of the
 teeth being only predicable in a general way, as premaxillary, maxillary,

mandibular, palatine, in the rest of that class. But when we come to the
 Mammalia, we find, save in a few inferior groups resembling fishes (e. g.

 Cetaced) or resembling reptiles (Bruta), that the teeth have such deter-
 minate characters, from relative position and development, as to enable the
 anatomist to trace each individual tooth from species to species, and indicate
 it, throughout that large proportion of the class which has been called

 ' diphyodont,' by a determinate name and symbol.

    And here I would repeat, what I have elsewhere expressed, that each year's

 experience strengthens the conviction that the right and quick progress of the
 knowledge of animal structures, and of the axioms deducible therefrom, will
 be mainly influenced by the determination of homologies and by the conco-
 mitant power of condensing the propositions relating to homologized parts,
 by means of definite single substantive names, and their equivalent signs or
 symbols.

    In my work on the * Archetype of the Skeleton,' I have denoted most of the
ADDRESS.  IXvii

bones by numerals, which, when adopted, may take the place of names ; for

then all propositions respecting the centrum of the occipital vertebra might
be predicated of ' 1 ' as intelligibly as of ' basioccipital.' The name appears

to be now generally accepted, and why not the symbol ? The symbols of

the teeth are as definite as those of the bones; and, in the absence of single

names, more useful, since they render unnecessary the repetition of the com-
pound definitions ; they harmonize conflicting synonyms, serve as a universal
language, and express the writer's meaning in the fewest and clearest terms.
The entomologist has realized the advantage of signs, such as c?, ?, &c. for
male, female, neuter, and the like ; and the time is come when the anatomist

may avail himself of this powerful instrument of thought, instruction, and

discovery, from which the chemist, the astronomer, and the mathematician
have obtained such important results.

   To William Sharp Macleay, author of the ' Horse Entomologicae,' belongs

the meritof first clearly defining and exemplifying, in regard to the similarities
observable between different animals, the distinction between those that in-
dicate 'aflSnity' and those that indicate 'analogy' or representation. This
distinction has been well illustrated by Vigors in the class of Birds, and has
been ably discussed by Swainson in reference to other classes of animals.

    ' Affinity,' as first defined by Macleay in contradistinction from ' analogy,'
signifies the relationship which one animal bears to another in its struc-
ture, and is the closer as the similarity of structure is greater. Swainson
illustrates this idea by comparing a goatsucker with a swallow and with a
bat : with the one its relation is intimate, with the other remote : the goat-
sucker has affinity with the swallow, analogy to the bat.

    But the idea of the foregoing intimate relation of entire animals, called
' affinity,' is different from the idea of the answerable relation of parts of
animals called ' homology.' Animals, however intimately ' aflSned,' are never
the same in the sense in which homologous parts are so esteemed : they
could never be called by the same name, in the way or sense in which a bone,
for example, of the fore-limb, is called ' humerus ' in the goatsucker, swalloM',
and bat.

    There is, indeed, a sameness in the idea of * analogy,' as applied by the
Zoologist to animals, and by the Anatomist to their parts. The goatsucker is
related by analogy to a bat, because, as Mr. Swainson remarks, " it flies at the
same hour of the day, and feeds in the same manner; " and the membranous
wingof the bat isanalogousto the membranous parachute of the dragon, because

--it serves to sustain the body in the air. That is to say, ' function ' a similar
-- --relationship to a tertium quid in the above instance air, is the groundwork

for predicating analogies in regard to parts as well as wholes ; more espe-
cially when, as in the case of the wings of the dragon and bat, they are not
homologous parts.

  --The study of homologous parts in a single system of organs the bones
--has mainly led to the recognition of the plan or archetype of the highest

                                                                                  e2

primary group of animals, the Vertebrata. The next step of importance will

be to determine the homologous parts of the nervous system, of the muscular

system, of the respiratory and vascular system, and of the digestive, secre-

tory, and generative organs in the same primary group or province, I think

it of more importance to settle the homologies of the parts of a group of

animals constructed on the same general plan, than to speculate on such re-

lations of parts in animals constructed on demonstratively distinct plans of

organization. What has been effected and recommended, in regard to homo-

logous parts in the Vertebrata, should be followed out in the Articulata and

Molhisca.

In regard to the constituents of the crust or outer skeleton and its append-

ages in the Articulata, homological relations have been studied and deter-

mined to a praiseworthy extent, throughout that province.

   The same study is making progress in the Mollusca ; but the grounds for
determining special homologies are less sure in this subkingdom. The

vegetative functions here predominate; and just as the organs of these func-

tions are less satisfactory subjects of homological determination than those of

the animal functions in the Vertebrate province, so the Molluscous province

is a less favourable field for homological demonstrations than either the

Articulate or Vertebrate provinces, in which the animal functions predomi-

nate over the vegetative.

So far as homologies can be determined, within the limits in which such

determination can be most satisfactorily carried out, the foundation will be

securely laid for a superstructure of higiier generalizations in regard to parts

homological or answerable throughout the animal kingdom generally.

The present state of homology in regard to the Articulata has sufficed

to demonstrate that the segment of the crust is not a hollow expanded homo-

logue of the segment of the endoskeleton of a vertebrate. There is as little

homology between the parts and appendages of the segments of the Verte-

brate and Articulate skeletons respectively. The parts called mandibles,

maxillae, arms, legs, wings, fins, in Insects and Crustaceans, are only ' analo-
gous ' to the parts so called in Vertebrates.

   To express finitely the clear deideas now possessed of their essential di-
stinction, will require a distinct nomenclature. The same remark is appli-

cable to other systems of organs. The so-called 'lungs' of the spider are

analogous to, not homologous with, our 'lungs : ' the tracheae of insects are

not homologous with the bird's trachea and its ramifications : the gills of

the lobster are not the homologous parts of the gills of fishes. No compara-

tive anatomist now supposes that the heart of the lobster is homologous with

that of a fish : or either of these organs with the heart of a snail. The name

in each group is simply expressive of similarity of function, and of connexions

limited by and solely related to such function, as of the heart with a vein

Aand an artery.  most extensive field of reform is becoming open to the

nienclature equivalent to express his convictions of the different relations of

similitude. Most difficult and recondite are the questions in face of which
the march of homology is now irresistibly conducting the philosophic observer.

--Such, for instance, as the following: Are the nervous, muscular, digestive,

circulating and generative systems of organs more than functionally similar
in any two primary provinces of the animal kingdom ? Are the homologies
of entire systems to be judged of by their functional and structural con-
nexions, rather than by the plan and course of their formation in the
embryo ?

    In the development of animals the vitellus is observed to have different
relations to the embryo. But such difference is not always or absolutely
associated with a difference of plan of structure : the Cephalopods show a
higher development of the same fundamental plan of structure as that of the
Gasteropods, but the vitelline phenomena of their development resemble
those of Vertebrata, not those of Gasteropoda.

    Even in the last-named restricted molluscous group there are striking
differences in the vitelline relations of the embryo. In most the embryo
early encloses the vitelline mass; in some, as in Limax, much later: and
there is what may be termed a temporary vitelline sac.

    The yolk undergoes a complete segmentation in placental Mammals, the
embryo of which is formed out of the whole vitelline mass, as it is in the
whelk, the oyster and the star-fish. The bird, the crocodile and the cuttle-
fish resemble each other in the embryo rising out of the yolk, assimilating

only a portion, and leaving the rest as an appendage until the period of birth,
or lor a short time after.

   It may be doubted, therefore, if embryology alone is decisive of the

question whether homology can be predicated of the alimentary canal in
animals of different primary groups or provinces. The armadillo (Das?/pus)
and the woodlouse (^0?iiscus) are good subjects for illustrating this question.
In both, the alimentary canal begins at the fore part and terminates at the
hind part of the body : in both, an oesophagus precedes a stomach, as this

precedes the part of the canal receiving the biliary secretion ; in both, the in-
 testine follows to terminate at the vent.

    Besides the sameness of function, the homologist, confiding in the
characters of connexion and relative position, would retain the names ' ali-
mentary canal,' ' mouth,' ' gullet,' ' stomach,' ' gut,' to express his ideas of
the veritable answerable character of the parts compared in Oniscus and

Dasypus: but he who believes embryology alone capable of affording a solid

 basis for determining homologies*, will infer that the different relations of
 the yolk and the intestine in the embryos of the vertebrate and articulate

    * " Embryology affords further a test for homologies in contradistinction to analo-
 gies. It shows that true homologies are limited respectively within the natural boundaries

  animals*, establish that the 30-calied alimentary canal is an essentially differ-

 ent part in the mammal and the insect.
     The almost annular ossified segments of the skin of the armadillo, arranged

 so as to overlap and allow the body to be contracted into a ball, are, on the
 basis of connexions and relative position, homologous with the almost annu-

 lar chitinous segments of the skin of the wood-louse, which present the same
 arrangement for permitting that insect to roll itself into a ball. But, accord-

 ing to tlie embryological basis, there can be no true homology betM'een the
 parts compared; this relation being limited respectively within the natural

 boundaries of the great branches of the animal kingdom.

    The zoologist may learn from the above instances the phase at which the
 philosophical study and comparison of animal structures has now arrived,

 and I shall not pursue the disquisition further on the present occasion.
     It is significant, however, of the lower value of embryological characters, to

 note that the great leading divisions of the animal kingdom, based by Cuvier

 on comparative anatomy, have mei-ely been confirmed by Von Baer's later
 developmental researches. And so, likewise, with regard to some of the

 minor modifications of Cuvier's provinces, the true position of the Cirripedia
 was discerned by Straus Durkheim and Macleay, by the light of anutomy,
 before the discovery of their metamorphoses by Thomson.

    If, however, embryology has been over-valued as a test of homology, the
study of the development of animals has brought to light most singular and

interesting facts, and I now allude more especially to those that have been
summed up under the term ' Alternate-generation,' ' Parthenogenesis,'

' Metagenesis,' &c.

   John Hunter first enunciated the general proposition (many of the facts

being known long before his time), that " the propagation of plants depended
on two principles, tlie one that every part of a vegetable is ' a whole,' so that

it is capable of being multiplied as far as it can be divided into distinct
parts ; the other, that certain of those parts become reproductive organs, and
produce fertile seeds." Hunter also remarked that " the first principle ope-

rated in many animals which propagate their species by buds or cuttings ; "
but that, whilst in animals, it prevailed only in " the more imperfect orders,"

it operated in vegetables " of every degree of perfection." He suggestively

remarks, however, that "those degrees are few in comparison with the
'animal,' and that the least perfect ' animal' is probably on a par with the
most perfect ' vegetablef.'" Subsequent progress has shown that what

seemed 'probable' when Hunter wrote is not exactly true. The special
conditions of organisms or living things, which we call 'vegetable' and

'animal,' rise by degrees and diverge from a general organic character or

* " The alimentary canal is formed in a very different way in the embryos of the two

types                      and it would  be as unnatural  to identify them, as  it would  be still  to consider gills
                        ;

and lungs as homologous among Vertebrata."--Agassiz, o/>. cit., p. 86.

basis: and the degree of progress at which *animality' can be predicated,
is ' on a par' with that at which ' vegetality' can be predicated. Then follow
other steps of complexity, by which plants and animals diverge from each

other as they rise in the scale of perfection.

   The experiments of Trembley on the freshwater polype, those of Spal-
lanzani on the Naiads, and those of Bonnet on the Aphides, had brought to
light the phenomena of propagation by fission, and by gemmation or buds,
external and internal, in animals, to which Hunter refers. Subsequent research
has shown the unexpected extent to which Hunter's first principle of pro-
pagation in organic beings prevails in the animal division. But the earliest
formal supersession of Harvey's axiom, 'omne vivum ab ovo,' appears to be
Hunter's proposition of the dual principle above quoted. Bacon readily

accepted, as, indeed, it was congenial with his physiological philosophy, the
doctrine current in his day of the spontaneous origin of worms, insects, eels,
and other 'creeping things.' But this doctrine receives no countenance from
the modification of the Harveian dictum introduced by the great English

physiologist of the last century.

   The experiments of Redi, Malpighi, and others, had progressively con-

tracted the field to which the ' generatio aequivoca' could with any plausibility

be applied. The stronghold of the remaining advocates of that old Egyptian
doctrine was the fact of the development of parasitic animals in the flesh,
brain and glands of higher animals. But the hypothesis never obtained

currency in this country ; it was publicly opposed in my ' Hunterian Lec-

tures,' by the fact of the prodigious preparation of fertile eggs in many of

the supposed spontaneously developed species ; and in then suggesting that

the ' Trichina spiralis' of the human muscular tissue might be the embryo
of a larger worm in course of migration, I urged that a particular investiga-
tion was needed for each particular species*. Among the most brilliant of

recent acquisitions to this part of physiology have been the discoveries M'hich

have resulted from such special investigations. Kuchenmeister and Von
Siebold have been the chief labourers in this field. I may instance a few

of their results.

The ' thread-worms' {Filarice) of certain insects, which present no trace

of sexual organs, were supposed to be spontaneously developed in those in-

sects. The little worms were, however, by special and due research, seen to
wind their May out of the caterpillars they infested. Von Siebold placed

these free Filarice in damp earth, into which they soon bored : in a few

weeks he found that the sexual organs were developed in them, and that

they laid hundreds of eggs. Early in spring the young worms were hatched

and began to creep about. Von Siebold took some young caterpillars of

the moth ( Yponomeula euonymella), in which were no parasites : ho placed

them in the  soft  earth in which  the young Filari<s had  been         hatched                                      and
                                                                                                                  ;

in twenty-four hours most of the caterpillars were infested by the young

thread-worms, which had bored their way through the soft skin into their

interior.

   The long halv-worm of fvesh-waters (Gordius aquaticus), vulgarly con-

ceived to be the result of a metamorphosis of the hair of a horse's tail, passes
its early life as a parasite in the body of an insect.

   But many entozoa acquire their full or sexual development, not as free
worms, but within the body of another animal, and of a species distinct from
that in which they had passed the early or larval stage of their existence.

   The trematode parasite of a water-fowl produces eggs, from each of which
is hatched a ciliated infusorial-like young. These young escape into the
water, and there swim about by their vibratile cilia, like Infusoria; some of
them enter the body of a water-snail ; but they are merely the locomotive

envelope of a differently-shaped smooth-skinned organism, resembling in its
simple uniform granular structure a Gregarina ; and the function of that
ciliated envelope was to introduce the Gregarina into the body of the water-
snail. So introduced, the growth of the gregariniform parasite proceeds, and a
progeny is seen to arise in its interior, by the development of several of the
contained germ-cells into embryos : it proves, indeed, to be a mere cyst for

such, as the infusorial larva had been a cyst for it. The embryos gradually
acquire the form of a Cercaria. These escape from the cyst, bore their way
out of the snail, and disperse themselves as free swimming tadpole-like

animalcules in the water. No sexual organs exist in these ' Cercarice,' any

more than in their animated ' coat' the Gregarina, or in their ciliated
'great-coat' the infusorial embryo. After the larval Cercarice have passed
some time in the watei', first creeping and then swimming about with great
restlessness, they either enter directly the body of a water-fowl, or bore
their way into some aquatic insect, or they may fail in both these instinctive
efforts and remain in the water. In any case they undergo a metamorphosis.
The Cercaria gathers itself up into a ball and exudes a nmcous secretion
from its surface, which soon iiardens ; and, since the worm, inside this mucous

mass, turns round without stopping, it invests itself with a kind of egg-shell

during this process the tail is cast off.
    Should this process take place within the body of an insect, the encysted

 Cercaria might be introduced into the body of an insectivorous bird or beast.
In the act of digestion by the engulpher the body of the insect is destroyed,
together with the capsule of the cercarian pupa; but this by virtue of its
vitality remains unharmed, and is thus transplanted into a sphere fitted for its
further change into a sexual entozoon of the Trematode or * fluke-worm' order.

    Then again commences the strange and complex genetic cycle from the

--Harveian point the impregnated ovum.

  -- --Three different species of animal may contribute two are essential to

 the successful progress of the ordinary and parthenogenetic processes of pro-
 pagation manifested by the three distinct forms of Infusory, Gregarina and
 Cercaria, intervening between the egg and the perfect parasitic fluke-worm.
ADDRESS.  Ixxiii

    This instance, (a knowledge of which is clue chiefly to the researches of

Vou Siebold) I have thought it requisite to quote, in order to convey some
idea to my non-physiological auditors of the singular complexity of powers
and arrangements tending to the ultimate right lodgement and well-being of

a seemingly insignificant noxious little parasite.

   The sum of the recent researches on the generation of the Entozoa teaches

that to the success in life of the majority of these internal parasites, two

different species of much higher organized animals are subservient; and that

these two species stand in the relation of prey and devourer.

   The habits of the prey favour the accidental introduction (as when a slug

crawls over the droppings of a thrush) of the eggs of the birds' intestinal

parasite. These are hatched in the slug. The slug in its turn is devoured

--by the thrush ; but the parasitic passengers are not digested only the coach

is dissolved, and the larvae, thus set free, find in the warm intestines of the

bird the appropriate conditions for their metamorphosis and full develop-

ment.

    In like manner, i\ie Rhynchobothria of a cuttle-fish are the larvae of the

Tetrarhi/ncJms or four-tentacled tape-worm of a dog-fish. The encysted
sexless Trimnophorus of the liver of the char becomes the free and perfect
TricBnophoriis of the gut of the pike. The Ligula of a herring becomes a
TcEnia only when introduced into the interior of a cormorant. The bladder-
worm (^Cysticercus fasciolaris) of the mouse's liver becomes the tape-worm
( Tcenia crassicollis) of the cat. The Cysticercus pisiformis of the liver of
the hare becomes the Tcenia serrata of the dog and fox.

   Dr. Kiichenmeister of Zittau first proved, experimentally, by feeding
animals with Cysticerci (Hydatids of the flesh and glands of herbivorous
animals), that they became TccnicB (intestinal tape-worms) in carnivorous
animals. The results of these instructive experiments were published in
1851 *. They have been successfully repeated, amplified, and scientifically
explained, in regard to every particular and step of the progress, by the

indefatigable and accurate Von Siebold f. The part which Parthenogenesis

plays in the clianging scenes of entozoal life is acutely discerned and clearly
explained in this work.

   Since the time when it was first discovered that plants and animals
could propagate in two ways, and that the individual developed from
the bud might produce a seed or egg, from which also an individual

--might spring capable of again budding, since this alternating mode of

generation was observed, as by Chamisso and Sars, in cases where the

--budding individual differed much in form from the egg-laying one the

subject has been systematized:):, generalized, with an attempt to explain its

principle*, and greatly advanced f, especially, and in a highly interesting

manner, in Von Siebold's late treatise, entitled " Wahre Parthenogenesis bei

Schmetterlingen und Bienen," in which the virgin-production of the male or

drone-bee is demonstrated.

Von Siebold, having subjected to the closest microscopic scrutiny and

experiment the conclusion to which the practical Bee-master Dzierson had

arrived, relative to the cause of Queen-bees with crippled wings producing
a swarm exclusively of drones, has demonstrated that the male-bee is pro-

duced from an egg which has been subjected to no influence save that of the

maternal parent ; whilst such egg, if impregnated, would have produced a

female or worker-bee.

Von Siebold has established the same most interesting phase of partheno-

genesis in certain Lepidoptera, e. g. Solenohia lichenella, S. clathrella, Psyche

helix ; and he calls this phase emphatically ' true parthenogenesis.'

Bonnet's famous experiments on the parthenogenetic Aphides have been

repeated and confirmed by myselfJ and others. Hartig§ Las shown the
same property in the genera Cynijjs and Apophyllus, whicli explains the fact

of the appearance of Cynips lignicola in vast numbers in the south-west of

England during the present and preceding summers, but all of the female sex.

The little crustaceans of the genus Daphne have long been known to produce

Aagamic eggs.        newly-hatched female isokted in a tumbler will produce a

brood of the same sex, whence a second brood will issue, to perhaps the sixth

generation. Mr. John Lubbock, in an admirable paper in the ' Philosophical

Transactions' for 1857, has repeated the experiments of Jurine, and added

many valuable facts. He has pointed out the precise relations between the

agamic and ephippial eggs. The young from any one brood of agamic eggs

are all of one sex, which usually is female : but in one instance Mr. Lubbock

observed that they were all males. His memoir will well repay a careful study.

I had previously stated the grounds for concluding that there was no essential

distinction between buds and eggs, and for anticipating that every gradation

would be found between them : and many steps in that series have been since
supplied by Lubbock, Leidy, and Von Siebold.

Gsertner has given an abridged account of experiments, showing that

some plants have the power of producing ' agamic' or fertile but unpoUenized

seeds : c, g. Zeu Mays, Cannabis sativa, Spinacia oleracea, Mercurialis
annua ; and if doubt may yet attend the results of the experiments on these
and other plants which Gaertner cites, none, I believe, is now entertained by

botanists of the germinative power of the seeds, independently of any action

of pollen, of the Coelobogyne ilicifolia. This plant, a native of Moreton Bay,

Australia, is dioecious like the rest of the order (^Euphorbiacece) to which it

Abelongs.  female plant was sent to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew

some years ago, where it may now be seen in full vigour ; but year after year

this pistil-bearing individual has formed its flowers and fertile seeds as per-

fectly reproductive as if its staminiferous mate was blooming in the next

parterre. No male plant has yet, in fact, been introduced.

M. Lehocq has recorded in the ' Comptes Rendus de I'Acad. des Sciences,'

Dec. 1856, the same phenomena in Trinia vulgaris, Mercurialis annua, and

some other plants.

The now well-investigated phenomena of parthenogenesis in Hydrozoa

have resulted in showing, as in the analogous case of Entozoa, that animals

differing so mucii in form as to have constituted two distinct orders or classes,

--are really but two terms of a cycle of metagenetic transformations the

acalephan Medusa being the sexual locomotive form of the agamic rooted

budding polype, just as the cestoid Taenia is of the cystic Hydatid.

In Hydrozoa (Hydroid Polypes or Sertularians) the young are propagated,

as in plants, by ' buds,  and  also,  as  in  most plants,  by ' germs' or                         :'

                                                                            ' seeds

these latter are contained in 'germ-sacs' projecting from the outer surface,

which is another analogy to the flowering parts of plants. The germ-sac

contains either bare-eyed medusae, or medusoid germs in small closed ' sporo-

sacs.' Both medusjfi and medusoids contain either the eggs or the pollen-

like zoosperms. The germ-sac may be 'simple' or 'compound,' the latter

containing a special organ or process of the ' caenosarc,' from whose sides

bud out the sporosacs or medusae.

The first acquaintance with these marvels excited the hope that we were

about to penetrate the mystery of the origin of different species of animals;

but as far as observation has yet extended, the cycle of changes is definitely

closed. And, since one essential step in the series is the fertilized seed or egg,

the Harveian axiom, 'omne vivum abovo,' if metagenetic phases be ascribed

to one individual, may be still predicated of all organisms which bear the

unmistakeable characters of Plants or of Animals.

The closest observations of the subjects of these two kingdoms most

favourable to clear insight into the nature of their beginning, accumulate

evidence in proof of the essential first step being due to the protoplasmic

matter of a germ-cell and sperm-cell ; the former pre-existing in the form of

a nucleus or protoplast, the latter as a granulose fluid. In flowering plants

it is conveyed by the pollen-tube, in animals and many flowerless plants by

locomotive spermatozoids.

Ixxvi  --REPORT 1858,

   In regard to lower living things, analogy is but hazardous ground for con-

clusions. The single-celled organisms, such as many of the so-called ani-

malcules of infusions, which are at a stage of organization too low for a definite
transfer to either the vegetable or animal kingdoms, offer a field of obser-

vation and experiment which may yet issue in giving us a clearer insight

into the development of the organic living cell.
   Whether an independent free-moving and assimilating organism, of a

grade of structure similar to, and scarcely higher than the ' germ-cell,' may

not arise by a collocation of particles, through the operation of a force ana-
logous to that which originally formed the germ-cell in the ovarian stroma,
is a question which cannot be answered until every possible care and pains

have been applied to its solution.

   The changes of form which the representative of a species undergoes in

successive agamically propagating individuals are termed the ' metagenesis'

of such species. The changes of form which the representative of a species
undergoes in a single individual is called the ' metamorphosis.' But this

term has practically been restricted to the instances in which the individual,
during certain phases of the change, is free and active, as in the grub of the

chaffer, or the tadpole of the frog, for example.
   In reference to some supposed essential differences in the metamorphoses

of insects, it had been suggested that stages answering to those represented
by the apodal and acephalous maggot of the Diptera, by the hexapod larva
of the Carabi, and by the hexapod antenniferous larvae of the Meloe were
really passed through by the orthopterous insect, before it quitted the egg*.

   Mr. Andrew Murray t has recently made known some facts in confirma-

tion of this view. He had received a wooden idol from Africa, behind the

ears of which a Blatta had fixed its egg-cases, after which the whole figure
had been rudely painted by the natives, and these egg-cases were covered by

the paint. No insect could have emerged without breaking through the case

and the paint ; but both were uninjured. In the egg-cases were discovered,
1st, a grub-like larva in the egg; 2nd, a cocoon in the egg containing the
unwinged, imperfectly-developed insect ; 3rd, the unwinged, imperfectly-
developed insect in the egg, free from the cocoon, and ready to emerge.

    Such observations tending to remove supposed exceptions and anomalies,

and to illustrate and establish the common law to which they can be reduced,

 are of the highest value in Natural History.

gical and histological researches, as also in reference to that vast swarm of

the microscope to particular tissues and particular classes, chiefly due, in
this country, to the counsels and example of the Microscopical Society of
London.

  A very interesting application of the microscope has been made to the

particles of matter suspended in the atmosphere ; and a systematic continuation
of such observations by means of glass slides prepared to catch and retain
atmospheric atoms, promises to be productive of important results.

  We now know that the so-called red-snow of Arctic and Alpine regions is a

microscopic single-celled organism which vegetates on the surface of snow.
    Cloudy or misty extents of dust-like matter pervading the atmosphere,

such as have attracted the attention of travellers in the vast coniferous
forests of North America, and have been borne out to sea, have been found
to consist of the ' pollen ' or fertilizing particles of plants, and have been

called ' pollen showers.'

   M, Daneste*, submitting to microscopic examination similar dust which

fell from a cloud at Shanghai, found that it consisted of spores of a confervoid
plant, probably the Trichodesmmm erythrceum, which vegetates in, and im-
parts its peculiar colour to, the Chinese Sea.

    Decks of ships, near the Cape de Verd Islands, have been covered by such
so-called 'showers' of impalpable dust, which, by the microscope of Ehrenberg,

has been shown to consist of minute organisms, chiefly ' Diatomaceae.' One

sample collected on a ship's deck 500 miles off the coast of Africa, exhibited
numerous species of freshwater and marine diatoms bearing a close resem-
blance to South American forms of those organisms. Ehrenberg has recorded
numerous other instances in his paper printed in the ' Berlin Transactions ;
 but here, as in other exemplary series of observations of the indefatigable

microscopist, the conclusions are perhaps not so satisfactory as the well-
observed data.

   He speculates upon the self-developing power of organisms in the atmo-

sphere, affirms that dust-showers are not to be traced to mineral material
 from the earth's surface, nor to revolving masses of dust material in space,
 nor to atmospheric currents simply ; but to some general law connected with
 the atmosphere of our planet, according to which there is a ' self-development'

M'ithin it of living organisms, which organisms he suspects may have some
 relation to the periodical meteorolites or aerolites. The advocates of pro-

 gressive development n)ay see and hail in this the first step in the series of

 ascending transmutations. The unbiassed observer will be stimulated by the
 startling hypothesis of the celebrated Berlin Professor to more frequent and
 regular examinations of atmospheric organisms. Some late examinations
 of dust-showers clearly show them to have a source which Ehrenberg has

 denied. Some of my hearers may remember the graphic description by

 Her Majesty's Envoy to Persia, the Hon. C. A. Murray, of the cloud of

 impalpable red dust which darkened the air of Bagdad, and filled the city

 with a panic. The specimen he collected was examined by my successor

 at the Royal College of Surgeons, Prof. Quekett; and that experienced
 microscopist could detect only inorganic particles, such as fine quartz sand,
 without any trace of Diatomaceee or other organic matter. Dr. I awson has
 obtained a similar result from the examination of the material of a shower

 of moist dust or mud which fell at Corfu in March 1 857 : it consisted for

 the most part of minute angular particles of a quartzose sand.
     Here, therefore, is a field of observation for the microscopist, which has

 doubtless most interesting results as the reward of persevering research.

    Many ' dust-showers ' consist in greater or less proportions of microscopic
 organisms, but not all. To determine the source of these organisms is the

 legitimate aim of such researches. It must be remembered, also, that the

expression ' spontaneously developed ' in the atmosphere, may only mean
what is meant when it was formerly applied to the internal parasites of man
and animals, viz. ignorance of the true mode of origin. And since per-

 severing observation and experiment, in regard to tape-worms and ascarides,
have thrown such new and unexpected light upon their origin and migrations,

so the like result may reward similar labours applied to the parasitic ' dust-

showers ' of the atmosphere.

  --Microgeology. The microscopic organisms hitherto observed in the oldest

fossiliferous deposits, Silurian Greensands, for instance, are spicula of
SpongicB, siliceous Polycystinece, and calcareous Foraminifera.

    Ehrenberg has discovered that the substance of the greensands in stratified
deposits, from the Silurian to the Tertiary periods inclusive, is composed of
the casts of the interior of the microscopic shells of Polycystinecs and ForO"

mini/era. The soundings which have been brought up from various parts

of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, consist chiefly of similar microscopic
polythalamous shells, mingled with a greensand composed of casts of Fora-

minifera. Thus the mode in which a deposit was made at the bottom of the

deep primeval ocean of the Silurian period, is illustrated by that which the
microscope has demonstrated to take place under similar conditions at the

present day.

    The earliest indubitable evidence of diatoms has been obtained from the
Eocene strata ; and the forms here determined have been for the most part
identified with existing species. Exotic species are not distinguishable from

the British ; difference of climate seems not to affect or relate to specific
difference, and the same exemption from such influence through the minute
size and simple structure of the Diatomaceae, seems to have been the chief
condition of their geological longevity as species.

   To specify or analyse the labours of the individuals who of late years have

contributed to advance zoology by the comprehensive combination of the

various kinds of research now felt to be essential to its right progress, would
demand a proportion of the present discourse far beyond its proper and

allotted limits.

ADDRESS.  Ixxix

   Yet I shall not be deemed invidious if I cite one work as eminently exem-
plary of the spirit and scope of the investigations needed for the elucidation
of any branch of Natural History. That work is the monograph of the
Chelonian Reptiles (Tortoises, Terrapenes and Turtles) of the United States
of America, published last year at Boston, U.S., by Professor Agassiz.

   I cite it, not wholly on account of its intrinsic merits, but also because it

affords me the opportunity of expressing, on the part of naturalists, the ad-

miration of, and deep sense of gratitude to, the great and liberal people whose
perception of the intrinsic value and dignity of pure science has enabled the
distinguislied author to enrich zoology by a work unparalleled in the
completeness, perfection, and consequent expense of its graphic illustrations.

   We" had fixed," writes Agassiz, " upon five hundred subscribers as the

--number necessary to enter upon the publication with safety : at this moment

--it stands at twenty-five hundred, a support such as was never before offered

to any scientific man for purely scientific ends, without any reference to

government objects or direct practical aims*."

  --Geographical Distribution of Plants. Observations of the characters of

plants, the record of such observations by the Linnaean and subsequently
improved artifices of description, the application of this power to comparison,

--and deductions from the results of such comparisons, have led to the

recognition of the natural groups or families of tlie vegetable kingdom, and
to a clear scientific comprehension of that great department of living Nature.

    This phase of botanical science gives the power of further and more pro-

fitable generalizations, such as those teaching the relations between the par-
ticular plants and particular localities.

    The sum of these relations, forming the Geographical Distribution of

Plants, rests, pei-haps at present necessarily, on an assumption, viz. that each
species has been created, or come into being, but once in time and space

and that its present diff'usion is the result of its own law of reproduction,

under the diftusive or restrictive influence of external circumstances. These
circumstances are chiefly temperature and moisture, dependent on the distance
from the source of heat and the obliquity of the sun's rays, modified by alti-
tude above the sea-level, or the degree of rarefaction of the atmosphere, and
 of the power of the surface to radiate heat. Both latitude and altitude
are further modified by currents of air and ocean, which influence
 the distribution of the heat they have absorbed. Thus large tracts of dry
land produce dry and extreme climates, while large expanses of sea produce
humid and equable climates. Botany, in short, at this phase becomes inti-
 mately related to climatology ; and the traveller, the meteorologist, and the
 naturalist reciprocally aid each other in the acquisition of a knowledge of
 fruitful general laws. Agriculture aff'ects the geographical distribution of
 plants, both directly and indirectly. It diff'uses plants over a wider area of

equal climate, augments their productiveness, and enlarges the limits of their
capacity to support different climatal conditions. Agriculture also effects
local modifications of climate. Tlie clearance of forests, by diminishing the
cooling influence of evaporation from leaves, increases the temperature.
When, by the spread of thorough drainage over Britain, the surface-water is
at once carried off, instead of remaining on the surface until slowly dispersed
by evaporation and atmospheric currents, such prompt removal of tlie raw

material of mist and cloud may be reasonably expected to be attended with
a greater average annual amount of solar light and heat.

   Certain species of plants require more special physical conditions for
health ; others more general conditions ; and their extent of diffusion varies
accordingly. Thus the plants of temperate climates are more widely diffused

over the surface of the globe, because they are suited to elevated tracts in

tropical latitudes.

   There is, however, another law which relates to the original appearance, or
creation, of plants, and which has produced different species flourishing under
similar physical conditions, in different regions of the globe. Thus the plants
of the mountains of South America are of distinct species, and for the most

part of distinct genera, from those of Asia. The plants of the temperate
latitudes of North America are of distinct species, and some of distinct
genera, from those of Europe. The Cactece of the hot regions of Mexico are

represented by the Etiphorbiacece in parts of Africa having a similar climate.

   The modes of generalizing the observations on the geographical distribution

of indigenous plants are various.

   One is by dividing the horizontal range of vegetation into zones, bounded

by annual isothermal lines, as, 1, the equatorial ; 2, tropical ; 3, subtropical
4, warmer temperate ; 5, cooler temperate ; 6, subarctic ; 7> arctic
8, polar zones: with temperatures progressively falling from an annual
isotherm of 79°*3 Fahr. to one of 36°*5 for the month of July.

   Another mode is the classification of plants according to the regions of

--altitude; as into those of, 1, Palms; 2, Tree-ferns; 3, Myrtles ; 4-, Ever-

greens ; 5, Deciduous trees ; 6, Conifers ; 7, Alpine shrubs ; 8, Alpine herbs.
But the corresponding altitudes in different countries have frequently dif-
ferent, though analogous or representative, species. The presence or other-
wise of snow on the mountain-tops also influences the character of the plants
at corresponding altitudes. Thus, forests of tall Conifers flourish in the
Himalayas at regions of altitude where only stunted specimens of tropical
plants are found in the mountains of Sumatra.

  A third, and perhaps more truly natural mode of expressing the geogra-

phical distribution of plants, is by regions defined by the proportion of plant-

species peculiar to them. When one half, at least, of the known species are

peculiar to a certain space, it constitutes a ' phy togeographic ' region, accord-
ing to Schouw. In it, also, a fourth part of the genera must be either pecu-
liar, or so predominating as to be comparatively rare in other regions ; and
                           ADDRESS.                                  Ixxxi

the individual families of plants must be either peculiar to, or decidedly pre-

dominate in, such region.

    So defined, the surface of the earth has been divided into twenty-five re-

gions, of wiiicli I may cite as examples that of New Zealand, in which Ferns

predominate, together with generic forms, half of which are European, and

the rest approximating to Australian, South African, and Antarctic fos-ma ;

and tiiat of Australia, characterized by its EucalypU and Epacriden, chieti_7
known to us by the researches of the great botanist, Robert Brown, the

founder of the ' Geography of Plants.'

   Of the heaths, or heath-like shrubs, some genera. Erica, or true heath, for
example, characterize the Cape of Good Hope and Europe ; other genera
the Cape and New Holland; others again, as Epacris, Lissanthe, and Leuco-

pogon, are characteristic of Australia.

The vegetable kingdom has been classified into many such physiogno-

mical groups. The latest botanical statistics make 213,280 species; but the

best informed botanists believe that we are still acquainted only with a small

proportion of existing plants.

  --Geographical Distribution of Animals. Organic Life, in its animal form,

is much more developed, and more variously, in the sea, than in its vegetable

form.

Observations of marine animals and their localities have led to attempts

at generalizing the results ; and the modes of enunciating these generaliza-

tions or laws of geographical distribution are very analogous to those

which have been applied to the vegetable kingdom, which is as di-

versely developed on land as is the animal kingdom in the sea. Certain
horizontal areas, or provinces, have been characterized by the entire assem-

blage of animals and plants constituting their population, of which a consider-

able proportion is peculiar to each province, and the majority of the species

have their areas of maximum development within it.
   Of such provinces of Marine Life, that much-lamented, far-seeing, and

genial philosopher, Edward Forbes, has provisionally defined 25.

The same physical conditions are associated with a certain similarity be-

tween the animals of different provinces. Where those provinces are proxi-

mate, such likeness is due to the identity or close affinity of the species ; but
where the provinces are remote, the resemblance is one of analogy, and spe-

cies of different genera or families represent each other.

  A second mode of expressing the ascertained facts of the geographical

distribution of marine animals is by tracts called ' Homoiozoic Belts,' bounded

by climatal lines, which are not, however, parallel with lines of latitude, but

undulate in subordination to climatal influences of warm or cold oceanic
currents, relations of land to water, &c. Of these belts. Professor E. Forbes

has defined nine : one equatorial, with four to the north and four to the south,

  which are mutually representative.

^ But the most interesting form of expression of the distribution of marine

life is that which parallels the perpendicular distribution of plants. Edward

forbes, availing himself of the valuable results of a systematic use of the
dredge, first showed that marine animals and plants varied according to the

depth at which they lived, in a manner very analogous to the changes in the
forms and species of vegetation observed in the ascent of a tropical moun-

tain. He has expressed these facts by defining five bathymetrical zones, or

belts of depth, which he calls,-- 1, Littoral; 2, Circumlittoral; 3, Median;

4, Infra-median ; 5, Abyssal.

   The life-forms of these zones vary, of course, according to the nature of

the sea-bottom ; and are modified by those primitive or creative laws that

--conditions, species related by analogy.

Very much remains to be observed and studied by Naturalists in different

out, to the completion of a perfect theory. But in the progress to this, the

Aresults cannot fail to be practically most valuable.  shell or a sea-weed,

whose relations to depth are thus understood, may afford important in-

formation or warning to the navigator. To the geologist the distribution of

marine life according to the zones of depth has given the clue to the deter-
mination of the depth of the seas in which certain formations have been

deposited.

By the light of these laws of geographical distribution we view with quite

Wea new interest the shells, corals, and sea-weeds of our own shores.  trace

the regions whence they have been invaded by races not aboriginally be-

longing to our seas ; we obtain indications of irruptions of sea-currents of

dates anterior to the present arrangements of land and water. Thus, part of

our marine fauna has been traced back to the older pliocene period, part to

the somewhat newer period of the red-crag, part to the still more recent

--glacial period all these being anterior to the constitution of the ' Celtic

Province,' as it is now displayed.

With regard to the class of Fishes, some families, the Sharks (Squaloids),

Herrings (Halecoids), and Mackerel-kind (Scomberoids), are cosmopolitan.

The Labyrinthodonts are limited to the Indian Ocean ; the Goniodonts to

the rivers of South America ; the Lepidostei to those of North America ; the
Polypteri to those of Africa. The fish called Chaca is restricted to the Lake

Baikal, and the blind ' AniMt/opsis ' to the Mammoth cave : just as the Pro-

teus amongst amphibious reptiles is confined to the caverns of Carinthia.

The class of animals to which the restrictive laws of geographical distri-

bution might seem least applicable is that of Birds : their peculiar powers of

locomotion, associated in numerous species with migratory habits, might seem

to render them independent of every influence save those of climate and of

food, which directly affect the conditions of their existence. Yet the

long-winged Albatros is never met with north of the equator; nor does

the Condor soar above other mountains than the Andes. The geogra-

pliical range of its European representative, the strong-winged Lamitier-
ge5'er, is similarly restricted. The Asiatic PhasianidcB and PavonidcB are
represented by Turkeys (^Meleagris) in America ; by the Guinea-fowl {Nu-
mida, Agelastus, Phasidus) in Africa ; and by tlie Megapodidce, or Mound-
birds, in Australia. Several genera of Finches are peculiar to the Galapagos

Islands ; the richly and fantastically ornate Birds of Paradise are restricted

to New Guinea and some neighbouring isles. Mr. Sclater, who has contri-

buted the latest summary of facts on the distribution of Birds, reckons 17

families as peculiar to America, and 16 families as peculiar to Europe, Asia,

and Africa. Some species have a singularly restricted locality, as, the Red-

grouse (Teirao scoticus') to the British Isles; the Owl-parrot {Nestor pro'

ductus) to Philip Island, a small spot near New Zealand.
   When birds have wings too short for flight, we marvel less at their re-

stricted range ; and particular genera of brevipennate birds have their pecu-
liar continents or islands. The long- and strong-limbed Ostrich courses over
the whole continent of Africa and conterminous Arabia. The genus of
three-toed Ostriches (Rhea) is similarly restricted to South America. The

Emeu {Dromaius) has Australia assigned to it. The continent of the Casso-

wary (Casuarius) has been broken up into islands including and extending

from the south-eastern peninsula of Asia to New Guinea and New Britain.

The singular nocturnal wingless Kivi (^Apteryx) is peculiar to the islands of

New Zealand.

   Other species and genera, which seem to be, like the Apteryx, as it were
mocked with feathers and rudiments of wings, have wholly ceased to exist

within the memory of man in the islands to which they also were respectively
restricted. The Dodo (Didus ineptus) of the Mauritius, and the Solitaire

(^Pezophaps solitaria) are instances.

   In New Zealand also there existed, within the memory of the Maori ances-

try, huge birds having their nearest affinities to the still existing Apteryx of
that island, but generically distinct from that and all other known birds. I

have proposed the name of Di?iornts for this now extinct genus, of which

more than a dozen well-defined species have come to my knowledge, all pecu-
liar to New Zealand and the last-discovered the strangest, by reason of the

elephantine proportions of its feet.

  A tridactyle wingless bird of another genus, ^pyornis, second only to the

--gigantic Dinornis in size, appears to have also recently become extinct if
--it be extinct in the Island of Madagascar. The egg of this bird, which

may have suggested to the Arabian voyagers attaining Madagascar from the
Red Sea the idea of the Roc of their romances, would hold the contents of
G eggs of the Ostrich, 16 eggs of the Cassowary, and 148 eggs of the common

Fowl.

   The laws of geographical distribution, as affecting mammalian life, have
been reduced to great exactness by observations continued since the time of
Buffon, who first began to generalize, just a century ago, in that way.noting the

peculiarities of the species of South American animals *. The most import-

ant extension of this branch of zoology has been due to recent researches

and discoveries of extinct species of the class Mammalia ; and it is chiefly
in relation to the modifications of zoological ideas produced by palaeontology

that a few brief remarks will here be made.

    The Quadrumana, or order of Apes, Monkeys, and Lemurs, consist of

--three chief divisions Catarhines, Platyrhines, and Strepsirhines. The first

family is peculiar to the ' Old World ; ' the second to South America ; the
third has the majority of its species, and its chief genus (Zemwr), exclusively
in Madagascar. Out of 26 known species of Lemuridce, only 6 are Asiatic
and 3 are African.

    The Catarhine monkeys include the Macaques, most of which are Asiatic,

a few are African, and one European ; tiie Cercopitheques, most of which are
African, and a few Asiatic ; and other genera which characterize one or
other continent exclusively. Thus the true Baboons (Papio) are African,
as are the thumbless Monkeys (Colobus) and the Chimpanzees (^Troglo-
dytes). The Semnopitheques, Gibbons, and Orangs are peculiarly Asiatic.
Palaeontology has shown that a Macaque, a Gibbon, and an Orang existed
during the older tertiary times in Europe ; and that a Seninopithecus existed
in miocene times in India. But all the fossil remains of Quadrumana in the
Old World belong to the family Catarldna, which, is still exclusively confined
to that great division of dry land. The tail-less Macaque (Inuus silvanus)

of Gibraltar may have existed in that part of the Old World before Europe

was separated by the Straits of Gibraltar from Africa. Fossil remains
of Quadrumana have been discovered in South America ; they indicate
 Platyrhine forms : a species, for example, allied to the Howlers (Mycetes), but
larger than any now known to exist, has left its remains in Brazil.

    Whilst adverting to the geographical distribution of Quadrumana, I would
contrast the peculiarly limited range of the Orangs and Chimpanzees with
the cosmopolitan powers of mankind. The two species of Orang (Pithecus)
 are confined to Borneo and Sumatra ; the two species of Chimpanzee (Tro-
glodytes) are limited to an intertropical tract of the western part of Africa.
They appear to be inexorably bound by climatal influences regulating the
 assemblage of certain trees and the production of certain fruits. With all
 our care, in regard to choice of food, clothing, and contrivances for artifi-

 cially maintaining the chief physical conditions of their existence, the

 healthiest specimens of Orang or Chimpanzee, brought over in the vigour of
 youth, perish within a period never exceeding three years, and usually much
shorter, in our climate. By what metamorphoses, we may ask, has the

Buflfon was treating of the carnivorous animal which travellers in South America had called

the ' Lion' : "Lepuma n'est point un hon, tirant son origine des lions de I'ancien conti-

alleged humanized Chimpanzee or Orang been brought to endure all
climates? The advocates of ' transmutation ' have failed to explain them.

Certain it is that those physical differences in cerebral, dental, and osteolo-

gical structure, which place, in my estimate of them, the genus Homo in a

distinct group of the mammalian class, zoologically of higher value than the

* order,' are associated with equally contrasted powers of endurance of dif-

ferent climates, whereby Man has become a denizen of every part of the

globe from the torrid to the arctic zones.

Climate rigidly limits the range of the Quadrumana latitudinally : crea-

tional and geographical causes limit their range in longitude. Distinct genera

represent each other in the same latitudes of the New and Old Worlds ; and

also, in a great degree, in Africa and Asia. But the development of an

Orang out of a Chimpanzee, or reciprocally, is physiologically inconceivable,

The order Ruminantia is principally represented by Old World spe-

cies, of which 162 have been defined ; whilst only 24 species have been

discovered in the New World, and none in Australia, New Guinea, New

Zealand, or the Polynesian Isles.

The Camelopard is now peculiar to Africa ; the Musk-deer to Africa and

Asia : out of about 50 defined species of Antelope, only one is known in

America, and none in the central and southern divisions of the New World.

The Bison of North America is distinct from the Bison of Europe. The

Musk-ox alone, peculiar for its limitation to high northern latitudes, roams

over the arctic coasts of both Asia and America. The Deer-tribe are more

widely distributed. The Camels and Dromedaries of the Old World are

represented by the Llamas and Vicugnas of the New. As, in regard to a

former (tertiary) zoological period, the fossil CamelidcB of Asia are of the

genus Camelus, so those of America are of the genus Auchenia. This geo-

graphical restriction ruled prior to any evidence of man's existence.

Palaeontology has expanded our knowledge of the range of the Giraffe

during miocene or old pliocene periods, species of Camelojiardalis roamed in

Asia and Europe. Passing to the non-ruminant Artiodactyles, geology has

also taught us that the Hippopotamus was not always confined, as now, to

African rivers, but bathed, during pliocene times, in those of Asia and

Europe. But no evidence has yet been had that the Giraffe or Hippo-

potamus were ever other than Old World forms of Ungulata,

With respect to the Hog-tribe, we find that the true Swine {Sus) of the

Old World  are represented  by  Peccaries   (Dicoti/les)  in  the  New                      and geo-
                                                                                         ;

logy has recently shown that tertiary species oi Dicotyles existed in North as

well as South America. But no true Stis has been found fossil in either

division of the New World, nor has a Dicotyles been found fossil in the

Old World of the geographer. Phacochcerus (Wart-hogs) is a genus of the

Hog-tribe at present peculiar to Africa,

   The Rhinoceros is a genus now represented only in Asia and Africa ; the
species being distinct in the two continents. The islands of Java and of
IxXXvi  --REPORT 1858.

Sumatra have each their peculiar species; that of the latter being two-

horned, as all the African Rhinoceroses are. Three or more species of

--two-horned Rhinoceros formerlj' inhabited Europe one of them warmly

clad, for a cold climate; but no fossil remains of the genus have been met
with save in the Old World of the geographer. One of the earliest forms

of European Rhinoceros was devoid of the nasal weapon.
   Geology gives a wider range to the Horse and Elephant kinds than was

cognizant to the student of living species only. The existing EquidcB and

Elephantidce properly belong to the Old World; and the Elephants are

limited to Asia and Africa, the species of the two continents being quite

distinct. The horse, as Buffon remarked, carried terror to the eye of the

indigenous Americans, viewing the animal for the first time, as it proudly

bore their Spanish conqueror. But a species of Equus coexisted with the

Megatherium and Megalonyx in both South and North America, and perished

apparently with them, before the human period.
   Elephants are dependent chiefly upon trees for food. One species now

finds conditions of existence in the rich forests of tropical Asia ; and a second

species in those of tropical Africa. Why, we may ask, should not a third be

living at the expense of the still more luxuriant vegetation watered by the

Oronooko, the Essequibo, the Amazon, and the La Plata, in tropical

America ? Geology tells us that at least two kinds of Elephant (JSIastodon

Andium and Mast, Humboldtii) formerly did derive their subsistence, along

with the great Megatherioid beasts, from that abundant source. Nay more ; at

least two other kinds of Elephant {Mastodon ohioticus and Elephas texianus)

existed in the warm and temperate latitudes of North America. Twice as

many species of Mastodon and Elephant, distinct from all the others, roamed

in pliocene times in the same latitudes of Europe. At a later or pleistocene

period, a huge elephant, clothed with wool and hair, obtained its food from

hardy trees, such as now grow in the 65th degree of north latitude ; and

abundant remains of this Elephas primigenius (as it has been prematurely

called, since it was the last of our British elephants) have been found in

temperate and high northern latitudes in Europe, Asia, and America. This,

like other Arctic animals, was peculiar in its family for its longitudinal

range. The Musk Buffalo was its contemporary in England and Europe,

and still lingers in the northernmost parts of America.

I have received evidences of Elephantine species from China and Australia,

proving the proboscidian pachyderms to have been the most cosmopolitan of

hoofed herbivorous quadrupeds.

  We may infer that the general growth of large forests, and the absence of

deadly enemies, were the main conditions of the former existence of Ele-

Wephantine animals over every part of the globe.  have the most pregnant

 family. But such retrospective views of life in remote periods in many im-

 portant instances confirm the zoologist's deductions of the originally re-

 stricted range of particular forms of mammalian life. This is the case with
 respect to that singular group of quadrupeds forming the Order Bruta, Linn.,
 or Edentata, Cuv. If a zoological province be defined by the proportion
 of genera and species peculiar to it, South America must be assigned as such
 province for the Bruta ; three out of five of the genera, and a much larger
.proportion of tiie species, being peculiar to that continent. The Sloths
 {Bradypus), the Anteaters {MyrmecopJiagci), and the Armadillos (Dasj/pus),
are the South American genera, or rather families, of Bruta referred to. The
scaly Anteaters or Pangolins (Manis) are represented by long-tailed species
in Africa, and shorter- tailed ones in Asia. The Oiycteropus is represented
by a single species in South Africa.

    Fossil remains of the order Bruta have been discovered in tertiary beds in
Europe and in America. The European fossil was a large Pangolin, and the

discovery shows the natural extent of that province, now imperfectly divided

into Europe, Asia, and Africa, to which the il/ams-form of Bruta is and has
been peculiar.

    Geology also extends the geographical range of the Sloths and Armadillos
from South to North America ; but the deductions from recent rich discoveries
of huge terrestrial forms of Sloth, of gigantic Armadillos, and large Anteaters,
go to establish the fact that these peculiar families of the ovAev Bruta have
ever been, as they are now, peculiar to America ; that several genera, in-
cluding the largest species, have perished; and that the range of their still
existing diminutive representatives has been reduced to the southern division

of the ' New World.'

  --In no other region of the globe than America that to which the Sloths,
--Anteaters, and Armadillos are now peculiar has any fossil relic of an animal

of those families been found : and if it be objected to this evidence of the
primeval limitation of those families to America, that it is chiefly ' negative,' I
would remark, that bones of the Megatherium are as likely to catch the eye
as those of the Elephant ; and would ask, if Megatherioids had co-existed with

Elephants in other continents, as Elephants did with them in America, why
have not their remains been found elsewhere ? The positive and abundant

evidence, however, of the remains of gigantic Sloths and Armadillos in South
America is most conclusive of the original location of these unmigratory

beasts in the New World.

   Australia, which in extent of dry land merits to be regarded as a fifth con-
tinent, has a more restricted and peculiar character of aboriginal mammalian
population than South America. It is emphatically the ' province ' of those
quadrupeds the females of which are provided with a pouch for the trans-
port and protection of their prematurely born young.

   One genus of Marsupialia (^Didelphys or Opossums, properly so called) is

Apeculiar to America, and is there the sole representative of the order.
Ixxxviii  --REPORT 1858.

small Kangaroo, and a few Phalangers, exist in islands that link the

Malayan Archipelago with the Australian world. All the other marsupial

genera, indeed every known genus save Didelphjs, are found in Australasia,

comprising New Guinea, Australia, and Tasmania.

The Kangaroos, Potoroos, Wombats, Koalas, Phalangers, Petaurists, Dasy-

ures, and marsupial quadrupeds of insectivorous and carnivorous habits,

distinguished only by scientific names, here perform the parts assigned to non-

marsupial Mammalia in the Old World. No existing marsupial quadruped

has been found native in continental Asia, in Africa, or in Europe.

   Of the Australasian marsupials the species of New Guinea are distinct, and

some of them subgenerically, from those of Australia proper.

Certain genera, as Tarsipes, Clmropus, Phascolarctus, are peculiar to

Australia ; other genera, as Thylacinus and Sarcophilus, the largest and

most destructive of carnivorous marsupials, are peculiar to Tasmania.

No marsupial fossil has been found in the pliocene or pleistocene deposits

of Europe, Asia, or Africa. In America, only representatives occur of the

peculiarly American genus Didelphys. In the formations of these recent

tertiary periods, and in the limestone caverns, of Australia, abundance of

mammalian fossils have been found, and, with the exception of a single tooth

of a Mastodon, every one of them has proved to be a marsupial species.

Many belong to the genus of Kangaroos (^Macropus), some to that of Poto-

roos {Hypsiprymnus) ; a few to the Wombats (^Phascolomys^, Dasyures (Z)«-
syurus), and other existing genera. Some of these fossils have shown that the

Thylacinus and Sarcophilus formerly inhabited Australia as well as Tasmania.

Others exhibit the carnivorous or Dasyurine modification of the marsupial

type in species equalling the Leopard and the Lion in size ; and the latter

Wewith modifications of the carnassial teeth of generic value.     now know

that there once existed in Australia species of Wombat equalling the Tapir

in stature ; and species most nearly allied to Macropus, but with characters of

Phascolomys and Phascolarctus combined, which rivalled the Ox and Rhi-

noceros in bulk. The skull of the Nototherium presents the strangest pro-

portions and features hitherto seen in the mammalian class : that of the

Diprotodon is 3 feet in length, and combines the scalpriform incisors of the

Wombat with the double-ridged molars of the Kangaroo.

The sum of all the evidence from the fossil world in Australia proves its

mammalian population to have been essentially the same in pleistocene, if not

pliocene times, as now ; only represented, as the Edentate mannuals in South

America were then represented, by moi-e numerous genera, and much more

gigantic species, than now exist.

But geology has revealed more important and unexpected facts relative to

the marsupial type of quadrupeds.

In the miocene and eocene tertiary deposits, marsupial fossils of the

American  genus Didelphys have been found, both  in  France   and  England
                                                                                                      ;

and they are associated with Tapirs like that of America. In a more ancient
ADDRESS.  IxXXix

geological period, remains of marsupials, some insectivorous, as Sjmlaco-
therium and Triconodon, otliers with teeth like the peculiar premolars in
the Australian genus Hypsiprymnus, have been found in the upper oolite of
tiie Isle of Purbeck*. In the lower oolite at Stonesficid, Oxfordshire, mar-
supial remains have been found having their nearest living representatives in
the Australian genera Myrmecohius and Daayurus.

   Thus, it would seem, that the deeper we penetrate the earth, or, in other
words, the further we recede in time, the more completely are Ave absolved
from the present laws of geographical distribution. In comparing the mam-
malian fossils found in British pleistocene and pliocene beds, we have often
to travel to Asia or Africa for their homologues. In the miocene and eocene
strata some fossils occur which compel us to go to America for the nearest
representatives. To match the manmialian remains from the English oolitic
formations, we must bring species from the Antipodes.

    These are truly most suggestive facts, unrecognized until science looked
abroad upon the world. If the present laws of geographical distribution
depend, in an important degree, upon the present configuration and position
of continents and islands, what a total change in the geographical character
of the earth's surface must have taken place since the ' Stonesfield slate' was

deposited in what now forms the county of Oxfordshire !

    These and the like considerations from the modifications of geographical

distribution of particular forms or groups of animals warn us how inadequate
must be the phenomena connected with the present distribution of land and

sea to guide to the determination of the primary ontological divisions of the

earth's surface. Some of the latest contributions to this most interesting

branch of Natural History have been the result of endeavours to determine

whether, and how many, distinct creations of plants and animals have taken

place. But, I would submit, that the discovery of two portions of the
globe, of which the respective Faunee and Florae are different, by no means
affords the requisite basis for concluding as to distinct acts of creation.

    Such conclusion is associated, perhaps unconsciously, with the idea of the

historical date of creative acts : it presupposes that the portion of the globe
so investigated by the botanist and zoologist has been a separate and primitive

--creation, that its geographical limits and features are still in the main what

they were when the creative fiat went forth.
    But Geology has demonstrated that such is by no means the case with

respect to the portions of dry land now termed continents and islands. The
incalculable vistas of time past into which the same science has thrown
light are also shown to have been periods during which the relative positions

 of land and sea have been ever changing.
    Already the directions, and to a certain extent the forms of the submerged

 tracts that once joined what now are islands to continents, and which once
 united now separate or nearly disjoined continents by broad tracts of conti-

--XC REPORT 1858.

nuity, begin to be laid down in geological maps, addressing to the eye such

successive and gradually progressive alterations of the earth's surface.
    These phenomena shake our confidence in the conclusion that the Apteryx

of New Zealand and the Red-grouse of England were distinct creations in
and for those islands respectively. Always, also, it may be well to bear in

mind that by the word ' creation,' the zoologist means ' a process he knows

not what.' Science has not yet ascertained the secondary causes that ope-

rated when " the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its
kind," and when " the waters brought forth abundantly the moving creature

that hath life." And supposing both the fact and the whole process of the

so-called ' spontaneous generation ' of a fruit-bearing tree, or of a fish, were

scientifically demonstrated, we should still retain as strongly the idea, which
is the chief of the ' mode ' or ' group of ideas ' we call ' creation,' viz. that
the process was ordained by and had originated from an all-wise and power-

ful First Cause of all things.

   When, therefore, the present peculiar relation of the Red- grouse (T^e^rao

--scoticus) to Britian and Ireland and I cite it as one of a large class of in-
--stances in Geographical Zoology is enumerated by the zoologist as evidence

of a distinct creation of the bird in and for such islands, he chiefly expresses

that he knows not how the Red-grouse came to be there, and there exclu-
sively ; signifying also, by this mode of expressing such ignorance, his belief
that both the bird and the islands owed their origin to a great first Creative

Cause.

   And this analysis of the real meaning of the phrase ' distinct creation ' has
led me to suggest whether, in aiming to define the primary zoological pro-
vinces of the globe, we may not be trenching upon a province of knowledge

beyond our present capacities ; at least in the judgment of Lord Bacon, com-
menting upon man's efixjrts to pierce into the ' dead beginnings of things.'

    This at least is certain, that, being aware of former operations requiring

to be well understood before we can draw conclusions as to other facts
related to the unknown operations, one writes to no purpose in affirming

conclusions without such preliminary knowledge.
    Thus, the changing level of the land part of the earth's crust, throughout

geological time, leads to the recognition of the present shape and size of con-
tinents and islands as being recent and temporary.

  We feel that there have been phenomena attending, for example, the actual

flow of continuous ocean between Ireland and Newfoundland, the nature
and succession of which should be known in order to enable us to compre-
hend the causes or conditions of the present diflTerences between the Flora
and Fauna of those islands respectively : and so of every other part of dry

land now circumscribed by sea.

    All affirmations as to the time, place, and kind of origin of the organisms
of a so circumscribed land, in the absence of a knowledge of the causes and
conditions of such circumscription, must be guess-work.
ADDRESS.  XCl

    It is a part of sound knowledge to be able to recognize the subjects re-
garding which we have not, at present, the basis of true assertion.

   On the few occasions in which I have been led to offer observations on

the probable cause of the extinction of specie.*, the chief weight has been
given to those gradual changes in the conditions of a country affecting the
due supply in sustenance to animals in a state of nature, I have also pointed
out the characters in the animals themselves calculated to render them most
obnoxious to such extirpating influences; and on one occasion* I have ap-

plied the remarlis to the explanation of so many of the larger species of par-
ticular groups of animals having become extinct, whilst smaller species of

equal antiquity have remained.
    In proportion to its bulk is the dificulty of the contest which, as a living

organized whole, tiie individual of such species has to maintain against tlie
surrounding agencies that are ever lending to dissolve the vital bond and
subjugate the living matter to the ordinary chemical and physical forces.

Any changes, therefore, in such external agencies as a species may have

been originally adapted to exist in will militate against that existence in a
degree proportionate, perhaps in a geometrical ratio, to the bulk of the

species. If a dry season be gradually prolonged, the large mammal will

suffer from the drought sooner than the small one ; if such alteration of
climate affect the quantity of vegetable food, the bulky Herbivore will first

feel the effects of stinted nourishment; if new enemies are introduced, the

large and conspicuous quadruped or bird will fall a prey, whilst the smaller
species conceal themselves and escape. Smaller animals are usually, also,
more prolific than larger ones.

   " The actual presence, therefore, of small species of animals in countries
where larger s[)ecies of the same natural families formerly exisied, is not the

consequence of any gradual diminution of the size of such species, but is the

result of circumstances, which may be illustrated by the fable of the ' Oak

and the Reed ;' the smaller and feebler animals have bent and accommodated
themselves to changes which have destroyed the larger species."

    Accepting this explanation of the extirpation of species as true, Mr.
Wallace f has recently applied it to the extirpation of varieties ; and, assu-
ming, as is probable, that varieties do arise in a wild species, he shows how
such deviations from type may either tend to the destruction of a variety, or
to adapt a variety to some changes in surrounding conditions, under which
it is better calculated to exist, than the type-form from which it deviated.

   No doubt the type-form of any species is that which is best adapted to

the conditions under which such species at the time exists ; and as long as
those conditions remain unchanged, so long will the type remain ; all
varieties departing therefrom being in the same ratio less adapted to the
environing conditions of existence. But, if those conditions change, then

the variety of the species at an antecedent date and state of things will
 become the type-form of the species at a later date, and in an altered state
of things.

    Mr. Charles Darwin had previously to Mr. Wallace illustrated this prin-

--ciple by ingenious suppositions, of which I select the following : " To give

--an imaginary example from changes in progress on an island : let the

organization of a canine animal which preyed chiefly on rabbits, but some-
times on hares, become slightly plastic ; let these same changes cause the

number of rabbits very slowly to decrease, and the number of hares to in-
crease ; the effect of this would be that the fox or dog would be driven to
try to catch more hares : his organization, however, being slightly plastic,
those individuals with the lightest forms, longest limbs, and best eyesight,
let the difference be ever so small, would be slightly favoured, and would
tend to live longer, and to survive during that time of the year when food
was scarcest; they would also rear more young, which would tend to
inherit these slight peculiarities. The less fleet ones would be rigidly
destroyed. I can see no more reason to doubt that these causes in a thou-
sand generations would produce a marked effect, and adapt the form of the
fox or dog to the catching of hares instead of rabbits, than that greyhounds
can be improved by selection and careful breeding*."

   Observation of animals in a state of nature is required to show their
degree of plasticity, or the extent to which varieties do arise: whereby
grounds may be had for judging of the probability of the elastic ligaments
and joint-structures of a feline foot, for example, being superinduced upon
the more simple structure of the toe with the non-retractile claw, according

to the principle of a succession of varieties in timef.

   Observation of fossil remains is also still needed to make known the ante-

types, in which varieties, analogous to the observed ones in existing species,
might have occurred, so as to give rise ultimately to such extreme forms as
the Giraffe for example^.

   This application of paleontology has always been felt by myself to be so
important that I have never omitted a proper opportunity for impressing the
results of observations showing the " more generalized structures " of extinct
as compared with recent forms of mammalia.

   But, in pointing out how local changes might affect large quadrupeds, I

The aboriginal laws of geographical distribution of plants and animals

have been modified from of old by geological and the concomitant climatal

changes; but they have been much more disturbed by man since his intro-

duction upon the globe.

The serviceable plants and animals which he has carried with him in his

migrations have flourished and multiplied in lands the most remote from the

habitats of the aboriginal species. Man has, also, been the most potent and

intelligible cause of the extirpation of species within historic times.

  -- --He alone, with one of the beasts which he has domesticated the dog is

truly cosmopolitan. The human species is represented by a few well-marked
varieties ; and there is a certain amount of correspondence between their

localities and general zoological provinces : thus the Australian variety of

man is as well-marked and circumscribed as the Australian fauna generally
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the Papuans of New Guinea present the same difference from, with degree

of affinity to, the Australians, as we find in comparing the respective faunae
of Papua and Australia. But, with regard to the alleged conformity between
the geographical distribution of man and animals, which has of late been
systematically enunciated, and made the basis of deductions as to the origin
and distinction of the human varieties, I would submit the following remarks

as affecting the system referred to*.
    Using Blumenbach's term in the sense of the later terms 'Indo-European*

and ' Aryan,' we find the ' Caucasian ' race extended from Iceland to the
mouth of the Ganges. There is no corresponding distinction in the animals
and plants of the Europseo-Asiatic continent, which is bisected by the ob-
lique line dividing the Mongolian from the Caucasian varieties of mankind.
The Persian fauna extends into Tartary ; the Himalayan into Thibet.

   As two primary varieties of mankind exist in one great zoological province

in the Old World, so a third great variety extends over at least two zoolo-

gical provinces in the New World. All authors divide the North American

or ' Nearctic ' from the South American or ' Neotropic ' region, whatever
class of organic life they may treat of geographically ; but the red or
copper-coloured American is the same, physically and linguistically, to the

extent of the characteristics of a primary race, from the 60th degree of
north latitude to the 53rd degree of south latitude.

   The Lapps of Arctic Europe differ linguistically and physically, as a race,
from the Norwegians and Swedes : the zoological province is essentially one.
As such it extends over the same parallels of latitude in America, where the
Mongolian Esquimaux and the American Chippawas inhabit.

The Hottentots and Caffres are more distinct, linguistically and physically,

than  the  former  are  from  equatorial  Negroes,  or  the  latter  from  the    Nubians
                                                                                                                              ;

yet they both inhabit one well-marked zoological province, Soutii Africa.

 -- --Two varieties of mankind the Papuan and Malayan inhabit Borneo

and other islands at the eastern part of the Indian Archipelago; these
islands forming one and the same zoological and botanical province.

Not less than twenty colours have been found requisite to indicate in a

map of the British Islands the different varieties and sub-varieties of the

human race that have contributed to its miscellaneous population.

   Other facts of the same kind might be cited, affecting the conformity of

the distribution of man with that of the lower animals and plants, as abso-
lutely enunciated in some recent works. Nor can we be surprised to find
that the migratory instincts of the human species, with the peculiar endow-
ment of adaptiveness to all climates, should have produced modifications

in geographical distribution to Avhich the lower forms of living nature have

not been subject. It is only since man began to exercise his privilege and

power, that the geographical laws in regard to the lower animals of existing

species have begun to be blotted out.

Ethnology is a wide and fertile subject, and I should be led far beyond

the limits of an inaugural discourse were I to indulge in an historical sketch

of its progress. But I may advert to the uniform testimony of different

-- --witnesses to the concurrence of distinct species of evidence as to the

much higher antiquity of the human race, than has been assigned it in

historical and genealogical records.

Mr. Leonard Horner sagaciously discerned the value of the phenomena of

the annual sedimentary deposits of the Nile in Egypt as a test of the lapse
of time during which that most recent and still operating geological dynamic
had been in progress. In two memoirs communicated to the Royal Society

in 1855 and 1858, the results of ninety- five vertical borings through the

alluvium thus formed are recorded.

The Nile sediment at the lowest depth reached is very similar in composi-

tion to that of the present day. In the lowest part of the boring of the sedi-

ment at the colossal statue in Memphis, at a depth of 39 feet from the sur-

face of the ground, the boring-instrument is reported to have brought up a

piece of pottery. This Mr. Horner infers to be a record of the existence

of man 13,371 years before a.d. 1854; "of man, moreover, in a state of

civilization, so far, at least, as to be able to fashion clay into vessels, and to

know how to harden them by the action of a strong heat*."

  Prof. Max Mvillerf has opened out a similar vista into the remote past

of the history of the human race by the perception and application of

analogies in ihe formation of modern and ancient, of living and dead lan-

guages.

ADDRESS.  XCV

   From the relations traceable between the six Romance dialects, Italian,

Wallachian, Rhcetian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French, an antecedent com-

mon ' mother-tongue ' might be inferred, and consequently the existence of

a race anterior to the modern Italians, Spanish, French, cSrc, with conclusions
as to the lapse of time requisite for such divisions and migrations of the pri-
mitive stock, and for the modifications which the mother-language had

undergone. History and preserved writings show that such common
mother-race and language have existed in the Roman people and the Latin

tongue.
    But Latin, like the equally ' dead ' language Greek, with Sanscrit, Lithu-

anian, Zend, and the Gothic, Slavonic, and Celtic tongues, can be similarly

shown to be modifications of one antecedent common language; whence is to

be inferred an antecedent race of men, and a lapse of time sufficient for their
migration over a track extending from Iceland in the north-west to India in
the south-east, and for all the above-named modifications to have been esta-

blished in the common mother ' Arian ' tongue.

   The study of the animal kingdom has its practical results of national im-
portance in relation to sources of food and beasts of traction and burden.
Acts of Parliament relating to Fisheries, in order to realize their aims, must
be based on physiological and zoological data. Animal physiology, the most
important ground of successful medicine and surgery, is closely bound up

with the right progress of zoology, of which, indeed, with zootomy, it is a

branch. The great instrument of zoological science, as Lord Bacon points

out, is a Museum of Natural History.
   Every civilized state in Europe possesses such a Museum. That of Eng-

land has been progressively developed to the extent which the restrictive

circumstances under which it originated have allowed. The public is now
fully aware, by the reports that have been published by Parliament, by re-

presentations to Government, and by articles in Reviews and other Periodi-

cals, of the present condition of the National Museum of Natural History

and of its most pressing requirements.

   Of them the most pressing, and the one essential to rendering the collec-
tions worthy of this great empire, is ' space.' Our colonies include parts of
the earth where the forms of plants and animals are the most strange. No

 empire in the world had ever so wide a range for the collection of the various

forms of animal life as Great Britain. Never was there so much energy and
 intelligence displayed in the capture and transmission of exotic animals by the
enterprising traveller in unknown lands and by the hardy settler in remote
 colonies, as by those who start from their native shores of Britain. Foreign

 Naturalists consequently visit England anticipating to find in her capital and

 in her National Museum the richest and most varied materials for their com-
parisons and deductions. And they ought to be in a state pre-eminently

 conducive to the advancement of a philosophical zoology, and on a scale

commensurate with the greatness of the nation and the peculiar national

facilities for such perfection.

    But, in order to receive and to display zoological specimens, space must be

had                    and  not  merely                   space  for display,  but  for  orderly  display :  the  galleries
                    ;

should bear relation in size and form with the nature of the classes respect-

ively occupying them. They should be such "as to enable the student or

intelligent visitor to discern the extent of the class, and to trace the kind and

order of the variations wliich have been superinduced upon its common or
fundamental characters," In the British Museum one gallery permits this to

be done in regard to the class of Birds. " To show how the mammalian type

is progressively modified and raised from the form of tlie fish or lizard

into another; to impart to the visitor, by the arts of arrangement and juxta-

position, a knowledge of his own class akiu to that which he derives

from the collection of birds, would require a corresponding Mammalian

Gallery*^"

    The same is to be said of the classes of Reptiles and Fishes, and of the

Molluscous, Articulate, and Radiate Provinces.

   An osteological collection is as indispensable to the illustration of the Ver-

tebrata as a conchological one is to that of the Mollusca. Nor should the

size of any of the skeletons be a bar to the obtainment of adequate space for

the Osteological Collection in the National Museum of Natural History.
The very fact of the Wliales being the largest animals that now exist, or

have at any period lived upon the earth, is that which makes it more

imperative to illustrate the fact and gratify the natural interest of the public
by the adequate and convenient exhibition of their skeletons.

    In like manner, in the Palseontological collections or galleries of Fossil

remains, the restoration of every extinct species, however bulky, should be

carried out where practicable.

    The locality of such adequately-sized Museum concerns the administrator

and the public convenience. Reasons for its association with Ethnological

Antiquities and the National Library have been assigned in a memorial to

H. M. Government, and by the Deputation of cultivators of Science to tiie

Chancellor of the Exchequer, and these reasons have been commented on in
a late Number of the 'Quarterly Review.'

   I am most concerned in advocating the pressing necessity of adequate space
for the National Museum of Natural History, wherever administrative wisdom
may see fit to locate it. And, wherever that Museum may ultimately stand,

it is the duty of the Representative of Associated British Science here to

urge that the Curator of each class of animals should have assigned to him

the charge of delivering a public course of lectures on the characters, prin-

ciples of classification, habits, instincts, and economical uses of such class.

       ADDRESS.     XCVll

   --The most elaborate and beautiful of created things those manifesting
 -- --life have much to teach much that comes home to the business of man,

  and also to the highest elements of his moral nature. The nation that
  gathers together thousands of corals, shells, insects, fishes, birds, and beasts,
  and votes the requisite funds for preparing, preserving, housing and arran-

  ging them, derives the smallest possible return for the outlay by merely gazing
 and wondering at the manifold varietj' and strangeness of such specimens of
  Natural History.

     The simplest coral and the meanest insect may have something in its
 history worth knowing, and in some way profitable. Every organism is a
 character in which Divine wisdom is written, and which ought to be
 expounded. Our present system of opening the book of Nature to the
 masses, as in the Galleries of the British Museum, without any provision for
 expounding her language, is akin to that which keeps the book of God sealed

 to the multitude in a dead tongue.

    Finally, in reference to a National Museum of Natural History, I would

 respectfully solicit the attention of the Administrator to the successful
working and unprecedented progress of the National Botanical Esta-

blishment at Kew, of the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street,
and of the Museum of Practical Art at South Kensington, in reference to

the relations of the eminent Directors of those establishments to Govern-
ment. For this opens the question, whether in the event of acquiring, in

whatever locality, the element essential to a National Museum of Natural

-- --History space any intermediate organization, unknown in the public esta-

blishments above cited, be really needed in the case of Natural History, in
order to afford Parliament and the public the requisite guarantee of the
good condition of the Collections, and the efficient discharge of the duties

and functions of the National Museum of Natural History.
   The sciences promoted by the statistical Section F., although bearing more

immediately than any others on the prosperity of nations and the well-being

of mankind, had no existence in the time of Bacon.

  We look in vain for any evidence, for example, of a clear conception of

Sanitary Science, or the doctrines preventive of disease, in the writings of

that great philosopher and politician. The only approach to Statistics which

we find in the ' Historia Vitse et Mortis,' for example, is a collection of in-

stances of longevity ; and the main aim of that Essay seems to have been the

extreme prolongation of particular or individual life, not the insurance of

average longevity to the species. Some remarks on the advantage of pure

air are congenial with the aims of the modern sanitary philosopher ; but he

finds no evidence of Bacon's conception- of its importance to the masses,

or of the means of ensuring it to populous cities, for prevention of plague

and pestilence. Sanitary science, as a great power for mankind, in the

Baconian sense, is of very recent growth : and, whether we consider the pre-

sent evidence of its potency where it has been rightly applied, or the present

xcviii  --REPORT 1858.

evidence of the miserable results of its neglect, we must be stimulated to use
every effort to promote its progress and impress its importance on all who
may aid therein.

   Long after Lord Bacon's day, the plague, the fever of the * black assize,'

and the like visitations, which drove Courts and Parliaments and Royal
Societies from town to country, were met only by rude quarantine imprison-

ments of the si(!k, which greatly aggravated the sum of mortality. Acci-
dents, such as the fire of London, subliming much old and vested filth, and

followed by wider streets and better dwellings, produced results which
opened the eyes of a few thinkers to the relation between certain physical
conditions and the non-return of the plague.

    Now, however, these relations have been comprehensively investigated ; the
diseases produced or aggravated by preventible conditions are well known ;
the most efficient and economical modes of prevention have been the subject
of successful and convincing experiment. But men are slow to act where
the profitable result is not direct. Health, we call, with cuckoo-cry, the

greatest blessing ; but practically it is daily sacrificed to ambition, wealth,
pleasure, and a hundred aims in which duty takes no necessary part. That,
however, is an affair of individual free-will with which abstract science has
no business.

    But in reference to inevitable aggregates of mankind, the nation is con-
cerned in the science which seeks their especial bodily well-being. Fleets,
armies, manufactories, workshops, the localities in towns where wage-people*

--congregate, such are conditions of citizens in which it behoves the State,

to the utmost constitutional extent of its power, to apply the ascertained
means of preventing disease and death.

    Perhaps the most exemplary instances of the value and economy of
sanitary science are afforded by the records of the British Navy, especially
since the period of Capt. Cook, whose name, were I to select one, as a prime
promoter of the science, would be that which I should adduce with highest
veneration. Some of the Arctic Expeditions, also, illustrate in an exemplary
degree the value of preventive measures in maintaining health under difficult
and depressing circumstances.

    Our armies have yet to receive the benefit of what is now known in the
prevention of death by disease. To what extent they have to benefit by it
has been made plain by the results of recent investigations, in which
the testimony of Florence Nightingale shines forth as the beacon which

 lights to better measures.

   * I venture to propose this term as free from the objections that have been made to
" lower orders," " humbler classes," " poorer classes," " working classes," " labouring popu-
lation," &c. The two former are a reflection on those who are so designated; and the two
latter are an implied reflection on all other classes, as if left to a life of vacant inoccupation.
They are injuriously misleading terms. The true specific character of the great class in
question is seen by the Naturalist to be " payment by wages" ; it is the " wage-class."
                                       ADDRESS.                            XCIX

   The results of the labours of the Sanitary Commissioners in the Crimea,
although the application of their preventive science was an after-thought,
and late, must have convinced the most sceptical of military men of its
importance. It became one of the elements of the ultimately superior con-

dition of the English part of the Allied army*.

  How large a proportion of loss in the French force was due to the absence

of neglect of preventive measures, we learn from the recent ' Relation Medico-
chirurgicale dela Campagne d'Orient ' of M. Scrlve, the head of the Medical
Department of the French army during that campaign ; and from the admi-
rable paper on the same subject by Dr. Gavin Milroy, Member of
the Sanitary Commission to the British Army in the East. To cite our

neighbour's case, in which the organization of the land-service has a high
repute, out of a force which averaged during a period of twenty months

104,000, upwards of 193,000 men were sent into hospital, i.e. at the rate of
from 9000 to 10,000 per month. About one-fifth of these admissions were
from M'ounds and mechanical injuries; the rest were from disease. The

deaths in the hospitals at Constantinople amounted to 28,000; elsewhere,
as in the camp and the field-ambulances, the deaths were 28,400, exclusive

of 7500 slain in action. Of the 28,400 deaths under treatment, about
4000, or a seventh part of the whole, arose from gun-shot wounds and
accidents, the other six-sevenths being the result of disease. The official

returns give a total loss from all causes during the whole Crimean campaign

of 70,000 : it is believed to have exceeded that figure by 10,000. 65,000
men, out of 309,268, sent from France and Algeria, were invalided in con-
sequence of disablement from wounds or the effect of disease.

   Dr. Scrive points out that, if the buildings at Gallipoli had been inspected

* These results cannot be better stated than in the words of Miss Nightingale, in an ap-

peal for the organization of a preventive administration, founded on the sanitary history of

the Crimean campaign.

 -- --" It is," she says, " a complete example history does not afford its equal of an army,

after a great disaster arising from neglect, having been brought into the highest state of

health and efficiency. It is the whole experiment on a colossal scale. In all other examples,

Wethe last step has been wanting to complete the solution of the problem.  had, in the

first seven months of the Crimean campaign, a mortality among the troops of 60 per cent.

--per annum, from disease alone, a rate of mortality which exceeds that of the great plague

of London, and a higher ratio than the mortality of the cholera to the attacks ; that is to

say, there died out of the army in the Crimea an annual rate greater than ordinarily die in

Wetime of pestilence out of the sick.  had, during the last six months of the war, a mor-

tality among our sick not much more than among our healthy Guards at home ; and a mor-
tality among our troops, in the last five months, two-thirds only of what it is among our

troops at home. The mortality among the troops of the line at home, when corrected, as it

ought to be, according to the proportion of different ages in the service, has been, on an

average often years, 187 per 1000 per annum, and among the Guards, 20-4 per 1000 per

annum. Comparing this with the Crimean mortality, for the last six months of our occu-

pation, we find that the deaths to admissions were 24 per 1000 per annum ; and during the

last five months, viz. January to May 1850, the mortality among the troops did not exceed

11'5 per 1000 per annum. Is not this the most complete experiment in army hygiene?"

and made fit for the purpose before they were occupied as an hospital, a
regiment of active young soldiers might have been saved.

   At Varna, a Turkish barrack witliin the walls was prematurely occupied as
an hospital : it had to be abandoned after great loss of life. Fewer men fell

in the unsuccessful attack upon the Malakoif on the 18th of June than suc-
cumbed in the rasii attempt to use, as an hospital, a place which had not been

previously fitted for one. And the time and labour required by the Sanitary

Inspector to effect their fitness are as nothing compared with the prelimi-
nary approaches to the Malakoff", and with the delay and impediments caused
by the prostration of a large proportion of effective force by disease.

    Without consulting the medical staff, it was determined to move from
Varna to the notoriously malarial region on the south of the Danube,

called the Dobrudscha. On the 20th of July the first division of the army
moved from Varna; on the 26th the cholera broke out. Hundreds of men

were struck down at once, and died within a few hours after being seized
in one regiment 300 men were attacked within twenty-four hours, and
most of them died on the spot. Appalled by the blow, the commanding
officer retreated, as from before an overwhelming force ; but, ere he could
reach the healthier locality, one-third of the division had perished, and num-

bers reached the coast only to expire on the beach.

   No enemy had been encountered save that one, of whose power and pre-
sence sanitary science had in vain forewarned the commander. On the

return of the first division to Varna, a force of 12,000 had been reduced
to 7000; the victims including two general officers and seven medical

officers.

   Not to weary by other special instances of the effect of neglecting pre-
ventive preparatory sanitary measures, I may sura up by the statement that
one pestilence, in the marshes of the Danube, within two months, out of an
army 55,000 strong, and before a shot had been fired, had destroyed as many
men as were slain by the enemy in the field during the twelve months from
the landing in the Crimea to the capture of Sebastopol, and when the
army averaged double the above number of men.

    That this pestilence, or its fatal effects, might have been, in an important
degree, prevented by practicable applications of sanitary science is the convic-
tion of the ablest medical officers of the French and English armies ; and

this conviction was substantiated by the results of the Sanitary Com-

mission which operated in the English lines before Sebastopol. These au-
thorities concur in the conclusion that three-fourths of the losses of an army
in the field are not from the enemy or from unavoidable casualties of service,

·' but from diseases which are more or less under control." " Of these,"

writes Dr. Milroy, " typhus and scurvy are two of the most formidable, and
the most easily preventible. They are the inevitable products of certain

well-ascertained conditions, and they may be generated at will as surely as
any salt or other compound may be formed by the chemist in his laboratory.

And yet it was these very evils which but two years ago brought the noble

army of a mighty nation, at the close, too, of a glorious campaign, to almost

the verge of destruction."

   I may allude to one other point which sanitary science would suggest to

the administrator in reference to the clearly-ascertained effects of too little

pure air, and loo much foul air inspired continuously during a given

period.

   The skilled soldier being of a given value when landed liealthy and strong
in the Crimea or at Calcutta, query, whether it be more economical to carry

1000 in one ship, landing 500 sick, enfeebled, and prepared to fall into
and engender epidemics, or to carry the 1000 in two such ships, and land
them healthy and fit for action ? The same administrative question applies to

barracks and hospitals.

   One noble use and adequate application of so vast a triumph of naval

architecture as Mr. Scott Russell's ' Leviathan ' would be its carrying troops

in good condition as regards health, for which its capacity especially fits it.

   When authority becomes impressed with a conviction stimulating to action

of the importance of sanitary science, it will insist on the possession, by the

army medical officers, of the elements of that science as well as of the prin-

ciples of practice in the cases of disease and the treatment of wounds. But,

in order that an army may benefit by the doctors' knowledge of preven-

tive medicine, authority should direct preliminary examinations and reports

-- --of sites for encampment, of buildings for barracks and hospitals, of

clothes for extreme climates, and the like, and should command that such

reports be acted upon, where no urgent circumstances or inevitable move-

ments preclude the adoption of the means for the prevention of decimating

fevers and choleras.

Bonaparte's military science was characterized by the rapid concentration

Aof his forces upon a given point.  like success and superiority may attend

the commander who keeps the greatest proportion of his men in good work-

ing trim. The healthier the man the longer and quicker will he march. And

the care which foresees and provides for the efficient fighting order of a

force is quite compatible with the most intrepid handling of that force in the

field of battle.

   As to the dense populations in civil life, the number of towns in England
in which the sewage is rapidly, efficiently, and economically carried off by
water-power and hydraulic apparatus, constitute so many experimental

demonstrations of the success attending a proper unintermitting water-supply

and co-adjusted system of tubular drainage. Lancaster, Penrith, Alnwick,

Barnard Castle, Rugby, Croydon, Ely, are instances in which are demon-

--strated the diminution of fever and other causes of untimely death, the
--augmentation of the cleanliness and comfort of the wage-classes, the eco-

nomy in the wear of all washable articles through the supplies of pure water,

--collateral and unexpected economies in regard to fire-insurance, from the

power of rapid extinction of conflagration which the uuintermitting system

--affords, the purity of the atmosphere in formerly foetid courts and alleys,

these and other inestimable material advantages have resulted, and will result

with progressively increased benefit as time goes on.

 --Lord Bacon observes, in his suggestions for an inquiry into the causes of

death, " And this inquiry, we hope, might redound to a general good, if

physicians would but exert themselves and raise their minds above the sordid

considerations of cure; not deriving their honour from the necessities of

mankind, but becoming ministers to the Divine power and goodness both in

prolonging and restoring the life of                      man                    especially as  this may  be  effected
                                                                              ;

by safe, commodious, and not illiberal means, though hitherto uuattenipted.

And certainly it would be an earnest of Divine favour, if, whilst we are jour-

neying to the land of promise, our garments, these frail bodies of ours, were

not greatly to wear out in the wilderness of this world."

Amongst his special topics of inquiry are these :

" Inquire into the length and shortness of men's lives according to the

times, countries, climates, and places in which they were born and lived."
   " Inquire into the length and shortness of men's lives according to their

food, diet, manner of living, exercise, and the like. With regard to the air
in which they live and dwell, I consider that ought to be inquired into under

the former article concerning their places of abode."

   Now these inquiries have in our times been made chiefly in the form and

by the authority of Sanitary Commissions; in the successful working of

which the name of Edwin Chadwick stands foremost.

   By these commissions it has been shown, as a general result, that nearly

one-half the prevalent diseases are due to one or other form of atmospheric

impurity                                        impurity  from decomposing faecal or animal and vegetable matter,
                                             ;

within and without human habitations, and beneath the sites of towns, and

atmospheric impurity from over- crowding.

   For the prevention of the diseases arising from these causes, the sanitary-

physician must direct his requisitions not to the apothecary, but to the pro-
fessor of new arts, which are only partially created,--the art of the sanitarv
architect and the art of the sanitary engineer. The latter has already been

officially shown how he may collect water from natural and artificial springs,
convey it into houses unintermittingly fresh, and without stagnation, and by

its means remove from houses, through self-cleansing drains and self-clean-

sing sewers, constantly and before noxious decomposition can commence, all
faecal and waste animal and vegetable matter.

   In model dwellings, where the sanitary conditions have been as yet
applied only in a rudimentary manner, the death-rate has, in fact, been

steadily kept down to thirteen in a thousand, or much less than one-half
that which prevailed in London when Bacon lived, or little more than

one-half of the death-rate which prevails there now. In fact, it is proved
to be practicable to make those garments--the frail bodies of the popu-

--lation last full ten years, or probably one-third longer, in the wilderness

of this world.
    In our time physicians have ably exerted themselves in aid of the sanitary

engineer and administrator. Their general sentiments have been long ex-

--pressed in such terms as those of Dr. Willis of Kelso : " It is impossible to

avoid the conclusion that much more might still be accomplished could we

be induced to profit by a gradually extending knowledge, so as to found

upon it a more wisely directed practice. When man shall be brought to

acknowledge (as truth nmst finally constrain him to acknowledge) that it is
by his own hand, through his neglect of a few obvious rules, that the seeds
of disease are most lavishly sown witliin his frame, and diffused over com-
munities ; when he shall have required of medical science to occupy itself
rather with the prevention of maladies than with their cure ; when govern-
ments shall be induced to consider the preservation of a nation's health an
object as important as the promotion of its commerce or the maintenance of

its conquests, we may hope then to see the approach of those times when,
after a life spent almost witiiout sickness, we shall close the term of an un-

harassed existence by a peaceful euthanasia."

 --It is to the landlord, to the representative landlords and owners of habi-

--tations, in parliament, to whom exhortations are now required to be

addressed, to raise their minds above " the sordid considerations " of the ex-
penses of cure, that is, of the expenses of those sanitary works of combined
drainage and water-supply, which it is their province to provide.

    It is right, however, to state that advances in well-directed practical ap-
plications of sanitary science are advances in economy ; that two houses and

two towns may receive constant supplies of water at the expense formerly

incurred for supplying one on the intermittent system, with its stagnancy and
pollutions in house cisterns and large storage reservoirs. It remains for the
legislature and local administrations to make prevalent that which is proved
to be practicable for the public good, and to ensure that good at the econo-
mical rate at which particular instances afford demonstrations that it is

achievable.

   Agriculture has of late years made unusual progress in this country, and
much of that progress is due to the application of scientific principles ; chiefly
of those supplied by chemistry, in a less degree of zoology and physiology :
some minor help in regard to the more effectual abatement of noxious insects

has been had from entomology ; recent discoveries of the metamorphoses,
metagenesis, and the course and modes of transmission of internal parasites,
have afforded a rational explanation of some traditional precautionary rules
of herdsmen, in reference to the ' rot ' in sheep, from fluke-worms and hydatids
and more direct power of preventing epizootics will doubtless be obtained
from entozoology.

   Geology now teaches the precise nature and relations of soils, a knowledge

of great practical importance in guiding the drainer of land in the modifi-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             :

cations of his general rules of practice. Palaeontology has brought to light
unexpected sources of valuable manures, in phosphatic relics of ancient animal
life, accumulated in astounding masses in certain localities of England, as,
for instance, in the red-crag of Suffolk, and the greensands of Cambridge.

    But enormous quantities of azotic, ammoniacal, and phosphatic matters
are still suffered to run to waste ; and, as if to bring the wastefulness more
home to conviction, these products, so valuable when rightly administered,
become a source of annoyance, unremunerative outlay, and disease, when, as
at present in most towns, imperfectly and irrationally disposed of.

    For the most part, thought is taken only how to get rid of these pro-
ducts in the easiest and quickest way. The metropolitan authorities have
hitherto carried the chain of reasoning no further. They have turned them

into the Thames, the receptacle nearest at hand ; but in so doing have failed

in their prime intention. The metropolis is not even rid of its excreta ; but
they have returned upon it and accumulated, with increased noxious and

morbific power, on the strands of the valley that bisects it ; appealing, as is

notorious, summer after summer, to the very legislature itself, with uninter-

mitting and importunate odours, compelling the attention of the possessors
of lands and houses to this important subject.

   Now here I would beg leave to remark that, in the operations of Nature,

there is generally a succession of processes coordinated for a given result
a peach is not directly developed as such from its elements ; the seed would,
a priori, give no idea of the tree, nor the tree of the flower, nor the fertilized

germ of that flower of the pulpy fruit in which the seed is buried. It is
eminently characteristic of the Creative Wisdom, this far-seeing and prevision
of an ultimate result, through the successive operations of a coordinate series

of seemingly very different conditions.

   The further a man discerns, in a series of conditions, their cordinatlon to

--produce a given result, the nearer does his wisdom approach though the
--distance be still immeasurable to the Divine wisdom.

   One philanthropist builds a fever-hospital, another drains a town. One
crime-preventer hangs the man, another trains the boy. One financier
would raise money by augmenting a duty, or by a direct tax, and finds the re-

venue not increased in the expected ratio. Another diminishes a tax, or abo-
lishes a duty, and through foreseen consequences the revenue is improved.

    Quarantine exemplifies only the first step in the progress of thought, bearing
on the prevention of a dreaded distemper. It is a system which might keep
out contraband goods or uncertified strangers, but it is powerless against

the gaseous factors of plague, cholera, or yellow fever. No European

country suffers more from such maladies 'than Naples or Portugal, where
quarantine regulations are most stringent.

   Agriculture, let me repeat, has made and is making great and encouraging
progress. But much yet remains to be done. Were agriculture adequately
advanced, the great problem of the London sewage would be speedily solved.

                                            I
ADDRESS.  CV

Can it be supposed, if the rural districts about the metropolis were in a con-
dition to avail themselves of a daily supply of pipe-water not more than
equivalent to that which a heavy shower of rain throws down on 2000 acres
of land, but a supply charged with 30 tons of nitrogenous ammoniacal prin-
ciples, that such supply would not be forthcoming, and made capable of
being distributed when called for within a radius of 100 miles? I believe
that, were the call made as loudly as it undoubtedly would be under the
exigencies of a more advanced stage of agricultural mechanics, the skill of
our engineers, with the constructive powers of our machine-makers, both
carried to a degree of perfection which the world never before saw, would
speedily and successfully meet the call, and leave nothing but the rainfall of

--the metropolis to seek its natural receptacle the Thames.

   To send ships for foreign ammoniacal or phosphatic excreta to the coast
of Peru, and to pollute by the waste of similar home products the noble

river bisecting the metropolis, and washing the very walls of our Houses of
Parliament, are flagrant signs of the desert and uncultivated state of a field
where science and practice have still to cooperate for the public benefit.

   To promote this cooperation, effectual aid may be given by a recently

establisjjed kindred Association, through the advancement of the legislative
and administrative sciences. For it is the present condition of those social
sciences which forms the chief obstacle to the practical application of

Sanitary science. Of this science, it may be confidently averred that, be-

sides providing means for the relief of town-populations from excessive
sickness, it has, in a sufficient number of instances, provided means for the
prevention of the pollution of rivers as well as for applying the manure of
towns to fertilize the land.

   The application of those means now rests with the Legislator and Ad-

ministrator, and involves questions which are not within the province of

the British Association*.

 --Some of our sciences are deeply concerned in one progressive step, the

uniformity of standard in measure and weight throughout the civilized

world ; in urging on which step, energetic and unwearied efforts are now
being made by a Committee of our fellow-labourers of the Royal Society of
Arts, amongst whom the name of the prime promoter of this and kindred
reforms, Mr. James Yates, deserves especial and honourable mention.

   Chemistry is more concerned in the uniform expression of the results of
her delicate balances amongst her cultivators of different countries: Natural
History is no less interested in the use, by all observers, of one and the same
scale for measuring, and of one set of terms for expressing the superficial
dimensions of her subjects. Practically, I may state that I have found the

   * Services on three successive Sanitary Commissions, on the First Consolidated Metro-

politan Sewers Commission, and at the Board of Health, have led me to enter at undue

length on Sanitary matters, and are pleaded in excuse.
OVi REPORT--^1858.

French metre, and its subdivisions down to the millimetre, adequate to give

all the needful data of this kind for comparison of superficial dimensions in

the varied and extensive range of objects to which my business and pursuits
have led me to pay attention. Of the hindrances to progress and incon-

--veniences of the ' foot,' the ' inch,' and its duodecimal parts or lines, rarely
--the same in any two countries, I have elsewhere spoken and argued.

   The whole subject of a uniform system of weights, measures, and current
coin, will occupy the attention of a section of the Association for the Advance-
ment of Social Science, which will meet at Liverpool shortly after the termi-
nation of the present Meeting. This is by no means the only point at which the
Natural and Social Sciences touch and react on each other with mutual
advantage. The proximity of the periods of the annual assemblage of the

promoters of these respective sciences, together with the occurrence of both,
this year, in the North of England, is favourable to the fruition of such
advantages, by facilitating attendance at both Associations : and in future
years, the conditions of time and place of meeting, making it easy for a

Member of the British Association to attend also the Association for Social

Science, and reciprocally, might, with a view to mutual advantage and
cooperation, be a subject worthy of the consideration of the respective Coun-

cils of those Bodies.

   In reference to the relations now subsisting between the State and
Science, my first duty is to express our grateful sense of such measure of

aid, cooperation, and countenance as has been allotted to Scientific Bodies,

Enterprises and Discoveries; more especially to acknowledge how highly we

prize the sentiments of the Sovereign towards our works and aims, mani-

fested by spontaneous tribute to successful scientific research, in honourable

Titles and Royal gifts, and above all, in the gracious expressions accom-

panying them, with which Her Majesty has been pleased to distinguish some

of our Body. Happy are we, under the present benignant Reign, to have,

in the Royal Consort, a Prince endowed with exemplary virtues, and with

such accomplishments in Science and Art as have enabled His Royal High-

ness effectually, and on some memorable occasions, in the most important

Wedegree, to promote the best interests of both.  rejoice, moreover, in the

prospect of being favoured at a future Meeting by the Presidency of the

Prince Consort; and that, ere long, this Association may give the oppor-

tunity for the delivery of another of those ' Addresses,' pregnant with

deep thought, good sense, and right feeling, which have placed the name

of Prince Albert high in the esteem of the Intellectual Classes, and have

engraven it deeply in the hearts of the humblest of Her Majesty's subjects.
   On the part of the State, sums continue to be voted in aid of the means

independently possessed by the British Museum and the Royal Society,

wliereby the Natural History Collections in the first are extended, and the

piore direct scientific alms of the latter Institution are advanced. The

ADDRESS.  evil

Botanical Gardens and Museum at Kew, and the Museum of Practical Geo-

logy in Jermyn Street, are examples of the National Policy in regard to
Science, of which we can hardly over-estimate the importance. Most highly
and gratefully also do we appreciate the cooperation of the ' Board of Trade
with our Meteorologists, by the recent formation of the Department for the
collection of meteorological observations made at sea.

   But not by words only would, or does. Science make return to Govern-
ments fostering and aiding her endeavours for the public weal. Every prac-
tical application of her discoveries tends to the same end as that which the

enlightened Statesman has in view.

   The steam-engine in its manifold applications, the crime-decreasing gas-

lamp, the lightning conductor, the electric telegraph, the law of storms and
rules for the mariner's guidance in them, the power of rendering surgical

operations painless, the measures for preserving public health and for pre-

--venting or mitigating epidemics, such are amongst the more important

practical results of pure scientific research with which mankind have been
blessed and States enriched. They are evidence unmistakeable of the close
affinity between the aims and tendencies of Science and those of true State
policy. In proportion to the activity, productivity, and prosperity of a com-

munity is its power of responding to the calls of the Finance Minister. By
a far-seeing one, the man of Science will be regarded with a favourable eye,

not less for the unlooked-for streams of wealth that have already flowed, but

for those that may in future arise, out of the applications of the abstract

truths to the discovery of which he devotes himself.
    This may, indeed, demand some measure of faith on the part of the prac-

tical Statesman. For who that watched the philosophic Black experimenting

on the abstract nature of Caloric could have foreseen that his discovery of latent
heat would be the stand -point of Watt's invention of a practically operative

steam engine ! How little could the observer of Oersted's subtle arrange-

ments for converting electric into magnetic force have dreamt of Wheat-

stone's application of such discovery to the rapid interchange of ideas now

daily practised between individuals in distant cities, countries, and continents !

    Some medical contemporaries of John Huntek, when they saw him, as
they thought, wasting as much time in studying the growth of a deer's horn

 as they would have bestowed upon the symptoms of their best patient, com-
 passionated, it is said, the singularity of his pursuits. But, by the insight so
gained into the rapid enlargement of arteries, Hunter learnt a property of
those vessels which emboldened him to experiment on a man with aneurism,
and so to introduce a new operation which has rescued from a lingering and
 painful death thousan Is of his fellow-creatures. Our great inductive physio-
 logist, in his dissections and experiments on the lower animals, was " taking
 light what may be wrought upon the body of man."

    The production of chloroform is amongst the more subtle experimental
 results of modern chemistry. The blessed effects of its proper exhibition in

the diminution of the sum of human agony are indescribable. But that
divine-like application was not present to the mind of the scientific chemist

who discovered the anaesthetic product, an}' more than was the gas-lit town
to the mind of Priestley or the condensing-engine to that of Black.

These unexpected applications of pure Science, fraught with such incal-

culable influences on the well-being of peoples, ought to weigh with the

Minister to whom may be submitted an enterprise in Science which only a

nation can undertake, or the considerations of a scientific establishment

which none but a nation can support. Much of the improvement in refined

machinery, and the tools for making it, grew out of the requirements and

teaching of Babbage during the construction of his Calculating Machines.
Such collateral result, alone, has made a manifold return for the sum granted

in aid of the realization of that philosopher's great idea. So rare a combi-

nation of analytic, inventive, and constructive faculties is seldom given to

man ; and the generation witnessing such a mind in operation would be wise

to secure the full result of its peculiarly directed energy.

In proportion to the facilities and rapidity of exchange and transit of

goods, of men, and of thought, trade and commerce expand ; and with their

expansion grow the receipts under the heads of Customs and Excise. Every

application of pure mathematics and astronomy to the making voyages safer

--and speedier, every observation by such instruments as the Establishment

Kewof the British Association at  perfects for their purpose, giving to the

mariner fore-knowledge of storms, and teaching him their course and lines

--of greatest intensity, becomes an important condition in enabling a country

to bear the burthen of taxation.

The steps in the series of this relation have been so plain that national

encouragement has long been given to Astronomy. As clear a perception

of the same relation and tendency of discoveries in Chemistry, Electricity,

WhyElectro-magnetism, and other sciences, led Herschel, long ago, to ask "

the direct assistance afforded by Governments to the execution of continued
series of observations should be confined to Astronomy? "

Faithfully is the State served by that Science. Most exemplary are

those observations made, and every astronomical duty bearing on the

interests of society, discharged, in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, the

good repute of which grows and spreads year by year under its present

indefatigable Chief. Year by year, almost, arises the necessity for some addi-

tional instrument to meet the ever-expanding relations and requirements of
Astronomy and Meteorology.

   But to make use of fitting instruments is one thing, to make them fit for
use another. To perfect that fitness and extend it to the instruments of all

observatories, to maintain a standard of excellence whereby comparison of

results shall be most productive of truth, are the special functions of our

kindred establishment at Kew. There, as in the mathematical and engine

houses of the ' New Atlantis,' we seek to render our instruments unrivalled
ADDRESS.  ClX

" for equality, fineness, and subtilty " of operation. No expense, time, or

pains have been spared by this Association to bring the exquisitely con-
structed and ingeniously adjusted mechanisms required to give us cognizance

of the operations of the mysterious influences pervading our earth and atmo-

sphere to their utmost attainable exactitude of performance.

   To prepare, to adjust, to test, verify, and rectify those instruments for the
use of voyagers and travellers are labours that have grown out of the im-

portant function of the ' Kew Observatory.'

   These labours have been cheerfully performed whenever and by whom-

soever required; as, recently, at the request of the Admiralty and Roj'al
Society in aid of the Commission for determining the Oregon Boundary, and
in the Second Expedition of Livingstone to the Zambesi. Not only have
philosophical instruments been prepared and constants determined, but the
voyagers have received, at Kew, practical instructions in their use.

    Tile reputation of the accuracy of the instruments at our establishment is

now such that requests are received from different Foreign States for a like
application of the resources which it commands. The United States, Russia,

--Austria, Portugal, the Papal States for the ' CoUegio Romano,' all have

testified, by such applications for the preparation and adjustment of philo-
sophical instruments, that the establishment, originated and organized by the

British Association, fulfils a national scientific want. Our ' Report ' this
year will show that the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, and other Home-
institutions give the same testimony.

    With the growth of its reputation and experience of its utility, the labours

carried on at Kew have necessarily multiplied ; and the expense of the esta-

blishment cannot be this year less than £800.

   Were the duties of the Kew Observatory superadded to those performed

at Greenwich, such expense would fall, in the ordinary course, upon the State.

Hitherto it has been borne by the British Association, and to that extent
cripples our power of lending the helping hand to other scientific work.

  We have to thank the Government for the use of the building at Kew.

   Such pecuniary aid as has been added to the sums allotted from our sub-
scriptions has been received from a kindred self-supporting Scientific Asso-
ciation. The Royal Society liberally voted the amount required for the
purchase of the "Whitworth's Lathe and Planing Machine," now doing
efficient work at the Observatory.

   In the late location, by liberal permission of the Government, of the Royal,
Linnaean, and Chemical Societies in contiguous apartments at Burlington
House, we hail the commencement of that organization, recommended by
the British Association at their first meeting, from which the most important
results of combination of present scattered powers, and of a system of intellec-

tual cooperation, may be confidently expected. " The combined advantages,

including at once the most powerful stimulus and the most efficient guidance

of scientific research," have appeared to an eminent member of our Body

" to be beyond calculation."
--PX REPORT 1858.

   No locality in the Metropolis unites so many elements of convenience for

such a concentration as Burlington House. If, to the application of other

Scientific Societies than the three now there located, the reply should be
given " that the State is not called upon to provide room for individuals who

may choose to combine for the enjoyment of a special intellectual pursuit,"

we may rejoin that such Associations seek no selfish profit, but impart tlie

Weresults of tlieir combined labour freely for the public weal.  might

urge that the small amount of support needed for the enterprises and

--establishment of Science, scarce equal to the product of the tax upon
--discovery and invention paid under the existing ' Patent Laws' would be a

good investment on the part of a Nation ; and that, viewing such establish-

ments and the prosecution of abstract physical truth in regard only to their
material results, these might assure a Minister disposed to invest in what

might seem to him the Lottery of Science, that the prizes are neither few

--nor small, nay, some are incalculably great.

   It now only remains for me to express how deeply I feel the honour con-
ferred on me by the position in which, through your kindness, I am now

placed ; how highly I esteem the opportunity afforded me of addressing so
distinguished and influential an audience in this most noble Hall ; and how

sincerely I thank you for the patience and favour with whicli you have

received this Address.

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

The present, Fourth, and probably last Report on Earthquakes that I sliall

have the honour of presenting to the British Association, has for its objects

the discussion of the great catalogue of earthquakes printed in several prece-

ding volumes of its ' Transactions,' the last portion of which only appeared in

type in 1855, and the completion, as far as possible, of the complement of the

other desiderata mentioned at the conclusion of the First Report (1850).
The pressure of other occupations, with some uncontrollable circumstances,

have delayed for nearly three years its appearance : the delay, however,

has not been without advantage; it has enabled me more fully to grasp

additional conditions and difficulties, before unnoticed, of some branches of

the subject, and to derive advantage from the contemporaneous labours of

the few physicists who are engaged in Seismology ; foremost amongst whom

stands M. Perrey of Dijon.

The reader will with advantage refer to the conclusions of the Second

Report (1851), as to the construction of the catalogue which constitutes

the Third (1854), before perusing the present ; as well as to the concluding

note of that Report, in which it is stated that the catalogue commencing at

1606 B.C., and originally proposed to be extended in its tabular form to the

end of 1850 a.d., was concluded at the end of the year 184-2, from which

period up to 1850, and indeed later still, the catalogues of Prof. Perrey

supply all that is needful, though it is to be regretted that they are not

tabulated for more convenient reference. But although the British Asso-

ciation Catalogue concludes with 184-2, the discussion of facts has been

extended to the end of 1850, the base of induction for the last eight years

being supported by the labours of Perrey.

   The whole base of induction therefore for such conclusions as are here

--to be attempted, embracing between 6000 and 7000 separate recorded earth-

--quakes over every known part of the globe, both on land and ocean, the
--character of the facts given, their scantiness as to information of .scientific
--value, the methods, or rather the want of all method, in their observation,
--and other causes, mentioned in the Second Report, I think justifv me in

stating my conviction, that nearly all that can be drawn from the collection

and discussion of such records has now been done, and that the labour of

collecting and calculating further and future Seismologues will be in a great

--degree thrown away, unless the cultivators of science of all countries, in

conjunction with the scientific bodies and the scientific departments of the

--chief civilized governments of the world, shall unite in agreeing to some

one uniform system of seismic observation, and record and transmit the results

periodically to a central bureau for discussion. What has been done for

astronomy and for terrestrial magnetism, is beginning to be done for meteor-
ology, and through the suggestive labours of Maury, Bache, and others,

for maritime discovery, ought to be done now for seismology, whose chief

requirements could be readily added to those already supposed to be system-

atized from Lieut. Maury's proposals, as well as to those long in course in

the astronomical, magnetic, and meteorological observatories of the world.

The spread of the net of telegraphic wires rapidly over the whole earth offers

facilities for the observation of earthquake phenomena, in which time always

Weenters as so important an element, never before possessed.                       shall revert

to this in treating of seismometry.

Before proceeding to the discussion of the British Association Catalogue,

I propose giving some account, in a connected form, of the discussions by

Professor Perrey, of his own local or partial catalogues, and of the conclusions

he has thence drawn ; as well as referring to some minor catalogues, more

or less completely discussed by their authors : amongst the latter, Mr. Milne's

valuable contributions escaped my notice when preparing my first report.

Perrey's labours in generalizing (as far, perhaps, as can from the data be

safely done) the facts of several great seismic kingdoms, and announcing

their results, form a valuable prelude to the still larger base of generalization

finally here discussed, and extending to the whole known globe. The dis-

cussed catalogue memoirs of Perrey, to which I have had access, apply to

the following localities :

   In the European Hemisphere
          The Scandinavian Peninsula and Iceland.
          The British Islands.
          The Spanish Peninsula.
           France, Belgium, and Holland.
          The Basin of the Rhone.
          The Basin of the Rhine.
          The Basin of the Danube.
          The Italian Peninsula.
           Algeria and Northern Africa.
          The Turco-Hellenic Peninsula, with Syria.

And in the American Hemisphere
          The Basin of the Atlantic.

           Canada and the United States.
           Mexico and Central America.
          The Antilles.
          Chili and La Plata.
          Cuba, by M. Poey.

   In addition to which, Perrey has combined and discussed together
            Europe, with the adjacent regions of Africa and of Asia.
          The North of Europe and of Asia

viewing the tliree continents in the light of two parallel Austral and Boreal

zones.

   The general method adopted by Perrey has been, after an introductory

physico-geographical sketch of the region, and the catalogue itself of earth-
quakes, to discuss them numerically and graphically.

And lastly, as to relative intensity, or dynamic value of the shock in each

direction, which he arrives at on the assumption that this, in any given

--given period, a supposition which although perhaps not without some value,

as admitting of one mode of regarding the relations of distant seismic regions

--not otherwise possible admits of the gravest doubt whether it have any

real natural basis.

  We shall consider the results in the order above. Near as Norway and

Sweden are topographically to the British Islands, it is not with these, but
with Iceland and the intervening band of the Northern Ocean that the
Scandinavian peninsula is in connexion as a seismic region ; very few ex-
amples occur of simultaneous action between the former ; but seldom has
there been any marked convulsion in Iceland without commotion in Nor-.
way, <Src., and vice versa. Scandinavia itself, one of the most remarkable
masses of land in slow process of elevation in the world, also shows its con-
nexion with internal action; and were it not that Iceland is pierced with
numberless vents, broken and shattered in every direction by volcanic
action, that admits of no cessation or consolidation above, there can be no
doubt that the destructive power of earthquakes would be manifested in the
northern peninsula to a far more serious extent and intensity.

    That Greenland, at least the east coast, and the Faroe Islands are. shaken

frequently, is highly probable, though I am not aware of any such record.
   The following is the result of Perrey's chronology of this region :

the great Scandinavian chain, and is in fact nearly a normal to the actually
observed directions of shock.

   It is a fact observed in many other seismic mountain chains, as well as

along the lines of great valleys and river-courses, that the main directions
of propagation of shock are along the lengths of the chains, valleys or river-

courses; and a very obvious explanation why this should frequently be the

case suggests itself, namely, that the solid materials of the earth are less

shattered and discontinuous, and more homogeneous in these directions
than in those transverse to the ranges and valleys, &c. ; but how far this is in
anyway connected in nature with Perrey's conclusion admits still of doubt;
and indeed it is manifest that any attempt to calculate a general or mean
resultant, from the horizontal component of shock only^ must be at least
incomplete, and, from other reasons that will be given when treating of
seismometric instruments, may be said to be at present impossible. I should
by no means wish, however, altogether to reject this ingenious method of
discussion in the present state of our knowledge.

from which, by the preceding method, Perrey computes a mean horizontal

direction of

              S. 39°5' W. toN. 39°5' E.,

which is about the line of direction of Loch Ness and of the Caledonian

Canal.

   This is certainly, however, not the general or mean horizontal direction

of British earthquakes, which appears to be one from south to north, veering
more or less to the east or west, but having on the whole a direction passing
through the probable focus of the Lisbon earthquakes and of the Canary

Islands. I am not aware that any attempt has been made to ascertain

the angle of emergence of the wave of shock for any British station, except

indirectly by myself, in my " Memoir on the British Earthquake of November

1852" (Trans. Roj'. Irish Acad. vol. xxii. part 1) at Dublin, which was from
25° to 30° inclined to the horizon ; and assuming the origin to have been
even somewhere between Great Britain and Lisbon, the depth of focus must
have been very great ; that earthquake extended over the greater portion

of the British Islands, the maximum disturbance on the surface being about

Shropshire.

    Mr. David Milne, in one of a series of very able papers on British earth-
quakes in the ' Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,' vols, xxxi.-xxxvi., which

I regret not having noticed in my Second Report as prominently as they

deserve, expresses his conviction (as it appears to me, however, from very

insufficient grounds) that all British earthquakes have had an origin of
disturbance immediately beneath Great Britain, and not at some distant

point beyond, his chief reasons being, 1, that with few exceptions they
affected only certain portions of the island; 2, that there was in all the
districts affected some spot where the concussion and attendant noise were
greater than anywhere else, and that they diminished with their distance

from this spot ; 3, that the shock and the noise moved simultaneously from

this spot.

   A reference to the Catalogue will show that these are by no means the

general prevailing facts : and if they had been so, they do not prove the
point, for reasons to be gathered from the Second Report. In the absence
of any knowledge of the angle of emergence, it is a very incomplete state-
ment of fact when Milne says, that " out of 110 shocks recorded in England,
31 originated in Wales, 31 along the south coast of England, 14 on the
borders of Yorkshire and Derbyshire, and 5 or 6 in Cumberland." " These
facts," he adds, " seem to show that the seat of action cannot be very far

down in the earth's interior." Locally variable surface-disturbance, and even

none at certain localities, within large areas exposed to seismic action, are

amongst the most common phenomena of observed earthquakes even of the

greatest extent and intensity, and arise, amongst other reasons, from the
heterogeneous and dislocated materials of the earth's crust perturbing the

Aelastic wave.  considerable numbei- of shocks, recorded in Scotland, have

been stated to have had a horizontal direction more or less from west to east;

and this is by no means incompatible with the general prevalent direction from

south to north already mentioned ; nor has it been unnoticed elsewhere, that

lono- ranges of hills of hard elastic rocks, with deep intervening valleys, change

the general horizontal course of the wave of shock reaching their flanks into
one mainly felt along the line of the chain. The little shocks for long

periods alrnost continuously felt in and about Corarie in Scotland, have all

had a general direction from west to east ; but these, like the similar phe-

nomena long carefully observed by Prof. Merian at Basle in Switzerland,

those at East Haddam in Massachusetts and elsewhere, I omit from consi-

deration here, as very doubtfully belonging to the class of earthquakes

proper at all, and perhaps no more than tremors, more or less forcible

at the surface, due to the fracturing of rocky masses below, by the gradual

processes of elevation or depression of the land. Excluding these, our

records, so far as they go, point to the south-to-north general direction

as given.

    Milne has discussed, with reference to period of the year, the circumstances
of 139 Scottish and 116 English earthquakes ; and the result squares pretty

closely with Perrey's.

   The following is Milne's Table :

   He notices also the fact, which we shall find has not escaped Perrey (' Me-

moir on France'), that the period of the year at which seismic action appears
to be greatest, is that when both the actual height of the barometric column
is the minimum, and the range of its oscillations the greatest in the year
and he has put with clearness the enormous total effect in the increase or
diminution of pressure over large areas, due to such changes in atmospheric
pressure, as a possible (he deems a certainly) connected cause in the j)roduc-
tion of earthquakes.

   Proceeding now to the Spanish Peninsula, comprehending all west of the

Pyrenees and the ocean washing the shores of Portugal, the Ibllowing are

Perrey's results :

action in the winter reversed, so that sliocks are more frequent in summer
tlian in winter, and those in summer and spring together are to those in
autumn and winter as 2 to 3, but the observed horizontal direction is dif-

ferent, being most usual in the main line of the chain.
   If tiiis be so, it would either be explicable as a case of deflected wave, like

that already mentioned with regard to the general north and south line in
Great Britain, becoming a south-west and north-east one in Scotland, the angle
of deflection in the present instance being small ; or it would indicate that
some of the shocks of the Pyrenees have connexion with the Mediterranean

seismic region.
    Spain, including Portugal, in its external configuration, with its vast

table-land of the two Castiles, rising nearly 2000 feet above the sea, is
perhaps the most interesting portion of Europe, not only in this respect,
but as a region of earthquake disturbance, where the energy and destroying
power of this agency have been more than once displayed upon the most
tremendous scale.

   It may be worth while to place here the tables of the progression of the

shocks of the two great Lisbon earthquakes of 1755 and 1761, as collected
by Milne (Edinburgh Phil. Journ. vol. xxxi.) from various sources,
although the chief result has been already discussed in the Second Report.
The time given in the Tables is reduced to Lisbon time ; the distances in
degrees of seventy miles English each.

   To this he not only, in the case of France, confesses that he does not
attach much weight, but also states that each century will not give the same

mean resultant.
   The actually observed districts of shock have been mainly along the

lines of the valleys of the Rhine and Rhone, and in an inferior degree along
those of the Loire, Seine, Garonne, and Meuse (the Pyrenees being
viewed as part of the Spanish region), the tendency being to a direction in

length of the valley, others across these. When the physical and geological

features of France and the Rhine basin are recalled, it can scarcely be

doubted that they constitute a natural independent seismic region, with

centres of disturbance connected probably at great depths with the extinct

volcanic countries of central France and of the Rhine. The almost continual
slight disturbances of St. INIaurienne, lasting for more than fifteen months at
one time, appear quite analogous to those of Comrie and East Haddam. For

the specialities of these and other questions of the French system, however,

the memoir itself of Perrey must be consulted.
   The basin of the Rhone has been consigned to a separate memoir. The

precise limits assigned to the district are not stated ; but we must assume

them to extend somewhat vaguely beyond the actual catchment of the

river. The results are given in

frequent and wide occasional departures from such direction ; and, indeed,
in the broken country forming a large portion of its length it is improbable
it should be otherwise.

  --The basin of the Danube. This vast tract of country has been left very

ill-defined as to its limits by Perrey, as respects the subject of his research.
His catalogue shows that he does not limit himself precisely to the catch-
ment of this mightiest of European rivers, but, in fact, includes something
like the whole of that vast tract of country between a line on the north,
reaching from Prague to Kherson ; and on the south, from Venice to Con-
stantinople, and even occasionally stretching beyond these limits.

ten times that of the basin of the Rhone ; and he justly concludes, that,
M'ere it not for the penury of records in those regions, so much of which
is semibarbarous or thinly inhabited, the total number in it would be far'

from which Perrey obtains a mean general horizontal direction of

W. 2° 39' N. to E. 2° 39' S.

   This is again very much the line of the Lower Danube itself, which, how-
ever, over so vast an area, and fed by vast rivers poured into it on the
northern side between great flanking ranges passing more or less north and
south, can in reality exercise little or no influence ; and too much stress
must not be laid upon any observation as to line of direction, even when the
azimuth surface may be reliable. This applies to every earthquake country;

uninstructed observers are very liable to mistake the direction of movement,
by confounding the direct effects of the shock with those due to inertia of
bodies moved. In the Danube basin, it must at present remain undecided
whereabouts the centre or centres of disturbance proper to the region are

to be found. On the north, the Carpathians probably are above the centre

for those whose horizontal direction is more or less north and south ; but
whether the shocks from east to west, and veering towards the north or
occasionally to the south, have their origin in the Caucasus, or beneath the
eastern extremity of the Euxine, or are also in connexion with the great
seismic energies that so powerfully and frequently display themselves in
Syria and the south-east, indeed all over Asia Minor, yet requires to be

investigated.

    In the region of the Italian Peninsula, Perrey includes the whole of Italy
and the mass of the Alps, exclusive of Savoy (which is included in the
basin of the Rhone), with Sicily, Malta, Sardinia, &c., reaching into the
centre of the Mediterranean Sea ; and, on the north, all the localities whose
watersheds are not into the Rhone, Rhine, or Danube. For the con-
ventional limits which Perrey has fixed for himself in deciding upon the
isolation in point of time of each distinct earthquake, often in this region

continuing for many days with little interruption, the memoir itself must be

consulted.

In the first of these, the winter and spring earthquakes together are to

the summer and autumn together

               as 6 : 5.

In the supplemental table taken alone, however, the winter season has lost

its preponderance, and autumn shows the smallest number.
   The number in winter and autumn together, however, still slightly ex-

ceeds that for spring and summer, in the ratio of 9 : 8.
   While this shows the usual doubtfulness of generalizations from partial data,

the result rather tends to awaken increased attention to the very prevalent
excess of seismic action in the winter half-year, shown by so many cata-
logues, and here sustained, though by a supplement, that, taken alone, some-
what departs from the principle.

and the mean general horizontal direction of resultant

                           S. 72° 27' E. to N. 72° 27' W.

Observation by no means accords with any such general mean direction. It
has repeatedly indicated movements in Italy and Sicily in every azimuth
perhaps with some greater prevalence of those from north to south, and the

reverse ; but the fact appears to be that these regions have their centre of dis-
turbance almost directly beneath, and hence, as is the case in Soutli America,
and the Moluccas, Philippines and Sunda Islands, the emergence of the wave
generally makes an extremely large angle with the horizon ; and the horizontal

component is ill-suited to easy observation. The most fearful earthquakes

with which this region has been visited, and whose force has reached
France, Germany, Holland, and England, and into Africa, are said to have
had a point within their immediate cincture where the shock was absolutely
vertical, as in the Riobambe earthquake recorded by Humboldt.

   The memoir of Perrey on Algiers and Northern Africa is brief; and he
laments that the want of information, and of access to sources of it not
attainable, prevented his collecting a sufficient number to found any ge-

--neralization upon. The following results alone he is able to tabulate :

--Table XIII. Earthquakes of Algeria and Northern Africa.

--IB REPORT 1858.

   The want of further liistoric information upon this region is much to be
regretted. It has been, since anything has been recorded of it, known as

subject to earthquakes. Cities, the sites of bishoprics in the ancient Christian

church of Africa, were thus demolished, and now astonisli the traveller
amidst rocky solitudes by acres of hewn stone on the sites of prostrate
edifices that mark the past magnificence of Carthaginian and Roman rule.

And at the present day, earthquakes are frequent and serious, as the many

edifices erected by the French since they have been in possession of Algeria,

and since thrown down, demonstrate.

Whether, as a seismic region, Northern Africa have a centre of dis-

turbance of its own, and if so, whether this exists deep within the little-

known recesses of the Atlas chain, or beneath the southern verge of the JVIe-

diterranean basin, or whether its disturbances are only derivative, and have

their centre either in the volcanic region of the Canaries or amongst the

towering peaks of Abyssinia, all yet remains to be discovered. No infor-

mation worthy of any confidence has reached me as to the general horizon-

Howtal direction of shocks in this region.        mucii to be desired is it, that

the government of the Emperor of the French would systematize seisnio-

scopic observations in their African possessions !

The last of Perrey's European series now comes before us ; and in the

following table he has given the results for

fewer than the known seismic character of the region warrants, and rightly
attributes this to want of record, and to the want of communication in tliese

parts of the world. He also remarks (what has been pointed out in the Second

Report as applying to Antioch, &c.) that here seismic energy appears to have
been in various localities extremely paroxysmal in its action, with long periods
of intermediate cessation. In the Turco-Greek peninsula, earthquakes have
long been both frequent and formidable.

   For the four critical periods of the year he finds

   Pouqueville (' Voyage en Grece') has given some very singular facts and

speculations as to the time of year of earthquakes in Epirus, &c., in re-

lation to the rains. They need inquiry and confirmation.
   In analysing the horizontal direction of shock, Perrey has deemed it

proper to separate the region under three sub-districts, in consequence of
the broken character of the Greek peninsula, and the very diverse orieiitation
of the coasts, river-courses, and mountain-ranges throughout all its parts.

the Cape de Verds, the West India Islands, and the great submarine volcanic
region first noticed by M. Daussy, besides many other points, as Ascension,
St. Helena, St. Paul's, &c., at which extinct volcanic phenomena are visible.
The number of observations, however, as yet recorded of earthquake-shocks
within the basin is so very small, that Perrey has been only able to collect from
130 to 140 instances between the years 1430 and 1847, or about three a
year on the average ; so that he does not deem the basis large enough to
warrant any numerical discussion. The observations of M. Daussy, " Sur

I'existence probable d'un volcan sousmarin situe par environ 0° 20' de lat.

S. et 22° 0' de Ion. ouest," published in vol. vi. p. 512, ' Comptes Rendus
de I'Academie' (1853), have, however, made this one of the most interesting

seismic regions on the globe.

   M. Moreau de Jonnes (' Comptes Rendus/ vol. vi. p. 302) has given two

recorded observations on board French ships, the ' Caesar' and the ' Syl-
phide,' which render the existence of a submarine volcanic tract on the bank

of Bahama highly probable ; but M. Daussy has collected and given obser-

vations of shocks received by vessels at sea at various periods, but all within
a given limited area, which renders the existence almost certain of a vast

active volcanic suboceanic area in the basin of the Atlantic, nearly midway
between Cape Palmas on the west coast of Africa, and Cape St. Roque on

the east coast of South America, or in the narrowest part of the ocean between

these continents. This vast disturbed and perhaps partially igneous ocean-

floor can be no less than nine degrees in length from west to east, and from

three to four degrees in breadth from north to south. The following are the
observations given by Daussy ; and the relative positions of the several

recording ships are given in the diagram (fig. A.) :

 possess enough, however, to indicate that a submarine volcanic tract is in
 activity beneath the Atlantic, as large in area as Great Britain, and that the
 bottom of the ocean there is rendered uneven in the extreme, immense

 protrusions taking place in deep water. How desirable would it be that

 some British ships were commissioned to examine this tract more perfectly,
 especially to obtain accurate soundings and sectional lines of the bottom
 from east to west and from north to south, and, if possible, to obtain, by
 dredging or otherwise, good specimens of the material of the bottom, and
 also observations of the temperature of the sea at various depths !

     Our knowledge of the distinguishing marks of suboceanic and subaerial

 volcanic ejecta, of the chemical reactions producing mineral species, under
 the conditions (so vaguely understood as yet) of high temperature and great
 pressure in presence of water, might receive important accessions, if such
 specimens from the bottom could be obtained from thence (or from other
 similar positions), while our ideas of the extent to which local ocean cur-

 rents may be produced and maintained by the local heating of the deep sea

  immediately above such volcanic tracts might be enlarged, and other trains

  of future research suggested.

     Above all, how forcibly does the existence (so far almost unnoticed and
  unknown) of this vast volcanic and seismic submarine region indicate the

  desirableness of having henceforth a well-arranged system of scientific ob-

  servation and mode of daily entry in the log-book made part of the duties

  of ships of every civilized maritime nation, and having such entries referred
  to a special office (with us, probably, in connexion with the Admiralty or
  with a revivified Board of Longitude) for extract, record, and discussion !

  That certain classes of observations could not be made on board our ships
  at present, although the zeal of our officers of the navy and of some of the

  mercantile marine might be counted on, is certain ; but it is equally so that

  very many of the highest value to cosmical science could be made and re-

  corded, if the system were once arranged, the classes of observation deter-
  mined on, properly ruled and arranged log-books prepared, and the making
  certain observations (to be determined on by the central board beforehand

  in each instance) made matter of duty. Navigation and commerce would

direction. It must not be forgotten, however, that, in 1812 and in ISIS,
shocks were observed at right angles to this, and in some cases, as in 1770,
in all azimuths ; and also that the prevalent opinion of the inhabitants of the
West Indian Islands is, that they have a general north and south horizontal
direction, thus coming within the scope of the general direction of similar
phenomena on the northern and southern continents of America.

   M. Poey, of the Observatory, Havanna, has published, in the ' Nouvelles
Annales des Voyages' for 1855, a memoir and supplement upon the earth-

quakes of Cuba, separately, with copies of which he has obligingly fur-

nished me. It would be out of place in this Report to discuss M. Poey's

views as to the connexion between cyclones, or other storms, and earth-

quakes, or as to the physical causes of the impulse producing shocks. As

regards the first, it may, however, be remarked in passing, that violent and
sudden local change of barometer-pressure must (as I have indicated in a
former report) be viewed as b. possible inducer of such reactions beneath the

surface as may possibly result in earthquakes; and that as respects the part
which water, under heat and pressure, may play in its sjiheroidal state, I
have also indicated fully as much as the present state of our knowledge will
sustain. As respects the statistic results of M. Poey's labours, they are
embraced in the following table, which combines the facts of both memoir

and supplement :

   In the last memoir-- that in which Perrey discusses the earthquakes of

--northern Europe and northern Asia together he expresses witli some

caution his own belief that the preponderance of seismic plienoniena in tlie
winter half-year above the summer half, in tiie ratio above given, is wortiiy
of acceptance as an empiric law for Europe at least, but doubts whether it
may be extended to tiie other hemisphere.

   The geographical limits of tliis seismic region are somewhat arbitrary,

reaching from the Elbe on the west to the extremity of Kamtschiitka on
the east ; bounded on the north, in Europe, by the Baltic and White Seas,
but in Asia reaching to the Arctic shores ; and on the south, in Europe, by
a great circle passing north of the Carpathian Mountains to the Euxine, the
Caucasus and the Caspian, and thence by the Desert of Gobi to the Sea of

--Okhotsk a va^t tract, containing many important mountain-chains, though

principally distinguished, as Perrey remarks, by its immense plains and low

table-lands.

   The eight following tables give not only his numerical I'esults for this

region, but a general comparative view of the numerical results of nearly
the whole of his memoirs, for which I have somewhat extended some of the

--32 REPORT 1858.

   There remains to be noticed, of M. Perrey's labours, his discussion of tlie

periodicitj- of the earthquakes of his annual catalogues for 1844, 1845,
1846, and 1847, with reference to the phases of the moon's motions, published

in 'Mem. de I'Academie des Sciences de Dijon,' 1848, 1849, part, des

Sciences, p. 105, &c., and also presented to the Institute of France at a

later period.

   The result he arrives at, as respects these four years, is, that the number of
earthquakes occurring at the Perigees (when the tides are highest and

--lowest) are, to those occurring at the Apogees, as 47 : 39, a conclusion

which, independently of the assumptions by which it is arrived at, must be
as yet accepted with caution upon so narrow a base of induction, although
possessing more than enough probability, from physical considerations, to

induce further inquiry.

   The Academy of Sciences (Paris) appointed a commission to report upon
M. Perrey's communication ; and the following translation of its report
(' Comptes Rendus,' tom. xxxviii. 12 Juin, 1854) will give a tolerably clear
notion of his views, which here rest upon a larger base than in his Memoir

as first published :

  " The Academy has commissioned us, MM. Liouville, Lame, and myself, to

draw up a report on a paper presented by M. Alexis Perrey, Professor in the
Faculty of Sciences at Dijon, on the 21st March 1853, 'On the Connexion
which may exist between the occurrence of Earthquakes and the Moon's
Age,' and on a note also presented by him on the 2nd January last, ' On

the occurrence of Earthquakes in connexion with the Moon's passing over

the Meridian.'

   " At the time of the presentation of the paper of March 1853, M. Arago
had been appointed a member of the commission. The lamented death of

our illustrious associate, since that date, left a vacant place in our commis-

sion ; and before the presentation of the note of the 2nd January 1854, M.
Lame was appointed to it.

    " M.Arago, whose attention nothing escaped which relates to the physics of
the globe, pursued with sustained interest the researches of INI. Alexis Perrey.

The Academy has not forgotten the care which he constantly took to draw

its attention to the notes which the learned Professor at Dijon addressed to
him from time to time within the last few years, in consequence of the in-

quiries he was engaged in on the subject of earthquakes. M. Arago made

particular mention, at several meetings, of the connexion which the author
had already traced between the occurrence of earthquakes and the moon's

age.

    " The cause of the interest which belongs to this subject is easily explained.

If, as is generally believed in the present day, the interior of the earth is,

owing to its high temperature, in a liquid or melted state, and if the globe
has but a comparatively thin solid crust, the interior, being deprived of
solidity, is compelled to yield, like the superficial mass of the ocean waters,
to the attractive force exercised by the sun and moon, and it acquires a
tendency to swell out in the direction of the rays of these two bodies; but
this tendency meets with a resistance in the rigidity of the solid crust, which
occasions shocks and fractures of the latter. The intensity of this force
varies, like the tides, according to the relative position of the sun and moon,
and consequently according to the moon's age ; and we must also observe
that as the tides ebb and flow twice in the course of a lunar day, at those
hours which agree with the passing of the moon over the meridian, so the
direction of the attraction exercised upon a point of the interior globe must
change twice a day, according as the point recedes or approaches the
ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OP EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 33

meridian, tiie plane of which passes through the centre of the moon. With-

out entering into longer details, we can easily conceive that, if the fusion of

the interior mass of the globe plays a part among the causes of earthquakes,

then its influence may become evident by a necessary connexion, capable of

observation, between the occurrence of earthquakes and the circumstances

which modify the moon's action upon the entire globe, or upon a portion of

it, namely, its angular distance from the sun, its real distance from the earth,

and its angular distance from the meridian of the place, or, in other words,

the moon's age, the time of perihelion, and the hour of the lunar day.

" These considerations, which occurred to M. A. Perrey, doubtless in-

spired him with the idea of the two works which we have been commis-

sioned to examine, at the same time that they assisted in attracting the

interest of M. Arago and many other learned men to the results which he

obtained ; but they also suggest that the essential object of the inquiries on

which we are commissioned to report ought to be, to ascertain the precise

date, according to the lunar day and month, of every earthquake the

record of which history has preserved, and even of each of the shocks

Weof which these earthquakes consisted.  can easily imagine the immense

toil which such a research would demand, and understand that M. Alexis

Perrey having already devoted several years to it without bringing it to a

termination, has yet been enabled at different intervals to obtain such par-

tial results as M. Arago deemed worthy of the encouragement and attention

of the Academy ; and that the learned Professor at Dijon is impatient, before
encountering the labours of still more years, to learn whether the Academy

approves of the course which he has hitherto pursued. The necessity the

author feels for the support and direction of the Academy explains why he

has, upon several occasions, submitted to it results which naturally could

not be complete, and which are not entirely so even in the paper and note

which we are commissioned to examine. In the paper presented on the
21st March 1853, 'On the Connexion which may exist between the occur-

rence of Earthquakes and the Moon's Age,' the author has devoted the first

chapter to the calculation and numerical changes of the rough results of

observation.

   " He has supposed four possible methods of calculation. In the first,
already followed in the memoir presented to the Academy May 5, 1847,

the author considers as a day of an earthquake each day upon which a

shock has been felt, whether in a single country, or in two or more coun-

tries at the same or at different hours, separated from each other by spaces

in which the motion was not experienced. Then noting, according to the

knowledge of the period, to which day of lunation each day of earthquake

corresponded, he arranges all the days which belong to the first day of

lunation, then all those which correspond to the second day, the third, the

fourth, &c. ; and he constructs a table composed of thirty lines, each line

indicating the number of earthquakes which belong to the corresponding day

of lunation. Now these numbers vary one day with another, and they vary

nearly in accordance with the same law, both in a table comprising a total

of 2735 days of earthquake, the result of researches carried on during the

years from 1801 to 184'5, drawn up by the author and presented to the

Academy May 5th, 1847; and in a new table containing a total of 5388

days of earthquake, embracing the result of extensive researches carried on
from 1801 to 1850.

" In both tables the number of earthquakes corresponding to the days

close to the Syzygies, is generally a little more considerable than that whicii

corresponds with the days close to the Quadratures. In the second method

1858.                                    D
--84 REPORT 1858.

of calculation,the author regards earthquakes experienced in different regions,
separated by regions where the shock is not perceptible, as distinct one from
the other, and reckons as an earthquake every percussion felt in a separated

region. This new method of calculation increases the number of earth-
quakes in the 1st table from 2735 to SO^l, and in the 2nd table from
5388 to 6596. The same law is again apparent in these two new tables,
and also in the four other tables which the author forms by dividing the
half century between 1800 and 1850 into two intervals, each of a quarter
of a century, and by successively applying the first and second methods
of calculation to the earthquakes of these two intervals.

    "In the third method of computation, M. Alexis Perrey regards every shock
of which an earthquake is composed as a distinct phenomenon, and registers

it separately ; but he does not possess the documents necessary for this plan,
because the number of shocks in each earthquake has not been accurately
noted. The author has hitherto contented himself with considering in this
manner the Table of 931 shocks felt in South America, chiefly in Arequipa,

published by M. Castelnau in the 5th volume of his ' Journey through the

Central Regions of South America.' This table, without leading to results
identical with those furnished by the other two methods, exhibits the fun-
damental relation already manifested. Lastly, in the fourth method of
computation, the application of which would often be very difficult, and

which has not yet been attempted by M. Alexis Perrey, we are to con-
sider as an unique phenomenon the number of shocks consecutively felt in

the same country during an interval preceded and followed in the same

country by periods of tranquillity.
   " To the nine tables formed by one or other of the three first methods of

computation the author has added a tenth, formed by the first method.
This only embraces four years, from 184'! to 1845, and contains but 422
days of earthquakes. In spite of this comparatively limited number, the
proportion of the figures appears the same. In all these tables we observe
a marked preponderance in the number of earthquakes which take place
upon days close to the Syzygies, over those which occur at the Quadra-
tures. However, it is but a general law which can be observed in the state-
ment of figures of which the tables are composed; and there are numerous
exceptions. In order to weaken the force of these anomalies, and more

clearly to exhibit the fundamental law, M. Alexis Perrey divides the 29^.

53 1, of which the lunation is composed, into 12ths, 16ths, 8ths,-vand foi-ms,
by proportionate calculations applied to the ciphers of his different tables

constructed on the solar days, the numbers which correspond to each frac-
tion of lunation ; he displays in all these new tables (excepting some
anomalies of detail) the law of the predominance of earthquakes at the
Syzygies, and thus confirms more and more his conclusion, that, for half a
century, earthquakes have been more frequent at the Syzygies than at the

Quadratures. M. Alexis Perrey has also studied, in the more or less exten-

sive registers which assisted him to draw up his different Tables, the ques-
tion, whether there exists any connexion between the occurrence of earth-
quakes and the variable distance of the moon from the earth in traversing
the different portions of her elliptical orbit. For this purpose he has cal-
culated in each of his registers, and according to the different modes of
computation employed to draw up the above-mentioned tables, how often
earthquakes have occurred two days before and after, and upon the day of
the moon's perigee and apogee ; and he has shown, in the numbers thus ob-
tained, that the total corresponding to the perigee, in which the moon is
nearest the earth, is greater than that corresponding to the fipogee, in which
                  --

ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OP EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 35

she is at her greatest distance : then, in order to compare the results, he has

taken the difference of the totals thus obtained and divided it by their sum,

^' ~>which has given him the quotients ,-^'
                         ^' --' ~g' gp^'                        which are

all greater than ^' and the last almost equal to ^'

    " The apparent result from this is, that the difference between the unequal
attraction exercised by the moon at her greatest and nearest distance has a

sensible influence over the occurrence of earthquakes. In the note on the

' occurrence of Earthquakes in connexion with the passing of the Moon
over the Meridian,' which he presented to the Academy January 2, 1854*,
M. Alexis Perrey discusses the question, whether the division of the shocks

of earthquake during a lunar day is, like the tides, connected with the

passage of the moon over the superior and inferior meridian. For this
method of investigation he could only avail himself of the 824 shocks felt at

Arequipa, which are registered with day and hour in the above-mentioned

table of M. de Castelnau. By means of proportional calculations, which

must have occupied a considerable time, he has calculated to which hour

after the passage of the moon over the meridian, each of these shocks cor-
responds. He thus formed a 1st table (which he afterwards changed by

dividing it into sixteen equal portions, grouped side by side, to form eighths)
containing the 24 hours 50 minutes and a half of which a lunar day gene-

rally consists.

" By these two methods (notwithstanding some marked anomalies which

could not but exist in so limited a number of facts as 824.>), the results

obtained in both arrangements manifest the existence, in the length of a lunar

day, of two periods of maximum for the occurrence of shocks, and two of

minimum. The two periods of maximum occur at the hours of the passing

of the moon over the superior and inferior meridians ; and the periods of
minimum fall about the middle of the intervals.

" M. Alexis Perrey has thus succeeded, by the simple analysis of catalogues

which he had previously drawn up, in proving, by three different and inde-.

pendent methods, the influence which the moon possesses in the production

of earthquakes :

" 1st. That earthquakes occur more frequently at the Syzygies.

"2nd. That their frequency increases at the Perigee, and diminishes at

the Apogee of the moon.

" 3rd. That the shocks of earthquake are more frequent when the moon

is near the meridian than when she is 90 degrees away from it.

" But the numerical tables from which these three propositions are derived,

present some anomalies ; and the author has omitted nothing to endeavour to

account for them, and to prove the law which is revealed at their first in-

spection. He first conceived the idea of constructing graphically the num-

bers contained in the tables, so as to obtain by the usual method a poly-

gonal line analogous to those by which barometrical observations are usually

represented, in which the eye catches at once the general course of pheno-

Wemena in the midst of anomalies which tend to conceal it.      are tempted

to regret that he has not further developed this graphical part of his work,

which would have had the great advantage of displaying at a glance the

direct result of his researches ; and that he has not even annexed to his me-

moir any of the lines which he constructed. But M. Alexis Perrey con-

sidered that he would obtain still more certain results by employing calcu-

lation ; and to this arduous task he devoted the 2nd Chapter of his principal

paper, and the Second Part of his note of the 2nd January, 1834. It M'ould

be difficult for us to follow the author step by step in these analytical discus-

                                                                       d2
             --

sions ; we will restrict ourselves to the observation, that, in order to repre-

sent the result of his work, he has employed a formula of interpolation of

this kind :

"0=M + Asin (<+a) + Bsin (2<+/3) + Csin (St+y)-\  , in which M,

A, B, C, &c. are always coefficients of the same nature as (^ ; a, /3, y, &c.,

are always angles, and t a variable angle dependent on the lunar motion, which

will be equal to degree for the new moon, to 90 degrees for the first

quarter, to 180 degrees for the full moon, &c. He then adapts this for-

mula to the numerical tables deduced from observation, and determines the

particular truths which it contains. By means of tlie formula thus ob-

tained, the author was enabled to draw up numerical tables corresponding

to those deduced from observation alone, and in which the law of the phe-
nomena appears disconnected from the principal anomalies which tended to

obscure it in the first tables. The numbers contained in these new tables

are carefully arranged, and form regular curved lines, in which the law is

--clearly manifest. These curves have a marked resemblance to each other,

although they are not entirely alike which could not be, for they are only
approximative-- and each bears the stamp of the group of figures which it

represents. The resemblance of these curves is essentially increased by the

fact that each presents two principal maxima corresponding to the Syzygies,

Weand two principal minima corresponding to the Quadratures.  are thus
--brought back to the conclusion so evident by M. A. Perrey's toil, that, for

half a century, earthquakes have been more frequent at the Syzygies than at

the Quadratures.

" The Academy fully conceives the importance of this conclusion, and

appreciates the labour the author has taken to collect nearly 7000 observa-

tions on the first half of this century. This number, however, is very small

for the solution of a question of this nature ; and it is very desirable to have :
it increased, either by collecting all future observations from year to year,

or by going back to past centuries, as the author has already commenced

doing."

   These views of Perrey have found support in the opinions enunciated

by M. Zantedeschi as to the probable existence of a terrestrial as well as

an oceanic tide, one in which the solid mass of the earth's crust, and the

liquid or semiliquid nucleus beneath (if indeed it exist in any such state) is
supposed to be an ellipsoid, with a major axis perpetually following the move-

ments of the moon and sun. To what extent such a change of form is possible

in the solid material of our planet under the constraint of the same forces that
produce the oceanic tides (and whose elevations must in so far act against
such change of form), it is for physical astronomy to determine. But even

if its existence be admitted, and the change of level of a given point on the

--earth's surface were proved to amount to many feet to far more, in fact,

than the total elevation of the greatest ocean tide-wave, it is difficult to con-

ceive how it even then could be a direct or immediate cause of earthquakes.
Such change of form would be probably quite insignificant as compared

with the earth's total mass ; so that the flexures or changes of form produced
by it in the solid crust would probably be far within the elastic limits of its
materials, and, hence, the occurrence of fractures or dislocations due to such
a train of causes impossible.

    If it ultimately prove a fact that there is a real relation in epoch between
earthquakes and the ocean tides, or the moon's and sun's position in respect
to the earth, the phenomena will probably be found in relation, only through
the intervention of changes in terrestrial temperature, or in the great circu-

lations upon or within our planet, of its electrical, or magnetic, or thermic

currents, or the conversion of these into each other reciprocally, and not to

the direct action of the variable attractive forces of our primary and our

satellite. To some such conversions of force into heat, developed at local
foci, it would appear much more probable that all volcanic phenomena are

due, than to a universal ocean of incandescent and molten lava beneath our

feet, witli a thin crust of solid matter covering it, the present or historical

existence of which is not only not proven, but for which no argument of

weighty probabiHty has been, as I conceive, advanced.

    In the present state of our knowledge of the obscure relations between
the internal mass and actions of our planet with the cosmical forces that

act upon it both within our own atmosphere and from the abysses of

space beyond, and in our comparative ignorance even of the terrestrial

phenomena themselves, no speculation, however hazardous or hardy, that
is based upon a natural hypothesis, need be regretted : such views in the

beginning of every separate road of inductive science are eminently sug-

gestive, and, although in themselves false, may point towards truth. It is only
in this aspect that a memoir by Dr. C. F. Winslow, M.D., ' On the Causes

of Tides, Earthquakes, Rising of Continents, and Variations of Magnetic
Force,' requires notice. The communication appears to have been made to
the Academy of Sciences of San Francisco, California, by the author, in 1854<
or 1855. I have met with it only through a printed copy, for which I believe

I am indebted to the author.

   That our satellite does actually influence the magnet directly, has been
discovered by Herr Kreil, of the Vienna Royal Observatory (see ' Phil.
Trans.,' 1857, and 'Proc. Roy. Soc.,' vol. vii. pp. 67-75). General Sabine,

--in the introduction to vol. iii. of ' Magnetic and Meteoric Observations made

at Toronto,' p. 9, states " The decennial solar period often or eleven years,

in connexion with the solar spots, proved to connect itself with the magnet-
ism of the earth, but not with other cosmical phenomena" (see ' Phil. Trans.
1852,' Art. VIII.) ; that is to say, I presume, not with such cosmical phe-

--nomena as have had their laws already ascertained. Again (p. xi.), the

author adds " The solar diurnal variation appears to be wholly irrecon-
cilable with the hypothesis which attributes the magnetic variation to

thermic causation."

  We find, then, that both sun and moon influence, with other and more

occult forces than those that address sense and eye, our planet, and that these
all incessantly modify tiie conditions and relations (mutual and to things on
the surface) of every grain of matter in the inmost recesses of its nucleus.
While every cosmical force is thus, as soon as its laws are discovered, found
to be correlated to every other, all mutually convertible, and capable of
disappearing and reappearing " by measure, number, and weight," as mere
brute power or mechanical force, it is not too much, at least, to affirm
the advancing probability, that a distinctly (though irregularly) periodic
phenomenon, such as earthquakes, will be found intimately related to them,
possibly with no very long or intricate intermediate chain of causation.

  _ As regards the periodicity, &c., of those solar spots which admit of con-
sideration in relation to the two paroxysmal maxima and two minima in each
century (noticed hereafter), Humboldt may be referred to (' Cosmos, ' vol.
iii. p. 291). Schwabe of Dessau, whose works the illustrious author quotes,

observed the solar spots from 1826, and, during the whole period, found three

maxima (average number 300,) and two minima (average number 33,) the
period being about ten years, or the tenth part of a century. Wolf of Berne
(' Comptes Rendus,' vol. xxx.) considers the period of the minima as de-

finite, but that the maximum varies, being on an average five j'ears after the

minimum, and  that  nine   minimum  periods  exactly make up each  century
                                                                                                      ;

adding, that all the notable apparitions of solar spots on record agree with

this rule. Other papers on this subject will be found, with details in the

'Ast. Nach.' and ' Pogg. Ann.,' from 1850; and in ' Silliman's Journal,'

vol. XXV., some remarks of Reichenbach are worthy of attention. He ob-

serves that the period of Jupiter is 11-86 years, and that there are certain

--coincidences between the planet's periodic returns and those of the solar

spots, adding that their conjoint magnetic effects upon our planet, in rela-
tion to the magnetic periods above referred to, cannot but be great. See also
' Gilbert's Annalen,' vols. xv. and xxi., for Ritter's memoirs on the subject

and " Hansteen on the Relations between Earthquakes and the Aurora," in

' Bull, de I'Acad. de Bruxelles,' 1854, t. xxi.

  I am myself indebted to my friend Dr. Robinson, Astronomer Royal,
Armagh, for much of my information upon the subject, which connects

itself with our own in relation to the preceding reflections, and through the

--singular point of coincidence as to periodic recurrences in both the one

presenting traces of being in time a submultiple of the other. But at present

this must all be taken for what it is worth, and no more.
   It may be suitable to remark here, that the movements of the inclination

magnetometer as well as of the barometric column, of which several have

been of late years recorded as occurring at the time of earthquakes, are

most probably merely mechanical and due to the shock movements direct.

This has been ascertained by Kreil at Vienna, and Padre Secchi at Rome

(see also Perrey's 'Mem. Europe and Africa,' p. 11); and such appears to
have been Humboldt's view (though expressed with some qualification)

at the date of publication of ' Cosmos.'

   The following is a translation of Zantedeschi's expressions of his own views

as to the occurrence of a terrestrial, or rather terrene tide, probably better

named, if it exist, the elastic tide :

   " On the Influence of the Moon upon Earthquakes, and on the Conse-

quences probably derivable as to the Ellipsoidal Figure of the Earth and

the Oscillation of the Pendulum. By M. F. Zantedeschi." Comptes Rendusy

Seance du 2 Aout, 1854.

" I have thought for a long time that the form of the earth cannot always

be the same, but that it presents an incessantly changing elliptical form,

that is to say, having a continued tendency to become protuberant in the

directions of the radii vectores of the two luminaries which attract it, the

sun and the moon. I have always believed that a direct proof of it might be

obtained by determining a point in the heavens at the epochs of the spring

tides, and at that of the Quadratures. This point must appear lower at the

epochs of the high tides and of the Syzygies. The Imperial Observatory of

Paris, with the means that it has at its disposal, could prove if this difference
be observable, and especially now, that, thanks to the labours of M. Froment,

dividing has been made so exact as to admit of measuring with the greatest

precision a difference of fi-J-iyth of a millimetre between two consecutive

visible horizontal lines.

" I have always assumed that a compensation pendulum of such a length

that it exactly beats seconds at the epoch of the quadratures and of the neap

tides, must beat more slowly at the epoch of the spring tides, from the

transit of the moon over the meridian of the given place, and at the epoch

of the syzygies ; and, taking from this fact that the variations of the force
of attraction upon the mass of the earth are continuous, I have concluded

from it the necessity for astronomy to take account of these times; and

   ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 39

herein I find the explanation of certain leaps of astronomical clocks of which
 the learned have not hitherto been able to discern the cause. I believe
that one day we shall have the equation of time in functions of the varia-
tions of intensity of the planetary attractions, and of the regular oscillatory

movements of the earth, as we now have the equation of time in functions

of the motions of translation and of rotation of the earth itself. I say the

regular oscillatory motions, because, as for the irregular movements, we
cannot submit them to rule, and we are enabled to account only for the
extraordinary concomitant phenomena presented by the atmosphere, by the
earth, and by certain species of animals. The irregular motions which we

call earthquakes, happen more frequently, it has been observed, either at
the epoch of the Syzygiss rather than at the epoch of the Quadratures, or
oftener at the epoch of spring tides than at that of the neaps. This important
observation is found in the works of Georges Baglivi and Joseph Toaldo.

    The first, in his ' Storia Roman! Terras Motus, anni 1703,' says, "In

singulis lunae aspectibus, seu quadraturis, potissimura in plenitudine ejusdem

seu totali oppositione cum sole, certo succedebant terras motus, frequenter

--paululum prajcedebant ipsos aspectus." Georgii Baglivi Opera Omnia,

Bassani, 1737, p. 415, Editionis Venetiarum, 1752, p. 326.

   Toaldo, speaking generally of earthquakes, says, " the late M. Bouguer
in the account of his voyage to Peru speaks much of earthquakes, so fre-
quent in that country. He mentions with doubt the assertion of a Peru-
vian ' savant,' that earthquakes have certain fatal and marked lines when
they occur at low water. On the other hand, Chauvalon, in his voyage to

Martinique, notes particularly the earthquakes which took place at the

time of high water ; and the earthquake which destroyed Lima on tlie 28th

of October, 1746, occurred at three o'clock in the morning, at the instant of

high water (ora della prima acqua). Thus we remark in other countries
that these phenomena may themselves depend on the cosmical causes of the
action of the sun, and especially of the moon." (Giuseppe Toaldo, ' Della

Vera Influenza degli Astri, etc., Saggio Meteorologico,' Padova, 1770,

p. 190.) I hope that the Academy of Sciences will well receive these do-
cuments and tiiese ideas, which tend to augment the merit and the value
of the very important studies of M. Perrey.

   Edmonds, also, has endeavoured to show that many formidable earth-
quakes are found to have occurred the day after the moon is in her first

quarter (' Journ. Polytec. Soc. Cornwall,' Note 158 ; Sabine's ' Cosmos').

   Before dismissing the subject of other earthquake catalogues, the follow-
ing labour as to Indian earthquakes should be noticed. In the 'Journal of
the Royal Asiatic Society,' vol. xii. n. s., for 1843, Lieut. R. Baird Smith,

B.E., made one of the most extensive contributions to our slender stock of

oriental earthquake annals. He divides India into nine earthquake tracts,

partly on physical grounds, partly arbitrarily, viz.

                                 1. Central Himalaya;
                                  2. Lateral Himalaya, including

                                                  a. Cabul,
                                                        b. Jellallabad,
                                              c. Cashmere,

                              3. The Solyraaun Mountains,

             6. The Vindhya Mountains,

             7. Delta of the Ganges,

             9. Eastern Ghauts;

and under these divisions describes more or less fully a total number of
162 earthquakes, which he finally tabulates, by date and place only. The

epoch of his catalogue commences nominally at a.d. 1505; but almost the

whole of the catalogue refers to the 19th century, and comes down to the

year 184.2.

   After his remarks upon the earthquakes of the first region (p, 1039), he
observes, " The hot springs, I believe, owe their high temperature to in-

ternal chemical action  extensively distributed                                                                                                and  the earthquakes are  due
                                                                                                                                            ;

to the convulsive efforts of the elastic matter generated by this action in

escaping from the interior of the earth." ..." To define the nature of this

action, while ignorant of the chemical nature of the springs, would be in
vain;" .... but .... "I cannot resist the conviction that both are due to
one and the same origin." . . . . " There are no active volcanic vents yet dis-

covered in the Himalayas, but abundant hot springs and trap dykes, and

evidences of disruptive action."

   In the same vol. p. 741, a translation, by A. Sprenger, of the Arabic

MS. in the Imperial Library at Paris, of a work of As. Soyuti on earth-
quakes, is given. The original work is entitled, ' Kashf as salsalah'an
wass az Zalzalah,' i.e. "a clearing up of the history of earthquakes." It

contains a catalogue of about 120 earthquakes in Western India, Persia,

and Caubul, and extending to Arabia, Syria, and Egypt. It certainly, how-

ever, scarcely warrants its title, and contains few facts of scientific value.

--Again (p. 907), a small catalogue of earthquakes in Upper Assam occurs
   the authors, Capt. Hannay and Rev. N. Brown. The chief statement

of importance to be found in it is their opinion, that in this region the hori-

zontal direction of shock seems to be mainly from S.W. to N.E.

Since the publication of former ' Reports,' some monographs of single

earthquakes have appeared ; but reference is here only to catalogues.

While these sheets have been passing through the press, the work of Dr.

Otto Wolger, with catalogues of the Swiss earthquakes, has appeared, and

--demands notice for the extreme accuracy and care with which the volumes

liave been produced, ' Untersuchungen iiber das Phanoraen der Erdbeben

in der Schwitz,' von Dr. G. H. Otto Wolger, Gotha 1857, 1858, 3 vols. Svo.
The first, " Chronic der Erdbeben in der Schwitz," also embraces a discussion

as to the periodicity, locality, and extent (Ausdehnung) of the Swiss earth-

quakes, with the results graphically reproduced.

   The second contains the geology of the Canton of Wallis, in which so
great a number of rapidly recurrent feeble shocks have been so long recorded.

   The third, ' Geschichte der Erdbeben (im Wallis) des meteorologischen

Jahres 1855,' together with a chronicle of those in the Swiss Cantons and

adjacent parts of France.

   There is an excellent though small map of the Canton of Wallis, showing
the points of observation of the many small shocks that have become identi-

--fied with the name of Pignerol as a centre and in several instances showing

--the horizontal directions observed which quite bear out the observations to

be found further on, as to the effects of surface in perturbing the general
emergent direction of the wave of shock.

The work of Dr. Wolger is entitled to the study of physical geologists.

   ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 41

Perhaps, like most men who carefully and lovingly perfect their subject, he

attaches a too preponderant value to the limited district of which he treats.

   Having so far considered the labours of others as to the distribution of
earthquakes in time, some remarks remain to be made on their distribution
in space by foreign authors. The seismic map of Berghaus in his ' Physical
Atlas,' is the most important attempt of this sort emanating from abroad.

The following are Perrey's remarks upon this map (' Mem. de I'Academie

des Sciences de Dijon,' t. iv. annee 1855, p. 57) :

   " M. Berghaus, of Berlin, has devoted map No. 7 of the geological part

of his beautiful Physical Atlas to volcanic and seismic manifestations.
Greenland is very slightly coloured, and is included in the circumference
of a circle of percussions, the centre of which is in Iceland. This state-

ment does not appear to me to be at all supported by facts. The author

appears to have outstripped observation ; for the commotions in Iceland
 constitute an almost local phenomenon ; rarely ever is the island simul-
 taneously shaken in its entire extent, and the shocks are only of moderate

 intensity."

    It may be added, that observation points out that the connexion as to

 earthquake commotion is between Iceland and Norway, and not between

 Iceland and Greenland. Of the latter country, however, in this respect we
 know but little.

    As to Greenland, I do not know whether any earthquake has occurred
 there but that of November, 1755. That was violently felt; it caused a
 terror so much the greater, as shocks of this nature were completely un-
 known. However, it is probable that they are occasionally felt.

     The 22nd of September, 1757, there was a violent hurricane, the wind
 from the south, accompanied by hail and rain : the lightning was terrific,
 but without thunder. It was generally believed that a shock of earthquake

 &was felt. (Prevost, ' Hist. Gen. des Voy.' t. ix. pp. 23 209.) Earthquakes,

  the author adds, are rare in this country.

    Two years after, in September, 1759, at New Herrnhut (Greenland), the

 house of Siehlenfels experienced shocks like an earthquake, although it was
 very low and had walls four feet thick. The houses around suffered severely :
 the roofs were spilt ; and the boats drawn up on shore were carried away
 by the hurricane, which was felt at a distance. This storm was preceded

 and followed by igneous meteors, one of which set fire to the house. On

 Christmas Eve a similar phenomenon occurred at noon. (Prevost, /. c.

  t. xix. p. 208.)
     These are the only facts that I can quote relative to this country,

 mywhich, I repeat, notwithstanding its contiguity to Iceland, ought not, in

 opinion, to be placed within the sphere of the volcanic and seismic action of

  that island.

     M. Berghaus has marked the Azores and Canaries with a darker shade
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

 and this memoir will contribute to confirm the author's idea of also co-
  louring the Archipelago of Cape Verd and the Antilles. But it leaves all
  the rest of the basin uncoloured; and surely it is difficult not to admit
 some shading, however slight, in latitudes distinguished of late by M.
  Daussy. Let us again repeat, that earthquakes, which ought to form an im-
  portant part in the study of terrestrial physics and physical geography, have
  hitherto been too much neglected. They have been resigned to geology,

 to which, in my opinion, they only indirectly belong.

     But to continue. Algeria bears, on M. Berghaus's map, a very dark shade,
  which the note I published in our last ' Memoirs' does not justify. Yet the
                                                                                                                   !

--42 REPORT 1858.

illustrious physicist whom I have just quoted includes the Azores and

Canaries in the seismic region of the Mediterranean.

They would seem to form the western part of an axis which extends to

Hindostan with variable shades, and thus unites the Atlantic with the great

volcanic chain of the Sonde (Sunda), which, as we know, is connected by

the Japanese and Kurile Islands with the Aleutian Archipelago, and by this

chain to the grand volcanic range of the two Americas. This idea is in-

genious, but is it true ? It is a point that I cannot at present discuss. Yet

we must admit that the Azores, and even the Canaries, seem to form a part

of the sphere of subterranean convulsions, the centre of which is almost

parallel to Lisbon ; and to be at the western extremity of that great seismic

zone which proceeds by the peninsulas of Spain, Italy, and Greece, to the

volcanoes of Asia Minor, and which tiiere joins the central chain of Asia.

It is, in fact, within this zone, extending towards the north as far as the Car-

pathian Mountains, that the principal centres of earthquakes and the most

remarkable seismic axes in Europe are to be found. Extending to the

west along the 40th parallel, this zone reaches the United States of Ame-
rica, where it embraces New York and Boston, v/hich M. Berghaus has per-

haps marked with a rather too dark colour, though earthquakes are not rare

there ; and thence it proceeds to Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri, where

the phenomena of the year ISll demand a darker shade in M. Berghaus's
beautiful map. M. Berghaus draws a linear region in Arabia, from Medina

to Yemen, along tlie east coast of the Red Sea. Can this be a partial

--axis of convulsion? Is it independent of the Mediterranean zone? Or is

it united to it by a second axis the Syrian axis, parallel to the east coast

of the Mediterranean? But the countries near to the Isthmus of Suez ap-

pear little subject to earthquakes ; can there be a solution of continuity

between these two axes ? or does the space which divides them, and where the

phenomenon has, so far, been so rarely remarked, constantly present a pecu-

liarity verified more than once in America? In the New World (at Ca-

raccas, for example) certain regions of small extent have been observed to

enjoy a complete calm while the neighbouring country experienced fright-

ful catastrophes.

The historians of these disasters have characterized this unconvulsed part

of the soil by a picturesque expression, namely, " a bridge has been formed."

The probable phj'sical explanation of this phenomenon of "the bridge" has

been given in a former Report (2nd Report, p. 309), by the author of this,

based upon the view that total reflection of elastic impulses may occur under

certain suitable conditions.

Perrey continues, "No simultaneous convulsions at both extremities of

this Syro-Arabic linear region have been recorded. However, if we recall

that the Himalaya Mountains are very subject to subterranean convulsions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

that the Alps, and especially the Pyrenees, are frequently shaken, the Cau-

casus-range still oftener, and that the Andes are almost always in a state of

commotion                                                   must we  not regret  that we  possess  no information  concerning
                                                         ;

the phenomena in the high Ethiopian chain ? is it not to be desired that

travellers in Africa should make observations upon a matter so interesting

to science?

   " During the last few years Abyssinia (strongly marked in M. Berghaus's
map) has been the study of numerous French explorers. Several narratives

of their vast and useful labours have appeared ; but I do not find one word
about earthquakes ! The Academy of Sciences has just given new instruc-
tions to M. Rochet (d'Hericourt), about to undertake a third expedition to

that country ; and the phenomenon is not even mentioned by M. Duperrey
                                                       --

ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 43

Quite recently, again, I felt the same painful surprise at reading the instruc-

tions given to M. Raffenel.

" Does Abyssinia form an axis of convulsion perpendicular to the Arabic

axis? or is it the eastern extremity of an unique axis formed by the great

Ethiopic chain, and crossing the African continent at its greatest breadth ?

" In nearly the same latitude as Abyssinia, but on the western coast of

Africa, we find the sources of the Senegal and Gambia vividly coloured in

M. Berghaus's map. What evidence has the author for this statement?

With respect to this region, I am only acquainted with the two following

Wedescriptions drawn from M. Walcknaer's collection."  read, at t. vi.

p. 181, " The aspect of the mountains Nikolo and Bandeia prove that this

country has been the theatre of volcanic eruptions. Earthqualies are very

frequent; and shortly before M. Mollieu's visit, one of the most violent had

occurred, the shocks of which had been felt as far as Timbo." And further

on, p. IS't, " The mountains, covered with ferruginous stones and cinders,

which enclose the valley in which are the sources of the Senegal and Gambia,

lead M. Mollieu to believe that they occupy the crater of an extinct volcano.

This traveller was at the source of the Gambia, April 8, 1818."

  --It is useful to compare this passage with the following, extracted from

tlie same collection, t. xii. p. 356 : "There is no record in Senegal that

any portion of the colony has ever experienced an earthquake."

Without seeking to justify the accuracy of M. Berghaus, it may not

be uninteresting to remark that the Antilles and the Republic of Guate-

mala lie under the same parallel of latitude (about 13° N.) as Abyssinia and

the sources of the Gambia.

Can there be an axis, or rather an immense zone, of convulsions parallel

to the Equator? Often convulsed in the western counterforts (the Archi-

pelagos of Cape Verd and the Canaries), Africa suffers also in the S.E.,

in the great southern chain of Madagascar. I find in M. Seguerel de la
Combe that " earthquakes are very frequent in Madagascar. When they

occur, the natives leave their houses and commence beating the walls with

their hands. They do not allege any reason for this conduct but custom."

(' Voy. u Madagascar et aux lies Comorres,' t. i. p. .3.)

   Let me add this remark from an ancient traveller in Madagascar : " Hap-

pily earthquakes are here completely unknown." (Le Gentil, ' Voy. dans

les Mers de ITnde,' t. ii. p. 367.)

If we subjoin to these contradictory statements the few facts which we

   " 1786, August 4, 6-5r) a.m., in the Isle of France, two violent but harm-
less shocks. The motion was horizontal and vertical. The barometer was

not affected. Earthquakes are of rare occurrence. The volcano in Bour-

   '809, Sth of January, the island of Penguin, close to the Cape of Good
l-n-ipe, was swallowed up by an earthquake. I am unacquainted with this
island, and I only find this circumstance related in an anonymous work

entitled ' Memorial de Chronologic,' t. ii. p. 932.

   Here, again, relative to another earthquake of the same year, 1809, are
the details communicated by M. Barchers, Minister of Stellenbosch (country

of the Hottentots), to Campbell (end of November 1812), concerning the

fij-st of the earthquakes which occurred three years previously :

there once a month. On Saturday, the eve of the day on which I had to go

there, I felt extremely ill and dejected. On Sunday morning my wife and I

set out. When I reached Paarl, I was very weak, and asked for some water;

but it was lukewarm, and I could not drink it. I was told it had been

brought from the fountain. I sent my slave, but what he brought Mas hot.
WeI went thither myself, and found it was really the case.
                                                                  could not

knew what 1 was saying.

" After the sermon, I spoke of this sensation to several of my friends, who

following morning. The whole of that day my family and servants and

myself felt very unwell; the dogs also shared in our uneasiness.

" At 10 o'clock we were all alarmed by a noise like that caused by nume-
Werous carts rolling through streets.

that a thunder-bolt had burst, 1 exhorted them not to be alarmed, as the

Ato use a Scriptural expression, that ' there was no more life in us.'     third

shock followed ; it was less violent than the first two. The noise was dreadful,

not only owing to its loudness, but also to its nature. 1 can only describe

it as a sort of groaning, or piteous howling. The dogs and birds testified
their fear by their cries. The night was calm, not a breath of wind stirred

the air ; but I remarked a number of luminous meteors. I observed small

clouds in various quarters, but their aspect presented nothing new. Every

one endeavoured to keep close to me ; alarm was excessive ; I said what I

could to allay it. At last we ventured to return to the house, and endeavoured

to sleep to recover ourselves ; but the effort was vain." (Walckenaer, ' Collect,

des Relat. de Voy. en Afrique,' t. xviii. p. 275.)

1810, in the depth of winter an earthquake occurred at the Cape of

Good Hope.

1811, 2nd June, five minutes before 12 o'clock noon, another earthquake

took place. The heat was greater than usual at this season, the thermometer

Awas 16°'8 R. thick mist filled the atmosphere, yet did not obscure the sun's

rays ; not the least breeze disturbed the air. The inhabitants, who greatly

dread subterraneous shocks, were reminded by these symptoms of the earth-

quake of the preceding year. M. Burchell was busy indoors with prepara-

tions for a missionary journey, when suddenly a noise like an explosion

shook the entire house. Three or four seconds afterwards a second peal

like thunder produced another shock ; at the same instant a singular motion

and vacillation in the atmosphere was apparent, whilst the sky continued

perfectly serene. M. Burchell ran out to discover what had occurred ; he

saw all the inhabitants running out of their houses in great alarm, pale and

trembling, not conscious what they were doing, the women either screaming

with terror, or motionless and incapable of speech. After the second shock,

the trembling of the atmosphere had ceased, and the temperature a little

cooled. The people gradually regained their composure, observing that no
more shocks followed. Many houses were injured, and walls split.

This earthquake took place five minutes before noon, during the Cape

winter ; the preceding year it occurred during the night, in the height of

summer : so this phenomenon is not limited to any time of day or year.

M. Burchell saw the trace of electricity in all the preceding symptoms,

and can only explain the earthquake as an explosion of electric matter.

On the morning of the 19th another shock was felt, but unaccompanied

Aby explosion or other consequences.  slight sound was heard, which

appeared to travel from N. to S., and lasted about three seconds. (Walcke-

naer, loc. cit. t. xx. p. 20-22.)

   To these facts we may subjoin the following :

1811, 7th June, at the Cape of Good Hope a violent shock of five

minutes ; the houses tottered, and even the vessels in the bay felt the shock.

(J. D. 14.th Nov. ; M. U. 15th Nov. 1811.)
    1818, on the night between the 28th Feb. and 1st March, in the Isle of

France, a hurricane similar to that of 1716 ; it is alleged that shocks of
earthquake were felt. (J. D. 21st June 1818.)

   1821, 9th March, in the Island of Bourbon a slight shock. The erup-
tion of the volcano, which had commenced on the 28th February, still

continued. (C. P. t. xxxiii. p. 404! ; Garnier, Meteor, p. 124.)
    1840, 7th July, in the Isle of Bourbon, earthquakes recorded without

detail by M. Meister in the Annalen fiir Meteor- und Erdmag., ler cahier,

p. 161.

   1844, 21st Feb., 8 p.m., in Isle of Bourbon, shocks and terrible wind
(communic. de M. Meister.)

   If we add to these five or six earthquakes the eruptions of the volcano in
the Island of Bourbon in 1708, -51, -66, -74, -86, -87, -91, -93, and 1800, we
shall have all the manifestations which I can quote of the interior activity of

the globe in the south of the African continent. So this part of Africa appears

little subject to subterranean commotions. But is it the same with the

interior of the country ? It would be very interesting to learn this.

  Johnston, in his Seismic Map (Phys. Atlas, No. 7, Geol.), lightly tints

the southern extremity of Africa, left untouched by Berghaus.

   To these remarks of Perrey may be added, tiiat both Berghaus's and
Johnston's seismic maps alike labour under two most important defects.

    First, a hard and rigid line, often of an extremely irregular figure, limits
strictly and definitely the supposed boundary of seismic commotion in each

assigned region. Two physical misconceptions are involved in this : first,

that forces emanating from a centre, of the nature of earthquake shocks, can
have any definite boundary; secondly, that a line drawn upon the earth's
surface around any centre of impulse, and through a number of points at
which the horizontal elements of shock are alike (suppose those at which
these elements become insensible without the help of instruments, which

would be the boundary line in a popular sense), can possibly have, when

embracing large areas, a highly irregular though closed curvilinear figure.

The curve traced through such a line of points must circumscribe a space

either nearly circular or slightly elliptic ; all irregularities due to variation
of surface vanish over such vast spaces.

    Irregular curved areas are alone possible on the assumption of more than

one impulse propagated from the same origin simultaneously, of which we

have as yet no evidence.

   The second defect common to both those maps, and possibly difficult to

be avoided from their small scale, is the absence of any positive and in-
variable, though conventional principle of application of the depth of tint in
colouring, which shall determine, by its depth, the intensity and frequency
of seismic action at given centres.

   The principles adopted with the seismic map attached to this report will

be explained further on.

   Berghaus's maps (3 Abtheil. Geol. No. 7 und No. 9) give an exceed-
ingly imperfect notion of the whole east of China, and indeed of the Sunda
                --

 --46 REPORT 1858.

  and Philippine Island groups, including Luzon, incomparably the most im-
  portant and int,eresting earthqualce region on the face of the earth. Berg-

 haus's maps, 3 Abtheil. Geol. No. 8 und 10, " Specialia vom Vuikan Giirtel,"

  &c., are worthy of all commendation, save as respects the outline of seismic
  regions already adverted to, and here repeated even in a more distorted
  form.

     Such have been the results of previous labours as to the distribution in

 time and space of earthquakes. I proceed to those deduced from our own

  researches.

     At the conclusion of the Second Report (1851), the principles upon
 which the British Association Earthquake Catalogue itself was compiled have
 been described ; it remains now to describe the methods by which it has
 been discussed, and to state the results.

     The collection of an earthquake catalogue is a work essentially of a sta-
 tistic character, and partakes of all that disadvantage and incompleteness
 that belongs to the collection of facts not the result of choice and experi-
 ment, but presented to us, through various and imperfect observations, from
 many places and through long-lapsed periods, during which all the conditions
 of observation have suffered much change, so that the facts that are presented
 for record, and those of which no account is given, are alike subject to

 certain contingent or accidental modifying conditions, but of such a nature
 as to defy our making them part of our discussion.

    So in a work which proposes to collect under one view the transmitted
observations of the whole human race, and of all historic time on this
particular subject, the conditions of human observation itself enter into
the results, and our earthquake record is at once an account of these phaeno-
mena, and of the rise, progress, and extension of human knowledge and
observational energy, and also of the multiplication and migrations of the
human family and its progress in maritime power ; in a word, at every mo-
ment the indeterminate extent to which man has fulfilled his great destiny
of " replenishing the earth and subduing it," affects every continuous record

of his observations or his arts.

    The method of discussion followed was that of numerical analysis as to
time, and topical analysis as to space, from which curves graphically repre-

senting the results have been projected by the usual methods.

   One conventional arrangement has been found inevitable. It refers to

the cases of long-continued slight shocks or tremors, occurring almost daily,
as at Pignerol in 1808; St. Jean de Maurienne in 1839 ; Comrie, in Perth-

shire, 1839-184'7; and Ragusa in 1843-1850. In these the slight shocks
recorded for each month of the disturbed period are grouped as forming one

earthquake at the locality. Had not some such arbitrary rule been adopted,

these comparatively insignificant, though frequently repeated exhibitions
of seismic force (if they be such) would, when introduced in the curves,
have given, at certain points of time, a false elevation to the abscisste, while
the phenomena themselves are not of a character materially to modify our
results even if excluded.

   The conclusions possible from the still vast mass of facts here brought to-

gether, however, will, as a first generalization, be found, I apprehend, not
unimportant.

   They may be classed under two great heads ; viz. the relation of seismic

energy to time and to space, or the distribution of recorded earthquakes
in each. And, first,
   ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 4lJ

                         Of Seismic Energy in relation to Time.

   Plates 1. 11. III. IV. V. and VI. carry down the stream of time the whole
series of observations from 2000 years before the Christian era to the year

1850.

   In all these chrono-seismic curves the ordinate is that of epoch, and must
not be confounded with one expressing in anywise the duration of each
shock or separate seismic effort. The abscissa is that of seismic intensity,
which has been assumed proportional to the number of coincident seismic
efforts, without taking any account in the curve of the variable intensity of
different efforts. This is a source of uncertainty that would not have been
avoided, but rather the tendency to error increased, by any conventional
law of enlargement of the abscissa that could have been devised to suit the
vague proportion of greater or less in earthquake narrations ; but the means
are given to the reader of applying such corrective as the information admits,

Gby placing along the line of time down to the year 1750 the letter above

each epoch at which an earthquake of undoubtedly great and destructive
intensity has been recorded, and the letter S above all those that were so
circumstanced as to have been followed by the influx of " great sea waves."
This notation might have been carried on further, but that after the year
1750, when observations rapidly multiply, the number of earthquakes re-
corded as being " gi'eat " are so numerous, that to distinguish their epochs
thus would have involved the extension of the ordinate to a new and incon-
veniently enlarged scale. For the first three centuries of historic time
(according to our commonly accepted chronology) it will be seen that there
are no earthquake records, and that, while between a.c. 1700 and a.c,
1400 there are a few scattered facts, there is again from a.c. 1400 to a.c.
900, neai'ly a period of five hundred years of perfect blank, followed again
(with a few exceptions) by another blank from a.c, 800 to a.c. 600, Even
in the succeeding century, but two earthquakes are recorded; so that, in

fact, the record of any value for scientific analj'sis may be said to commence

at the five hundredth year before the Christian era.

    It is only in the first century prior to our era that the curve shows that

observations may be at length deemed even continuous, every previous cen-

tury being interrupted by lengthened lacunae.

   From the commencement of the Christian era downwards to the present
day, the abscissae continually increase in closeness and magnitude, and at the

first casual glance suggest the idea that earthquake energy has increased

Weover the whole earth during the course of ages in a fearful manner.

shall see, however, reason to correct any such conclusion.
    Although periods of thirty and forty years occur in the second and third

centuries of our era without the record of a single earthquake, it did not
seem advisable to affirm as certain the want of all observation, by the sub-
stitution here of lacunae for the continuity of the curve.

   The end of the third century first gives evidence of numerical increase;
and the increase thence is steadily progressive up to the year 1850.

   It is not, however, until the seventeenth century that the increased number
of earthquakes becomes strikingly remarkable, increasing still more in the
eighteenth, and presenting a far greater number in the first half of the

nineteenth than in both the preceding centuries taken together.
    Yet this vast and rapid expansion, in the three last centuries especially,

affords no proof whatever that there has been a corresponding, or even any
increase in the frequency of earthquake phenomena. Our chrono-seismic
curve is, in fact, not only a record of earthquakes, but a record of the ad-
--48 REPORT 1858.

vance of human enterprise, travel, and observation. The epochs of printing

and the Reformation are those of the first great expansion, while the dis-

covery of the new world, the voyage to India round the Cape, and the vast

accessions of European colonization and commerce of the last 150 years,
Weconnect themselves as causes with the two latest curves.

Howat once the history of a physical law and that of human progress.  far,

then, is it possible to disentangle these elements, so as to arrive at a con-

clusion as to whether seismic energy over the world is progressive, constant,

or retrooressive ? To do so perfectly is perhaps impossible ; the elements

by which the rate of observational knowledge has been determined are too
complex and too imperfectly known to render any attempt to fix its rate of
expansion in time probable. Even the area of observation itself, the land

and water known to history at given epochs, can  be  but  vaguely sketched
                                                                                                                                       ;

as vaguely also the number of observers, and the determination of the human

--mind towards observation. (See Appendix I.)
   This much is certain, however ; that up to, and even beyond the Christian

era, no record of earthquakes exists for any portions of the earth's surface,
except for limited areas of Europe and Asia, and a still more restricted

patch of Northern Africa, and, if Kaempfer. is to be credited, for Japan, of

which, however, we know nothing for certain. Yet, of the enormously
larger areas of the then outer and unknown world since discovered, it is not

to be supposed but that there was a proportionate (perhaps even for the

"New World" a more than proportionate) amount of earthquake energy,

though not recorded or even known to mankind.

If, however, the curve of total energy (Plate VII.), in which the facts of

all the preceding are condensed into a single line, be examined and com-
pared by a broad glance with the great outlines of human progress, the con-

clusion appears sufficiently warranted, that during all historic time the amount

of seismic energy over the observed portions of our world must have been

nearly constant. To assume that earthquake disturbance has been con-

tinually on the increase, would be to contradict all the analogies of the

physics of our globe. These analogies might lead us to suppose that, like

other violent presumed periodical actions, they were getting spent, and that

the series of earthquake shocks would be found a converging one. Were

this so, however, to any considerable extent, we should not find the vast

expansions of results which the last 300 years present ; or, although the ex-

pansion might be absolutely large, its divergence would not present such

decisive features of progressive increase. The results due to the number of

observers would be more or less balanced by the increasing paucity of events

to observe and record ; but this appears conclusively to lead to the deduc-

tion we have made, namely, that if the curve of total energy be closely

examined century by century, it will be found that, at periods of social torpor

and stagnation of observational energy (and this is so even far down the

stream of time), the number of earthquakes remains nearly constant, or with

a very slight but nearly uniform increase. Thus, from the eleventh to the

beginning of the fifteenth century, the abscissae are almost equal, the crests of

the curves being nearly all ascribable to single great earthquakes, which made

themselves felt over vast areas. Their expansion just keeps pace, so far as can

be judged, with that of contemporaneous human progress ; but if the series

was really a distinctly converging one, at such periods we should find the

abscissae decreasing also. On the other hand, we find the increase in the

number of recorded earthquakes always coinciding with the epochs of in-

creased impulse and energy in the march of the human mind.

  We therefore conclude that our evidence, such as it is, indicates a general
       ----

ON THE PACTS AND THEORY OP EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 49

uniformity in the occurrence of earthquakes as distributed over long epochs
of time. Setting aside (as contradicted by all other sources of analogy and

information) the supposition that this, or any other phenomenon of occa-

--sional disturbance, has an increasing development upon our planet, we have

two remaining alternatives; either that seismic energy is getting gradually

--spent and is dying out this, the evidence before us appears sufficiently to

contradict; or that, upon the whole, during our short and most imperfect
acquaintance witli it, it has remained pretty uniform throughout historic
time, taking one long period with another. Yet, could we extend our view
beyond the short limit of man's history to the vast past duration of that of
our globe itself, it might be found that seismic energy is really a slowly

decreasing force.

  A conclusion thus appearing at the first glance even contradictory to the

presented results from which it is drawn, may bear a certain boldness of

aspect, for which I hope to find that the observations pi'eceding, as to the
true character of all earthquake records, and of the sort and amount of stress

that may be laid upon them, will be held a justification.
   But while such uniformity or insensibly slow decadence may be the fact

through time taken as a whole, there is also evidence of irregular and par-
oxysmal energy in reference to shorter periods ; that is to say, not only (as
all know) do earthquakes occur at some times, and not at others, in any
given spot ; but, taking the whole area of observation together (in which
tiiere is no moment, perhaps, or but a very brief one, wherein thei-e is not an
earthquake somewhere, or more than one), it will be found that there are
epochs when they occur in greater numbers or intensity, either in the same
or in several places within a limited time, i.e. periods of paroxysmal

energy.

    If we omit from our view all the curves of earlier periods and less ample
observation, and limit our consideration to those of the last three centuries and
a half, i.e. from a.d. 1500 to 1850, this paroxysmal chai'acter becomes

evident at a glance, and increasingly so in the last century and a half (the

epoch of all human history the most replete with discovery), wherein the
number of recorded observations is so great, that it was necessary for clear-

ness to double the scale, of the ordinate of the diagram (Plate VI.) in rela-

tion to the preceding ones. On examining these curves, they seem to

justify the following deductions:

1. While the smallest or minimum paroxysmal interval may be a year

       or two, the average interval is from five to ten years of comparative

         repose.

--2. The shorter intervals are in connexion with periods of fewer earthquakes
           not always with those of least intensity, but usually so.

3. The alternations of paroxysm and of repose appear to follow mo
       absolute law deducible from these curves.

4. Two marked periods of extreme paroxysm are observable in each

   -- --century one greater than the other that of greatest number and

        intensity occurring about the middle of each century, the other
        towards the end of each.

This is one of the most remarkable facts that these curves seem to point

to: from about the fiftieth to the sixtieth year of each century, both the

number and intensity of earthquakes will be observed suddenly to shoot up ;
again, during the last quarter of the three complete centuries another but

less powerful paroxysm is apparent. The paroxysmal power at these two

epochs in each century far exceeds any other paroxysms within their limits.

1858.        E
--50 REPORT 1858.

Within the first period (in the 18th century) we find the great Lisbon

earthquake ; within the second, in the same century, the great Calabrian

Weone.  find (referring to the Catalogue itself) earthquakes in great num-
--bers, and many great ones in the Mediterranean basin in the middle of

the 17th century, and the great Jamaica earthquake in its latter decade;

and in the 16th century, its middle period was marked by great earth-

quakes in China and in Europe, and the latter period by numerous shocks,

and most of them severe, as at the Azores, &c. Whether the latter half of

our century shall show the like, remains to be seen ; from its commencement,

however, it presents no paroxysmal period comparable to that between

1840 and 1850.

While this general resemblance of the curves of these latter centuries

admits of no doubt, I would forbear from founding anything thereupon be-

--yond this ; that within this time there seems to elapse a period of about a

century between each of the very greatest paroxysms (number and intensity

together) of earthquakes, and a like period between two other consecutive

paroxysms, of which the second is the next greatest observable, although

far below the first in power ; that a period of thirty to forty years seems

to occur between the first and very greatest paroxysm, and that next in

power below it; and that in the middle period (especially in the I7th and

18th centuries) the number of earthquakes is greatest that crowd into a

very brief time (four or five years), while at the latter period the number

is thickly spread over ten or twelve years.

Upon the whole, the forms of the curves appear to indicate a compara-

tively sudden burst of seismic energy at each great paroxysm, and (by

their flat tops or more sloping lines to the right hand) a more gradual

subsidence, as if the train of causes required time to regain, after one spent

paroxysm, their energy and regimen, which, when restored, were suddenly

put into action, and which, once developed, were slow in being wholly

expended and relapsing into repose.

The occurrence of such epochs at the middle, or towards the end of our

purely arbitrary subdivision of duration into centuries, must be of course

only accident. The interval of duration between one epoch and the next,

is that alone which can have a cosmical basis.

  We may then provisionally affirm the probability of two periods of earth-

-- --quake maxima a greater and a less alternately as occurring in a hundred

years, for the last three centuries of history at least. The existence of
some periodic maxima in remoter centuries can hardly be doubted, although

the epochs of the two maxima have a secular movement, and do not fall in

the same place in the older times. Anterior to the 16th century, however,

the general curves of time (Plates I. II. and III.) are, through paucity of
observations, not sufficiently " prononcees" to enable this to be asserted from

them, or to warrant the graphic representation of the epochs of occurrence

of such paroxysmal periodic maxima for the whole even of the Christian era.

   In Plate VII. fig. 2, the periods of paroxysm (number and intensity) are
summed and grouped for each successive century of our era. The 1st,

5th, 9th, 12th, and 18th centuries are those of greatest seismic develop-

ment, while the 1st and 2nd centuries a.c, and the 3rd, 7th, 10th, and

14th centuries of our era, are times of comparative repose. The numerical
value of the paroxysmal centuries (as we may term them) increases, though

not regularly, as the present time is neared, and is modified, without doubt,

by the same conditions of observation that aff'ect the expansions of the later

Wecurves of time.  dare not base any generalization upon it.

catalogue :

in July ; in the southern the minimum is more suddenly arrived at, and as

suddenly abandoned, andjit extends over less than one month.

   If we take May and June as one minimum in the northern, we have
a second but very much lower one in September, and the corresponding

second minimum for the southern hemisphere in August.
   The annual paroxysmal maximum for the northern hemisphere is di-

stinctly in January, and for the southern in November.
   January and March are second maxima in the southern, as August and

October are in the northern.
    Whatever be the irregularities month by month however, the prepon-

derance of seismic paroxysm for the whole twelve months lies amongst those

that form the winter of our northern hemisphere.
    In Plate IX. figs. 1 to 6, curves are drawn for mensual energy, for several

corresponding periods for the northern and southern hemispheres. Figs. 1
and 2 indicate these for the whole period before, and for sixteen centuries

after the commencement of our era. Here the northern minimum falls
in July, and a second minimum in October, while the southern mini-

mum falls in April, and the second before September, approximating thus

 to accordance with the curves of the whole catalogue, but less " prononcees."

 Then for later but shorter observed periods, figs. 3 and i give the mensual
 energy for a.d. 1700 to 1800, and figs. 5 and 6 for a.d. 1800 to 1850, being

 the half century in which, for convenience of comparison, the ordinate of
 time is double the scale of the other figures, the whole twelve months being
 represented by an ordinate of equal length in all.

    In the eighteenth century, then, we find in the northern hemisphere the
 minima less distinct, occurring in July and September, and the maximum in
 January, with a second maximum between October and January ; and in the
 southern hemisphere, the minima about March and September, and the
 maxima in May and December.

    Again, in the first half of this nineteenth century we have (fig. 5) the
 northern minimum in June, a second but less marked minimum between
 November and December, and the maximum again in January and Fe-
 bruary ; while in the southern hemisphere we have (fig. 6) the seismic
 minimum in March, and a second but much less marked one between July
 and August, and the maximum in November, with feeble indications of a

 second slight one in June.
     Such are, then, the results of our monthly discussion. Comparing both

 hemispheres, they show several points of general agreement, and some of

 decided want of accordance. Little comparative weight can be ascribed to
 the few observations as yet made in the southern hemisphere, where so large
 a proportion of the earth's surface is covered by the ocean, and where so

  little of the land has, until a very late date, been the subject of observational

 record at all. It would seem warrantable therefore not to permit any such

 unaccordant phenomena between the two hemispheres to obscure the strong

 presumption which the facts otherwise support, that there really is a seismic
 paroxysm in the months forming the end and commencement of the civil

 year. It may not have a natural or cosmical basis, it may possibly be one of

  the accidents inseparable from an observational catalogue ; but both this

  extended catalogue, and nearly all the partial catalogues of others, indicate

  it as a fact, and one not absolutely without some extraneous support in the

  present state of our knowledge.

    When we group the consecutive months into four seasons, spring, summer,

  autumn, and winter, and reproduce the curve of seismic energj' for the whole

 year, and separately for each hemisphere and for the whole period of the

ON TUB FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 53

catalogue, the same relation of scale as before (figs. 1 and 2, Plate VIII.)
being maintained between the northern and southern abscissae, we find
some of the apparent anomalies disappear. In fig. 1, Plate X. the curve of
season for the northern hemisphere assumes a very regular form, and gives

a decisive minimum for the summer season (in May and June), and an
equally clear maximum for the winter season (in December and January).

   In fig. 2, Plate X. the corresponding curve for the southern hemisphere,

however, still shows two maxima and two minima, the maximum at the
commencement of winter, with second maximum at midsummer; the

minima in spring and autumn assuming the months constituting the re-
spective seasons reversed in the two hemispheres. It must be borne in view,
however, that the base of induction for this hemisphere is from only 223
observations, against 5879 in the northern ; that if the southern curve had
been drawn to the same vertical scale as the northern, it would have ap-
peared to the eye as almost a straight line ; so that very little weight is to

be attached to the discordance it appears to present to the corresponding

curve, its necessarily exaggerated scale falsely addressing the eye.

    In fig. 3, Plate X., the two curves preceding are combined, but to the

same scale of vertical or of seismic abscissa ; and the result shows how little
in reality the data that we possess as yet for the southern hemisphere are"
capable of modifying the facts we have for the northern. The southern
curve, in fact, scarcelj' alters to the eye the preceding northern one ; and
the new curve of season for both hemispheres presents still the winter maxi-

mum and summer minimum.

   In fig. 5, Plate X., a curve has been obtained for the whole period of
the catalogue and for both hemispheres, representing graphically all recorded
earthquakes occurring near or at the equinoxes and solstices (the critical
epochs of Perrey and others) within a limit of twenty days, i. e. ten days be-

fore and ten days after each equinox and solstice. The base of induction is
moderately large, the catalogue containing the following numbers :

--Vernal equinox (March 10 30)        310
--Summer solstice (June 11 July 1)
--Autumnal equinox (Sept. 13 Oct. 3)  254?

Winter solstice (Dec. 1 1--31)        249

                                      318.

This we may call the equinoctial and solstitial curve of comparative seismic
energy. It indicates a distinct maximum about the winter solstice, and an
equally distinct minimum rather before the autumnal equinox. Taking the
average of the whole year for any lengthened period, it may admit of much

doubt, whether there is any real seismic paroxysm at the equinoxes and sol-
stices, although a clear preponderance is shown by our catalogues at two out of

the four annual epochs at which all are recorded yet, from the accordance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

of Perrey's results with those given by this much larger base of induction,
we cannot put aside the possibility tiiat the fact may have a cosmical basis.

   The most direct connexion in such case that we should expect to find,

with other ascertained, periodical phenomena, would be with the annual

march of the barometer. In fig. 4, Plate X., the annual curves of mean
mensual barometric pressure are laid down to the same scale of ordinate for

time as the equinoctial and solstitial seismic curve below (fig. 5), giving the
variation in atmospheric pressure for places in several and distant latitudes,
Macao, Havanna, Calcutta, Benares ; and in Europe, Halle, St. Petersburg,

--Berlin, Paris, and Strasburg, the curves themselves having been reduced

from those of MM. Buch, Dove, and Kaemtz.

   On comparing these barometric curves with the seismic one, an obvious
--54 REPORT 1858.

similarity addresses the eye. Is there any real relation, however? In
the First Report (1850), p. 68, &c., I have treated of the relations of
atmospheric pressure with earthquakes, and at p. 78 have indicated a possible
link of connexion of a direct character between them, and shown how it is
conceivable that local increase of barometric pressure, and diminution simul-

taneously elsewhere, may conspire with other conditions to bring on volcanic
action, and hence earthquake; and Perrey has hinted, in his memoir on France,

p. 98 (4to), at some relation between his seismic mensual curves for Italy and
Europe, having a minimum in November, and Dove's barometric curves,
given in Pogg. Ann. for 1843, pp. 177, 201, which show something analogous

d{quelque chose analogue). Here we observe (comparing figs. 4< and 5) the

barometric minima very closely correspond with the seismic minima, and
vice versa. Bearing in mind the fact, that, as the sun gets nearer the zenith
with the advance of spring and summer, the barometer falls, and that, taking
 the whole earth together, the atmospheric pressure is less over those portions
of its surface where it is summer, and greater over those where it is winter;
 and that these differences of pressure are greater in general as the latitude
 is lower, so that simultaneously that hemispheric surface of the globe which
 is at the time most heated by the sun is also least pressed upon by the
atmosphere, and vice versa ; it seems warrantable to presume a cosmical and
 even a possibly direct connexion between the two phenomena; and this
 receives, again, some support* from the fact (though not without large
 exceptions), that on the whole the great earthquake bands of the world pass
 through low latitudes, where these barometric and thermic fluctuations are

 most developed.
    It would be worse than useless, however, to speculate minutely upon the

 physical relations of those facts, in the present imperfect state of our know-

 ledge of their connexion.

    The attempts which 1 have made to ascertain an absolute relation in
 number, from any discussion of the Catalogue, between the recurrence of
 seismic paroxysm at the equinoxes and solstices, and at an equal period of

 twenty days throughout the whole range of time, have been nugatory ; it is
 impracticable to extricate a result, in which any confidence could be reposed,

 from the observational expansion and irregularities with the advance of

 time.

   We must not be discouraged, however, that after the vast labour bestowed

 by so many, upon cataloguing earthquakes and discussing the results, we

 find these do not bring us even to the threshold of positive knowledge, and
 that the main reward of toil so far, is the having cleared away rubbish, and
 at length ascertained how far lists of facts, such as have been hitherto com-

 piled from the best available materials, are of any further use. General

  Sabine, in his Introduction to vol. iii. of the ' Magnetical and Meteorological
 Observations made at Toronto,' p. vii., when narrating the former state of

 magnetical science as compared with its present position, says, "a few of the
 German observers had begun to note the disturbance of the horizontal force

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

 but as yet no conclusions whatsoever as to their laws had been obtained :" in

 the words of the Report, " the disturbances apparently observe no law." Such
 may almost be said, as to our present knowledge of the distribution of

laws, when once reached, must shed upon terrestrial physics. The period
of mere cataloguing (like that of fossil-list making in the earlier geology)
seems now past ; we must give it up, and, in the words of Herschel, " we
must now grapple with the palpable phenomena, seeking means to reduce

their features to measurement, the measures to laws, the laws to higher
generalizations, and so, step by step, advance to causes and theories,"

(Address, Camb. 1S45.)

   Many cases are recorded in the Catalogue of Earthquakes, of shocks

occurring at two very distant places upon the earth's surface, but felt simul-
taneously, or nearly so, at both. The coincidence in time is, for all very
distant places, rendered extremely doubtful, from errors of observation and
of clocks, and of their reduction for difference of longitude when the places
are not on the same meridian.

   Milae also has collected several such instances ; for example

February 1750... England and Italy.

March  1750... England and Italy.

May    1750... England and Calabria.

August 1750. ..England and European Turkey.

February 1756.. England and Central France, Holland and the Rhine.

November 1756... Scotland and Malta.

January 1768. ..Shetland and Central England.

December 1789. ..Edinburgh and Florence.

February 1818. ..Great Britain and Sicily.

September 1833... England and Peru.

August 1834... Scotland and Italy.

September 1 SSI... England and Peru.

In these, however, the coincidence in time cannot be assured within several
hours ; and it must be admitted, with Mylne, that the probability of any-
thing more than mere coincidence is extremely slight.

    In 1840-4'1 he found three shocks of this character : viz.

       March 1840  Scotland and Germany.
       June 1841   Terceira and St. Louis.
                   Scotland and France.
       July 18il
                       (Edin. Phil. Journ. xxxi. to xxxvi.)

  A few such instances, that posses? a closer approximation in time and

some additional probability of actual coincidence, have been extracted from

the Catalogue, and have been drawn in the diagram (Plate Xiw) to scale,

those which had horizontal components of motion in the meridians N. to S.

or S. to N. being placed at the right and left sides of the great-circle section

of the globe ; and those with horizontal movement E. and W. or W. and E.,

placed above and below.
    Right lines connecting the supposed distant points of coincident shock by

chords of the circle, would probably pass through the origin or centre of

disturbance common to both places on the surface. The origin might be

deeper to any extent, and possibly somewhat nearer the surface, at least in

the cases of the longer chords. Were any reliance to be placed upon these
coincidences, some of them would thus give a depth of origin of about 800
miles below the surface. None of those, however, that appear to have any

satisfactory evidence of a real connexion in time and in origin, suggest a
depth for the latter of even one-tenth that amount. All our other know-
                         --

--56 REPORT 1858.

ledge, both of seismic and volcanic phenomena, leads to the conclusion of

foci very much nearer the existing surface ; and the diagram may be re-

garded as conclusive evidence that these presumed coincident earthquakes
at very distant points, even if proved simultaneous, are unconnected, and

have different origins.
   In the most singular case on record, that of Ochotzk and Quito, places

nearly antipodal, the common origin Avould actually be in, or not remote

from, the earth's centre ; and it is not conceivable that the shock, which, if
sufficiently powerful, must in such cases be felt nearly simultaneously over

the whole globe, should have been confined to the two extremities of a single

diameter.

   In recapitulation, it may be convenient to give in numbers, for occasional

reference, a few of the salient results of the distribution in time, already

graphically discussed :

If we double the last number but one, to embrace the entire 100 years, the

close, viz. 100 and 106, and although the series is still an expanding one,
yet as the numbers for the 16th and 17th centuries are not large; it is
probable that for the last 150 years at least, our news of all great earthquakes

--have been complete, and the cataloguing of them perfect, showing that at

present we may calculate upon 1-37 say 1-4, or nearly 1^ recurrences of
great and disastrous earthquakes every year, at some one or more places on

the earth's surface, or one great earthquake disaster every eight months.

The total number of earthquakes, classed by months, is as follows :

size, of perfect clearness and accuracy in the laying down the most complex
localities, and those in which the shocks are most numerous. This has been
reproduced to a much reduced scale (Plate XI.), to accompany the present
Report ; but although executed with much skill and care, by the lithographer
and engraver, I find with regret that its small size has rendered a perfectly

accurate transcript of the original impracticable, and that a very imperfect
notion of the latter is conveyed by the reduced map.

    Strictly, the limits of every earthquake are completely indeterminate ; and
were our globe perfectly solid, homogeneous, and elastic, no limits but its

own could be assigned to any shock from whatever centre originating. The
practical limit (so to speak) is, however, where the movement has become

insensible without instrumental aid ; for such liave been all the observations
dealt with in our Catalogue. This frequently embraces enormous surface-
areas ; but these seldom, perhaps nowhere, are symmetrically posited round
the centres, or presumed centres, of disturbance.

  We are not concerned here with any of the smaller or local circumstances

that modify, in different radii traced from any seismic centre, the effects,
and the directions and distances, to which they are sensibly transferred, but
merely with some of the greater and constant conditions (for the same region)
in which some of the great natural features of the earth's surface perma-
nently modify or limit the transference and area of transfer of earthquake-
waves transmitted from adjacent centres. Thus, along the whole chain of

--the South American Andes, the propagation of shock is greatly more

towards the west than to the eastward, the highest crests and intermediate
valleys forming a rude sort of limit, beyond which, to the eastward and into
the heart of the table-land of the continent, shocks felt with destructive
effect down to the shores of the Pacific are propagated with greatly di-
minished force, or rather are so felt upon the surface.

    Again, to take another large example, the Northern Indian earthquakes,
whose origin is in Nepaul and along the central Himalayan axis, are pro-
pagated southwards and westwards into the great plain of India, far more
than northwards into the enormous mass of table-land of Central Asia.

We are at this moment not concerned with the causes of this, but simply

with the fact, that in these examples, and in several analogous instances, it
is a matter of observation that certain great natural features of the earth's
surface and material, do modify the forms of the surface-areas shaken,
and render them unsymmetrical, shortening the radii in one direction,
lengthening them in another; so that the area, which in a more homo-
geneous mass would approach a circular or elliptic form, tends to an elon-

 gated, linear, or irregular outline.

    In laying down, then, the forms and sensible area of shock of each earth-
 quake catalogued (and often necessarily, from the imperfect data alone
 afforded), the following rules were adhered to :

    1°. When the form and sensible limits of the shaken area were ascertain-

            able from the narratives, they were adopted.

    2°. When these were wanting, as in the great mass of cases recorded, then,

              as respects form, the physical, geological, or other conditions of

            each area, known to modify the distant propagation of shock, were

              attended to.

    3°. As respects sensible area, when this could not be ascertained for

             any one diameter of the shaken area, from the narratives, certain
            arbitrary conventional rules (founded upon a natural basis, however)
             were resorted to.
                             ----

   ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 59

   The method of colouring therefore was this. The whole of the recorded

earthquakes of the Catalogue were subdivided preliminarily, with as careful
a judgment as possible, into three great classes :

    1°. Great earthquakes, being those in which, over large areas, numerous
           cities, &c., were overthrown, multitudes of persons killed, rocky
           masses dislocated, and powerful " secondary effects" produced.

   2". Mean earthquakes, or those which, although perhaps having a wide
         superficial area, were recorded to have produced much less destruc-

           tive effects upon cities, &c., and little or no changes upon natural
           objects, and scarcely any loss of life.
   3°. Minor earthquakes, limited to tliose which, although sensible and
          producing in their full development some effects (fissures, &c.) upon
           buildings, did not affect natural objects at all, and left few or no
            traces of their occurrence after the shock.

   Of the first class, the great Lisbon shock of 1755 may be taken as a
familiar type. Of the second, examples are frequent over Central Europe
and the Mediterranean basin, Southern Asiatic Russia, &c. And of the
third class we find notices almost daily from every quarter.

   As respects the very smallest development of tiiis class, namely, the con-

tinuous tremors of Comrie, Pignerol, &c. &c., they were grouped into single
shocks upon the same jnethod as described previously for their discussion as

to distribution in time.

   To distinguish these three classes upon the map, three different inten-

--sities of water-colour tint were prepared all from the same colour (red

ochre and Indian yellow). The first and most intense having been decided

to designate the first class, that for the second was obtained of one-third
the intensity, by dilution with three volumes of water ; and the third by

--dilution of the second with three volumes again, the intensities of the

Atiiree tints being therefore as the numbers 1, I; and ·^, or 9, 3, and 1.

single wash or application of the tint relative to its class, upon the given

locality, designated each earthquake when laid down on the map ; and
the form or boundary of the tint, when not to be had historically, being

ruled by physical considerations as already briefly described, the extent or

superficial area of the tint (when not derivable from the narratives), was
arbitrarily fixed by the following rule :

   4-°. The extreme radius of great earthquakes (1st class) was assumed equal
          to 9°, or about 540 geographical miles; that of the 2nd class at 3°,
           or 180 geographical miles ; and that of the 3rd at a single degree, or
           60 geographical miles.

    These were determined from the consideration that our records give,
when viewed with a broad glance and apart from physical and local limiting
conditions of a powerfully disturbing character ; i. e. when the area of dis-

--turbance has had a sensible surface-boundary approaching to an irregular

circle or ellipse, a sensible diameter of about 1000 to 1200 miles for great
earthquakes, and about 400 for those of our second class, those minor
ones of the third seldom extending to above 100 or 150 miles in diameter.

    In the case of the enormous surface-areas of the first class, however, it
has rarely been necessary, in the later years of the catalogue period, to
make use of this convention at all, the historic boundaries being usually
attainable. These in many cases comprise areas of sui-prising extent: thus
the great Nepaul earthquake of 1833 extended sensibly over 7° lat. by
                        --

--60 REPORT 1858.

15° long., a surface four times that of Great Britain, and twice and a half

that of France.

   The Cutch earthquake of 1819 extended from E. to W. 5°, and frona

N. to S. 6°, though its dimensions in latitude are rather ill-defined. (' Asiat.

Journ.' vol. xii. n. s.)

   The Lisbon (1755) earthquake, and a few of those of the Malayan and
Calabrian groups, and of South America, were sensible in certain surface-

radii or great circles over 18°, or perhaps even 20° ; but these are the extreme
developments of our first class, and their limits historical, and therefore not

affecting the preceding conventions. Some earthquakes recorded in the
catalogue it was necessary to omit laying down upon the map at all, inasmuch

as no sufficient data could be gathered to fix a probable local surface centre,
nor any information as to the comparative energy of the movement. For
example, some earthquakes (though but few) will be found catalogued as
" in China," " in Libya," &c., with scarcely any particulars given. These
omissions are not sufficiently numerous to affect the main result.

    Besides these inseparable elements, volcanic and seismic phenomena, an-
other intimately related phenomenon has been marked, as far as the data
enable it. Those tracts of the earth's surface which have been presumed,
with more or less probability, to be in slow process of subsidence to a
lower level, are marked by blue tints, the boundaries of which are un-
defined to a great extent. These embrace the coral tracts of Darwin, the
west coast of Greenland, and a small tract of the southern shores of the
Baltic. All minor subsiding areas close to or in the midst of volcanic centres
(such as the shore of Italy near Naples) are unnoticed, as such changes of
level, due to the immediate action of adjacent valcanoes, are almost per-

petual, and, in proportion to its state of activity, &c., common to every such

area over the globe.

   On examining the Mercator map (Plate XII.), then, upon which, subject

to the above rules, the whole Catalogue has been graphically rejiresented by
tinting, it is to be remarked that

   1. The whole of the earth's surface known to be subject to earthquakes
           will be found tinted more or less intensely.

   2. The most deeply tinted surfaces mark the places where either the

           number, or the intensity, or both, of successive earthquakes are the

              greatest.

   3. Whether at any one point the depth of tint be due to number or to
          intensity, and the relation between these, may be found by reference

            to the Catalogue itself.

   4. The shading- off or evanescence of tint towards the extreme sensible
          limits of the seismic (coloured) regions over the whole map is due

            (not to shading or evanescence of colour in the artist's sense, but)
           to the superposition of tints only upon the principles already ex-

          plained. Hence it follows (admitting the two conventions made, as
           to intensity and area, and the partial extent to which these in-
           fluence the results historically gotten), that the tinting upon this
          seismographic map does as truly represent, over our earth, the known
            seismic regions in form and extent, and the relative intensities and

            successive developments of seismic action therein, as the contour

          lines of a contoured map represent the forms of irregular surfaces,

           and the rate of inclination of the slopes and valleys by their ap-
            proximation or separation ; or as truly as (upon certain engraved

          maps, e.g. Irish Railway Commission of Ireland and some German

            ones) the relative heights and rapidity of rise of mountain chains are

           graphically represented by multiplying the engraved lines that pro-
           duce the shades (or tints) in tlie joint ratio of the heights and rates
           of slope, i.e. as the sines of the angles upon a given base.

 --I therefore venture to present this map as more than a mere picture as

being, in fact, a first approximation to a true representation of the distri-
bution of earthquake forces, so far as they are yet known, over the surface

of our world.
   Tlie volcanoes (including fumaroles and solfataras) are shown by black

dots, and all that are known to be in activity, or are recorded to have been
so, or from other evidence may be presumed to have been so, within the

historic or late geologic periods, have been represented, from the authorities

of Johnston, Berghaus, V. Hoff, Daubeny and others.
   The exactitude of the number of volcanic vents along the great lines of

foci, is, however, less important to our object than the marking in of isolated

volcanoes.

   Let us now examine our map in detail, and see what it can teach us, taking

for the starting-point of our seismic survey the meridian of Greenwich, the
central point nearly of the dry land, and passing eastward in our review.
l?ut first let us notice some points in the physical features of the earth's sur-

face. Of the 111,000,000 of square miles of ocean (in round numbers)

covering three-fourths of the surface of our globe, the greater part is to us a
blank, so far as direct observation is concerned, the exceptions being the

Atlantic with a part of the Southern Ocean from about 10° S., northwards,

--and of the Northern Ocean up to nearly 70° N., nearly all other marine

seismic observations being in connexion with centres upon adjacent land.

   We see these enormous pelagic areas, consisting of irregular, saucer-

shaped, shallow depressions, bounded by flowing coast-lines which, by the
connecting points of oceanic banks and islets, we can generally unite into

--closed curves, forming thus distinct but inosculating basins of which the

Northern and Southern Pacific together form the largest example. Those
vast but comparatively very shallow depressions may, when viewed in indi-
vidual detail, be subdivided into smaller shallow concavities by banks and
shallows below the ocean surface. But each great oceanic saucer, bounded
by the existing continents and their fragmentary outliers, presents an almost
continuous fringe around, of mountain-chains and volcanic foci. Thus, start-
ing from Mount Elias, long. 141° W., lat. 60°, at the northern extremity of
the Pacific, we find a scattei-ed chain of volcanoes along the west coast of
 North America, with a continuous bounding coast line of mountains. South
 of the gulf of California, the Mexican and Central American volcanoes, with
 those of the South American Andes, carry on a closely linked chain, almost
 to its southern extremity. Here the volcanoes of Tierra del Fuego trace the
 line on towards that of Graham's Land, where it plunges into the unknown

 regions of the Antarctic continent.

    Returning to the extreme north again, from Mount Elias, we have the

 almost unbroken line of mountain and volcano of the Aleutian Archipelago;
 carried down through the great elevated peninsula of Kamtschatka, the Kurile

 Isles, Jesso, Japan, the Philippines; and to the north of New Guinea by its
 volcanoes and those of New Britain, the Solomon Isles, Egmont, New He-
 brides, New Caledonia, and New Zealand, to the Antarctic ice again at the

--Balleny Islands and Buckle Volcano a connected belt, with the exception

 of the unknown Antarctic region, round its vast pelagic circuit. Within
 this the subordinate or secondary basins are marked, though less distinctly,

 by lines of volcanic foci: thus from Japan to New Ireland through the

 Ladrone Islands, a distinct though sparse line of volcanoes cuts off the basin
--62 REPORT 1858.

 (nearly one-half the area of Africa) bounded on the north by Japan, and on
 the west by the Philippines.

    From lat. 30° S., a sub-oceanic crest-line of shallows appears to spur off

eastward from the volcanic foci of New Caledonia and New Zealand, and,

trending westward and a little northward through the Tonga, Society, Mar-

 quesas, and Gallapagos Islands, connected by continuous baniis, joins the Cen-
tral American group of volcanoes, thus cutting the great ocean basin

--nearly into two secondaries, each of which is probably in a less marked man-

ner subdivided, the northern sub-basin, by a line through Christmas and
the Sandwich Islands, to some point of the volcanic group of the Andrea-
nofsky Islands in the Atlantic Archipelago, making in its course a wide
sweep to the east and north through an almost continuous chain of isles and
banks; and the southern sub-basin by a line from the Society Islands
through Easter Isle and Juan Fernandez, and combining with the great

Chilian volcanic chain at its eastern extreme.

   A vast fissure (noticed by Humboldt), and marked by an almost continuous

line of volcanic vents, extends in a direction nearly east and west, right across
Mexico, between lat. N. 18° and 19°. It is nearly 500 miles in length. Its
main direction, if produced, bears upon the volcanic island of Revillegigedo,

and, as Humboldt also thinks, probably extends to Mouna Roa, in the Sand-
wich Islands. The Mexican extremity of this enormous crevasse probably

marks the continental end of one of the great dividing ridges of the sub-

basins of the Pacific.

    Within the great Pacific Basin will be found (tinted blue) most of those
great areas of probable subsidence indicated by Darwin*. These bands will
be observed occupying the great sub-basins of the ocean, not very distant
from great volcanic lines, and although not (with our present imperfect
knowledge of soundings) quite free from the suspicion of occasionally inter-

secting such lines (e.<;r. Marquesas and Society Islands, Ladrone, and New

Guinea), yet, on the whole, keeping surface positions intermediate to the
volcanic cinctures adjoining or around them.

   Less distinctly we may trace the cincture of mountain- and volcanic chain

around the shallower Atlantic basin, and, through it, upon the submarine
elevations dividing its sub-basins. Thus, starting from Iceland ; the Ferro
Isles, Scotland, and the mountains of Wales and England (with the breach
of the English Channel, a narrow line in relation to the scale of our present
survey), the Rhenish-German chains, the French and Western Alps, tlie
Pyrenees, to Cape Finisterre and the coast of Portugal, connect by the
Azores, and by innumerable submarine rocks and shoals, across to New-
foundland. Here the lines to the northward may be pronounced unknown,
until, returning back to Iceland, we find it approximates to the point we
left through the great igneous and abrupt coast-line of Greenland.

   In connexion with this oceanic basin, we have two probably subsiding
tracts of land--the one in Davis's Straits, the other in the Baltic-- both tinted

blue.

   The Central Atlantic forms a Avell-marked basin girded with volcanoes and

mountain-ranges. Leaving the last stated boundary-line at Newfoundland,
and going again eastward to the Azores, thence through Madeira to the
Canary Isles, the Cape de Verds and including the great sub-oceanic vol-
canic region between 15° and 30° long. W., and lat. 3° N. to 10° S., going

westward by the island of Fernando Noronha to Cape St. Roque on the ex-
treme east of the South American continent, returning to Newfoundland,

we trace the line southwards through the several chains of the United States
down into Georgia, where, with the comparatively narrow breach of Lower
Florida, it is carried on hy Cuba and the whole chain of volcanic islands of
the West Indies to Trinidad and the South American continent again.
The Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea form a smaller but separate basin.
In the southern Atlantic we can trace a dividing ridge through South

-- --Ascension the great suboceanic tract just referred to North Ascension,

St. Helena, and probably to Cape Negro on the African west coast, and
thence to the Cape of Good Hope, and returning westward by Tristan
d'Acunha, thence S.W. to the Isle of Georgia (lat. 55° S.) and through the
Falkland Islands to the volcanoes of the southern point of South America;
but this, like the sub-basins, through the scattered indications which alone
we yet have in the vast southern portion of the Eastern or Indian Ocean west

of Australia, is uncertain.

   There is little doubt that Australia, on its northern existing coast-line, was

once united with New Guinea and the Aru Islands west and south of it

(Wallace, Sillimau's Journal, vol. xxv.), and possibly with much of tlie land
outlying to the west of that vast and now isolated continent ; if not, the
intermediate seas would be much deeper than they are, and the west coast of
Australia with its mountainous chains would bound an ocean basin whose

western boundary would be marked by a line of volcanoes from New Guinea
to New Zealand and the Southern Sea.

   The seas of Ochotsk, of Kamtschatka, of Japan, and, above all, the Chinese
and Malayan Seas with Borneo in the midst, form so many distinct basins,
small relatively to the vast areas we have been reviewing, but distinct and
strongly marked. In the Chinese Sea we have a probable tract of subsiding
land, tinted blue upon the evidence of Darwin. The bay of Bengal, well-
marked all round northward from Sunda, and belted with volcanoes to the
Ganges, and with mountains near the coast thence to Ceylon, joins probably
Western Australia by a suboceanic ridge, indicated through the rocks of
Greville and Compton, the Island of Apaluria v/ith the adjacent submarine

volcano of 1789, and the ocean shallows and soundings, about 100° W.

long, and 20° to 25° S. lat.

   The separate basin of the Arabian Sea is equally distinct, from Cape
Comorin along the Malabar coast, all highly mountainous, Beloochistan to
the mouth of the Persian Gulf (itself a small basin), thence by the Arabian
coast-line to the volcanic region at the mouth of the Red Sea, and into
Abyssinia with its characteristic and enormous crater-form lake of Tzana

(though as yet not possessing any earthquake record), and thence through

regions scarcely known upon the East African coast, crossing to the Comoro

--Islands (volcanic) and to the mountainous regions of Madagascar, the vol-

canic islands of Bourbon, Mauritius and Rodriguez, the Nazareth and Saya
banks, the Chagos Ai'chipelago and the Maldive and Laccadive Islands,
completing the cincture with tlie Malabar coast again.

   Along the great band of these islands, and thence trending westwards by
the Saya bank, lies one of the great tracts of ocean-floor which Darwin has
shown to be probably subsiding (tinted blue). Assuming that this really is
a band of subsidence, it would be more probable that the volcanic girdle
takes a wider sweep to the south and west of this band, and, leaving the
Island of Rodriguez, makes for the volcanic centre marked in the ocean at
long. 90° E., lat. 10° S., and thence turns northward to join Ceylon, Cape
Comorin and the volcanic region of Pondicherry,

   Leaving the great ocean and great continent, we trace smaller basins

(or rather saucers, for their extreme shallowness in relation to their surface-
area must never be lost sight of), where larger portions of the elevated raoun-.

tain-cincture, studded here and there with volcanic vents, are found unsub-
nierged and inland (i. e. where the basin within its boundary is partly land
and partly water), thus: iEtna, Lipari, and Vesuvius, the Apennine chain,
the southern and western Alps, the Pyrenees, and the great tableland and
axial chains of the Spanish peninsula, with the mountains of Northern Africa,
on through Pantellaria and Sicily, form one such basin. Closely connected
with this is the adjoining basin of the iEgean with the volcanic Greek Islands
the Black Sea, with the volcanic regions of Armenia and the Caucasus, form
a distinct basin extending on the north far into Russia ; the Caspian, with the
Sea of Aral and the plain of Tartary embracing Persia, another, having its

own volcanoes near the former sea, while Central Asia, so little known, seems

probably divisible into several vast saucer-like areas, north of the great table-
land, of which the great lakes and the Altai chains, with their imperfectly

described volcanoes, probably mark some parts of the cinctures, but which,
in the absence of knowledge as to relative level, it would be premature to

attempt to trace. Many of these basins further on to the north appear no

longer bounded by closed curves upon land, but to open out along the great
river-courses wliich run northward and become lost to our knowledge in the

icy solitudes of northern Asiatic Russia.

    Northern Europe presents us with the great Scandinavian, German, and
Russian saucer, whose features have been made so clear to us by the labours
of Murchison and others; while, further north and west, a distinct oceanic
basin appears in the Northern Sea, of which the Norwegian chain, Shetland,
the Ferro Islands, Iceland, the west coast of Greenland, and the volcanic
islands of Jan Mayen, are the marked boundaries.

     North America, so far as its surface has been ascertained, is divisible into
 several well-marked shallow basins, the most obvious being those of the
 Mississippi ; of the Arctic Highlands ; the two deserts east and west of the

 Rocky Mountains (lat. S0° to 40° N.) ; and of the great lakes, to which may

 be added hereafter Labrador and the North of Canada with Hudson's Bay;
 the eastern talus of the great Atlantic slope falling into the boundary of the

 Atlantic basin. Enough, however, has probably been stated to indicate

 that, viewed upon the broadest scale, the surface of our globe consists, as
respects its present solid surface, of a number of saucer-like depressions,

 when large, having also cotivex central areas, all having plan outlines
 approximating to extremely irregular ovals or other closed curves, and
 bounded by mountain-chains or mere rounded or flat-topped ridges or eleva-
 tions of the solid sphere, greater or less. Where three or more of these inoscu-

--late, the point between the junction is most frequently a group of mountains

 or a high tableland, or both, as, for example, the knots (Cusco and others)
 of the South American Andes, upon which the suboceanic ridges abut.

 The greatest of these saucer-like concavities either form or subdivide the
 beds of the ocean, but other such shallow basins can be traced upon the

 existing land, and embracing seas or parts of seas, or great lakes, or river-
 courses within them, but still enclosed by girdling chains of mountains or

 the precipitous flanks of tablelands, which latter in their full development

 are the pedestals of the greatest mountain-chains. Amongst the wide-
 sweeping curves that indicate the dividing crests (if we may use such a

 word to designate elevations often, especially/ in the subdividing ridges of the
 oceanic suh-hasins, so very low in relation to the areas they separate) of these
 vast oceanic basins, it appears impossible to trace any approach to parallelism,
 or, indeed, that such an arrangement could exist.

   We do, however, remark, that it is along these girdling ridges, whether

 mountain-ranges or mere continuous swelling elevations of the solid, which
 divide these basins beneath the ocean surface one from the other, that all
ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OP EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 65

the volcanoes known to exist upon the earth's surface are found, dotted

along these ridges or crests in an unequal and uncertain manner.

   And as our oceans and greater seas are bounded, and below their water-

surface subdivided, by these ridges, along the lines of which the volcanic

foci are found ; so, as long observed, it is a fact that all active volcanoes are
comparatively close to the sea, or to some large body of water; indeed,

they could not present the phenomena they are known to do, without a

supply of water, and nearly always of sea-water, more or less constant and

plentiful, derived from this propinquity. (See Trans. R. I. Acad. vol. xxi.

pp. 98, 99.)

   However different, then, may have been the train of forces upon which the

elevation of the mountain-chains and other relatively raised lines of the pre-

sent surface have depended, from those which now produce the ejections

thrown up by volcanic action, the latter seem to follow upon the traces of
the former ; and we shall find that the earthquake generally does so likewise.
The distinction long made, into linear and circularly grouped or clustering

volcanoes, I conceive has no foundation in nature. By far the largest pro-

portion of all the volcanic vents over the whole earth are found arranged

along the flowing lines of mountain-chains.

   The so-called clusters or circular groups never are found covering surface-
areas larger, if so large, or more widely apart, in any single group, than those

within which volcanic vents are found that undoubtedly belong to linear ar-
rangements (Mexico for example).

Nearly all the clusters or circular groups of volcanoes are situated in the

ocean, and far from continental land ; they stand on, and are connected with

each other, by oceanic plateaux, rounded submarine ridges, shallows, rocks,

and islands, and by similar connexions with points of continental coasts,

either mountainous or volcanic. The conclusion seems justifiable, that

these clusters or groups are the only visible points, "few and far-between,"

situated along sub-oceanic linear volcanic ranges, along which the open

vents are probably much fewer than along equal lengths on land, but still

marking as truly as the most thick-set linear vents the great lines of fracture

of the earth's crust. Werfe this the proper place, much might be adduced

in support of this view of volcanic distribution.

The connexion between volcanic and seismic effort is so obvious, although

the nature of their connexion has been so little understood, that we are

prepared to find the deepest tints of the seismic map fringing off from those

great mountain-ranges where the volcanic foci stand close in rank ; but it
was not before so apparent that, along the elevated ridges or mountain-

ranges that gird and divide the great surface-basins, even when not volcanic,
or when volcanic foci are rare and widely separated, the earthquake is still

found to range in broad bands, following" the general line of the crest.

   Upon a very much minuter scale of survey than we are now occupied with,

such would seem dependent upon the physical fact, that the earth-wave

will be best and furthest propagated through the most solid and elastic line
of material, that is, in the axial line of mountain-chains and valleys, as is

found to be the case ; but the indication of our map is a far more extensive
one, and points to some different and deeper cause. Thus, to resume our
seismic survey of the Map, Iceland, Ferro, Shetland, and the south-west
coast of Norway, nearly to Christiania, form a broad band of seismic con-

nexion, which would probably run on to Greenland, and along its coast to
Jan Mayen, did we know anything of their earthquake history.

   The fact (if it be so), that the west coast of Greenland, in Davis's Straits,

is sinking gradually, would in nowise conflict with the probability of

1858,                                              J.
--66 REPORT 1858.

seismic action, or even elevation of the opposite eastern coast, which, it is

extremely probable, may be slowly rising, just as the Scandinavian peninsula
is doino- ; and it does not seem a disproportioned supposition, that all three

changing levels are due to the prodigious scale of volcanic action going on

at Iceland.

   The Swedish system is another band stretching north-west from tlie
great lakes to Kola Bay in Russian Lapland ; and future observation may
probably include in it the parallel chain of the Doff'refels Mountains. To
the south we mark the broad band whose extremities are Portugal and the

Azores, always in seismic sympathy with each other, and with which the
band of the Canaries is in relation through Madeira, and is also more
distinctly connected with the earthquakes of Barbary and Morocco.

   From Tunis, a narrow but intensely marked seismic band sti-etches up

through Sicily and Italy, sends off a spur to the west through the Alps of
Piedmont and Southern France, along the whole line of the Pyrenees,
and to the northern coast of Spain ; and widening out over the central Alps,
so as to cover a large area of central Southern Europe : extending east and
west from Lyons to Vienna, it again contracts in width at about the latitude
of Strasburg, and stretches aM'ay northwards over the whole Rhenish
mountain system, and becomes nearly evanescent upon the low plains of
Holland and the coasts of the North Sea, where, though infrequent, earth-
quakes are not unknown.

    Over the great plain of Central Europe, and far into Southern Russia to
the north of the Euxine, the want of observations with distinct dimensions
renders any attempt at precise boundary nugatory. Were our records better,
the Carpathians would no doubt stand out in stronger tint than the well-
inhabited country of Poland and the Vistula, where the greater frequency of
seismic records deepen the tint from Cracow up towards Riga. Better ob-
servations would no doubt also mark with a deeper tint a band of connexion
along the Balkans and line of the Danube, between the Austrian Alps, so
frequently shaken, and the Bosphorus, where the neiglibourhood of Con-
stantinople shows itself abnormally intense, from the reiterated records of

Iearthquakes there that have been collected century alter century at that

ancient seat of splendour and civilization. Thus it is that the disturbing
causes that we have remarked as aflecting the Catalogue follow into its dis-
cussion in space as well as we have seen they do into that of time.

  A broad but somewhat ill-defined seismic band stretches from the Greek

Archipelago to Constantinople, spreads over a large portion of Asia Minor,

and is carried through Palestine, on to the valley of the Lower Nile and the
coasts of the Red Sea, extending further south along its Arabian shore.
From the Gulf of Scanderoon, by Aleppo and Mosul to Lake Van, and
the south of Ararat to Shirvan and Baku upon the Caspian, a wide band
of great and long-continued energy extends, which probably joins into the

Caucasus and is connected with the seismic system of the Ourals in the

distant north.

    Again, from about the parallel of Bagdad, a broad but ill-defined seismic

band stretches nearly due east through the whole of Persia, Khorassan, and
to tlie Hindoo Koosh, sending off a narrower band along the shores of the

--Persian Gulf. About Cabool the Persian band joins into the vast seismic

area of Northern India a band, whose northern boundary is the Hima-'
layan chain, and which stretches nearly parallel to it from Cabool to Cal-
cutta and to the Gulf of Cutch. Beloochistan appears exempt, but probably
only because hitherto without observation or record. Leaving the vast and
strongly agitated seismic system of Central Asia, of the boundaries of which

flo little is yet known beyond tlie general fact that northwards the seismic

bands appear to follow tlie great river-courses, or more probably the great

--axes bounding them, and passing also the so frequently convulsed Chinese

empire, whicii appears to have two chief seismic centres about Pekin and

Canton (these cities have been the centres of observation for all, or nearly all,

the Chinese records of earthquakes that we possess, and hence one reason of

the depth of seismic tint around them ; but it is also to be observed that two
of the great volcanic districts of the " Fire Hills and Fire Wells" of China are

situated within the tinted or shaken regions adjacent to the two capitals),

Avith a third more central volcanic region, of which I am not aware that any-

--thing is known seismically, and remarking the apparent exemption of Cochin
--China, for which there are no records, we at length arrive at the greatest and

most formidable earthquake- and volcanic region upon our globe. Stretching

in a vast horse-shoe, convex to the south, from Burmah and Pegu, and sur-

rounding the great island of Borrieo, with an intervening belt of sea, and

reaching round to Formosa on the north-west, we have an almost continuous

girdle of volcanoes and lofty mountains. Every island of the group, in-

cluding Java and Sumatra, Celebes and Mindanao, is shaken with earth-

quakes the most formidable and frequent ; and we can point to no spots upon

the whole earth's surface upon which seismic energy is exhibited Avith an

intensity equal to tliat of Luzon and Sumbava.

Nothing even in South Ameri(!a or Mexico appears to rival the grandeur

of volcanic energy and resultant seismic action here. In 1815 the thunder-

ings of Tomboro, in Sumbava, were heard nearly 1000 miles away (through

the earth no doubt). The ashes, or, more correctly, the finely-divided tufa-

dust, floating in the air, made mid-day into darkness 300 miles away in Java,

and were precipitated at sea even a thousand miles from the point of ejec-

tion, while whole tracts of country, with inhabited towns, have suddenly

become engulphed and disappeared during periods of eruption, which over

a large portion of the chain, from one extreme to the other, are almost

continuous.

It will be remarked that the seismic tint is both more intense and rela-

tively more circumscribed in area along the bands that surround the linear

volcanic vents, where they cluster thick, than along mountain-chains or

ridges that possess few or no volcanic vents. This no doubt arises from the

centres of impulse in active volcanic lines being situated at a comparatively

small depth, in fact, coming from the actual bases of the crater, or not far

beneath                                     and hence the  liorizontal  propagation  is  not  so great for a given
                                         ;

force of impulse as where its centre is situated deeper, and the explosive

effort rendered abortive to rupture the solid crust above. The intensity of

tint in the former case is due to repetition of eflbrt, as well as to occasional

intensity of impulse.

   An earthquake in a non-volcanic region may, in fact, be viewed as an

uncompleted effort to establish a volcano. The forces of explosion and
impulse are the same in both ; they differ only in degree of energy, or in the
varying sorts and degrees of resistance opposed to them. There is more
than a mere vaguely admitted connexion between them, as heretofore com-

--monly acknowledged one so vague, that the earthquake has been often

stated to be the cause of the volcano (Johnston, ' Phys. Atlas,' Geologj-^,

p. 21), and more commonly the volcano the cause of the earthquake, neither
view being the expression of the truth of nature. They are not in the rela-

tion to each other of cause and effect, but are both unequal manifestations

of a common force under different conditions.

Further north we have the somewhat less terrible, but yet deeply-

                                                                         f2
--68 REPORT 1858.

coloured seismic bands of Japan, the Kuriles, and Kamtscliatka ; and, pass-

ing to the opposite shore of the Pacific, we are presented with the deeply-
coloured stisniic bands of Mexico and the South American Andes, whose

influence reaches far out into the ocean, but eastward or landward is

checked by the great chain. The reason of this fact, which has been before
alluded to, is not hard to find. The general section of the South American
continent, from west to east, consists of a comparatively low-lying narrow
littoral border-country on the Pacific; then the immense chain of the
Andes rising in successive ranges to the axial peaks, and beyond these a

-- --vast plateau the elevated land of the great continent reaching over to

near the western coast, where some lower ranges of mountains terminate
the Atlantic shore and bound its basin. This is rudely shown in the accom-
 panying figure (1).

   Now if a shock be transmitted from any origin within the great chain,

 and below the level of the great tableland, ab, as from a point x, the
 transmitted elastic wave in the direction xs, reaching the surface after a
 very short transit, will, in accordance with the well-known law of elastic
 bodies, have its amplitude increased (just as the last billiard-ball of a line
 of touching balls, is that which is projected when the first of the line is struck
 by the blow of a propelled ball), and more powerfully shake all surface-
 objects at s than others situated at a, although at an equal radial distance

--from the centre of effort, the free movement of the elastic wave being

 here reacted upon by the elastic mass of the tableland which blocks its way

 until compressed. Objects on the tableland, at an equal distance from

 the origin, may (dependent upon its depth) receive the shock (even if

 of only equal amplitude) at such an angle of emergence as will give a less
 power of overthrow to the horizontal component of the wave's transit.
 There will in every case be a reflected wave back from the mass of the

-- --tableland an earthquake echo producing at s, or along the littoral border,

 a second shock, with a line of direction nearly the same, but with a direction
 of motion reverse to the first, one shock only being felt on the tableland.

    To return, the seismic band of the Andes, at the extreme north of the
 continent, and at Trinidad, inosculates with that of the West India Islands,

 which sweeps round the Caribbean Sea, and appears, so far as records go,
 to transmit its movements further into the Atlantic, than into the former

--sea ; if so, that probably arises from causes quite analogous to those already

 explained for South America a shallower sea-bottom to the westward, on
 the Caribbean Sea, thus playing the part towards the deeper bottom of the
  Atlantic that the tableland plays towards the littoral slope of South America.
 The North American records have been too few and ill-defined as to boundary
 to produce as yet any very distinct conclusions from the tints, which prove,
 however, that its western and southern seaboard are by no means free from
  earthquake. This has in great part arisen from the great want of orographic

    Future observation will probably show a connexion between the great sub-
oceanic seismic tract of the South Atlantic and the South American conti-
nent on its western sea-board, between Cape Roque and La Plata. It does
not appear so far to have any connexion with the opposite African coast be-

Atween Cape Paltnas and the Bight of Biafra. better knowledge will also pro-

bably widely extend the seismic boundary of the Cape of Good Hope along

both the east and west shores of Africa to the northward, and bring within it

the great island of Madagascar, as to which nothing is so far known. New

Zealand (unhappily for its future progress) will afford one of the best regions
in the world for the study of volcanic and seismic phenomena in their con-

nexion.

   The earthquake-band of Western Australia, at present so small in propor-
tion to its vast surface, will probably be found to reach much further towards
the interior, and embrace Van Diemen's Land and a considerable stretch of

the southern coast to the eastward. It remains yet to be observed whether

even the small surface explored of the east side of the Great Island is sub-
ject to earthquakes or not. Abyssinia too, though not affording the record

of a single earthquake, is too closely united with the seism.ic region of Arabia

and the mouth of the Red Sea, to be probably perpetually in repose.
   There are great untinted spaces upon our map. The northern and south-

ern polar regions, immense tracts in North America and in Northern and
East Central Asia ; surfaces in South America nearly as large as all Central
Europe ; the whole African continent except the northern edge and southern
point; nearly the whole of Australia, and almost the whole of the bed of the
great ocean, are perfectly unstudied and unknown to us, as respects their
seismic condition. They appear white, and hence free from earthquake, upon
the map, but only because there are no observations.

    Future researches will probably, however, show that all these vast tracts of
land are traversed by earthquake-bands presenting generally the features
that we recognize elsewhere, and that the ocean-bed, far from the continents,
although always much less disturbed, for equal extent of surface, than the
land, and especially than the coast, of the great oceans, is also traversed by
earthquake-bands continuous with and tracing out their shallowest contours.

   Had navigation been, in times past, as frequent and constant in the Pacific

and Southern Indian oceans as it has been in the narrower Atlantic, especially

north of the equator, the former would most probably present, over very much

of their vast surfaces, light seismic tints such as almost the whole Atlantic
presents, included as it is within the range of movements transmitteti from
both its western and eastern borders, and also from the foci within its bosom,
connected by seismic lines so closely adjacent, i. e. with sub-basins so com-
paratively small in area.

   Imperfect as are our observations on land, they are much more so upon

the surface of the great ocean that covers three-fourths of our globe ; so
that only a very rude approximation, and from very partial data, can be

made towards the solution of the question, What is the relation of seismical

energy beneath the land and the ocean ?

   The result of Perrey's, memoir ' On the Basin of the Atlantic,' (Dijon
M6m.) assigns, for a period from 1430 to 1847, or 417 years, a total of only

about 140 shocks (or three shocks per annum) observed over an area of
about 24 millions of square miles. If we contrast this with the only tolerably
well-observed portion of the dry land, the great European area, we find
thereon at the least 40 shockr, per annum observed upon an area of 1,720,000

square miles, or (allowing for regions included, but never observed), say,
1,500,000 square miles. There occurs therefore annually in the Atlantic
--70 REPORT 1858.

basin one shock for every 8,000,000 square miles of surface, and, in the Euro-
pean area, one shock for every 37,500 square miles of surface ; so that within
these large areas the seismic energy beneath the land is to that beneath the

ocean-floor as 213 : 1 nearly. The annual number of observed European
earthquakes is certainly below the actual number that occur; and although

the Atlantic is the only oceanic surface of our globe over Avhich there can
be a pretence even to correct observation, yet its recorded numbers must
be very far indeed below the truth, and immeasurably lower in proportion
than for Europe. Making, however, every allowance for imperfect inform-
ation in the pelagic area, the disparity of relative numbers is such, as to
warrant our estimating, with some confidence, that the seismical energy is

manifested with much greater power for equal areas upon the dry land than

upon the ocean-bed.
    Should it ultimately prove a fact, as rendered probable from the beautiful

investigations of Darwin, that there are great areas of gradual subsidence now
in motion beneath the Pacific, it may still happen (though it is not probable)
that seismic or even volcanic bands may traverse such areas of subsidence,

without materially affecting their general downward movement. Although
many portions of the earth's surface now show evidences of vertical insta-
bility, either slowly, oTpersaltum occasionally, rising or sinking, these effects
are all comparatively insignificant in extent. The great formative forces,
whatever they were, upon which the elevated land of the great continents and
the depression of the ocean-beds depended, have ceased sensibly to act. The
function of the volcano and the earthquake in the existing cosmos is not crea-
tive, but simply preservative ; and vast as they appear to eye and sense, their

effects are very small in relation to the totality of the great terrestrial machine.
    If, however, such large areas of oceanic subsidence as have been supposed

really exist, they will most probably be found situated almost centrally within
the oceanic sub-basins, and hence surrounded but not traversed by seismic

bands.

    There is one fact, which is shown by the relative positions, upon this map,
of the greatest volcanic areas upon our globe (and these the most active) and
of the blue-tinted areas of probable subsidence, that is worthy of fixing our

attention.

    It will be observed that the blue bands of probable subsidence are tole-
rably adjacent to the greatest seats of volcanic activity, and that the latter
generally have subsiding areas at more than one side. Thus, in the Pacific,

the blue band is along the great volcanic girdle from Celebes to New Zealand,
and thence stretches between (and at one point may cut through) the line
of suboceanic volcanic girdles, from the New Hebrides to the Marquesas.

   Again, the great volcanic horse-shoe girdle of Sumbava is between the
blue (subsiding) area in the China Sea north of Borneo, and the blue coral
bands north of Australia, which whole continent, or at least its western and
northern parts, may probably be subsiding also. Lastly, in the north we have
Iceland and its volcanic system, between the sinking coasts of Greenland and

those of the Baltic.

   If we admit, then, as certain, that these vast tracts are subsiding, we can

scarcely withhold our belief that the subsidences are due to and are the
equivalent in bulk of the solid ejecta and exhalations of these various great

volcanic areas respectively.

   The assumed area and extent of subsidence of those supposed subsiding

tracts are, however, I apprehend, greatly overrated ; this, however, is not the
place to pursue their consideration.

   From all that has preceded (here and in former Reports), it is plain that
           --

    ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 'Jl

 nothing like one or more great general horizontal directions of seismic move-
 ment can exist upon any very large tracts of the earth's surface ; and that if

 it be even possible to assign, as proposed by M. Perrey, a general horizontal
 component for limited areas, the method does not admit of extension. The
 normal type of an elastic wave in a homogeneous solid, is only varied, so far

 as observation yet goes, by the accidents principally of material and surface,
  whether the area of disturbance be great or small.

     Nor does the seismic intensity in any part of the world, so far as originating
 impulse is concerned, seem connected with the superficial character, to the
 greatest known dcptli, of the geologic formations, beyond what connexion

 is necessarily inferential from the seismic bands (where they exist) following,
 on the whole, the lines of mountains and ridges that separate the surfaqe-
 basins of the earth, whether volcanic or not. While, therefore, the seismic
 waves diverge, from axial lines that are generally of the older rock forma-
 tions, and often of crystalline igneous rocks or actively volcanic, they pene-
 trate thence formations of every age and sort, even to plains of the most
 recent post-pleistocene clays, sands, and gravels ; and occasionally, by the
 secondary efforts of great shocks, these loose materials are shaken or caused

 to slip and gather up into new forms (as in the Ullah Bund at the mouths
 of the Indus, &c.), and so the earthquake has come to be mistakenly viewed

 as a direct agent of elevation. Its true cosmical function is the very opposite :
 it is part of the dislocating, degrading, and levelling machinery of the sur-
face of our globe, while the part of tlie volcano is restoration and renewal.

Both are, however, not creative but conservative (strange as it may sound),

and suited to the period of man's appearance and possession of the earth.
    Viewing as a whole, and in a single glance, the distribution of seismic

energy over the whole globe, it presents (so far as we yet know) a vast loop
or band round the Pacific, a more broken and irregular one around the
Atlantic, with subdividing bands and a vast broad band stretching across
Europe and Asia, and uniting them.

    Thus an apparent preponderance of seismic surface seems to lie about the
temperate and torrid zones, both northern and southern ; but extended
observation is yet required in high latitudes, and particularly in the Antarctic
ones, before we dare venture to affirm that there is a real preponderance
extending over any one or more great climatic bands or zones of the earth's

surface.

   The following are perhaps the most general conclusions that are at pre-

sent justifiable:

   1st. The superficial distribution of seismic influence over existing terrestrial

           space does not follow the law of distribution in historic time; it is not

     --one of uniformity. There is this resemblance, which, however, is

           not a true analogy, that as the distribution is paroxysmal in time,

             so it is local in space.

   2nd. The normal type of superficial distribution is that of bands of variable

           and of great breadth, with sensible seismic infiuence extending from
            5° to 15*^ in width transversely.
   3rd. These bands very generally follow the lines of elevation which mark
           and divide the great oceanic or terr-oceanic basins (saucers) of the

             earth's surface,

   ^th. And in so far as these are frequently the lines of mountain-chains,

           and these latter those of volcanic vents, so the seismic bands are
          found to follow them likewise.
   5th. Although the sensible influence is generally limited to the average
           ----

--Jrg REPORT 1858.

            width of the seismic band, paroxysmal efforts are occasionally pro-
           pagated to great superficial distances beyond it.

   6th. The sensible width of the seismic band depends upon the energy de-
           veloped, and upon the accidental geologic and topographic conditions

            at each point along its entire length.

   Yth. Seismic energy may become sensible at any point of the earth's sur-

           face, its efforts being, however, greater and more frequent as the

            great volcanic lines of activity are approached.

   8th. The surfaces of minimum or of no known disturbance, are the central

           areas of great oceanic or terr-oceanic basins or saucers, and the
             greater islands existing in shallow seas.

   The fact that certain low-lying river-basins, such as the Mississippi and

the Ganges, are the seats of earthquake disturbance, does not conflict with
the last proposition. In these cases, the impulse is propagated into the plain

from the band of the bounding ridges; and when these are very large
in relation to the basin, the breadth of the seismic band may overlap its

--whole surface, as for example in the basin of the Ganges, where the seismic

banks of the Himalaya and Vindhya mountains cover the whole plain of
Northern India.

  We have thus extracted all the information that our Catalogue, or indeed

any further cataloguing of earthquakes, seems capable of giving us ; future
research must take a more distinctly physical character. I therefore proceed
to some observations upon instrumental seismometry and the construction

of seismometers, upon which our future progress must much depend.

   Twelve years ago, at the period of the author's paper (Trans. R. I. Acad,

vol. xxi. 1846) " On the Dynamics of Earthquakes," the construction of seis-

mometric instruments appeared a comparatively easy matter; there did not

seem to be much difficulty in producing even a self-registering instrument

that should give every element of the earth-wave at the surface, whose nor-
mal velocity of propagation was then assumed to be extremely great, to
approximate to that theoretically due to the elasticity of solid rocky media,
and not to vary very materially in direction of propagation during its transit
from the origin, to any distant point of the earth's surface.

   It is only at a very recent period that experiments and observations as to
the actual phsenomena, the velocity and direction of shock, &c. have begun to
show the real difficulties of the subject; and as these are apparently not very
generally recognized, I propose pointing some of them out here, prior to

indicating the limits within which for the present, it appears to me, we must

be content to restrict our seismometric aims and instruments, and describing
what form of instrument, and in what localities placed, would appear, with

--our existing knowledge, the best to give us some information approximate

onlj", and incomplete without doubt, but yet such as can be made a safe basis
for a future higher step with more refined and comprehensive instruments. I
shall avoid as much as possible (as out of place in this Report) any mathe-
matical treatment of the subject. The antecedent history of seismometers is

in brief as follows :

   All the instruments hitherto devised or set up may be divided into two

--great classes: 1, observational, those whose motions must be observed and

recorded after each shock ; 2, self-registerinr/, which record their own past
movements however repeated, and admit of their observation at any subse-
quent period within certain limits. Each of these classes is again divided
into two sorts : a. instruments dependent upon the movements by displace-
                   --

ment of liquids ; b. those dependent upon the partial displacements of
solids. Of the first class, there have been

1 (a). That of Caeciatore of Palermo, long in use in Siciij'. It consists of a
          Mooden circular dish about 10 in. diameter, placed horizontally and
           filled with mercury to the brim-level of eight notches that face the

         cardinal points and the bisecting rhumbs between, and are cut down

         through the lip of the dish, equally in M'idtli and depth all round.

         Beneath each such notch a small cup is placed, to receive such mer-

         cury as may be thrown out of each notch by an oscillatory displace-
         ment of the main mass of mercury, due to a general oscillation of the

         whole system. Either the volume or the weight of mercury found in
         each cup is supposed to measure the value of the displacement, and

            hence of the shock in its direction in azimuth.

         suggested for use by Mr. Babbage.

         tilled with some heavy and permanently coloured liquid of deep tint.

't (a). Tubes partially filled with mercury, -shaped, with the horizontal

     --ponent of shock ; and U-shaped for the vertical component, both

         sets being provided with marking indices, to show previous displace-

         ment of the mercury. (Mallet, Admiralty Manual, sect. vii. p. 214.)

         the bob a stile partly immersed in a stratum of dry fine sand spread

         to uniform thickness over the concave surface of a circular dish
         placed beneath, marked to the cardinal points, whose centre is

         beneath the point of suspension of the pendulum when at rest, and
         whose concavity is that of a spherical segment of a radius equal to
         the length of the pendulum and stile, plus rather more than the
         depth of the stratum of sand. It was supposed that the stile would
         mark a right line when seen in a plane vertical to the sand-bed, and

            in the direction of the shock.

G (b). The inverted pendulum, held vertical when at rest by its forming
          part of a spring at the base (like the watclimakers' noddy), armed

         with a chalk tracer or pencil above the bob, marking a line or lines
         upon the concave lower surface of a dish in form like that of the
         preceding. This was understood to be one of the instruments adopted
         by the observers of the repeated shocks of Comrie, &c., and the in-
         vention, in its improved form, of Prof. J. Forbes. (Phil. Trans. Edin.

         The inverted spring and ratchet pendulum seismometer, proposed in
         1854 by Robert F. Budge, Esq. of Valparaiso, in a letter (12th March
         1854) to Mr. Patterson of Belfast, and obligingly forwarded by him to
         the author. Four cylindrical or square rods of spring steel, each carry-
         ing a spherical bob (an iron shot) at top, are fixed vertically. Each is
         provided with a ratchet, finely cut upon the rod, and a pall, the planes

         of motion of the four palls passing through the cardinal points, so that

         each spring pendulum is free to make one semioscillatio7i only in its

         own direction, or that of its ratchet and pall, and be arrested there

         by the latter until its position of di^iplacemont be observed and it be
         p Wreleased. Thus, in the figure (2),
                                                is the spring pendulum (which,

         it may be remarked, would be better a flat ribbon of spring steel.

this to be in the N. and S. vertical plane,

a shock from the S. may bring the pen-

dulum into the position p m, when the

pall will fall into that r n, and detain the

instrument in its new position until the

Wangle np can be observed.

    The main object proposed by the author

of this modification of the inverted pen-

dulum was, that the observable movement

of the instrument should be as nearly as
possible that of the horizontal component
of shock, without being perplexed with
indications due to subsequent abnormal
motions of the instrument.

8 (b). The pendulum seismometer of Santi.

Two pendula suspended close to the faces

of two walls, ranging in vertical planes

traversing through the cardinal points,       2r<-
are free to oscillate in those planes only.

Each is provided with a chalk tracer, which marks the arc of oscil-

lation N. and S. or E. and W., or vice versa us to either, upon the pre-

pared lace of the wall. This has been long in use in Italy. The length

of the horizontal chord of the arc traced is assumed to be equal to

the horizontal component of shock in the direction marked, and inter-

mediate movements are to be obtained from comparison of the lengths

         of both cardinal chords by the known laws of compounded motions.

A9 (i). vertical inverted spring pendulum, formed of an elastic rod (wood

or cane), with bobs of iron shot, is fixed within a hoop, with certain

extemporaneous means of marking its oscillations in any plane, or

more than one, for horizontal component. Such pendula, fixed hori-

zontally in a wall, or in two N. and S. and E. and W. walls, may be

used for vertical element, or a shot hung from a spiral spring of wire

(Mallet, Admiralty Manual, sect. vii. p. 217, 218.); these were in-

tended for extemporaneous use. The spiral spring arrangement has

had several different proposers, some anterior to the above.

    Such are the principal instruments of the first class, used or proposed,

in addition to which may be noticed the balanced circular dish, or wheel-

--formed seismometer, suggested, I believe, by Professor J. Forbes and Col.

James, R.E., a disk of cast-iron or other metal with a heavy rim, upon a
central point of suspension slightly above the centre of gravity, and provided
with a central tracing-stile, either above or below. The sensibility and power

of horizontal recovery or stability of this instrument are nearly identical

with those of the common balance. It is liable to all the objections that

apply to pendula, Avhose properties in oscillation it still partakes of; and it
is difficult to see any one special advantage offered by it.

   Of the second class, or self-registering seismometers, the number is much

more limited.

1 (a). The first completely self-registering seismometer proposed, the author
           believes to have been that invented by himself, an account cf which

was read to the Royal Irish Academy in June 1846 (Trans. R. I. A.,

--xxi. p. 107). It consists essentially of five fluid pendula, glass tubes,

partially filled with mercury, four for horizontal, and one for vertical

elements of the shock. The displacement of the mrrcurial columns

breaks contact, in an otherwise closed galvanic circuit, which, acting

upon some simple contrivances, cause a pencil to trace a line upon

ruled paper, whose length is proportionate to the time that contact

remains broken, or to the amplitude and altitude of the earth-wave.

The ruled paper, placed upon a cylinder, is maintained in motion
by a clock ; the position of the commencement of the pencil line
traced on the moving paper, therefore, gives the moment in time, of
the arrival of the wave, or initial instant of shock. The displace-

ment of the mercurial colunms is dependent upon inertia, and on

the relative mass of mercury in the adjacent limbs of each bent

tube,

(a). Professor Palmieri, of Naples, has, some time since, constructed an

instrument, in point of general principle, very similar to the pre-

ceding, and which has been at work, as he informs me, with satis-
factory results, at the Royal Meteorological Observatory upon Vesu-

Yiufi, and for a considerable period. His instrument consists of two

distinct systems, one for vertical, the other for horizontal, or rather

undulatory movements. The former consists of a clock, constantly

Agoing, and registering date and time.  galvanic circuit, which

includes an electro-magnet, remains always unclosed, except at the

instant of the arrival of a vertical movement of the whole instrument,

when one pole of copper or platinum wire, held suspended from a heavy

--bob at the lower end of a spiral spring as in 9 {b), last sentence

close over the surface of a mercurial cup (the other pole), drops by

inertia, and making good the contact, establishes the electro-magnet's
action, and by it stops the clock and rings a bell. The range of ver-
tical movement is, I believe, deduced from the direct motion of this

contact-maker.

   The system for horizontal (?) or undulatory movements consists of
a similar clock and galvanic arrangement, and of four U-shaped

glass tubes, open at both ends, and containing equal vertical columns

of mercury. The vertical planes of two of these U -tubes are N. and
S. and E. and W. ; those of the other two in intermediate rhumbs.

Close above, but not in contact with, the mercurial surface in one

limb of each tube, is held suspended a platinum pole, the mercury

itself being the other pole of the open circuit. Upon the surface of

the mercury in the opposite limb a small float rests, connected by a

silk cord over a pulley in a vertical plane, with a little counterpoise,

slightly heavier than the float. If, now, such a movement be given

to any one or more of these U -tubes as shall kant it over or throw it

out of plumb, and so alter the relative levels of the opposite surfaces
of mercury in the two limbs of the tube, the (J-tube that shall in-

cline towards the limb that contains the platinum galvanic pole will

then make contact, and at the moment of doing so will stop the clock

and ring a bell as before.

   The amount of displacement as to level of the two surfaces of
mercury in the opposite limbs will be made observable by the

distance to which the small float shall be found elevated above the

Asurface of the mercury in the opposite limb.  description of this

instrument has been given, but without a figure, in De la Hive's

          Kreil of Vienna, of which an account appeared in 1855. This in-
         genious and simple instrument can hardly be made intelligible more
         briefly than in the author's own words, which 1 translate (with the
          addition of a word or two) from the 'Sitzungsberichte derKais. Akad.

contains clockwork, which obliges it to
turn round upon the bar of the pendulum

(as its perpendicular axis fixed with reference to rotation) once in 24 hours.
It is covered with paper or other material, which can be marked on without

great pressure. It contains on the lower edge the numbers of the hours,
which can move behind an index m, fastened to the plate h I, which is

fixed to the axis of the pendulum. Upon a neighbouring pin, op, is an
elastic and thin arm of brass, o n, which carries a pencil at" n, which, by
means of a screw (spring ?), can be pressed against the cylinder and removed

from it. It is in firm contact with this, and marks upon it an uninterrupted

line so long as the pendulum remains at rest; if, however, this begins to
swing, in consequence of the whole system being shaken, this line will be
broken, and strokes produced which will have a horizontal direction if the
pendulum swings in the plane of w o, but will be perpendicular and cross-
ways if swinging in the plane perpendicular to n o. The force and length of

instrument, and conversing with its distinguished inventor, as to its principles and construc-
tion. Prof. Palmicri informed me that it had hecn arrested hy the cclehrated shock of

16th Decemher 1857, and had given indications that he deemed satisfactory. [R. M., May

tliis stroke will give an approximation to the strengtii of the shocks. The

middle of the stroke, or, if they are vertical, the end of the uninterrupted

line, gives the time of the commencement of tiie shock. The strength and
direction of the shocks may also be approximated if the (as respects rota-
tion) fixed plate /tiA/have an annular recess, filled with quicksilver until
its surface reaches the holes SS5, made in the cylindrical sides. At the
first motion of the pendulum, the quicksilver will be shed out through these
holes into a dish divided into the same number of compartments as there are
holes, like those already in use in many existing instruments of this kind

(Cacciatores)".

   Such are the chief seismometers hitherto proposed. They all involve in
some form the principle either of the solid or of the fluid pendulum, the

latter term being applied to the oscillations of liquids in tubes or other such
vessels ; and have disadvantages, both theoretic and practical or constructive,
which render their indications inaccurate.

    Every pendulum seismometer has a time of oscillation due to its length,
which in the case of the solid pendulum is

              -VI9

and in the case of the oscillating liquid

I being the length of the pendulum and of the oscillating column of liquid

=Prespectively ; but if  the period of the earth-wave or shock, then when-

ever T=P, or w x P, or --P , the indication of the instrument will be in excess

                                     n

of the horizontal component of the wave's motion ; when, on the contrary, T

represents no function of P, it may be much less than it.

The amount of error depends also upon the velocity of movement of the

horizontal component of the wave. If this be considerable, the solid pen-

dulum, whether hanging or inverted, acted on by gravity or elasticity, is at

the first moment left behind ; as the rod becomes more oblique, the pen-

dulum is dragged along, and acquires a velocity (in a direction which ap-

proaches to horizontal) greater than that due to the arc through which the

pendulum has fallen in the time. At the end of the wave's forward move-

ment, then, the pendulum is thrown forward too far ; and at the end of the
return movement of the wave, it moves beyond the range of the latter, by a
small arc due to its proper motion. This objection applies, though with less

cogency, to the fluid pendula, and in their case to both the vertical and hori-

zontal components of the wave.

   These discrepancies of indication will vary whenever the velocity and di-

mensions of the earth-wave become altered ; and as, for the same instrument,

T varies with sin" X (X being the latitude), it is obvious that even two per-

fectly similar instruments at stations north and south of each other, will not

give strictly comparable results for the same earth-wave.

   These are but examples of one or two points of theoretic difficulty, to
which others might be added, and which affect these instruments prin-

cipally as indicators of the dimensions of the earth-wave. Some of these
theoretic disturbances may be eliminated by calculation from the results

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but there are also some apparently insuperable difficulties, of a practical or

constructive nature, which affect all solid pendula as reliable indicatora even

--of the direction of surface -transit (liorizontal component) of tlie earth-wave.

However finely suspended the pendulum if acted on by gravity only, or,
however constructed if by elasticity or by elasticity and gravity, it is found
impracticable to produce an instrument that shall make even the second half

of its very first complete vibration strictly in the plane of the original dis-
turbance, i. e. in that of the wave's transit. If, for example, any one of the

Fig. 4.

         I

instruments 5 (b), 6 (b), or 7 (b), be caused to make a semivibration by a
movement of the nature of one horizontal jerk, and strictly in one vertical
plane a b (fig. 4), the trace made will in most instances be found thus ; c d, the
first semivibration, is made sensibly in the plane of movement, but the re-

turning complete vibration de, is found diverging from it through a sensible
angle cde. If the vibration of the instrument be suffered to continue, its trace
rapidly becomes an extremely elongated ellipse, whose excentricity constantly
diminishes, as well as the actual dimensions of both its axes, until the in-
strument comes to rest, after tracing thus a mass of elliptic spirals, from
which nothing certain can be gathered as to direction in some instances
in which, at best, it is only possible to arrive at a probable direction of
originating impulse, by drawing a mean major axis through all these closed

curves.
    Constructively, this evil arises not only from the nature of the suspension,

if a pendulum of gravity, or, if one of elasticity, from the form, material,
&c. of the suspending or supporting spring; but also, in both sorts, from the

fact that it is i)ractically impossible that the point of suspension (or, in the
spring, its centre of resistance), the centre of oscillation, and the resultant
of the various opposing forces of the stile or tracing-point, shall lie in one
vertical plane, and that that plane shall always coincide with that of the wave's

movement; and hence lateral divergence of the pendulum and elliptic spiral
oscillation. But it is also partly due to the nature of the earth-wave motion
itself, which is never a purely normal one, but always more or less disturbed
by small transversals; so that the initial movement impressed upon the pen-
dulum is really not exactly that of the wave's transit. Before entering fur-
ther, however, upon the subject of the actual perturbations of the superficial
earth-wave, as now known, and their effects in relation to seismometers, some
remarks may be advisable as to the special objections which I have either

observed or experimentally ascertained in respect to each particular arrange-
ment of the seismometers already described.

--1 («). The Cacciatore mercurial dish. If the earth-wave emerge with a

            considerable angle from the horizon, and large velocity, the mercury
           first sui'ges up at the side of the dish towards which the earth-wave
            is in transit, and in the direction opposite to its motion ; it then,
           after spilling out some of the mercury, commences its return oscil-
           lation, moving in the same direction as the earth-wave, and spills out

          another portion at the opposite side of the dish. The sum of the weights

            so spilled out, taken at either side of a diameter transverse to the
            earth-wave's vertical plane of transit, will vary with every change
            in the angle of emergence, or in the velocity or in the dimensions

             of the earth-wave. Small transversal vibrations, arriving almost
             along with the earth-wave, as well as the efFects of the form of the
             dish, and of its delivering-spouts or adjutages, disturb the initial
            simple surge of the mercury across the diameter of the dish, and pro-

           duce reflected and other secondary surge movements of the mercury,
            which traverse round the circumference of the dish, and spill out
           more mercury in irregular gulps. The final result is, that no reliance
           whatever can be placed upon its final indication, as to the plane of
            the earth-wave transit having passed through the centre of gravity of
            that semicircle of cups which are found to contain the most mercury.
           The result is not materially different if the line of transit of the earth-
           wave be perfectly horizontal. This instrument gives no information
            whatever beyond a most uncertain approximation to the direction
           of the horizontal component of the earth-wave transit.
2(«). The same objections generally apply to this form of instrument, and
            one in addition, viz. that a viscid liquid like molasses must always
            give indications short of the truth as to excursion in the dish due
           to any given shock, and the more so as it is more tenacious and
           approaches nearer to a solid ; and as we have no correct means of
           measuring viscidity, even assuming it constant for the same liquid,
            nor any certainty that the specific gravity of such liquids remains
           constant (it is certain molasses will not remain of the same density
            in any climate for any considerable length of time), so observations
          made through their means at different times and places can never

            be comparable.

3 (a). The same objections that apply to 1 (a) apply to the tub of coloured

            water, but in a mitigated degree, the diameter being large, the
           volume and depth of the liquid great, and the cylindrical sides of the

          tub free from any apertures or inequalities. The initial surge gives
          a much more distinct indication of direction than in either of the

           preceding instruments ; and it does not very frequently happen that

          a diameter may not be found approximating, with tolerable certainty,

           to the plane of earth-wave transit. But in cases where the normal
           wave is preceded or accompanied by very appreciable transversals,

     --those violent tremors that are now known as the frequent ac-

           companiments of the actual shock the water-tub seismometer will
           give no indication, or an uncertain one, unless watched and re-
          marked as to transit-direction at the instant of the occurrence of the

            shock.

4' (a). Tubes partially filled with mercury give almost unobjectionable
            indications as to direction of transit. Their evils are too great

            delicacy or sensitiveness, for the observation of that class ol' earth-

          quakes of mean power, which are the most important to be studied, and
           by which they are completely deranged occasionally, while they are
           continually being disturbed in such a seismic region by small tremulous
         movements that are unimportant to notice. As respects their indi-
           cations of velocity and dimensions of the wave, they are liable to the

            objections already noticed as applicable to all pendula.

5 (b) and G (i). The main disadvantages of these constructions, viz. the
          suspended and the inverted solid pendulum have been already
         pointed out ; it may be added here, however, that with the inverted
          pendulum of Forbes, the supporting spring is more or less crippled
           down, by a sharp vertically (or nearly vertically) emergent shock, which
          gives a lateral movement (greater or less) to the pendulum, as though

            such cases an absolutely false indication.
7(6). Mr. Budge's inverted spring pendulum, restrained to a single semi-
          oscillation in one plane, offers some decisive advantages over any-
          other form hitherto proposed of the pendulum seismometer. Tiie
          whole length of the pendulum is elastic ; and the rod being light,

          the whole weight by whose inertia it is bent may be considered as
         in the ball or bob. If S be the moment of resilience of the rod, and
         the deflection be not very great, the angle wpn=^d, then

                         2(L tan d-b)=--,

L being the length, and b the horizontal ordinate of deflection of the

pendulum. It is plain that although, like every other elastic rod,

this will have a time of vibration of its own, and be therefore liable

to part of the theoretic ol)jections made to the simple pendulum on

the same account, this form of pendulum will be "brought up"

much more nearly within the true limits of the earth-wave amplitude

in its horizontal component.

Perhaps the ratchet and pall may not be the best mode, practically,

of arresting its movement at the end of its first semioscillation, with

sufficient delicacy, and other methods are obvious that may be ap-

plicable                                    but if  the elastic  rod  be  a  flat plate  of sufficient breadth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         in

relation to its thickness, and each rod or pendulum (of the four) be

so placed, with reference to the cardinal points, that its broadest

dimension shall be transverse to its normal plane of flexure, it is then

obvious that practically we may neglect any flexion of the rod edge-

--ways, the four rods in section being posited thus (fig. 5)

                                                                 N.

          and that thus we obtain a flexure, for each pendulum, practically
          limited to its own vertical plane of oscillation, and so can obtain, for

           any intermediate line of wave-transit between the cardinal points a
          good approximate resultant direction from the two adjacent com-
           ponent deflexions. Perhaps a flat ribbon-like rod of tempered steel,
           whose section should be a rectangle, with sides having the proportion
          of about 30 : 1, would be better than an elastic wooden lath ; and in
            either case, it is probable that a tape or silk ribbon, fastened at the
            side ?·, and passing with friction through a small horizontal slot in the
           elastic rod, so as to be stretched by its deflexion and pulled through,

          would be the best and simplest mode of registering the deflexion, or

             the angle 0.

             While this appears to me the best of the solitl-pcudulum arrange-

           ments, I do not wish to be understood as recommending any one of

             the class.

8 {b). Santi's arrangement is of course subject to the objections made to all
          pendula. It possesses some advantage in separation of the results in

           different azimuths, and therein in clearness of indication ; but it also

           has special disadvantages of its own. If, for example, the line of

         earth-wave transit be from S. to N,, and the E. and W. pendulum
         be set up at the S. side of its own wall, it will tend to be thrown

           off or out from the wall by the shock ; if placed on the N. side of

         its own wall, its friction' will be increased on its suspensions,
          and tracing-point, by its being thrown in or pressed against the
         wall ; and if the line of earth-wave transit be, say N.W. and S.E.,

           both pendula will be either thrown out from or pressed in against
           their respective walls, according to which side of the N. and S. walls
           they be fixed at. This source of variable inaccuracy might perhaps
          be eliminated by a double set of pendula, viz. one at each of the

         opposite sides of the N. and S. and of the E. and W. walls, which

           would thus be oppositely affected (in excess and in defect) by this

            source of error.

9 (i). What has been already stated, with reference to errors common to all
          pendula, and the remarks made under 7 (^) as to the superiority of

           elastic over simple pendula, render it needless to enlarge on those
           which were only proposed as extemporaneous instruments, and for
           which they will be found convenient and useful, and not more in-

          accurate than much more elaborate ones.

  --Referring now to the second class, or self-regulating instruments, the

disadvantage of the one

2 (a), proposed by the author is of the same character as that of 4 (a) of the

            first class, viz. too delicate a sensitiveness to small tremulous shocks,

           which derange the composure of the instrument, without its giving
          decisive indications. The galvanic recording part of the apparatus

           was all that could be desired, and is of course applicable to other
            forms of instrument as respects the displacement portions. Indeed,
           apparatus identical in all its main characteristics has been since
           brought into successful and constant use by Professor Airy, Astro-
          nomer Royal, for the registration of astronomical and other kindred

         observations, and also by several experimenters abroad. An account
         of many such arrangements will be found in De la Rive's ' Treatise

on Electricity.'

2 (a). The same remark, I think, may apply to Professor Palmieri's seis-

mometer, with this addition : the movement of the mercury, equal

columns of which are contained in the opposite legs of each U-shaped

tube, depends in his instrument ivholbj upon the U-tube being canted

over more or less in its own plane, so as to throw the legs of the tube

out of plumb. This, Professor Palmieri (if I do not misunderstand him)

considers an inevitable consequence of the transit of the earth-wave

at the instrument, conceiving the earth's surface to suffer, in every

case, such a sensible heaving undulation, as to rock the instrument

upon it, like a ship upon a heavy ground-swell. I must confess to

entertaining great doubts that, in the great majority of earthquakes,

any such sensible undulation (enough, at least, to produce a sensible

throwing out of plumb of the U -tubes) can occur, although I

have no reason to doubt that, from its delicate sensitiveness, con-

tact will be broken, and the instrument act in so far, by some of

the violent jars or jerks that it may receive. This peculiarity con-

stitutes, in fact, the essential difference in arrangement between

the author's seismometer and Prof. Palmieri's. In the former the

            mass of the mercury is in unequal columns in each tube, so that
            its displacement is dependent solely on inertia ; it therefore sympa-
           thizes witli the movement of the earth-wave, emergent in whatever
            way; in the latter, the correctness of indication of the instrument de-
            pends not at all on the inertia of the mercury, but simply upon the

          alteration of relative surface-level in the opposite legs of the U -tubes,
           when the latter are thrown more or less out of plumb by the sup-

             posed undulation of the earth's surface at the transit of the shock,

 S (6). Kreil's ingenious instrument is not devoid of some serious objections.

          It partakes of those common to all pendula ; and these will be further
           perplexed when the annular dish /* ikl is filled with mercury, which
           will form a second (fluid) attached pendulum with a time of oscilla-

           tion of its own, and differing largely from that of the pendulum which
            suspends it. Very little value, however, can be attached to the indi-
           cations to be afforded by the very small amount of mercury that can
            be caused to spill out, owing to the very small arc of oscillation that
           the whole instrument can be afforded to make by construction. The
            most serious objection, however, lies in the method of flexible sus-
            pension adopted for the whole pendulous part of the instrument, viz.,
           by two short thin plates or ribbons of tempered steel, whose respective
             vertical planes are at right angles to each other, the object being to
           allow of oscillalion in any direction, but prevent rotation upon the
           vertical axis. Whenever a somewhat energetic disturbance shall

      --be given to a pendulum so suspended so as to cause oscillation in

            a vertical plane, diagonal to the crossing planes of the two suspend-
            ing ribbons, torsion of each of these arises, and violent twisting
           movements (by jerks) of the pendulum itself result, producing sudden,
           jerking, rotatory oscillations of the bob (the cylinder containing the
            clockwork, &c.) round the axis of the pendulum. These must of
           course interfere with and derange any true results as indicated by
           the tracing-pencil, which must also record all such accidental
           moments, and probably derange the rate of the clock.

               There does not appear, however, to be any insuperable difficulty in
          devising another mode of suspension for the instrument, that might
           at least remove this defect.

    Such are some of the main objections to the seisniometric instruments

themselves, hitherto proposed. It remains to consider the difficulties intro-

duced by the nature of the movements we require to observe and record
with them, as they actually take place in nature. What we want to find
is the true direction of emergence of the normal earth-wave, with its dimen-
sions and velocity, at a given point upon the earth's surface. This, were the
earth a perfectly homogeneous elastic solid, though much easier, would still
be attended with grave difficulties ; one of these, which must ever remain
instrumentally insuperable, consists in the fact that the emergent wave on

leaving the free outlying stratum of the earth's surface, differs both in dimen-
sions and in velocity from the same wave in the previous parts of its deep
transit. Future and more perfect knowledge of the laws of imperfectly elastic

bodies in wave-transmission will, it may be expected, enable us to calculate

the latter from the observed final part of the transit.
    Far, however, from being homogeneous, every portion of our earth's crust

that we are acquainted with consists of various " couches," or masses of
materials, differing in elasticity, density, and degree of discontinuity, in the
character, directions, and openness or closeness of the discontiuuant fissures,
ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OP EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 83

in wetness or dryness, in temperature, and in many other ways. Stratifica-

tion and lamination, witli their transverse master-joints, affect the elasticity

of whole mountain-ranges and j^rofound masses of the land, and cause it to

differ in different directions.

   The mass beneath our feet is very often not even approximately solid.
Vast beds and cavernous recesses occur, empty, or filled more or less with

water, sometimes with lava, ignited rock, and steam at enormous temperature

and tension ; and, for anything we as yet knoio, scismometrj'^ may require to

deal with depths and masses where the solid has passed, with exalted tem-

perature, into the imperfectly liquid state.

   Again, the surface of our earth is everywhere more or less uneven, and,
viewed over large areas, such as earthquake-transit is concerned with, is

ribbed with rigid mountain-chains, often intersecting or abutting on each

other, channeled by valleys, river-courses, deep estuaries, and bays, exca-

vated into basin-shaped hollows often long and narrow, sometimes filled with

unconformable rock or with loose and incoherent detrital material, and inter-
sected to unknown depths by dykes, veins, and faults. The result of these

differences and disturbances of internal structure and superficial features is to

produce perturbations in the surface emergence of the earth wave, often of the

most amazing and perplexing character ; and it is not until the nature and
extent of these have been realized to the mind, that we shall be enabled to
choose the best form of seismometric observation, to determine upon the only
proper sites for the establishment of instruments, and to see within what

limits our first researches must be confined.

Let us notice, then, a few examples of striking surface-perturbation, of

direction, of the great earth-wave, already on record.

   Savi (' Relazione di Fenomeni presentati dai Terremoti di Toscana, dell'
Agosto 1846,' p. 32-44) and Pilla ('Istoria del Tremuoto che ha devastate
paesi della Costa Toscana il di 14 Agosto, 1846,' p. 48-54) have both recorded
examples of horizontal apparent movement of the earth-wave in directions

orthogonal or even actually opposite to each other, and at points within very

limited distances from each other, while, on the whole, there was no doubt
of a ruling general direction of horizontal movement over the whole region.

I can merely refer to their relations, as scarcely admitting of condensation

intelligibly.

   M. Peri-ey, in his ' Memoir on the Earthquakes of France, Belgium, and
Holland' (Mem. Cour. de I'Acad. Roy. de Brux. tom. xviii.), under date of
5th July, 1841, has recorded a still more remarkable instance of surface-
perturbation, which the small map (Plate XII.) of the northern and part of

the central region of France, with outlines of the departmental divisions, illus-

trates. Those departments in which this shockwas felt are marked bynumerals

referring to the following table. The directions of the horizontal component

of the shock, as observed at the several places named, are shown on the map

Aby a short thick arrow.  few other places where the shock was felt, but

direction not observed, are marked by a large dot, and the name referred to

Aby a letter.  ievf large towns, and the general I'ange of the hilly country

(running mainly in a N.W. and S.E. direction) between the two great seats of

disturbance, are marked in mainly as general guides of position to the eye.

This earthquake was sufficiently powerful to disturb furniture, move objects

visibly, and affect clocks, &c., and was variously reported to have lasted in

different places from two or three, to ninety seconds of time.

   ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 85

   The great earthquake of 1819, which extended its influence right across
this peninsula from Calcutta to Cutch, and during which the Uilah Bund was

--elevated, and the Runn of Cutch submerged the former a low mass of sand

and clay seventy miles long, about fifteen miles wide, and elevated about
10 feet; and the latter an area of subsidence of about 2000 square miles
had a great general line of horizontal propagation of shock, as shown by the

heavy red line, of nearly from W. to E., a few degrees to the S.E. yet at
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

Calcutta it was felt from N.E. to S.W., and at many places along this immense

--line situated between the Aravulla and Vindhya chains of mountains, as
--for example at Rampura the great shock was felt in directions quite trans-

verse to the principal line.

    So also the general line of horizontal direction of the great earthquake of
1833, whose origin was far beneath the Himalayas to the E. and N., had a
great general direction about that sliown by the long red arrow line. At
Katmandu, in the mountains, the shocks Avere more directly E. to W., and
also (reflected shocks probably) from the ranges to the N., which had a
direction nearly N.E. to S.W., while in the great plain of the Ganges the
observed directions were various, and, without a more complete knowledge of
the geology and surface-configuration of the country, perfectly unanalysable,

in some places N. to S., and at others, sixty miles oft', from E. to W.
   While we must regard many of these observations as deserving of little

stress as to accuracy, enough remains to prove that perturbations in the
main directions of emergence at the surface of the normal earth-wave, due
to heterogeneity of structure in depth, and to inequality of surface, prin-
cipally, are of such a nature, as to render a special choice of district neces-
sary in attempting any seismometrical researches (even with perfect instru-
ments) which have in view the determination of the position of the focus
of disturbance. This choice, according to our present knowledge, must be
determined by the following conditions :

   1. The whole surface-area of observation, and to as great a depth as
           possible, must be uniform in geological structure.
               If of stratified rock, not greatly shattered and overthrown, but
          (viewed largely) level or rolling only. The harder and more dense
           and elastic the formations, the better, but neither intersected by
           long and great dykes, nor by igneous protrusions of magnitude, nor
           suddenly bounded by such formations.

   2. The surface must not be broken up into deep gorges, and rocky ranges,
           and valleys. Seismometry, in a high and shattered mountainous

           country, can scarcely lead to any result but perplexity. If the surface
           be deeply alluvial all over, it is less objectionable than valley-basins,
           and pans of deep alluvium, with rocky ribs between them.

   3. The size of the area chosen for observation must bear a relation to the

           force of the shocks experienced in it. Moderate shocks are always
            bestfor observation, and, in large areas of the most uniform character
          offormation and surface, will give the most trustioorthy indications.
   4'. If several seismometers be set up in the area, they should be all
           placed on corresponding formations, either all on rock, or all on deep

          alluvium. The rock, when attainable, is always to be preferred.
          Three seismometers, at as many distant stations, will be generally

           found sufficient, if the object be chiefly to seek the focal situation and

             depth.

   Having now cleared the way by stating the difficulties of seismometric

observations, 1st, as respects the instruments themselves, 2nd, as respects
--86 REPORT 1858.

their local emplacement, it remains to describe the instruments that appear

to me the best calculated for the attainment of the objects we can at present
propose to ourselves in seismometry, and to point out how such may best be

applied ; as also some indirect methods of arriving at the most important and
interesting primary result, that Ave are entitled to expect in the first instance
from such researches, namely, an approximation to the actual depth of focus
within the earth, from which earthquake-impulses are propagated to the

surface.

   Were it possible to construct a perfect seismometer, it should record

simultaneously, 1st, the movements, both horizontal and vertical, of the
elastic wave itself, viz., the excursion or amplitude, the altitude, and the

--maximum velocity in the coordinates x, y, and z, z being vertical ; 2nd, the

movements of translation of the "advancing form" or wave itself at its
ernergence upon the earth's surface, with the velocities in the correspond-
ing coordinates x^., y^-, and Zj.

   These involve alone twelve equations of condition ; and we assume that
the elastic medium (the earth) through which the wave is transmitted, is
homogeneous, in density and elastic modulus; and that the final wave-
movements, of the free outlying stratum at the surface, obey the same laws
as do those of the successive " couches " beneath.

   Generally, we must assume the elasticity perfect, and that the vis viva of

any particle in motion, Awi, is determinable from its velocity at its position of

equilibrium. From the general equation of wave-motion

                        =» a cos (^{x-dtyi,

we have the velocity at any point where a- is the intensity, \ the amplitude,
a the transit-rate or velocity of propagation, x the abscissa, and t the time.

   AmAt the position of equilibrium v=^a, and the vis viva of the particle

during the whole undulation is Ama^, and proportionate to a^. The wave
we must suppose emanating from a central point, and propagated outwards
in all directions alike, in imaginary, concentric spherical "couches." The
vis viva must remain constant during the whole propagation. The velo-
city of propagation a is also constant ; and the mass of the medium in wave-
motion at any moment of the translation is the same; so that, if r^the
radius of any such spherical " couche," the work done in it by the wave
is proportionate to x/-^ a^, and constant for the whole transit, a^ being

OC a--. As, therefore, the mass in simultaneous undulation is constant, the

thickness of each imaginary successive " couche " must decrease as r^ ; and
so the displacing power of the wave diminishes also as r% and the work done
by the wave within any such "couche" of determinate thickness=SjAma%

-- or M, being the mass in simultaneous undulation, =^Ma*.

    The wave at its origination, starts in any radius, with one normal and two

transversal vilirations, the separate determination of which would require a
corresponding increase in the number of equations for x, y, and z ; and in the
recorded facts by the instrument. It is obvious, then, even with the utmost

simplifications we can assume as to the molecular condition of the medium
(the earth), that practically we must be content with a seismometer that shall
record only some of the more important conditions of the earth-wave, and in
such a manner as shall enable us, indirectly, to arrive at others. And in
considering the relative importance of the several elements, the maximum
velocity of the wave at its point of emergence upon the surface, with the
ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 8?

directions in .r, y, and z, or the horizontal components {x and y) of the
direction of motion and the vertical component z, will be found the most

valuable.

   These are determinable by one instrument only. By two or more such,

at separate and moderately distant places, the velocity of propagation or

transit-rate a may be found ; and by combining the results obtained by both,
ill calculation, each may be made to check and control the other, and for a

given seismic region (apart from serious perturbations of internal forma-

tion) we can obtain the point upon the surface, vertically above the origin

of the wave, and approximate to the depth of the origin itself, or of the

foQus of disturbance, below the earth's surface.

   One or other, of two distinct seismometric arrangements, may be adopted,

--both dependent upon similar principles, the second being of a simpler and

less expensive cJiaracter, but not susceptible (as a single instrument) of indi-

cations as accurate as the first, yet, as respects applicability to determi-

nations of time (as one of several, set up in a given seismic area), quite as

exact.

   I proceed to describe the construction of both, their principles and action.

   &The first instrument is exhibited in PI. XV. figs. 1, 2 3. Fig. 1 is a

lateral geometric elevation of the instrument, whose length is placed in the

--direction N. and S., as seen in plan in fig. 2, a precisely similar instrument

being placed at right angles of azimuth to it, or with its length E. and W.

The same letters of reference apply to similar parts in all the figures. Fig. 2

represents both the N. and S. and E. and W. instruments as placed in posi-

tion, tow being part of the external wooden shell or wall of the seismic ob-
servatory, which may best be always of wood, or such material, and circular

in form.

%In figs. 1 and  aa is a cast-iron tabular bar, whose upper surface is

horizontal, and whose long parallel edges are either N. and S. or E. and W.

It is attached to a rigid cylindrical vertical bar of wrought iron, b b, which

passes freely, but without shake, through bored holes in the top and bottom

collars of the heavy cast-iron frame c c, which is firmly bolted by its bottom
flanch to the heavy stone floor of the observatory; or, if the latter can be so
placed, to the natural solid rock when levelled to form its floor. Beneath
the frame cc is a pit, pp, for convenience of access to the bottom of the

instrument. Upon the vertical bar b, a collar is fixed of wrought iron, k,

between which and the lower bored collar of the frame cc, a. spiral spring,

c, is placed, having its axis coincident with that of the bar b.

This spring sustains, when at rest, the weight of the bar and table a a, and

of all resting upon it, and is so adjusted as to resistance, that such forces in

the vertical direction, as it may be expected the instrument will be exposed

to at any time, shall not be able to compress the spring to such an extent, as

to bring the lower surface of the table a a, into contact with the top part of

Athe frame cc.  vertical "feather," let into the ha.r b, prevents it, or its

superior attachments, from altering their position with reference to the frame

c c, by turning round the vertical axis of the bar b in its collar-bearings.

  A small sliding index, not shown in the figure, also moves in a longitudinal

groove at the opposite side of the bar b, and, being placed in contact with

the top of the frame c c, when the whole is at rest, indicates the extent of any

vertical depression of the bar b, and of its load, by compression of the spring

Ae. buffer collar of vulcanized india-rubber is placed at /, above the iron

collar k, as a precaution against a jar, in case of the sudden removal of part
of the load on a a by any accident.

   Upon the upper side and centre of the length, of the tabular bar a a, is
--88 REPORT 1858.

cast a hollow quadrilateral prism, g, which will be called " ihehlock" provided

with four " lugs" to receive the pivot-screws n, n, n, n. The table a a, sup-

ports two similar cast-iron inclined jilanes i, i, having for their entire length

the trough-shaped section as shown in fig. S. These planes are fixed to

the table an, by the pivot-screws n,n, and by the adjusting-screws m,m

beneath, so that by means of the latter, the inclination of either plane may

be altered or fixed, being otherwise free to rotate in a vertical plane,

within certain limits, round the pivot-screws n,ii, so as to alter the angles

of inclination.

Upon each of these inclined planes, is placed a large heavy ball, formed of

a hollow sphere of hard gun-metal, of about 0'3 of an inch in thickness,

truly spherical and polished outside, and filled up solid with lead. These

balls are adjusted in diameter, to the breadth and form of the inclined planes

(as in fig. 3), so as freely to roll along, with but two points of contact.

  When the planes i,i are adjusted at equal inclinations, the balls B, Bj rest

at their lowest ends, and are laterally in contact with, and supported by, the
hard wood stops r, r, driven (from outside inwards) through, and well-fitted

--in, corresponding rectangular horizontal " slots" in opposite sides of the

block g, the end of each wood stop being curved to fit the surface of the
balls, in a horizontal great circle, and so that the plane of the stop passes

through the centre of gravity of the ball. Through each wood stop there

--pass the e and e+ extremities of a galvanic conducting-circuit of thick

copper wires, placed at about an inch apart, where they pass parallel to each
other, through the wood stop, with their extreme ends coinciding with the

surface of the stop next the ball, and being amalgamated ; so that while ever
the ball reposes in contact with the wood stop, the galvanic circuit remains

completed., throiigli the ball, between the ends of the wires, but is broken

the moment the ball is removed from contact with them.

   For one complete seismometer there are two such instruments as have

--been thus described, one placed, as in fig. 2, in a N. and S., and the other

in an E. and W. direction, as respects their length, and having thus four

inclined planes and balls, each with its own distinct galvanic circuit from

Aone common battery.  clock placed in the observatory carries round a

cylinder with ruled paper, and each of four pencil markers continues to

describe an unbroken line thereon so long as the balls are in contact with the
blocks (or wood stops and galvanic poles); but (by an arrangement pre-

--cisely similar to that described for my fluid pendulum seismometer Trans.

Hoy. Irish Acad. vol. xxi. p. 107) the moment any ball ceases to be in con-

tact with the block, and for as long as it is so, the pencil is withdrawn, and

leaves a break in the otherwise continuous line traced by the rotation of the

paper. No part of this clockwork registering-arrangement is shown in the

Plate, as several modifications of it are practicable, and no one in parti-

cular is essential to the principle of the seismometer before us.

  --To illustrate the mode of action of the instrument, returning to fig. 1,

suppose it to be the N. and S. one, and adjusted so that the bar h is truly

vertical, the parallel sides of the inclined planes i and i truly in directum,

Qtheir angles of inclination to the horizon the same. Then if the arrow

represent the direction of emergence of an earthquake-wave (supposed here
to be in the plane of the meridian, and from S. to N.), at the first instant
that the wave reaches the instrument, the bar i, and table a a, with all they
carry, will commence to descend and to compress the spring e by their inertia,
with a velocity dependent upon the vertical component of the wave, which
carries up the frame c c vertically. Also at the first instant of arrival of

She wave, the ball Bo, in virtue of its inertia, will move off from the block
ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 89

towards Cj ; and the instant of its departure, bij breaking galvanic contact of
the poles at its stop, marlts that of the cowmeiicemeiit of the shock. But tlie
whole instrument is carried forward by the horizontal component of the

shock, and then moves back again ; the Bball is therefore carried forward

also, urged bj' the block at r, and is caused to roll up along the inclined

plane a certain distance, saj' to (J, where it conies to rest, and, reversing its

motion, rolls back again by gravity, and returns to rest in contact with the

block and galvanic poles of its own stop. The ball which first moves, which
M'e may call the Time Ball (as indicated in time by the pencil trace on

the clock-cylinder paper), will alivays be that at the side from which the

Weshock arrives.  neglect any account of its subsequent motions. The

other ball, which we may call the Element Ball, by its movements gives

us the elements of the wave. The instrument records the lohole time that it

is out of contact with the block g, viz. that of its excursion up and down
the inclined plane i. If, in place of the wave having emerged at some angle

to the horizon from S. to N., it had come at the same or at any other angle

of emergence between vertical and horizontal, in the reverse direction or

from N. to S., then the action of the balls also would have been reversed,

B becoming the Time Ball, and being left behind, and thus noting the mo-

ment of arrival of the wave; and B^ being thrown up along the inclined

plane i, giving its elements.

   Again (referring to fig. 2), if the wave emerge at some azimuth between
N. and S. and E.and W., suppose from the S.W., with any angle of emergence,

then by the vertical component the springs of both the N.S. and E.W. instru-

ments will be compressed (and nearly alike). The time balls B^ of the N.S. and

B., of the E.W. instruments will be left behind, as before, (and both at the

same instant will break contact with the block); and the element balls B and

--B will be thrown forward upon their respective inclined planes, as before to

equal distances in the case of the exactly intermediate azimuth here supposed,

but to unequal distances if this azimuth be more to the W. or to the S.
The instrument records the simultaneous excursions of both balls B and B,

giving the total time (as before) that each ball is out of contact with its own

block or stop ; and if the direction of the wave-movement be reversed as re-

spects the instrument (suppose, from some point of N.E. towards S.W.), then

therespectivemovementsandfunctions of the balls willalsoreverse themselves,

B and B being left behind, and Bj and Bj thrown forward, &c.

The general size and strength of the instrument must be determined with

reference to the degree of violence of the earthquake-shocks to be anticipated

in the seismic region it is intended for. The very greatest, and the very

smallest perceptible shocks, are alike unsuited for useful measurement. The

dimensions of the instrument, as shown by the scale of the plate, are such as

I consider fitted to ensure its functions, under the effects of those shocks of

mean intensity (sucli for example, as those common in the Mediterranean

basin, or in those of Hungary and Austria), and with moderate vertical angles

of emergence, which are those best to observe in the existing state of our

knowledge.

 --The most important points of precaution of a constructional character to

be noticed are the following: The balls should be of lead chiefly (the sur-

face being formed, for hardness and smoothness, of gun-metal), to reduce

their proper elasticity as much as possible. The inclination of the planes i, i

must be small, probably never exceeding 15°, and the length and inclination

so adjusted by experiment, to the maximum time of wave-oscillation in the

district of observation, that the whole time of rolling up and down of the ball

shall be considerably longer in duration. Their bearing-edges must be per-
--90 REPORT 1858.

fectly parallel and smooth ; and the length of the planes must be such, as to

make it highly improbable that any ball, in its excursion under shock, can

Areach the upper end.      wood stop is fixed at this point to arrest the ball,

should it ever chance to reach it; and beyond this a stout net (like the purse of

a billiard-table) may be fixed to a separate support (from the floor), to receive

the ball, if upon an extraordinary occasion thrown out of the instrument.

It is assumed that any alternate alteration of the inclination, of the inclined

planes i, i, by actual surface-rmdulation, carrying the whole instrument with

it at the passage of the earth-wave, may be neglected, i.e. that, for example,
a wave passing in a direction from S. to N. will not sensibly lift up the S. end

(of the N. S. instrument) first, and then the N.end, and so first increase the

inclination of the  plane  of  Bg  and reduce  that  of B, and  then  vice versd
                                                                                                                   ;

and that whatever amount of tilling may thus occur will so momentarily

affect the inclined planes, and in opposite directions, as not to interfere

with the proposed movements of the balls.

This assumption is justified by the fact that the value of X, the amplitude

of the earth-wave in the normal, is always great in relation to its altitude,

and in the case of oblique surface-emergence its horizontal component is of

still greater length ; so that the angle of slope of either face of the emergent

wave with the horizon, is practically imperceptible in moderate shocks; and,

further, any tilting that can occur takes place in opposite directions suc-

cessively, so as nearly to compensate.

The vertical spring e must be delicate and sensitive, at the first instant of

its compression, in proportion to the movement by inertia of the large mass

that it carries, and its range, proportioned to the degree of steepness of

emergence to be expected in the region of observation.

   The whole vertical component is absorbed by this spring, and may be mea-

sured by its compression ; but it is important that it shall give way sensitively,

at the first moment of shock, in order that neither of the balls shall have any

tendency to rise from the inclined planes that support them, and that its resili-

ence shall not be too lively, so as not to produce rebound upon the restoration

from compression. In certain seismic regions, where great steepness of

emergence may be looked for, the vertical component will probably be best

met by the depression of a conical float with the apex downward, fixed to

the lower end of the bar bb, into a cylindrical vessel of water placed beneath

the instrument ; but this must be matter of experiment in such regions.

Were the whole instrument rigidly fixed to the ground, the latter as well

as the materials of the instrument and ball highly elastic, and the velocity

of emergence of the wave, in its vertical component, very great, it is obvious

that time would not be aff"orded to the ball B, merely to roll up along the

plane ; it would be thrown up obliquely from it, and, describing a short trajec-

tory, would fall back again upon the plane a little higher up, and then re-

peat a still shorter trajectory, or begin to roll upwards. But the ball is very

inelastic, the rate of emergence of the wave is not very great in its vertical

Unless, possibly, in the case of nearly vertical emergence, and from the most
solid, and elastic crystalline rock, an ample latitude, t, is secured by the ver-

tical spring.

  We will now consider the movements of the element balls B and Bj along

the planes i, i, due to the horizontal component of motion, taking the two in-

struments (viz. the N. S. and E. W. seismometers) together, and assuming the

horizontal component in any azimuth d.

The  blocks g r (N. S.)  and    r (E. W.)                               move        forward  horizontally,  and

                              ff

force on the balls B and B, before them until the instant, -, when the blocks

have acquired their maximum velocities, with that of the wave,v; the balls then

part company from tlie blocks, and continue to move up along the respective

inclined planes i, i, sliding for the first indefinitely short moment, and then,

with a certain reduction of velocity due to the friction of the planes which

produce the change of motion, rolling up along them. This initial sliding

velocity will be

                   For the ball B . , . V=tJ sin Q

                   Y=vFor the ball Bi . . .                             cos fl.

As soon as the sliding is converted into rolling motion by friction, these
velocities will become

                         --5 V sin 0, and 5- v cos 9.

                         77

Assuming that the change takes place almost instantly after the balls have
begun to move from the blocks, i.e. that gravity has not had time perceptibly
to alter the velocity up the plane, and neglecting the small effects, due to the
elastic compression of the balls and blocks themselves, and also supposing
that the loss of velocity of the ball, by conversion of its sliding into rolling
motion by friction, is less than the diminution of velocity of the block (in the

same short time), in returning from its maximum velocity to rest, the balls
B and B, will be retarded by forces

                         For B                                          7-^a siai,

                         For B                                          ~g cos i,

i being the common inclination of the planes.
   The ball B will therefore ascend upon its plane to a vertical height

This calculation assumes that the sliding is converted into rolling motion in
an indefinitely siiort time, as it would in fact be, if the adhesion of the balls
were large, and the inclination of the planes i small ; but if the inclination
of the latter be considerable, as 13° or upwards, a more exact determination

is necessary.

   Let, as before, the horizontal components of the velocity with which the

balls begin to move, be ii sin 6, and v cos 6, Z the velocity in the vertical,
and the inclination of the planes i now large.

experimentally from the compression of the vertical spring ; or, as sug-

gested by my friend Dr. Harte, to whom I have been indebted for these

equations, a second pair of experimental inclined planes and balls might be

used, with an inclination greater than i (say 2«), from the observed movements
upon which, two more equations could be got, the four equations being then

more than enough, to determine v, Z and 0.

terms of the whole time that the balls B and B are out of contact with the

--block gr, i. e. of their rolling up, and down, the inclined planes, this time

being given, by the lacune in the pencil-trace made upon the revolving cy-
linder of paper carried along by the clock. The time of the balls' ascending

to the highest point reached on the plane will be independent of adhesion

   Reverting now to the time balls B^, B-, those which, being leflbehind, record

the instant of the arrival of the shock at the instrument,--it has been stated
that we have no occasion to determine their subsequent movements ; it

may be well, however, to clear our notions generally as to what these will
be. Rotation is almost instantly communicated to these balls by adhesion
with the moving planes on which they rest. The block moves off horizon-

tally (in the direction of the wave) from the ball, which rolls thus with a

retarded motion up the inclined plane in a relatively opposite direction. The
block attains its maximum velocity V, and, coming to rest, reverses the direc-
tion of its own motion, and now follows back after the ball that it had left
behind, which it may overtake, and strike, with a relative velocity equal to
the sum of its own velocity and that of the ball, or to their difference, depend-
ent upon the state of motion of the ball at the moment of impact. The

impact calling forth elastic force from ball and block, the former will be
thrown up along the inclined plane ; but the extent of this movement, or
whether it occur at all, will depend upon the dimensions and velocity of the
wave itself (resolved into the line of movement on the inclined plane) and
upon the elasticity, &c. of the ball and block. These we have no occasion
to pursue further: the actual movements of these balls, B^ and B^, how-

ever, will be found recorded in time also, by their own pencil-tracers on the

cylinder ; but the only indication that concerns us, is the first instant of
broken contact, as already explained.

  A single seismometric observatory, such as has been now described, set up

within a given region of disturbance, is capable of giving the elements, neces-
sary for the calculation of the position of the seismic focus, but without the

power of controlling the accuracy of the results, except in so far as coinci-

dent repetitions may confirm or refute them. But if three such seismome-

tric observatories be set up within the region chosen, in positions that shall
form the angles of a triangle with respect to each other, at moderate distances
apart (from 15 to 30 miles), and these be all connected by galvanic wires,
so that the whole of their records shall be made upon a single paper cylinder,
moved by a single clock in one of the three observatories, we then have a
further control, and an independent method of obtaining, both the hori-
zontal component of direction, and the surface-velocity, from which, by

methods yet to be stated, the depth of origin may be calculated without
direct ascertainment of the vertical component in Z. The cylinder must in

this case carry twelve pencil-tracers, four leading from each observatory.
    This leads us to the second and somewhat simpler form of seismometer

 proposed by me, and shown in figs. 4, .5, 6 and 7 (of Plate XV.). In some re-
 spects, the principles of this instrument are the same as of that just described :
 like the former, it is a double instrument, each instrument having two move-

 able balls; but their action is different. Fig. 4 represents, in elevation, one

 of these instruments (let us suppose, that N. S.) as seen looking eastward,
 and the upper part of which is seen in plan in fig. 5. ss is the floor of the
 observatory within which the two similar instruments are placed, tt is a.
 shallow and flat-bottomed dish or basin of some feet in diameter, and about
 nine inches in depth, formed by a circular wooden curb or rim secured to

 the floor.

     In the centre of this, there stands up vertically a very stiff pillar or upright,

 rigidly secured into the floor, and which may be either of hard stone, hollow

 cast iron, or of hard wood, but best of the second. Its upper end is formed
 of wrought or cast iron in the form shown ; and into it are secured the vertical
 supports of hardwood, s,s, which are placed with their parallel and vertical

 axes in the plane of the meridian or at right angles thereto, and are prepared,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            .;

so as to support the balls B and B. upon their upper ends, which are sliyhlhj

hollowed to the same curve as the'surface of the balls, as seen at full size in
fig. 7. The balls, when in this position, rest against and are steadied by the
hollow stop over the axis of the vertical pillar, b in figs. 4, 5, and 6.

   The balls may be common cast-iron cannon shot, chosen of good sphe-

rical form and of equal weight ; and each ball is in metallic connexion at one

--point of its surface with a galvanic-circuit wire, of which it forms one pole,

marked et, the supports s, s, and the stop b, being all of hard wood or other
insulating material, as pottery or glass. The height of the central column
should be such, that the centre of gravity of each of the two balls, when on

their supports, may be some submultiple of 32 h>=g (say 8 feet =-^)> for

facility of calculation.

   The shallow basin tt\s subdivided in two semi-circular separate areas, by
a wood division, d, equal in depth to the outer rim, this division crossing in

--the diameter which lies at right angles to the plane of the supports s, s, i. e.

being east and west for the north and south balls, and z'zce versa in the other
instrument. Each segment of the shallow basin is lined within its outer rim
and bottom with sheet-lead, which is at one point of each in metallic con-

--tact with the other pole of the galvanic circuit marked Eo

   The two segments of the dish are filled up to the level of the surround-
ing rim, with a bed of damp sand, pressed uniformly and " struck off"' level
to the rim by a straight edge, so as thus to present a uniform bed 9 inches
deep, the balls B, B., being 6 inches in diameter and 8 feet above it. While
the instruments (i. e. that N.S. and E.W.) are thus prepared, the galvanic
circuit remains constantly broken, the poles formed by the balls being in-
sulated from the other poles formed by the sand-beds, the lead lining, &c.
Suppose now, in fig. 4<, an earthquake-wave to emerge from S. to N. in the

direction of the arrow ; the ball Bo is left behind as in the former instrument,
topples off' its slender support s, and commences to fall to the surface of the

sand. The moment it strikes the sand, it makes contact with its own circuit,

and as the time of its fall can be exactly calculated and is constant (neglect-
ing the small resistance of the air), this ball (as before) marks the precise mo-

ment of the arrival of the shock at the instrument. The other ball B is

urged forward by the movement of the whole instrument in the direction of
the arrow, or that of thcM'ave's emergence, being supported bys and b, until

the instrument acquires its maximum velocity v as before. This ball is then

thrown off from its support with this velocity, and, describing a small trajec-

tory in air, falls to the bed of sand, and in its turn makes contact with its own
galvanic circuit. The ball partially buries itself in the damp sand at the

spot it falls upon, without change of position from any elastic effort, all such
being absorbed by the " deadness " of the sand. If the shock has been in
the plane of the meridian, the place where it shall land on the sand-bed will
also be in that plane, say at B'.

    Then the horizontal distance from the centre of its support s to the centre
of the ball, measures the horizontal component of the velocity, this space
being described by it during the time of its descent through eight feet. The
difference in time (as shown upon the ruled paper by the pencil-tracers and
clockwork as before) between the instant of B^ and of B leaving their sup-

=ports, is almost exactly -, or half the time of the wave.

   The same explanations will apply to the other, or E. and W. instrument

and if the azimuth of emergence 6 be somewhere between N. S. and E.W.,
all four balls will be displaced, and the obliquity of throw of each of the balls
ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 95

B (N. and S.) and B (E. and W.) from their respective cardinal and ver-

tical planes, will indicate the actual azimuth of the horizontal component of
the earthquake wave giving this indication in two ways, each controlling

-- --the other, viz. by direction of throw as stated, and by distance of horizontal

traject, which will be proportionate to sine and cosine 0.

The stop b, it should be remarked, is hollowed at contact with each ball,
=so as to embrace 90° of its horizontal great circle; so that in case
                                                                       45°

from the meridional or the E. and W. planes, the balls cannot slip aside, but

must be thrown in the same direction, the extreme angles of the stop then

passing through the plane of motion and centre of gravity of the balls.

   Figs. 5 and 6 show in plan the relative positions of the N. S. and E.W.

instruments, the upper portions alone being represented, and not at the ne-

cessary distance apart.

These instruments singly, then, give us the velocity of the wave and its

direction in azimuth with considerable accuracy ; but their full value would
only be ensured by placing three such seismometers within a given district

(as already staled for the former instrument) and connecting them all by

galvanic wires, so that the indications of the three shall be recorded by a

Wesingle clock register.  then have the time of arrival of the shock at each

seismometer given with perfect accuracy, from which both its horizontal

velocity and azimuth may be computed ; and the relative positions and

distances apart of the several seismometers being known, the true direction

of emergence of the wave, and the point of the surface vertically over the

origin, and the depth of the focus itself may be computed. The two following

methods of computing these are due to Professor Haughton, of Trinity

College, Dublin, who communicated them to the Geological Section of the

British Association at Dublin, on the occasion of this report being read, and

from whom I have received them for publication here.

  --The determination of the " coseismal line" a term first used by me at the

suggestion of Sir John Herschel, to signify, the crest of the simultaneously

--emergent earth-wave upon the earth's surface at any moment of its progress
   is the same thing as determining the direction of its motion on the surface,

a horizontal tangent to the coseismal line at any point being always ortho-

gonal to the dire9tion of motion.

Corol. 2. Independently of any diminution in the absolute velocity of the

       earth-wave, the apparent horizontal velocity will diminish rapidly,

       approaching indefinitely the limit V. This is evident from the

       PXgeometrical considerations arising from the fact that       is

       always equal to QY.

   It is obvious, then, that by the establishment of these very simple and in-
expensive seismometers, and connecting them galvanicaily (as respects their

registration) by methods now become both familiar and simple, we may get

good first approximations to one of the most important questions of the
physics of our globe-- a knowledge of the depth from which earthquake

impulses arrive.

   Simple and inexpensive, however, as the apparatus recommended is, its
establishment in the only way in which it can be of much real use, namely

by connected distant stations, involves the choice of seismic areas fitted for

the purpose, and the support and aid of governments, if not for outfit, at
least for appointment of observers, and police protection of stations and wires.

It is to be hoped that even these may not be withheld as the advancing know-

ledge of the importance to physical geology of seismic research becomes better
understood and diffused. Meanwhile a still simpler form of rough seismo-

--meter, suited to the resources of distant and isolated observers, may be with

advantage, perhaps, pointed out, and also an indirect method, by which the

depth of eartliquake origin may be approximated, without the use of seismo-
meters of any sort. The form of seismometer about to be described is most

applicable to seismic districts where the angle of wave-emergence is not
steep, i. e. where the shocks are usually nearly horizontal.

   If any homogeneous, parallelepiped, or rectangular prism, standing on
end, upon a level surface, be upset by its own inertia, the supporting sur-
face being suddenly moved beneath it, in the direction of its own plane (as

by the horizontal component of an earthquake shock), it may be shown

that the velocity of the surface must be

                  _- 4. /   -- /I -- cos0\

                  3 V cos'0. /

where a is the altitude of the solid, h its diameter of base, and 6 the angle
formed by the side and a line drawn through the centre of gravity to the
extremity of the base, and \^=2ffk.

    This velocity is independent of the density or material of the solid,

because the oversetting force, being its own inertia, is always proportionate
to the density. With a given velocity V, therefore, it is possible to as-
sign the dimensions a and b such, that it shall be just overset; and with

--this velocity another solid, having d greater, shall remain unmoved, as-

suming always that friction upon the supporting surface gives suflScient

adhesion to cause the solid to upset, and not to slide (partly or wholly)
without upsetting.

    If in place of a square prism like a wall, the solid be a right cylinder, such
as a pillar, the diameter of whose base, as before, is b ; then

and from this very simple expression for tlie horizontal velocity, for which I

am indebted to my friend Professor Haughton, it is easy to construct a seis-

mometer of the greatest simplicity, tiiat (in the absence of better means)

   Let there be constructed two similar sets of right cylinders, say each set,
six to twelve in number, all of equal height (a) and of the same sort of
material, but varying in diameter in each set, with a uniform decrement

from the greatest to the least.
    Convenient dimensions for earthquake observations of mea7i intensity, will

be such, that the cylinder of largest diameter shall have its altitude equal to

three diameters, or b=-, and that the cylinder of least diameter shall have

                                        3

its diameter one-third of that of the greatest one, or &=|. Any number of

cylinders  of intermediate  diameters  may be  interpolated  between and the
                                                                                                  ;

Agreater the number, the more accurate the instrument becomes.       series of

six to ten in each set will, however, be sufficient for any purpose. For

observation of shocks of extreme violence, larger diameters, in proportion to

altitude, should be chosen for all the cylinders.

   The material of the cylinders is not important, cast iron, stone, pottery, or
other substances at hand, whose arrises will not crumble away by being
overthrown, may be used ; but no material will be found more convenient

than some hard heavy wood, of uniform substance, straight grain, and equa-

ble specific gravity, from which the cylinders can be formed in the lathe,

and their bases brought perfectly square to the axis with facility.

Upon any horizontal and solid floor let two planks be placed, as in fig. 6,

with their directions in length respectively lying N. and S. and E. and \V.,

                            Fig. 6.

each plank to be about 3 inches in thickness, and in width equal to the dia-
meter of the largest cylinder, and its length such that the set of cylinders,

when placed upright and equidistant thereon, shall have a space greater than

the altitude between each. Thus, if the cylinder of largest diameter have
ft=0'5 of a foot, the length of plank will, for a set of six, as in the figure,
be about 12 feet. These base-planks heing Jixed, level, and solid, the floor is
to be levelled up to their upper surfaces with dry sand, and the two sets of
        --;

cylinders adjusted to their places, one set running in an east and west, and the

other in a north and south direction, so that in whatever direction the hori-

zontal component of shock may move, the overthrown cylinders, of one or the

other set, shall fall transversely to the lengths of either of the plank bases, and,

lodging on the sand-bed, remain exactly in the position as to azimuth in which

they loere overthrown. If now a shock of any horizontal velocity capable of

overthrowing some of the cylinders, but not all of them, arrive, it will throw

down at once all the narrower ones, and up to a certain diameter of base.

For example, suppose a N. and S. shock, of such velocity as to overthrow
W W W W W V6, 5, and VV -t, leaving
           3, 2, and                1 standing ; then will
Whave been greater than the velocity due to the overthrow of 4, and less
Wthan that due to the overthrow of
                                    3, and, within those limits, may be
Wfound from the preceding equation. The cylinders here overthrown,
W W5, and                                                           6,

           4, will be found with their axes lying N. and S., at rest upon

N N Nthe sand-bed. The cylinders 6, 5, and 4, will be also overthrown

but in this case they will fall in the line of their own plank bases, and may

roll and so give no indication as to direction of shock in azimuth. Hence the

necessity for two sets of cylinders; one set, however, will be sufficient, if

space enough be provided between the cylinders, and if each be placed

upon a cylindrical and separate basis of a diameter equal to its own, and in

height equal to the depth of the sand-bed.
   This form of instrument, then, is capable of giving approximate deter-

minations of

   1st. The velocity of the horizontal component of shock, neglecting the
vertical component, which may be done where the angle of emergence is not

great.

2nd. The azimuthal direction of the horizontal element of shock.

3rd. Its absolute direction of primary movement, viz. the direction of

translation of the wave, which always coincides with the direction of mole-

cular movement of the elastic wave itself, in the first half of its complete

phase: e. g., if the wave show a N. S. azimuth, by the line of direction of axes
of the overthrown cylinders, and these be thrown to the northward, then the

wave has traversed from S. to N.
   4th. The exact time of the transit of shock may be also indicated if the

N Wnarrowest cylinders, 6 and 6 be connected with a clock, so as to stop

it at the moment of overthrow by the very simple means which I have
pointed out in the 'Admiralty Manual' (art. " Earthquake," sec. vii., p. 208,
2nd edit.), inasmuch as, by hypothesis, the narrowest cylinders will be always

overthrown.

  A single cylinder or prism, however entirely distinct from either seismo-

metrical set, and of even less stability as respects shock, may be Avith

advantage adopted as the means for stopping the clock by the above method,

which is capable of giving the time to within O'l of a second.
   It is obvious that the application of the principles involved in this form

of seismometer to observations made upon the recent overthrow of walls,
columns, or other such objects to be found in regions which may have been
visited by earthquakes, is capable of giving also approximate measures of

velocity and direction of shock. This class of seismic observation will, I

hope, be found more fully developed elsewhei-e.
· In conclusion, one other method of indirect seismometry remains to be

explained, which does not require the aid of any seismometric instrument.
The facts upon which this method depends have been alluded to in the Re-

port on Earthquakes of 1850, p. 35. It has been long observed that, in
extensive surfaces of country that have been exposed to the effects of shock,

                                                                    h2
--100 REPORT 185S.

 certain zones or areas of surface, more or less irregular, present themselves,
 within which the destructive effects upon buildings and other objects capable
 of overthrow are manifested much more intensely, than upon similar objects
 situated upon other portions of the superficies of the country. These zones

 of maximum disturbance (as yet ill observed) have been remarked to run in

 curvilinear directions of surface, to approach more or less, according to the
 means of (t. e. the objects afforded for) observation, to closed curves, and to
 be wholly distinct from tliose variations of destructive agency, irregularly
 parseme over large shaken areas, which depend upon differences of geologic

 surface-formation, configuration of country, &c., construction of buildings,

 and many other conditions, which modify the direction and effects of the
 shock at points often very little removed from each other, and the analysis
 of which, and extrication of the true primary movement from the entangle-
 ment of such minor phenomena, constitute the greatest difficulty of earth-
 quake observation. The physical conditions which give rise to such zones
 of maximum disturbance are easily explained.

   Referring to fig. 7, let h! h be the horizon (which we may assume a

right line) cut by a vertical plane passing through a great circle of the earth,

and through A, the centre of impulse of the earthquake. The blow from

this origin is propagated outwards in all directions, through the elastic mass
of the earth (here assumed iiomogeneous), in spherical concentric shells,

which the circles 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. denote, at similar phases of the wave. The
elastic wave starts from the impulse with one normal and two transversal
vibrations. Its vis viva must remain constant, and (in the same medium its
dimensions being very great) tlie velocity of translation also. The mass in
wave-movement, at any moment of its transit, is therefore the same, and the

thickness of each successive spherical shell decreases from the centre of im-
pulse as the square of its mean distance. This is the measure of the normal
excursion of anyparticle, from any given phase of the wave,in its passage out-
wards, to the recurrence of the same phase, and is also the measure of the nor-

mal intensity of the shock, or that in directions AB, AC, AZ, &c. Neglect-

ing for the present the effects of the transversal wave, the normal intensity or
direct overthrowing power of an earthquake shock varies inversely as the
square of the distance from origin. But the surface capability of the shocfe
ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 101

to overthrow buildings, &c. depends not only upon its intensity, but upon

Athe direction of its movement with respect to the horizon.  shock per-

fectly vertical has no tendency to overturn the walls of a house, though it

may bring down the roof or floors. Now it is obvious from the figure,

that as the wave passes outwards from the origin, A, it reaches the earth's

surface vertically at B, the point in the prime vertical, ja A, directly over

the same; and that as it travels outwards, it emerges at the surface with

angles more and more nearly horizontal; the angle of emergence being the

same at all points of any coseismal line, all such lines being, on the as-

sumption of homogeneity, concentric circles round B (like those upon a

pond into which a stone has been thrown).

So far as the direction of wave-motion is concerned, therefore, its power to

overturn buildings is greater the further it has travelled, or the greater the

radius of the coseismal circle from B ; but \ts energy has been shown to be

inversely as the square of the distance (not upon the earth's surface, but in

the normal). Hence it follows that there must be some given distance upon

the surface around B at which the combined effect, of most advantageous

direction and lessened energy, shall produce the most destructive effects

upon buildings, &c., or a point, C, intermediate to B and Z, or Z' supposed at

any indefinite distance, at which the shock will be, in tliis respect, a maximum.

BCThe radius  will then describe a coseismal circle upon the earth's sur-

face, which will be a zone of maximum disturbance.

   Conversely, if we can trace by observation of the shaken country such a
zone, or ascertain three points in its circle, we can find the centre of the

circle or the point B, which is plumb over the centre of impulse beneath
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

andif we have ascertained the angle of emergence that produces the maximum

effect (and which is a constant), wd'can then calculate the depth of the centre

of impulse, A, beneath the earth's surface.

AReferring to fig. 8, let  be, as before, the centre of impulse ; B the

point upon the earth's surface (supposed a plane), in the prime vertical joA,

varies inversely as the square of the distance, shall be a maximum.

CACThe angle      is therefore very nearly 70" 31' 43", which is the angle

of tiic cone wliose base in tiie horizontal plane limits the zone of maximum

                                   1 : \/2 : Vs.

Hence we arrive at the very simple practical rule.

Having found the coseismal zone of maximum disturbance by observation,

or three points in it, and the centre of the circle passing through them, the

depth below the surface, of the origin or centre of impulse, will be the dia-

gonal of the square whose side is equal to the radius of the given circle.

Within certain approximate limits, then, the application of this rule is

capable of giving some information upon that great object of research, to

which, above all others, seismological investigation points, namely, the depth

beneath our surface from which such impulses reach us, and, by consequence,

that at which active volcanic forces are in operation within our planet.

This method can scarcely be applied in very mountainous regions, unless

both mountain- formations and seismic energy be developed upon a grand

scale, as in Mexico and South.\merica ; and in every case the observer will
find himself encumbered and perplexed by the interference of many minor

circumstances of disturbance to mask and render difficult his observations.

These, however, should not prevent our bearing the method in mind when-

ever favourable conditions present themselves for its use.

In the present state oC the theory of wave-movements in elastic solids, it

cannot be said to be experimentally certain, that the energy of the wave, in

the normal, does diminish with the square of the distance. Another view of

the primary conditions of its motion would make it diminish directly as the

CACdistance, in which case it may be proved that the angle      of the

coseismal cone of maximum disturbance will be 90° and constant, and hence
ox THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHaUAKE PHENOMENA. 103

that the depth of the origin (upon that hypothesis) will be always equal to

the radius of the circle of maximum disturbance. It would be out of ])lacc

here to enter further into the physical discussion of this question, exce{)t by

referring to Herschel (art. "Light," ' Encyc. Metrop.' vol. iv. paragr. 18.

p. 578) and to the various papers of Cauchy, Wertheim, Stokes, Airy,
Haughton, and Maxwell on the subject.

I have stated that in the preceding investigation the effects of the transver-

sal wave are neglected. In the observation of actual earthquake phenomena,
this may probably be safely done as respects all points that are at consider-

able distances from the centre of disturbance. The normal and transversal

waves, starting at the same instant, appear to travel with unequal velocities.

They part company ; and their distance becomes greater^ and the interval
larger between their arrivals, the further they have both travelled. Were

we enabled, therefore, to ascertain the precise velocity of the normal wave,

and the exact interval of time between the arrival at a distant point of the

normal and transversal waves, we could still by another method arrive at the

distance from which they had come, and therefore at the depth of the origin

oi" impulse, if the angle of emergence at one point were known. According

to Cauchy, the velocity of transit of the normal is to that of the transversal

wave as \/3 : 1 in media of unlimited mass; and Wertheim's modified for-

Mymulae for elastic bodies fix it as 2 : 1.  own experimental observations

with the seismoscope have proved to me that the separation of the two waves

can be noticed, and the interval of time measured upon even very moderate

ranges of wave-transit, not exceeding a few miles ; and the observations of

earthquake shocks indicate that 07ie cause of the tremors that usually succeed

the main blow, is the later arrival of the normal wave, whose amplitude .at

considerable distances from the origin is always small.

However this may be, it is certain that in all earthquakes the real mis-

chief and overthrow, at places pretty far removed from above the centre of

impulse, are done by the blow from the normal wave, which appears to
come first ; hence the main observable eflTects are those of the normal, and

we 'are justified and enabled, in such localities, to neglect the transversal.

But within a considerable circle of area, whose boundary is evanescent, and

whose centre lies at the point B (figs. 7, 8), right above the origin, the

actual effects of the transversal wave are very formidable, and can never be

neglected.

   The ground beneath an object so situated, such as a house or pillar (as
the distance from the origin to the surface is the minimum range of emer-

gence, or shortest possible, and therefore its energy the greatest), is almost

at the same instant thrown nearly vertically upwards by the normal wave,
and at the same moment rapidly forced forwards and backwards horizontally

in two directions orthogonal to each other ; and this combined movement,

which is that called "vorticoso" by the Italians and Spanish Mexicans, is
one that nothing, however solid and substantial in masonry, &., can long

withstand.

   Hence it follows that, within the zone of maximum disturbance which we
have treated of, and occupying its central region, we shall always find an

area, more or less circular, also of great overthrow and destruction, though

presenting entirely different characteristics as to the manner of overthrow of
the buildings, &c. This middle region may therefore be sought for as a

further directrix to the point B over the centre of impulse. It may be

necessary to remark that this combined movement, due to the two transver-

sal waves, and limited to a region closely above the prime vertical passing

through the centre of impulse, must not be confounded by any misconcep-
                      -- .1

tion of the phrase " vorticoso," with that false notion of vorticose shock,
such as was presumed to have twisted the Calabrian obelisks, &c., the real
nature of whose displacement I indicated in 184^6. (Trans. Roy. I. Acad,
vol. xxi. part 1. See also 1st Report Trans. Brit. Assoc. 1850, pp. 33, 34.)

   In conclusion, I would repeat my conviction that a further expenditure

of labour in earthquake catalogues of the character hitherto compiled, and

alone possible from the data to have been compiled, is now a waste of scien-
tific time and labour. The main work presented for seismologists in the

immediate future, must consist in good observations, with seismometers ad-
vantageously placed at sufficiently distant stations, and galvanically connected
as to time ; and in the careful observation of the traces left by great shocks
 (when of recent occurrence) upon buildings and other objects artificial and
natural, witii a view to determining the nature of the forces that have affected
them, aided by the resources of the physicist and mathematician.

    Amongst the unknown regions of our world, as respects the recurrence of
earthquakes and their phenomena, the most prominent are Central Africa,
Abyssinia, Madagascar, Northern Asia, and the north-west of North Ame-
 rica. For observations of the last, the new settlements about being formed
at Vancouver's Island will, no doubt, offer great facilities, as well as future
 access to the great Aleutian chain of volcanoes and their seismic zone.

    I reserve for the Appendix a few observations, upon great sea waves and
 certain ill-understood phenomena, which could not systematically find place

 in this Report.

                              The New Zealand Earthquake.

                                                                                                                                                                 " Wellington, 23rd January, 1855.

" Wliilst sitting reading and talking at 8.50 p.m., I felt the house (which had been shaking

with the occasional N.E. gusts so usual at Wellington) give a very extraordinary shake,

which seemed to continue, and was accompanied by a fearful noise. I at once jimiped up,

rushed, as well as the violent motion would permit me. into tlie front garden, tlie motion

increasing in violence, accompanied by a roaring as if a large number of cannon were being

fired near together, and by a great dust caused by the falluig chimneys. The motion at fii-st

--was a sharp jerk back and forwards in a N.E. aud S.V/. direction, increasing iu extent and

rapicUty, until I got into tlie garden say 25 seconds ; it was then succeeded by a shorter

and quicker motion at right angles, for nearly the same time, still increasing, but appearing

to be perfectly in the plane of the horizon. This was followed by a continuation of both,

a sort of vorticose motion, exactly like the motion felt iu an ill-adjusted railway carriage

on a badly-laid railway at a very high speed, where one is swayed raiiidly from side to side.

Tliis was accompanied by a sensible elevatory impulse ; it gradually subsided ; and the

above, constituting the fii-st and greatest shock, lasted altogether, I should say, 1' 20" or 1 A'
at Wellington. The earth continued to vibrate all night like the panting of a tii-ed horse,

with occasional shocks of some violence, decreasing in frequency and violence towards

morning, and nearly all in the N.E. S.W. direction, some of them a single jerk back and

forwards like tliat of one railway carriage toucliing another, but generally they were

followed by a vibration gi-aduaUy decreasing. These lasted, with increasing intervals, until
I left WeUinglon on the ilth April. For the first week after the fii-st shock, the vibration

never wholly ceased. All the brick buildings in Wellington were overtlu·o^vn, or so in jm-ed,

as to necessitate their removal                                                                                                                         the Hutt Bridge was throwTi down                                                                                                                                                tlie hill-sides    opposite

Wellington were very much shaken, as evidenced by the many bare patches wth which

they were chequered fully to the extent of one-third of their surface, whence ti-ees had been

sliaken off: tliig range, particularly its lower portion, appeared to have been the most

shaken. It is called the Eimatuka Eange, and divides Port Nicholson and the basin of

the Hutt from the Warumrapa Valley, where the earthquake was felt with gi-eater violence

than at Wellington, the gi'ound having opened in many places 8 or 9 feet, and sunk in one

place for 300 yards square to a depth of 8 or 9 feet. The cracks are very frequent, and

at first were of considerable depth (deemed unfathomable, because people covild not see

their depth), perhaps 15 or 20 feet in depth, and extending for many hundred yards.

Ploughed ground and mud, di-y river- or pond-beds were tlu-own up into all sorts of un-

dulations like a short cross sea, the ridges in some cases 2 feet in height, the prevailing

direction of cracks and ridges being generally at right angles to the apparent line of force,

N.E. S.W. The strata about Wellington and the Eimatuka are a sort of shale and clay-

slate, all broken into  pieces  not bigger than road-metal,  -with                             yellow  clay joints and in
                                                                                                                                                               ;

places where the overlying clay has been cut tlu-ough by roads, one can see the cracks

caused by former earthquakes filled up by a different-coloured material. I should mention

the great sea-wave which came in immediately after the fii'st shock, about 5 feet higher than

the highest tide inside the harbour, and 12 feet liigher outside ; the tide {i. c. water-siwface)

continued ebbing and flowing every 20 minutes dm-ing tlie night, and was most irregular

for a week, ebbing fiu-ther than ever known before. After that time it became more regular

and now the ebb and flow is the same as before the earthquake ; but since that, it does not

come at high-water within 3 or 4 feet of its former height, proving that the whole south-

ern part of the northern island has been raised, the elevated portion commencing at

Wangarner, on the west coast, and going roimd to Castle Point on the east, where it

terminates. The vertical elevation is greatest at the Eimatuka Eange, outside Port Nichol-

son, and becomes nil at the above-mentioned points. The shock was felt at Nelson

almost as badly as at Wellington, slightly at Canterbm-y and Ahurii. It was most violent

on the sides of hills at those places, and least so in the centre of the alluvial plains.

" The great shook continued at any one point longer, the further it had diverged from its

apparent centre of action opposite Wellington, and became less violent, the motion bemg

slower and not to such an extent. This I tliink plainly proves (if any tiling were wanting to

prove) Mr. Mallet's wave theory : any person of the slightest perception exj^eriencing the

shock and comparmg the statements of persons who had felt it in different places could

come to no other conclusion. I do not think the thermometer or barometer was affected
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

I had no opportunity of  observing  myself;  but so  I  heard                                  nor was the  compass acted on
                                                                                            ;

more than was due to the motion.

  m" The captain of the vessel I went to Alim-ii was outside Port Nicholson, lying-to in a

gale, and thought his vessel had struck, and was dragging over a reef of rocks ; the next

morning he passed himdreds of dead fish all of one sort, a species of ling, whose habit it is

to lie on the bottom. The shock was also felt by the ' Josephine WilUs,' 150 miles off the

coast. I only regret, time and want of means prevented my making more accurate obser-

vations, and even giving you. those I did make in greater detail.                                           W. 0. B."

chaui, reaching from the interior down to Wellington, and also in that pomting to Tou-

gm-o and other volcanic cones. E.M.]

                        BIBLIOaEAPHT OF EAETHQUAZES.

   At tlie period of publication of the Second Report on Earthquakes, it was

my intention to have prepared a complete Bibliography of Earthquakes, the

want of some such iudex having been much felt by myself, at former periods.

Subsequently, however, I found that my fiiend. Professor Pcrrey, of Dijon,

had had such a work in. progi'ess for some years ; and he has siuce piiblished
his Bibliographical Catalogues in the ' Mcmoires de I'Academie Imp. de Dijon,'
vols. xiv. and xv. 2nd ser., for 1855-56, which contaiued, in alphabetical
order, one thousand eight hundi'ed and thirty-seven different works on Seis-
mology. Even yet, however, the store of literatui'e in this speciality are not
completely taken stock of. I have hence deemed it best simply to publish,
in the following lists, such works as I have found in the several European
libraries named at the head of each separate list, along with one iu which

works, that from various sources have met my eye, are collected. The ma-

terials thus given "wiU be, 1 should hope, of some present service to scientific

  --1756. Very remarkable. He speaks of chains of mountains as long levers communi-

    cating the volcanic force applied at one end to the other, the principal effect being felt at

   that other, as, when a long row of balls is struck at one end, the last one moves. He says
   also that those forces are not so much felt in the extremities of brancli chains, because

    these are composed of more sandy materials, wliich do not transmit the shock so well.
   There is also much more about the action of subterranean bodies of water, &c. The book
    is small, 52 pages.

     --Desiderata Ill-understood 'Phenomena^ ^c.

  --Gi-ent Sea- Waves. Perhaps the best account that has yet been given of the phe-

 nomena of great sea-waves (due beyond question to earthquake or volcanic movement
 of sea-bottom), was communicated by Prof. Bache to the American Association for

 the Advancement of Science, and was reprinted along with a paper " On the Tides

 of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean," in 1856, in a separate form by Prof. Bache, at

 New Haven for private circulation, from which the following are extracts.
    On the 23rd of December, 1854, a violent earthquake occurred in the neighbour-

 hood of the Island of Niphon (Japan), the local sea- waves of which wrecked the

 ARussian frigate ' Diana,' anchored in the harbour of Siraoda. correspondent of the

--'New York Herald,' writing from Shanghae, states,- "At 9 a.m. on the 23rd of

 December, weather clear, therm. 72°, barom. 30°, a severe shock of an earthquake
 was felt on board the frigate, shaking the ship most severely. The shock lasted
 full five minutes, and was followed at quick intervals by rapid and severe shocks
 for thirty minutes." At Qh. 3m. a.m. the sea was observed washing into the bay
 in one immense wave 30 feet high, with awful velocity ; in an instant the town of
 Simoda was overwhelmed and swept from its foundations. "This advance and
 recession of the watei's recurred five times ". . . . " by 2h. 30m. p.m. all was quiet."
 The log-book of the 'Diana' states that "the disturbance commenced at 9h. 15m.,
 and that the rising and falling of the water in the bay produced a sudden variation
 of depth from less than 8 feet to more than 40 feet. The frigate was by this laid four

--times upon her side, once in less than 4 feet of water." Commodore M. C. Perry,

U.S. Navy, states, "That the whole eastern coast of Japan seems to have suffered
from this calamity. Yedo itself was injured, and the fine city of Osaka entirely
destroyed. At 3 p.m. a fresh west wind was blowing at Simoda. The agitation
of the water and the movement of the vessel had become very slow ; barom. 29°'87>
therm. 10°-5 Reaum. (=55°-63 Fahr.)."

   From other sources quoted by Prof. Bache, it appears that on the same day
(23rd Dec), at Peel's Island, one of the Bonin Islands, there was also (the hour
not stated) a sudden wave rise of 15 feet above high water, followed by a recession
which left the reefs entirely bare. The tide continued to rise and fall at intervals of

fifteen minutes, gradually lessening until the evening. Again on the evening of the
25th of December (as to which time there is no account of a second earthquake),
the water rose in like manner 12 feet.

   The United States Coast Survey, so ably superintended by Prof Bache, possesses
stations of observation furnished with self-registering tide-gauges, at San Diego,
San Francisco and Astoria, on the Pacific Coast ; and Prof. Bache presented to the
Association the curves traced by those instruments, in which the comparative
heights and times, and the mean heights and times at San Francisco and San Diego,
are given ; also the tidal curves for both, with the abnormal oscillations superimposed;
and lastlj', three diagrams, in which the tidal level being reduced to a horizontal line,
the abnormal waves alone are shown, for Astoria, San Francisco and San Diego.

    I can only refer to the original for the full results deducible from these valuable
observations, and repeat here in brief some of their facts :

    " The San Francisco curve presents three sets of waves of short interval: the first
begins at 4h. 12ra. and ends at 8h. 52ra., the interval being 4h. 40m. ; the second begins
at 9h. 35m. and ends at 13h. 45m., the interval being 4h. lOra. ; the beginning of the
third is about 13ijh., and its end not distinctly traceable. The crest of the first large
wave of the three sets occurred at the respective times of 4h. 42ra., 9h. 54m., and
14h. 17m., giving intervals of 5h. 12m., and 5h. 23m."

    "The average time of oscillation of one of the first set of waves was 35m., one of
the second 31m., and one of the third about the same. The average height of the
first set of waves was 0"45 foot on a tide which fell 2 feet ; of the second 0'19 foot

 on a tide which rose 3 feet; and of the third 0"19 foot on a tide which fell about
7 feet ; the phenomena occurring on a day when the diurnal inequality was very
 considerable. The greatest fall of the tide during the occurrence of the first set of
 waves was 0'70, and the corresponding rise 0"60 foot. In the second set the corre-
sponding quantities were 0'30 and 0"20 foot ; in the third these waves would not have
attracted general attraction." There is a general analogy in the sequence of the
waves of the three sets, which seem to mark them as belonging to a recurrence of
the same series of phenomena. The series itself looks like the result of several
 impulses, not of a single one, the heights rapidly increasing to the third wave, then
diminishing as if the impulse had ceased, then renewed and then ceased, leaving the
oscillation to extinguish itself. If we had a corresponding account of the facts as
they occurred at Simoda, the subject would lose the conjectural or rather the in-
complete character that belongs to it. Although there is no account of the place of
origin of the earthquake, yet its violence on the Japanese coasts and its diminished
effects at Peel's Island, as well as the times of arrival of the waves at the Japanese
and Pacific American coasts, prove that it must have been beneath the sea, and not
far distant from Japan. "Five distinct waves in succession rolled in at Simoda;
eight are shown by the San Francisco gauge, of which seven were of considerable
height." It seems not improbable, although this does not appear to have occurred

to Prof. Bache, that three of the San Francisco waves may have been reflected waves
only. The highest wave at Simoda was estimated at 30 feet, at Peel's Island 15 feet,

at San Francisco 0'65 foot, and at San Diego 0"50 foot.
   At San Diego, the gauge shows distinctly the same three series of waves. The

first begins at Ih. 22m. later than at San Francisco, correcting for difference of
longitude, and ends 52m. later. The interval is 30m. less than at San Francisco,
the oscillations being rather shorter than at the latter point. The second begins at
54m. later than at San Francisco and ends 34m. later. The third begins
about 54 ra. later than at San Francisco. The average time of oscillation of the
                                       --

--126 REPORT 1858.

first set is 31m., of the second 29m., being thus respectively 4m. and 2m. shorter
than at San Francisco. Tiie average height of the first set of waves was 0'17 foot
lower than at San Francisco, and the second as much higher. This fact, taken witli
the difference in the times of oscillation, induces Prof. Bache to suppose that the
difference in the two series was due to interference, which is also suggested by the
position of San Diego in reference to the islands separating the Santa Barbara Soupd

from the ocean.
   The difference in the periods of tide on the arrival of the waves at each place

would tend to produce discrepancies. The first series at San Diego arrived on a
rising tide of 4 feet, while at San Francisco it was upon a falling tide of 2 feet. The
second at San Diego arrived at near high water, and was chiefly upon a falling tide
of 7 feet, while at San Francisco it was upon a rising tide of 4 ieet.

   The forms of the waves accord remarkably at both stations.
   The tide-gauge at Astoria gives less instructive results, the bar at the entrance of
the Columbia River having no doubt broken up and greatly reduced the waves, even
if they arrived at the entrance unbroken. The gauge showed a disturbance, but
irregular and confused, which was also apparently preceded by (other) unusual
oscillations of the water; and Prof. Bache sees reason to think that the San Diego
gauge indicates disturbances of the water of an abnormal character previous to the
great earthquake shock, as well as following it at intervals for several days. The
normal time for high and low water does not seem to have been disturbed by the
superposition upon the tide-wave of the abnormal or earthquake waves.
   From these results Prof. Bache draws the following conclusions as to the rate of
translation of the great sea- waves of the earthquake.
   The latitudes and longitudes of the stations ^re :

San Diego      Lat. N.  Long. W.            Time.
San Francisco                              h. m.
Simoda            o/           o/
                                            7 49
               32 42    117 13              8 10
                        122 26
               37 48    121 62             14 44
               34 40

   The distance from San Diego to Simoda is therefore 4917 nautical miles, and from
San Francisco to Simoda 4527 nautical miles. Assuming the first account of the
disturbance at Simoda at 9 a.m. or at 22d. 23h. 44m. Greenwich mean time, and the
first great wave 30 minutes afterwards. Prof. Bache proceeds to calculate the rate.
There appears to be some typographical errors in the figures, which slightly affect the

result which he arrives at, viz. 363 miles per hour, or 60 miles per minute. Cor-

--recting the erroneous figures, the result would appear to be, the first disturbance at

San Francisco was at 23d. 12h. 22m., or 12h. 38m. after that at Simoda, and the
first great wave at 23d. 4h. 42m., giving the same interval (of 30m.). The distance
and time therefore give a rate of 368 miles per hour, or 5"96t) miles per minute.

   Assuming the second account (9h. 15m.), the time of transmission when reduced
would be 12h. 13m., and the rate of translation 370 miles per hour, or 6*20 miles

per minute.

   The San Diego observations, assuming 9h. Om. as the time of transmission at
Simoda, give I3h. 50m., which, when reduced, gives a rate of translation of 355
miles per hour, which is almost identical with the corrected reduction of the San

Francisco observations.
    Although not directly connected with our subject, it is interesting to state that

Prof. Bache deduces from these results a probable mean depth for the Pacific Ocean
on the paths traversed by these great sea- waves of from 2100 to 2500 fathoms.
(See also Amer. Journ. of Science, vol. xxi. 2 ser. January 1850.)

    I deem no apology needed for this lengthened abstract of Prof. Bache's communi-
cation, not only because it is, up to the present time, almost the only i-ecord of
scientific pretensions, of the phenomena of earthquake great sea-waves, but as a

model for those who may be engaged in tidal observations upon British or
European coasts, of what is needed to make their results connect usefully with the

requirements of those occupied in seismical inquiry. The extreme value of self-
registering tide-gauges, and the great importance of multiplying these round our

own coasts, and upon those of our Mediterranean and antipodal stations, are forcibly
shown by the remark of Bache, that but for these instruments, the very
 ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 127

occurrence on the North American coast of these sea-waves, which had traversed
the whole vast breadth of the Pacific, a distance equal to one-fifth of the earth's
circumference, would have actually passed unnoticed. Had there been a competent
self-registering tide-gauge at Simoda, we could probably have fixed exactly the spot
beneath the ocean at which the earthquake disturbance originated.

There is also a class of doubtful great sea-ioaves, for the investigation of which

such self-registering instruments would afford precious data.

It has been many times observed at various stations round our own British coasts

(as well as abroad), that abnormal tides have occurred, or that solitary waves of

translation have reached the shore, at abnormal periods, or at uncertain periods of

repetition, which could not be confounded with any recognized tidal phenomena.

Such waves have veiy customarily been referred to earthquakes for their origin of

late years                                      yet very  many  examples  occur  in  which  there  has  been no account of
                                             ;

contemporaneous earthquake, either in the offing at sea, or in any other direction.

And the question arises, are such abnormal waves always to be attributed to earth-

quakes (whether observed or not), or may they possibly be produced by some nodal

action or other disturbance far out at sea of waves of other classes, and if so, of what

nature ?

It will be advantageous to adduce some examples, and the rather, as I am enabled,

through the obliging attention of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, to
state one of much interest and in some detail, of which no full account has yet

appeared.

But first we may notice such an occurrence on the coast irear Whitby, Yorkshire,

copied from the York ' Herald ' of March 8, 1856, for which I am indebted to Mr.

William Gray of York.

  ' Robin Hood's Bay.-- On Sunday last, the 2nd instant, at 10 a.m., the tide being

--then about two-thirds flood, the following phenomenon was observed : The rocks,

which had been bare just previously, were observed to be completely submerged.
The water then fell back, and again returned, rushing with considerable force over

the rocks and beach. This was repeated two or three times, the water running up a
moderately inclined beach the distance of thirty yards.

  "A remarkable phenomenon of the tides was observed at Whitby on the 2nd

in'St. At a quarter to ten o'clock in the morning, being an hour and a quarter
before high water, the sea suddenly rushed up Whitby harbour, rising in dif-
ferent places from 18 inches to 3 feet, driving a laden lighter from its moorings,
and causing much commotion amongst the small craft. It then receded, but was
followed by other and similar waves, so that the tide appeared to ebb and flow six

times in the space of little more than an hour. A vessel, which was entering the

harbour at the time, was alternately afloat and aground on her passage up, according

to the level of the water. About midnight of the same day, the harbour-officers

observed a recurrence of the event, and in the first hour of Monday the rush of
water appeared to be much more powerful than on Sunday morning. About eleven
o'clock on Sunday night, Mr. Tose, the haibour-raaster, having observed a mark
which indicates that the tide was sufficiently high for a vessel then in the roads to
enter the harbour, went up the lighthouse and lit the gas-signal. On his return to
the pier, he was astonished to find that though the tide ought to have risen higher,
it had fallen considerably below the mark. Being afraid the vessel would take the
harbour, he was about to extinguish the light, when suddenly the tide rose far above
the mark above referred to. At Staithes and Robin Hood's Bay, the phenomenon
was also observed. The rushes of water resembled what are known in some rivers
as ' bores,' but on a much larger scale. Such phenomena often accompany sub-

terraneous disturbances, and on some occasions they have been terribly destructive.
As no earthquake has been felt in these parts recently, it is difficult to account for
the phenomenon, and it can scarcely be referred to atmospheric causes. It would
be interesting to learn whether a similar occurrence took place on other parts of the
coast. Dr. Young, in his ' History of Whitby ' (page 792), remarks, ' To volcanic

agency may be ascribed this remarkable phenomenon, that on the l7th July, 1761,

the tide rose and fell at Whitby four times in an hour.'
   Analogous phenomena have been observed at Pegwell Bay, on the southern coast,

during the present year.

   The following documents refer to the observations of such waves made upon the

coast of Wexford, Ireland, in 1854.

The 'Wexford Independent,' a local journal of the 27th September, 1854, gives

professional helmet-diver, who has done so much for the improvement of the new pier

of Kilmore, by blasting and removing the rocks which impeded its entrance, for the

following account of an extraordinary phenomenon, witnessed there on Saturday

evening, Sept. l6th, 1854. 'I was' (writes Mr. Campbell) 'in one of our boats

seeking after some implements, and net looking seawards, when, on a sudden, I heard

a mighty rush of water against the back of the pier, and in a moment it came

sweeping round the pier-head, full 3 feet high and abreast. It was within one hour

and a half of low water at the time. The inner dock was crowded with tlie small

sailing craft of the place, and quite dry, the tide being more than four hours

on ebb. In less than five minutes every boat was afloat, and we had high water.

In five minutes more the water ebbed again to the lowest spring-tide. This was

repeated seven times in the course of two hours and a half. St. Patrick's Bridge was

alternately dry and covered to the extent of a mile, and the sea formed a cascade

from end to end of it, the influx appearing to come from the east. At the same time

the sea was not by any means rough nor heaving. Standing on the top of the
parapet wall of the pier, I could descry two different currents running parallel, and

counter currents to these quite visible, the discoloured water running east at a rate

of ten or twelve miles an hour, and the intervening water of the original green hue,

and stationary. These tide currents were as far out as the shore of the Saltee
Islands. I can only compare the current to the opening of a sluice gate. There was

no damage done to any of the craft, more than the bursting of a few warps. Had

the occurrence taken place at the period of high water, the result would have been the

have often heard old people of that place say that on the Sunday after Lisbon was

destroyed by the earthquake of November 1, 1755, the day being remarkably fine,

the sea at Kilmore suddenly rose and fell in like manner. This occurrence the other

day has been owing, no doubt, to some similar and distant cause.'
   The phenomena alluded to in the above paragraph, from the 'Wexford Indepen-

dent,' are not unknown on the Waterford coast, and are there popularly termed

'death waves.' It is not very long since two ladies had a narrow escape of being
washed out to sea at Dunmore, by a sudden wave, which surprised them whilst seated

at a considerable distance above high- water mark on the beach.
   Repeated instances are on record of such waves upon the north-east coast of

England and upon the south-west coast of Ireland, as well as in many other places

(see also Second Report, p. 47-48), and even on the east coast of Africa.

   For the following, I am indebted to the Commissioners of Public Works, Ireland :

                                                                  " Office of Public Works, October 19, 1854.

--" Sir, I am directed to transmit herewith a copy of a report which the Board

have received from James B. Farrell, Esq., County Surveyor of Wexford, respecting

an extraordinary tidal phenomenon at Kilmore on the coast of that county on the

I6th ultimo. The Board send this report, considering it will be interesting to you,

on the subject of earthquakes, to which you are giving your attention.

which was an account of the tidal phenomenon at Kilmore.

   " Since then I have made inquiries along the coast, tracing from New Ross round

by Ballyhack, Arthurstown, Duncannon, Hook Head, Slade, Fethard, Bannow, and

on towards Carnsore Point.

"As far as Bannow nothing unusual was observed. The Coast-Guard near there.

although one was, as is customary, on the ' look-out ' at the time of the occurrence,

noted no disturbance. It appears to have been perceived about tvfo miles east of

Athis station, near the point indicated bj' the line on the accompanying map,

Plate XIII., and seems to have been confined between this and the line B. At
'Ballyhealy,' a little further east, it was not observed.

   " From inquiries into the details of the appearance, I learned from Mr. Campbell

at Kilmore, that six distinct ridges of water, about 2 or 3 feet high, passed from the

west towards the east, very much discoloured and carrying with them large quan-
tities of sea- weed. There was a considerable space between each pair in which the
water was of its usual colour, and quite calm, as was the sea generally, there being

no wind to disturb it.
   "These ridges did not proceed in (broken?) waves, but in continuous lines, and

passed on apparently unchecked, while the tide rose and receded on the shore within

them, which it did seven times. It is stated that, at the second reflux, the water fell
lower than it was ever known by the residents there to fall before.

   " It would appear that the ridges maintained their velocity sufficiently to force
back the ebb, which flows rapidly round Carnsore Point (nearly three knots an hour)
until they passed St. Patrick's Bridge, where the ebb-tide regained its motion west-
ward in the shape of the ' cascade ' mentioned by Mr. Campbell in the printed

account.

   " The disturbance lasted, according to his statement, from 20 minutes past 4 to

nearly 7 o'clock p.m.

   " On inquiring at the ' Bar of Lough,' I found that at about half-ebb the watch-
man at the Coast-Guard Station, who was in the watchhouse, which is built on the

edge of the sea, felt the floor tremble under his feet, and at the same time the fire-

irons and other articles of furniture shook and rattled audibly. He was also startled
by ' an extraordinary noise ' outside. On going out to ascertain the cause, he found
that a large wave was forcing back the ebb. This was repeated three times. The

first wave only, however, was accompanied by noise.

  A" schooner was lying inside the Lough, at the place marked C, from the master

of which, I learned that his vessel was three times swung round, standing alter-
nately to the flood and ebb. He was below, when he had the first intimation of it,

and described his being affected with a strange sensation, as if he were getting sick.

This I believe is not uncommon in cases of earthquake.
   " Mr. Lett, R.N., the Coast-Guard officer here, upon whom I called, made to me

a statement confirming what I had collected by inquiry.
   "There seems little doubt that the whole thing was caused by a slight shock of

earthquake.

   " From the information I had at Kilmore from Mr. Campbell, I have laid down

lines on the accompanying map, exhibiting the ridges as described by him, and

endeavouring to illustrate, by the curved arrows, the action of the ebb-tide upon

them.                     "James B. Farrell, Wexford County Surveyor."

   " With reference to the communication addressed to you on the tidal action on
Wexford coast, I may mention that since it was sent to you, further information
shows that it extended beyond the limits marked by Mr. Farrell, having, by the

report of the Coast-Guard, turned Carnsore Point : he has written to the Inspect-

ing Commander of the Coast-Guard, to request he will follow it up, and ascertain
how far north the effect was observed.

Referring to Plate XIII., it would appear probable that the primary cotidal line of

these waves was about in the direction C C of the heavy dotted line, and that the

change of direction, on approaching the shore about B, was due to the conjoint

effects, of the meeting ebb tidal-stream round Carnsore Point, of reflection at the

Saltees, and of inequality of bottom on reaching the inshore shoal-waters.

An almost identical train of phenomena occurred at the same point upon the

Wexford shore on Sunday, 12th September, 1841. The account is given by Milne,

--130 REPORT 1858.

--from a Wexford newspaper : "The day was misty and dark, wind S.S.W. to S.

Thunder heard at noon ; wind lulled, and fog became dense. At Kilmore, ten miles
south of Wexford, and directly opposite the Saltee Islands, about noon, a number of
short, loud, smothered reports like cannon were heard. The tide had flowed consider-
ably at the time, and the fishing-boats at the pier were all afloat, when, within the
space of two or three minutes, the water suddenly receded from the pier, and people
walked dry-shod where a little before there had been five to six feet of water.
After a few minutes, again the tide began as suddenly to return ; and, after re-
suming its level, continued to rise to high water in the usual way. There was no
extraordinary commotion, only an increased surf. The sky cleared after thunder
and showers."

  The question, however, here chiefly in point is, whence come these waves? what is their
origin ? The direction of translation, on entering the wide Bay of Ballyteague, here was
almost exactly from the south-west, and if transmitted from a considerable distance,
the origin of disturbance must have been beneath the deep waters of the Atlantic
Ocean, and it is scarcely probable that an earthquake blow sufficiently powerful to
have originated waves so large after so long a transmission, should have occurred and
not have been generally felt in the South of Ireland, where the hard and elastic cha-

racters of all the formations are so favourable to the distant transmission of impulses.

It is equally difficult to assume, as here operative, a condition which upon coasts

of shoal water and encumbered with banks and bars, may unquestionably originate

great sea- waves, and which very probably is actually the cause of those of not un-
frequent occurrence upon the east and south-east coasts of England.

   Almost all great submarine banks are constantly subjected, at the same time, to
aggregation by deposition, and to partial degradation, by the sweeping away of
material along their bases and flanks, by tidal action, either constant or at certain
periods of tide. Deposition takes place by vertical, or more or less inclined preci-
pitation of suspended matter; this form of degradation, by horizontal removal.
The conjoint efifect is very frequently to increase the steepness of the angle of slope
of the degrading flank of the hank, matter being constantly added on top and re-
moved from lower down, and with most energy at a level intermediate between the
surface-water and bottom.

  A time arises, therefore, at which the angle of slope of the bank is increased be-

yond the limits of repose of the material, whether mud, sand or gravel, or any mix-
ture of these ; and then a great under-water slippage takes place, and a mass often
of enormous magnitude at once slides from the top and flank of the bank down into
deep water, and spreads and levels itself out upon the bottom, to be in its turn swept
away and replaced by fresh materials and to give rise to another slippage. Thus, in

&figs. 9 10, if s, s represent the surface of the sea, b, b (fig. 9) the sea-bottom in

                                                                          Fig. 9.

transverse section through the flank of the bank in a plane at right angles to the
stream of abrasion ; then, at the point where the equilibrium of repose of the mass
is lost, the mass r, n slips and is suddenly transported from its original position to

n, m. The effect upon the surface of the sea, is at the same moment to originate a
positive and a negative wave, w and v, whose crests shall more or less approximate

to the general line of the flank of the bank ; and these will be immediately succeeded

by two solitary waves of translation, a greater, w (fig. 10), and a less, v, whose mo-

tions of translation will be opposite.
 ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 131

   The magnitude of the wave raised is dependent upon that of the mass of solid
material that has suddenly changed its place, upon the depth of water in which the

                                                                          Fig. 10.

slippage has occurred, upon the rapidity of the transposition, and in a minor degree

upon the form and material of the portion of the bank that has slipped. Where the

depth of water is very great, its effects at the surface may be quite insensible at the

place ; but when this low broad flattened wave of only a few inches becomes heaped

up on shelving shores or tidal estuaries, it may then become very apparent, and

perfectly so to accurate tide gauges. Where the water is comparatively shallow,

as it usually is where large and heavy banks occur, there the undulatory effects on

Wethe surface, even at the seat of disturbance, will be considerable.  have then

a simple mechanism abundantly sufficient to account for the occurrence of some

such abnormal tide-waves or great sea-waves as have been noticed ; but while thus
a vera causa, is it the cause of any of those phenomena that have been observed,

and which do not appear to have been accompanied by earthquakes? This, as well

as all the hydrodynamic phenomena of such sea-waves, I would commend to the

careful attention of future observers. (See First Report, p. 61.)

  --Stoppage of Rivers. Throughout earthquake narratives, nothing is more commonly

recorded amongstthe secondaryphenomena,than sudden derangements of the ordinary
and prior regimen of springs, wells, and especiallyof rivers. Almost all such facts admit
of simple explanation ; and in the case of rivers, the sudden drying up or stoppage of

their streams, has been most usually due to sudden damming up by the fall of debris
of rocks from precipices, &c. across the river-beds, usually at narrow gorges, where
the damming can easily take place, and whence it is, by the posterior rising of the
waters, afterwards swept away or gradually removed by floods, &c. ; often also on a

granderscale,it arises from the occurrence ofgreatlandslips (in countriesof deep alluvial

or other little coherent formation), bulging out into the river-beds, and temporarily

shutting them up, and either forcing the streams into new channels, or damming
them up until the waters produce a debacle and sweep away the obstacle.

    But not a few cases are upon record of sudden stoppages in the ordinary supply
of water in river streams, not known to have been connected with any earthquake,
or with any sufficient and explainable cause. Perhaps the phenomena cannot be
more briefly set forth than by transcribing a notice from ' Chambers's Edinburgh

Journal' for Jan. 19, 1839, No. 364. p. 412 :--

  --" Late Stoppage of Rivers in the South of Scotland. Most of our readers have

probably read the accounts which appeared in the newspapers of a simultaneous
stoppage of the rivers Teviot, Clyde, and Nith, on the 27th of November last; yet,

as many may not have heard of it, and few may have paid to it the attention which
it deserves, we are glad to have the opportunity afforded us of bringing the circum-
stance under the especial notice of our readers. It has, we are glad to find, been
taken up, as a subject worthy of scientific investigation ; and in this we have been

invited to assist, by endeavouring to procure information from any of our readers

who may be able to afford it. The phenomenon, it is suspected, is attributable to
some agent or cause which had acted over a very extensive range of country, and
which, probably, produced similar effects, in many other places besides the banks

of the three rivers above specified. W^e trust that if such effects were perceived by
any of our readers, they will be so obliging as accede to the proposal and the request
with which we conclude the present notice.

   " On the morning of Tuesday, the 27 ih of November last, about six o'clock, the

miller of Maxwellheugh Mill, situated on the Teviot, near its confluence with the

Tweed, perceived a great diminution taking place in the water which flowed through

his mill-course. At eight o'clock the water altogether ceased to flow. Thinking
that the sluice had fallen down, or that the caitld [dam] had given way. he went up

                                                                          k2
132 REPORT-- 1858.

to the cauld, and touad, much to his surprise, that there was hardly any water in

the river. There were here and there a few pools, where there were hollows in the

--channel ; but there was no longer a running stream. The channel continued dry

for four or five hours after which the water began gradually to flow, till the waters
reached the same level they were at previously. At this place the Teviot is on an
average about 50 feet wide, and 2 feet deep.

    " The same phenomenon took place in the Nith, in the parish of Durrisdeer, at
Enterkinefoot. The channel was so dry, that a person could have walked across

without wetting his stockings.

   " It was observed also in the Clyde, a little above New Lanark. The extensive

cotton-mills at that place were for some hours stopped, in consequence of an entire
cessation of the current. Numbers of fish were caught with the hand, and many
persons walked across without wetting so much as the soles of their feet.

    " The above particulars we have taken from the newspapers, and we do not vouch
for their perfect accuracy ; but we have no reason to doubt it, as the statements have

not been contradicted.

    " It appears that the same phenomenon has occurred frequently before. In the
Teviot, it is known to have occurred at least five times between the years 1748 and

 1787. It happened also in the Clyde in the year 1787, and within a few days of its

 occurrence in the Teviot : and it is remarkable, that, in regard to both of these rivers,

 the part of the channel where their waters disappeared, turns out to be the very
 place where they disappeared last month. But there are several other rivers, both
in England and in Scotland, where the same phenomenon has been observed within

 the last half-century.

   We" feel satisfied that our readers will share with us an extreme anxiety to

discover, if possible, the cause of this singular phenomenon : and we will now ex-
 plain to them in what way they can be instrumental in assisting in this discovery.

    " The first object should be to obtain a minute and accurate account of all the
 facts apparently connected with the phenomenon, at the places where it was observed.

We are happy to learn that steps have been taken for this purpose by persons well-

 quahfied for such an inquiry. But as it is just possible, that even they may not have

 gathered up all the circumstances calculated to throw light on the subject, our readers
 in these quarters would do well to note down, ere it fades from their memories, any

 thing particular which they observed.

   We" may now allude to the different theories which have been started to account

 for the phenomenon, because they will immediately show the importance of
 gathering together as many facts as possible. It is by facts alone that these theories

 will be confirmed or refuted.

    " Some persons ascribe the phenomenon to a severe frost which occurred on the
 morning of Nov. 27, and which, it is said, froze up the streamlets and springs that

 supplied the rivers where the phenomenon was observed. We cannot see how, on

 any philosophical principles, the effect here stated would follow from such a cause.
 But, even if it were sufficient to produce it, then the same phenomenon should have
 occurred in the Tweed, the Jed, and all the rivers where the frost reached. More-

  over, it should be observed every winter, and it ought to have been very strikingly

  observed last winter. Besides, the waters should, after the frost gave way, have

 risen considerably above their usual level, which, it is said, was not the case.

   "We have adverted to these inferences from the theory just mentioned, in order to

 show how its truth or falsehood may be tested ; and many of our readers may be in

  possession of facts which will supply this test.

     "Another theory has been proposed, which, we confess, appears much more pro-
  bable. It is suggested, that a fissure may have been formed under or across the
  channels of the above rivers, into which their waters found their way. The current
  would thus cease to flow in its ordinary channel until the fissure closed, or was
  filled up by the sediment and water poured into it. The fissure might be either a
  crack across the country, or a local sinking of the ground. It is well known that

  earthquakes frequently produce such effects; and there are few years in which, in

  some parts of Scotland and England, the shock of an earthquake is not felt. When

  the Clyde stopped in January 1787, a rivulet in the parish of Strathblane, in Stir-

  lingshire, which drove a mill, also disappeared. On the same day, the shock of an

ON THE FACTS AND THEORY OF EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA. 133

earthquake was very sensibly felt in Glasgow and its neighbourhood. Whether or
not at either of these places any fissures were observed, into which the streams
flowed for a time, we have been unable to learn. That there are fissures, or slips
(as the geologists call them), which everywhere intersect the crust of the earth, is well
known to every collier and miner; and that there are such fissures in that part of the
channel of the Clyde, where its waters have repeatedly disappeared (namely, between
the uppermost fall and Corra Linn), is extremely probable. It might be thought,
however, that, if a crack was produced, sufficient to allow the waters of a large
river to escape, it would soon be discovered. But it is quite possible, that, after the
lapse of a few hours, the crack might close again, and leave scarcely any external
traces of its existence. Still, we cannot help thinking that some traces should be
discoverable ; and this is just one of the points on which our provincial readers may

be able to afford information.

We" shall conclude by suggesting one or two points, to which, if any of our readers

would be so obliging as to investigate the subject, their attention may be directed ;

and we doubt not, other points will occur to themselves :

"          Have phenomena,  similar to                     those which occurred in the Teviot, the Clyde,
       1.

and the Nith, on the 27th of November last, been observed, on the same day, or

about the same time, in any other rivers in Great Britain ?

   " 2. If so, at what hour were they first observed, and how long did they continue?
   " 3. Where is the highest place, in the course of the river, where its waters dis-

appeared ?

  "4. Was any crack, or fissure, or sinking, or disturbance of the ground, visible at

that place ?

  "5. Was the shock of an earthquake felt, anywhere, about the period above

mentioned ?

  " 6. Was there much or any ice on the river, or its tributaries, where the aforesaid

phenomenon occurred ?

   " 7- When the water began to flow again, did it rise to a higher level than it had

been at previously ?
   "8. Is there any appearance of a slip, fault, dyke, or trouble in the strata, at or

near the place where the waters began to disappear ?

   "9- Has this phenomenon, or anything similar to it, been observed informer

--years and when ?

  We" may also repeat the queries 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, with regard to the stoppage

of the Teviot, Clyde, and   Nith                           for on the subjects of those queries with regard to
                                                        ;

the phenomenon of the 27th of November, we are as yet uninformed."

See also some analogous facts mentioned by Perrey in his memoir " On the Earth-

quakes of Europe, and adjacent parts of Africa and Asia, from 1801 to 1843"

(Comptes Rendus, Sept. 1843, last page but one of the memoir). Most of these phe-

nomena have occurred in the winter and in higher latitudes ; and although there are
considerable difficulties in the way of the frost theory of accounting for them, and I

incline to the view that it will hereafter be found to be the true one, yet there is

--sufficient to induce the question Can it be possible that partial or local elevations,

with or without fractures or earthquake, take place occasionally, and to such an

extent as to change the levels of portions of the earth's surface, and for a time

derange the flow of rivers, or other such main channels of drainage ?

   Those who embrace the views of Von Bnch and Humboldt, &c., and admit the

possibility of boursouffie domes of trachyte, will be prepared to find no difficulty in

imagining such comparatively small surfaces elevated and swollen up, by the assumed

elastic forces beneath, so as to produce new and extemporaneous water-sheds ; and
although I cannot join in such views, the subject appears to me worthy of more exa-

mination at the hands of Vulcanologists and Seismologists.

 --Nausea at the moment of shock. This curious effect of earthquake shock upon

human beings, and if accounts are to be credited, also upon some domestic animals,
is deserving of more attention than it has yet received.

   The fact itself, as respects human beings, admits of no doubt. I have direct

testimony of the boys of a large boarding-school being suddenly awakened at night
by one of the North American shocks, and the greater number suffering from imme-
--

diate sense of nausea, amounting to vomiting in many cases. In tlie late earth-
quake at Naples (Dec. 1857) many instances were related to me by the sufferers.
The question arises. Is the nausea an effect of the sudden disturbance of the
nervous system by alarm, &c., or is it due to the movement itself, and analogous
to sea-sickness .' There are great difficulties in the way of either solution. Those

most likely to suffer severely from nervous alarm, do not seem to be those most usu-
ally affected. The direct movements are very generally too sudden, sharp, and of
too little duration, to admit of the second explanation. The facts, however, require
to be more numerous, and to be scientifically collected and classified as soon after

the occurrence as possible, and are commended to such physiologists as may be

favourably circumstanced for the observation in earthquake regions.

--Indirect estimation of the force due to the shock. In our ignorance of the precise

nature of the originating impulse, whether of one or of more than one sort, or of the

degree of force at the centre of impulse necessary to transmit a wave, sensibly, to a

given distance through the common formations of the earth's crust, any trustworthy

observations, of the distance to which the very analogous blow produced by fired

mines, or other masses of gunpowder, has been sensibly conveyed, are not to be

at present neglected. The 2nd Report gives exact information as to the distances to

which such impulses from fired powder, even of a feeble character, may be conveyed

through the worst conducting material (sand), and made instrumentally sensible.

I have collected since that period a few occasional notices of the explosions of

large masses of gunpowder, and of such facts as may be found, of the magnitude and

distance of the impulse conveyed, which I here transcribe for reference. It would

be very desirable that officers of engineers entrusted with demolitions, or requiring

to explode very large masses of powder, would endeavour to provide for obtaining

observations as to the precise radius of the superficial area at which the ground

shock became insensible without the aid of instruments, and that such observations

were accompanied by a general account of the nature of the geological formation,

and of the physical features of the country around.
   " The Monster Blast at Furness.-- The monster blast of gunpowder at Furness

Granite Quarry took place on Wednesday afternoon, with complete success. The

charge consisted of no less than three tons of gunpowder, and was deposited in two

--chambers one and a half ton in each. The shaft was 60 feet in depth, and the

chambers in which the powder was placed were 17 feet long. The charge was

ignited by a galvanic battery, and lifted an immense mass of rock, computed to have

been between 7000 and 8000 tons. The flame belched out on the seaward side,

and was well seen by a large concourse of spectators from Inverary, the watering

places of the Clyde, and a party of excursionists from Glasgow, on board the ' Mary

--Jane.' The report was not loud, but deep and hoarse, and the ground in a very wide

circle was strongly agitated." Glasgow Constitutional, October 5, 1852.

   The 'Journal de Turin' of the 29th ult. has, under the head of "latest intelligence,"

the following paragraph : "Turin, ir45 a.m. Two successive shocks have been

felt like those of an earthquake. The powder magazine of Borgo Dora has ex-

ploded. The population is hurrying to the scene of disaster. The rappel is being

Abeaten. All the faubourg is on fire.  barrack has fallen down. Two hundred
--deaths are spoken of." Saunders's Newsletter, May 1852.

It is quite probable that both in this case and in that of the magazine at Mayence,

which subsequently exploded, information might still be obtained as to the weight of

powder fired and the extreme distance to which the shock was felt.

 --" Improvement of the Port of Brest. The ' Moniteur de la Flotte ' states that M.

Verrier, engineer, charged with the work of clearing away the Rose Rock, which

obstructs the entrance of a part of the harbour of Brest, called the Penfield, made

an experiment a few days ago, which was perfectly successful. One of the convicts,

covered with a diving-dress, descended to the rock at half-tide, and deposited a box

full of gunpowder, to which were fitted two gutta-percha tubes, also similarly filled.

As soon as the man had come up, a light was applied to the tubes, and shortly after

a loud cracking noise was heard, and a large column of water, with fragments of

stone and a quantity of sand and mud, were thrown up to the height of 20 feet.

The commotion was so great, that the Bastion de la Rose, which stands near.

--trembled to its foundation. The mass thus moved has been considerable." Times,

April 17th, 1857.

The following is the ' Times ' account of one of the explosions at the siege of

Sebastopol :

 --"Thursday, Aug. 30, 1855. ^The whole of the camp was shaken this morning

at 1 o'clock by a prodigious explosion, which produced the effects of an earthquake.

A deplorable accident had occurred to our gallant aUies as they were pursuing their
works with accustomed energy. A tumbrel, from which they were discharging

powder into one of the magazines near the Mamelon, was struck by a shell from

the Russian batteries, which burst as it crashed through the roof of the carriage, and

ignited the cartridges within ; the flames caught the powder in the magazine, and,
with a hideous roar, 14,000 rounds of gunpowder rushed forth in a volcano of fire to

the skies, shattering to atoms the magazine, the tumbrels, and all the surrounding
works, and whirling from its centre in all directions over the face of the Mamelon

and beyond it 150 officers and men. Masses of earth, gabions, stones, fragments of

carriages, and heavy shot were hurled far into our works on the left of the French,

and wounded several of our men. The light of the explosion was not great, but

the roar and shock of the earth were very considerable. The heaviest sleepers awoke

--and rushed out of their tents. The weight of powder exploded was about seven

tons, or 1400 rounds of lOlbs. each." Times, Sept. 13, 1855.

The following is part of the French account of the expedition against Kertch :

--"May 26th, 1855. Finally, before evacuating Yenikale, they blew up a powder

magazine, containing about 30,000 kilogrammes of powder : the shock was so great,

--that many houses were destroyed, and vessels anchored ten miles out at sea felt it

severely." ' Moniteur ' quoted by ' Times,' June 1855.

   And the following of the great explosion in the camp before Sebastopol, on the
15th of November 1855 :--

   " Shortly after 3 o'clock on Thursday afternoon the whole camp, from Inkermann

to far beyond Cathcart's Hill, was literally shaken throughout every square foot of

its area, by the most tremendous explosion that has ever echoed through these

ACrimean hills.    greater quantity of gunpowder itself may have been exploded in

some of the magazines discharged for the destruction of the buildings and works

after the abandonment of the ruined city and fortress; but this is doubtful, and

certainly there were never fired at the same time so great a number and variety of

deadly and explosive projectiles. The force of the blow from the impelled air, the

stunning noise, the flashing of the fire, the sufi^ocating smoke, arrested every reason-

ing faculty, and took away all sense, save the instinctive impulse to fly from the

source of evil. Among the regiments themselves of the light division, whether in

tents or huts, a sudden sensation was felt as if of an upheaving of the ground, at the

same time that a violent shock was experienced from the concussion of the air.

Almost instantly followed the loud report of the explosion ; not sounding as if a

single charge or magazine had been fired, and without the ringing tone or decided

character of a salvo of artillery ; but seeming rather as if a number of magazines had

been discharged, one after the other, so rapidly, that all the reports were blended into

one. As the thunder of the first report subsided, its place was occupied by the

sharp cracking sounds of shells bursting high in the air, the rush of fragments falling

to the ground, and the loud bangs of shells which had been scattered and were ex-

ploding on all sides. Simultaneous with these, almost from the very commencement,

was the crushing of wooden huts, splitting of timbers, and noise of faUing glass from

the broken windows. Tlie tents were violently agitated, and sometimes the cords

or poles were snapped asunder. Then followed a continued succession of minor

reports, and the roar of flames, and crackling of burning wood, as the fire advanced
and increased among the huts and artillery stores of the siege train depots. To say

that it equalled in violence the combined salvos of a thousand parks of artillery

might seem extravagant ; and yet the simile would but feebly convey an idea of the

volume of thundering sound that shook the earth for miles around, tearing down

the most substantial masonry and wooden huts, and levelling tents as by the sweep
of some invisible giant-arm. I had seen the explosions on and after the 8th of
September, which so many pens have since described ; but no half-dozen of them

together would have equalled this one, either in force or sound. Over an area of
nearly half a mile from the spot of its occurrence, the air was one huge column of powder
smoke and cast-up earth, up into and athwart which ignited or exploding shells
and rockets ever and anon darted and flashed by hundreds, spreading destruction to
nearly everything animate and inanimate, within a radius of more than a thousand
yards. Heavy siege guns were wrenched from their carriages and thrown many

--perches from where they had been standing, whilst the carriages themselves were

torn asunder." London Express, Nov. 29, 1855.
   The following notices of the Great Blast at Seaford Cliff are extracted from

' Saunders's Newsletter' of September 15, 1856 :

  --"The great explosion at Seaford. There has been a great concourse of visitors in

this little town today to witness the operation of 'blasting,' by the explosion of
gunpowder, an immense mass of chalk cliflF from the heights down upon the beach,

there to form a barrier which may check the drifting of the shingle towards Beachy
Head and the east. The ground about Seaford for two miles to the west lies low,

and there is nothing to protect it from the inroad of the sea at high tides but a
narrow beach bank of shingle. This barrier is becoming gradually weaker in con-
sequence of the tendency of the shingle to drift away, and it has become a matter of
urgent moment that this should be stayed. Close to Seaford, on its eastern side,
rises a noble line of cliff, in some places 300 feet high, and averaging above 200. It
was determined to project a huge slice of the cliff on to the beach, with a view
thereby to constitute a groin for the purpose of retaining the shingle and preventing
its leaving the bay. The operations have been conducted by the Board of Ordnance.

The spot selected is not much above half a mile to the east of Seaford. At a height
of about 50 feet above high-water- mark there was driven into the cliff, or excavated,

a tunnel or gallery 70 feet long, 6 feet high, 5 feet broad, ascending with a slope of
1 in 3. At the inland extremity it turned right and left in the heart of the cliff,

above 50 feet one way and above 60 the other, with a more gentle ascent, the two
smaller galleries being 4 feet 6 inches high, and 3 feet 6 inches broad, and the three
being in the form of a capital T. At the utmost end of each of the side or cross galleries
was a chamber, 7 feet cube, lined with wood ; and in each chamber a charge of no
less than 12,000 lbs. of gunpowder was deposited ; making the distance of the centre

of the charge 70 feet from the face of the cliff towards the sea, and about 70 feet
above high-water mark. The galleries were ' tamped,' that is, stopped up, with bags
of sand, and chalk in bags and loose, to within 50 feet of the mouth, both branches

being tamped up, and 20 feet down the large gallery. It was not till 12 minutes
past 3 o'clock, that suddenly the whole cliff, along a width or frontage of some

120 feet, bent forwards towards the sea, cracked in every direction, crumbled into

pieces, and fell upon the beach in front of it, forming a bank down which large I

portions of the falling mass glided slowly into the sea for several yards like a stream
of lava flowing into the water. The whole multitude upon the beach seemed for a
few moments paralysed and awe-struck by the strange movement, and the slightly

trembling ground ; everyone sought to know with a glance that the mass had not
force enough to come near him, and that the cliff under which he stood was safe.
There was no very loud report ; the rumbling noise was probably not heard a mile
off, and was perhaps caused by the splitting of the cliff and fall of the fragments.
There seemed to be no smoke, but there was a tremendous shower of dust. Those
who were in boats a little way out state that they felt a slight shock. It was much

stronger on the top of the cliff. Persons standing there felt staggered by the shaking

of the ground, and one of the batteries was thrown down by it. In Seaford, too,
three quarters of a mile off, glasses upon the table were shaken, and one chimney fell.
At Newhaven, a distance of three miles, the shock was sensibly felt. The mass
which came down is larger than was expected ; it forms an irregular heap, apparently

about 300 feet broad, of a height varying from 40 to 100 feet, and running 200 or
250 feet or more seaward, which is considerably beyond low-water mark. It is
thought that it comprises nearly 300,000 tons."

   These meagre and most imperfect accounts, as respects the object here in view,

will however, it may be hoped, direct future attention to more precise observation of

the data required.
     A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS. 137

Report on Observations 0/ Luminous Meteors, 1857-58. By the Rev.
    Baden Powell., M. A., F.R.S.,F.R.A.S.,F.G.S., Savilian Professor

     of Geometry in the University of Oxford.

 During the year which has elapsed since my last Report to the British Asso-

 ciation, I have received a considerable number of communications of meteor
 observations from various observers, especially, as on so many former occasions,

 from Mr. E. J. Lowe, as well as from other friends, to whom I am happy to

 add on this occasion the names of Dr. J. H. Gladstone and Mr. G. J. Symons.
 The last-named ob.server is the only one who has recorded any remarkable

number as seen at the August period. He has communicated many seen

on the lOth of August, 1856, and a still larger number aiow/ the corresponding
 time in 1858, few, however, 07i the 10th, but a great number on the 13th. In
some parts of England the 10th was cloudy.

    Of the various theories which have been proposed to explain the nature of
luminous meteors, some were alluded to in the Report of last year. At the

meeting of the British Association at which that Report was presented, a paper
was also communicated by Mr. Daniel Vaughan, of Cincinnati, U. S., in which
he proposed another hypothesis which seems to have considerable claims on
our attention ; it has also been given at large in liis recent work entitled
" Popular Physical Astronomy."

    The main principle of this theory is, that the author conceives the lumini-

ferous ether diffused through space, but in obedience to the law of gravita-
tion condensed round large bodies, in a more intense degree in proportion to

their mass. Hence in our system it is immensely condensed round the sun,

but feebly round the planets. When in this state of condensation, it is capable

of being acted upon so as to produce the most intense light and heat. As
existing round our earth, it can only be sufficiently condensed to produce such
effects by the immense local compression arising from the rapid motion of
meteorites. Hence their luminosity, even when far above the atmosphere but

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

on entering it, the compression is so great, according to the author's cak-ula-
tion, as to crush them to pieces.

   The details of this theory are given in the Appendix (No. 1), by some
extracts from the author's work, and also in a letter addressed by him to the
author of this Report, with the view to correct some misapprehensions of the

theory which have been entertained.
   In the Appendix (No. 2) there is given a statement which has appeared in

print, of a very singular luminous phenomenon, the nature of which it is diffi-
cult to conjecture ; but it has the appearance of being the account of a plain

matter-of-fact witness, who offers no comment or conjecture. To these, one

or two other communications have been added.

horizontally. Of this he gives various striking instances. In fact, all the

large, intensely brilliant meteors, move across the sky more or less horizon-

tally, wiiile those which fall near the perpendicular are always small and in-

conspicuous. The paths of the large and brilliant meteors of Bononia 1670,

of 1719 and 1783 in England, were horizontal, while those of Weston, U.S.,

1807, of Benares and of L'Aigle, which were less bright, moved in more in-

clined paths. He observes that the most e.xtraordinary circumstance is the

enormous apparent magnihide of the luminous mass or ball, as calculated from

the ascertained distance. Thus the Weston meteor was 500 feet in diameter,

and those of 1719 and 1783 were estimated at half a mile. Yet the quantity

of matter known to fall has been but very small in comparison. It has been

alleged that only a few fragments were attracted to the earth while the great

mass rebounded from the atmosphere, a condition which the author contends

is impossible. He is of opinion that the actual solid masses of these bodies

are very much smaller, and then adverts to the observations of Professor
Lawrence Smith (of which an account was given in the last Report), who

has assigned an optical cause for this phenomenon.

The author, however, dissents from that conclusion, and alleges that the

effect in the experiments there mentioned, of apparent great enlargement in

the discs of luminous bodies seen at a distance, is really due not to any cause

analogous to irradiation, or of an ocular kind, as there supposed, but simply

to the reflective power of the atmosphere, which he considers to be made out

1858.                                                                                ^

by placing near the luminous body any small reflecting substance, and ob-
serving at a distance the illumination which it seems thus to spread to some

distance around. In a word, he considers the eflPect in these experiments as

due to illuminated air, which became visible as distance rendered the glare

of the bright central point less overpowering to the eye.

   Now this cause he contends cannot produce any effect in the case of

meteors above the atmosphere, or even its higher rarefied regions.

" Meteoric stones, fire-balls, and shooting-stars are only luminous at or

beyond the boundary of our aerial atmosphere, and cease to be so on their

entrance into the denser air  Of the extraordinary illuminating power

of the fluid which burns around shooting-stars, we may be convinced from

the vast amount of light which these objects emit, compared with their dimi-

nutive size. Although some observers, judging from their luminosity, have
ascribed to them a diameter of from 80 to 120 feet, yet from the manner in

which so many myriads of them have been lost in the atmosphere during the

great meteoric showers of 1799 and 1833, we cannot assign to them a higher

rank than hailstones or drops of rain, so far as actual magnitude is concerned."

-(p. 95.)
   The author is led to his explanation of the luminosity of meteors from the

theory of the solar light, which assigns to the external photosphere of his

globe the locality of the luminous emanation ; and this photosphere he con-

siders to arise simply from the intense condensation upon and near his surface,

of the luminiferous ether, the same as the resisting medium, diff'used through

the planetary spaces. He rejects the idea of combustion or chemical changes

being the source of the sun's luminosity ; as these must in time become

exhausted, and the supply of light and heat be consequently interrupted. He

alludes to thequeryof Newton, asto why and howitwas that lucid matter should

be separated and made to form the sun, while opake matter was distributed

--among the minor bodies of the system. He then adds, " But there is no

ne(!essity for this unnatural division of matter; since even if the sun were

identical in composition with his attendants, yet in consequence of the great

superiority of his attraction his surface would necessarily become the focus

--in which the ether of space must display its luciferous properties." (p. 98.)
   The same law he conceives to apply to the fixed stars ; he rejects the idea

of the luminosity being due to any mechanical action on the ether dependent

on the rotation of these bodies, for then Jupiter and Saturn, by reason of their

far greater rotatory velocity, ought to be more self-luminous than the sun.

He contends that it is due to " the chemical action which may be expected

to take place in the etherial fluid as it condensed around the great sphere."

~(p. 101.)

   He raises other objections against the theory of Prof. W. Thompson, which

was briefly described in a former Report, ascribing the solar light to the im-

pact of innumerable meteors on his surface.

" The (etherial) fluid is so much rarefied in the interplanetary domain,

that no chemical changes can take place between its elements, except where

it is collected around the largest spheres and compressed by their powerful

attraction. In obedience to the law of gravity, which exerts a universal

control over all matter, atmospheres of the etherial fluid are collected around

the earth and the other large planets, but they are not sufficiently dense for

chemical action, except in cases where they receive an additional pressure

from meteoric stones sweeping through them with furious rapidity. When

these cosmicalbodies, on falling to the earth's surface, move in adirection almost

horizontal, they take a longer course through the verge of the atmosphere,

and the etherial medium is stimulated to chemical activity by the pressure^

not only from the meteoric mass itself, but also from the particles of air which
it drives in every direction from its passage. As such a chemical action must

be attended with a development of heat and light, it is not surprising that
meteorites are luminous before reaching the confines of the air, and that their
brilliancy is exhibited on a gigantic scale when their paths are almost parallel

--to the horizon." (p. 93.)
   In further illustration of these views, and to correct some misapprehension
which has existed respecting them, it will be desirable here to add an extract

of a letter to Prof. Powell from Mr. Daniel Vaughan.

                                          " Cincinnati, Ohio, October 9, 1858.

" I deem it necessary to offer an explanation of the main point of my theory,

as the idea I have endeavoured to convey in relation to it has not been cor-

rectly understood. I therefore take the liberty to say, that I do not regard

meteoric light as due to the presence of a luciferous atmosphere belonging to

the meteorite itself; for I cannot believe that any appreciable quantity of

ether or of inflammable gas could be confined around such small bodies, or

retained by their feeble attractive power after they come in conflict with the

air. On the contrary, I have maintained that the light arises from the atmo-

sphere of luciferous ether, which envelopes the earth and which is rendered

luminous by the powerful compression of meteorites as they move through it

with immense velocities.

" In obedience to the lawof gravity, the ether of space must be condensed

about all the large planets ; but it must undergo the greatest condensation

at the surface of the sun. On this vast body the density is sufficiently great

to admit an incessant chemical action, giving rise to an unfailing development

of heat and light ; whereas, in the luciferous envelope of a planet, the same
phenomenon cannot be expected, except on the fall of meteoric masses. Of

the extent to which the compression of the ether is increased by falling me-

teorites some idea may be collected from the fact, that a body flying near the

earth's surface at the rate of 20 miles a second, would impart to the air a

pressure of 150,000 pounds to the square inch, or over ten thousand times

Wethe ordinary pressure of the atmosphere.    may therefore conclude that

the etherial atmospheres of the several planets must display its illuminating

power around the meteoric body, where it is compressed as intensely as it is

on the sun's surface.

  A" certain degree of compression or density being necessary for chemical

action in the ether which maintains solar light, it cannot manifest its light-

producing energy in the wide domains of space, nor even on the planets, except

in the rare cases of meteoric falls ; and it must make the largest spheres

Myabove the theatres of its luminous action.  theory, therefore, not only

accounts for the fact that the planets are not self-luminous, but also gives

intell'i&'g-ence of the vast size of the fixed stars. Daniel Vaughan."

   Mr. Vaughan has given some account of his views to the British Associa-
tion, 1857 ; see Sectional Proceedings, p. 42 : also in some Essays published
in 1853 and lS5i, and in an article in the American Journal of Science and

   At 6j p.m. a luminous ball was seen in the region of the sky to the east of
the moon, and higher than that luminary at the time. It appeared much

larger and brighter than any star of the first magnitude. It carried with it

M'ere returning from a Lecture on Storms, delivered by Mr. Espy in the rooms
of the Natural History and Philosophical Society of Belfast, as we were
passing along the east side of College Square, a beautiful meteor appeared
for a few seconds, almost due south of us, but a little to the west, and so
 bright that you could distinctly read by its light. It was then within about
20 minutes to 10 o'clock ; the moon was shining, though at the moment ob-
scured by a cloud ; and afterwards, when I found that others had seen the
same meteor at a distance, we estimated, as accurately as we could, the alti-

tude at which it had been seen, and found it at about 30°. On the night of

 Friday, the 9th, or two days after, I travelled to Dundalk by the Dublin mail
 coach, and the guard, Joseph Hill, asked me, had I seen the very brilliant
 flash of light on Wednesday evening, at about a quarter to ten o'clock. I
 told him I had, and incjuired from him the particulars of where and how he

 saw it. He informed me of the place, which was about 5^ miles out of
 Dublin, where tiie road was very straight, and tending to the north. He had

 seen it, as he explained, almost overhead, but somewhat to his right hand,
 and it was so bright for some seconds that the entire place around was lighted
 up so that a person could distinctly read by it. It liad, therefore, been ver-
 tically over a place about 75 Ii'ish miles from Belfast, and from these data it

 is easy to calculate its altitude above the earth, which must have been about

43 miles. A few days afterwards, the same guard, Joseph Hill, sent me the

following letter and extract from the 'Warder' Dublin newspaper of Satur-
day the 10th, which confirms Hill's accuracy, as the correspondent of the

On some Points in the Anatomy of the Araneidea, or true Spiders,

  especially on the internal structure of their Spinning Organs, By
  R. H. Meade, F.R.C.S.

[A Communication ordered to be printed entire among the Reports.]

It is not my intention in the present communication to enter generally into

the anatomy of spiders, but to confine myself to an account of the arrange-
ment and structure of the parts contained in the abdomen ; and more espe-
cially to describe the glandular organs by which the silk forming their webs,

is secreted.

I was led to undertake this investigation by the hope that an accurate exa-

mination into the minute anatomical structure of the spinning organs might

clear up some important differences of opinion as to their functions. Martin

Lister, Cuvier and others, contend that spiders have the power of forcibly

ejecting the fluid which forms the silk from their spinnerets ; and are thus

able to propel a thread to a considerable distance, and in any direction.

Both the above-named naturalists state that they have distinctly seen them

shoot out their webs, but Mr. Blackwall (the greatest living authority on
Arachnology) denies that they have any such power, and says that the tena-

cious fluid is simply emitted from the extremity of the abdomen by pressing

it against some fixed point, and then drawn out into a thread by a current of
air, and wafted to some neighbouring object to which it adheres, or left

floating in the atmosphere. Should my researches fail to clear up this inter-
esting question, they may tend to elucidate some other curious points con-

--nected with the functions of the spinning organs, such as the power which

spiders have of forming different kinds of threads from the same spinnerets,

some of which are adhesive, while others have no viscidity, but simply form
a framework to support the others.

I met with considerable difficulties in the course of my investigations, had

to make numerous dissections, and at last was unable to arrive at satisfactory

conclusions on many points ; for the organs are so small and delicate, and

become so brittle when the spiders have been preserved any time in spirits,

Mythat it is not easy to separate them.  plan has been to dissect carefully

in water or spirit, under a simple lens, and then to submit each portion sepa-

rately to the actiou of a compound microscope.
--158 REPORT 1858.

   The abdomen of spiders is covered by a tough integument, consisting of
three layers : the external one is a thin transparent horny membrane, nearly
colourless, but more or less densely covered with coloured hairs ; beneath

this lies a soft layer of pigmentary matter, upon which the peculiar colour of

the body depends ; for it may be observed, that, when the hairs with which
the body of a spider is clothed are rubbed off, the integument beneath is
usually of a dark tint. The third or inner layer consists of an expanded
network of muscular fibres, which are irregularly interlaced, and which must
enable the spider forcibly to compress the abdomen. The muscles forming
this layer are very faintly, if at all, marked with transverse striae (see Plate XVI.

   At the apex of the abdomen, on the under side, is the anal tubercle, partly

concealing the opening of the intestinal canal ; and immediately in front of
it are seated the spinnerets, a group of projecting processes or mammulae;
mostly articulated, and moveable in all directions. Their number is gene-
rally six, but sometimes they are reduced to four, and, as Mr. Blackwall dis-
covered, they amount to eight in one family. They are placed in pairs,

closely grouped together. When six in number, the two anterior and two
posterior are much larger than the two intermediate ones, which in a state

of repose are hidden beneath the others (see Plate XVI. figs. 2 and 3). The
posterior spinnerets are often Inarticulate, and have the terminal joints much
prolonged and very hairy, when they have been called anal palpi, and supposed
not to take any part in the construction of the webs ; Mr. Blackwell, how-

ever, demonstrated their true character, showing that they are provided with

moveable papillas for the transmission of the silk, like the others. The ex-
ternal anatomy of the spinnerets has been so fully described by Mr. Black-
wall *, who has shown the number and arrangement of these papillas, which
vary greatly in different species and on the different spinnerets, that I need
not dwell further upon them. In Plate XVI. fig. 6, I have represented some

of them, which are like hollow bristles with dilated bases.
    In the spiders belonging to the family of the CiniJloridcB, Blk. (the type

of which is the common Ciniflo {Cluhiona) atrox), there is a fourth pair of
spinnerets. They are short, compressed, and inarticulate, and different in

appearance from all tlie others. They are seated at the base, and in front
of the ordinary anterior pair, and have each on the surface an oval flattened
space perforated witli an immense number of exceedingly minute pores, which
are the orifices of the spinning tubes (see Plate XVI. fig. 5).

   The spinnerets are connected with the surrounding integument by means
of diverging bands of muscular fibres (Plate XVI. fig. 3), which enable them
to move in different directions ; these muscles are placed immediately beneath

the skin, and their expanded extremities are inserted into it so that they are
separated with it, unless dissected very carefully.

    In the interior of the abdomen, nearer to the base than the apex, and in
female specimens opposite the opening of the oviduct, is a fixed spot, pro-
bably tendinous in character, from which muscular bands radiate in various

directions, keeping the different abdominal organs in their places. Some of

these bands are inserted into the integument on both the ventral and dorsal
surfaces of the body ; others run backwards in straight parallel bundles, and
pass into the interior of the different spinning mammulae. The last-men-
tioned fibres are strongly striated (Plate XVI. fig. 7), while those passing from
the same point to the skin, like the muscles fixing the margins of the

spinnerets to the integument, are almost destitute of striae. When the abdo-

ON THE ANATOMY OF THE ARANEIDEA.  169

men is opened, a large quantity of adipose matter comes into view, which sup-

ports and separates the different organs. In recent specimens this tissue is
formed into lobules, which are again connected by fine cellular tissue into
larger lobes (see Plate XVI. fig. 8) ; when, however, spiders have been kept for
some time in spirit, the connecting tissue disappears, the lobules break up,
and a mere unconnected granular mass remains. This reservoir of fat is a
storehouse of nutriment, which enables spiders to bear very long abstinence ;
and when they have been deprived of food for a long while, the abdomen
becomes small and shriveled. This adipose matter was described by Cuvier

and others as the liver. The chief organs which the abdomen contains are

the ovaries (in the female), the intestinal canal, and the glands for the secre-
tion of the silk. The ovaries, which shortly before the deposition of the eggs
occupy a large portion of the cavity, are seated in the central and posterior
part ; the intestinal tube runs through it, in nearly a straight direction, from
the base to the apex ; and the sacs and tubes which elaborate the material
for forming the webs, are placed in the lower, lateral, and anterior parts. I
shall confine myself to the anatomy of the last-named structures, merely
noticing with regard to one of the others, that I have generally observed the
lower part of the intestinal canal to be filled with a whitish turbid excre-
mentitious fluid, sometimes mixed with black particles*. After having been
some time in spirit, this fluid is converted into a whitish substance of the

consistence of mortar.

   The silk-glands, with their excretory tubes, which I shall now proceed to

describe in detail, are very numerous, and of very beautiful construction.
They essentially consist of a number of hollow cavities or sacs, of different

sizes and shapes, each of which is furnished with a distinct duct. None of
them or their ducts have any communication with each other, but terminate
separately at the extremities of the spinnerets. The nature and construction

of the glands are essentially similar in all the species of British and foreign
spiders that I have dissected, though they differ greatly in form and number.

As might be expected, they are most highly developed in the web-spinning

species; while in those that hunt for their prey, as the Lycosee, they are few
and small in comj)arison, with the exception of those species which are aero-

nautic in their young state. They appear to be similar in the males and

females.

   When the integument of the lower and front part of the abdomen is re-

moved, together with a thin layer of fat, and the muscles which move the
spinnerets, a large bunch of minute vesicles (just visible to the naked eye in
a large spider, such as JEpeira diadema) is Ijrought into view ; these, exa-
mined by the microscope, are found to be small transparent oval sacs about
200th of an inch in diameter in Ep. diadema, with fine and exceedingly
elastic ducts, which proceed in bundles into the anterior and posterior pairs

of spinnerets ; few, if any, terminating in the intermediate pair. When accu-

rately examined, these small glands are found to be of two kinds ; the most
superficial, which are fewer in number than the others in Ep. diadema, are
spindle-shaped, and imbedded in oval capsules of an opake finely granular
substance, which is brittle and easily rubbed off, when pressed between two
pieces of glass. I have endeavoured to represent these in Plate XVI. fig. 10 a,
and fig. 11. The other cells, which are more deeply seated, are exceedingly
numerous in some species ; they are nearly transparent, but when examined
by a good glass looli as if they were embossed, or covered with little eleva-

tions. I think this is an optical illusion, and that the appearance is due to

the interior being furnished with numerous cavities or hollows (Plate XVI.

fig. 10 b, and fig. 12).

In Ciniflo alrox and C.ferox, and probably in the other species of the same

family, there are a number of very minute sacs, imbedded in granular opake

matter, wiiich are not more than a fourth of the size of those which I have

before described ; they are of a round or pear-like shape, with the appearance

of a nucleus in the interior, and are furnished with exceedingly minute ducts.

I found them close to the spinarets, beneath the skin, and their ducts pro-

bably proceed to the minute orifices on the extremity of the extra pair of

spinnerets ; but owing to their extreme delicacy, I could not succeed in tracing

them there (Plate XVI. fig. 13).

In the middle and even upper parts of the abdomen are a number of tubular

or bag-shaped cavities, which vary much in shape, number, size, and structure

in different species ; some are hard and cartilaginous in consistence, with

transparent walls ; these present no appearance of fibres under the micro-

scope, but when forcibly compressed, crack and break into irregular frag-

ments. Their ducts seem similar in structure to the body of the sac, being

hard and brittle. In Epiira diadema and Ep. quadruta these glands are of

a large size ; in the former species there are six of them, three being on each

side; they are somewhat cylindrical in shape, and very much convoluted

(see Plate XVII. fig. 1 a). I succeeded in tracing one of their ducts into each

of the six ordinary spinnerets. In Agelena lahyrinthica they are represented

by several oval-shaped sacs, of moderate size (see Plate X^'II. fig. 1 c), quite

transparent, and so firm in consistence, that they feel like solid bodies when

taken between the fingers.

  We now come to a series of membranous sacs, of various shapes and sizes,

some being large and vermiform, others club-shaped, while others are dilated

in the middle and furnished with branched caeca. All these different forms

do not occur in the same individual, but some in one species and some in

another; they all appear, however, to resemble each other more or less in

structure. When any of the larger varieties are minutely examined, their

walls appear thickened and fibrous. Their inner surface is studded with mi-

nute cavities or hollows, giving it somewhat the appearance of the interior of a

piece of human intestine, with its valvulce conniveritcs ; thus affording an in-

creased surface for secretion. When carefully removed from tiie surround-

ing textures, they all appear coated externally by soft granular matter. I

think it probable that the blood or nutritive fluid which supplies the mate-

rials for secretion circulates in this coat, which must therefore be considered

as the cortical part of the gland. These sacs are well seen in Agelena lahy-

rinthica, where they are met with of a large tubular or clavate shape. I

have figured three (Plate XVII. fig. 7), the ducts of which I found terminating

in one of the elongated posterior spinners; fully confirming Mr. Blackwall's

opinion as to the true nature of these anal palpi, as they have been called.

In Cinijlo ferox I noticed two large branched sacs of a very peculiar form

(see Plate XVII. fig. 6).

One of the most interesting parts of the structure of these membranous

Asacs is the formation of their excretory ducts.  transparent and highly

extensible tube is encircled by a fibrous or muscular coat, which loosely sur-

rounds it, and seems to be a continuation of the outer coat of the sac itself.

When the ducts are stretched, which they unavoidably are in their removal

from the body, this breaks up into circular rings and becomes loose from the

tube within, which is exceedingly extensible, and stretches out so as to be-

come much le&a in diameter than the outer coat. This structure may be very

 plainly seen in Agelena labyrinthica and CinifloferoXy but is still more distinct
 in some large foreign spiders. I have figured a sac and tube taken from a
 large species of Olios, which I had an opportunity of dissecting through the

 kindness of Dr. Gray of the British Museum (Plate XVII. fig. 5). The ducts

 from these glands seem principally to terminate in the posterior and interme-
 diate spinnerets, but I have traced some of them (especially in Ciniflo ferox)

 into the anterior pair. When dissecting a large specimen of Mygale, I found

 that the fine ducts proceeding from the numerous small oval glands in the
 vicinity of the spinnerets had all the same structure as those I have described
 (Plate XVI. fig. Ylb). I have noticed that some of the larger ducts proceed
 parallel with, and are partly imbedded in, the fibres of the muscular bands
 which extend into the interior of the spinnerets (see Plate XVII. fig. 8).

    I shall now endeavour to draw a few physiological inferences from the facts

I have imperfectly related. Every papilla or spinning tube is furnished with
a separate duct, so that each thread which a spider spins is secreted by a
distinct gland having no communication with its neighbours ; and there can
be no doubt that different varieties of silk are secreted by the different kinds
of glands ; but it is exceedingly difficult to demonstrate the fact, as no direct
experiments can well be made in proof of it. Treviranus says that he thinks

the small glands near the spinnerets of Ciniflo atrox, the existence of which
he ascertained (I do not mean the minute ones connected with the additional
spinnerets), contain a different kind of fluid from that in the large sacs ; but
they are so small, that I do not think it possible to determine the nature of
their contents except by the colour, and that must be influenced by the struc-

ture of the walls of the sacs or glands.

  We have seen that the secreting glands are of very different sizes and kinds

the orifices in the spinnerets, and the spinnerets themselves, are also different

and reasoning upon these facts, and upon some points which may be con-
sidered as proved, in the economy of the spinning organs, I think we may be

justified in drawing certain conclusions, or rather offering suggestions as to

their uses.

    I have said that in Ciniflo atrox and allied species there is a distinct pair
of supplementary spinnerets, furnished with a fine sieve-like surface, for the

emission of a number of exceedingly delicate threads ; there are also a num-
ber of very small and peculiar looking cells, apparently connected with these
spinners; now Mr. Blackwall has distinctly shown that these spinnerets per-
form a peculiar function, spinning exceedingly fine lines of pale blue silk,
which is woven into a flocculus, as he calls it, by a most beautiful comb or
calamistrum connected with the hind legs*, which flocculus performs a pecu-
liar office in the webs of this spider. In this case there are a distinct set of

glands, connected exclusively with a distinct pair of spinnerets, so that it is
very easy to determine their functions; the other glands, however, have not
peculiar spinnerets to themselves ; therefore there must be a greater uncer-
tainty in hazarding opinions as to their uses.

   By far the most numerous, and most constant in size and shape, of the

spinning glands in spiders generally, are the small ones seated near the spin-

nerets ; these probably secrete the finer threads which form the more deli-
cate textures of their webs, construct the cocoons in which they enclose their
eggs, and the retreats in which some of the species conceal themselves.

    I remarked that the hard cartilaginous sacs were peculiarly large and
numerous in the geometric spiders, as Epeira diadema. I would suggest
that they secrete the adhesive threads, which are spirally fixed upon the

framework of elastic filaments first constructed. The common house spider

(Tegenaria civilis) is said to form no adhesive lines, and I have been unable
to find any of the cartilaginous glands in its abdomen.

   We now come to the consideration of the various shaped membranous sacs,

the ducts of which are much larger than in the cartilaginous kind, and, as I

have shown, are furnished with a fibrous coat arranged in distinct rings. I
have no doubt that these sacs form the fluid which constructs all the strong
non-adhesive threads spun by spiders, and also the floating lines or gossamer,
of the aeronautic species. In support of the latter assertion, I have found

that two of the most common among tlie aerial spiders, viz. Lycosa saccata

and Thomisus cristatus, contain these sacs in great size and number; whereas
they are erratic species spinning no regular webs, and therefore having no
other apparent use for them. In most other species of Lj'cosse the spinning
organs are in a very rudimentary state.

   I have now arrived at the most interesting, but most difiicult part of my

task, viz. the question whether there is anything in the structure of the silk-
forming organs that will decide the question as to tiie power of spiders to
eject their threads to a distance. Looking at the strong fibrous coat on the
ducts of the membranous sacs, and the fibrous tissue surrounding the glands
themselves, I think that they must possess a powerful contractile power, wliich

may also be increased by the muscular coat of the integument enabling the
spider to compress its abdomen : may not the striated bands of muscular
fibres, which run in a parallel direction down the middle of the abdomen

quite into the interior of the spinnerets, and surround the termination of the
ducts, also assist in this object? They are not attached to the tegumentary
coverings of the spinnerets like the other muscles, and cannot therefore be
for the purpose of moving these processes ; their action must be to draw the

spinnerets inwards. On examination of the pectoral muscles which connect

the legs with the cephalothorax, and which possess great power, to enable
the spider to perform its various active movements, I found that they pre-
sented exactly the same microscopic appearances as the deep abdominal
muscles, being very strongly striated ; I therefore conclude that the latter
perform some very active functions.

   In adopting the conclusion that spiders have the power of forcibly pro-

pelling the silky fluid from their spinners, I know that I am running counter

to the convictions of Mr. Blackwall, for whose opinion on all points con-
nected witli Arachnology I have the greatest veneration. That patient and
acute observer based his views upon tlie result of many carefully conducted
experiments ; he found that spiders, when placed upon an upright stick which
had its base fixed in water, could not escape when they were covered by a
glass shade, so as to prevent any movement of the air ; but when left un-
covered, in the ordinary atmosphere of a room, they emitted a little fluid
from their spinnerets, which was drawn out into a thread by the slightest
current of air, and soon became attached to some neighbouring object. I
think it very probable that a current of air may thus draw out these almost
imponderable lines in some cases, but I consider that we cannot thus account
for the formation of their threads under all circumstances and in all places.

We have also the testimony of Cuvier and others, that spiders sometimes

eject their threads simultaneously in opposite directions. Cuvier has seen
this feat performed by a Thomisus*, and Kirby and Spence quote an obser-

vation made by an anonymous author, who says he saw a small spider shoot

out obliquely in opposite directions small threads, which attached themselves

towards which they were directed *.

    Spiders are exceedingly sagacious, and vary the expedients which they
adopt to escape from confinement or to reach a neighbouring object. I was

much interested lately in observing one (Epeira inclinata) shift its position.

It was on a horizontal piece of wood, and wished to reach another piece
placed about a foot beneath it, and at a short distance from it laterally. It
suddenly dropped, spinning a thread as it fell, which of course it had first

fixed to the wood above. When it had fallen to a little below the level of

the object which it wished to reach, it stopped itself by catching the line with

one of its feet, and remained suspended in the air by the thread. It now
made several violent jerking movements, and thus acquired a swinging mo-
tion, which it managed to increase until it brought itself into contact with

the neighbouring object : as soon as this was effected, it clambered on to it,
and walked leisurely away.

--The Patent Laws. Report of the Committee of the British Association.

                    Presented by W, Fairbairn, F.R.S.

The subject of the Patent Laws lias frequently occupied the attention of

meetings of the British Association, and committees have from time to time

been appointed for the purpose of considering how those laws might be
rendered more efficient for the objects with which they are maintained.
The Rev. Vernon Harcourt, in the inaugural address at the first meeting of
the Association, held at York (September 1831), in which he expounded

the objects and plan of the Association, referred to those laws as an instance
in which fiscal regulations interfered with the progress of practical science,
and as failing to give protection to property in scientific invention to the
same extent as protection is given to every other species of property ; and
he suggested a revision of those laws as one of the subjects to which a
scientific association might be justly expected to call public attention; and
Sir David Brewster, and others, have on several occasions brought the
subject before meetings of the Association.

   By the Patent Law Amendment Act, passed in the session of 1852, the

rights of the inventor to property in the offspring of his brain, and in the
creations of his intellect when embodied in products of national industry, were
fully recognized provisional protection to that property was secured to such

                                                                        ;

inventor from the date of his application for a patent ; one proceeding was sub-
stituted, and one patent issued, extending to the whole of the United Kingdom,
instead of three proceedings and three patents separate and distinct for each
of the three countries, England, Scotland and L-eland property was created

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and protection obtained for six months by a payment of £5 ; for three years
by a payment of £25 ; and for the further terms of four and seven years, by
additional payments of £50 and £100 respectively, instead of by the pay-
ment of upwards of £300 in the first instance, under circumstances of such

uncertainty as threw discredit on the whole system ; the specifications of all
patents are to be printed and published, and sold at extremely low prices; a
benefit to the public as well as the inventor, which it would be difficult to
estimate too highly ; and, lastly, provision was made for the regulation of
matters relating to patents by commissioners furnished with ample powers
for the purpose.

   This Act came into operation on the 1st of October, 1852, and the ex-
perience of the first two years showed that the payments by inventors upon
the above scale of charges would be at the rate of more than £50,000 per
annum, without including the further or additional payments for the main-
tenance of the patents for the further terms of four and seven years, after

the expiration of the first three or seven years respectively.

   At the meeting of the British Association in Liverpool, September 1854,
a committee, presided over by the Earl of Harrowby, was appointed " for
the purpose of taking such steps as may be necessary to render the patent
system and the funds derived from inventors more efficient and available
for the reward of meritorious inventors and the advancement of practical
science." This committee communicated with the Earl Granville and Lord
Brougham, to whose exertious and watchful care the passage of the measure
                                                                                       --

                                                                               ON THE PATENT LAWS.                            165

of 1852 was mainly due; and made a report to the meeting of the British

Association, held in Glasgow in the following year, when the subject of the

tax on inventors and the appropriation of the funds so levied was fully dis-

cussed ; and another committee, consisting of His Grace the Duke of Argyll,

the Earl of Hurrowbjs Colonel Sabine, the Master of the Mint (Prof.

Graham), Mr. Fairbairn and Mr. Webster, were appointed with similar

powers. The Glasgow Committee addressed a memorial to the Lord Chan-

cellor (Lord Cranworth), calling attention to the proceedings which had

taken place at the various meetings of the British Association, to the nume-

rous questions of administration and legislation then adverted to, or which

might be expected to arise, and suggesting that Her Majesty should be ad-

vised, in accordance with the provisions of the Patent Law Amendment

Act, 1852, to appoint others than the official commissioners, and to make

the working of that Act the subject of immediate inquiry.

At the meeting of the British Association, held at Cheltenham in 1856, a

committee, consisting of the Earl of Harrowby, Lord Stanley, M.P., Mr.

Fairbairn, Prof. Graham, the Master of the Mint, Mr. James Heywood,

Mr. Commissioner Hill, General Sabine, and Mr. Webster, were appointed

with like powers; the Earl of Harrowby and Mr. James Heywood commu-

nicated personally with the Lord Chancellor ; the Lord Stanley took a warm

interest in the subject, embodying his views on the necessary alterations in

a published pamphlet; but up to this time the objects in view have not been

attained, and it will be for this meeting of the British Association to consider
what further steps should be taken.

The printing and publication of the specifications has led to results which

were hardly anticipated, as to which the following extract from a Report of

the Commissioners of Patents in 1856, will be read with interest:--

" The Commissioners of Patents have presented complete copies of all their

publications to such of the government officers and seats of learning as have

      applied for them, and to the principal towns in the United Kingdom, on con-

I dition of their being daily open to the inspection of the public free of charge.
In their selection of towns for this gift, they have been guided by the num-

ber of applications for patents proceeding from each.

   " This gift has in most cases laid the foundation of public free libraries
where none previously existed. In some instances, where the local authori-

ties hesitated to accept the works on account of the incidental expenses,

the custody has been solicited and temporarily undertaken by scientific in-
stitutions, which have modified their by-laws to enable a free admission of

the public daily to the library in which the works are deposited."

   The same Report, after enumerating a list of the places which have received

the works, says, " it is satisfactory to find that these national records of in-

vention are especially consulted by that class whose skill in the improvement

of manufactures is so essential to the maintenance of the commercial pros-
perity of this kingdom ;" and adds the testimony of the librarians of several of

the free libraries to the same effect.

    Complete sets of the Commissioners' works have been sent to the Colonies
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

brary, New York

Free Library, Boston, U.S. ; and the Honourable Charles Mason, Commis-

sioner of Patents for the United States, addressing the Commissioners of
Patents in this country, writes as follows :

   " The admirable example you have set in publishing the specifications and
drawings in full, and putting them on sale at a moderate price, so that all
can easily provide themselves with what they need for private use, will ere

long, I trust, stimulate our own Government to do the like. Nothing short
of this in the way of publication can give permanent satisfaction."

   A free library and reading-room has been opened at tlie office of the Com-

missioners of Patents, containing a large collection of works of reference,
which the same Report states to be numerously attended by professional
men, the agents of foreign and provincial inventors, and by practical mecha-
nics and operatives ; and Mr. Woodcroft has collected a large number of

portraits of inventors and of models, illustrative of the history and progress

of invention, which it may be hoped, at no distant period, will form a prin-
cipal object in a national gallery of inventors and museum of inventions.

    These and other undertakings, well suited to promote the advance of prac-
tical science and the interest of inventors, afford legitimate objects for the ex-
penditure of the surplus funds levied on inventors ; but when ample provision
shall have been made for these objects, there will be a considerable annual

surplus.

   The amount paid by patentees during the last year was upwards of
£8;5,000; and after the commencement of the payment of £100 at the
expiration of the seventh year, the amount levied on inventors will not be
found less than £100,000 per annum ; a sum, which, as being levied on
inventors and inventions, may reasonably be expected to be expended on
objects in which inventors have some interest.

   In reference to this branch of the subject, the following questions would

appear to arise for consideration :

    1. Should the present scale of payment be maintained or reduced, so as

      to leave no great surplus beyond what may be necessary for the official

        expenses?

   2. If the present scale be maintained, how should the surplus be appro-

         priated ?

   It appears that the second payment of ^650 before the end of the third
year is not made in respect of more than about one-fourth of the whole
number of patents issued, that payment being made on about 500 out of
2000 patents, so that 1500 are permitted to lapse; the cost of which in
money to the patentees cannot be taken at less than aG75,000, in addition
to the expenditure of time and labour on the respective inventions. Can any-
thing be done to diminish this loss beyond affording every facility for access
to information as to what has been done before, and the improved education

of the people ?
    In addition to these considerations and suggestions in connexion with the

new system as recently established, and which are of a fiscal character,
there are some other questions deeply affecting the interests of inventors

and the advancement of practical science, which it would not be proper to
close this Report without adverting to.

   The Patent Law Reform of 1852 was never regarded as a final measure.

It was but a first instalment obtained under great difficulty ; it only laid

the foundation of the superstructure yet to be raised. The following import-

the confirmation of rights effected by the same noble Lord ; 4. the exten-

which were omitted advisedly by the promoters of the recent measure, their
attention being directed mainly to the destruction of the existing, and the
establishment of a new system of creating property in inventions.

   These, with other amendments and matters of minor importance, which
the experience of six years of the working of the new system has disclosed,
will involve further legislation, and the consolidation and repeal of no less than
sixteen statutes, or part of statutes, an object of great importance to every

inventor.

   Your Committee now remit this subject to the consideration of the Meeting

of the British Association, deriving confidence from the belief that the times
are not unfavourable for further action, and that the town and neighbour-

hood in which the Association is now assembled may appropriately claim to

take a prominent part in the consummation of those reforms which have

occupied the attention of so many previous Meetings.

On the Lead Mining Districts of Yorkshire.
  By Stephen Eddy, Carlton, Skipton,

In comparison with the vast coal fields and iron-stone beds of Yorkshire, the

lead-producing district of  this county seems trifling                                                                                          yet in  consideration  of
                                                                                                                                             ;

the large population dependent upon the mining and manufacture of lead, it

necessarily claims our attention.

   I cannot take it upon me to say, when lead mining was first commenced in
this county ; but that many veins were discovered and worked to some extent,
at a very early period, is fully established, both by the Roman explorations

frequently met with, and the discovery in the vicinity of Greenhow Hill, near

Pateley Bridge, of two pigs of lead, inscribed with the name of the Emperor

Domitian, and bearing date a.d. 82. It is not improbable, however, that

the mines of these districts were worked at a still more remote period by the

ancient Britons.

In the earlier age of lead mining, and indeed up to a comparatively recent

period, the discovery of a vein entitled the party finding it to a grant, or

licence to work, on a certain length of such particular vein, generally two

meers ; the raeer being 28, 29, 30, or 32 yards, in different districts, re-

spectively. The width of the ground granted was confined to a distance of
8 yards on each side of the vein. This was called the " Quarter Cord."

Thus, each vein formed a distinct mine, and from the well-known fact,

that (though there is, generally speaking, a certain degree of parallelism

maintained by the major part of the veins), in each of our mining fields,

numerous intersections take place; the parties pursuing their allotted veins

frequently found themselves within the quarter cord of the adjacent sett,

and sometimes on their neighbour's vein. The result of such a system of
holding, was not only to cramp the energies of the miner, from his not having

a reasonable extent of ground for works of trial ; but also to involve him in
constant disputes and litigations with his neighbour.

The pernicious system of letting ground on a certain vein, with a given

width on each side of such vein, was however continued to a comparatively

recent date ; when parties with capital becoming connected with the mines,
and the works being so extended as to render the introduction of machinery

advisable, the necessity for grants on a larger scale was so apparent, that

small holders were by degrees disposed of, and the custom of granting setts
16S REPORT--1858.

(as they are termed) of certain extent, defined by fixed boundaries, which

has been practised in Devon and Cornwall from a very early period, is now

almost generally adopted in this county.

    Generally speaking, the various lead mines which constitute such an im-
portant portion of the mineral treasures of Great Britain, are situated on
rugged and barren elevations, and in this respect those of Yorkshire are not

exceptions.

   If we draw an imaginary line from Ilkley, bearing about 12° West of

North, for a distance of 35 miles, and then parallel ones to it, through points

10 miles east and 10 miles west from tlie centre line, we shall in this area of
700 square miles, include the high and uncultivated districts bounding

Airedale, Wharfedale, Nidderdale, Wensleydale, Arkendale and Swaledale;
in which I believe all the lead mines in this county, that have been or are
being worked to any extent, are situated.

   The strata throughout the whole of this area, are (like those of the great
lead-bearing districts of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Durham, and
also of Derbyshire) the lower members of the Carboniferous Series.

    Although the same class of rocks prevails throughout our lead-bearing
districts, we do not always find each individual stratum to occur, even in
mines in the immediate vicinity of each other ; and when they do exist, their
thickness is frequently found to vary considerably.

   It is therefore impossible to make a section, that would correspond with
every mining district, or even hold good throughout a single mining field.

    Plate XVIII. figs. 1, 2, and 3, are sections of the strata sunk through in

three of the shafts on the Grassington Mines in Wharfedale. From these it

will be observed, that even in situations so close to each other, the thickness
of the beds varies considerably.

   The greatest thickness of Limestone yet proved at Grassington is 66 yards,

whereas at the Cockhill Mines, near Pateley Bridge, only about 6 miles
distant, it is found to be at least 180 yards thick.

   In the metalliferous portion of the Carboniferous rocks, we have the
Rake Vein, the Pipe or Tube Vein, and the lateral embedded, or Flat Vein.

   The first has the appearance of a rent or fissure in the strata, extending
to a great length, and generally to an unknown depth. The second, or
Pipe Vein, has the form of an irregular tube, is met with in certain strata,
(generally Limestone), and dips with the beds, or passes more or less diago-
nally through them, for a great length. The Flat Vein is seldom met with,
except in connexion with some Rake Vein, but has always a position con-

formable to the stratum in which it is embedded.

   The Rake Veins are by far the most numerous in every district, and the
phenomena presented by them the most varied and complicated. The

greater portion of our lead ere likewise is obtained from them.

    The longitudinal course, or " bearing," of a Rake Vein, is seldom (if ever)

a perfectly straight line ; but, for the most part, it gives a tolerably direct
bearing throughout its entire length.

    The downward course of these veins varies considerably in the angles
formed with the vertical. The "Hade," or inclination, is likewise more toward
a horizontal position, in the soft or Argillaceous Beds, than in the more hard
and solid rocks ; and sometimes in passing a seam of Coal or of soft Clay, it

takes the direction of the stratum for a greater or less distance. (See figs.
4, 5, and 6.)

    The width of the vein is not uniform throughout its whole length; it
frequently opens out from a width of a foot or two, to one of as many yards,
and then contracts until it becomes a mere thread or joint.
       ON THE LEAD MINING DISTRICTS OP YORKSHIRE.          169

At the Cononley Mine in Airedale, the vein is frequently found to vary

from an inch or two in width, to five or six yards, and that, within a longitu-

dinal distance of a few feet. The width of a vein varies also with a change

of strata; it is much greater in the hard strata, where it has a more erect

position than in the soft ; it is generally more open in the Limestone than in
the Gritstone, and very much contracted in the plate or shale. Frequently

we find the vein to be 4 or 5 feet wide in the Grit or the Limestone, when

it is scarcely perceptible in the plate.

   The beginning or termination of a vein longitudinally, is seldom explored
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

where this has been done, the vein is found to ramify at acute angles, and

the branches quickly terminate.

  A remarkable instance of this recently occurred at the Grassington Mines.

In these mines, three levels were being driven eastward on the Cavendish

Vein, at the respective depths of 20, 37, and 50 fathoms from the surface.
The 20-fathom level was in a stratum, locally known as the ' Top Grit ;' the
37 in the ' Bearing or Main Grit ;' and the 50-fathom level in the Limestone.

    Each level was at the time yielding from 6 to 9 tons of rich lead ore from

every fathom driven. Many parties who went underground in this mine, after

some length of such rich ground had been explored, and while the levels

continued to yield at that rate, concluded that ground was being laid open
from which immense profits could be made, for many years to come ; and
they vv^ere correct, so far as they had an opportunity of judging ; for, had
the levels continued to open out such rich ground, no difficulty would have
been found in making a profit of 40,000/. or 50,000/. a year from these mines.

   Unfortunately a change soon took place. The first cause for apprehen-

sion noticed, was the wedge-like point of thin beds of Plate, introduced in

diflterent parts of the " Bearing Grit," in the 37-fathom level. As these became
more numerous, and of greater thickness, the vein began to throw off"

branches on either side, and in the course of a few fathoms there was not a
trace of the vein to be seen. As the upper and lower levels (the 20 and
50) approached the same perpendicular point eastward, the vein in each case
ramified into numerous strings. First, one branch was followed, and then

another, until they disappeared entirely. At about 60 fathoms eastwards
from where all trace of this vein was thus lost, a " Crosscut " (that is, a level at

right angles to the general bearing of the veins) was driven to some consi-

derable distance both North and South of where it should have been inter-
sected, had it continued eastward ; but without discovering the slightest
symptom of a vein.

The Rake Veins are generally found to be " Fault Veins." As a rule, the

strata are lower on that side to which a vein hades or inclines, called the

hanging wall, than on the one upon which it rests, known as the footwall

of the vein. Thus a vein with the beds on the north side thrown up, will

&hade or underlie to the south. (See figs. 4 5.)

The extent of the throw, or diff"erence of level of the correspondin;^

strata, varies from a few inches to 20 or 30 fathoms ; and such a difierence

is often met with when veins are in the immediate vicinity of each other.

The extent of the throw is generally considered to denote the strength of
Athe vein.
            vein with a difference in the level of the strata of from 6 to

18 feet, is regarded by the miner with more favour than one with a greater

or less throw. Such a throw is considered evidence of sufiicient strength of

vein to ensure its continuity at a moderate size, and not such as to destroy

the effect which certain beds are supposed to produce, when they are found

in the same horizontal line, on each side of the vein.

When rocks of a different character are brought into the same horizontal

1858.                                                   N
170 REPORT 1858.

line, that is, when Gritstone on one side of the vein is opposed to Plate on
the other, and Limestone to Gritstone, or Limestone to Shale, the veins are
not often found productive of Lead ores. There are, however, many ex-
ceptions to this rule. At the Grassington Mines are two parallel veins,
within 80 fathoms of each other, both throwing the south side down to such

an extent, as to cause Plate to be opposed to Gritstone, Plate to Limestone,
and Gritstone to Limestone, and so on throughout the whole depth explored
on them. (See fig. 5.) So circumstanced, one of these veins yielded great
abundance of ore, while the other proved to be totally barren.

  We often find, when the vein occasions a throw of some two or three

fathoms, that the ore does not extend above the change of strata on the
hanging side, nor below the change on the lying or footwall ; for instance,

when the bed of Grit or Limestone is 10 fathoms thick, and the throw of

the strata is 3 fathoms, Ave have only 7 fathoms in height of ore; but in
some cases the ore is found to extend the full thickness of the bed with the
addition of the extent of the throw. Diagram 4 represents a transverse sec-
tion of such a vein in the Grassington Mines, from which considerable quan-

tities of ore are now being raised.
   The strata on each side of a vein are not only at different levels, but near

the vein they have a different position, being bent upwards on the one side

and downwards on the other. As a rule, the strata on the higher side are
bent downwards to the vein, and on the depressed side from it. Thus, if

iu driving a crosscut southward, in search of a vein ranging east and west,

we arrive at a point where the beds assume a faster dip, our approach to a
vein that throws the strata down on the south side, is inferred ; while, if in
driving northward, the beds curve quickly upwards, we anticipate a vein

with the north-side strata at a higher level. (See fig. 5.)
    In each of our Lead-bearing districts, the strata consist of numerous

alternating beds of Plate, Gritstone, and Limestone ; forming the Yoredale
Rocks of Professor Phillips.

    The veins are found to traverse or pass through all these beds, but gene-
rally speaking, it is only in certain of them tiiat Lead ore is found ; the
Limestone being the prevalently productive stratum in some districts, whilst
in others the principal yield of ore is from the Gritstone. The Argillaceous

Plates seldom yield ore; but there is an exception to this in the Cononley
Mines, where bunches of ore have continued from the surface, to a depth
of more than 30 fathoms ; although the alternations of Plates and Gritstones

are exceedingly numerous, and the Plates much thicker than the Gritstone

beds.

    From these facts it follows, that a rule, by which to calculate on metallic
products from certain rocks, will not admit of general application ; but we

 raay carry it so far as to say, that in a given district, certain beds generally
are, and others generally are not, productive.

    Many veins, particularly in our more Northern fields, preserve a tolerably
 direct course for a considerable distance. The Old Gang Vein in Swaledale,

 for instance, has been worked for several miles in length, and can be traced

--to a much greater distance in nearly a straight line.
    In our three Northern Mining Fields, Swaledale, Arkendale, and Wens-

--leydale the veins appear to be more regular in size and direction, and the

 beds preserve a more uniform thickness, than in the three Southern Fields.
 In the former, likewise, the calcareous beds have been the principal sources
 of produce ; whereas, in our Southern ones, the greater portion of the ore
 has been, and still is being produced, from the Gritstone.

    There are other causes by which the productiveness of the veins appear
          ON THE LEAD MINING DISTRICTS OF YORKSHIRE.  l7l

to be influenced, that are peculiar to the Mines of our three Northern Dales,

while certain characteristics more particularly pertain to our Southern Mi-

Wening Fields.  may, therefore, for all the purposes of this paper, treat the

Lead Mines of this county, as belonging to two great Mineral Districts, the

Northern and the Southern.

   In each district we have the Rake, the Pipe, and the Flat Veins. The

ores from the Pipe and Flat Veins are generally found more fusible in the
furnace, and to yield a higher per centage of lead, tiian those from the Rake

Veins ; and the ores from the Limestones (whether produced from the

Rake, Pipe, or Fiat Vein) are found to be more easily reduced, and to make
a much better quality of metal for White Lead, than those from the Grit-

stone.

Here, I would refer to a correspondence, which took place some few

months ago, in the columns of the ' Mining Journal,' on the subject of Slick-

ensides. It was there asserted that Slickensides had never been met with

in Gritstone. I am prepared to meet this assertion, by the production of

the specimen obtained from the Gritstone in the Grassington Mines ; and

with the exception of one from the same place, which I gave to the late

Duke of Devonshire, I much question there being a better specimen in the

country.

The Slickensides first appeared at the point of junction of two veins, and

continued their course in a perfectly straight line in the centre of the joint

vein, for about 70 yards in length ; or they might perhaps more correctly be

said to have still divided the two veins, forming the North side of the one,

and the South side of the other. (See fig. 7.)

  We could have procured specimens from either side, with as good a sur-

face as the one exhibited, but not so large. It was only from the South

side that they could be obtained of any size, the other being so cracked

horizontally, that it was seldom a piece could be broken off, more than

an inch or two wide ; in fact, the cracks on this side were almost as nume«
rous as the strias on the surface of the North.

The vein, throughout the whole length in which the Slickensides were

found, maintained nearly a perpendicular position ; and the striae were as

nearly horizontal. In many parts of the vein, we had the thickness of a foot

of solid ore behind each face of Slickenside.

   Many present will no doubt have read or heard of the phenomena reported

to have attended the laying open of Slickensides in Germany ; that the
miner has at times been much frightened by the loud reports occasioned

by the explosions.

   When driving our level in the Slickensides, we generally worked forward

on the North side, leaving the South, or strong side, standing for 6 or 8 yards

in length ; and on more than one occasion, the wqrkmen spoke of the reports
they heard, sometimes as loud as that of a small pistol. At such times,

numerous places could be seen where pieces had been blistered, and blown

away from the face of the Slickenside; which presented much the same ap-

pearance as a wall recently plastered with very imperfectly-slacked lime, but

on a much larger scale.
   The ore from a vein carrying much Slickenside, requires generally a

higher temperature, and is altogether more refractory in the furnace than

that from one free from it.

   As a general rule, the greatest number of veins in each Mining district

are found to run nearly parallel to each other. There are others that form
angles more or less acute, with the predominant direction; which, in the

Northern District, is a little North of East, and South of West; whilst in

                                                                      n2
--172 REPORT 1858.

our Southern Fields, the general direction is North of West, and South of

East.

Where the veins of the more usual line of direction are crossed by

oblique or " caunter " veins, we frequently find the traversed ones to be shifted

or thrown off their course, and often ramified by those so traversing ; and

sometimes they undergo a curvature on one side, near the cross vein.

As a rule, if the oblique or " caunter" vein be first met with on the right-

hand side, the shift will be to the left ; and if on tlie contrary, the heave

will be to the right ; or in other words, the vein is heaved on the side of the

obtuse angle formed by the intersecting planes. (See fig. 8 ; A, B, A.)

To this rule there are however many exceptions, and a remarkable one

occurred at tlie Grassington Mines, which is represented by Fig. 8. On

A Afinding the vein  shitted, the level, as usual, was turned on the side of the

obtuse angle, and driven forward on the vein B some considerable distance,

till, despairing of finding the vein in this direction, and after carefully exami-

ning the surface, and some old works in the vicinity, we returned to the point

of intersection, and began a level northward at nearly right angles to the
traversed vein ; whicli in course of time was found to be heaved or thrown

A Abackwards some 50 yards. (See fig. 8 ; A, B B, A.)

    In heaves of this class, the veins are consequently lengthened ; while they

are shortened when thrown or shifted on the side of the obtuse angle.

The dislocation of one vein by another is likewise indicative of its ante-

rior existence.

   When one or both of the veins produce ore up to the point at which they

meet, the yield is often increased by their junction. The extent of the angle
formed by two veins is looked upon with some interest by the Miner; the
more acute it is, the more favourable is their union considered to be for the

production of metallic Mineral.

   At Grassington, it is found that many of the direct veins are not heaved
by the oblique or " caunter " ones, but are so split or ramified, that it is with
difficulty they can be traced on the other side of the intersection. The
usual course in such cases is to go forward on the"caunter" vein, some fathoms
beyond the point of intersection, and drive a crosscut ; when the branches

are often found to have united, and the vein to be reconstructed.

   When the displacement of the strata is so gi'eat as to cause beds of dif-

ferent mineral character to be opposed to each other, fragments of the en-

closing rocks form a considerable portion of the contents of the vein.
   The general composition of the veins is Calcareous Spar, Fluor Spar,

Barytes, and occasionally Calamine. In some districts one of these minerals

prevails, in others another.

  A vein enclosed by regularly stratified Gritstone is productive, almost

entirely, of Galena, which forms the principal yield of Lead Ores through-

out the world. Cases have, however, occurred, when a somewhat thin stra-
tum of Grit, superimposed on an Argillaceous Shale of moderate thickness,

has exclusively contained large quantities of decomposing Galena, earthy
Carbonates, and imperfectly crystallized Carbonates. In the former case, the
ore lies mostly in more or less solid ribs, approximately parallel to the walls

of the vein ; while in the latter, the lode is found loosely filled with various

sized pieces, in different stages of chemical decomposition.

   When the beds of Gritstone and Shale are much broken and displaced

(as is usual in the vicinity of an anticlinal axis, or contiguous to a line of

extensive fault), or when the beds of Shale are individually thicker than the

respective Gritstones, the vein throughout its productive depth principally

yields irregular strings and small bunches of Galena ; whilst its upper part
ON THE LEAD MINING DISTRICTS OF YOUKSHIRE. 173

mostly carries considerable deposits, of mixed rich and poor earthy, compact,

and crystallized Carbonates.

In such ground, when the vein is very wide and encloses detached masses

of Gritstone, or when the sides of the lode are much disturbed and broken,

large crystals of the Carbonate are frequently found pressed flat upon the

faces formed by the jointing and bedding planes of such Sandstone, for

some distance from the body of the ore.

The Limestone beds usually favour the deposits of rich Galena in self

lumps, or nodules of various sizes. These self lumps are often coated with

an earthy white Carbonate, which is also frequently found filling the small

interstices in the adjacent rock, and likewise as a deposit in the nests formed

by those sudden enlargements and contractions so usual in veins traversing

the Limestone beds. Not many of the other Lead Ores (which are seldom

met with, and consequently of little commercial value) have been found in

our Yorkshire Mines.

Minium is stated, in most Mineralogical works, to have been found on

Grassington Moor ; but I have never seen, nor heard of any from there,

and certainly for twenty-six years past none has been found. The Phos-

phate and Arsenio-phosphate were formerly found at Grassington, principally

in the Gritstone.

  A small piece of native Lead has also been obtained from the Gritstone

in those mines within the last four years.

   In each district we have numerous mines ; some, that a few years ago
were highly productive, are now nearly exhausted ; others, though but
recently opened, are yielding well; and there is no doubt there are many rich

veins yet undiscovered in both districts.

   By far the greater portion of the present produce from the Northern dis-
trict is from the Old Gang Mine, in Arkendale ; and the Kell Head Mine,

in Wensleydale ; while the Grassington Mines in Wharfedale yield about

two-thirds of the produce of the Southern district. The produce of the

county in 1856 was 8933 tons of Pig Lead, or about |th of the total returns
of the United Kingdom.

The difficulties and uncertainties which attend mining for Metallic Mine-

rals are not generally known.

   Many large and regular veins (although presenting very encouraging fea-
tures) prove totally destitute of metallic mineral; others make rich deposits

of ore, but of very limited extent; and in our most profitable mines, a con-
siderable extent of barren ground must needs be opened, even on the best
producing veins.

At the Cononley Mines, for instance, although profitable for many years

past, the levels (which are very extensive) have laid open more than 20

fathoms of totally unmetalliferous, for every fathom of productive ground.

The Sections produced tend to show that Lead Mining in the secondary

formation is more uncertain in its character than in the more primitive

Whenrocks.  ore is discovered in the latter, it is reasonably expected to

continue upwards and downwards to some considerable extent ; whereas, in a

stratified country, and where the bearing beds are not individually thick, the

ore at best will not exceed a few fathoms in height or depth, and moreover

levels may be driven in certain beds without the slightest chance of success.

In one respect the stratified district offers the advantage. The nature

and thickness of the bearing beds, and the inclination of the strata being

known, we can generally determine the elevation for commencing an Adit,

or water level, to drain the productive parts of the veins ; and thus avoid

the cost of engine power for pumping, and other expenses.
174 REPORT 1858.

   Mining for Metallic Minerals, whether in the primitive or secondary for-

mation, is of a much more uncertain and speculative character than that for
Coal. In the Coal Measures, we can ascertain at a moderate expense, by

boring, whether seams of Coal exist ; and if existing, their thickness. This
being learnt, an approximate estimate of the quantity of saleable Coal in a
given area, and the cost of its get, is no difficult matter.

   With the Rake and Pipe Veins of the Lead Fields, the case is different.

A vein which generally approaches the perpendicular, rather than otherwise,

presents little chance of being probed by boring ; and even should it be
pierced, the mineral capable of extraction through a borehole would afford
very unsafe data by which to judge the value of the vein. The hole might

quite possibly pass through the only portion of ore contained within many

fathoms ; or, with an equal possibility, penetrate the poor part of a vein,
which at any other point would have yielded widely different data.

   Mineral veins may be, and frequently are, discovered (in places where the

surface of the rock is to be seen) by the fracture and interruption in the

regularity of the strata.

   In all Mining districts, but especially in a stratified country, the pheno-
mena presented by veins, their frequent heaves and dislocations, and their
varied appearances when bounded by different rocks, call for very close
attention ; and even a dependence upon knowledge acquired in one district,

may prove fatal in another.
   The Miner should be perfectly acquainted with the nature of those sub-

--stances, which it is his daily task to seek in the bowels of the earth, as

well as with those which, though perhaps worthless in themselves, generally
indicate the presence or absence of the immediate objects of his search.

Long and practical experience, combined with a knowledge of Geology
and PJineralogy, can alone furnish him with this requisition ; and is there-

fore essential to success.

               On the Collapse of Glass Globes and Cylinders.

                         By W. Fairbairn, F.R.S.

At the Meeting of the British Association last year, a paper was read upon

the Collapse of Cylindrical Wrought-iron Riveted Tubes by a uniform
external force. These experiments upon a ductile and fibrous material, led
to some novel, and important results, and suggested the propriety of similarly
testing the resisting powei-s of a perfectly homogeneous crystalline and
rigid material, in order that our knowledge of the laws which govern the
resistance of vessels to collapse, might be confirmed and extended.

    For tfiis purpose, glass was the material selected, not only on account of
its fulfilling better than almost any other material the conditions sought for,
and from the ease with which it could be manufactured into the required
forms ; but also because it was hoped that the results would be practically of
value in those cases in the arts and in experimental science in which it is so
 extensively employed.

   mThe experiments were conducted a similar manner to those upon iron.

 Some glass cylinders and globes were procured direct from the glass-house,
 blown out of good flint-glass. The open ends of these were then hermetically

 sealed by the blow-pipe, and they were placed in a strong wrought-iron vessel,
 capable of sustaining a pressure of 2500 lbs. per square inch. Water was
 then pumped in by means of a force-pump, and the pressure was recorded
       ON THE COLLAPSE OP GLASa GLOBES AND CYLINDERS. 175

by a SchsefFer gauge. The point of rupture was indicated by an explosion
within the vessel, and by the sudden decrease of pressure.

   The first experiments were upon glass globes, intended to be perfectly
spherical, but in most instances somewhat flattened upon the side opposite

to that from which they were blown. Notwithstanding, however, this ellip-

ticity, some of the globes bore enormously high pressures, especially when
the extreme tenuity of the glass is considered, amounting to from one to

two hundredths of an inch in thickness only.

   The general formula for the globes takes the form of the following equa-

tion,

                                        p-- Cx<f

P being the collapsing pressure in lbs. per square inch; D=diameter;
<= thickness of glass. Similarly, putting L=length, the formula for the

cylinders is

                                   p_Cx^l
                                         DxL'

which is precisely similar to that for iron tubes.

Report on the Marine Fauna of the South and West Coasts of Ireland.

   By E. Perceval Wright, M.B., A.B., F.L.S., M.R.I.A., Di-

    rector of the Museum, and Lecturer on Zoology, University of

   Dublin ; and J. Reay Greene, A.B., M.R.I.A., Professor of

    Natural History, Queen's College, Cork. Part I. (1858).

At the last Meeting of the British Association, a Committee consisting of

 Drs. E. Perceval Wright, Melville, and Kinahan, was appointed to investigate
 the marine Zoology of the south and west Coasts of Ireland.

    Professor J. Reay Greene and Dr. Carte of Dublin were subsequently
added to the Committee.

    The region marked out for their observations extends from Carnsore Point
 in the Co. of Wexford, to Gweedore Bay in the Co. Donegal, and embraces a
 coast line of several hundreds of miles. It was evident that so vast a district
 could only be investigated by the labours of several years, and hence, on
 mature deliberation, the Committee determined to devote themselves and
 the money grant placed at their disposal by the Council for 1858, to in-
 vestigate parts of the Cos. Waterford, Cork, and Kerry ; reserving the Coasts
 of Clare and Galway for the next ensuing summer, and those of Mayo,
 Sligo, and Donegal for another year ; hoping, at the expiration of this period,
 to be able to communicate to the British Association a Report, which, with
 the joint Reports from the North of Ireland and Dublin Bay Dredging Com-
  mittee, will enable us to draw up a final Report on the Irish Marine Fauna,

  which shall be entitled to act a second part to that by the late Professor E.

 Forbes " On the investigation of the British Marine Fauna," published in

  1850.

     Such being our intention, we wish it to be understood that the present
  Report is merely provisional, and that we refrain from deducing any theories
  from the facts observed, until we have the entire district examined.

     Early in July 1858, we proceeded to investigate the first selected region,
  and a list of the stations from which the coast at each side was explored is
  given, i. e. 1. Carnsore Point; 2. Saltees; 3. Hook Head; 4. Dunmore
  5. Tramore; 6. Youghal ; 7. Cork Harbour; 8. Kinsale; 9. Rosscarberry
  10. Castletownsend ; 11. Baltimore ; 12. Cape Clear Island; 13. Skull;
  14'. Crookhaven ; 15. Glengariif; 16. Berehaven ; 17. Ardgroom ; 18. Ca-

  hersiveen ; 19. Valentia; 20. Dingle; 21. Ventry; 22. the 131asquet Islands.
      Several portions of this district had from time to time been investigated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          :

MARINE FAUNA OF THE S. AND W. COASTS OP IRELAND. 177

by various Irish naturalists, and previous to setting out on our explorations,

we carefully noted the result of their labours, in order that we might corro-

borate all doubtful localities given by them, and also have the benefit of their

past experience; the localities so investigated, were Youghal by the late Dr.
Ball, Cork Harbour by J. Vaughan Thompson and others, Courtmacsherry

and Bantry Bays by Professor Alhnan, Dingle Bay by W. Andrews, and

Valentia by Professor Kinahan.

   Considering that we could not gain a correct knowledge of the Fauna
without devoting a good deal of attention to " shore collecting," we took

frequent occasion, at the period of low tides, to investigate the littoral zone

and to this fact may be ascribed the discovery of a large number of new
Irish Zoantharia, and many interesting Nudibranch Mollusca.

  The geologic structure of the coast, for the most part Devonian and Silurian,

is such, that " shore collecting " cannot be prosecuted unless with the assist-

ance of boats : as sheer precipices, often hundreds of feet high and rising

perpendicularly out of the water, quite preclude access to the very fertile

fields of marine zoology which may be found in the tide-worn caverns at

their base.

In many places, too, small rocky islets, covered at every successive tide,

were proved well worthy of diligent search.

While we paid a good deal of attention to this latter kind of investigation,

we yet did not neglect the as important one of" dredging," The smallness of

our grant, added to the extreme expense which would attend on deep-sea

dredging in such remote parts of Ireland, prevented us from exploring any

depth beyond thirty or forty fathoms. We, however, hope on a future occasion

to be enabled to undertake a series of deep-sea dredgings on the west coast,

by the kind assistance of some yachting friends.

   The commonest sea bottom we met with, was one formed of a coarse
sand, chiefly made up of the debris of decaying Nullipore and broken frag-

ments of Trophon, Natica, Rissoa, Odostomia, &c. This sand particularly
abounds in Bantry Bay ; it is most extensively used for fertilizing the land,

being dredged for this purpose in enormous quantities. Marine animals
seem to avoid this " Coral sand," and with the exception of Hippolyte va-

rians, even the ' Shrimps ' appeared to us to abandon it. Next, we met with

vast tracks of heavy compact sand, chiefly tenanted by the Crangonidse and

Palaemonidse, diversified here and there with large patches of weedy ground

which abounded with animal life.

Many of the large harbours were very muddy, and abounded with sponges,

&c., which sometimes reached gigantic dimensions.

 --The Cape Clear Island, the most southern, and the Blasquet Islands, the

most western land in Ireland, with Bere Island, were carefully examined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

their sides present such high and unbroken walls to the ocean, and they are

so exposed to its continual swell, that they were not found particularly pro-

ductive.

   To enumerate in detail the various species of the marine Fauna met with,
would be at the present immature. But we would wish to call attention to

some interesting forms that presented themselves, and append a list of the
Zoantharia and Echinodermata as specimens of the richness of the Fauna.

   On quiet days, when the Atlantic was moderately calm, nothing could

--exceed in beauty and numbers the Medusee fleets of iEquorea sailed past,

accompanied by Thaumantias glohosa, Thompsoni, conjluens, and many

others ; this last-mentioned species, discovered by the late Professor Edward

Forbes, is remarkable for the peculiar arrangement of its reproductive glands,
which are placed so high up in the gastro-vascular canals, as to present the

appearance of a bright red cross, shining conspicuously through the trans-

parent disk, when tlie animal is seen floating beneath the surfiace of the

water.

   New forms of Slabberia, Oceania, &c., occurred in the western entrance of

Berehaven, as also many specimens of Willsia stellata.

   Except for their abundance, the following Ctenophora would hardly merit

notice, viz. Cydippc pileus and pomiformis, Mnemea Norvegica, and Beroe
ovata. This latter swam in shoals ; several of the specimens being of a

very large size and of a bright roseate hue, frequently diversified with a

play of iridescent colours. In Berehaven Harbour we also obtained an

apparently new species of Tomopteris ; its otherwise transparent body glittered
with many bright sherry-coloured spots, and we were enabled to investigate

with some care tlie anatomy of this very anomalous creature.
   The List of Zoantharia appended (List B) will show the species that

occurred. In some parts of the coast, as off Croolihaven and Dingle, the whole
surface of the rocks for many square yards was covered with specimens of
Corynactis viridis, so far belying its specific name as to appear of the most
brilliant purple, as often as of a bright green, varied with many of a rich

peach colour. Every excavation that the waves had worn in tlie slaty

Devonian, was inhabited by Sagartia veniista, S. rosea, and others of the genus;

and we observed that at Parkmore Point, near Venty, Tiibularia indivisa

abounded in such quantities, that in one place a piece of rock about 20 feet

long by 10 or so broad, and covered by 1 or 2 feet of water, was one dense

forest of this interesting Hydrozoon; others of this latter division were ob-

served, but details thereof are reserved for a future occasion.

   Among the Echinodermata, we may mention that Uraster glacialis occurred

very commonly, and several specimens were dredged, which measured 32

inches in diameter ; Luidia fragillissima and Asterias aurantiaca were not

unfrequent. Amphidotiis roseus occurred in Bantry Bay. From the list

appended, it will be seen tliat nearly all the Asteriadse, with but few ex-

ceptions, have been obtained on tiie coast of Ireland.

Crihella rosea and Goniaster Templetoni have been taken by Dr. Ball on

the Nymph Bank oft' Waterford, and at Youghal. Several new species also

Weoccurred to us.  think we have discovered the " first appearing " on the

south coast of the Echinus lividics, on some sunken rocks out at sea ; and it

appears to us that a curious relation exists between the vertical and geogra-

phical distribution of the species in question, since the higher the latitude

in which it is found, tlie shallower the water it would appear to frequent.

We have been led to this conclusion from observations made by us on its

occurrence around the west and south coasts of Ireland. At Dingle, for

example, it lives and thrives high up in the Littoral Zone; whereas about

the Cape Clear district, it loves the deep rock pools, where it is only exposed

to view at the very lowest tides, and even then with from 10 to 15 ieet of

water always over it. The rare Echinus Flemingii has been taken by Dr.

Ball at Youghal. (See List A.)

   Of the Crustacea a long list could be furnished, but we would only allude

to the capture of the various species of Ebalia on sandy ground in Castle-

townsend and Berehaven ; of Xantho rivulosa at Valentia, where it was

taken in 1856 by Dr. Kinahan ; and Pirimela denticulata in Dingle by Wm.

Andrews, Esq. Galathea Andreivsii, a species recently added to science by

Dr. Kinahan, was dredged in the greatest abundance.

   Of the MoUusca little mention need be made, Doris fiammea, coccinea,

the two Hermceas recorded in Alder and Hancock, Eolis Farrani, &c.
were found, the latter three very abundantly ; a large number of Tunicata
MARINE FAUNA OP THE S. AND W. COASTS OP IRELAND. l79

awarded our diligent search with several probably new species. Calyptrcea
sinensis and lanthina communis may be alluded to among the Gastero-
pods, with Amphysphyra hyalina, Tornatella fasciata, Philine quadrata, &c.
Aplysia hybrida might be seen browsing in herds on the Codium tomento-
sum, which at Berehaven grows most luxuriantly. Area tetragona occurred
at Ardgroom, Venus casina, &c. with Pectunculus glycimeris, in Bantry Bay.

   Amphioxus lanceolatus was taken in Berehaven, one specimen of which
survived its capture for many days, despite of being carried in a glass vessel
nearly 200 miles. William Andrews records the following rare fish as oc-
curring off Dingle : Capros aper, Sebastes Norvegicus, Cottus Grcenlandicus,
Morrhtia minuta, and Raniceps trifurcatus ; both Lepidogaster cornubiensis
and bimaculatus were taken by us at the shore of Cape Clear Island.

   In conclusion, we would ask for a renewal of the grant for the year 1859

from the Council, trusting to continue our exploration of this interesting
region with unabated zeal, and with a sure confidence that the result of
our labour will prove of some service to those who, like us, are engaged

in the pleasant task of observing and recording the many created beings,

which, nurtured and preserved in life by the great world of waters alike with
it, proclaims the existence of an Almighty and Omnipotent God.

   Total number of species of Echinoderms 35, or about two-thirds of the
British list ; and of the Zoantharia 27, or about half the number recorded as
occurring in England and Scotland. This difference will, we trust, be greatly-
diminished in a few years. Both lists have been brought down to the latest
dates, several species having been added while the MS. was passing through

the press.

   The districts marked from 1 to 7, are given as first introduced by one of
the authors in the " Proceedings of the Dublin University Zoological and

--Botanical Association," vol. i. p. 176, and are briefly as follows :
   1st Province, North. From Tory Island or Horn Head, on the mainland,

to Rathlin Island or Fair Head, embracing the two extensive Loughs,
Swilly and Foyle, and parts of the counties of Donegal, Londonderry, and

--Antrim.
   2nd Province, North-East. From Fair Head to Downpatrick, at the en-
trance of Strangford Lough, embracing Belfast and Strangford Loughs, and
parts of Antrim and Down.

  --3rd Province, East. From Downpatrick to Carnsore Point, in the county

of Wexford, embracing Dundrum, Dundalk, and Dublin Bays, and parts of

--the counties of Down, Louth, Meath, Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford.
   ith Province, South. From Carnsore Point to Cape Clear, county of
          EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEASUREMENT OP WATER. 181

Cork, with the fine harbours of Waterford, Dungarven, Youghal, Cork, and
Kinsale, and parts of the counties of Wexford, Waterford, and Cork.

 --5th Province, South-West. From Mizen Head to Kerry Head, or the

mouth of the Shannon, embracing Bantry, Dingle, and Tralee Bays, the
Kenmare River, and parts of the counties of Cork and Kerry.

   6th Province, West From Loop Head, county of Clare, to Erris Head,
on Mullet Island, at the extreme north-west of Mayo, embracing Galway,
Clare, and Blacksod Bays, the Isles of Arran, Clare, Achill, and Mullet, and

--parts of the counties of Clare, Galway, and Mayo.
   7th Province, North-west. From Erris Head to Horn Head, embracing
Killala, Sligo, and Donegal Bays, and parts of the counties of Mayo, Sligo,

and Donegal.
    "These seven Provinces might be easily subdivided, but I think this is not

advisable ; indeed, I am rather doubtful of the propriety of keeping either
the 2nd or 5th Province : but still we find species peculiar to each of these

localities, or at least occurring in them, and not generally found in the others :
thus. Echinus lividus occurs in Province 5, but hardly, if at all, in Province 4.
I need hardly justify the utility of making these Provinces ; their convenience,
when referring to geographical distribution, is obvious ; as by saying in which

of these Provinces an animal occurs, we at once arrive at an idea of its dis-
tribution in a much shorter manner than enumerating the counties it occurs

in. I have hesitated to call the Provinces Boreal, Lusitanian, &c., thinking

the time has not yet arrived for so doing. The Dredging Committees on

the east, north, and south-west of Ireland will doubtless in time enable this

to be done. I have only to hope this enumeration may be adopted, as it

will render comparison so very easy."

On Experiments on the Measurement of Water by Triangular Notches
   in Weir Boards. By James Thomson, A.M., C.E., Professor of

     Civil Engineering, Queen's College, Belfast.

The experiments proposed to be comprehended in the investigations to

which the present interim Report relates, have for their object to determine
the suitableness of triangular (or V-shaped) notches in vertical plates for
the gauging of running water, instead of the rectangular notches in ordinary

use. The ordinary rectangular notches, accurately experimented on as they

have been, at great cost and with high scientific skill, in various countries,
with the view of determining the necessary formulas and coefficients, for

their application in practice, are for many purposes suitable and convenient.
They are, however, but ill adapted for the measurement of very variable
quantities of water, such as commonly occur to the engineer to be gauged
in rivers and streams. If the rectangular notch is to be made wide enough

 to allow the water to pass in flood times, it must be so wide, that for long
 periods in moderately dry weather, the water flows so shallow over its crest

 that its indications cannot be relied on. To remove, in some degree, this

 objection, gauges for rivers or streams are sometimes formed in the best

 engineering practice, with a small rectangular notch cut down below the

 general level of the crest of a large rectangular notch. If, now, instead of

 one depression being made for dry-weather use, in a crest wide enough for
 use in floods, we conceive of a large number of depressions extending so as
 to give to the crest the appearance of a set of steps of stairs, and if we
--l82 REPORT 1858.

conceive the number of such steps to become infinitely great, we are led at

once to the conception of the triangular, instead of the rectangular notch.

The principle of the triangular notch being tiius arrived at, it becomes

evident that there is no necessity for having one side of the notch vertical

and the otlier slanting; but that, as may in many cases prove more con-
venient, both sides may be made slanting, and their slopes may be alike. It

is then to be observed, that by the use of the triangular notch with proper
formulas and coefficients derivable by due union of theory and experiments,

quantities of running water, from the smallest to the greatest, may be accu-
rately gauged by their flow through the same notch. The reason of this is
obvious, from considering that in the triangular notch, when the quantity

flowing is very small, the flow is confined to a small space admitting of

accurate measurement ; and that the space for the flow of water increases as
the quantity to be measured increases, but still continues such as to admit

of accurate measurement.

   Further, the ordinary rectangular notch, when applied for the gauging of

rivers, is subject to a serious objection from the difficulty, or impossibility,
of properly taking into account the influence of tiie bottom of the river on

the flow of the water to the notch. If it were practicable to dam up the

river so deep that the water would flow tiirough the notch as if coming from
a reservoir of still water, the difficulty would not arise. This, however, can
seldom be done in practice ; and althou" h the bottom of the river may be so
far below the crest as to produce but little effect on tlie flow of the water
when the quantity flowing is small, yet when the quantity becomes great,
the " Velocity of Approach" comes to have a very material influence on the
flow of the water, but an influence which it is usually difficult, if not im-

practicable, to ascertain with satisfactory accuracy. In the notches now
proposed, of triangular form, the influence of the bottom may be rendered
definite, and such as to aff'ect alike (or at least by some law that may be
readily determined by experiments) the flow of the water when very small,
or when very great, in the same notch. The method by which I propose
that this may be eft'ected, consists in carrying out a floor starting exactly

from the vertex of the notch, and extending both up stream and laterally so
as to form a bottom to the channel of approach, which will both be smooth,
and will serve as the lower bounding surface of a passage of approach un-
chan"-ing in form while increasing in magnitude at the places at least which

are adjacent to the vertex of the notch. The floor may either be perfectly
level, or may consist of two planes wiiose intersection would start from the

vertex of the notch, and, as seen in plan, would pass up stream perpendicularly
to the direction of the weir board, the two planes slanting upwards from
their intersection more gently than the sides of the notch. The level floor,
although theoretically not quite so perfect as the floor of two planes, would
probably, for most practical purposes, prove the more convenient arrangement.
With reference to the use of the floor, it may be said, in short, that by a due
arrangement of the notch and the floor, a discharge orifice and channel of
approach may be produced, of which (the upper surface of the water being
considered as the top of the channel and orifice) the form will be unchanged

--or but little changed, with variations of the quantity flowing; very much

less certainly than is the case with rectangular notches.

   The laws regulating the quantities of water flowing in such orifices as
have now been described, come naturally next to be considered. Without,

however, in the present interim Report, attempting to enter on a detailed
discussion of theoretical considerations on this subject, I shall here merely

advert briefly to the principal results and methods of reasoning.

           EXPERIMENTS ON THE MEASUREMENT OF WATER. 183

   By theory I have been led to anticipate that the quantity flowing in a
given notch should be proportional, or very nearly so, to the f power of the

lineal dimensions of the cross section of the issuing jet, or to the |- power of
the head of water over the vertex of the notch. This head is to be under-
stood, in the case of water flowing from a still reservoir, as being measured
vertically from the level of the water surface down to the vertex of the
notch ; or, in the case of water flowing to the notch, with a considerable
velocity of approach over a floor arranged as above prescribed, the head is
to be considered as being measured vertically from the water surface where
the motion is nearly stopped by the weir board, at a place near the board,

but as far as may be found practicable from the centre of the notch. The

law here enunciated, to the effect that the quantity flowing should be pro-

portional to the ^ power of the head, I consider should hold good rigidly in
reference to water flowing by a triangular notch in a thin vertical plate from
a large and deep reservoir of still water, if the water were a perfect fluid,
free from viscidity and friction, and free from capillary attiaction at its
surface, and from any other slight disturbing causes that may have minute
influences on the flow, the flow being supposed to be that due simply to
gravitation resisted by the inertia of the fluid. The like may be said of

water flowing I'rom triangular notches with shallow channels of approach,

having floors as described above, when due attention is given to make the
passages of approach so as really to remain unchanged in form for a suffi-

cient distance from the notch, while increasing in magnitude as the flow in-

creases (such being supposed, according to my theory, to be possible) ; and

if due attention be paid to measuring the heads in all cases in positions
similarly situated with reference to the varying dimensions of the issuing

streams.

    In illustration of these statements, or suppositions, I would merely say that
if two triangular notches, similar in form, have water flowing in them at
different depths but with similar passages of approach, the cross sections of

the two jets at the notches may be similarly divided into the same number of

elements of area ; and that the areas of the corresponding elements will be
proportional to the squares of the lineal dimensions of the cross sections, or,

as from various considerations may readily be assumed, proportional to the

squares of the heads; also the velocities of the water in the corresponding

elements may be taken as proportional to the square roots of the lineal
dimensions, or to the square roots of the heads. From these considerations,

supported by numerous others, it appears that the quantities flowing should
be proportional to the products of the squares of the heads into their square
roots, or to the ^ powers, as already stated.

   The friction of the fluid on the solid bounding surfaces of the passages of
approach where the water moves rapidly adjacent to the notch, may readily

be assumed, from all previous experience in similar subjects, not to have a
very important influence even on the absolute amount of the flow of the

water ; and if we assume (as is known to be nearly the case for high velo-

cities, such as occur in notches used for practical purposes, unless unusually
small) that the tangential force of friction of the fluid, per unit of area of
surface flowed along, is proportional to the square of the velocity of flow, it
follows by theory that the friction, although slightly influencing the absolute

amount of the flow, will not, according to that assumption, at all interfere
with its proportionality to the |- power of the head, and this condition will
very nearly hold good if the assumption is very nearly correct.

   How closely the theory thus briefly sketched may be found to agree with

the actual flow of water will be a subject for experimental investigation
--184 REPORT 1858.

and whatever may be the result in this respect, the main object must be to
obtain, for a moderate number of triangular notches of different forms, and

both with and without floors at the passage of approach, the necessary
coefficients for the various forms of notches and approaches selected, and
for various depths in any one of them, so as to allow of water being gauged
for practical purposes, when in future convenient, by means of similarly-
formed notches and approaches. The utility of the proposed system of
gauging, it is to be particularly observed, will not depend on a perfectly
close agreement of the theory described with the experiments, because in
respect to any given form of notch and approach, a table of experimental coeffi-
cients for various depths, or an empirical formula slightly modified from

the theoretical one, will serve all purposes. To one evident simplification

in the proposed system of gauging, as compared with that by rectangular
notches, I would here advert, namely, that in the proposed system, when
once the form of the notch and channel of approach is fixed for gauging
any set of streams, the quantity flowing comes to be treated as a function
of only one variable, namely, the measured head of water; while in the rect-
angular notches it is practically treated as a function of at least two variables,
namely, the head of water and the horizontal width of the notch ; because
in practice it would be inconvenient, if not impossible, to select any single
width of notch, or any moderate number of widths of notches, for general
use, for very varied quantities of water. It is commonly also a function of
a third variable, very difficult to be taken into account, namely, the depth
from the crest of the notch down to the bottom of the channel of approach ;
which depth must vary in its influence with all the varying ratios between it
and the other two quantities of which the flow is a function.

    The proposed system of gauging also gives facilities for taking another

element into account which often arises in practice; namely, the influence
of back water on the flow of the water in the gauge, when, as frequently

occurs in rivers, it is found impracticable to dam the river up sufficiently to

give it a clear overfall, free from the back or tail water. For any given
ratio of the height of the tail water above the vertex of the notch, to the
height of the head water above the vertex of the notch, I would anticipate
that the quantities flowing would still be, approximately at least, proportional
to the f-power of the head as before ; and a set of coefficients would have to
be determined experimentally for different ratios of the height of the head
water to the height of the tail water above the vertex of the notch.

   With the aid of the grant placed at my disposal by the Association at last

year's meeting, for the purposes of these researches, I have got an experi-
mental apparatus constructed and fitted up at a place a few miles distant

from Belfast, in Carr's Glen, on the grounds of Mr. Neeson, who has kindly
afforded me all the necessary facilities regarding the water supply and the site
for the experiments ; and I have got some preliminary experiments made on a
right-angled notch in a vertical plane surface, the sides of the notch making

angles of 45° with the horizon, and the flow being from a deep and wide
pool of quiet water, and the water thus approaching the notch uninfluenced

by any floor or bottom. The principal set of experiments as yet made were

on quantities of water varying from about 2 to 10 cubic feet per minute;
and the depths or heads of water varied from 2 to 4 inches in the right-

angled notch. From these experiments I derive the formula Q=*317 H^ ;

Q Hwhere is the quantity of water in cubic feet per minute, and the head

as measured, vertically, in inches, from the still-water level of the pool, down

to the vertex of the notch. This formula is submitted, at present tempo-
rarily, as being accurate enough for use for ordinary practical purposes for
       ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTS.                                                           185

the measurement of water by notches similar to the one experimented on,
and for quantities of water limited to nearly the same range as those in
the experiments; but as being, of course, subject to amendment by more
perfect experiments extending through a wider range of quantities of

water.

   Out of the grant of £10 from the Association for these experiments, the

amount for which I have hitherto had to apply to the Treasurer as having

been expended in them is £8 Os. 4cZ.; which leaves a balance remaining of
£1 I9s. 8d.

    It will be readily observed, that the experimental investigations indica-

ted in tlie foregoing report as desirable, are such as would require for their
completion, and extension to large flows of water, a greatexpenditure both of
time and money, like as has already been the case with researches on the flow
of water in rectangular notches. All that I can myself for the present pro-
pose to attempt, is to open up the subject with experiments on moderately
small flows of water ; and with this view, I would be glad to be aided, by a
further grant from the Association, in continuing experiments of the liinds

already undertaken.

 : Report of the Committee on the Magnetic Survey of Great Britain,

i : By Major-General Sabine.

The Committee are glad to be able to state that the Survey has made good

progress in the course of the present year. Mr. Welsh has completed tlie

Survey of Scotland and its adjacent islands, by adding observations at a suf-

ficient number of points on the islands to the north and west of the main

land to those he had made in Scotland itself in 1857. General Sabine has

employed himself in  North and  South Wales                                                  and Dr. Lloyd, having asso-
                                                                                          ;

ciated with himself Professors Joseph Galbraith and Samuel Haughton, and

George Johnstone Stoney, Esq., has obtained observations on the course of

the isoclinal and isodynamic lines over Ireland generally.

There is probably another year's work before the Survey will be so far

advanced that its difl'erent parts can be coordinated, preparatory to the final

account being prepared for presentation to the Association. In the mean

time Dr. Lloyd is desirous that the names of Messrs. Galbraith, Haughton,

and Stoney should be added to those of the Committee named in 1856.

Report on Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral Substances importedfrom

   Foreign Countries into the Clyde {including the Ports of Glasgoio,
   Greenock, and Port Glasgow) in the years 1853, 1854, 1855, 1856,

   1857. By Michael Connal, Esq., and William Keddie,

   Esq., Glasgow.

The following returns have been obtained from a careful examination of

the Clyde Bill of Entry, printed by the Custom House authorities at Glasgow.

The returns embrace only substances imported from foreign countries, ex-

clusive of those received " coastwise." From the vague and often inaccurate

manner in which the entries are made, it has been found impossible to classify

a number of the substances. Those of unknown or uncertain character have

been placed under the head of Miscellaneous.

Report of the Committee on Shipping Statistics. Presented to the
                        British Association, September, 1858.

Report of the Committee appointed by the British Association to inquire
into the statistics of shipping, with a view to rendering statistical record more

available as data conducive to the improvement of naval architecture as
respects the adaptation of the form of ships to the requirements of sea

service.

The Committee, so appointed, consisted of the following gentlemen :

Admiral Moorsom.                     Charles Atherton.                                                                                                                      Henry Wright.
                                     William Fairbairn.                                                                                                                     Andrew Henderson.
J. Scott Russell.
                                     James Perry.
J. E. McConnell.

   The Committee, on commencing their proceedings, received letters from
Admiral Moorsom, Mr. John Scott Russell, and Mr. J. E. McConnell,
whereby the Committee were deprived of the co-operation of those gentlemen
as members of this Committee ; the remaining members, however, agreed to

prosecute the duties assigned to them, and William Fairbairn, Esq., F.R.S.,
by the unanimous desire of the Committee, undertook to conduct the pro-
ceedings as Chairman, with the assistance of Henry Wright, Esq., as Honor-

ary Secretary. The Committee now beg to explain the course of proceed-

ing by which they hoped to promote, if not mature, the objects assigned to
them by the Association.

    In the first place, the Committee issued a circular, inviting statistical in-
formation as to the actual sea performances of ships (Appendix No. 1), with
a view to compiling a comprehensive statement as to the sea performances
of vessels generally, whence the Committee might be enabled to select a con-

siderable number of vessels, of which the performances at sea may have been
--240 REPORT 1858.

remarkable ; and their attention being thus directed to a limited selection,
embracing a considerable number of vessels of practically established excel-

lence for sea service, the Committee hoped, after making due inquiry, to be

enabled to present, as respects those vessels, a statistical exposition, in tabular

form, of their various elements of construction and type of build, and thus,

by a system of collation and induction, to discover practically those types

and elements of construction which have been found by experience most con-

ducive to good performances at sea. In the case of steam-ships, it was pur-

posed that the statistics of the original trials to which steamers are generally

put when new, should also be collected, classified, and collated with reference

to the subsequent performances of the same vessels at sea, whence it might

be determined to what extent and in what respects the usual smooth-water

trials of steam-ships may be indicative of the probable properties to be ex-

pected of the same ships at sea, as respects their dynamic capabilities.

The Committee are happy to say that this attempt at practically inquiring

into the peculiarities of construction to which the good or bad qualities of

steam-ships may be attributable, has not been wholly fruitless ; for, although

shipowners, shipbuilders, and marine engine manufacturers have been

generally reluctant to communicate particulars whereby the dynamic merits

of ships may be numerically classed and compared, the results of which clas-

sification and comparison might, if promulgated, affect the commercial value

of their property and the relative professional reputation of constructors,

still, in reply to the before-mentioned circular, information has been com-

municated as to the performance of vessels, particularly steam-vessels, by

which it appears that a great difference exists between steam-ships as respects

their economic capabilities for the performance of mercantile steam transport

service, leading to the conclusion that the general aggregate of steam service

is performed by vessels of inferior adaptation for economic duty, and con-

sequently at a rate of prime-cost expenditure ; and, therefore, ultimate charge
on the public, greatly in excess of that which would be involved if all steamers

were of the superior class of excellence that has been already in certain cases

actually attained. For example, this Committee are assured, on authority

which they believe to be unquestionable, that a certain vessel, the Bremen,

of 344'0 tons displacement at the time of trial, propelled by engines working

up to 1624; indicated horse-power, attained the speed of 13"15 nautical miles

per hour. Now, if we estimate the dynamic duty thus performed by the

the mutual relation of displacement, speed, and power, appears, from the
statements which have been communicated to this Committee, nearly 50 per
cent, higher than that realized by the average performance of tiie steam-ships
of the present day. The following are the coefficients of dynamic duty de-
duced by the foregoing rule from the performances of mercantile steamers

of high repute, of which the trial data have been communicated to this Com-
mittee, viz. 325, 294, 291, 288, 259, 248, 231, 230, and 204, and many others

below 200.
   This Committee therefore regard the Bremen as being a felicitous exem-

plification of naval arciiitecture as respects type of form adapted for easy

propulsion ; and as we conceive that the promulgation of some of the con-
structive elements of this vessel may be of public importance, we are happy
in being authorized and enabled, by Messrs. Caird and Co., of Greenock, the

constructors of the ship and of the engines, to communicate to the British

   Displacement at draught of 18' 6", or load draught .... 3440 ,,

   The foregoing data afford all the particulars required for the construction
of Peake's curve of vertical sections, whence may be deduced the position

of the vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of displacement, and
also the positions of the centre of gravity of the fore and aft bodies re-

spectively.

    It will be observed, from the foregoing data of the constructive elements

of the Bremen, that the maximum immersed section is at the middle of the

length, and that the vertical sections are in such ratio to each other, with
reference to their respective positions, that the curve of vertical sections will
be a close approximation to a parabola.

   The ratios deducible from the foregoing particulars of constructive data,
combining Peake's curve of immersed vertical sections with the curve of

displacement, will give a close approximation to the type of form of the im-

mersed hull.

   The engines of the Bremen consist of two direct- acting inverted cylinders,
90 inches diameter, and 3 feet 6 inches stroke, fitted with expansion valves

capable of working expansively to a high degree. All parts of the engines
are felted and lagged with wood wherever practicable, the lower 16 feet of
the funnel being surrounded by a casing forming a superheating chamber,
the steam entering at the lower end, and passing off at the top into the steam

pipes leading to the cylinders.

   On the important question as to the extent to which the ordinary smooth-

water trial of a steamer affords a criterion of the general average perform-

ance that may be expected of the vessel at sea, this Committee have not been

able to obtain such an extent of returns of the comparative smooth-water
--143 REPORT 1858.

trials aud sea performances of the same ships as enable them fully to respond
to this part of the inquiry, and they refrain from expressing any speculative
opinion, because they have adopted the principle which they desire to recom-
mend to the notice of the British Association, that shipping improvement is
to be discovered by statistical record and analysis of the constructive elements
of ships that have practically shown themselves to possess good sea-proper-
ties, rather than by assuming the mere theories of opinionative speculation,

--from whatever source such opinions may emanate, in short, that experience

of actual performances at sea, statistically recorded and utilized by being
made the basis of comparison, is the most reliable base on which to construct
an inductive system of progressive improvement in naval architecture and

marine-engine construction. This Committee, however, have much satisfac-
tion in being enabled to commence this inquiry by recording the sea per-
formance of the before-mentioned vessel Bremen, on a passage from Bremen

haven to New York and back, during the months of June and July last, during

the whole of which passages indicator cards were frequently taken, and the

indicated working power of the engines ascertained. On the out passage the

mean displacement was 2878 tons, the mean indicated horse-power was 1078,
and the mean speed 10*28 knots per hour, giving a coefficient by the formula
referred to^ 204; but on the return passage the mean displacement was
2990, the mean indicated horse-power 1010, and the mean speed at the rate
of 11*92 knots per hour, giving a coefficient=34'8. Hence the mean co-
efficient of the out and home passage=276, being about 13 per cent, below

the coefficient (319) obtained on the smooth-water test-trial of the ship.

The state of the weather and the sea was also recorded daily ; it appears to
have been adverse on the out passage, but favourable on the home passage.
The Committee are, therefore, of opinion that, by following up this course

of statistical record of the smooth-water trial and subsequent sea perform-
ances of ships respectively, a tabftlar statement might be compiled, showing
the probable ratios of the coefficients of smooth water and sea performance,

corresponding to the various rates of speed for which steamers may be re-
spectively powered, whence the smooth water test-trials of ships may be made

available as approximately indicative of their sea-service capabilities as
respects their dynamic properties.

    Such are the statistical data of the constructive elements and dynamic
capabilities of the ^remoi, and if all steam- vessels engaged in the mercantile
transport service of Britain were equally efl'ective as respects the mutual re-
lations of displacement, speed, and power, that is, capable of producing a co-

efficient of dynamic capability =31 9, by the formula referred to, it is probable

that the prime-cost expenses of steam-ship transport per ton weight of cargo
conveyed on long passages would, on the aggregate of the foreign trade of
Britain, be reduced not less than 25 per cent, as compared with the prime-
cost expenses incurred by steam-vessels of the average dynamic capability

in present use.

   The effect of improved type of build on the economy of steam transport

per ton weight of goods conveyed, is such as shows the inquiry to be of vital
importance in connexion with the management of steam-shipping affairs.

   The public importance of improved type of build in a national point of
view (for it is the public and not the shipowners who ultimately bear the
brunt of expensive transport service) may be judged of from the statistical
fact published by the Board of Trade, that no less than 899 steam- vessels
(of which 511 are sea-going ships) were employed on the commercial trans-
port service of Britain in 1857. The ratio in which the transport service of
the country is performed by the aid of steam appears to be constantly on the

increase ; and as it is to be expected that mercantile competition will always
cause the cost of freight on tlie general aggregate of the trade of the country

to be proportionally ruled by the prime-cost expenses that may be actually
incurred in doing the work, it appears manifest that the public economy de-

pendent on the general realization of shipping improvement is a considera-
tion that involves public interest to the extent of millions sterling per

annum.

   To demonstrate the vast importance of this subject, Appendix No. 2 has
been compiled from the returns of the Board of Trade, to show the amount
of trade between the United Kingdom and foreign countries during the year

1855. This compilation shows that the tons weight of cargo actually carried

in the foreign trade of the United Kingdom in the year 1855 amounted to

Imports         6,254,259 tons.
Exports         8,370,363 tons.

         Total  14,624,622 tons.

Nearly 15 millions of tons weight of sea-borne cargo, conveyed at probably
25 per cent, extra cost beyond what would be incurred if ships of the high

order of dynamic merit exemplified by the Bremen were only and exclusively

employed.

   By aid of Appendix No. 2, showing the amount of trade between Great

Britain and all foreign countries respectively, parties conversant with shipping
affairs will be enabled to estimate approximately the gross amount annually-
involved in the goods-transport service of Britain. Thus public interests
require that the statistical records of shipping should embrace such data as
will be availably conducive to shipping improvement, by affording the means
of approximately estimating the dynamic capabilities of ships, whereby every
ship constructor and ship owner, and the directors of steam-shipping compa-

nies, may be enabled to test the dynamic merits and condition of their ships

--respectively, a system, which would gradually lead to the adoption of such

types only as develope a high order of dynamic duty, and would obviate some
of the most serious hazards to which private and public interests are now
exposed from vessels being employed on commercial and postal services for
which they are not fit.

    Only let it be publicly known, as exemplified by the Bremen, that steam-

ships and their machinery may be so constructed, that on being subjected to

a test-trial, the cube of the speed in knots, multiplied by the square of the
cube root of the displacement, and divided by the indicated horse power,
ought, in the present day, irrespective of future improvement, to produce a
quotient or coefficient of dynamic duty equal to the number 319, and that
the coefficient deduced from the rule thus enunciated constitutes (ccBteris
paribus) a criterion of the cost price at which steam-ships perform their work
and we shall then soon find that this test of dynamic merit, or the numeral
coefficient deduced therefrom, will enter into the calculation of the pecuniary
value of steamers to such extent that ships of a low order of dynamic capa-

bility will not be built, because they will not sell.

   The test of dynamic merit, as above set forth, based on the mutual rela-
tions of displacement, speed, and power, presumes on the net power effect-
ively applied in propelling the ship being always in a constant and known

ratio to the gross indicated power.

   The inquiry, therefore, so far, is of such a nature as demands professional
knowledge and skill in order to determine and discriminate between the merit
that may be due respectively to the type of form of the hull, and to the con-
--244 REPORT 1858.

struction of the engines, propeller, and boilers ; for a good type of hull, pro-

pelled by an inferior construction of machinery and boilers, or an inferior

type of hull propelled by a good construction of machinery and boilers, may,

by the above formula, produce equal results. This Committee, however,

consider it of vital importance to the promotion of the objects of this in-

quiry, viz., "the maturing of a system of statistical record conducive to the

improvement of naval architecture," that the owners and charterers of ships,

and the directors of shipping companies or agents by whom shipping affairs

are conducted, should themselves have the means of ascertaining the relative

dynamic merits and working condition of their ships without any reference

whatever to the professional assistance of builders or engineers, but be enabled

to judge for themselves whether the performance be good or bad by refer-

ence to the data aiforded by their counting-house records ; and this desirable

object may be at once etfected by the displacement of the ship being known,

and by substituting in the foregoing formula the consumption of fuel in a

given time (say the weight in cwts. (W) consumed per hour), in lieu of the

expression for power, and regarding the hull, machinery, and boilers collect-

--ively as an integral equipment of which the coefficient derived from the
formula  v\t~^ indicates the dynamic condition with reference to the

--dynamic condition of other vessels tested by the same rule, viz.: Multiply the

cube of the speed by the square of the cube root of the mean displacement,

and divide the product by the consumption of fuel per hour expressed in

cwts. The quotient indicates the relative dynamic condition of the vessel.

For example : a steam-ship (A) performed out and home voyages amounting

to 7200 nautical miles in 652 hours, being at the average speed of 1 1 -O^

knots per hour, the consumption of coal was 1519 tons, or 30,380 cwts.,

being at the rate of 47 cwts. per hour, and the mean displacement was 2934

tons. Hence the coefficient of dynamic duty indicative of the merits of the

Again, another vessel (B), with a mean displacement of 840 tons, attains on

long-continued service, the average speed of 12-78 knots per hour, Avith the

average consumption of 50-3 cwts. coal per hour, giving a coefficient of

                                                                       =3693.

(A), the coefficient of dynamic duty, based on the consumption of fuel, is

5870, whilst in the other case (B), it is only 3693 ; that is, one cwt. of coal

A 1^in performs as much dynamically effective work as is performed by

cwt. in the case of B, a discrepancy which may well induce professional

inquiry being instituted by the shipowner, Avhether the inferior performance

Bof is occasioned by inferior type of form, or foulness of bottom, or inferior

principle of mechanical appliances, or inferior management, or bad coal ; for

these causes, combined, or indeed either one of them alone, may be sufficient

to account for the result.

   Now, what are the all-important elements of construction thus proposed to
be embraced in public records, and thereby made known to the purchasers
and charterers of ships with a view to enable such parties to test the economic
working capabilities of ships, so conducive to the reformation above referred
to? Why, by the rule above enunciated, the displacement corresponding to
the constructor's load draught at which the ship may be tried, and to which
approximately, as a general rule, the ship may be loaded, becomes the only

item of statistical data that requires to be officially recorded, for the test trial
ON SHIPPING STATISTICS.  245

and sea performances of ships, as above shown, will give the capabilities for
speed ; and tlie consumption of fuel per hour corresponding thereto will be

known from the counting-house ledger.

    It is, therefore, suggested that the registration records of every ship give

the displacement when the ship is immersed down to some definite line, which
may be denominated the constructor's load line.

   The assignment of the constructor's load line draught forward and aft, and

the corresponding displacement, are all the statistical data that are required to
be registered in addition to the details of registration already enforced under

the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, in order to determine the comparative
coefficients, and put the system of practical rivalry hereby suggested into
operation, as being the most effective system for inducing improvement in

naval architecture.

   As regards the existing system of shipping statistics and shipping registra-

tion, with reference to its affording data available for promoting shipping
improvement, this Committee has to observe that, although the aggregate
register tonnage of mercantile shipping appears to be a very close approxi-
mation to the aggregate weight-carrying capability of the entire mercantile

navy, still, when considered in detail with reference to particular ships, it

is found that the register tonnage of a ship affords no approximate criterion
whatever either of the load displacement or of the weight-carrying capabili-
ties of sliips respectively ; for, by reference to Appendix No. 2, it will be found
that ships are frequently loaded with dead weight of cargo to the extent of
double their register tonnage, and the statement (Appendix No. 2) shows
the following extreme cases of weight-carrying capability with reference to

register tonnage :

   A further instance of the insufficiency of our present system of shipping

registration as statistical data indicative of the size of the hull of steam ship-
ping, is afforded by the statement given in Appendix No. 3, which has been

deduced from a Return of the House of Commons, showing the per-centage
deduction from the gross tonnage allowed for the engine rooms of steam-ships
whence we see that, without any reference whatever being made to the actual
weight of the machinery, deductions are made from the gross tonnage vary-
ing from 5 per cent, to 92 per cent, of the gross measurement, the remainder

only being brought to account as the registered tonnage of the ship.
    In conclusion, this Committee beg to observe, that if the views thus

brought before the notice of the British Association should be deemed worthy
of further prosecution, and be favourably entertained by the Government,
the statistics of the Post-office, as respects the constructive elements, and
test trials, and subsequent sea performances of the various steam-ships em-
ployed in H. M. Mail Service, would afford a collection of statistical data
which, if duly analysed and applied as herein suggested, would greatly pro-
mote the objects of this inquiry, which the British Association has thus been

pleased to institute.

   The Committee have the painful duty of announcing the death of one of its
members, James Perry, Esq., whose personal character, practical intelligence,
and public usefulness, were of such an order, that his decease may be mourned

as a public loss.

           -- 26th April, 1 858.

   Gentlemen, The attention of the British Association at their late Meet-

ing in Dublin, having been directed to the consideration of shipping statistics,
the Committee of the Association came to the resolution " that the applica-
tion of science to the improvement of steam-ships has been impeded by the
difficulty of obtaining the necessary data from the present registration " ; a

         ON THE IRELAND-MAGNETIC-SURVEY INSTRUMENTS. 261

one of which is loaded with a small weight, placed at a fixed distance from

the centre on the southern arm. The observation consists of two parts, in

one of which the product of the earth's magnetic force into the magnetic

moment of the magnet is found by observing the position of equilibrium of
the loaded needle, when placed on the agate planes ; while, in the other, the
ratio of the same quantities is found by employing the same needle to deflect
another substituted in its place. The apparent obstacle to the success of this
method lies in the smallness of the angle of deflection produced by a dipping-
needle, when employed as a deflector at the usual distances; the error of the
deduced force being inversely as the sine of the angle of deflection. The
equation of equilibrium of the deflected needle involves a quantity, which
may be expanded into a series of the inverse odd powers of the distance (be-

ginning with the inverse third), the coefficients of which are functions of cer-
tain integrals depending on the distribution of magnetism in the two needles.

The law of distribution being unknown, these coefficients can only be deter-
mined by repeating the observation at several known distances, and elimi-
nating among the resulting equations. Now, at the distances usually em-
ployed in observations of deflection, the angle of deflection produced by a
dipping-needle would be too small for accuracy; and if the distance be
diminished, the number of terms of sensible value will be increased, and

there will arise increased difficulty and uncei-tainty in the elimination. This
difficulty is avoided by availing ourselves of a circumstance which ap-
pears to have been generally' overlooked. It is not necessary that the
usual deflection distance should be one of the series employed in deducing
the coefficients of the inverse powers of the distance in the value of the
constant ; it is not even requisite that the relative positions of the two
magnets should be similar in the two cases : for if the value of the cor-
responding function be found, for any other position, and at any other
distance, that of the required function will be known by a comparison of the
deflections produced. Accordingly, the principle of the present method (so
 far as the deflection process is concerned) consists in observing the angle of
 deflection in the regular series of observations, at a very short distance, the
deflecting needle being attached to the moveable arm of the divided circle
which carries the verniers, so as to be always rendered perpendicular to the
 deflected needle in the course of the observation. In the determination of
 the constant the whole apparatus is to be turned in azimuth, until the de-

flected needle is vertical. The deflecting magnet is then to be removed from

 its usual position above described, and placed horizontally on a support out-
 side the box on a level with the agate planes, and the equilibrium produced
 by turning the apparatus in azimuth as before. This observation having
 been repeated at several known distances, we have all the data for the deter-

 mination of the unknown constant. By these means the uncertainty of the

 result, arising from the smallness of the angle of deflection, is removed from
 the regular series of observations, and thrown upon the determination of the

 constant, which may be made at leisure, and repeated as often as is requisite
 for accuracy. Even when the constant is undetermined, the instrument may

--be used to observe the total force relatively, tlie method having this advan-

 tage over other relative methods hitherto used, that the results are completely
 independent of the changes of the magnetic moments of the needles in the inter-
 vals of observation. Dr. Lloyd concluded by stating some of the results of
 the survey, so far as they have been calculated. But as these calculations

 are still incomplete, the results can only be regarded for the present as pro-

  visional.

       Report of Dublin Dredging Committee, appointed 1857-58.

              Bij Professor J. U. Kinahan, M.D., M.R.I.A.

--During the past year, the following districts, all in the immediate vicinity of

Dublin, have been examined: Killiney Bay, Bray Head, Kish Bank, South
Strand, Dalkey Sound, Howth, Malahide, Lough Shinny, Bettystown, and
considerable advance made towards the completion of the Report. The

--following numbers of species have been catalogued:

   Fishes, 60; MoUusca, including Polyzoa, 262; Crustacea, 105; Arachnida, 5;

Echinodermata, 29; Hj'drozoa, 60; Actinozoa, 17; Sponges, 10; and many
Annelides not yet identified. Various untoward events prevented the Com-

mittee from carrying out fully the dredging arrangements which they had

made at the commencement of the year. For the better perfecting of the
Report, they have determined to allocate to the several Members of the

--Committee certain classes of animals as the special object of study, and have

divided these as follows : Professor Kinahan, M.D., Articulata and Sponges;
Dr. Carte, Vertebrata ; Dr. Wright, MoUusca; and Professor J. R. Greene,
Echinodermata, Ccelenterata, &c. They propose also to include in their final
report, as complete a list of the fishes of Dublin Bay as practicable, for which,
as well as the further prosecution of their dredging researches, they would
ask for a grant not exceeding £15 for the year 1858-59, the Committee
consisting, as last year, of Professor Kinahan, Dr. Carte, Dr. Wright, and
Professor Greene.

Report on Crustacea of Dublin District. By John Robert Kina-

 --han, M.D., M.R.I.A., Professor of Zoology in the Department of

   Science and Art, Part I. Decapoda Podophthalmatu.

The marine districts comprised in this Report consist of a series of open

bays, into most of which a river-mouth  enters                                   and of one or two extensive
                                                                              ;

--Band-banks which lie off the east coast of Ireland.
   The chief stations are Dublin Bay and the estuaries of the rivers Dodder,

Anna Liffey, and Tolka ; a long lighthouse pier separates this into sub-
districts--the North and South Bulls. The South Bull is almost exclusively

fine sand, containing great numbers of broken shells, being made up from

the washings of a cliff of marine drift ; an extensive strand, left dry here at

low water, is dotted over with sand-pools, in which Careinus BIcenas, Mgsis

vulgaris, Mysis ChamcBleon, PalcEmon squilla, P. varians, Crangon vulgaris,

AGammarus locusta, Gammartis palmatus and other species are found.

tidal stream called the Cockle lake, divides the bed of drift already spoken of

from the strand proper; this at high tides is in many places from 2 to 3

fathoms deep, but is singularly destitute of Crustacea ; the bottom is a quick-

sand.

Passing along from this station towards Kingstown Harbour, we meet

several patches of Zostera, in which Port, holsatus is found in some numbers

liaving passed Kingstown, the bay becomes rocky, one or two zostera-clad

banks, here called Mullet Grass, being interspersed among the rocks; one of

these, near Sandycove, furnished me at low water with the foUowingspecies:

Hipjiolyte varians, H. Cranchii, Pandalus leptorliynchiis (new species),

Mysis vidgaris and chamcEleo7i, Crangon vulgaris, Crangon fasciutus,

Apseudes talpa, Atelecyclus heterodon.

ON CRUSTACEA OP DUBLIN DISTRICT.                               263

Dalkey Sound, a narrow channel, separating Dalkey Island from the main

land and from 3 to 10 fathoms deep, bounds the Dublin station. In the

Sound, the following species occur: -Portunus depurator, puber, holsatus and

pusillus, Inachus Dorynchus and Dorsetfensis, Hyas coarctatus, Eurynome

aspera, Pirimela denticulata, Pinnotheres piswn, Ebalia Pennantii and

Cranchii, Bernhardus Streblonyx, Thompsonii, Cuanensis, Ulidianus and

Hyndmanni, Galathea Andreiosii, strigosa and squamifera, Palinurus vul-

garis, Hippolyte varians, Thompsonii and pusiola, Pandalus annulicornis,

and many of the commoner species.

Killiney Bay, which succeeds this, and is bounded by Bray, is partly sand

and part shingle and rocks ; it calls for no detailed description. At Bray the
Bray river enters and forms a mud bank in about 10 fathoms to the south

ot" Bray Head ; here, in the lobster pots, Pcdcemon serratus has been said to
have been taken. Distant about 7 miles from Bray Head is a bed called

the Scallop bed, part of the Kish bank, the water varying from 6 to over 25

fathoms. Here many rare and one previously undescribed species has

occurred, such as Crangon sculptus, Crangon Allmanni, Galathea Andrewsii,

all the Bernhardi, except Prideauxii, the two Ebalias already mentioned,

Acanthonotus testudo, Ampelisca tyjncus, Nephrops Norvegicus.

The North Bull, owing to the influx of the three rivers already named, is

chiefly mud passing into rock at Howth : this district has never been care-

fully explored, but the following species are often thrown upon the white

sand, a bank similar to that already noted as the South Bull : Corystes Cas-

sivelaunus, Portumnus variegatus, Pilumnus hirtellus.

Balscaddan Bay, Howth, is rocky ; here Amphitoe littorina is common,

MyHippolyte varians, Hippolyte Cranchii,  sis vulgaris and chamceleon,

Porcellana platycheles.

   Portmarnock Bay, which next succeeds, is chiefly sandy, slob banks occur-

ring in parts. At Malahide a great muddy estuary, due to the influx of the
Swords river, is found. This mud slob is separated from that at Rush and

Lusk by the Burrow of Portrane, which is sandy like the two Bulls ; to the
north of this the coast becomes rocky till we get to Skerries, where three

islands cause the formation of a bank, from which in 10 fathoms the late

Robert Ball, LL.D., procured Crangon trispinosus, and Diastylis Rathhii.
   From Skerries to the mouth of the Boyne the beaches are all sandy, and

call for no special remark.

   Two outlying stations, viz. Ireland's Isle, or Eye, near Howth and Lambay,

which lie abreast of Portrane, have afforded many rarities ; but never

having personally examined them, I must defer particular notice of them till

some future period.

The fluviatile districts afford us AstacusJluviatilis, Gammarus Jluviatilis,

besides Entomostraca in abundance. At the mouths of rivers many of the

marine species ascend even into the fresh water ; these are marked in the

accompanying Tables as subfluviatile; they are Crangon vulgaris, Mysis

cJiamceleon ? and vulgaris, Gammarus Jluviatilis, Spheroma serratum,

Orchestia laevis, Orchestia littorea, Corophium longicorne, Carcinus Manas.

The terrestrial species are at present recorded in greater numbers than in

any other district, probably having been more sought after, all the genera,

BdMe Platyarthriis, being represented here. The chief species wanting in the

Dublin lists are those which frequent deep water, and which Avill probably

be yet found when the deeper parts of the Bay are better searched. Mud

burrowers are also absent, which will most certainly yet be found. It is
intended to embody all remarks bearing on the peculiarities of the distribu-

tion of species in the last part of this report ; at present I shall content myself

with a summary of the species belonging to the Decapoda found here, con-
trasting tills with tlie numbers found in Great Britain generally, and also

with those found in Ireland.

   The exact habitat of several species recorded here is as yet a desideratum,
although some of these are by no means rare as drift species ; these are
Portumnusvariegalus, Corystes Cassivelau7iiis,extreme\y common; Gonoplax

angulatusy drifted in at Portmarnock (supposed to inhabit mud banks near
Knocknagin ; for this note I am indebted to Charles Farran, M.D.) ; Ate-

lecyclus heterodon (full-grown specimens), Portunus arcuatus, Portunus
corrugatus, Galathea nexa, Bcriihardus Prideauxii, Palcemon serratus, Pali-
nurus vulgaris.

   The following species have as yet been noted only on the Dublin coast:
Orangon Allmanni (also Belfast, August 1858), Pandalus leplorhynchus,

Iphimedia Ehlance.
    Thefollovving hasnot occurred elsewhere inlreland: Crangon trispinosus;

and many species, as Crangon sciilptus, C. fascialus, Pirimela denticulata,

are of extreme rarity elsewhere.
   In Dublin Bay, as will be seen by reference to Table B, Appendix, have

been recorded fifty-nine species of Decapoda out of the ninety-one positively

--recorded in Ireland. These represent thirty genera, the genera wanting
--here being Maia, Pisa, AchcEus (?), Polybius, Thia, Nika (?), Alphetis,

Athanas all genera of the south and west ; Munida, Gehia, Calocaris, Cal-
lianassa, genera of deep sea or niud-burrowers, and Cynthilia, Macromysis,
 Vaunthoynpsonia, Iphinoe, and Cyrianassa, genera as yet but little under-
stood and easily overlooked. Pasiphae. is the only genus which has not
been met elsewhere in Ireland ; its occurrence in Dublin is doubtful (vide
Appendix, Table A).

   Of the thirty-two Irish species not recorded in Dublin and not belonging
to the genera here noticed, Xantho rivulosa and tuberculata, Portu7ius car-

cinoides and iiiarmoreus, Pinnotheres veterum, Hippolyte Mitchelli, Palcemon
Leachii, Mysis Griffithsii (?), are probably western and southern. Inachus
leptochirus, Crangon bispinosus, Bernhardus Forbesii, inhabitants of deep
water, and Crangon spinosus, a northern species; Pernhardtis Icevis and
AchcBus Cranchii have been reported to me, but I hesitate to insert them at

present-

   As compared with the numbers given as British, it must be borne in mind
that among the latter are included many whose specific value is doubtful ; at
the same time we could scarcely expect that all the northern or southern

species which occur around the coast of Great Britain, should ever be found

here. Of most of the species recorded here, I have procured specimens in
ova, from many of which I have succeeded in hatching the zoes ; these, should
time permit, I would propose to notice in the concluding portion of my
report, when I come to speak of the development of the group generally.

    Lists of the genera, families, and species are appended.

On River Steamers, their Form, Construction, and Fittings, with re-

  ference to the necessity for improving this present means of Shallow

   Water Navigation on the Rivers of British India. By Andrew

   Henderson, A.I.C.E., M.S. A., F.R.G.S.

               [A Communication ordered to be printed entire among the Reports.]

--1. Comprehensive Objects aimed at. Tlie object of tills paper is to offer

some suggestions for tlie improvement and extension of steam navigation on
the Ganges, Burhampootra, and Irrawaddy, in the east, and on the Indus and
the Punjaub rivers on the west, now forming the river boundaries of England's

empire in India ; the coasts and harbours aiFording a desirable field for

maritime enterprise, and the employment of British shipping. The valleys,
deltas, and upper affluents of those rivers extend many thousand miles
through some of the most populous and fertile regions in the world, the whole

route from east to west traversing the most ancient sites of civilization and
channels of trade, there being a probability that the navigation of the Indus
                    ;

ON RIVER STEAMERS.  269

will be brought into connexion with the Ganges by means of a canal uniting
their upper branches so as eventually to enable vessels of suitable form and
dimensions to pass uninterruptedly from Kurratche on the west coast, through

--the whole riverine system of British India.
   2. Proposal for the attainment. Of late years many plans and proposals
have been brought forward for improving and extending the means of internal
communication in India, and of laying open to European commerce and

civilization the productive resources and capabilities of the country.

  --3. These projects may be divided into two classes, those which consist in

improving the means of land transport, and those which refer to water

transport.

 --Of the first class there are three kinds roads, tram-roads, and railroads ;
--of the second there are also three kinds : river navigation in the main
--channels, canal navigation in connexion with irrigation, and lastly, that which

forms the subject of the present paper the navigation of the shallow creeks,
upper branches, and minor affluents of the great Indian rivers and deltas.

   4-. Of the first class, all require not only the construction of vehicles, but

of the tracks which the vehicles are to traverse, and are consequently expen-
sive, and require a considerable period of time before they can be brought

into practical operation.

   Of the second class, with the exception of canals which are supposed to be

constructed with other views than that of being only navigable channels, the
others merely require the construction of the vehicles, and are consequently
the cheapest, simplest, and at the same lime the most readily available.

   5. To make the importance of the utilisation of the existing means of com-
munication by shallow-water navigation more readily understood, it may not
be out of place to make a few general remarks upon each of the plans above

enumerated.

 -- --6. Prese)it Roads in India. First, as to roads such as deserve the name

in India, have hitherto been those which were necessitated by considerations
affecting the military tenure of the country, or were confined to such trunk-

lines of communication as afforded the greatest facilities for military opera-
tions, conjointly with the most pressing requirements of the commercial inter-
ests of the community. In all countries (where water transport is not available)

the number and excellence of the roads may be taken as a fair index of the

condition of the population, and the surest test of their comparative progress
in civilization. Judged by this standard, it is not, perhaps, overstating the
present condition of the greater portion of our Indian empire to say, that it
is hardly above the level of Britain during the occupation of the Romans.

    7. There were splendid military roads leading from one great military
station to another; if these stations coincided with commercial positions of
importance, that was an advantage of secondary importance.

    8. That such should in a great measure have been, until recently, the con-

dition of British India, may be matter of regret, but it would scarcely be fair
to lay the blame exclusively upon the government of the East India Company.

Since the relinquishment of their charter as traders, their first duty was to
govern the country, to maintain order, peace, and tranquillity. Accordingly,
whatever was done in furtherance of these ends was done, and done well
but it was obviously impossible, considering the extent of territory under

their sway, to do anything beyond constructing such trunk-lines of commu-

nication as were required for military and strategic purposes.
   9. In these modern days of large enterprises, however, there seems to be

a fatal tendency " to run before we learn to walk," to overlook and despise
--270 REPORT 1858.

the necessity of turning to the most natural and preliminary means of inter-
course, which ought to precede and pave the way for more improved and
costly means of traffic. Because we cannot do all, we are disposed to do no-
thing ; because we cannot have railways, we neglect to make the roads by
which the railways might be fed and supported ; and, lastly, because in such

a poor country we cannot afford to construct public roads, we refuse, unless

in a very imperfect and limited way, to turn to account the existing facilities
for water transport afforded by the numerous upper branches and minor afflu-

ents of the great Indian rivers which traverse the country in every direction.

  --10. Available Shalloio-water Navigation. Of all conceivable means of

transport from one place to another, that by water (where a smooth and level
highway is provided by nature) is at once the most universal, simple, and

least expensive. It is very certain that the coracle and tlie canoe were in use
long before the existence of wheeled carriages and roads adapted to them,
for the very obvious reason, that carriages even of the rudest description
require a road to be prepared for them. The ground requires, to a certain
extent, to be levelled and freed from obstructions along the whole route which
the vehicle has to traverse ; whereas, in water transport, the route is made
and levelled to hand ; all that was required was a hollow tree, or a raft of
loose branches tied together. There was, moreover, this additional advan-

tage, that such a mode of conveyance required less labour for traction, and
at the same time admitted of the application of other than human or animal
labour, by turning to account the propulsive power of the winds, tides, and

other currents.

  --11. Of all the different modes by which it is proposed to increase the means

of internal communication in India, roads, tram-roads, and railroads, river
navigation, canal navigation, and the utilisation of the shallow water chan-

--nels there is not one but what is under certain local and commercial con-

ditions, good and expedient ; but it ought to be borne in mind that they have
each and all a certain natural and inevitable relation to each other ; that is,
the most improved and expensive means of communication (as regards the
first outlay) must be preceded and aided by the next lowest, or rather the
next more simple and less expensive mode.

    12. Pathways are feeders to turnpikes, and these to railroads; and as a
multiplicity of small streams unite to form even a small river, so do these
latter in turn unite to form the main current of the principal rivers.

    13. As before stated, the most universal, the simplest, and least expensive
means of transport is that afforded by the natural water channels ahvady
existing in the country, and which constitute the general basis from which
all the other and more improved means have been derived and rendered
practicable. But with our usual tendency to expensive and ponderous modes

of procedure, the system of most of the water transport organized by English-

men in India has been encumbered by the extended scale upon which it has

hitherto been attempted. Nothing short of steamers of the same construc-
tion and dimensions as those in use in England and America have been
thought eligible for the requirements of river navigation in India.

    14. Now, viewing the main channels of tlie principal rivers as trunk-lines
of traffic, there cannot be a doubt that vessels of considerable dimensions
are desirable for the conveyance of the large and regular amount of traffic
which is to be anticipated on a trunk-line of communication ; but this advan^
tage of using vessels of large dimensions is limited by the disadvantage of
the greater draft of water which they require, owing to the increased weight

ol the vessels thcniselve:?. This increase in the draught of water i)recludcs
ON RIVER STEAMERS.  271

vessels of large dimensions from entering the upper branches and minor
tributaries of the great Indian rivers.

    15. Taking into account the provisions already made, or in process of con-
struction for opening up the interior of India, by trunk-lines of railway, by
roads, canals, and steam navigation on the main channels of the great rivers,
and also taking into account the present and probable future condition of

India for many years to come, it would appear that the most urgent and im-

--perative requirements of India are not so much for additional trunk-lines of

traffic, as for feeders to supply them not so much for main arteries of com-

merce as for the capillaries by which they are to be kept alive. Railways in

India or elsewhere would be comparatively useless if it were not for the means
by which merchandise is conveyed to their termini.

    16. However comprehensive the scheme by which the railway system of
India has been arranged, no system which does not take into account the
minor tributaries or existing means of communication with their termini can

be considered complete.

  --17. The Improvement of Native Boats proposed. The entire traffic on the

upper branches and minor affluents of the great rivers is at present conducted
by means of native boats of a peculiar description, which have been in use
from the earliest periods ; and since the construction of roads by the natives
themselves has ever been most unwillingly undertaken, there can be no hope

of their ever improving much in this respect.
   18. There is therefore every certainty that for many years to come these

native boats must be the means of conveying the great bulk of Indian pro-
duce either to the termini of the railways, or to those stations on the main
channels of the great rivers which can be reached by the large steamers
now employed.

   19. From this point of view, then, it will be seen, (hat on the improve-
ment of the native river craft depends a very considerable portion of what-
ever success may attend the opening up of the country by trunk-lines, either

of roads, canals, river navigation, or railways.

 --20. Review of Native Boats and record of the earliest Steamers built in

Bengal. With the view of calling public attention to the important functions
fulfilled by these boats, I have prepared the accompanying brief description
of the principal types of vessels now in use.

   21. Quoting from an account of steam navigation in British India, com-
piled by G. A. Prinsep, Esq., and published by the Government at Calcutta

Ain 1830, Appendix, 4, containing etchings illustrating twenty-eight different

kinds of native boats used on the Bengal rivers, from the ponderous Budge-
row or accommodation boat and fast-pulling Bhauleah used by the English,

--to the burthensome Patelu and Chuprah Oolak of forty tons, also to the

Pansuai fast-pulling fishing dinghee and Mor Punkhee or native pleasure-

boat, all being of tiie Nautilus type of form, use the balanced rudder, steer-
oar or skull at the stern ; the latter using an oar as a bow-rudder.

   22. The notable features of these vessels are, that they are generally built
upon rounded lines, the bottom resembling the immersed portion of a Nautilus
shell. This general contour, together with the absence of dead wood and
gripe, appear to be dependent upon the character of the rudder employed,

which is generally a large triangular board, with a post attached to the centre,
so that the fore-part of the blade falls under what would be styled the dead
wood of a river barge. The whole arrangement is intended to give the boat
great facility for quick turning, to avoid sand-banks, &c. Tiie dimensions
appear to be from 20 to 80 feet in length, and from 7 to 26 ieet in breadtli,
the draft of water varying fiom 1 to 5 feet, and the burden from 4 to 40 tons.

   24. The publication contains lOi pages, in six chapters, on private sp(-cu-

lation, the government sea and river steamei's, detailed accounts of experi-

ments and opinions of the late General W. N. Forbes and other officers, with

plans of the following steamers :

   25. The King of Oude's steamer, built at Lucknow, the engines brought
out by Mr. Henry Jessop, in 1819. The 'Diana,' built at Calcutta in 1823,
and employed in the Burmese war in 1824. The ' Enterprise,' the first vessel
that steamed out to India in 1825. The ' Irrawaddy ' and ' Ganges,' govern-
ment sea steamers, built by Mr. Seppings, at Calcutta, in 1827. There is also

a plan of tiie Forbes steam-tug, launched in January 1829, at Calcutta, of the

construction of which I had the superintendence, and in March 1830 con-
ducted her to China, towing a vessel of 380 tons, against the monsoon, as

stated in the 18th page.

   26. For river navigation in the Assam valley, the government launched
the ' Burhampootra ' and ' Hooghly' early in 182*7 ; the former 102 feet long
by 18 broad, built by Mr. Kyd, with the round bilge design by Maudsley and
Co. ; the ' Hooghly ' being built by Mr. I. M. Seppings, with flat floor, square
bilge, and upright sides. The third and fourth chapters give details of various
trials of these two, and opinions that the ' Hooghly ' steered so badly, that the
Marine Board considered a " rudder in the bow seemed the best remedy."

   27. 1 have entered into this detail as the papers now before me will afford
much valuable information as to the actual performances of the vessels first

established by government on the Indian rivers; thepeculiar character of
that navigation and the difficulties to be contended with are nowhere to be
found so well illustrated as in this record of practical trials, and the opinions
of various sea oflScers, engineers, professional builders, and naval architects.

   28. The fourth chapter contains information peculiarly applicable to the
present pressing demand for water transport by the Great Trunk Railways,
now in course of construction up the valleys of the Ganges and Indus,
by the East Indian and Scinde Railway Companies. The recent crisis of a
mutinous army in the valley of the Ganges (now happily past), has left the

Tumlcok, or Flat Type.

Delta of the Ganges below Calcutta. These have their rudders hung through a recess in the

stern, and may, in common with those already described, be tilted up out of the water by
means of depressing the upper end of the pole to which they are hung.

roads so unsafe for goods as to force the usual native land traffic to seek
security by the private river steamers ; the two established companies reali-

zing fabulous freights of £20 to £30 per ton, and even sea-tugs towing native
boats up the rivers. The exigencies of the government for military trans-

port service, have necessitated the employing of most of the private steamers
in conveying troops and stores, from the utter inadequacy of the few govern-
ment vessels to meet one-third the requirements of the public service.

   29. I beg to submit a brief historical analysis and tabular statement of the
particulars of the various enterprises by which the steam navigation of the

Ganges has been hitherto attempted.
   30. In ISS't the Indian government established the first system of steam-

--tug and tow-boats on the Ganges. Both vessels were of similar form,

dimensions, and tonnage 120 feet in length by 22 feet in breadth, and

275 tons.
   31. The mode of towing may be understood by a reference to the sketch

of deck plans exhibited, in which it will be seen that the two vessels were

placed some distance apart.

   32. The engines were from 50 to 90 horse-power, and the speed averaging

from 6i to 7| miles an hour, or 50 miles a day on the upward passage, and
80 miles a day down stream in the dry season. During the rains, the rates

Wwere miles and 100 miles up and down the stream respectively. Their

draft of water was from 3 to 4 feet, the capability for dead weight cargo 60
to 100 tons. They were very flat-bottomed, having upright stem- and stern-
posts, and large barge rudders often injured by collision.

  --33. System of Tug- and Toiv- Boats established on the Burhampootra, by the

Assam Company. In 1841 the Assam Company established on the Bur-

hampootra a system of powerful tug steamers, carrying passengers and towing

smaller cargo-boats, as shown in the second line of plans in the sketch, and

in the three diagrams of midship sections on the right of the centre, consist-
ing of the 'Assam' steamer, 140 feet in length by 27 feet in breadth, 443

--tons, builders' measurement, and having engines of 100 horse-power the

' Naga' tow-boat of 90 feet in length, 18 feet in breadth, and 91 tons. These

I designed for the Assam Company as adaptations of the rounded lines and
"Nautilus" form of the best river-boats of Bengal, the ' Katoora,' ' Dacca

Pulwar,' and ' Tumlook ' boat shown in the sketch.

34. The form and mode of suspending the rudder were also derived from

the same sources. Of these balanced rudders, two-thirds of the blade wore

placed abaft the spindles, the rudders occupying the space of the dead wood,

Abut not extending beyond the stern.  small rudder forward occupied the

same position in the bow. By this arrangement, as the vessels had no keel,

the two rudders fulfilled the functions of dead wood and gripe in steady

steering, and gave the power of turning the vessel on the centre, when they

were placed in opposite directions.

   35. The peculiar advantages of these double rudders, in steering a train of

tow-boats, will be best explained by a reference to shear and deck plans of

the bow and stern of two vessels of the " Nautilus" type, now proposed for

military transport service, 100 feet in length, 15 feet in breadth, and 109 tons,

builders' measurement. The diagram of midship sections and height of deck

will be seen on the left of the centre, in juxtaposition with the sections of

the 'Assam' steamer, 'Naga' tow-boat, and an iron tea-boat now navigating

the Burhampootra with a native crew; the dimensions are, 75 feet in length,

12 feet in breadth, 7 feet deep, and 52 tons, builders' measurement.
   36. From the difficulty experienced by the Assam Company in obtaining
                                                                          --

ON RIVER STEAMERS.                          275

labour for the cultivation of tea, the crops were so limited, that, in the al)-

sence of support from the Bengal government, there was not sufficient traffic

to maintain such expensive vessels on the Burhampootra. The 'Assam' and

' Naga' were consequently employed on the Ganges, making eleven voyages

to Allahabad. The other private steamers established on the Ganges were,

in 1836, the Calcutta Steam-Tug Association, and from IS^S to 1845, the

Ganges Steam Company and the General Inland Steam Navigation Com-

pany. The latter adopted a system of long light-built steamers, carrying

passengers and towing two small cargo-boats with dead wood and gripe, and

provided with large barge rudders, like the government vessels, which

resulted in the loss of the first vessel, the ' Sir Herbert Maddock,' in the

Hooghly. The shares of this Company, like all other steam enterprises

in India unsupported by government, have fallen to one-fourth their cost,

while competing for freight with public steamers. The dimensions, tonnage,

and the amount of engine power employed in these vessels are here presented

in a tabular form for comparison, with the amount of capital invested dedu-

cing from the displacement and weight of hull, the cost per ton of carrying

capability at different drafts of water.

    38. Relative Financial Position, dependent on the capabilities for weight

--cargo, with Tabular Comparison of Vessels. This Table (p. 276, § 37) shows

the relative financial position of the different enterprises, at the same cost price

per ton, and in horse-power or capital expended in obtaining a capability for

weight t;argo, at light drafts of water which in our Indian rivers is of more im-

portance than high speed. This was practically proved in the large and power-

ful 'Mirzapore\and ' Ghazeepore,' which draw too much water to be profitably

employed during the dry season, to obviate which they built large light tow-

boats ; but experience has recently shown this was getting into another diffi-

Aculty of serious magnitude.  letter from Calcutta by last mail, states,

" It is but a short time ago the Ganges Company lost a tow-boat from the

same cause, being an iron vessel, very light, and over 250 feet in length; in

coming up the river through the Sunderbunds, she would not answer her

helm in coming round a spit of sand, and in consequence came foul of a
steamer, and, in fact, cut her own throat, going down soon after."

39. It will be seen from the Table that these are the longest and largest

steamers on the Ganges, and were designed on the American system of large

cargo steamers ; also that none of the present steamers on the Ganges carry

Aany cargo at 2 feet draft of water.      reference to the capital columns shows

a great increase of cost of capability as the draft of water decreases, the

cost varying from 36558 per ton at 3 feet ; £SS at 4- feet in the steamers

' Patna' and ' Benares ; ' while, witii the Nautilus flotilla of one tug and three

tow-boats I have proposed, the cost of capital will be £75 per ton at 2 feet

draft, £31 per ton at 3 feet, and only £19 per ton at a load draft of 4 feet,

with a capability of 360 tons of dead weight cargo between the four vessels.
   40. The relative capability for weight cargo of the various vessels whose

particulars are given and shown on the Plan, will be best seen in the following

Table (p. 276, § 41), in which the ratio of capability for weight cargo to the

load displacement is stated for each, at the same draft of water, as well as

their relative load displacements at the 3 feet load water-line. The Table also

shows the draft at light water-line, with the displacement due to the weight of

the several vessels, in tons ; and also the ratio which this weight bears to the

external bulk of the hull in cubic feet, as affording the best criterion of the

weight of material necessary for strength.

76 REPORT-- 1858.

ON RIVER STEAMERS.  277

Tow-boats from 100 to 200 feet long, in Flotillas offour vessels of small class

--to two of largest, to meet the present requirements of the Bengal Hivers.

Taking all the data given, botii with regard to what is required, and what
has been done in meeting these requirements, I have arrived at the following

conclusive opinions:
    43. 1st. It is better to attempt constructing a vessel adapted for the general

purposes of inland and coast navigation, than to endeavour to supply special
local requirements. 2nd. That for the present exigencies of Government and
the railway companies, together with the aspect of the country in the proba-
bilities to be anticipated, the wants of all will be most cheaply, speedily, and
effectively supplied, by adopting a uniform model, and system of fittings and
towing, which, with slight modifications suggested by local circumstances,

may be readily adapted to each case; the following being the smallest vessels

to which steam can be economically applied, and the largest conveniently navi-

gated, by native crews without steam.

 --M. Dimensions. To be 100 feet in length, 15 feet in breadth, and 6 feet

in depth, the deck extending one-third of the breadth beyond the sides to
form a guard board ; the roof of the deck-houses to rise 15 feet above the

--keel for half the breadth and length of the vessel.
   Proportions. To range from eight breadths to five, as circumstances may

--require.
   Form. Where light draft is essential, the main breadth to extend for

about three breadths, or half the length of the vessel, the middle of the main
breadth or dead flat to be one-third of the breadth abaft the centre of the
vessel's length ; the bottom of bow and stern to be curved up from the dead
flat to the extremities of bow and stern ; the angle of rise of floor to be one
degree, and the bilge to be turned within one square foot.

    45. In the arrangement proposed, the cargo, boilers, and fuel are placed

below, while the engine and passengers are placed above the deck. The
framing of the deck-houses is made subservient to the strengthening of the

vessel longitudinally, and although in connexion with the framing of the
vessel, it is distinct, and can be at any time removed.

   46. I propose that the shell of the vessel should be made of the lightest
material consistent with strength ; the hulls to be built in three distinct com-
partments, with bow and stern bulkheads placed one-third of the breadth
within the stem and stern as supports for the necessary attachments.

   The central compartment to be two breadths within the inner bulkheads,

and to contain the whole of the machinery and fuel. When it is required to

use the vessel as a cargo-boat this machinery to be removed.

  --47. Other systems of Towing compared with the Nautilus Tug and Tow-

boat. With regard to the particular mode of towing vessels and the kind of

connexion which experience has proved to be convenient and safe, I consider

that it is not expedient to articulate together the vessels as in the plan

--adopted on the Indus lliver by Mr. Bourne, for the following reasons:
   First. The only power of steering by means of rudders must be on the
terminal barge of the train, and must consequently be slow and inefficient in

--directing the movements of the others.
   Second. The preceding vessel in an articulation not only tows the one
which comes after it, but also steers it, by the position which it assumes with
regard to it, and consequently in the tortuous channels and amid the cross
currents of the Ganges and Burhampootra, there w^ould be no power of inde-

pendent action, to allow each vessel to take care of itself.

   48. In the system of towing introduced by me in the 'Assam' steamer, and
--278 REPORT 1858.

now proposed for the Nautilus flotilla, the tug and tow-boats are to be con-
nected together in such a way that the pivot of the tugging post is placed at

least half the breadth before the stern of the steamer, while the tow-boat had
a second centre of motion, connected by a rigid spar with the pivot, and
situated at a point in advance of the cutwater. The tugging post or pivot
of the tow-boat is made in the form of a timber knee, placed as a bowsprit,
and provided with two rollers for supporting the connecting hawsers.

    49. There is by this means established between the various barges of a
river ti'ain, the only kind of connexion which admits of sufficient independent
action for each boat to guide itself in an emergency, and is at the same time
strong enough to withstand the strain thrown upon them.

   The steering»apparatus is also arranged with the view of independent action ;

each boat is to be provided with two rudders, oue occupying the position of
the dead-wood aft, and the other occupying that of the gripe, forward ; the
joint action of these balanced rudders enabling each boat to turn on the

centre of her length. By using the foremost rudder across the stem, the bow
of the boat can be made to follow the stern of the steamer without impeding
the movements of the latter to port or starboard, when turning herself.

   50. The rapidity with which a boat of this description can be manoeuvred

by means of fore-and-aft rudders is easily explained. When the stern rudder

only is used, the vessel turns upon a pivot situated a short distance forward
of the stern post ; while, if the bow rudder only is used, the boat tends to
turn on a pivot considerably abaft of the bow. Consequently when both

rudders are used simultaneously, the common centre of motion will be near

the middle of the length of the vessel; on trial, the 'Assam ' steamer turning

short round in 15 seconds,

   51. By turning on this centre it is evident that neither bow nor stern will
have as far to move in turning round as if the pivot were situated near either
of the extremities, as happens when only one rudder is used. The peculiarity
of the mode of connexion is, that while the radial spar, forked at one end.
prevents collision between the bow of the tow and the stern of the tug : the
distance between them can be at any time increased by means of the hawsers,

one of which belongs to each vessel, and by hauling up which the crews of

either boat can slack out or take in, as the occasion may require.
   52. Necessity for greater care as to displacement, weight of hidl, and capa-

bility for cargo at light draft oftoater. To be secured by a more correct and

--definite system of contracting for steamers, with specific calculated quatvtity,

by a tabular form of tender. From inattention to the necessity of obtaining

correct estimates as to the weight of the vessel and calculations of displace-
ment, the majority of the steamers sent from this country under terms of
general capability for the navigation of the Indian rivers, have been found
to draw a great deal more water than was either specified or contracted for.

   53. With the view of ensuring accuracy in this respect, I have used a form
of tender for quantities, that was submitted, for the consideration of the
contractors and shipbuilders with the view of facilitating the calculations of
the quantities to be inserted in the blank tabular form of tender.

   The quantities given were not intended to be taken as absolutely correct,
but only as approximations to be verified by the contractors themselves, who
were requested to state their own quantities with the same form and specific

detail.

   The calculation of the displacement, however accurate it may be, only

gives one of the elements for determining the draft and capability for dead-

weight cargo ; to arrive at anything like certainty with regard to these two
                                             ON RIVER STEAMERS.                                     279

essentials of river navigation, the xoeight of the vessel must be calculated with

the greatest care and minuteness.

54-. In the estimates received by the Assam Company for an iron tea-boat

of 75 feet in length and 12 feet in breadth, the weight of the hull appeared

to vary from 17 tons to 10 tons. Much of this was, no doubt, attributable

to variations in the thickness of the metal plates, prepared by different me-

thods of construction.

55. Tenders were sent to the office in the usual routine, and others were

requested by the Directors from experienced shipbuilders submitting a spe-

cification, and to some a tracing of the best boat employed by the Company,

with suggestions for increasing the length from 68 to 75 feet, with fittings

adapted to navigation by native crews. The five tenders received for the

iron hull packed for shipment varied from £300 to 72 per cent, increase of

cost, the former being the net price contracted for, tlie latter a price per

ton, builders' measurement, and not including pumps and capstan, these

admitting of an indefinite extra charge. The cost of the same vessel by the

two contractors would differ 100 per cent.

Having issued the construction form of tender, with specification, and

calculated quantities of displacement, weights, and capabilities for cargo,

they were verified and reconsidered, after consultation, by several experienced

shipbuilders, so as to secure a very great reduction in the weight of the hull,

and consequent increase of cargo at light draft: the contract price of different

builders only varied 4 per cent. The amended specifications also reduced

the weight of hull 25 per cent., increasing the capability for cargo at 2 feet

draft 50 per cent.

57. From careful observation, there are many experienced shipbuilders

and naval architects who are now competent to undertake contracts, not as

formerly, by register tonnage and nominal horse-power at so much per ton

of register, but in terms of capability and speed. Such we know to be the

case, and with admirable results, in Liverpool, London, the Clyde, and

other ports.

58. The exceeding diversity of opinion, and the anomalies of practice,

with regard to the requirements of steam-ships and mode of contracting for

them, may be accounted for by the fact, that the sudden demand for iron

steam-vessels called into existence a numerous body of what may be termed

Mushroom Marine Engineers, who had previously been employed as assistants

to engineers, boiler-makers, or contractors. It is to such men that we are

indebted for the luminous discussions on the " Formula " of resistanc, power,

and speed of steamers, one of whom propounded as a fixed princple, that

naval architects had nothing to do but provide displacement at a given area

of section, and that the speed did not depend on the form or lines of the

vessel ; also that displacement or friction of bottom very little affected the

resistance.

59. To such extent has this vague and indefinite style of reckoning pro-

ceeded, that there seems to be almost double entendre in everything con-

nected with the specification and contracting for steam-vessels. In the first

place, there are two meanings attached to the term " tonnage," the old and

the netu; then the enpfine-power is reckoned in nominal and effective horse-

power                              and  the  discrepancy  which  exists  between these  last-named  quan-
                                ;

tities is scarcely greater than what is found between the net contract price,

and that which, under accumulated impositions, might come under the name

of the commission price.

--280 REPORT 1858.

the cost of steam transit by the capital required to obtain a ton of capability
for cargo, is necessarily different from that in use, as with railway or canal
traffic in this country, viz. the cost of a ton per mile, from the absence of all
detail of the working expenses, and the conditions of Indian river naviga-
tion being so various and totally different from canal or even European river

navigation.

   The valuable paper read before this Section by Mr. W. H.Bartholomew,

the engineer of the Aire and Calder navigation, lucidly illustrated what
economic results had been obtained by the system of tug- and tow-boats.

   The extraordinary practical results shown by Mr. Bartholomew, are not

only honourable to those who, by the combination of practical experience
and scientific investigation, have conduced to such important improvements

in engines and mode of tugging, but afford the best encouragement to

others to persevering inquiry, with the hope of introducing these improve-

ments on the Indian rivers.

   The following is a summary of the practical results :

  A" screw steam-tug 64 feet by 11 feet, fitted with its screw and engines,

draws 8 or 12 tow-boats of a gross tonnage of 1240 tons, carrying 820 tons
of cargo 2| miles an hour. Pressure of steam 200 lbs. on the square inch.

Two screws on the same shaft, but working in a different plane of rotation,

making 180 revolutions per minute. Dynamical effect on tow-rope, 32 cwt.
consumption of coal 2 tons per day, of 10 working hours; draft of water,

6 to 7 feet."
    Towing cargo on the Humber, these screw tug-boats can tow and turn

eight to twelve barges ; experience showing that the addition of two or four
vessels reduced the speed very little in proportion to the increase of load, but

much depended on steady steering. While on the Bengal rivers, when towing

one very long vessel through the tortuous channels, it was found expedient
to lash her alongside, keeping their two rudders working together, whenever

--the length exceeded 1 80 feet.
    Conclusion. Having had, as commander, builder, and owner of steamers,
thirty years' practical experience in the establishing and working the earliest
systems of river and ocean steamers in Bengal and the eastern coast of India
 and retaining up to the present time a deep personal and pecuniary interest
 in several local enterprises depending on the development of river steam
navigation and maritime trade in Bengal ; having also had much experience
 as Director of companies in this country in contracting for engines and

--steamers to meet the requirements of the Indian ports, I believe that the

 present great difficulty of want of means of transit in India can only be over-
 come by the immediate construction of steam-tugs and tow-boats for railway^
 but separately for military and mercantile purposes.

    With a view to effective comparison of the money value of tenders and
 specifications for river steamers from different builders and contractors, I
 have used the following Table, by which the capital or cost per ton of capa-

 bility for weight-cargo can be ascertained at three drafts, as well as the
 three elements of resistance ; from these a scale or curve of displacement and
 areas can be formed, which with the indicated H. P. will afford the means of
 ascertaining the coefficient or index number of the vessel daily.

    REPORT 1858.

.

Repwt of the Belfast Dredging Committee. By George C. Hyndman,

For the purpose of carrying out the investigation of the Marine Zoology of
the coasts of Antrim and Down, the Committee named at the meeting of the
British Association held in Dublin last year proceeded to make arrange-
ments early in the present summer. Dr. Dickie and Edward Waller, Esq.,
repaired to Lame, county Antrim, where they remained for a fortnight

during the month of June, accompanied by the writer for the greater portion
of the time. Some difficulty was experienced from the want of boats and
boatmen. Eventually a yawl, with a crew of five men, was ordered from
Groomsport, county Down, and on the 23rd of June a steamer was hired
and brought from Belfast by Mr. Patterson.

   With these means for work, the following portions of the coast were

explored :

   1st. The shallow water lying between the small islands called " The
Maidens " and the shore as far north as Ballygalley Head.

   2nd. The northern shore of Island Magee, including Brown's Bay and
" The Cod-bank," lying north of the Isle of Muck.

   3rd. Larne Lough.
   4th. The deep water outside the Maidens' Lighthouses.
   5th. The Turbot-bank and the deep water adjacent.

  A small basketful of the sand procured from the Turbot-bank was for-

warded to J. Gwyn Jeffreys, Esq., and a list of its contents made out by

--him, amounting to 127 species of Testacea in that small quantity of sand.

Among these are several very rare shells a few of them new to the British

list, and several to the Irish.

   The weather was in general unfavourable, and interfered very much with
the operations. Among the submarine rocks off the Liglithouses, where the

depth was from 80 to 100 fathoms, the current ran with such strength and
rapidity that the dredges got foul several times, and were recovered with

great difficulty and loss of time. For further exploration in that quarter
some better mode of procedure would require to be adopted.

   Dr. Dickie having now been obliged to leave us for Aberdeen, Mr. Waller

took lodgings at Groomsport in order the better to continue the investiga-
tion, and, along with the writer, made a number of excursions in different

directions.

    1st. Across Belfast Bay, between the Copeland Islands on the south and

Black Head on the north.
    2nd. Outside the entrance of Belfast Bay, eastward, into 60 fathoms depth,

and across to the Copelands.

    3rd. Off Black Head and along the Gobbins as far as the Isle of Muck,

including the Turbot Bank.

   4th. The shores of the Copeland Islands and Groomsport, with the Sound
between the Islands and the coast of Down.

   A5th. submarine bank, composed of coarse stones, broken shells, and

mud, with a number of living MoUusca, lying south of the Copeland Islands,
a mile south of Donaghadee, and about a mile from shore, in 20 fathoms
water, and called "The Riggs" by the fishermen, who are in the habit of

setting their long lines there.

    From the extent of the area indicated by the boundaries above mentioned,

it must be evident that the portion passed over by our dredges must be
comparatively very small, and that the lists of species enumerated can only
be taken as an approximation to the whole number in the region. The

dead shells far exceed the living in number, the latter being for the most
part sparingly scattered, except in the case of a few gregarious species.

    Lists are appended of the species obtained from the different dredgings,
from which it will be seen that since last year the following have been

added :
                         A. Arctic. N. Northern. S. Southern.

S. Pholadidea papyracea. Discovered in the dredgings of 1857, imbedded in rolled lumps

        of hard clay, and again in the deep water this season. Recorded by the late W.

          Thompson as found at Portrush by the Ordnance Survey Collectors.

S. Lepton nitidum. Tutbot-bank sand, Mr. Waller ; new to the Irish list.
S, Montacuta ferruginosa. Turbot-bank sand,Mr.Waller. Recorded by the late W. Thomp-

           son, Dublin coast and south of Ireland.
S. Nucula tenuis. Li%-ing in deep water. Maidens, Mr. Hyndman. Recorded by the late

          AV. Thompson ; Mr. Warren, Portmarnock.
S. Argiope cistellula .', lining. This interesting addition to the Irish fauna was first dis-

         covered by Mr. Hyndman in the dredgings of 1857, and again taken by the party in

           1858. It seems to be abundant on dead bivalves incrusted with Serpulae.

    Terebratula capsula, living. This new species, taken with the foregoing, proves to be
         the same as the shell found by Mr. Norman at Plymouth, and named by Mr. Jeflreys

in the ' Annals of Nat. Hist.' for January 1859.

N. Margarita undulata (Sowerby). Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys ; new to the Irish list.

N. pusilla (  ). Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys ; new to the Irish list.

N, cinerea (Couthouy). Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys ; new to the Irish list.

Rissoa soluta. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

Skenea divisa. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.
Cerithium niveum (Loven), dead. This interesting addition to the British list was de-

     termined by Mr. Jeffreys from the Turbot-bank sand.
Scalaria Eschrichti (HolboU), dead. In Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Waller, 1857. Described

     by him in the ' Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society,' and named provisionally
     Turritella Hibemica, but now ascertained by Mr. Jeffreys to be the Scalaria men-
     tioned. Recently discovered by Mr. Jeffreys " in the collection of Mr. Maccullough of
    Guernsey, picked up on the beach at Herm together with other undoubtedly British

              shells."

N. Eulimella Scillse, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Waller and Mr. Hyndman.
              acicula, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Waller and Mr. Jeffreys.

Chemnitzia rufa, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

scalaris, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

interstincta, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

Odostomia dubia, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

---- nitida, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.
        rissoides, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

cylindrica, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

insculpta, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

decussata, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.
truncatula, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys. Plymouth Sound is the only

other known locality of this shell.

A. Natica clausa, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffi'eys.

A. Trophon scalariformis, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys ; new to the British list.

     Mangelia Trevelliana, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

           Leufroyi, dead, but very fresh. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Hyndman and Mr. Waller.

         scabra, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Jeffreys.

Buccinum cyaneum. A fragment only, considered by Mr. Jeffreys to be this species, in

Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Waller.

Cylichna mammiilata, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Waller.

unibilicata, dead. Turbot-bank sand, Mr. Waller.

   The interesting question, however, still remains undetermined, as to

whether these Northern species may be considered as still living in this

region, or as iiaving been washed out of some submerged pleistocene bed.

Upon this point I feel myself incompetent to offer a decided opinion without

further investigation, but would refer to the observations on the subject
published by Mr. Jeffreys in the ' Annals of Natural History ' for August

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              '

1858, and by Mr. Waller in the ' Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society

for March 1858. I may also quote an extract from a note of Mr. Jeffreys
of the 13th September, showing his latest views:--" I found, in the dredged
sand from the Turbot-bank, two or three shells or fragments which appear
to belong to Cerithium reticulatum ; but they are evidently fossil, and as
completely mineralized as a Euomphalus from the mountain-limestone.
This fact is interesting, and may be, I think, considered fair ground for an

inference that the other shells found with these fossils (being in a totally

different condition) are recent."
    Dr. Kinalian, of Dublin, having lately visited Belfast, took the oppor-

tunity of inspecting the late William Thompson's collection of Crustacea,

and some private collections. He has kindly furnished a list of the species

he observed, and corrected some mistakes in the names, and has also added
to our list a new Crangon, which he has named Pattersoiiii.

Turbot Bank. On the 22nd June some exploration was effected, and on

the 23rd a steamer was engaged from Belfast, when a quantity of material

was obtained from tiie Bank and the deep water adjacent. After the copious

list published in the Report of the British Association for 1857, it would be

needless to repeat the whole of the species obtained during the present

season                               but in  order to  show the richness of the deposit, a list is here given

 --a. Appendages of the Chains. The minimum sectional area of the chains

is the product of the breadth and thickness of the iron thereof in its smallest

dimensions. But the links of plate-chains overlap each other at their extre-
mities, which are enlarged and connected together by screw-ended short bolts
of large diameter, secured by nuts and keys ; these additions to the simple
chains constitute their appendages, and increase the weight (and consequently
the average sectional area) by about from 20 to 2.7 per cent, of the minimum
area. Where wire is employed for the suspension in the form of cables, the
appendages thereof will bear a very much smaller proportion than the above
to the minimum area, as they consist merely of the wrappings around the

steel strands of the cables.

  --b. Maximum Weight admitted on the Chains. The maximum weight or

strain on the chains or wire cables of suspension bridges, should not exceed
a fourth or a fifth of the breaking weight or strain, nor should it exceed
materially the half of that strain which would produce a permanent effect

upon the natural elasticity of the iron. The breaking weight or strain of
good wrought iron varies from 20 lbs. to as much as 28 lbs. (avoirdupois)
upon the square inch of the section of the bar. The strain which causes
wrought iron to take a permanent set (that is, which so stretches the fibres
of the iron that their elasticity is injured, whereby the iron no longer returns
to its normal length when the strain is taken off), varies from 10 lbs. to

14 lbs. per square inch. Consequently the expression (e) in the formula
ought not to be taken higher than from 5 lbs. to 7 lbs., or from 0*0022 ton

--to 0-0032 ton.

gj c. Load on the Chain. This quantity comprises the weight of the sus-

pension rods (dependent from the chains or cables, and from which the
platform of the bridge is suspended), also the weight of the roadway or plat-
form, and the greatest weight with which the platform can be loaded. These,
 together, constitute the load on the chaitis, exclusive only of the weight of

--these chains themselves and of their appendages.
    d. Dimensions of the Abutment. The heiglit or depth of the abutment is
 to be measured from the point on the outer face thereof, at which the chains
 enter therein ; and the length of the abutment is to be measured from that
 same point to the point at the opposite or inner side of the abutment to
                     --

 which the chains extend, and where they are attached or fastened by means
 of mooring-plates, abutting against this extreme end. The weight of the
abutment will be calculated from its dimensions, in proportion to the specific
 gravity of the material employed in its construction ; and the actual weight
 of the abutment, as built, should be from four to five times the theoretical
weight, determined by the formula, as that required to resist the tension,
exclusive of friction or surface-resistance. If the abutment should be sub-
jected to be surrounded by water, either constantly or periodically, the con-
sequent augmentation necessary in the dimensions and weight of the abut-
ment must be determined, in proportion to the depth of water in which it
may be submerged.

Report of the Joint Committee of the Royal Society and the British
    Association, for procuring a continuance of the Magnetic and

     Meteorological Observatories.

At the Meeting of the British Association, which was held at Dublin in

August 1857, a resolution was adopted, proposing the continuance of the
system of magnetical observations which was commenced under the auspices
of the Royal Society and of the British Association in 1840; and a Com-
mittee, consisting of the President of the Association, the Rev. Dr. Robinson,
and Major-General Sabine, was appointed, to request the cooperation of the
President and Council of the Royal Society in the endeavour to attain this
object, and to take, in conjunction with them, such steps as may appear

desirable for that end.

   The Committee thus appointed accordingly held a meeting in London, on
the 5th November last, at which it was agreed to recommend that hourly
observations, for not more than five years, should be undertaken at certain
stations in the British Colonies ; and a letter was addressed to the President

of the Royal Society, asking for his cooperation, and that of the Council of
the Society, in endeavouring to attain that object.

    This application was favourably received by the Council of the Royal
Society; and on the 10th of December, 1857, the following resolution was
adopted in reference to it :

   " That Sir John Herschel, the Astronomer Royal, the Dean of Ely, and
Dr. Whewell, be appointed a Committee, to cooperate with the Committee
appointed with this view by the British Association, and to take, in conjunc-
tion with them, such steps as may be necessary, including, if it be thought
desirable, an application to the Government."

   In consequence of this resolution, a correspondence took place among the
members of the two Committees, which having resulted, it is believed, in a
general agreement as to the course to be adopted, the joint Committee so

acting in cooperation met at Leeds on the 24th September, and in the first
instance proceeded to inquire into the nature and scientific value of the results
which have already been secured by the system of observation hitherto
carried out, at the observatories maintained by the Government, at the joint
recommendation of these two bodies ; with a view to forming a distinct opinion
whether they are such as to merit being regarded as a reasonable, and, what

may be called, a remunerative return for the labour and thought bestowed
upon them, and the very considerable expenditure of the public money

incurred by them. In so doing, they have limited their views to the results,
as^.ompared with the expenditure, in the British Colonial magnetic observa-

toriesonlj', without taking into consideration tliose deducible from observa-

tions made under foreign auspices; and they find that, at the cost of an
expenditure which may be reckoned at about j6400 per annum (exchisive

of the cost of instruments, outfit, and publication), for each of the several

observatories at St. Helena, Toronto, Hobarton, and the Cape of Good
Hope during the respective continuance of each, the accumulated observa-

tions, so far as they have yet been discussed, have produced the following
results, which they consider as satisfactorily established by the discussion:

   In the first place, the mean state of the several magnetic elements for each

of the stations, as reduced to a fixed epoch, has been obtained with a pre-

--cision of which nothing previously done has afforded any example emula-

ting, in this respect, the exactness of astronomical determinations, and com-

--petent to serve as a fixed point of departure, to the latest ages ; and this for

each of the elements in question the dip, the declination, and the intensity
of the magnetic force.

    Secondly, that at each station, the rate of regularly progressive secular
change in all the three elements above-mentioned has been ascertained with
a degree of precision which contrasts strongly with the loose and inaccurate
determinations of former times.

    Thirdly, that the laws of the diurnal, annual, and other periodic fluctua-
tions in the values of these elements, as exhibited at each station, have been
established in a manner and with a decision to which nothing hitherto
executed in any branch of science, astronomy excepted, is comparable ; and
that the results embodied in the examination of these laws have laid open a
view of magnetic action so singular, and so utterly unexpected, as to amount
to the creation of a new department of science, and the detection of a com-
pletely novel system of physical relations : for that, in the first place, the
systems of diurnal and annual magnetic changes have each been separated

--into two perfectly distinct and physically independent systems, the one, at

any particular station, holding its course according to laws depending solely

on the sun's hour-angle at the moment of observation, and his meridian
altitude at different seasons ; the other comprehending all those movements
which, under the name of magnetic storms, or " irregular disturbances," have
hitherto presented the perplexing aspect of phenomena purely casual,
capricious in amount and in the particular occasions of their occurrence
when regarded singly, has been shown, by these discussions, to be subject
in its totality to laws equally definite with the others, though more dependent
for their application on peculiarities of local situation. As regards the first

of these systems of fluctuation, they find it demonstrated :
    That the sun's regular action on the magnetism of the globe is deter-

mined by a law of no small complexity and intricacy, but which, nevertheless,
has been traced with precision and certainty, and shown to be referable, in
the first place, and for one of its arbitrary coefficients, to the geographical
situation of the place of observation with respect to a certain line or equator
on the earth's surface, which caunot yet be precisely traced for want of
sufficiently numerous stations (but which seems to approach to the line of

--least intensity and is very far from coinciding with the geographical equator),
    and in the next, and for its other influential cause, to the fact of the
sun's having north or south declination ; so that the whole diurnal change
in any one of the elements, and at any station, is made up of two portions,
one of which retains the same sign, and a constant coefficient all the year
round ; the other changes sign, and varies in the value of its coefficient with
the annual movement of the sun from one side of the equator to the other.

    That, consequently, for a station on the magnetic equator (so defined),
                                                                           ;

       MAGNETIC AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORIES. 297

the mean amount of diurnal change is 7iil, when taken over the whole year

but that on any particular day in the year it has a determinate magnitude,

which passes through an annual periodicity, with opposite characters iu

opposite seasons; and that for a station in middle latitudes the mean

diurnal fluctuation is not 7ul, but sucli as during every part of the year to

exhibit an easterly deviation in the morning hours, and a westerly in the

evening hours, for stations north of the magnetic equator, and vice versa

for those south of it ; but tliat the amount of tliis deviation, or the amplitude

of the diurnal fluctuation, varies witii tlic seasons, being exaggerated or

l^artially counteracted by the alternate consjtiring and opposing influence of

the sun's declination during the summer and winter seasons.

As regards the irregular disturbiinces, though arbitrary and capricious in

extent and in the moments when they may be expected individually, this

does not prevent their obeying W'ith great fidelity the law of averages wiieu

grouped in masses and treated separately from those of the former class.

So handled, they are found to conform in the average effect, at each of the

twenty-four hours of the day, and on each day of the year, to the very same

--rules as regards the sun's daily anrl annual movement, with one remarkable

point of difference : viz., tiiat their hours of maxima and minima arc not

identical with those of the regular class, but that each particular station

has, in this respect, its own peculiar hours, analogous to what is called the

" establishment " of a port in the theory of the tides ; and that, in con-

sequence, the superposition of these two systems of diurnal fluctuation gives

rise to a scries of compound variations analogous to the superposition of two

undulations having the same period but different amplitudes and different

epochal times, and that, by attending to this principle, many of the most

complex phsenomena, such as that of a double maximum and minimum, with

the occurrence of a nightly as well as a daily movement, are explained in a

satisfactory manner.

The discussion of the observations already accumulated has further

brought into view, and in the opinion of your Committee fully established,

the existence of a very extraordinary periodicity in the extent of fluctuation

of all the magnetic elements, and in the amplitude and frequency of their

irregular movements especially, which connects them directly with the

--physical constitution of the sun, and with the periodical greater or less

prevalence of spots on its surface, the maxima of the amount of fluctuation

corresponding to the maxima of the spots, and these, again, with those of

--the exhibitions of the Aurora Borealis, which appears also to be subject to

the same law of periodicity a law which, as it does not agree with any of
the otherwise known solar, lunar, or planetary periods, may be considered as,

so to speak, personal to the sun itself. And thus we find ourselves landed

in a system of cosmical relations, in which both the sun and the earth, and

probably the whole planetary system, are implicated.

   That the sun acts in influencing the earth's magnetism in some other
manner than by its heat, seems to be rendered very probable by sevgral

features of this inquiry; and the idea of a direct magnetic influence ext

                                                                                                                                                                            j|jg

to the earth is corroborated by the discovery of a minute fluctuation in

magnetic elements, having for its period not the solar but the lunar day, ^fid

therefore directly traceable to the action of the moon. The detection of

this fluctuation by Mr. Kreil, from a discussion of the Prague observations,

has been confirmed by the evidence afforded by those of our Colonial

observatories, and appears to be placed beyond all question by the recent

deductions for the horizontal force and the declination, extending over three

years of observation at the Cape of Good Hope, which General Sabine has

submitted for your Committee's inspection, and in both vvhicb the fluctua-
tions in question emerge in a very satisfactory manner, and one calculated
to give a high idea of the precision of which such determinations are
susceptible, when it is considered that the total amplitude of oscillation due
to this cause in tlie direction of the Cape-needle is only about 18" of angle.

    Your Committee, looking at this long catalogue of distinct and positive
conclusions already obtained, feel themselves fully borne out in considering
that the operation in a scientific point of view has proved so far eminently
remunerative and successful, and that its results have fully equalled in im-
portance and value, as real accessions to our knowledge, any anticipations
which could reasonably have been formed at the commencement of the

inquiry.

    Having satisfied themselves of the great and important value of the results
already obtained, independent of the dormant interest as respects future dis-
cussion which the mass of observations accumulated continues to possess,
and which it remains for future theoretical combinations to elicit, your
 Committee next turned their attention to the question whether, and to what
extent, the maintenance of some or all of the old Colonial observatories, or the
establishment of new ones for a limited term, might be expected, first, to give
 additional certainty and precision to the determinations already obtained,
and secondly to elucidate points imperfectly made out, and more especially
 geographical relations whicli determine the greater or less amount of dis-
 cordance between the epochal hours of the regular and irregular diurnal

--changes relations wliich, no doubt, involve the causes of the irregular

 fluctuations themselves (causes at present involved in the greatest ob-

--scurity) and to obtain indications of the points in the earth's surface at

 which the forces producing them originate.

    As regards the general question as to the desirableness of some continua-

--tion of the observations, its seems hardly to be referred to our consideration

 as a Committee, the resolutions come to both by the British Association
 and by the Council of the Royal Society, in the appointment of their
 respective Committees of co-operation, indicating an opinion already con-
 clusively formed on the part of both bodies to that effect. They have felt
 it due to themselves, however, to come to an independent conclusion on that
 point; and having done so with perfect unanimity, on the grounds already
 adduced and the expectations for the future which those grounds justify,
 they next address themselves to the consideration of the two points above
 indicated, and to the important questions, first, whether to recommend the

 continuance or resumption of the establishments at the former stations, or

 the selection of new ones; and secondly, with how few new or revived
 establishments, with how limited a scale as to extent and expense, and with
 how short a period as the minimum term of their duration, the expecta-

 tion of these advantages being secured could be compatible ; and finally to
 fix upon the stations most desirable.

    As regards the first point referred to, viz. the more complete establish-
 ment of tlie laws themselves, and the giving of greater numerical precision

 to their expression, the Committee is of opinion that the laws themselves
 are not likely to be subverted or contradicted by a larger series of observa-
 tions at any station for which they have once been shown to prevail ; but

 that every new station differing much in geographical situation from the

' former in which they might be found verified with or without supple-
 mentary modifications, would undoubtedly add strength to the induction by
 which they have been concluded. Additional immerical precision, on the
 other hand, would only be attained by a continuance of observations at
          MAGNETIC AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORIES. 299

former stations, and is not a point of sufficient importance, in their opinion,

--to be entitled to any weight in opposition to considerations in favour of

change, while in the one important case in which such additional precision
is especially desirable, that of the solar period, such additional precision
will be acquired ultimately as a matter of course by continued observation
at any one of the existing permanent observatories, of whose business mag-
netic observation forms a part, as well as by any amount of Colonial esta-

blishments.

    It is therefore mainly in the elucidation of obscure and difficult physical
points, and in the probable extension of our knowledge of the geographical
and other conditions on which the irregular disturbances depend, that our

--hope of advantage from further observation consists, our conviction being

that, without special observations at well-selected stations (selected, that
is, with a view to these objects), there is little or no prospect of further pro-

gress. The general character of the magnetic phenomena may be con-

sidered as secured from loss ; but the great problem remains unresolved ;
the local influences are yet to trace ; and the only means of tracing them must
consist in varying the position of our stations so as to embrace great dif-
ferences in geographical situation, and in conformity with such indications

as can be gathered from our present experience. The magnetic establish-
ments permanently existing in Europe and America are confessedly inade-
quate to afford the requisite information. The stations which have occurred
to your Committee as most eligible would be Vancouver Island, New-
foundland, the Falkland Isles, Bermuda, Ceylon, Shanghai or some locality
in China, and Mauritius; but they are fully aware that to demand from

 the national purse the institution of observations at all these points,

would be more than is warranted by any pressing necessity, and ought

therefore not to be insisted on. Among them, the principal in point of

 interest (for reasons which will be presently mentioned) are Vancouver
 Island, Newfoundland, the Falkland Isles, and Pekin or some near adjacent

 Chinese station, such as Shanghai ; and the Committee consider that much

 valuable information Avould accrue from observations sufficiently prolonged at
 these, to which, therefore, they would be understood to limit their recom-
 mendation. In regard to the length of time over which they would desire to
 see the observations extended, they consider five years (being about half the
 solar period, and being also sufficient to give a fair grasp of the secular
 change of the magnetic elements) as a period both in consonance with that
 which has been accorded on former occasions, and in some sort designated
 by the nature of the case.

    The reasons which induce them to give a preference to these over the rest

--of the stations enumerated are as follows : Between Toronto and Point

 Barrow the difference of the epochal hours of the irregular diurnal fluctua-

--tions is such as to amount to a complete opposition of phases, a circumstance

  vviiich goes far to point out the latter station as being in the immediate neigh-
 bourhood of the origin of those irregular disturbances. Should observations

 be established at the two stations now proposed, there is every reason to hope,
 as will appear from a document drawn up at the request of the Committee

  by General Sabine, and with his permission appended to this Report, that the
  observations at Toronto, which have been partially re-established since 1855,
  would, with a view to cooperation for this especial purpose, be wholly resumed

 on a fitting application to the Colonial legislature. And in addition to this,
  should an application made to the Norwegian Government for the esta-

  blishment, during the same period, of an observatory at the North Cape prove
  successful (which there is every reason to hope, such an application made on

                                                                        x2

a former occasion having been well received and having ultimately failed

owino- only to a want of attention to some point of ciiplomatic form in its mode
of communication), we slionld then have a chain of stations in high northern
latitude:-., the results obtained at which, being severally brought into com-
parison with those already procured at Point Barrow, and with each other,
could hardly fail of bringing out some very positive conclusion.

   As reoards the proposal for a station at the Falkland Isles, it is presumed,
from the general course of the magnetic line of minimum intensity, that this
station will prove, in analogy to the Cape of Good Hope, and in contrast with
t!ie northern stations recommended, to have the character of an equatorial, or
approximate equatorial station ; and in respect to tiiat proposed in China, that

--it will complete and carry round the globe the cliain of northern middle-lati-

tude stations, the intermediate links being supplied by the Russian observa-

tories, and by those which it is hoped may be established at the North Cape and
at Vancouver Island. As regards the Falkland Isles and Newfoundland, it

should be noticed that there exist considerable facilities and conveniences for
the comfortable establishment of an observatory there; and in respect of the

other two, it may be remarked that they arc both points of great present

interest, and that a determination of the meteorological as well as magnetic

peculiarities of both would be important. The affections of a telegraphic
wire by electric discharges in the nature of Aurora Borealis have already

attracted attention, and produced confusion in the ordinary use of such wires,
and constitute one of the motives for inquiry into the nature and laws of the

so-called magnetic storms. It may also be observed that, in reference to

the anomalistic equation of the sun's magnetic intensity, or the effect of its
annual approach and recess due to the ellipticity of the earth's orbit, the
influence of local temperature upon the observations requires to be elimi-
nated, in order to bring this effect into evidence, by a combination of the
results obtained at stations whose seasons are opposite.

   In reference to the important consideration of keeping down as much as

possible the outlay consequent on the establishment of these observatories,

your Committee have given attention to the question whether it be desirable

--to continue, as heretofore, the printing of the observations iti extenso

measure resulting in the production of vast and costly volumes, and entailing
a great amount of laborious superintendence. They consider that, the form
of the observations remaining unaltered, and the principles of their reduction

being now rendered familiar, this would not be necessary, provided the

original observations were registered in triplicate, and the copies separately
deposited in diff'erent and secure custody for preservation and occasional
reference when required, and provided that sufficient and well-digested

abstracts of their reduced results were published. One series of observations,

however, they consider must be excepted from this alteration of system :

those of a continuous nature, made on term days, four of which per annum

they desire to see still kept up ; and those taken on occasions of magnetic
storms, when continuous observation is substituted for that on the regular

hourly intervals : for the treatment of such observations is still a matter of
scientific inquiry ; and to render them available in comparison with others,

the complete register is indispensable.

   Your Committee cannot but contemplate a revival of active interest and
cooperative participation in the system of observation, on the part of our
Colonial and of Foreign Governments, when once it shall become known

that the subject is resumed by our own Home Government in the manner
recommended. On this subject they beg to refer to Gen. Sabine's reply to

their inquiries, already alluded to, which places in a distinct point of view
MAGNETIC AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSEKVATORIES. 301

the expectations which may justly be indulged on that score. In reference,

moreover, to tlie personal and material establishment at each of the Govern-
ment observatories, this document contains a summary of what is needed,

and of what ought to be applied for.                                             ^

                                                    _
And tills leads your Committee to a point which they consider of such

importance to the success of the whole proceeding, that they cannot help

enibodyinc their opinion on it in this Report. It is of little avail to accu-

mulate observations unless their effective aiul complete reduction be provided

for, and the assurance obtained that when reduced they will undergo sucii
discussion and scientific treatment as shall elicit from them the laws of the

phenomena of which they are the records. The zeal and ability with whicii

the present Superintendent of the Government Magnetic and Meteorological
Observatories has hitherto executed this task, if extended to the new series

now called for, would aflbrd that assurance in its fullest extent ; and they

earnestly trust that this will not be lost sight of in liie arrangements to be

made in carrying out their proposals, if adopted.

There is another point to which your Committee consider their attention

--ought to be i)aid sinmltaneously with the establishment of the proposed ob-

servatories : it is that of the extension of Magnetic Surveys of tiie districts

in their immediate neighbourhood, with a view to fixing tiie situation and

direction of the iso-masjnetic curves within some considerable adjoining

area (in the case of the Falkland Isles, that of the wliole group).

On this point the following remarks by General Sabine, in a communica-

tion addressed by him to us in reply to certain inquiries which we considered

it right to make of him, are, in the opinion of your Committee, conclusive in
deciding them to recommend that provision be also made for the execution

of such survej's, collaterally with the observations at the fixed stations.

" Recent observations in North America, discussed in the proceedings of

the Royal Society for January 7th, 1858, have made known that the general

movement of translation of the isoclinal and isogonic lines, which from the

earliest observations have been progressing from West to East, has within a

few years reached its extreme eastern oscillation, and that the movement in

the reverse direction has already commenced ; we live therefore at an epoch

in the history of terrestrial magnetism which we have reason to believe will

-- --be regarded hereafter when theory shall have more advanced as a highly

important and critical epoch. The geographical position of the maximum

force in the Northern Hemisphere appears to have reached its extreme
easterly elongation, and from this time forth may be expected to move for

many years to come towards the meridian which it occupied in Halley's time,

accompanied by a corresponding change in the positions and forms of the

isodynamic, isoclinal, and isogonic lines in North America; a careful de-

termination of the absolute values and present secular change of the three

elements at this critical theoretical epoch, at stations situated at either side

of tlie American continent, and nearly in the geographical latitude of the

maximum of the force, would furnish therefore data for posterity, of the

value of which we may have a very inadequate appreciation at present. I

may refer to the discussion prefixed to the third volume of the Toronto Ob-
servations, to show that the means and methods with whicii we are conversant
are adequate for the purpose, and I may indicate Vancouver Island and

Newfoundland as colonies well suited for establishments of the same nature

as those of which the efficiency has been proved."

As regards the instrumental means to be employed, the Committee believe

that the consideration of the subject would be more fitly undertaken by the

Royal Society, who will probably think it right to appoint a special committee^
                           --  --

--302 REPORT 1858.

as was done on the former occasion, to consider it maturely, nnd to report
upon it. Well as, in general, the instruments employed in the British colonial

observatories have perrormed, it may be desirable to consider whether they

could not be improved, by diminishing considerably the size of the magnetic
bars employed. Small bars indicate more certainly the rapid magnetic

changes; they may be hardened more perfectly, and therefore vary less in

their magnetic condition with changes of temperature ; they admit of more
perfect protection from the effects of disturbing aerial currents ; and finally,

the instruments may be constructed at less expense, and may be grouped

together in a smaller and less costly building.
   The joint committee therefore have finally agreed to the following resolu-

tions, which they submit for approval to their respective appointing bodies :
    1. That it is highly desirable that a series of magnetical and meteorological

observations, on the same plan as those which have been already carried on
in the colonial observatories for that purpose, under the direction of H.M.
JJoard of Ordnance, be obtained, to extend over a period of not more than

five years, at the following stations :

                                    1. Vancouver Island.

                                     2. Newfoundland.

                                 3. The Falkland Isles.
                                   1<, Pekin, or some near adjacent station.

   2. That an application be made to her Majesty's (Government, to obtain

the establishment of observatories at these stations for the above-mentioned
term, on a personal and material footing, and under the same superintendence,

as in the observatories (now discontinued) at Toronto, Gt. Helena, and Van

Diemen Island.
   3. That the observations at the observatories now recommended should be

comparable with and in continuation of those made at the last-named obser-

vatories, including four days of term-observations annually.

   4. That provision be also requested at the hands of Her Majesty's Govern-
ment, for the execution, within the period embraced by the observations, of

--magnetic surveys in the districts immediately adjacent to those stations viz.

of the whole of Vancouver Island and the shores of the strait sei)arating
it from the main land, of the Falkland Isles, and of the immediate neigh-

--bourhood of the Chinese observatory (if practicable) wherever situated on

the plan of the surveys already executed in the British possessions in North

America and in the Indian Archipelago.
   5. That a sum of £3.50 per annum, during the continuance of the obser-

vations, be placed by Government at the disposal of the General Superin-
tendent, for the purpose of procuring a special and scientific verification and
exact correspondence of the magnetical and meteorological instruments, both
of those which shall be furnished to the several observatories and of those

which, during the continuance of the observations for the period in question,

shall be brought into comparison with them either at Foreign or Colonial

stations.

   6. That the printing of the observations in extenso be discontinued, but
that provision be made for their printing in abstract, with discussion, but that
the term-observations, and those to be made on the occurrence of magnetic

--storms, be still printed in extenso ; and that the registry of the observations

be made in triplicate one copy to be preserved in the ofhce of the General
Superintendent, one to be presented to the Royal Society, and one to the

Koyal Observatory at Greenwich, for conservation and future reference.
   7. That measures be adopted for taking advantage of whatever disposition

may exist ont he part of our Colonial Governments to establish observatories
                                         ,;

           MAGNETIC AND METBOROLOGIOAL OBSERVATORIES. 303

of the same kind, or otherwise to co-operate with the proposed system of

observation.

   8. That in placing these resolutions and the report of the Committee before
the President and Council of the Royal Society, the continued co-operation of

that Society be requested in whatever ulterior measures may be requisite.

   9. That the President of the British Association be requested to act in
conjunction with the President of the Royal Society, and with the members
of the two Committees, in any steps which may appear necessary for the
accomplishment of the objects above stated.

   10. That an early communication be made of this procedure to His Royal

Highness the Prince Consort, the President elect of the British Association

for the ensuing year.

                                         St. Leonard's, June 26th, 1858.

My dear Sir,

              You wish me to state for the consideration of the Committee

what specific measures for the continuance and extension of magnetical re-

searches appear to me suitable to the present state of that branch of science,

and at the same time sufficiently moderate and reasonable to justify the ex-

pectation that the portion of them which requires it may receive the sanction

of Her Majesty's Government.

For this purpose it may be convenient to divide the subject generally

under three heads, and to consider separately what may be expected,
                              1st. From our own Government;

              2nd. From our own Colonies

              3rd. From foreign Countries.

1st. From our own Government.

The establishment, for a limited period, of Observatories in tlie three

colonies,

              Vancouver Island,

              Newfoundland,

              The Falkland Islands

on a similar plan to those which were established at Toronto, St. Helena,

and Hobarton, and which have now ceased, having accomplished their objects,
The " personnel " at each of these three observatories to consist of an officer,

four non-commissioned officers, and one private, either of the Artillery or of
the Engineers, with the same extra pay and allowance for incidentals as was

the case in the observatories which have terminated. The instruments, both
absolute and differential, to be of the same description as before, with of

course such modifications and improvements as experience has suggested.

The instruments to be prepared at Kew, and the directors of the three
observatories to be instructed there. The system of observation to be hourly,
Sundays, Christmas-days, and Good Fridays excepted. The time to be era-
ployed to be mean astronomical time at the station, both for magnetism and
meteorology. The observatories to be maintained until five complete years
of observation are obtained. The number of term-days in each year to be

reduced from twelve to four.

   The public departments whose sanction will be required are, the Treasury
for the expense, and the General Commanding in Chief for the selection and
appointment of the officers and non-commissioned officers. In addition to

the officer for each observatory, a fourth officer \y}ll b^ rf(jmired as ^n assi^tapt

 to the general Superintendent, in carrying on, under his direction, the details
 of correspondence with the observatories. Total, four officers, twelve non-
 commissioned officers, and three privates.

    2nd. With reference to our oion Colonies.

    As soon as the sanction of Government lias been obtained for the observa-

tories already named, the governors of British Guiana, Mauritius, and Mel-

bourne may bo written to, suggesting tiiat a communicatitni should bo ad-

dressed from each of those colonies to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
expressing the desire which is felt in the colony to participate in the proposed
systematic researches, stating wiiat facilities can be afforded, and what portion
of the expense can be borne by the colony itself, and requesting to be placed
in official communication with some suitable authority for the preparation of

instruments, and for furnishing such instruction and advice as may be

 required.

    Tiie accompanying letter from Lieutenant-Governor Walker, of British
Guiana, to Mr. Sandeman (which has been just forwarded to me), will show

how ready that colony is to take its part, and tiiat it waits only for that

measure of countenance and encouragement which it reasonably expects, and
ought to receive, from the mother country. At Mauritius, a Meteorological
Society formed by the colonists themselves is most actively and usefully
employed in tracing out, by means of the logs of merchant vessels, the phaj-
nomena of the storms by which navigation in that vicinity is troubled, and
is making most pressing appeals for an authorization which should enable

--them to add researches in magnetism to those in meteorology, having on the

spot, in Captain Fyers of the Royal Engineers, a person who would make an
admirable director of such an establishment. At Melbourne, a proposition
for a magnetic observatory and survey is now before the local government;
means are abundant, but instruments and direction are wanting. Mr. Jeffery,

so well trained in the Hobarton observatory, is in that country, and is desirous

of such employment, as M. Neumayer is of being engaged in the survey.
Melbourne would be a most important station for a magnetic observatorj', as
we might expect from it the verification or otherwise of the increase in the
magnetism of the earth, at the period of the year when she makes her nearest

approach to the sun.

   Other Colonies might follow the example ; but in regard to these three we

are justified in expecting that, with suitable measures of encouragement,

we should have thoroughly efficient establishments, carrying out the system

of observation in its completeness.
    3rd. With reference to foreign countries.

  A proposition has recently been made to the Netherlands' Government, by

Dr. Buys Ballot (who fills the same official position in Holland that Admiral
FitzRoy does in this country), for the establishment of a magnetic observa-
tory in the Dutch Colony of Batavia ; and Dr. Buys Ballot has written to
inquire wiiether, in the event of the proposition being acceded to, two sets of
instruments, one for Batavia and the other for Utrecht, could be prepared at

Kew. An intimation that the British Government was about to resume and

extend its magnetical researches might be expected to have a favourable in-
fluence on the success of Dr. Buys Ballot's proposition, and might also lead to
the adoption of our colonial system of observation in its full extent at the
Batavian observatory.

   The importance of the North Cape of Europe as a magnetical station,
especially with reference to the connexion between the Aurora and the mag-
netic disturbances, has already been noticed in a preceding letter from me (that

of May 13). The instruments which were prepared some years ago at the ex-
         MAGNETIC AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORIES. 305

pense of the Uoyal Society, and were intended to be presented to the observa-
tory at the North Cape (should one be established there by the Norwegian
Government), are still in existence, and with a few modifications might be

applied to their original purpose. The re-establishment of magnetic observa-

tories in the British Colonies might furnish a favourable occasion for reviving,

in concert with M. Han.^tcen, a proposition for an observatory at the North

Cape, wliich seems to have failed on the former occasion rather from an
accident than from any real difficulty in the matter itself.

   M. Secchi, of the Observatory of the Coilegio Romano, at Rome, has
recently been supplied from Kew, at the expense of tlie Papal Government,
with a complete equipment of magnetical instruments, similar to those which
have done such good work in the British Colonial establishments. With the
encouragement derived from the revival of active measures here, M. Secchi
might hope to obtain the aid which he desires, in the way of temporary
assistance, to enable him to carry out the complete system of observation for

wiiich he is already provided with the instrumental means.

   The concert which has prevailed between Russia and England in magnetic
operations gives reason to hope that renewed activity here might so far
strengthen M. Kupffer's hands as to enable him to carry out efficiently the

liourly system of the three elements, at one at least of the stations in Eastern
Siberia, the probable importance of which can scarcely be overrated.

  A meteorological observatory has recently been instituted at Havana ; and

the director, M. Poey, has proposed to the Cuban authorities the purchase
of magnetical instruments, to be prepared at Kew, and a sufficient increase of
assistants to provide for observations to be made with them. M. Poey is

active and intelligent, and has recently visited the principal magnetic institu-

tions in Europe. He would not fail to avail himself of the support which

Ids proposition would derive from the measures which might be taken here.

   The Regents of the Smithsoninn Institution at Washington have agreed to

allot a portion of their funds to a magnetic observatory ; but neither the
instruments nor the system of observation have yet been determined : their
decision might probably be hastened by the knowledge that active measures
are in progress here.

   Viewing the necessity of resorting to means of securing and ascertaining a
precise correspondence between the magnetical and meteorological instruments
which may come to be used in these operations, or in cooperation with them in
other quarters, as well as their exact and scientific adjustment, as also of se-
curing a self-registered series of photographic delineations of the solar spots
during their continuance, it is proposed that, during the continuance of the
observatories, an annual sum, not exceeding £350, should be taken on the

Description of a Self-recording Anemometer. By R, Beck ley,
  Assistant at the Kew Observatory of the British Association,

In all cases in which the system of hemispherical cups (devised by Dr.
Robinson as a measurer of the velocity of the wind) has been used, the
direction-apparatus has required a distinct support on the exterior of the

building. In my arrangement, a cast-iron tubular support (fig. 1, Plate XIX.)

carries the whole of the external parts of the instrument, which can be easily
adapted to any form of building upon which it is desirable to mount it.

   The general arrangement will be better understood by reference to

fig. 3, PI. XIX., showing the same in section.

   Upon the wind moving the cups, motion is given to the tubular shaft

a a a, the lower end of which is provided with an endless screw q, that works
into the worm-wheel a, fig. 1, PI. XX.: thence motion is communicated to

the registering pencil A.

The/a« or -loindmill goveriior was first used by Mr. Osier for indicating

the direction of the wind, owing to its steadiness compared to a vane. I

have therefore adopted it, but use two, D, D, fig. 2, Pi. XIX., fixed directly

on to the worm-spindle A, working into the fixed wheel B ; by this arrange-

ment a countershaft is dispensed with. The bearings of the worm spindle

A run upon four rollers, n, n, n, n, fig. 3, PI. XIX., contained in the boxes c, c,
Afig. 2, PI. XIX.  section of the box and rollers is shown at fig. 4-, PI. XIX.

The action of the fans is to keep their axis at right angles to the direction

of the wind ; any change taking place, they right themselves, carrying with

them the outer brass tube b b, fig. 3, PI. XIX., which is screwed to a long

tubular fitting of cast iron, e c, the lop of which is formed to receive the

friction-balls t, t, and with a shoulder which bears upon the friction-

balls u, XI. To the lower end of this fitting is fastened the necessary length

of brass tubing, g g, completing the direction-shaft, on the lower end of
which is a mitre wheel, c, fig 2, PI. XX.

The method of registration consists in using De la Rue's metallic paper,

this paper having the property of receiving a trace from a brass pencil.

Pencils can therefore be made of any form desired.

   In the first instrument made by Mr. Adie, of 39,5 Strand, from my

drawings, the velocity is registered by motion being given to the segment of

teeth A, fig. 4, PI. XX., taking into two racks, B, B, alternately, each traverse

being equal to fifty miles of horizontal movement of the air, the pencil being

inserted in the eye C ; and the direction of the wind is registered by a spiral,

of such a figure that equal angles correspond to equal increments of arc D,

fig. 4, PI. XX., which is in fact a screw upon a plane, on the edge of which is

screwed a thin strip of brass, E. This, being kepi against the paper by a

spring, forms the direction-pencil.

    In the instruments recently made, I have placed the strip of brass or pencil

round the cylinders A and B, fig. 2, PI. XX., making a very thin-threaded

--screw% the advantages of such an alteration being that the point of contact

of two cylinders is less than in the case of a cylinder and a plane, and
then requires no spring or appliances to keep them up to their work.

  --In reference to the figures 1, 2, and 3, PI. XX. Tiie worm-wheel a, fig. 1,

is moved one tooth by each revolution of the hemispherical cups, and is jjro-

vided with such a number of teeth that one whole turn is equal to one mile

of movement of the air. On the same axis is a mitre wheel, e, working into
its fellow, e, fixed on and giving motion to the inclined worm shaft /,
which works into the worm wheel g, having fifty teeth, one whole turn being
                                      ;

ON A SELF-RECORDING ANEMOMETER,  307

equal to fifty miles of wind. On the same fitting, and moving with it, is the

wheel i, working into its fellow/, which is fixed on and gives motion to the

Aaxis of the screw-poncil cylinder : these wheels are kept in gear by the

radial arms o, o. Tlie pitch of screw for the velocity-pencil is equal to a

scale of fifty miles upon the paper on the cylinder C. By this method I get

a very open scale within a small space-

   Any ciiange in the direction of the wind is communicated to the mitre

wheels c, c, fig. 2, PI. XX., fixed to the shaft K, on the other end of which is
the wheel/; from this, by two others, nt, m', a corresponding motion is given
to the wheel ?i, fixed on the axis of the screw-pencil cylinder B, 1 found it
better to introduce the small wheels ni, m, running on studs in the shifting arm
P, for the direction-pencil, as the motion is variable. The pitch of the screw is
equal to a scale of the cardinal points of the compass upon the paper.

    While these pencils are being acted upon by the wind, the clock gives a

--uniform motion of I in. per hour to the cylinder C, upon which the jjaper is

fastened, in connexion with which I beg to say that, as the clock must be
wound up daily, and as the time occupied in changing the paper is not
more than two or three minutes, I think it better to do so than to have a
continuous roll of paper lasting many days, which certainly is not so conve-

nient for reference as the daily record of 12 inches by 8 inches.

   By using the spiral form of pencil, I overcome the trouble attending the
old method, viz. the pencil shifting off the scale. To ensure registration, it is

 usual to have three scales upon llie paper, and set the pencil on the centre
but even then, should the wind shift twice round in one direction, it ceases to

indicate : by my method it must at all times register upon the one scale.
Fig. 5, PI. XX., is a copy of a sheet from the Kew Observatory, in which the

 advantage is evident.

    In conclusion, I would suggest that as the pencils are kept upon the paper
 by their own gravity, requiring no attention and being as long as the trace
 they make, they will last a long time. The space required for the instrument
 not being more than 18 inches x 8 inclies, I should recommend itsbeing placed
 upon a bracket as close to the roof of the building as convenient, similar to
 the anemometer at Kew, it being very advantageous to keep the shaft as short

 as possible.

                                                            Section,

The managers of the Association have assigned a small room to this Section. I

hope that no one is at present inconvenienced by this. I shall be glad if it should

be found that in this respect the managers have been mistaken. But the fact is,

that we are very much in the habit in this Section of treating our subjects in so

sublime a manner that we tliin the room very speedily. This is true, but this is no

Wefault of ours.  seek the laws of Nature, and Nature presents to us her laws in

a form which is to many persons repulsive, namely, a mathematical form. It has

been truly said, both by sacred and profane writers, that all things are made by

number, weight, and measure. Now things which happen by number, weight, and

measure, happen according to mathematical laws, according to the relations of

number and space. According to such relations the laws of various of the appear-

ances which Nature presents to us were studied at the earliest periods of the intel-

lectual progress of man; and if the laws detected by man on such subjects are in

some respects perplexing to many from their mathematical form and complexitv,

and are thus repulsive, they are at least attractive in another point of view ; for

the extent and brilliancy of the success which has been obtained in these fields

of speculation are such as could not have been in any degree anticipated at an

early period. And the truths obtained in this way at an early period of man's

intellectual progress are even still of great value and interest, and are essential

parts of the body of scientific truth at the present time. The astronomy of the

ancient Greeks, expressed in the mathematical forms which they devised, has been

an important element in the formation of that astronomy of modern times of which

I have several of the eminent masters near me. And this connected progress

of knowledge from ancient to modern times has been exemplified in various por-

tions of science, and still goes on appearing in new examples. You recollect,
perhaf>s, that a Roman philosopher, Seneca, rnade a remark which, though con-

jectural, is striking. In speaking of comets, he said: These objects now seem

to follow no law, as the planets do. They appear unforeseen and unexpected,

filling us with perplexity and alarm. Yet these bodies, too, he said, shall disclose

their laws to astronomers in future years. Their returns will be predicted, their

laws known, and our posterity will wonder that we did not discern what is so plain.
And this prophecy has been fulfilled. Comets have had their returns predicted, and
have fulfilled their predictions. And though this is not always the case, for comets

still shine forth unpredicted and unforeseen, yet still, even in such cases, we are not

--2 REPORT 1858.

quite destitute of knowledge of their laws and progress ; for when an unexpected

stranger of this class blazes forth in our sky (as is the case at this moment), as soon

as he has shown himself for a few days, we can mark the path which he will follow,

the rate at which he will travel, and in a great degree the appearances which he will

assume. And even objects which as yet are still more lawless and perplexing to our

science than comets are, are still not altogether extraneous to the domain of our know-

ledge. There is a class of such objects which has been especially attended to by the

British Association. This is the subject of the first of the communications which are

to be laid before this Section to-day I speak of Prof. Powell's ' Report on Luminous

Meteors.' These objects, falling stars, shooting stars, fiery globes, or whatever they

may be commonly called, have attracted the attention of this Association for many

years ; and the Report which we are to have laid before us to-day is the continuation
of several Reports of the same kind prepared by the same gentleman in preceding

years. These bodies, as I have said, are in a great degree irreducible to laws and

Weextraneous to our science yet not wholly so.; have speculations of recent times

by some of our most eminent philosophers, in which these bodies play an important

part. Prof. W. Thomson has been led, by his mathematical speculations on Heat,

to the conclusion, that the heat of the sun is maintained by the perpetual falling in

upon his surface of the abnormal bodies moving in the solar system, which appear

to us as luminous meteors and shooting-stars. And he conceives that he has shown

that there is in those bodies a sufficient supply to keep up the heat of the sun ; and

that, by the effects of them, the sun may have gone on radiating heat for thousands

and thousands of years without the smallest diminution. And this, again, is the

--result of profound and complex mathematical calculations, so wide is the domain of

mathematical reasoning, and so necessary is it in any line of speculation in which

we are to convert our ignorance into knowledge. I may mention, as another example

of this, a case which is far removed from the vastness of astronomical phenomena,--

a case of the manifestation of mathematical law upon a scale of the smallest dimen-

sions, and in the work of a humble insect. I speak of the form of the cells of bees:

a mathematical problem which already attracted the attention of the ancient Greeks,

--and which has been the subject of mathematical investigation by several of the most

eminent mathematicians of modern times ; the most eminent, for being a problem

involving the properties of space of three dimensions, it requires considerable powers

of niathemaiical conception. Upon this subject two communications are promised

to the present Meeting, to be laid either before this Section or the Section of Natural

History. And in order further to exemplify the advantages derived from the action

of the British Association, I may mention another report upon a very different sub-

ject, Mr. Cayley's ' Report on the Progress of Theoretical Dynamics.' The gene-

rality, multiplicity, and complexity of the recent labours of analysts in this depart-

ment of mathematics have been so great, that ordinary mathematicians cannot hope
to follow them by reading the original memoirs ; and I am greatly obliged, as one of

them, to Mr. Cayley for enabling us compendiously and easily to understand what

has been done and how it has been done. Perhaps, after all, his Report is not so

very unlike that of Prof. Powell ' On Luminous Meteors ;' for the original researches

of the great analysts who have treated this subject, though bright and objects of won-

der, are so far above our head and so difficult to understand, that they are not unlike

the things tabulated in the other Report. And now, having explained that we must

often be necessarily difficult to follow in this Section, I must ask the ladies and gen-

tlemen here present, as the Spectator asks his readers, to believe that, if at any time

we are very dull, we have a design in it.

On a General Method of deriving the Properties of umbilical surfaces of the

   second order, having three unequal axes, from the properties of the sphere.

  By the Rev. J. Booth, LL.D., F.R.S.

   The author called the attention of the Section to the researches of M. Chasles and

other French geometers, on the methods of deriving the properties of surfaces of re-
volution from those of the sphere by the method of " Reciprocal Polars," and called

attention to the fact, that they did not grapple with the more general problem when
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  3

the three axes are unequal. Dr. Booth mentioned as the results of the method he
developed, that every umbilical surface of the second order has four directrix planes

--parallel to the circular sections of the surface ; that these directrix planes when the

--surface is an ellipsoid pass two by two through the directrices of the principal sec-

tion, in which lie the greatest and mean axes ; that every such surface has four foci
situate two by two on the umbilical diameters ; that when the surface is an oblate
spheroid, the four directrix planes are reduced to two parallel to the equator ; and
he concluded by showing that every graphic property of the sphere may be repro-
duced in an analogous form in umbilical surfaces of the second order having three

unequal axes.

 On the Mutual Relations of Inverse Curves and Inverse Curved Surfaces.

                     By the Rev. J. Booth, LL.D., F.R.S.

   Inverse curves and inverse curved surfaces were defined as curves and surfaces, the
product of whose coincident radii vectores is constant ; he showed that the tangents

to the two curves are equally inclined to the common vectors ; that the sum of the
vectors drawn from the common pole to the two inverse points, each divided by its

corresponding cord of curvature drawn through the pole, is constant and equal to

unity ; that if «=-, r being the radius vector of the primitive curve, the arc of the

derived curve is the same function of u that the arc of the original curve is of r. He

showed, also, that the element of the arc of the inverse curve represents the velocity
of a planet in its orbit through the corresponding element of its orbit, assumed as

the primary curve. He moreover proved that the circle is inverse to a circle, but
when the pole is on the circumference the inverse curve is a right line ; that when
the focus of a parabola is the pole, the inverse curve is a cardioid ; but that when the

vertex is the pole, the inverse curve is the cissoid ; that the spiral of Archimedes is

inverse to the hyperbolic spiral, while the logarithmic spiral is inverse to itself. He

drew attention also to certain curves which are inverse to themselves, pointed out the
facilities which this inverse method affords of passing from curves of the second order
to corresponding properties of curves of the higher orders, and concluded by stating
that the theory would be fully developed in the forthcoming Numbers of the
' Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics.'

                 On the Notion of Distance in Analytical Geometry.

                             By A. Cayley, F.R.S.

   The author remarks that the principles of modern geometry show that any metrical
proposition whatever is really based upon a purely descriptive proposition, and that

these principles contain in fact a theory of distance ; but that such theory has not
been disengaged from its applications and stated in a distinct and explicit form. The

paper contains an account of the theory in question, viz. it is shown that in any
system of geometry of two dimensions, the notion of distance can be arrived at from
descriptive principles by means of a conic termed the Absolute, and which in ordi-
nary plane geometry degenerates into a pair of points.

On Dr. Whewell's Views respecting the Nature and Value of Mathematical
          Definitions. By J. Pope Hennessy, of the Inner Temple.

    Having briefly referred to the several controversies which had taken place on this

--subject, the author remarked that the question at issue was equally interesting to two

great divisions of the scientific world the mathematical and the metaphysical.
That question is. Are the deductions of mathematical reasoning absolute truths, or
are they merely hypothetical ? Against the form of the reasoning there could be no
objection. It was that of the ordinary Sorites, and might, with a little labour, be
split up into separate syllogisms. This had, in fact, been done, with some of the
books of Euclid, by two foreign mathematicians. The reasoning process then being
perfectly sound, the absolute truth of the conclusion must depend on the absolute

                                                                                                         1*
     --

truth of the first premiss ; in other words, it must depend on the nature and value

of the definitions. If, as had often been asserted, a mathematical definition was

merely an arbitrary phrase employed to prevent useless repetition, it would be value-

less as far as the deduction of truth was concerned. An arbitrary definition never

could lead to absolute truth. But if the definitions were not merely an assumed

form of words, if, as Mr. Hennessy believed, they were necessarily involved in that

--fundamental conception under which the mind contemplates the foundations of geo-

metry,^the idea of space then the conclusions would be, in every sense of the word,

true. There were two ways in which the necessary truth of the definitions might be

shown The first, and by far the most important, was by a metaphysical analysis.

This had been done successfully by Dr. Whewell. The second, which had not

hitherto been attempted, was by a careful comparison of the definitions one with

another. This Mr. Hennessy then proceeded to do. Taking the earliest examples

with which we are acquainted, he showed that Euclid's definition of a right line and

his definition of a plane surface had the same differentia. Plato's definitions bore

a similar intimate relation to each other. Hero's definition of a plane surface, and

that adopted some centuries afterwards, of a right line, were also similar. He

pointed out that such analogies may be traced throughout the whole group of defi-

nitions, in which not only Euclid's Geometry, but any mathematical work what-

ever, as the mathematical Euclid, for example, is built up. Where the analogy ap-

pears to fail, it will be found, on careful examination, that it only makes the case

still stronger. For instaiice, Euclid's definitions of a circle and of parallel lines ap-

pear not to have the slightest analogy. This is readily explained by the fact that the

latter definition, as every one admits, is defective. But when we substitute for the

defective definition one which is sound and useful, an analogy becomes evident.

Parallel lines may properly be defined to be two right lines, the perpendicular di-

stances between which are all equal. A. definition closely resembling this had been

used by Boscovich and Wolfius. From it every property of parallels may be easily

deduced. Euclid's definition of a circle is, a continued line having a certain point

Nowwithin it from which all right lines drawn to the continued line are equal.  all

the radii of the circle are perpendicular to the circumference ; and if we could sup-

pose one line, of two parallels, to become a point, the other would become a circle.

The close analogy between the definitions of these two important conceptions is

thus evident. He believed also that these definitions contained the germs of all the

properties subsequently developed. If a definition were not a necessary truth, but

were merely an arbitrary form of words employed to prevent repetition, such analo-

gies as these never would have existed. Their existence shows that mathematical

definitions are neither accidental nor mere matters of choice.

On some Properties of a Series of the Powers of the same Number.

of the powers of any number. For instance, in the following series of the powers
of 5, the number of digits in the several recurrent vertical series may be expressed

by the powers of 2 :

consecutive sums of the several series being 7, 16, 34, 70, l42, &c. In this way
tables of the powers of numbers may be constructed to any extent whatever with
very little labour. This discovery will enable certain calculations to be made with a

On the Conditions of Equilibrium in a Rotating Spheroid.
          By Dr. F. A. Siljestrom, of Stockholm.

   In the ' Mecanique Celeste ' it is demonstrated that, the earth being considered
as a fluid mass rotating with a given velocity, the mathematical conditions of equili-

brium may be satisfied not only by the spheroid of small excentricity, which is the
earth's actual form, but also by another quite flat ellipsoidal figure. The following
remarks may in some measure serve to elucidate this very curious result of the cal-
culus, and also show that there really is some difference (and that an important one)

between the two states of equihbrium corresponding to the said figures.
   Supposing the mass to be in equilibrium with an ellipsoidal figure, the equation

of condition (though deduced from much more general principles) implies nothing

more than the hydrostatical equilibrium in the centre of the figure between a polar

and an equatorial fluid column. If, now, the excentricity is thought variable (the
mass being constant), it can be shown that the value of the equatorial pressure (con-
sidered as a function of the excentricity) has a maxinmm, on both sides of which

there may be a value equal to that of the polar pressure ; consequently two states

of equilibrium and two different figures.
   Considering these two states of equilibrium, it is further shown that if in each case

the excentricity is thought a little increased or diminished, the corresponding varia-
tions of the polar and the equatorial pressure will follow in such a manner that

only with the figure of small excentricity (the earth's actual form) there will be

stahiliiy of equilibrium.

  Let EBF represent the actual figure of the earth, and sup-
pose the figure change as DAG. Then the equatorial pressure

>AC will be polar pressure DC, and consequently there will

be a tendency with the mass to resume the former figure. But

EBFif represents the other (elongated) figure of equilibrium,

and the excentricity is likewise thought a little increased, then
<ACthe pressure of
will prove          pressure of DC, and con-

sequently the mass will have a tendency still more to change

in the same direction.

   As for Jacobi's famous ellipsoid of three different axes, it will in no way, if ex-
amined in this manner, afford stability of equilibrium. Consequently with a given
velocity of rotation there can be only one ellipsoidal figure with which a fluid mass
subject to its own attractive forces, may remain in a real state of equilibrium.

 On the Duration of Luminous Impressions on certain Points of the Betina.

              By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S. L.^ E.

   It is well known that the duration of luminous impressions on the retina is one-

third of a second for white light of ordinary intensity. In the Report of the Belfast

Meeting, I have shown that the small circular area at the end of the optical axis,

whether it be retina or choroid, retains light longer than the general retina, after the

eye has been exposed to light ; and I have recently observed that certain points of

that membrane, situated apparently near its termination at the ciliary processes, have

even a greater retentive power. In order to observe this curious phenomenon, we

must extinguish, suddenly, a gas-flame, to the light of which the eye has been for

Wesome time exposed.  shall then observe a number of bright luminous points

arranged in a circle, the diameter of which is about 72°. These bright points, or

stars, apparently placed at equal distances, vanish so quickly that I have found it

very difficult to determine their number. They may amount to fifteen or twenty. I

have sometimes observed them upon extinguishing a candle, and also upon quickly

shutting the eyes. The parts of the retina from which these points of light emanate

are probably places where the retina is attached to the ciliary ring, or other parts in

the interior of the eye, and may therefore be detected by the anatomist.

             On Vision through the Foramen Centrule of the Retina.

             By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.B.S. L 8f E.

   At the Meeting of the British Association which was held at Belfast 1 gave an
account of a case of vision, in which it was performed entirely by the choroid coat,
or rather through the foramen centrale of the retina. The space of distinct vision,
as ascertained by the number of minute printed letters which the patient could read,
was 4i°, the angle subtended by the foramen, which I had previously determined by
experiment. In this case the paralysis of the retina was permanent, and the patient
was blind, with the exception of the small amount of vision which he enjoyed through
the foramen. In the case to which I now call the attention of the Section, paralysis
was temporary, and was accompanied with severe headaches ; but as soon as the
patient recovered her health, the retina resumed its usual functions. In order to find
the area of distinct vision, the patient observed with care the number of small and
sharply printed letters which she could read at a certain distance from the eye ; and
upon measuring the breadth of these letters, and their distance from the eye, I found
that they subtended an angle of 4J°, corresponding with the size of the opening in
the retina. These facts, when viewed in connexion with those which I described at
the Swansea Meeting, may throw some light on the functions exercised by the retina
as a whole, or by some of its individual layers. I have placed it beyond a doubt, that
the membrane, whether choroid or retina, which occupies an area of 4^° at the ex-
tremity of the optical axis of the eye, is in certain cases less retentive of luminous
impression, and in others more retentive than the retina. If the microscope proves
that there is no retina corresponding to that area, we must consider the choroid coat
as the seat of vision. If it should prove that any one of the layers of the retina

occupies that area, while the rest are wanting, it will be manifest that that layer is

the seat of vision, or rather of luminous impressions.

On certain Abnormal Structures in the Crystalline Lenses of Animals, and
  in the Human Crystalline. By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S.
   L.8fE.

  In examining, many years ago, the structure of the crystalline lens in the Mam-

malia, Birds, Fishes, and Reptiles, the results of which are printed in the ' Philo-
sophical Transactions,' I observed several deviations from the normal structure of
jjarticular lenses, which I did not think important enough to publish. Having found,
however, that these abnormal structures have been in some instances taken for the
true structures, and that structures accurately determined have, on their authority,
been considered erroneous, it is necessary to draw the attention of anatomists to the

subject.

   In the lenses of several large whales brought home by the Arctic navigators, I

found that the fibres were related to four rectangular septa* ; but in one lens I found

                                  * Phil. Trans. 1836. plate 5. figs. 1, 2, No. 4.

only three septa on the anterior surface, and five on the posterior surface, as shown
Nowin fig 1, two of the three septa being doubled at their extremities.
                                                                         Leeuwen-

Fig. 1.-- Whale.

hoek * found in the lens of a whale five septa inclined 72° to each other, which

doubtless was an abnormal structure, such as that now described, arising either

from disease or old age.
    In the lens of the Cow, and generally speaking of most quadrupeds, there are three

septa inclined 120° to each other ; but in the lens of a cow eleven years old, I found
four septa on one side of the lens and seven on the other, very unsymmetrically dis-
posed. In the other lens of the same cow there were .six septa on each side, also

 unsymmetrically dieposed. In both these cases the additional septa are placed at
the extremities of the three normal septa. These structures are exhibited in figures
2 and 3.

of 120°; but in the posterior surface of the other there were six septa, placed so

unsymmetrically, as in fig. 4, that five of them

were in one semicircle, while only one was in the

other.

   When the lenses now described were immersed

in distilled water and examined by polarized light,

the optical figures which they exhibited were not

in the slightest degree disturbed by the want of

symmetry in the number and position of their

septa.

It will be seen from the figures, that in number-

ing the septa I have counted only those from

which the groups of fibres, or vortices as they have

been called by Leeuwenhoek, take their origin.

   If the abnormal structures now described are

the result of disease, or of that change in the

lens which is produced by age, it is very probable that several of the varieties of

s'.ructure observed in the human crystalline are abnormal. Reil * thought he saw
in a human foetus, seven months old, six septa radiating from each pole, while
in adults there were only /our. Dr. Thomas Young f has given a drawing of
the human crystalline (fig. 93) in which the fibres occupy ten groups or vortices,

separated by ten radial lines extending from the margin to the centre of the lens,

each fibre being parallel to their radii, and consequently meeting at an acute angle.
In another figure, 95, he represents what he calls ramifications from the margin of

the crystalline lens, that is, ramifications of fibres, a stiucture which is wlioilv in-

compatible with his fig. 93, showing the order of the fibres of the human crystalline.

No other observer has seen such an arrangement of fibres either in the human cit-

stalline or in any other lens. It is obvious, indeed, that Dr. Young did not possess'
correct method of tracing the fibres to their origin, because he makes their arrange-
ment in Fishes similar to their arrangement in Birds, that is, extending from pole to

pole like the meridians of a globe J, a structure contrary to the results obtained by

every observer.

    In his ' Icones Oculi Humani,' Soemmering § has given two very minute drawings

of the crystalline ; and has inferred merely from its mode of splitting after macera-

tion in alcohol, that it divides into four unequal segments, and that in each of these
four there are four fissures ; and though he afterwards found that by " a careful and
continued maceration " in alcohol it separated into fibres, yet he argues that this is
no proof that the recent or the living lens has a fibrous structure " like the zeolites ! "

Had he been acquainted with the existence of teeth in each fibre by which they are

held together to give solidity and permanence of form to a soft and semifluid body,

he could not have considered, as he does, the crystalline lens to be merely a lenti-

cular humour " like a drop of dissolved gum ||.''

    In consequence of these contradictory opinions respecting the structure of the

human crystalline, I was anxious to study it by means of the optical method which
had occurred to me of tracing the fibres to their origin by the diffracted images which

they produced.

   In some lenses, the age of which I did not know, I found three fepta, as in

quadrupeds.

   In two very large lenses there were on each side /our septa, two being placed at

each end of a central line, like that which forms the two septa in the Hare and Sal-
mon. This structure is shown in the Phil. Trans. 1836, plate 6. figs. 3, 4, but in
the human lens the central line was very much shorter than in these figures. The

structure, however, was so distinct, that I could measure the length of the central

line, which was 0-0533, or ^\ of an inch.
   In four lenses which I examined three days after death, I observed ten septa on

each side, but they had no resemblance whatever to the figure given by Dr. Young.

The groups of fibres or vortices were like those of quadrupeds, with this difference,
that the septa to which they were related were longer and much nearer the margin

of the lens. These lenses were taken from male and female subjects about forty

years of age.

More recent observers have found equal difficulties in determining the true struc-

ture of the human crystalline. Mr. Nunneley*, in his valuable paper on the crystal-

line lens, lately published in the Microscopic Journal, makes the following remarks:
   " In the human lens the arrangement of the fibres is the most complicated of any,

for while the type is the mammalian tripod, and is best seen in the fcEtus, in the adult

the planes are more numerous, in consequence of the primary planes immediately

branching into secondary, so that a very complicated curvature of fibres exists ; the

septa upon the two surfaces frequently not being equal, those of the posterior being

more numerous than those of the anterior. In the anterior nine, septa and radiations

are often found, in the posterior surface twelve, which Arnold regards as the more

common arrangement in man. This complicity, however, is only in the more super-

ficial layers, for towards the axis the normal mammalian triseptal division is pre-

served f."
   Mr. Nunneley does not inform us whether the statement that the structure varies

in the same lens is founded on his own observations or on those of Arnold. Mr.

Nunneley's mode of observing consists in "immersing the lens for a few minutes in
water at 180° Fahr.," and after allowing it to dry in a warm room, he observes the

number of sections into which it splits, and upon the supposition that it splits only

in the direction of the septa, he infers the number of the septa from the number of

Wethese directions.      cannot place much confidence in results thus obtained. The

lens, we think, should be studied in its entire state by following to their origin the

converging or parallel fibres, by observing the changes in the diffracted spectra which

they produce. By removing in succession the external layers, it will be easy to

determine whether or not the structure changes in the layers near the axis.

               By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S. L. ^ E.

The crystalline lens of the Cuttle-fish differs in a remarkable degree from that of

all other animals. Cuvier does not seem to have examined its structure. In his

Memoir on the MoUusca, he merely gives a drawing of its external form, and

--mentions that it consists of two parts easily separated, the anterior part being

more convex than the posterior. In the new edition of his ' Lectures on Compara-

MM.tive Anatomy,' published in 1845, the editors,           Frederick Cuvier and Laurillard,

have repeated almost verbatim the description of the lens given in the original

memoir %.
   Valentin, in Wagner's ' Icones Zootomicae § ', has given a section of the crystalline

lens of the Cephalopods, which is repeated in Victor Carus's ' Icones Zootomicae ||.'

In this drawing the lens is represented as a sphere, the anterior part being much

larger than the posterior. In his ' Lectures on Comparative Anatomy and Physiology

of the Invertebrate Animals^,' Professor Owen describes the lens as Cuvier does, as

consisting of two distinct parts, the anterior or smaller moiety being the segment of

   * In his more recent work, ' On the Organs of Vision, their Anatomy and Physiology,'
plate 5, figs. 7 and 8, Mr. Nunneley has represented the human crystalline as having nine
septa in its anterior, and twelve in its posterior surface.

a larger sphere, and the posterior that of a smaller sphere* ; and he adds, what is not

correct, that " the lens presents the same denticulated fibrous structure, arranged in

concentric lamina;, as in the higher animals." Sieboldf gives nearly the same

account of the crystalline, the lens being spherical, and the anterior of its two halves
less convex than the posterior. Mr. Wharton Jones considers the lens as " a sphere

divided into two unequal segments, an anterior smaller and a posterior larger J."
    In studying the crj'stalline lenses of animals about twenty-five years ago, I had

occasion to examine several lenses of the Cuttle-fish, but having found a consider-

able difference in the structure of different lenses, and not knowing the species from

which they were taken, I did not publish my observations in the memoirs which I

sent to the Royal Society in 1833 and 1835. As the subject, however, is a very

interesting one, and as the attention of anatomists has been lately directed to the

structure of the cr^^stalline lens, I have ventured to submit to the Section a short

account of my observations.

In the greater number of lenses which I have examined, and which I believe were

those of the Sepia Loligo, the lens was not a sphere, as maintained by the greater

number of the anatomists to whom I have referred, nor did it consist of two spherical

segments of unequal convexity. Its posterior and larger portion was decidedly a

paraboloid, and its anterior and smaller portion a spherical meniscus, whose concave

surface coincides with the convex surface of the section of the paraboloid. This re-

ABCmarkable form of the lens is represented in fig. 1, where  is the axis of the lens,

ADCE DBEa section of the whole lens through the axis,         the convex surface of

MNOPthe paraboloid, which is spherical, and          (fig. 2) the spherical meniscus, whose

whether this structure is abnormal, or that of lenses belonging to different species of

the Cuttle-fish. That it was not produced by induration, will appear from the

following description of indurated lenses which have been in my possession for

twenty-five years, in all of which the facesDBEare convex,and thefacesMON concave.

The paraboloidal part of the lens, viz. ADBE, consists of paraboloidal laminae, the

surfaces of which are perfectly smooth, and give no diffracted images by reflexion like
MNOP,the surfaces of the laminae of other lenses. The spherical portion,
                                                                           consists

of spherical laminee of the same character. The structure of both portions of the

lens is fibrous, the fibres diverging from poles in the axis of the lenses, that is from

one pole in each lamina of the two lenses. The fibres, however, must be perfectly

flat in order to compose laminae perfectly smooth ; and I have not been able to
observe that they are united by teeth as they are in other animals. They must

adhere, therefore, to each other by the contact of their surfaces merely, or by some

structure not visible in the microscope, and not showing itself by its action upon light.

The thin transparent membranes which cover the anterior convex surface of the

paraboloid, and the concave surface of the spherical meniscus, have also a fibrous

structure, the fibres diverging from a single pole in the axis of the lenses. The sur-

faces which these membranes cover are the ends of all the fibres which constitute

the lens ; and each lamina terminates in a sort of ring or margin which is well

defined. This ring is a little larger in diameter than the proper section of the para-

boloid, and the consequence of this is that the fibres, or the termination of the laminae,

are curved upwards, so that their surfaces are concave near the line DBE.
MONThe two lenses are curiously united. The concave surface
                                                                    is less than the

Mconvex one, DBE, and there is a notch between D and going round the lens. The

meniscus is kept in its proper place, in contact with the paraboloid, by a ring abed

(fig. 3), in which a6=0-50 of an inch, and cd=0-31.
   In the Sepia Elcdona the whole lens is nearly spherical, as shown in fig. 4, the

smaller. The lens divides into two parts along mabcn, abc being a hemisphere about

the ^^th of an inch in diameter. The whole annular suiface, from the circumference

7iin to a, c, is covered with two membranes, to which the ciliary processes are attached.

In order to examine the polarizing structure of the lens, I made a section of it by

two planes parallel to the axis, so that the plate was about the 15th part of an inch

Whenthick.  immersed in oil, it gave, in polarized light, the figure shown in fig. 5,

when the axis of the lens /)o was parallel or perpendicular to the plane of polariza-
tion. The tints to the left o( v and w were the highest, namely the yellow of the

first order. The sections 1, 2, 3, 4 are negative in reference to r, and 5, 6, 7, 8 are

also negative in reference to the intersection between 6 and 7. When the polarized

light is transmitted along the axis of the eye, a black cross is seen, as in uniaxal

negative crystals ; but the cross opens upon turning round the section, indicating a

defect of symmetry in the substance of the lens round the axis. The luminous por-

tions at 5, 6 are very bright.

   When the lenses are quickly dried, the laminae separate from each other, and the

lenses have the appearance of pearls ; the resemblance is so great, that when the ex-
periment is well made, it is difficult to distinguish them from real pearls, as will be

seen in the accompanying specimens*.

                  * These specimens were exhibited to the Section.

   In many of these lenses the laminae are separated in some parts and not in others,
and the consequence of this is, that when we look at the convex surface of the para-
boloid by reflected light, we observe a number of luminous and dark rings surround-

ing the axis of the lens, the luminous rings being produced by the total reflexion of
the light from one or more of the separated surfaces. The effect thus produced is
very beautiful, as will be seen in the specimens on the table.

   The preceding observations were made, as I have already stated, nearly twenty-

five years ago, and I have copied them as they stand in the Journal of my Experi-

ments. I observe, however, some discrepancies between the figures and their de-
scriptions, arising, I think, chiefly from not being able to distinguish the lenses of
one species from those of another. These discrepancies I hope to be able to recon-
cile before this communication is published.

0}i the Use of Amethyst Plates in Experiments on the Polarization of Light.

              By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S. L. ^- E.

    In order to determine the exact position of the plane of primitive polarization, it

was usual to observe when the intensity of the extraordinary image of the analysing
prism was a minimum ; but as it is difficult to obtain light perfectly homogeneous,

the light of this image could not be completely extinguished. In his experiments on

the rotatory phenomena of quartz, M. Biot employed a coloured glass, which trans-
mitted only the extreme red rays of the spectrum ; but this method, owing to^the
great loss of light in the polarized pencil, was attended with so many inconveniences,

that fifteen or twenty trials were required before he could determine the zero of his

instrument. In order to remedy this evil, M. Soleil interposed between the polar-
izing apparatus and the analysing prism two plates of quartz of equal thickness, the

one right-handed and the other left-handed. These plates were united so as to give
the same tint when the plane of the principal section of the analysing prism coin-
cided with the plane of primitive polarization. This ingenious apparatus was sub-
mitted to the Academy of Sciences on the 23rd of June, 1845, and has been used

since that time by M. Senarmont and others in their experiments on polarization.
In the year 1819 I communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh the very same
method of placing the principal section of the analysing prism in the plane of pri-
mitive polarization ; but in place of using two plates of right and left-handed quartz,

I used a single plate of amethyst, in which the two kinds of quartz were combined,
during the formation of the crystal. This piece of apparatus, which is obviously

superior to that of M. Soleil, is thus described in the paper to which I have referred :
"The properties of amethyst, which have now been described, render a plate of this
mineral a valuable addition to our apparatus for conducting experiments on the
polarization of light. If we wish to place the principal section of the analysing
prism exactly in the plane of primitive polarization, we have only to interpose a thin
plate of amethyst like that shown in the figure, and if the tints of both sets of veins

are exactly similar, the analysing prism will have the required position. If the one
set of tints is bluer or whiter than the other, or if there is the slightest difference
between them, the position of the prism must be altered till that difference is no

longer perceptible. If we wish to place a plate of sulphate of lime or any other

interposition of the amethyst plate will give us the same assistance, by indicating

that the circular (rotatory) tints are not affected by it; whereas if we wish to place

the axis of the sulphate of lime at an angle of 45° to the primitive plane of polariza-

tion, the amethyst will point out this position when the opposite circular tints suffer

an equal change."

                On Professor Petzval's New Combination Lens.

   Sir David Brewster laid before the meeting a paper, translated by Mr. Paul

Pretsch, entitled " Prof. Petzval's New Combination Lens, as an Object-glass for

Telescopes," and exhibited a fine telescope for which the lens had been originally
constructed. This telescope was constructed for the Imperial General Survey Office
at Vienna, for the purpose of making maps, and the lens which it contained has been

found to be the very best that has yet been constructed for the purposes of photo-

graphy.
   Sir David Brewster gave a brief analysis of this long and interesting communica-

tion, of which the following is the conclusion :-- " What I have offered is a kind of

universal instrument, consisting of three achromaticlenses. The front lens, in con-
nexion with a little larger posterior lens, and mounted like an ordinary portrait lens,
reproduces a strongly illuminated and well-defined picture of the usual size. The
same front lens, in connexion with a smaller posterior lens, reproduces a large picture
with perfect perspective, equal distribution of light, and equal sharpness of the pic-
ture. It forms a combination for multifarious applications, for taking views, groups

of persons, maps," &c.

   The author, after quoting some passages in Sir David Brewster's ' Natural Magic,'
in which the author had intimated that reflexion by concave specula must form the

basis of all spectral illusions by reflexion, and pointing out the inconvenience of
using these for producing images of living and moving persons, in consequence of
their inverting objects, slated that he had contrived a means by which living actors,
some the real persons, others the images of persons concealed from the direct view
of the spectators, might be formed by a large plate of glass dividing the room in
which the exhibition was made, the spectators being iu a darkened portion above,
but at one side of the glass plate ; while the living persons on the other side of it
 could be seen quite clearly through the glass, and the images of other persons, walk-
ing about in the room under them, seen by reflexion, would appear in the same place
 as the living persons seen directly, such arrangement becoming, in fact, a transparent

mirror, and the actors could be thus made to appear to perform most amusing spec-
 tral feats, such as passing through walls, into and coming out of the living actors,

and soon.

        Oh a New Case of Binocular Vision. By the Rev. J. Dingle.

    The author remarked, that without some provision imperfect vision would conti-
 nually arise from the difference of the pictures in the two eyes. Even in the same
 object, the point looked at is often visible only to one eye, and the picture of it is
 combined in the sensorium with the picture of another part ; and in other cases the
 superposition of different images would sometimes lead to great inconvenience and
 confusion. It sometimes happens, for instance, that in looking at a field of view at
 some distance, objects considerably nearer are so interposed as to present themselves
 in the picture formed in one eye and not in the other. Thus, in looking at a landscape,
 if the finger or any other object is held before one eye, the image of it from the one
 retina is superposed in the sensorium on a part of the landscape formed in the other

 eye. On mere physical principles, this might be expected to blot out or greatly con-

 fuse that part of the landscape upon which it was placed ; but upon trial this is not
 found to be the case, as that part is merely a little dimmer than the rest from being
 seen onlv with one eye, but is equally distinct and as truly coloured. By various
 experiments the author had ascertained that this was the result of a peculiar power
 of the will, by means of which the mind is enabled, when two different images are

 --superposed in the sensorium, to select whichever it pleases, to bring that object into

  view, and entirely to obliterate the other, it sees, in fact, whichever it wills to see,
 and the other image, simply by being neglected, becomes invisible. In ordinary
 vision, the determination of the image to be seen is effected by the same act of the
  will which determines the position of the optic axes; but by certain arrangements

 which were indicated, both images may be made to have the same relation to the

  optic axes ; and as the predisposition to select one or the olher is thus obviated, it is
 made indifierent to the mind which of the two images that occupy the same place in

 the sensorium it shall see*. When these arrangements are made, it is found that

     * The proof of the law might be allowed to rest on an accurate observation of what is
  ahii03t constantly taking place in the act of vision ; but the following simple experiment may

mere efforts of the will can easily bring either the one or the other into view. The
importance of this law, which enables the mind to select its image, was pointed out

in different cases of ordinary vision. It obviates the difficulty already adverted to,

of having two different pictures on the same spot ; it has not improbably an import-
ant influence in producing the general stereoscopic effect ; it also, to some extent,
remedies the effect of squinting, by obliterating the picture ia the imperfect eye,
which could not be else done without shutting it. The effect of the law, in some
extraordinary cases, was also noticed, especially in the power of the will to fix images
on the sight, as Sir Isaac Newton instances in his own case (see his ' Life,' by Sir
David Brewster). The author pointed out the great interest of the subject, not only
in its practical aspect, but also as having an important bearing on the connexion be-
tween mind and matter.

               On some Optical Properties of Phosphorus.

            By Dr. Gladstone aiid the Rev. T. P. Dale.

The authors had recently examined the effect of temperature on refraction by

means of the instrument constructed by the Rev. Baden Powell, from a grant of the
British Association. They had extended their examination of the optical properties

of phosphorus to other points.    Solid phosphorus at 25® C. gave the following

--refractive indices :                                                  2-1059

   This shows an amount of refraction only just exceeded by diamond or chromate of
lead, and an amount of dispersion perhaps unapproached by that of any other sub-

stance.

Melted phosphorus at 35° C. gave the indices                                               2-0389

This shows a considerable diminution both of the refractive and dispersive power.
At the temperature of 35" C, the refraction of the orange ray through solid phos-
phorus was to that through the liquid body in the ratio of 2-117 to 2-071.

   The change of refrangibility caused by change of temperature is greater with liquid

phosphorus than with any other known body. A saturated solution of phosphorus

in bisulphide of carbon is almost as refractive and dispersive as the element itself.

Refractive indices for the principal fixed lines of the spectrum, as seen through such

a solution, were given. There is a certain indistinctness about the prismatic image

seen through phos;jhorus not depending on opacity or crystalline structure, and not

arising from the high refraction or dispersion, nor wholly from the great sensitive-

ness to changes of temperature. It may be connected with the well-known allotropic

variations of this body, no particular specimen being really homogeneous. The

A Hand Heliostat, for the purpose of flashing Sun Signals, from on board

   Ship or on Land, in Sunny Climates. By F. Galton, Sec. R.G.S.

  A flash of sunlight from a looking-glass, of a few inches in the side, can be seen

assist in making it apparent. Let a person stand before a papered wall with pictures hanging
oil it, and sliift tlie optic axes so as to bring diiferent patterns of the paper together. The
images of the pictures formed in the two eyes will then be separated in the sensoiium, and
shifted off upon the image of a part of the paper; and if the attention is turned upon these
parts, it will be found that it may be made to depend on an effort of tlie will whether the i<ic-
ture or the paper will be seen there. The experiment might be still better made with a suit-
able piece of a different paper pinned on the wall; as in the case of pictures, the more inter-
esting or much brighter objects are apt to force themselves too much on the attention.

further than any terrestrial object whatever ; and the instrument about to be described

shows how this remarkable power may be utilized for the purposes of telegraphy.

Heliostats are used in all Government surveys, and their power is well known in

penetrating haze, and their utility in requiring no "skyline." They were also

habitually employed by the Russians for telegraphy during the Crimean war. But

all heliostats that have been hitherto used have been fixtures of large dimensions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

commonly, a shaded screen, with an aperture in it, was placed at many yards from

the signaller, who stationed himself in such a way that when he could see the play

of his flash about the hole in the screen, he might be sure that some of the rays

which passed through the aperture would be visible at the distant station. At other

times, a polished ring was used for the same purpose as the screen, but the principle

was the same. The present instrument dispenses with all fixture ; it is more port-
able than a ship's telescope and as manageable as a ship's quadrant, and may be

made by a carpenter for 4s., if he possesses a convex spectacle-lens of short focus

and a piece of good looking-glass. The looking-glass attached to the heliostat is

about 3 inches by 4^ inches, and therefore capable of being seen at distances, which

may be calculated from the fact, that a mirror 1 inch square is perfectly visible, in

average sunny weather, at the distance of 8 miles, and that it shows as a brilliant

and glistening star at 2 miles. Before describing its principle and action, it will be

necessary to explain clearly the peculiar characteristic of the reflexion of the sun's

rays from a mirror. If, for instance, we take a small square looking-glass and throw

its flash upon a wall 2 or 3 feet off, the shape of the flash will be little different from

that of the mirror itself, seen in perspective ; but if we direct it on an object 3

or 4 yards ofi^, the angles of the flash will appear decidedly n.unded ; at 20 or 30

paces it will appear fairly circular; and if we can manage to see it at 50 or 100

yards (which can only be effected by selecting some object to throw it on, that is

naturally of a light colour, but lying under a dark shade), it will appear like a mock

sun, of identically the same shape and size as the sun itself; and for all greater di-

stances the appearance remains the same. That is to say, whatever may be the shape

or size of the mirror, and whatever the irregularity of the distant objects on which

the flash happens to be thrown, the shape and size of that flash, if it could be seen

by the signaller, would always appear to him as exactly that of the sun. In fact,

the flash forms a cone of light, at the blunted apex of which are the mirror and the

signaller's eye, and whose vertical angle equals that of the sun's angular diameter.

Whoever is covered by the flash sees the mirror, like a small fragment of the sun

itself, held in the hand of the observer ; and the larger the mirror, compared to the
distance, the larger and the more dazzling does it appear. Now, the hand heliostat

provides a bright appearance of the sun, which, when the instrument is adjusted and

looked through, overlays the exact area which is covered by the flash of the mirror,

which is attached to its side. It is a perfect substitute for that mock sun which we
can see at 50 or 100 paces distant, but which becomes too faint to be traced much
further. All we have to do, when we wish to send a flash to a distant object, is to

make that image of the sun overlay the object, just as may be done in rough sextant

Aobservations. The principle of the instrument is extremely simple.  convex lens,

of any focal distance (5 inches is convenient), has a small screen attached to it,

whose surface is at its focal distance. The mirror is so placed that a small portion

of its flash impinges upon one end of the lens; say, the right-hand side of it. The

signaller's eye looks partly through the other end of the lens, and partly free of it.

Now the rays from any one point of the sun's surface are converged by the right

side of the lens to a bright speck on the screen ; and those rays which radiate from

that speck and impinge on the left side of the lens are brought back by means of it

to a state of parallelism with the rays that originally left the mirror. Consequently

the signaller's eye sees the bright speck in the precise direction of the vanishing

point of the mirror's flash, and he can, by looking partly to the side of the lens,

refer it to some particular spot in the distant landscape. But what is true for any
one point on the sun's disc is true for every point, and accordingly we obtain a

bright disc upon the screen, which appears of exactly the same shape and size as

the sun itself, and necessarily overlays the exact area covered by the flash of the

mirror. It is scarcely possible to describe the instruments that were submitted to

the Association without drawings. They consisted of a tube of wood 15 inches long.

and with an eye-hole at one end ; a mirror turned on an axis at right angles to the
tube ; and, in front of the mirror, a slip was cut away from the side of the tube, and
the lens was inserted athwart the cut-out part. Part of the lens projected within the
tube, and part outside of it and in front of the mirror. The screen was placed at
the further end of the cut-out part, and an envelope protected the whole from injury.

A slide in front of the lens regulated the amount of light thrown on it, and toned

the image to the required degree of brightness. The addition of a telescope was not
found practically of much use ; neither was that of a second mirror, for double
reflexion, to meet the difficulty of sending signals when the sun was behind the
back of the signaller. It is not difficult to signal within 12° of the point opposite
to the sun, and it is possible to do so within 7°. The looking-glass should be of
the very best plate-glass, and it ought to have its sides truly parallel, else there will
be a confusion of images and an irregularity in the flash. Letters are conveyed by
treble groups of flashes, each of which groups consists of one, two, or three flashes,
as the case may be.

   The author detailed the experiments he had made with the help of an assistant,
and trusted that a full trial of the instrument at sea would be made by the authorities
of the Navy, with a view of determining whether it should not be accepted by them
as a subsidiary signalling instrument throughout Her Majesty's Service. One of the

land heliostats has been sent to the United Service Institution, in Whitehall Place,
together with a more detailed explanation.

       On the Fixed Lines of the Solar Spectrum.
         By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

   The author exhibited maps of the fixed lines and bands seen in the solar spectrum

Abetween those usually designated and B, and of those which he succeeded in seeing

beyond K. The light examined was that of the full sun at noon about midsummer-

day. The dark lines and bands in the lavender rays coincided with those drawn bv

Prof. Stokes, as occurring in fluorescent phenomena; and with those of M.Becquerel,

which occur in the photographic image ; but the author's map contained many finer
ones. It extended to M. Becquerel's N. Another map was exhibited of the dark

lines and bands that make their appearance in the orange and yellow rays when the

sun is near the horizon, as previously described by Sir David Brewster. The long

space of air traversed by the sun's rays when setting also absorbs the more refrangible

rays, but makes no difference in the angular position of the fixed lines themselves.

The light of the moon exhibits the same black lines, and, when close to the horizon,

it shows the additional lines in the orange in the same angular position. The light

of the moon, answering in position to the violet rays of the sun, appears lavender,

and even grey, like the most refracted rays of the sun. As to the origin of these

lines. Dr. Gladstone had endeavoured to determine whether they were due to the

absorbent power of the earth's atmosphere, as the lines in the orange appear to be.

Fraunhofer's conclusion, that they do not occur in the light of some of the fixed

stars, was thought to be open to objection ; but the author's observations on the light

of the stars had not led him as yet either to a positive or negative result. Artificial

lights seen at a very great distance might determine the point. If these fixed lines

are dependent on the sun's atmosphere, they ought to be darkest in the light coming

from the edge of the sun's disc                                                                                                                                              but the author had been unable to find any differ-

       On the Influence of Light on Polarized Electrodes.

             By W. R. Grove, 3LA., F.R.S. S^c.

   The author, soon after the publication of Daguerre's experiments, had shown that
when light is allowed to impinge on a prepared daguerreotype plate in water, a vol-

taic current is evolved which affects the galvanometer. In the present experiments,

two platinized platinum plates are placed in dilute acid, and the one exposed to sun-

Alight while the other is in the dark.                                                                                                                                       current is detected by a galvanometer con-

nected with the plates, which, after many experiments, the author found was depend-

ent upon the original polarizatiou or unequal chemical action on the electrolyte,

the current being (with certain exceptions noticed in the paper) in the same direction
as that indicated by the original deflection of the galvanometer when it is first con-
nected with the plates. Experiments are given with other solutions producing the
same results. To prove that it is not an effect of heat, it is shown that non-lumi-
nous heat alone does not produce the effects, and that when the sunlight is made to
pass through coloured glasses before impinging on the plate, blue light produces a
greater deflection than yellow or red, showing that the results are due to the che-
mical, and not to the calorific rays of the sun. The effects appear therefore to be
due to an augmentation by the impact of light of the electro-chemical action taking
place at the surface of the plates, the chemical action being doubtless due, as in the
known cases of polarized electrodes, to heterogeneous films on the surface.

  On a New, Cheap, and Permanent Process in Photography.
Bt/W. M'Craw. (Communicated by Sir David Brewster.)

I now set myself to repeat in writing the mode I use for producing the specimens

which attracted your notice to-day, of permanent photographic prints, produced

without either silver, gold, or the noxious hyposulphite of soda. I need not expatiate

to you upon the advantages of such a process. It is, indeed, felt to be the great

--photographic desideratum wherever photography is practised and that is nearly all
--over the world particularly by the conscientious photographer and the considerate

collector of photographs. The labours of the Committee appointed by the Photo-

graphic Society of London, to inquire into the cause of the fading of photographs

--after a lapse of two years, have only amounted to this, that photographs of a cer-

--tain kind have all faded ; and that some of those of the kind that have stood best

have unaccountably faded, the sad presumption being, that in time all photographs

produced in the usual way, by the means of chloride of silver, and fixed (as it is

called) by hyposulphite of soda, will perish. These considerations, and the fact of

a prize being offered by a French nobleman for the discovery of a process for print-

ing photographs in carbon, set me to experiment in that direction. But my experi-

ments with carbon and various pigments led me to think that no material applied

mechanically, or that could not be made to take the shape of a dye or chemical solu-

tion, would ever give results with the exquisite half-tints of the present beautiful but

perishable process. The photographic properties of bichromate of potass were pointed

out by Mr. Mungo Ponton twenty years ago, giving photographs of a pale tawny

Acolour.  piece of paper is washed over with the saturated solution of the bichro-

mate, and when dried in the dark is of a bright yellow colour, and very sensitive to

light. If a negative photograph, or a piece of lace or a leaf, be placed over the pre-

pared paper, and put in sunshine, in a few minutes a perfect impression of the object

is obtained. The fight darkens the colour of the bichromate, and renders it inso-
luble in water, while the yellow colour may be washed out from the parts protected
from the light by the lace or leaf, or negative photograph, as the case may be. But

pictures of this kind have little or no practical value ; for although the lights are good

enough, the deep black shadows are only represented by a tawny shade. Some

eighteen months ago a process was patented for deepening these photographs by

treating them with gallic acid and a salt of iron, which went by the name of ' Sella's

process.' I tried this process at the time according to the specification of the patent,

but failed to make one satisfactory specimen. They wanted everything that a good

--photograph should have, pure lights, clear half-tints, and deep shadows ; and as I

found that others had not been more successful, I abandoned my experiments. But

in the course of further experiments, a year afterwards, with carbon, I was struck with

the fact, that when a drop of a solution of bichromate of potass was allowed to fall on

a piece of white paper and afterwards dried and exposed to the sun, when washed with

a solution of protosulphate of iron, and then with gallic acid, while the spot became

perfectly black, the surrounding white paper was unaffected by the Uquids. Know-

ing the photographic properties of the bichromate already described, I believed that

this might be the foundation of a good photographic process ; and that if the bichro-

mate could be kept from penetrating the pores of the paper, by being kept on its

surface, the defects of Sella's process might be avoided. With this view, I began,

by filling the pores of the paper with albumen, and then to render it insoluble, im-

 mersing the paper in ether. This, however, did not answer. But as it would be
 tedious to detail all the pains I took to discover what would not do, and to find in

 what proportions and in what order the right materials could be best applied, 1 will
 briefly give the formula which I have adopted, and by which the specimens alluded

--to were produced : First, take the white of eggs, and add 25 per cent, of a saturated

solution of common salt (to be well beat up and allowed to subside) ; float the paper
on the albumen for thirty seconds, and hang up to dry. Secondly, make a saturated

solution of bichromate of potass, to which has been added 25 per cent, of lieaufoy's
acetic acid ; float the paper on this solution for an instant, and when dry it is fit
for use : this must be done in the dark room. Thirdly, expose under a negative,
in a pressure frame, in the ordinary manner, until the picture is sufficiently printed

--in all its details, but not over-printed, as is usual with the old process. This re-

quires not more than half the ordinary time. Fourthly, immerse the pictures in a
vessel of water in the darkened room ; the undecomposed bichromate and albumen
then readily leave the lights and half-tints of the picture. Change the water fre-
quently, until it comes from the prints pure and clear. Fifthly, immerse the picture

now in a saturated solution of protosulphate of iron in cold water for five minutes,

and again rinse well in water. Sixthly, immerse the pictures again in a saturated
solution of gallic acid in cold water, and the colour will immediately begin to change
to a fine purple-black. Allow the pictures to remain in this until the deep shadows

--show no appearance of the yellow bichromate ; repeat the rinsing. Seventhly, im-

merse, finally, in the following mixture : Pyrogallic acid, two grains ; water, one
ounce ; Beaufoy's acetic acid, one ounce ; saturated solution of acetate of lead, two

drachms. This mixture brightens up the pictures marvellously, restoring the lights

that may have been partially lost in the previous parts of the process, deepening the

shadows, and bringing out the details ; rinse, finally, in water, and the pictures are

complete when dried and mounted. The advantages of this process may be briefly

-- --stated as follows : First, as to its economy ; Bichromate of potass, at 2d. per ounce,

is substituted for nitrate of silver at 5s. per ounce. Secondly, photographs in this

way can be produced with greater rapidity than by the old mode. Thirdly, the pic-

tures being composed of the same materials which form the constituent parts of

writing-ink, it may be fairly inferred that they will last as long as the paper upon

which they are printed. A beautiful photograph of Sir Walter Scott's monument,

obtained by this process, was exhibited to the Section.

   The author gave several instances of his men who had slept on deck exposed to
the moonbeams being so blind on landing that they had to be led by the hand. Also
the sailors were in the habit of waking up the soldiers who attempted to sleep on

deck, and warning them that they would be blinded.

   It consists of two semilenses on a frame, from the middle point between which
there extends a brass rod upon which the stereoscopic picture slides, so as to have
two adjustments; one along the rod for persons of different ages; and one of a rota-

tory kind, to place the horizontal lines in the picture parallel to the line joining the

two eyes, an adjustment which exists in no other form of the stereoscope. This in-

accurate results when applied to the measurement of small distances, that it appears
singular, as well as a matter of regret, it should so long have awaited a fair trial, and

the publicity it so well deserves.

   Although copiously described by Dr. Pearson in his valuable work on ' Practical
Astronomy,' so many varieties of double-image and other micrometers are there
treated, that the one under consideration has failed to attract more than a passing
notice from the Doctor's readers, and unfortunately no published results have made
their appearance from which amateurs might judge of the accuracy attainable by its

use. Had such been forthcoming, doubtless the Ocular Crystal Micrometer would

have been generally adopted, and the well-grounded complaint, of the inferiority
of the measures of distance of double stars to those of the angles of position, would
never have been heard of.

    Perhaps the best method of drawing attention to this micrometer will be briefly
to explain the construction and use of one, originally made for Admiral Smyth,
transferred by him to the Hartwell Observatory in 1829, on becoming possessed of
the larger one described in his ' Celestial Cycle,' and recently placed in the hands
of Mr. Pogson for trial, by the kindness of its present owner. Dr. Lee.

   The Ocular Crystal Micrometer consists of a variable eyepiece, i. e. one in which
the second or field-lens is moveable by a rack-work, so as to vary the distance
between it and the eye-lens. This distance is read off, by the help of a vernier, on a
scale of equal parts, and this, as will be shown, is an important element in the ob-

Oservation. By a well-known optical formula, if e,/, and represent respectively

the focal lengths of the eye-lens, field-lens, and object-glass of a telescope, when

used with a certain eyepiece, also d, the distance between the first-named lenses, the
magnifying power of the telescope with such eyepiece will be thus found :

                                       Power= f.(.e+f- d).

From this it is manifest, that when the two lenses are in contact, the power will be
a maximum ; that as the distance between them increases, the power will diminish ;
and that the equal divisions on the scale which records this distance will, when mul-

--tiplied by the factor j,, ^ive the corresponding changes in the magnifying power.

 It is therefore sufficient to determine, with a dynameter, the magnifying powers

when the lenses are in contact, and when most widely separated, and by simple pro-
portion to tabulate the intermediate divisions and corresponding powers. By having
two or three eye-lenses, which can be slipped {not screwed) into their cells, the
 range of powers is very considerably increased. Thus in our micrometer, eye-lens
No. 1 extends from powers 261 to 134 ; No. 2, from 135 to 78 ; and No. 3 from

 71 to 48.

  --To produce a double image, two prisms of rock-crystal the one cut in the direc-
--tion of its optical axis, the other transversely thereto are cemented together, so as

 to form an achromatic solid of double refraction. Six such prismatic solids, of con-
 stant angles from 2474" to 192'', are in our micrometer fitted into brass caps, which

mare made to slip on, front of the eye-lens; so that if the separation of the images

 is too great, the prism ran be immediately changed for another of a less constant
 angle, and vice versa. The double image is therefore formed after the telescope

 has performed its office, and is much cleaner and more distinct than in the original
 contrivance of Rochon, the inventor, who placed his prisms between the eyepiece

and the object-glass. No wings or coronte trouble the observer as with divided eye-

 glass micrometers; and althoughof course half the light is lost by the duplication of
 the image, the tedious additions of clock motion and illumination of the field are
 dispensed with. Indeed, the loss of light sustained by the use of illumination
 barely sufficient to render the spider lines of a wire-micrometer visible, far exceeds
 that occasioned by the transmission of the rays through good prisms of rock-crystal.
 Perhaps the whole secret of the excellence of this micrometer lies in the position of
 the crystal being before instead of behind the eyepiece.

    On viewing a double star through the Ocular Crystal Micrometer, two pairs will

 be seen, the four members of which must be brought into the same straight line
 by turning the crystal round in its cell. The measure is then made by varying the
                                                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                     21

magnifying power, i. e. the distance between the two lenses, until the four stars

appear equidistant. If the power be too small, the middle space will be greater than

that between each pair of stars ; if too great, the reverse. When the four are, how-

ever, satisfactorily adjusted and the scale read off, the measured angular distance is

equal to the constant angle of the crystal divided by the magnifying power employed.

By placing the four stars at equal intervals, the double distance will be measured,

and the uncertainty of a contact between two perhaps very unequally bright stars

avoided, which is highly desirable. It is therefore of the utmost importance to know

the constant angles of the prisms, also the limits of magnifying power of the variable

eyepiece, with all possible accuracy. It does not enter our purpose here to discuss

the various methods recommended by Dr. Pearson for determining these instrumental

constants ; suffice it to remark, that when once found they are not liable to change,

and their investigation is by no means difficult.

   The observation of position angle, though less certain than that of distance, is
at least equal to what can be made with any other kind of micrometer. For this

purpose a fine diametral line is cut across the flat side of the field lens, which be-
comes visible when screwed into the focus of the eye-lens. This line must be ad-

justed by running the double star, or if more convenient any adjacent bright one,

along its entire length. This done, the prism, which is attached to the vernier of the

position circle, must be moved round until the two images of the line are seen in co-
incidence, when the reading will be the zero-point of the position circle. For these

two operations the field requires illumination, though not for the absolute measures.

The four stars seen through the prism must next be brought into the same straight
line, as in the measure of distance, when the difference between the circle-reading

and the zero previously found, plus or minus ninety degrees, will give the angle of

position. Unless the equatorial adjustments of the telescope have been very cor-

rectly made, it is better to take half the number of zero readings before, and half

after those of position, so as to eliminate any change of the zero arising from the

alteration of hour-angle during the observation.

  A temporary defect in our micrometer, which could not be remedied without part-

ing with it just at the time most convenient for its use, prevented the observations

Aof angle of position being made.                                            few only were attempted, but sufficient to show

that good results may be expected in this coordinate also when the micrometer is

put into working order. But as the observations appended are to be regarded merely

as examples of its capabilities as a distance-measurer, under unfavourable conditions,

and by no means in the light of a series of scientific results, it would not be render-

ing justice either to the instrument or to the observer to add the few imperfect angles
of position obtained, and they have therefore been omitted.

   No kind of micrometer is so suitable to, or convenient for, an unprofessional
astronomer, who cannot enjoy the luxuries of an observatory ; and it is no exaggera-

tion of its merits to say, that any good portable telescope, so equipped, will enable

its possessor to compete successfully with far larger instruments in fixed observatories

not so provided. To prove this point, it is only necessary to refer to the annexed
observations of well-known double stars, measured on different nights, frequently

with different crystals, and therefore perfectly free from any pre- occupation of mind.
As first attempts with a strange instrument, they are naturally open to great im-

provement                                           but  with practice  and  care,  it  seems  reasonable  to  hope  that  differences
                                                 ;

exceeding half a second, or for small distances a twentieth part of the measured

space, will rarely, if ever occur.

   It is a striking proof of the excellence of the Smythian telescope, that with an

aperture of only 36 inches, with the light diminished by the duplication of the image,

and by its transmission through tolerably thick prisms of rock-crystal, powers over

200 were so readily usable. Its definition is beyond all praise : without the prisms,

it bears a power of 400 well, and separates the closer double stars in a Dianner

which puts to shame many much larger telescopes.

   To arrive at a general conclusion as to the accuracy attainable with this micro-
meter, agreeably to the sixty-Jive observations here given, we shall find that for the
mean power 1527, and mean distance 7''-67, the probable error of one observation,
based upon five measures, will be 0""086.

   Also, if we suppose the accuracy to increase in direct proportion with the power,
the extreme difference to be expected amongst ^ue such observations, taken with a
magnifying power of 200, will be 0"'21.

On the Distribution of Heat in the Interior of the Earth,
        By Dr. F. A. Siljestrom, of Stockholm.

Both the plutonic and volcanic phenomena are generally ascribed to causes residing

within the earth's solid crust, whilst the interior fluid mass is taken into con-

sideration only with regard to what Humboldt calls its " reaction." Without dis-

puting this way of explaining the phenomena-- though I really think it liable to

several grave objections-- I wish to call attention to a cause of dilatation (and con-

traction) that certainly exists, or at least has existed within the fluid mass itself, and

which, I think, must be considered as an important item in this question.

It seems impossible originally not to suppose difl^erent temperatures in different

parts of the fluid earthy mass. Considering the great absolute temperature, as well

as the immense bulk of the earth and other circumstances, differences as great even

as 100° C, nay more, can in no way be regarded as improbable. The natural con-

sequence thereof was the formation of currents, by means of which differently heated

parts were brought together, and the temperature of the mass was made more and
more uniform. However, on various grounds I conclude that even now the tem-

perature cannot be one and the same through the whole fluid nucleus of the earth,

but that currents of the said description still exist in the interior of our planet.

This assumed, let v, v' be the volumes, and t, f the temperatures of two differently

heated fluid parts, which are mixed together, and which, for more simplicity, may

be regarded as having the same mass and as being of the same chemical nature.

Let, further, w be the volume and T the temperature of each after the mixture. As

both the dilatation and the specific heat change with the temperature, let A, e be

the mean dilatation and the mean specific heat between the temperatures t and T,
>Tand A', e' between and < (i being
                                     O- Hence it follows that

                       ».=m;(i+A(^-T))

                       »/=w(i-A'(T-0)

                       (<-TJe=(T-Oe'.

and consequently that

                       ,,  ,,         »«(<-- n(Ae'-A'e)

                                     ,

                                                                                                     e-\-e

Now v+v being the original volume and 2w the volume after the mixture, it will be

seen that there must needs be a change of volume, unless Ae'=A'e, which at least is
not the case with the substances, for which Dulong has determined the variations of
dilatation and specific heat.

   If we take as an example the values found by Dulong for iron between 0°-- 200°,

it will be seen that if only jpooqo,, of the earth's volume were subject to the above-

named process of mixture-- one part being considered 200° warmer than the other--
the result would be a change of volume certainly not less than five or six times the
whole bulk of Vesuvius. This may in some way be illustrative of the quantity of
action that might be supposed. As to the absolute intensity and the mode of work-
ing, I think no other force could be imagined more suited to the purpose.

An Account of some Experiments on Radiant Heat, involving an Extension
            o/"Prevost's Theory of Exchanges. By B. Stewart.

   These experiments were performed with the aid of the thermomultiplier, the source
of heat being for the most part bodies heated to 212°. Four groups of experiments
were considered. Group the first contains those experiments in which the quantities

of heat radiated from polished plates of diiFerent substances at a given temperature,
are compared with the quantity radiated from a similar surface of lampblack at the
same temperature. The result of this group of experiments is, that glass, alum, and
selenite radiate about 98 per cent, of what lampblack does ; thick mica, 92 ; thin
mica, 81 ; and rock-salt only 15 per cent. The second group of experiments was
designed to compare together the quantities of heat radiated at the same temperature
from polished plates of the same substance, but of different thicknesses. The result
of this group was, that while the difference between the radiating power of thick and
thin glass is so small as not to be capable of being directly observed, there is a per-
ceptible difference between the radiation from thick and thin mica, and a still more
marked difference between the radiation from plates of rock salt of unequal thick-
ness. The third group of experiments was made with the view of comparing the
radiations from various polished plates with that from lampblack, as regards the

--quality of the heat, its quality being tested by its capability of transmission through

a screen of the same material as the radiating plate. From this group of experi-

ments it appears that heat emitted by glass, mica, or rock-salt is less transmissible
through a screen of the same material as the heated plate than heat from lampblack,
this difference being very marked in the case of rock-salt, which only transmits about

one-third of the rays from heated rock-salt. The common opinion that rock-salt is
equally diathermanous for all descriptions of heat is therefore untenable. The fourth

group of experiments shows that heat from thick plates of glass, mica, or rock-salt is
more easily transmitted by screens of the same nature as the heated plate than heat

from thin plates of these materials. It was shown that all these experiments may

be explained by Prevost's theory of exchanges, somewhat extended. This extension

--consists of the following laws : 1. Each particle of a substance has an independent

radiation of its own equal in all directions and without regard to the distance of the
particle from the surface of the body. 2. The radiation of a particle equals its
absorption, and that for every description of heat. 3. The flow of heat from within
upon the interior surface of a polished plate of indefinite thickness is proportional to
the index of refraction of the body, and that for every description of heat. The bear-
ing of these experiments on Dulong and Petit's law of radiation was then attempted
to be traced. It was shown that unless bodies from simply being heated change
their transmissibility for the same description of heat (which there is no reason to

suppose), the radiation of thin plates or particles at a high temperature will bear a

--less proportion to the total radiation of that temperature than at a low, the conse-

quence will be, that the radiation of single particles will increase with the tempera-

ture in a less degree than Dulong and Petit's law would indicate. It may even be
that the radiation of a particle or very thin plate may be proportional to the abso-

lute temperature of that particle. Taking a piece of glass or mica, therefore, at a

low temperature, as it is very opake with regard to the heat radiated by itself, we
may suppose that the total radiation consists of that of the outer layer of particles
only, that from the inner layers being all stopped by the outer. At high tempera-
tures, however, we may suppose that there is not only the radiation of the outer

layer, but also part of that of the inner layer which has been able to pass, swelling
up the total radiation to what it appears in Dulong and Petit's experiments. This

way of looking at radiation may possibly bring the radiative power of particles to

obey the same laws with the conducting power of particles, which Prof. Forbes has
shown decreases with an increase of temperature. The author of this communica-
tion is indebted to Prof. Forbes for the use of the instruments and substances era-
ployed, and also for many valuable suggestions with regard to the experiments it

contains.

  On the Intensity of the Terrestrial Magnetic Force. By J. Drummond.

variation the dip is at a minimum about 8 a.m., at a maximum about 11 a.m., after

which it decreases to a minimum again about 2 p.m. Turning now to the intensity,
the maximum is found to occur about 8 a.m., and the minimum about 11 a.m., after
which it again increases, reaching a maximum in the afternoon. From these facts,

then, it would appear that, while the earth exerts a greater attracting power over the

needle about 11 a.m. than either before that hour or after it, the intensity of the

force by which this is accomplished is then at its minimum. In other words, we are

mum --driven to the conclusion that the earth exerts a greater attracting power by a mini-
        of force than by a maximum, a conclusion entirely at variance with all our

knowledge of the magnetic force. This anomalous result the author traced to the

assumption lying at the foundation of the present theory of the intensity, viz. that

the  terrestrial  force  is exerted in the  direction of the  dip                   and  from an analysis of
                                                                                 ;

the phenomena of the dip he arrived at the following laws :

1. That the direction in which the earth's force is exerted, is, at all points upon its

surface, in the radial line of its centre.

2. That the vibrations of a horizontal needle being therefore at all points made at

right angles to the direction of the force, their number at any two or more stations

in similar times, or at different periods in similar times, indicates exactly the ratio of

the foi'ce at each station and at each period.

On the Development of a Physical Theory of Terrestrial Magnetism, an out-

  li?ie of which was subinitted to the Dublin Meeting. By J. Drummond.

--The fundamental principle of this theory was the following : Assuming the

prevailing idea regarding the early condition and present state of the globe, viz.

that it has cooled down from a state of fluidity, and now consists of a solid crust

enclosing a molten nucleus, the author assumed also that the sun, moon, and

other planetary bodies must exert the same influence upon the enclosed fluid which

they exert upon the surface ocean in producing the tides ; that, consequently, a

system of internal tides must be occasioned simultaneously with the external

tides. Further, accepting the theory of Gauss, that the entire matter of the globe

is magnetic, he concluded also that the passage of these internal waves must

occasion corresponding changes in the position of the needle ; and reasoning from

these premises, he arrived at the following conclusions, in regard to the changes

Ain position which the needle ought to undergo.               declination needle at any

station resting on the line of the magnetic meridian ought, upon one of the

internal waves coming from the eastward, to make an excursion to meet it ; as the
crest of the wave approaches the station of observation, the needle ought to return

with it ; and when it comes immediately beneath the point of observation, the needle

ought to coincide again with the meridian. As the wave proceeds westward, the

needle ought to follow it, making a westerly excursion equal to the easterly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and as
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the wave passes further west, and its influence over the needle thereby declines, the

latter ought slowly to return again to the meridian. Again, an inclination needle

ought to begin slowly to dip as the crest of the wave approaches the station of

observation, reaching its maximum when the wave is immediately beneath it, and

slowly rising again to its former position as the wave passes westward. And the

intensity, as indicated by the oscillating needle, ought to increase as the crest of the

wave approaches the station, reaching its maximum when it is immediately beneath

it, and decreasing gradually as the wave proceeds to the westward, the maximum of
intensity thus coinciding with the maximum of inclination. Taking into considera-

tion the conditions under which a system of internal tidal waves must be produced

and propagated, the more important of which were pointed out, the author was of

opinion that the results of observation fully coincided with this theory.

                          By J. P. Gassiot, V.P.R.S.

    If the tube of a well-constructed water-hammer is partly covered with two sepa-
rate coatings of tinfoil, and the coatings are connected, one with the outer, and the
other with the inner terminal of an induction coil, a discharge will be observable

through the centre of the tube in the form of a wave line. On repeating this expe-
riment, I ascertained that the vacuum in the tube was very much deteriorated. I

could no longer produce that peculiar bubbling in the ball of the apparatus which is
always attainable by gently heating the tube with the warmth of the hand ; this

bubbling was originally very sensibly perceptible in the tube I now exhibit when I

first received it from the maker, Mr. Casella. I have repeated the experiment with
other water-hammers, and always with the same result ; but I have not yet opened
one to examine whether the vapour has been decomposed, and gas evolved.

   At the close of the reading of the paper, the room was darkened, and Mr. Gassiot,
^^ssisted by Mr. Ladd, exhibited the experiment.

  On the Phosphorescent Appearance of Electrical Discharges in a Vacuum

      tnade in Elint and Potash Glass. By J. P. Gassiot, V.P.R.S.

   The discharge from an induction coil, when taken in a vacuum tube made of flint-

glass, has (under certain conditions) the property of rendering the glass highly phos-
phorescent, the phosphorescence being denoted by the intense blue colour of the

glass with which the stratifications are surrounded. On trying the discharge in some
vacuum tubes I had obtained from M. Geissler, of Bonn, I observed that the phos-
phorescence was no longer blue, but was of a slight green colour. To test whether

this difference was due to the gaseous matter remaining in Geissler's tubes, or to the
character of the glass which he uses, I had Torricellian vacuums prepared in German
glass tubes, and in this manner ascertained that the difference in the colour was
entirely due to the character of the glass : that of Germany is, I believe, made with
potash, and is entirely free from any lead, while in the English flint-glass lead is in-
troduced to some extent. I have recently obtained a vacuum tube from Bonn, which
shows this difference in a very beautiful manner : the outer ends of the tube are com-
posed of German glass, the centre of the tube is of English glass ; by this arrange-
ment the contrast between the two is very manifest.

Oti an Improved Induction Coil. By W. Ladd, Chancery Lane.

Having been rather extensively engaged for the last two years in the manufacture

of induction coils, and having received the constant and able advice of Mr. J. P. Gas-

siot, and the practical suggestions of Mr. C. A. Bentley, I have thought that a brief

description of the machine as it is now made, with the results obtained, may not be

Mvuninteresting.  object has been not to make very large machines, but to obtain

the greatest results from a three-mile coil, that being sufficiently large for all ordi-

nary purposes. I find the best length for the iron core to be 13 inches and about

168 diameter, composed of fine iron wire not larger than No. 22, very carefully

annealed. The primary wire should be of sufficient size to carry freely the whole of

the battery current, and of sufficient quantity to saturate thoroughly the iron core

with magnetism. For this purpose I use three layers of one continuous No. 12

copper wire carefully annealed: if more layers are used, I find that the secondary

wire is removed too far from the magnetic influence. The secondary wire ought not

to be larger than No. 35, covered with silk, which must be laid on perfectly even
and insulated from the primary wire, and also from the layers of the secondary next

to it. I find the best insulating medium to be the thinnest gutta percha made, and

which I believe to be the only gutta percha sold which cannot be adulterated ; it is

true that it has many minute perforations, but by laying on at least six thicknesses

between each layer of wire perfect insulation is secured. The greatest care must be

taken in protecting the ends of the layers so as to prevent the sparks passing from
one to the other. The condenser should be at least fifty sheets of tinfoil of about

1 square foot in size. These sheets must be separated from each other by three

sheets of varnished paper or gutta-percha tissue. Every alternate sheet of foil is
conccted together, thus forming two poles, to be attached one to each side of the

--break. It may be placed at the bottom of the stand or in a separate box, the latter

I prefer. In developing the power of the machine, everything depends upon the con-
tact breaker, which should be capable of retaining contact until the whole of the mag-
netism is obtained, and capable also of breaking contact as soon as the smallest

quantity is induced. These results are obtained in the break attached to this instru-

meiit. The hammer is made to vibrate freely between the iron core and the coil, and

the brass screw terminating with the platinum plate at the back of the hammer : a very
small amount of magnetism will be sufficient to attract the hammer, and so break

the contact. If, now, I bring this screw (placed half-way up the spring carrying the
hammer) to bear upon the spring, it will have the effect of pressing the two platinum

plates together, so that it takes a greater amount of magnetism to separate them.
By this means I can regulate the power of the instrument to the purposes for which
it is required. The battery I employ is a five cells of " Grove's," with immersed
platinum plates 5X3, having an exposed surface of 140 square inches. With such a
battery and a coil thus constructed, I can always ensure sparks from half an inch to
4 inches in air. The machine now exhibited contains six miles of wire, and, worked
with the same battery, gives 6^-inch sparks. The position which the induction coil
is now taking in this electrical age is one of considerable importance. It has awakened
new philosophical ideas, and is being successfully applied to practical purposes of
the highest advantage to mankind. For blasting purposes, a three-mile coil is capa-

ble of firing fifty charges simultaneously. But important as its present position is,
and successful as its past application has been, there can be little doubt that machines
can be constructed that will obviate the necessity for employing such ponderous
machines, and still more ponderous batteries that have been at work on the Atlantic

Cable.

this magnetic element has a minimum in the winter.

              On the Perihelia and Ascending Nodes of the Planets.

                    By Edward Joshua Cooper, F.R.S.

   It is known to many that my attention has been called to the distribution, in helio-

centric longitude, of the perihelia and ascending nodes of the planets since the year

1850. In 1851, the then results were published by me, in my Preface to 'Cometic

Orbits.' Since that period I communicated the further results, arising from subse-
quent discoveries of asteroids, to the Royal Astronomical Society and the Royal
Society. The last notice which I communicated to the Royal Society was in the
last year, when the number of known planets was 51. This notice was accompanied
by diagrams of their positions. At present there are 62 j but no elements of the last

have been yet, I believe, computed. Taking, then, 61 of these, we find that the
perihelia of 42 are found in the semicircle of heliocentric longitude, between 0° and
180^ and only 19 in the other semicircle. With reference to the ascending nodes

of the 60 planets. 42 are likewise found between 0'' and 180°, and only IS in the
remaining semicircle. But the accompanying Table will show some more remark-

able results, VIZ. that when there were only 4 known asteroids and 7 large planets,
--28 REPORT 1858.

if we add to them Neptune, making 12 in all, the perihelia of 10 of these are found

between 0° and 180° ; and of the nodes of the 11, none are in the semicircle 180° to
360°. This Table also exhibits these somewhat singular facts, that, adding to the
first 12 those subsequently discovered in groups of 10, the number of perihelia and
number of ascending nodes in each semicircle are almost exactly similar. I would

also observe, that it may be seen, by the diagrams of heliocentric longitude, that the
perihelia and ascending nodes are frequently grouped together in a remarkable man-
ner. I deal now entirely with facts : causes I leave to the more learned in celestial

dynamics.

to X Ursse Majoris, and was about 6° long at least, but the strong moonlight pro-

bably obliterated the fainter portion."

On the Results of the Pleasures of Gamma Virginis for the Epoch 1858, as
      determined by Admiral Smyth. By John Lee, LL.D., F.R.S.

  AI had the honour of presenting to Section of this Association at Dublin, in 1857,

the results of measurements of the double star y Virginis for the epoch 1857, and I now

have the gratification of presenting similar results of the position and distance of this
important double star y Virginis, for its last apparition, as observed at the Hartwell
Observatory, with corresponding results obtained at Greenwich by Prof. Airy, at Had-

denham by Mr. Dawes, at Tarn Banks, by Mr. Fletcher, and atWrottesley by My Lord

Wrottesley. The discrepancies are certainly greater than might have been expected
under the present easy slate of the object, but on the whole a very satisfactory epoch
is gained. Although stars had been telescopically observed in close juxtaposition as

early as the middle of the seventeenth century, the firm settlement of the physical

theory of double stars by observation and reasoning was reserved for Sir William
Herschel, whose sustained and indefatigable researches from 1779 to 1820 form the
broad basis of our present sidereal astronomy. Of the whole of the numerous ob-
jects which compose his invaluable contributions to this crucial branch of knowledge,
one of the most interesting and momentous is assuredly the star y Virginis, whose
observed and computed places have generally been found to agree within the limits
assigned to probable errors of observation. This star now presents a system which

--affords, by actual changes both in angular velocity and distance the former varying

--inversely as the square of the latter, with the elliptical orbital elements deducible

therefrom incontrovertible evidence of the physical connexion of its constituent

members. This binary star has been very assiduously watched by various astrono-

mers, especially during the last thirty years ; and the obtained results are converting
probability into demonstration respecting its being subject to the same dynamical

forces which govern our own system. Every advance tends to prove the universality

of the Newtonian influence of attraction, obeying the Keplerian law of areas. In a

word, by warranting the conclusion of the inconceivable extent of the controlling

agency of gravitation, it forms a wonderfully sublime truth in astronomical science.

On a New Variable Star (R. Sagittarii), discovered ivith the 5 foot Smythian

   Telescope of the Hartwell House Observatory. By N. Pogson. \Com-

   municated by John Lee, LL.D., F.R.S.)

   On the limit of a rich and widely-spread group of stars. Professor Argelander of
Bonn observed one of the 8^ magnitude, in his zone No. 227, on the night of

August 7th, 1849. Exactly seven years later, while carefully charting in the vicinity,
I found the assigned position unoccupied; but entertaining no suspicion of vari-
ability, supposed an erratum to exist in the published zone, and simply noted the

star as " missing." On July 3rd of the present year, while looking over my chart

with the Smythian telescope (quite forgetful of the above-named circumstance), I
was struck by finding a fine star nearly of the eighth magnitude not previously
recorded ; a micrometer was immediately applied and some observations taken with

the aid of a sidereal chronometer kindly lent me by the Royal Geographical Society;

these however served only to establish its fixity, thereby proving that it was not one
of the small planets, but most probably a new variable star. Subsequent compari-
sons of its brightness with five stars in the same field of view, have since confirmed

this conclusion.

bine to render mere estimations of magnitude worthless for determining the period
of a variable star. It is therefore best to select a number of comparison stars,

ranging in magnitude from the maximum brightness of the variable, to the minimum

visibilfi of the telescope, and if possible in the same field of view, to assume the
mean of several estimations of these comparison stars, made on different nights, as
correct, and so to note the difference of magnitude between the variable and such

of the comparison stars as most nearly agree with it in brilliancy. By (his means
small variations which must otherwise escape notice may be satisfactorily detected,
and a change amounting to a whole magnitude cannot possibly be overlooked. The
following observations of the new variable star were by this means obtained :

1858, July 3 ... 8'2 magnitude.  August 1            9'4 magnitude.

   Combining these with Professor Argelander's in 1849, and with my own records of

invisibility in 185G, it appears most probable that seven maxima occurred between
August 7th, 1849, and July 3id, 1858 ; in which case the period will not differ much
from 465 days, and the next maximum will fall due in September or October 1859.
It would, however, be premature to state this as anything more than a probable

surmise, only to be decided by further observation.

  My --" dear Sir, One of the first results which I obtained from the observations

made in your observatory at Makerstoun, was the annual law of variation of the
horizontal force of the earth's magnetism ; the law, namely, that the force was a
maximum near the solstices and a minimum near the equinoxes. This law was

--communicated by me to the British Association in 1845, confirmed by a discussion

of the Toronto Observations for 1842 ; it was also confirmed by the results for other

years at IMakerstoun, in a paper read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, January 5,
1840. T afterwards further confirmed it by the results of observations made at

Munich, by Dr. Lamont, in the years 1843-45. Persons interested in these questions

who have examined plate 4 accompanying the paper already cited, must have re-

marked the symmetrical and well-characterized curves (No. 8), which represent the
movement of the daily mean force from the beginning of January till the end of
March, 1844. It must have appeared curious that Makerstoun should have been

the only place where such curves have been produced, or, at least, that no other
place has shown anything resembling them. The ei'Vibition of the annual law de-
pends so much on a permanent magnet, an undisturbed instrument, and well-cor-

rected observations, that it may have seemed less curious that diff"erent results for
this period should have been obtained. As I was satisfied that the curves referred
to were real representatives of the daily variation of force, I was anxious to compare
carefully other observations for the purpose of showing to what extent the law was
similar at other places. After I had arranged anew the observatory of His Highness

the Rajah of Travancore here, and established another on the highest peak of our
Ghats, I commenced an examination of the observations made at Trevandrum in

1844 by my predecessor, the late Mr. Caldecott. These observations had never been

corrected for temperature, nor indeed had the coefficients been determined ; and on

my first researches, as the observations did not quite satisfy me, I put them aside.
On discussing them carefully, however, about a year ago, having determined the

necessary corrections myself, I was much gratified to find that the results at Trevan-
drum in 1844 agreed perfectly with those at Makerstoun. This fact I announced in

--the following terms in a letter sent to England in the beginning of this year : ' The

relative changes of mean horizontal force are the same all over the globe ; and the
changes from day to day of the mean horizontal force at difi^erent places on the earth's

surface are nearly equal, the unit in each case being the whole value of the horizontal

force at the place. In other words, the changes of mean horizontal force from day
to day are in the same direction all over the globe, and are proportional to the hori-

zontal forces at the places ; the difl"erent effect of disturbance due to its diurnal

period and the different directions of the secular change being allowed for.' It was

--attempted in this paragraph to give a general statement of the result, I shall attempt

here to be somewhat more definite. The chain of observatories of the British
Government confirmed and extended the result first due to Celsius and Graham, and
afterwards to Arago and Kupffer, that magnetic perturbations are felt simultaneously

--at places widely distant ; but the conclusion did not go beyond this it appeared

that even for moderate disturbances of one element at one place, some element, it

might not be the same, showed disturbance at the other place. Having satisfied

myself of the great similarity of the variations of force at Trevandrum and Makers-
toun, I could have no doubt but the same result would be obtained from moderately
good instruments at other places ; I accordingly undertook the discussion of obser-
vations at Hobarton, Van Diemen's Island, the Cape of Good Hope, and several
other places. As I had to obtain the temperature coefficients and to correct the

observations by my own processes, the reductions were necessarily laborious. I first

corrected the observations at Hobarton, and compared the monthly mean values at
the two stations. I found not only that the annual law was the same at the two
stations, Makerstoun and Hobarton, but that the changes of the individual monthly
means followed generally the same law throughout the years 1844, 1845, 1846, 1847,
and 1848, though the diurnal series of observations at Makerstoun were incomplete
in the last three years. The secular change seems to obey the same law at both
stations, but the amount is greater at Hobarton than Makerstoun. This will be
seen by comparison of the monthly means in parts of the horizontal force at the re-.

spective places for the year 1845 :

  An examination of the means given above will show that they follow similar laws

at both places, the average variation of the amounts of difference from month to month
being only about one ten-thousandth (yoiiro) of the whole force, a change that

would be produced by a variation of half a degree Fahrenheit in the temperature of
the mat^net ; and this amount includes the differences due to different secular change
and different effect of disturbance. The above numbers, however, are far from giving
an idea of the great resemblance in the monthly mean variations at the two places.
It will be some evidence of their agreement, that I was enabled, after projecting the
mean annual curves for Hobarton and Makerstoun, to point out that two monthly

--means for Hobarton were probably inaccurate. An examination of the printed

observations showed that this was the case that one monthly mean was erroneously
calculated, the other error being probably typographical. The former error was less
than two scale divisions, or a quantity which would be produced by a change of 2°
Fahr. in the temperature of the magnet. As it was desirable to compare the monthly
mean variations more minutely than can be done from the twelve values for each year,
I combined the observations in a manner differing somewhat from that hitherto
adopted. The usual plan has been, in examining the variation from month to month,

to employ only those values corresponding to the middle of the months, or the means
of the observations from the first to the last day of each month ; and in order to
obtain from these, the law of variation, the epochs of maximum and minimum, the
means are projected, a curve being passed through or among the points ; or the
means are considered functions of the line of the sun's longitude and the values for
different epochs are calculated. Where merely general results are desired, and where

the means for a number of years are combined, either process is sufficient ; but
neither is satisfactory when we wish to note the changes of force as they exist for
short periods. For this purpose, I have obtained the means of the observations made
from the 1st to the 28th inclusive, from the 2nd to the 29th, and so on ; so that if
observations had been made on every day of the week, we should have in this way

a monthly mean corresponding for its middle point to each day of each month, each

--period containing a lunation. The result obtained was as follows : ^the monthly
--mean values of the horizontal forceof the earth's magnetism at Makerstoun, Hobarton,

Trevandrum, &c., obey the same law, the minute variations of the monthly mean

being shown similarly at all the places, but the relative amounts of the changes are

sometimes greater at one place, sometimes at another.

   I was now led to consider the variations of the daily mean magnetic force. In the

observations issued from the Colonial observatories, the daily means for eachGottingen

astronomical day are given: atMakerstoun and in several other observatories, the civil

day of the place has been taken. Both methods have advantages ; a disadvantage of
the former method is, that as no observationswere made on Sundays, some observations

--made on Saturday had to be combined with some observations on Monday to form one

of the six daily means in each week, so that one daily mean in six was not comparable
with the mean of any other place not in the same meridian. It was obvious, how-

ever, that for my purpose one daily mean from twenty-four hourly observations was

insufficient ; it was necessary to obtain a daily mean for each hour, as I had obtained

a monthly mean for each day. Thus I combined the twenty-four observations from
midnight on Sunday till 11 o'clock on Monday night for the first mean of the week,
1 A.M. till 12 P.M. of Monday for the second mean, and so on. In this way 120
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.     S3

daily means were obtained for each week. It was not possible, however, for me to
reduce and discuss the observations for a long period in this way j I therefore limited
myself, as regards the changes of mean daily force, to the six weeks commencing

January 28, ending March 9, 1844, to which period belongs one of the most symme-

trical curves projected in plate 4 already cited. I performed this discussion for six

places included within the latitudes of 42° South and 55° North, and I found that

the changes of daily mean force from day to day followed, on the whole, the same

law at all the places. The differences and the exaggeration of some of the move-

ments, especially in high latitudes, seem to depend on the different values of the dis-

turbance at different places ; but so exactly do the curves in their general forms (and

frequently in their more minute inflexions) follow each other, that we might, were

the curves for each place presented separately, suppose that they were the same

curve. The sudden changes, and, indeed, with a few exceptions, all the turning

points, occur nearly simultaneously over the globe within the limits considered.

There seems to be a period of about two days and a half, or of about sixty hours,

for which I can offer no hypothesis. This period is exhibited more markedly some-

times near the equator, sometimes in high north latitudes ; but in general Hobarton

has the movements slightly smaller than the other stations ; but this may depend on

the epoch of the year. I can see no connexion between these points and the posi-

tion either of the sun or moon. I can form no other hypothesis than this, that they

exhibit the variations of the intensity of a distant magnet. If we suppose a power-

ful magnet to act at a distance by induction on a smaller magnet, we might expect

that the laiv of distribution of magnetism in the smaller magnet would be unaltered,

and that the variation in the force of the inducing magnet would be shown on the

induced magnet. If the induced force were small compared with the proper force

of the induced magnet, the variation due to induction at any point might be taken

as proportional to the force at that point. This conclusion is not far from the result

of these discussions. The whole range of the curve of February 1844, may be re-

presented approximately by 11 at Hobarton, 122 at Trevandrum, 13 at the Cape of

Good Hope, and 14 at Makerstoun, the unit in each case being 0'00014 of the whole

horizontal force at the place. The values of these forces are approximately, in Eng-

lish units, 4"5, 7'8, 4"5, 3'4. The total forces are approximately 13"6, 8'1, 7'6, 10*5.

The comparative values of the range given above cannot be quite accurate ; they

depend on the unit coefficient of the instruments having been accurately determined,

which is by no means certain in most cases. Even on the theory suggested, it should

be remembered that the inductive capacity may vary in different parts of the terres-

trial magnet. The differences of the mean movements are small, however, when we

consider that the law and amount of disturbance vary with the latitude. Indeed,

the general agreement of the curves at different places lead one to conclude that the

vertical force, and therefore the total force as well as the magnetic dip, obey the

same laws. The diurnal variations of the magnetic declination may be supposed due

to two opposing forces acting at right angles to the magnetic meridian. From a

comparison that I have made between the daily mean values of the magnetic decli-

nation at Makerstoun and Hobarton, I conclude that the mean declination also fol-

lows similar laws, the north end of the declination magnet moving generally in the

same direction at both places. The variations of the daily mean force from hour to

hour are felt simultaneously on all meridians, and, as I have said, they appear to be

independent of the position of the sun or moon. Within the limits specified, then,

we may say that the magnetic intensity of the earth increases as a whole or dimi-

nishes as a whole : it does not increase at one place and diminish at another. These
results are quite different from those for the variations of hourly mean force. The

latter varies with the latitude and the sun's position (longitude and hour-angle).

The horizontal force is greatest near the equator shortly before noon ; it is least at
the same time in high latitudes. If we suppose, then, that the variations of daily

mean force are due (for instance) to the varying force of the solar magnet, we must

conclude that it acts on the whole terrestrial magnet simultaneously, so that there is

an increase or diminution of force everywhere at the same time. This hypothesis,

however, will not explain the diurnal variation, and we must suppose that it is pro-

duced by a wholly different mode of action. I have suggested that these variations

are due to the inducing action of the sun shifting the isodynamic lines, the direction

of the lines, and of the shift determining the epochs of maximum and minimum. It
is, indeed, obvious that the result is equivalent to a movement of these lines ; but

whether the inducing action is experienced by the earth's surface, or its atmosphere,
was not evident. I think I can prove satisfactorily that the diurnal variation is not
due to the sun's heating power, whether on the earth's surface or its atmosphere

but that it may be due to the sun's magnetic action on the atmosphere, is, it appears
to me, much more probable. I have said in the letter already referred to that the

diurnal variation of the magnetic declination is least near the equator where the dip-

--ping-needle is parallel to the terrestrial axis, so I believe it will be found that the

diurnal variation of dip and of force is least in mean latitudes, where the dipping-

needle is aearly perpendicular to the earth's axis.

       Sound.

On the Mathematical Theory of Sound. By the Rev. S. Earnshaw.

   The author adverted to the circumstance, that the only impediment to the com-
plete development of the mathematical theory of sound has hitherto been the dif-

_l(=u--ficulty of integrating the partial differential equation (-^|i. As an ap-

But the author suggested that the legitimacy of that step is by no means evident
and that the true test of the allowableness of it is a knowledge of the change which

may be the exact equation of motion. In this way it will be seen whether the physical

=change, represented by assuming (-ij 1, be of such a minute character as to be

allowable. From this it was inferred that the equation which represents the proper-

assumption, though analytically allowable, is not allowable in the problem of sound,

is that in that assumption quantities are neglected which (in the case of sound)

not an approximation, and from it nothing can be inferred but that the assumption

=(-^j  1 is not admissible. The result of this reasoning is, that the equation

= + fy F(x at) A- (x--at), which has hitherto been the basis of explanation in

treatises on Sound, has nothing whatever to do with sound, but represents the

motion of a wave in an imaginary elastic medium of a constitution very different
from that of the atmosphere and of all known gaseous media. The mathematical
theory of sound is consequently put back to its differential equations, beyond which
not an inch of ground can be maintained. Till the differential equation is integrated

=accurately, without assuming /-ij 1, no advance can be made, and science remains

without a mathematical theory of sound. The author then announced that he has
succeeded in integrating the differential equation of sound without approximative
assumptions ; that he has, in fact, obtained its exact integral ; and in the result has

possessed himself of the key to the various properties of sound. Among several

other things, it was stated that the exact integral accounts for the great difficulty

--which experimenters have found in obtaining accordant velocities of sounds, for

--gress, and proves that the velocity with which a sound is transmitted through the

atmosphere depends on the degree of violence with which it was produced, and not
(as in light) on the length of the wave ; so that sounds of every pitch will travel at
the same rate, if their genesis do not differ much in violence ; but a violent sound,

as the report of fire-arms, will travel sensibly faster than a gentle sound, such as the

human voice. This last property the author stated to have caused him much trouble,

in consequence of its being directly opposed to the testimony of almost every expe-

rimenter. F"or many affirmed, as the direct result of their observations, and others
assumed, that all sounds travel at the same rate, Fortunatelj^ it transpired at the

Meeting, that in Captain Parry's Expedition to the North, whilst making experiments

on sound, during which it was necessary to fire a cannon at the word of command
given by an officer, it was found that the persons stationed at the distance of three
miles to mark the arrival of the report of the gun, always heard the report of the
gun before they heard the command to fire ; thus proving that the sound of the gun's

report had outstripped the sound of the officer's voice ; and confirming in a remarkable
manner the result of the author's mathematical investigations, that the velocity of
sound depends in some degree on its intensity.

                              Meteorology.

          On the Formation of Hail, as illustrated by Local Storms.
                          By W. R. BowDiTCH, B.A.

With the fourth or fifth flash of lightning fell hailstones which averaged from half

an inch to an inch in diameter. These hailstones accompanied every flash, which

appeared to come from the zenith to the place where I was standing; but as soon as

the storm had passed away so far that the interval between the flash and report was

appreciable, the hail either did not reach us, or but a very few hailstones fell mingled

with heavy rain. Between the flashes rain only fell : with the flash came a volley of

hailstones, and gradually a few drops of rain would mingle with the hail, until at
length rain only was falling. The transition from rain to hail was sharp and well-

defined ; that from hail to rain very gradual.
   llie hailstones which fell were of three kinds :

I. Solid balls of ice having two or three small bubbles, or one larger one contain-

ing air.

II. Balls of which from half to two-thirds consisted of solid ice, the remainder

being water and air enclosed in a crust of ice.

III. Balls formed of an outer crust of ice containing water and air. In some

instances this icy crust was so thin as to be broken by the fall (though all which I

examined fell upon straw), while in others it was thicker, and bore considerable

pressure before it broke.

In form the hailstones were spheroidal, sensibly bulged at the part corresponding

to the equator on a globe, and depressed at the parts corresponding to the two tro-

pics and the arctic and antarctic circles ; and in many, if not all, cases slightly

Myelevated at the two poles.  attention was specially directed to this latter point,

and although in some instances the elevation (if any) was insufficient to warrant a

judgment without measurement, in many no doubt whatever could be entertained,

for the polar portion was evidently tending to form a point. It appeared as if the

drop had been originally a perfect sphere, which, by rotation on its own axis had

become formed as found, and had then suftered congelation. The bulging towards

the equator, and the elevation at the poles appeared the complements of the depres-

sions above described.

The regularity and perfection of form of these bodies forbid the notion of gradual

accretion in their descent, and put beyond question the fact of their form being due

to the action of a natural law upon fluid bodies placed in the same circumstances.

It is to be hoped that other observations, or direct experiments, may enable us to

ascertain whether this is the normal form of drops of water falling freely and rapidly

retical considerations in explanation of the formation of hail.

              Further Evidence of Lunar Infiuence on Temperature.

                         By J. Park Harrison, M.A.

    In illustration of the effects of lunar influence, the author adduced proofs of the
frequent recurrence of high and low temperatures on the same day of the moon's
age, and also at shorter lunar intervals, not only at Greenwich and Dublin, but at

Madras, Toronto, and the Cape of Good Hope. He also expressed his belief that

the fall in temperature which takes place at full moon, before first quarter, and
shortly after last quarter*, is due to the clearing of the atmosphere at those periods,
and the higher temperature about the period of new moon and first quarter to a
more clouded state of the sky, the eiFects observed being attributed to the action of
terrestrial radiation. In a subsequent communication attention was drawn to the
very different degree of heat which the moon's crust attains at first and last quarters
and to the general clearness of the sky at the periods of greatest fall in temperature
in the months of January and May.

             On the Decrease of Temperature over Elevated Ground.
                        By Professor Hennessy, F.R.S.

   The author showed that the decrease of temperature in ascending through the
atmosphere depended not only on height above the sea-level, but also upon the abso-
lute height above the nearest surface of solid land. As the temperature of the air
at any point depends not only on the pressure at that point, but also on the amount
of heat which may be transferred thither by circulation and radiation, it must be a
function of the several elements upon which these calorific influences depend. It
must therefore vary with the distance of the point from heating or cooling surfaces,
as well as with its height above the sea. It will also depend upon the time of the
day, and even on the season of the year, for the energy of the causes referred to is
manifestly subjected to periodical variations depending upon the position of the sun.
The increase of temperature observed in ascending for short distances above the
ground during the night, and even sometimes during the dayf, will thus have its
anomalous character explained. In this way the decrease of temperature over plains,
mountains, and plateaux would be necessarily very different ; and we cannot imme-
diately infer the state of the phenomena in the two latter instances from what may
exist in the former. Some of the results of observations made on the hills and
mountains of Ireland during the Ordnance Survey, as contained in the volume recently

published by Col. James, were referred to as illustrations of these general views.

On the Heating of the Atmosphere by Contact with the Earth's Surface.

                    By Professor Hennessy, F.R.S.

Tlie temperature of the atmosphere depends principally on the heat which the earth

Areceives from the sun, and on what it loses by radiation.  portion of the solar heat

is absorbed in passing through the air, while another portion penetrates to the earth's

Surface. Tlie ground becomes thus heated, and the lower strata of the atmosphere

acquire the greater part of their heat from contact with the warmed surface. It is

admitted that the mode in which the air becomes heated by contact with the ground

must be a kind of circulation analogous to that seen in the movements of a heated

mass of liquid, such as boiling water. When studying the vertical movements of

the atmosphere, with reference to which Prof. Hennessy had made a communication

to the Association last year, he had been led to consider the connexion between such

movements and the influence of the heated ground. In order to study the ques-

tion experimentally, thermometers were suspended at different heights above the

ground, and under different circumstances of exposure to the influence of the sup-

posed currents. Observations were made every minute, and sometimes every half
minute, during short intervals, about the middle of the month of May, on days when
the sky was clear, and during which there was consequently a great deal of solar
radiation. The following are the principal results observed: the mercury in each
thermometer rose and fell alternately during intervals varying from about half a
minute up to six minutes. The extent of the oscillations was sometimes very con-

siderable in thermometers freely exposed to the air ; the mercury sometimes rising
or falling nearly three degrees in three minutes. In general the thermometers
exhibited fluctuations of temperature, the intensity of which diminished the more
they were protected from the influence of circulating currents in the air. The great-
est fluctuations were presented by thermometers with blackened bulbs exposed in the
sun. This arose from the circumstance that the blackened bulbs, by acquiring a
high temperature, became themselves disturbing agents in the calorific conditions of
the surrounding air. Evidence of similar phenomena appears to be presented by
the curves of temperature obtained by the aid of photographical registration at the
Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford. The application of photography to the continuous
registration of atmospherical conditions, has been carried out in that Observatory

with so much care, and has been attended with such remarkable success, as to have

already allov^red its able director to deduce results of considerable interest in meteor-

ology. Among these are results, which observations made merely at stated hours

Would probably never have disclosed*. Attention has been called by Mr. Johnson
to a remarkable serration in the temperature curves during the day. This serration
is found only when there is a considerable amount of solar radiation ; it disappears
during sunless and cloudy weather. While it is explained by referring it to the in-
fluence of the solar heat upon the ground, and the consequent circulation of small
atmospheric currents, it affords a very satisfactory confirmation of the trustworthi-
ness of the photographical method of registration.

   The following Table presents a specimen of the observations made on May 11

with two thermometers, one of which (a) had its bulb plunged 0'25 inch below the
open mouth of a bell-glass, and the other (6) was freely suspended in the air.

              Note on Refraction. By CoXoneX 3au^s, F.R.S.

   Colonel James, Director of the Ordnance Survey, referred to the results obtained
in the course of the trigonometrical operations of the survej'. It was found that the
refraction of the atmosphere was very great in the morning, that it diminished
towards the middle of the day, and then again gradually increased towards evening ;
this he attributes to the greater amount of aqueous vapour in the lower portion of
the atmosphere in the morning and evening, as compared with the amount in the
middle of the day.

On the Daily Comparison of an Aneroid Barometer with a Board of Trade
            Barometer by Captains of Ships at Sea. By Dr. Lee.

   The author submitted tables of considerable length detailing the results that had

--been obtained during a voyage from London to Madras and back again, and the

conclusions he made were as follow : That aneroid barometers, if often compared
with good mercurial columns, were similar in their indications, and valuable; but at
the same time it ought to be remembered that they were not independent instru-
ments; that they were set originally by a barometer; required adjustment occasion-
ally ; and might deteriorate in time, though slowly. The aneroid was quick in
showing the variation of atmospheric pressure, and to the navigator (who knew at
times the difficulty of using barometers) this instrument was a great boon, for it
could be placed anywhere out of harm's way, and was not affected by the ship's

motion, although faithfully giving indication of increased or diminished pressure of
air. The aneroid, which is exhibited, had been carefully and daily observed by Cap-
tain Toynbee, of the ' Gloriana,' during his recent voyage to Madras.

On the Construction of a Portable Self-registering Anemometer for recording

   the direction and amount of Horizontal Motion of the Air. By F.

    OSLER, F.R.S.

    In this instrument the direction of the wind is obtained by fans, similar in prin-

ciple to those at the back of a windmill, as in some anemometers now in use, and
the horizontal motion by Dr. Robinson's revolving hemispherical cups. The mode
of registration, however, is such as to enable the instrument to be constructed much
more compactly than heretofore. The direction of the wind is recorded by means of

three pencils inserted in an endless band, or flat chain working over two pulleys of
equal size, one of which is on the same shaft as the vane, and revolves with it ; the
distance between the centres of the pulleys, and also between the pencils, being equal

to the circumference of one pulley, that is to one revolution of the vane. By this

arrangement one of the three pencils is always making its record on a small hori-
zontal cylinder, over which passes a long band of metallic paper about 5 inches wide.
The cylinder, being connected with the shaft turned by the revolving cups, moves at
a rate proportionate to the velocity of the air; Stationary pencils rule lines on the
paper as it is wound forwards by the motion of the air, and indicate the cardinal
points. Upon the margin of the paper, a pencil moved by means of a clock records
the time, the quantity of paper worked off in any given time showing the amount
of horizontal motion of the air during that period. The instrument can be supplied
with a single length of paper sufficient to last for several weeks, and this paper being
what is termed metallic, small brass wires slightly rounded at the end are used as
pencils. The whole of the registering portion of the instrument is contained in a
cyhndrical case about 10 inches in diameter, which protects it from the weather, so
that it does not require the erection or alteration of a building to carry it, but can be

placed for action in any situation that may be desired.

                              Note on Observations of Temperature,

                    By Dr. F. A. Siljestrom, of Stockholm.

   In a discussion of thirty years' meteorological observations at the Observatory of
Stockholm, I have pleaded the necessity of taking meteorological media for shorter

periods than a month, which latter seems to me to be quite unfit as a meteorological
period. I have divided the year in seventy-two parts, viz. each month in six parts
of five days (except the last part of the month, whose length varies between five and
six days, and for February between three and four). By this means I have not
only been able to ascertain quite decided laws in the yearly movement of the tem-
peratoie, which never could have been detected by monthly means (for instance,
three very well-defined minima during the winter, a quite remarkable sinking of the
tcm[)erature in the beginning of May, &c.), but also to show the intimate connexion
between the changes of wind and temperature, and to find, in a somewhat new

manner, a confirmation of Dove's celebrated " Drehungsgeschichte." But it is

impossible here to enter into further details.

On the Desirableness of renewing Balloon Ascents in England for Meteoro-
                 logical Objects. By Colonel Sykes, F.R.S.

   With reference to the desirableness of renewing the balloon ascents, I shall limit

myself to a very few words. The Section is aware that in 1852 the Kew Committee
of the British Association effected four ascents. The observers who fearlessly went

up in the balloons, were Mr. Welsh, Mr. Nicklin, and the veteran aeronaut Mr.
Green. The results of the observations were published in the ' Philosophical Trans-

actions;' and Mr. Petermann, in the ' Mittheilungen,' has given a coloured diagram,

from which, by a coup d'ceit, the accordances or discordances in the results of the

four ascents at the different heights at which the same temperature occurred, are
seen. 55° and 32° are sufficiently marked. The four ascents took place from Vauxball
Gardens, near London. The temperature of 55° on the different days was met with

at 6800, 3900, and 950 feet respectively. At the fourth ascent, on the 10th of
November, the temperature at the surface of the earth was below 55°. The freezing-

point in the two ascents in August, occurred at 13,200 feet ; on the 21st of October,

Nowat 10,900 feet ; and on the 10th of November, at 8500 feet.  these differences

may be owing to the different angles of the sun on the respective days of observation,
and It would not be prudent to consider the indications as normal conditions. Again,

the rapid diminution of temperature in the upper portion of the ascents leads to the

inference of an almost inconceivably low temperature at the surface of the earth's

atmosphere. It was found, also, that the tension of vapour, which at the surface of

the earth was very considerable, at nearly 23,000 feet was scarcely appreciable.

All meteorological investigations require so many repetitions to ensure trustworthy

results, that I cannot believe that the Mathematical Section will consider investiga-

tions into the conditions of the upper strata of the atmosphere exceptional. I trust,

therefore, that 1 only anticipate the wishes of the Section, when I express a hope

that it will recommend to the General Committee to cause another series of balloon

ascents to be undertaken.

Particulars of an Ascent of Mont Blanc. By Professor Tyndall, F.R.S.

   The author spoke particularly of the enthusiasm of a guide named Balmat jn the
cause of science, and of the efforts that that person had already made towards the
--40 REPORT 1858.

advancement of it. He also referred to the fact, that the professional guides, headed

by their chief, sought to prevent his going without the usual complement of guides,

making no allowance whatever for the circumstance that he was engaged in purely

scientific pursuits. This man (Balmat) had conceived the idea of placing on the top
of Mont Blanc a thermometer, for the purpose of noting the minimum winter tem-

perature that might occur at that altitude, and the author had been instrumental in

obtaining £l5 from the Royal Society for the prosecution of that object. But this

man was of so independent a nature that he would accept no gratuity, and the result

was, that after paying <i^lO for necessary expenses, the remainder was to be returned

to the Royal Society.

   The author gave in detail the difficulties he had to overcome in ascending

Mont Blanc. He said that the snow, which at that height was like dry dust,

was wafted on that day by the wind, and came in great force against the party on

the summit. The temperature was 20° below the freezing-point, and the effect was

that the eye-lashes and beards of the party were covered by long ice-crystals. In

this ascent Balmat's hands had been frostbitten, and up to this time they had not

recovered their natural functions.

He then remarked on the obstructions that were encountered by scientific men

making observations at iVlont Blanc, on account of the arbitrary proceedings of the

Alocal authorities.    remonstrance was, however, in process of being drawn up, and

he hoped it would have due weight with the Sardinian Government. The guide

Balmat was now being prosecuted by the chief guide, on account of his not having

acted in accordance with the unreasonable interpretation which the chief guide put

upon the printed instructions, and it behoved the Association to render him every

assistance for the sake of science.

   On afresh Form of Cri/slallizadon which takes place in the Particles of

         Fallen Snow under Intense Cold. By J. Wolley, M.A.

   In passing a winter in Lapland, it is impossible, whether in observing the tracks
of animals, or merely considering day by day the condition of the roads for sledging,
or of the snow for the use of snow-skates, not to be struck by the very variable cha-
racter of the snow, partly caused by winds and fresh falls, partly by the condition of
the rime or hoar frost upon the surface, but mainly, as it is soon found, by an alter-
ation in the character of the mass of fallen snow.

   In Lapland, as elsewhere, the snow as it falls is of several kinds. But whatever its
character, it at first lies more or less lightly on the ground, and if the weather is still
and not very cold, it may so remain for days ; but if the cold increases, the snow
rapidly sinks ; it becomes at first like sand, is crisp to the tread, bears the smaller

animals, and soon becomes suitable for the skidor or snow-skates. When the cold

has continued, probably many degrees below zero of Fahrenheit, for two or three
weeks, not necessarily consecutive (the phenomena are more especially to be observed
in the cold months of January and February), the snow beneath the surface is found
to be made up of large pieces of a quarter or a third of an inch in diameter, glitter-
ing in the sunshine, clear, heavy, highly moveable upon one another, and seen upon
even a hasty examination to be of a beautiful crystalline structure. On a closer in-
spection, they are found to be somewhat irregular in shape, with the outhne of more

or less complete hexagons with sides of unequal length ; they are formed around
nuclei by no means placed centrally, often quite where one side of the hexagon
should be; and they grow in layers of bars one outside the other, often larger in
section as well as longer as they recede from the nucleus ; these bars (learned

gentlemen will excuse me for not describing a crystal more properly) are free from

one another except at the angles ; those of each layer lie in one plane, often not the
same as the layer which preceded thena lies in. At the angles are usually small
crystalline projections, rising apparently perpendicular to the general surface of the

crystal. These crystals are broken with a slight force ; and many of those where the
snow has been crushed have lost their nuclear portion, but retain the true hexagonal

form.
    Snow, in the ondition of which I hope to have given at least some faint notion, is

called liieta lumi, or f and-snow, in the Finnish language. It yields more water ; and

hence, even when it is covered by more recent snow, the Laps take the trouble of
digging down to it to fill their kettles with. These primitive people also use it in its

dry state for washing or cleansing their clothes. After first ex|)osing to the external
cold for some hours the dresses they wish to purify, for reasons which I need not
further explain, they beat them with sticks upon and under a heap of sand-snow.

   When the winter covering of the ground is in this sandy condition (perhaps the
moveable state of such shell-sand as that of John o'Groat's house may best repre-

sent it in one respect, and the appearance of a bag of clean crystals of salt give some
idea of it in another), it is a great advantage to all the animals of the country in sup-
porting their weight, and is a special comfort to the reindeer, from the facility with
which they can remove it with their fore-feet so as to get at their food beneath.
Though intensely cold to a naked hand, it is much better than fresh snow for lying
upon, as it does not yield too much to the weight of the body, and does not get into
the nicks of the clothes, or melt in the fur. I may mention, that with only a thick
pair of stockings on, one can walk for some little distance from a bivouac without
risk of getting either wet or cold in the feet ; and before a fire in the woods this
snow never becomes sloppy, but seems to disappear only by evaporation, which
greatly adds to the facilities of passing the long winter nights in a Lapland forest.
The same thing is in a great measure true in the spiing ; the snow is very rarely to
be found in that miserable state which marks the breaking up of a snow in England.

   Concerning the formation of these crystals, I made experiments by burying in the
snow at certain intervals of time, chip boxes, some empty and some containing fresh

snow : I was prevented from fully carrying out and registering my observations, but

I found that the changes went on in the boxes equally with the external snow, and
in the boxes that contained nothing but air, but nevertheless were not so tightly

closed as to prevent the transmission of air containing water in solution, crystals
attaching themselves to the sides and top, but never to the floor of the box, which

crystals greatly resembled those in the snow ; they were, however, often much

longer, even to upwards of half an inch in length. In the course of ray observations, I
found that^this sand-snow formed principally in open places, on lakes, bare soils, &c.,
growing less on spongy grounds, scarcely at all upon logs of wood or outbuildings.

    Address by Sir J. F. W. Herschel, Bart., President of the Section.

TuoDGH it is with much satisfaction that I find myself placed in the Chair of this Sec-
tion, it is a feeling not untempered with serious misgivings. On none of the occasions

when I have attended the Meetings of the British Association, has it ever been in my

power to be present at any Session of the Chemical Section ; and attached as I have
always been to that branch of science, and contemplating with the most lively sympathy

the labuin-s of its more active members, this has been to me a source of great regret and
disappointment. And now when the opportunity I have always so earnestly desired
is accorded me in its fullest extent, it comes accompanied with the painful feeling of

occupying a position, which probably not one of the distinguished cultivators of the
4? REPORT 1858.

science whom I See around me, would not be more competent to fill "with credit to

himself and satisfaction to the Section. However, in this respect, I must throw my-

self on your indulgence. If there be any conventional usages in the conduct of the

business of the Section, which have grown up as matters of habitual arrangement,

and been ascertained by experience to facilitate its working, with which I am un-
acquainted, there are those around me who will good-naturedly set me right.

  --But there is one deficiency which I feel very much : it is the want of that thorough

acquaintance, that sort of coup d'oeil extending over the whole area of the vast field

of chemical, mineralogical, and agricultural research which the objects of this Section

embrace, which would justify me in the ambitious hope that I could command your
attention as I am aware that my predecessors in this Chair have done on some former
occasions, while placing before you a summary of the progress made since our last

meeting, in these branches of knowledge, and delineating the leading features of their

present, and the prospects of their future state. In this I should be sure to fail, and

mythereibre I shall not attempt it, though I cannot help giving expression to  surprise

and admiration of the astonishing developments which they have undergone, I will

not say since the time when my own acquaintance with chemistry commenced by
lianging in rapt enthusiasm over Macquer's Dictionary (which seemed to me in those

early days a work of little short of superhuman intelligence) ; nor since the epoch
when a Uavy electrified the world by the decomposition of the alkalies ; nor that when
a Faraday commenced his magnificent career of discovery ; nor when a Berzelius first

--showed what might be done in giving precision to analysis but since organic che-

mistry has assumed, by the experiments and reasonings of Dumas, Liebig, Hofmann,

and its other distinguished cultivators, that highly abstract and intellectual form, under
which it now presents itself, and which, by the links of the platina bases, and com-
pounds such as those described by Gibbs and Genth under the name of the ammonio-

cobaltic bases, and by those which are every day coming into view by tlie mutual in-

terweaving, if I may use such an expression, of the organic and inorganic systems of

composition in bases such as those of the metallic ethyls and those of boron and silicon

-- seems to place these conceptions in much the same sort of relation to the ordinary

atomic theory as put forth by Dalton and Higgins, and the elementary notions of

oxide, acid, and base of Lavoisier, that the transcendental analysis holds to common

algebra.

   And here perhaps I may be tolerated if I put in a word of reclamation against
the system of notation into which chemists, who are not always algebraists, have

fallen in expressing their atomic formulae. These formuke have been gradually

taking on a character more and more repulsive to the algebraical e3'e. There is a

principle which I think ought to be borne in mind in framing the conventional nota-
tions as well as nomenclatures of every science, at every new step in its progress, viz,

--that as sciences do not stand alone, but exist in mutual relation to each other, as it
--is for their common interest that there should exist among them a system of free

communication on their frontier points, the language they use and the signs they

employ should be framed in such a way as at least not to contradict each other. As

the atomic formulae used by the chemist are not merely symbolic of the mode in

which atoms are grouped, but are intended also to express numerical relations in-

dicative of the aggregate weights of the several atoms in each group and the several

groups in each compound, it is distressing to the algebraist to find that he cannot in-
terpret a chemical formula (I mean in its numerical application) according to the

received rules of arithmetical computation.

    In a paper which I published a long time ago on the Hyposulphites, I was parti-
cularly careful to use a mode of notation which, while perfectly clear in its chemical

sense, and fully expressing the relations of the groupings I allude to, accommodated
itself at the same time perfectly well to numerical computation, no symbol being in
any case juxtaposed, or in any way intercombined with another, so as to violate
the strict algebraical meaning of the formula. This system seemed for a while likely

to be generally adopted ; but it has been more and more departed from, and I think
with a manifest corresponding departure from intelligibility. The time is perhaps

not so very far distant, when, from a knowledge of the family to which a chemical

element belongs, and its order in that family, we may be able to predict with con-

iidence the system of groups into which it is capable of entering, and the part it will

Afilay in the combination.        great step in this direction seems to me to have been

utely made by Prof. Cooke, of the Harvard University of the United States (in a

memoir wliich forms part of the fifth vokune of the Memoirs of the American Aca-

demy of Arts and Sciences), to extend and carry out tlie classification of chemical

elements into families of the kind I allude to, in a system of grouping, in which the

first idea, or rather the first germ of the idea, may be traced to a remark made by M.

Dumas, in one of his reports to this Association, and which is founded on the prin-

ciple of arranging them in a series, in each of which the atomic weight of the ele-

ments it comprises are found among the terms of an arithmetical progression, the
common difference of which in the several series are three, four, five, six, eight, and

nine times the atomic weight of hydrogen respectively. So arranged, they form six

groups, which are fairly entitled to be considered natural families, each group having

conuiion properties in the highest degree characteristic; and what is more remark-

able, the initial member in each group possessing in every case the characteristic pro-

perty of the group in its most eminent degree, while the others exhibit that property

in a less and less degree, according to their rank in the progression, or according to

the increased niunerical value of the atomic equivalent. Generally speaking, I am a

little slow to give full credence to numerical generalizations of this sort, because we

are apt to find their authors either taking some liberties with the numbers themselves,

or demanding a wider margin of error in the application of their principles, than the

precision  of  the  experimental  data  renders  it                    possible  to  accord                                 so  that  the  result  is
                                                                                                                         ;

more or less wanting in that close appliance to nature which makes all the diflerence

between a loose analogy and       a  physical  law                     but  in this  instance                                   it  certainly  does
                                                                    ;

appear that the groups so arising not only do correspond remarkably well in their

theoretical numbers with those which the best authorities assign to their elements,

but that it really would be difficult to distinguish the elements themselves into more

distinctly characteristic classes by a consideration of their qualities alone, without

reference to their atomic numbers.

   When we find, for instance, that the principle affords us such family groups as

oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine self-arranged in that very order; or

--again, nitrogen, phosphorus,- arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, when we find that it

packs together in one group all the more active and soluble electro-positive elements,

hydrogen, lithium, sodium, and potassium, and in another the more inert and less

--soluble ones, calcium, strontium, barium, and lead, and that without outraging any

other system of relations, it certainly does seem that we have here something very

like a valid generalization ; and I shall be very glad to learn in the course of any dis-

cussions which may arise on such matters as may be brought before us in the regular

conduct of our business from those more competent to judge than myself, whether I

have been forming an overweening estimate of the value and importance of such

generalizations. I will only add on this point, in reference to what fell from our

excellent President in his address to the assembled Association last night, that

this kind of speculation followed out, would seem to me likely to terminate in a point

very far from that which would regard all the members of each of these family groups
as allotropes of one fundamental one, inasmuch as the common diflerence of the
several progressions which their atomic weights go to make up, are neither equal to,
nor in all cases commensurate with the first terms of these progressions. For instance,
in the chlorine group, the first term being eight, the common difference is nine.
Something very different from allotropism is surely suggested by such a relation. It
would rather seem to point to a dilution of energy of one primary element by the

superaddition of dose after dose of some other modifying element; and this the more
strikingly, since we find oxygen standing at the head of very distinct groups having

very striking correspondences in some respects, and very striking differences in others.

   But all these speculations take for granted a principle, with which I must confess I

think chemists have allowed themselves to be far too easily satisfied, viz. that all the
atomic numbers are multiples of that of hydrogen. Not until these numbers are de-

--termined with a precision approaching that of the elements of the planetary orbits,

precision which can leave no possible question of a tenth or a hundredth of a per cent.,
and in the presence of which such errors as are at present regarded as tolerable in the

--atoniic numbers of even the best determined elements shall be considered utterly in-

admissible, I think, can this question be settled ; and when such gigantic conse-

-- --quenceSj so entire a system of nature is to be based on a principle, nothing short of

such evidence ought, I think, to be held conclusive, however seductive the theory

may appear. I do not think such precision unattainable, and I think I perceive a

way in which it might be attained, but one that would involve an expenditure of

time, labour, and money, such as no ]>rivate individual could bestow on it.

If the phenomena of chemistry are ever destined to be reduced under the domi-

nion of mathematical analysis, it will, no do\ibt, be by a very circuitous and intricate

Weroute, and in which at present we see no glimpse of light.  should, therefore, be

all the more carefuU)' on the watch in making the most of those classes of facts, which

seem to place us, not indeed within view of daylight, but at what seems an opening

that may possibly lead to it. Such are those in which the agency of light is concerned

in modifying or subverting the ordinary affinities of material elements, those to which

the name of actino-chemistry has been affixed. Hitherto the more attractive appli-

cations of photography have had too much the effect of distracting the attention from

the purely chemical questions which it raises ; but the more we consider them in the

abstract, the more strongly they force themselves on our notice ; and I look forward
to their occupying a much larger space in the domain of chemical inquiry than is the

case at present. That light consists in the undulations of an etherial medium, or at

all events agrees better in the characters of its phenomena with such undulations, than

with any otlier kind of motion which it has yet been possible to imagine, is a pro-

position on which I suppose the minds of physicists are pretty well made up. The

recent researches of Prof. Thomson and Mr. Joule, moreover, have gone a great way

towards bringing into vogue, if not yet fully into acceptation, the doctrine of a more

or less analogous conception of heat. When we consider now the marked influence

--which the different calorific states of bodies have on their affinities the change of
--crystalline form effected in some by achange in temperature, the allotropic states taken

--on by some on exposure to heat, or the heat given out by others on their restoration

from the allotropic to the ordinary form (for though 1 am aware that Mr. Gore considers

his electro-deposited antimony to be a compound, I cannot help fancying that at all

--events the state in which the antimony exists in it is an allotropic one), when, I say,

we consider these facts in which heat is concerned, and compare them with the facts

of photography, with the ozonization of oxygen by the chemical rays of the electric

spark, and with the striking alterations in the chemical habitudes of bodies pointed

out by Draper, Hunt, and Becqucrel ; and when, again, we find these carried so far,

that, as in the experiments of Bunsen and Roscoe, the amount of chemical action

--numerically measures the quantity of light absorbed, it seems hardly possible not to

indulge a hope that the pursuit of these strange phenomena may by degrees conduct

us to a mechanical theory of chemical action itself. Even should this hope remain

unrealized, the field itself is too wide to remain unexplored ; and to say nothing of

discovery, the use of photography merely as a chemical test may prove very valuable,

as I have myself quite recently experienced, in the evidence it has afforded me of the
presence in certain solutions of a peculiar metal having many of the characters of

arsenic, but differing from it in others, and strikingly contrasted with it in its powerful

photographic qualities, which are of singular intensity, surpassing iodine, and almost

equalling bromine.

There is another class of phenomena, which, though usually considered as belonging

peculiarly to the domain of general physics, and so out of our department, seems to

--me to want some attention in a chemical point of view ; it is that of capillary attrac-

tion. The coefficient of capillarity differs very remarkably in different liquids, and

--no doubt also in their contacts with different solids; a fact, which can hardly be

separated from the idea of some community of nature between the capillary force and

those of elective attraction. I hardly dare to hint at the existence of some slight

misgiving I have always felt as to the validity of the received statical theory of capil-

lary action, which carries with it the authority of such names as those of Laplace and
Poisson. Any discussion of this point would be matter for another Section of this

Association ; and if I here touch upon it, it is only to observe that my impression of

the requisiteness of a force so far allied to chemical affinily as to be capable of satura-
tion, rests on other grounds besides that of the mere diversity of action above alluded
to. But I must remember that you are not met here to listen to generalities, of what-
ever nature, but that we have plenty of real and special business before us.

                    On Colorific Lichens. By J. Bedford.

   The lichens specially referred to were those used in the manufactui'e of orchil and
cudbear. The author stated that prior to the year 1838, all the lichens employed
were such as grow upon rocks only. In that year, however, a new kind of lichen was
introduced from Angola on the west coast of Africa, by Mr. F. R. Batalho, a Lisbon
merchant, to whom much credit is due for the discovery of its properties and uses.
The novelty consisted in its being a tree lichen, as previously all such had been found

useless for this manufacture.
    In 1839 another tree lichen, possessing valuable colouring properties, was discovered

by Mr. G, C. Bruce in Ecuador, South America, and brought into the market in
1810, under the name of Lima Weed.

   Similar lichens are now imported from Loango, Benguela, Mozambique, and Mada-
gascar, several of which are considered to be of equal or even of more value than the
best quality of rock lichens. The result has been to reduce the market price of

orchil weed from about ^300 to ^50 per ton ; and now tree lichens form something

like four-fifths of the total quantity consumed in the manufacture.
   The author exhibited illustrative specimens of rook lichens from the Canary and

Cape de Verde Islands ; also from Madeira, the Azores, and Sweden, together with
the tree lichens from the places above-mentioned.

On the peculiar action of Mud and Water on Glass, as more especially

illustrated by some Specimens of Glassfou7id i?i the Lake at Walton Hall,

Bynear Wakejield, the residence o/' Charles Waterton, Esq.  C. W. Bing-

LEY, Ph.D., F.C.S.

   Along with several other articles lately found in the lake at Walton Hall, near
Wakefield, the residence of Charles Waterton, Esq., were some specimens of glass,
supposed to hav£ been submerged in the lake ever since the hall was attacked by
Oliver Cromwell's soldiers.

   The interest those specimens possessed in a scientific point of view consisted in the

remarkable appearance they presented after their submersion, possessing hues of

colour rivalling those of the finest specimens of pearl shells. Some of the specimens
are of a beautiful azure blue by direct light, and yellow by transmitted light ; others
of a fine green colour by reflected light, and red and pink by transmitted light
whilst others again are of a red and deep orange colour by reflected light, and blue

by transmitted light.

   On scraping the glass with a penknife, the coloured part was detached in minute

scales, those exhibiting the red and orange rays of colour coming off easily, when green
and bluish scales became disclosed to view, which were with more difficulty removed.
The glass underneath appeared as if it had been ground, or subjected to the action of

hydrofluoric acid. On analysis, the scales were found to consist of silicates of lime

associated with iron, but no potash or soda ; whereas the glass consisted of a silicate
of potash, with a very slight trace of lime and iron. The glass appeared, therefore,

to be an alkaline silicate, and much more fusible and more easily acted upon by dis-
integrating agents than the glass now manufactured. The potash originally in it

appeared, in the case of the detached scales, to have been replaced by lime and iron

derived from the water. The mud in which they had been imbedded was found ou

analysis to contain a large quantity of organic matter, containing nitrogen, and water

charged with sulphuretted hydrogen. No sulphur was found in any form, either in
the glass or in the scales. Any hypothesis, then, of the colours observed owing their

 origin to the combination of sulphur with the bases in the glass, the author observed,
 was perfectly untenable.
4i8 REPORT 1858.

    It has been known for a long time that water acts more or less upon glass, slowly
 decomposing it. Scheele, for example, observed that distilled water, which had been
 boiled a long time in glass vessels, became alkaline. Ebelmen published some time

 ago an account of the strong action of water charged with carbonic acid on glass.
 Mr. H. C. Sorby had lately shown the author some specimens of glass which had
 rapidly undergone partial devitrification during their exposure to the action of water
boiling under pressure, at a temperature exceeding 300° C. The action of water on
glass is materially assisted by the presence of ammonia. Glass in stable windows is
frequently corroded from this cause. The disintegration of the glass found in the lake
at Walton Hall appeared to the author to have arisen from the combined action of
the water and the ammoniacal and carbonic acid gases derived from the mud, assisted
by the pressure resulting from the superincumbent water. It is probable that the
transformation of the glass was produced by the silica of the glass, after the separation
of the alkali, being left in a gelatinous state, entering into combination with lime,

derived from the mud or water of the lake, to form the insoluble silicate of which the

scales were composed, analogous in composition to tabular spar.
   The author next proceeded to a consideration of the peculiar colour of the glass.

On fusing the glass, after removing the scales, it was perfectly colourless. The de-

tached scales, which were very difficult to fuse, likewise became colourless. The
coloured glass, viewed by transmitted light, exhibited rays of colour complementary
to the reflected rays. The various colours presented, therefore, doubtless owed their

origin to the different refractive powers of each of the scales ; the refractive powers
of the latter again depending on their thickness.

                   On the Expansion of Metals, Alloys, and Salts.

                        By F. Cbace Calvert> F.C.S.

   Messrs. Calvert and R. Johnson haying purified a considerable number of metal
for the purpose of ascertaining some of their properties, were desirous of testing their
expansion and contraction when exposed to certain temperatures. The apparatus
employed in making these experiments is one constructed by Mr. G. C. Lowe. It
consists of a lever with a long and a short arm. The short arm is brought to bear
upon the bar to be tested, and in the end of the long arm the object-glass of a tele-
scope is inserted. An eyepiece of considerable magnifying power is so fixed, that an

observer, by looking through it, at a graduated scale, is able to determine with the
greatest accuracy the distances through which the object-glass is displaced when heat

is applied to the bar. The parts of the apparatus are so adjusted that j^j-^dth part

of an inch expansion is represented by a definite portion of the graduated scale.

In the course of these experiments it was found that marked differences were ob-

served between the results obtained and those of previous experimenters. This was

attributed to the circumstance of the metals they were employing being in a pure

state, and this view was confirmed by trying in the same manner metals of ordinary

commercial qualitj'. They observed also that a change of the molecular condition of

a bar produced a considerable change in its ratio of expansion. Thus a bar of steel,

when tempered to an extreme hardness, has a ratio of expansion fully one-third greater

than when it is left soft from the fire ; and most of the metals have a very different

ratio according as they are cast or forged. This is particularly remarkable in the case

of pure zinc, a bar of which, when well-hammered, expands very little more than half

the amount that it expands when cast vertically. Again, the axis of crystallization has

\a considerable influence upon the expansion of bodies.  bar of pure zinc cast hoi-i-

Azontally expands much less than if cast vertically.  similar phenomenon was ob-

served also in examining other crystalline bodies. 'J'hus amongst the carbonates of

lime, statuary marble was observed to expand more than some of the metals, amongst

which are cast iron, antimony, and platinum ; whilst the expansion of chalk, in which

the particles are differently arranged, is little more than one-fourth that of marble. In

several alloys of metals a remarkable difference was observed between the expansion

found by experiment and that calculated from by the ratios of the metals of which

they were composed. Four different alloys were made and examined, and in each

the expansion observed was less than that deduced by calculation from their equiva-
                                                                                                                     ;

lenfs. In alloj's of copper with tin, it was found that where only a small quantity of
tin entcreJ into the composition of a bar, the expansion fell considerably below that

of pure copper, although the tin thus added has a much higher ratio of expansion

than copper.

Note on Nitro-glycerine and other Xyloids. By J. Baker Edwards, Ph.D.,

   Lecturer on Chemistry and Toxicology, Royal Infirmary School of Medi-

    cine, Liverpool.

   The author stated that he had made a considerable number of experiments upon
various animals to ascertain the physiological effects of these substances, some of
which he found possessed poisonous properties.

   Dr. De Vry inti-oduced the substance known as nitro-glycerine or glonoine, to the

notice of the British Association at Ipswich, and observed that from some experiments
made upon rabbits, he concluded that it was not a poison. The experiments of Mr.

Field, however, showed that it possesses a powerful physiological action upon man

and the author had in a great number of instances observed and experienced violent
and protracted headache and irregularity of the heart's action follow the administra-
tion of a single drop ; upon animals, viz. frogs, birds, rabbits, and cats, doses of from
four to ten drops produce at first similar symptoms and dilation of the pupil of the eye.
After apparent recovery from these first effects, a secondary chain of symptoms set in,
viz. vertigo, trismus, violent tetanic convulsions, lasting in some cases for three or
four hours, and then terminating in death by exhaustion. Shortly before death, ex-
treme contraction of the pupil of the eye is observed, and the animal becomes stupe-
fied and nearly unconscious ; when the animal is disturbed, however, a convulsive
paroxysm takes place, resembling that produced by strychnine.

   Similar experiments were made upon xyloidine from sugar, washed until all bitter-

ness was removed. No effects were produced.

   Upon xyloidine from starch, which produced convulsions in the rabbits ; but no

fatal effects were produced in a quantity of ten grains.
   Upon pyroxyline collodion, which produced no marked effect.
    It is possible in the latter case the ether is antidotal to the peculiar action of xyloi-

dine, for when administered to persons suffering from the effects of glonoine it affords
pronipt relief. The author had not concluded his experiments upon this subject.

A Process for the Estimation of Actinism. By R. J. Fowler.

   In the ninth volume of Gmelin's ' Handbook of Chemistry,' we find it stated that
" oxalate of ammonia mixed with aqueous protochloride of mercury is decomposed
under the influence of light, yielding sal-ammoniac, calomel, and carbonic acid;" it
is also stated that " the mixture of the two solutions remains clear in the dark, in

daylight it becomes turbid in six minutes, and in the course of au hour deposits calo-
mel, which in sunshine quickly falls down in soft flakes surrounded with bubbles of

carbonic acid. The filtrate no longer contains mercury, but chloride of ammonium and

undecomposed oxalate of ammonia."

   On seeing this, the author conceived that here might be the elements of a process

for actinonietry                                                                      the following are the results of experiments which he has tried on
                                                                                   ;

the subject.

It is perfectly correct that the two solutions named may be kept mixed unchanged
                                                                                       ;

for an indefinite period in the dark, that the precipitation of calomel begins in about
fifteen or twenty seconds in full sunshine, and that this precipitate ceases immediately
the vessel containing the solutions is removed from solar influence, showing that the
action is not continued in darkness after the chemical change has been partially effected

that the action of the actinism is not in this case calalytic. When three tubes of the

mixed solutions are exposed to pretty uniform light. No. 1 for ten minutes. No. 2
for tvpenty minutes, and No. 3 for forty minutes, the results are that the tube that had
been exposed twenty minutes contained twice the bulk of precipitate of that which
had been exposed but ten minutes, and the tube with forty minutes' exposure contained
twice the bulk of the twenty minutes. If the exposure of the solutions be continued
several hours, the vessel containing them will be completely filled with a nic^.gma of

the precipitated calomel*.

   From these experiments it is concluded that the mixture of solutions of oxalate of
ammonia and protochloride of mercury is very sensitive to light ; that as this action
of light is not catalytic, all the precipitate obtained from the solutions may be con-
sidered as being produced by solar influence alone ; and lastly, that a definite amount
of precipitate is produced by a definite amount of actinic force; thus proving that
there are elements of uniformity and certainty in the behaviour of the mixed solutions
under the influence of light, from which a certain method for estimating the actinic
force may be formed.

    If extreme delicacy be required in the estimations, the precipitated calomel might

be collected, washed, and dried ; but if this is not desired, narrow graduated tubes
might be used for exposing the mixed solutions, and the amount of precipitate read

off" after standing a certain time in the dark.

   The author used in these experiments nearly saturated solutions of the two salts,
but the formation of calomel takes place in solutions far removed from the point of
saturation ; for if a drop of solution of the protochloride of mercury containing only
,,L_j. of a grain of that salt be added to 300 grains of a solution of oxalate of ammonia
and exposed to the light, the calomel is precipitated in a light powder; and this deli-
cate reaction may therefore be used as a confirmatory test for the presence of the

protochloride of mercury.

    It would be interesting to knov^f whether the absorbed actinism of M. Niepce de
St. Victor would afliect the mixed solutions. The author has tried several experiments

in this direction, but not with sufficient success to warrant any positive assertions.

On a Method of Observation applied to the study of some Metamorphic Rochs;

  and on some Molecular Changes exhibited by the action of Acids upon them.

  By Alphonsb Gages, Curator of the Museiim of Irish Industry, M.R.I.A.

   The author, while admitting that the ordinary method of analysing rocks gives tlieir
absolute composition, is of opinion that it does not give any information as to their
genesis or decomposition. The preliminary mechanical oj)erations to which the spe-

cimens to be analysed are submitted wholly destroy their peculiar state of aggregation,

and mix up substances that may not have been in combination. He accordingly
proposes a new method of examination, which is applicable in a great many cases,

and which is capable of leading to extremely important results in connexion especially
with metamorphic rocks. His method is to expose fragments or thin laminre cut in

certain directions, or whole crystals to the action of acids, alkalies, or other solvents

for a certain time.

   The author gave several examples illustrative of his method, of which the following

are the most interesting.

--thod, yielded

Considered alone, those numbers would lead to the mere conclusion that the rock was
a dolomite; but by oi)erating on a moderately sized fragment cut in the direction of
the fibres, with dilute liydrochloric acid, for some days, a skeleton remains of asbes-
tiform tremolite having the following composition :

              Silica                             C8

              Magnesia                           29

--a result which shows that the dolomitic rock is a subsequent formation to the tre-

molite.

The new mode of conducting the examination of rocks, depending upon the me-

chanical difference of their preparation, was further advantageously contrasted by the

author. Some varieties of magnesite leave siiico-gelatinous residues, by which the

transition from meerschaum to a replacing pseudomorphite of carbonate of magnesia

maybe followed. Again, crystal of Thomsonite boiled in hydrochloric acid, deposits,

after removal of the alkali, a gelatinous transparent precipitate, and an opaline skeleton

remains, presenting the outlines of the primitive crystal, thus exhibiting the stages

of alteration through which these crystals pass. The opals found in the basaltic di-

stricts of the North of Ireland have most probably been derived from the gelatinous

silica of the decomposed zeolites, while the hydrophane of the same locality resem-

bles in a remarkable manner some skeletons artificially obtained from a laminated

magnesite derived from the decomposition of basalt, and described by General Port-

lock in his ' Geological Report.' Tliis mineral, treated by acids, leaves a skeleton of

pure amorphous silica lighter than water, and having the perfect form of the primi-

tive substance, consisting of thin laminaB superimposed like the leaves of a book.

After immersion in water for a sufficient length of time, it becomes translucent, and

acquires all the characters of certain varieties of hydrophane. If left exposed to the

air for some time, it loses the greater part of its water, but retains a mean quantity of

HOabout 6'40 per cent., which corresponds with the formula 3Si O',  given by Beudant

for an opake white opal from Castellamonte.

As an illustration of the decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of rocks, the

author referred to a pseudomorphite of laminated quartz-rock, derived from magne-

site, which, though partially crystalline, retained traces of amorphous silica. It would

appear that the original rock, after the disappearance of some of its constituents, had

been infiltrated by the silica of alkaline silicates derived from the decomposition of

trappean rocks. The petrifaction of fossil wood from the vicinity of Lough Neagh
may be referred to the same class of phenomena.

Mountain leather and cork from Londonderry, leave, when treated by acid, a light

spongy skeleton analogous to varieties of nectique quartz. All these substances are

evidently the result of a more or less advanced state of alteration of hornblendic and

augitic rocks; sometimes the decomposing silicates are entirely replaced by carbonates

of lime and magnesia, or with carbonate of lime alone, and the original mineral is

traceable only in the form of a thin superficial film on both sides of the nevvly-foi-med

carbonates. Serpentine, cut into thin laminae and treated by acids, exhibits in a great
number of instances the original mineral substance from which it has been derived.
The author concluded by stating that the simple treatment of acids acting upon thin

laminie was an eflScient means of distinguishing true serpentine, which leave a skeleton

of amorphous silica, from many rocks resemblhig the former lithologically.

On a new variety of Pyro-electric Wavellite. By Alphonse Gagks, M.RJ.A,,

                 Curator of the Museum of Irish Industry, Dublin.

   The first specimen with which the author became acquainted, was presented to him
hy Mr. G. H. Kinahan of the Geological Survey, and was part of a block found in the

drift on the banks of White River, four miles south of Loughhill, resting on coal-

measures. It was accompanied by blocks of limestone, trappean breccia, syenite and

granite. Wavellite has also been found by Messrs. Jukes and Kinahan in the lower
bed of the coal-measures, just above the limestone, about three miles north-west of

Cahirinoyle.

   The present specimen answers in some respects to the description of Fischerife or
Peganite, as given by Dufrenoy and Dana,

1858.                                                               4,

   It is composed of small crystals of an emerald-green colour, mingled with white
crystals forming mammillated concretions, cementing fragments of a quartzose grit.

   In other instances, the mineral forms the cement of a conglomerate of a hlack

chert-like variety of jasper.

   It exhibits slight pyro-electric properties. At 100° C. it loses a part of its water.

 Hence the formula 5 | pg203}3PO=-t-18HO may be deduced.
    Hermann considers Fischerite to be 2A1- O^, P0''+8H0, and the Peganite pf

Breithaupt as only differing from it in containing six equivalents of water. The

colour of this last is due to oxide of copper, but in the present case oxide of nickel is
the source. Five equivalents of the Irish mineral, plus one equivalent of Al- O^, will

be equal to three equivalents of Peganite.

   The author only proposes this formula as an expression of a single analysis; but as
a great many phosphates of alumina have hitherto been confounded with Wavelhte,
he is of opinion that a complete examination of the whole series would be a desi-

deratum.

  A conglomerate of quartz cemented by white Wavellite was also found at some

distance from the first specimen.
    It is worthy of observation, that nearly all the varieties of the mineral are to be

found in this carboniferous locality ; and as many of these appear to be of very recent
origin, it is possible that some phosphatic deposits may exist in the locality.

On Electrical Discharges as observed in highly rarefied Carbonic Acid in

             Bycontact loith Potash.  J. P. Gassiot, V.P.R.S.

The author exhibited a tube in which was placed a piece of caustic potash, and

explained that the tube had been previously charged with carbonic acid, and after
being exhausted, had been hermetically sealed. The small residuum of carbonic acid
was therefore in contact with potash. This tube, when cold, showed the stratified
discharge ; but on melting the potash, the discharge merely passed in the form of a
wave without stratifications from one terminal to the potash, and from the potash to

the other terminal. As the potash cooled, the discharge reassumed its original

appearance.             ___^_^

AddOn reciprocal Decomposition between Salts and their             Solvents.

              By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

MRIt has been recently shown, that when two salts        and M'R' are mixed in solu-

tion, a partial interchange of their component parts ensues, with the production of

amounts of MR' and M'R, depending among other circumstances on the relative

quantities of the original salts. If to such a mixture in solution, an additional amount

MR'of either  M'Ror be added, it will alter the state of equilibrium, and itself suffer
MRreciprocal decomposition, producing an additional amount of both
                                                                    and M'R' in

equivalent proportions. An acid, that is a hydrogen compound, HR, comports itself

in such circumstances in the same way as a metallic salt. Hence it may be antici-

pated that when a salt MR' which is insoluble in water is dissolved in some aqueous
MRacid, reciprocal decomposition will also ensue, and the addition of either
                                                                              or HR'

to the solution will cause a precipitate of the original insoluble salt MR'. The author

had already adduced instances, in the Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society, in
         TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                     51

which this extraordinary result does actually ensue ; he now drew attention to the

fact that it invariably occurs, and showed that the reasoning applied equally to cases

MRin which the salt MR' is not insoluble in water, but only less soluble than

or HR'.

Experiment confirmed this view ; thus, among other instances, a saturated solution

of sulphate of silver in aqueous nitric acid gives a crystalline deposit of the sparingly

soluble sulphate, if it be treated with a strong solution of either nitrate of silver or

sulphuric acid. Observations on the crystals that separate from solutions of sulphate

of soda, or of nitrate of potash, in hydrochloric acid, when similarly treated, showed at

once the influence of mass, and confirmed the conclusion that at all times four com-

pounds coexist in the solution. The authoi-'s experiments on sparingly soluble salts

dissolved in acids had all indicated that the law of reciprocal decomposition holds

good in such cases also, and had afforded additional support to the inference, that

HR MRif an acid
         MR'dissolve a salt         to saturation, the addition of either  or HR'

will cause the production of more MR' than the acid can keep in solution, and which

must accordingly precipitate or crystallize out.

The former experiment of dissolving ferric phosphate in hydrochloric acid had

been tried in absolute alcohol instead of water, with a still greater indication of the

non-conversion of the whole of the iron into the state of chloride, and an equally

clear optical demonstration that the addition of more hydrochloric acid increased the

amount of ferric chloride present.

On a remarkable Deposit of Carbonate of Lime about Fossils in the Lower
           Lias of Dorsetshire. By George Gladstone, F.C.S.

   The object of this paper was to bring before the Section some very curious speci-
mens of fibrous carbonate of lime, vphich the author found during a recent visit to
Lyme Regis.

   The lower lias shales, which are there very fully developed, are in many instances

parted by bands of fibrous carbonate of lime, some of which are less than a quarter of
an inch thick, while others are several inches in thickness : the fibre runs exactly at
right angles to the surface of the bands, through the middle of which a dividing line
generally runs, as if the deposit has originated on both the upper and under sides
simultaneously and met in the centre.

    In some places these bands are full of what appear like ammonites, having the
markings perfect on both sides, and standing in high relief, as if they were the actual

shells. On examining them minutely, however, it is found that they are composed

merely of two layers of this fibrous carbonate of lime with the shell of the ammonite in
a crushed and flattened state in the centre, the fibre of the lime still maintaining the
same direction as in the rest of the band, viz.'perpendicular to the flattened shell, and
varying in length so as to preserve all the curves and ridges which the shell had when
perfect. In one specimen, where the outer whorl of the ammonite being of stronger
texture and filled with sediment, had not been crushed, the same deposit appears,
forming a complete fringe of even thickness, and thus preserving all the form of the

shell beneath.

   Some other shells exhibited the same curious appearance, but they are much less
numerous than the ammonites, which must have swarmed at the time these beds

were deposited.

             On the Alkaline Waters of Leeds. By W. HuGGON.

   The author gave the results of an analysis of a gallon of water from Ripley's
Well, Ilolbeck. This alkaline water appears to contain a larger amount of alkaline
matter than any in England. The nearest approach to it is the water of the artesian
well in Trafalgar Square, which, according to the analysis of Abel and Rowney, con-
tains 18 grains of carbonate of soda in the gallon, and 20 grains of the whole solid

matter is chloride of sodium.

    I have examined ten of the alkaline waters of Leeds, and found them to vary in
the quantity of carbonate of soda, " which is the alkaline substance they contain,"
from 24 grains to 45 grains per gallon of water.

      On an Instrument for Measuring the Constant Intensity of Ozone.
                    By Edwin Lankester, M.D., F.R.S.

   This instrument consisted of two small rollers included in a box, which were moved
by means of ordinary clock-work. Over the roller, a strip of paper, prepared with
iodide of potassium and starch, is allowed to i-evolve, the paper becoming exposed to

the air for an inch of its surfiice, in the lid of the box. Twenty-four inches of paper
pass over the rollers in the course of the twenty four hours, which thus registers by its

colour the intensity of the action of ozone in the atmosphere. By this instrument

the intensity of the ozone for every hour in the twenty-four could be i-egistered, and
tninima and maxima with an average be ascertained. The register of ozone could also
be compared with those of the anemometer, and the relation of ozone to the direction
and force of the wind ascertained. Dr. Lankester pointed out the importance of
ascertaining the presence of ozone, on account of its undoubted relation to health.

He drew attention to a series of tables which had been drawn up from the registra-

tions of the anemometer made at London, Blackheath, and Felixstow, on the coast of
Suffolk. From these it was seen that the relation of these three places were as 0-22
and 55. The instrument acted also as a clock, and the time could be accurately marked
upon the ozonized paper.

          0}i the Annual Yield of Nitrogen j^er Acre in different Crops.

  By J. B. Lawes, F.R.S., F.G.S., and J. H. Gilbert, Ph.D., F.C.S.

    In a paper given last year at the Dublin Meeting, on the question of the assimila-
lion of free nitrogen by plants, and some allied points*, the authors had stated in
general terms, that the amount of nitrogen yielded per acre, per annum, in different
crops, even when unmanured, was considerably beyond that annually coming down,

in the forms of ammonia and nitric acid, in the yet measured and analysed aqueous
deposits from the atmosphere. The investigations then referred to were still in pro-
gress; and a desirable introduction to the record of the results would obviously be, to

illustrate, by reference to direct experiment, that which had been before only assumed,
regarding the yicW of nitrogen in our different crops. To this end the annual pro-
duce of nitrogen per acre had been determined, in the case of various crops, wlu'ch

were respectively grown for many years consecutively on the same land ; namel_v,
wheat, fourteen years; barley, six years; meadow hay, three years; clover, three

years out of four; beans, eleven years ; and turnips, eight years. In the majority of
the instances referred to, the yield of nitrogen had been estimated, both for the crop

grown without manure of any kind, and for that with purely mineral manure, that
is, excluding any artificial supply of nitrogen. It was the object of the present com-
munication to give a summary view of some of the facts thus brought to light.

   Beans and clover were shown to yield several times as much nitrogen per acre as
wheat or barley. Yet the growth of the leguminous crops, carrying off so much ni-

trogen as they did, was still one of the best preparations for the growth of wheat
whilst /a//o7y (an important effect of which was the accumulation within the soil of the
available nitrogen of two years into one), and achlhtr/ nitrogenous mamires, had each

much the same effect in increasing the produce of the cereal crops.

    Other e.xperimental results were adduced, which illustrated the fact, that four years

of wheat, alternated with fallow, had given as much nitrogen in the eight years as

eight crops of wheat grown consecutivelg. Again, four crops of wheat, grown in alter-
nation with beans, had given nearly the same amount of nitrogen per acre as the four
crops grown in alternation with fallow; consequently, also much about the same as
the eight crops of wheat grown consecutively. In the case of the alternation with

beans, therefore, the whole of the nitrogen obtained in the beans themselves, was over
and above that which was obtained, during the same series of years, in wheat alone,

-- whether the latter was grown consecutively, or in alternation with fallow.

    Interesting questions arose, therefore, as to the varying sources, or powers of accu-

mulation, of nitrogen, in the case of crops so characteristically differing from one an-

other as those above referred to.
    It had been found that the leguminous crops, which yielded in their produce such

a comparatively large amount of nitrogen over a given area of land, were not spe-
cially benefited by the direct application of the more purely nitrogenous manures.
Tlie cereal crops, on the other hand, whose acreage yield of nitrogen imder equal
circumstances was comparatively so small, were very much increased by the use of
direct nitrogenous manures. But it was Ibund that, over a series of years, only about
four-tenths of the nitrogen annually supplied in manure for wheat or barley (in the
form of ammonia salts or nitrates), were recovered in the immediate increase of crop.

Was any considerable proportion of the unrecovercd amount drained away and lost?
Was the supplied nitrogenous compound transformed in the soil, and nitrogen in

some form evaporated? Did a portion remain in some fixed and unavailable state of

combination in the soil ? Was ammonia, or free nitrogen, given oft' during the growth
of the plant? Or, how far was there an unfavourable distribution, and state of com-

--bination, within the soil, of the nitrogenous matters applied directly for the cereal

crops, those, such as the leguminous crops, which assimilated so much more, gather-
ing with greater facility, and from different ranges of soil, and leaving a sufficient

available nitrogenous residue within the range of collection of a succeeding cereal

crop ? These questions, among others, which their solution more or less involved,
required further elucidation before some of the most prominent of agricultural facts

could be satisfactorily explained.

    Comparing the amount of nitrogen yielded in the different crops, when grown
without nitrogenous manure as above referred to, with the amoiuit falling in the mea-
sured aqueous deposits, as ammonia and nitric acid, it appeared, taking the average

result of the analyses of three years' rain, that all the crops yielded considerably more,

and some very much more, than so came down to the soil. The same was the case
when several of the crops had been grown in an ordinary rotation with one another,
but without manure, through two or three successive courses. Was this observed
excess of amount in the yield over that in the yet measured sources, at all materially
due merely to the extraction by the crops, of nitrogenous compounds previously ac-
cumulated within the soil? Was it probably attributable chiefly to the absorption of
 ammonia or nitric acid, from the air, by the plant itself, or by the soil? Was there
any notable formation of ammonia or nitric acid, from the free nitrogen of the at-

mosphere? Or, did plants generally, or some in particular, assimilate this free

nitrogen ?

   As already intimated, some of the points which had been alluded to were at the

present time under investigation ; the authors having in this the able cooperation of
Dr. Pugh. Others, it might be hoped, would receive elucidation in the course of
time. There of course still remained the wider questions--of the original source, and
of the distribution and circulation, of combined nUrogen, in the soil, in animal and
vegetable life on the earth's surface, and in the atmosphere above it.

                     On the AcHoti of Hard Waters upon Lead.

                   By W. Lauder Lindsay, M.D., F.L.S.

  --It is, and has long been currently believed, 1. That where there is free access of

atmospheric air, pure or soft waters, that is waters absolutely or comparatively free
from saline ingredients, readily corrode or erode lead, and become impregnated, some-
times to a poisonous degree, with some of the salts thereof. 2. That the rapidity
and extent of this solvent or corrosive action are proportionate to the purity of the
water, that is, its freedom from neutral salts. 3. That impure or hard waters, that
 is waters containing a considerable amount of neutral salts, do not so affect or become
 impregnated with lead. 4. That such waters are prevented from acting on lead by,
 or in virtue of, their saline constituents, which exert a sort of protective or preserva-
 tive power in regard to the lead. 5. That if a given water does not within a short

 period cause a white coating on freshly-burnished lead plates or rods, it may be
 regarded as destitute of any corrosive action, and may therefore be safely allowed

 to be kept in leaden cisterns and transmitted through leaden pipes.
    The author's experiments and inquiries have led him to the following somewhat

--opposite conclusions : 1 . That certain |)ure or soft waters do not act upon lead. 2.

 That certain impure or hard waters, in some cases containing abundance of the very
 salts which are generally regarded as most protective or preservative, do act upon lead.
 3. That the rationale of the action in these anomalous or exceptional cases is very
 imperfectly understood. 4. That experimentation on the small scale and for short
 periods is "most fallacious, and frequently dangerous, in regard to the conclusions
 thence to be drawn. 5. That water may, under certain circumstances, and to cer-
 tain extents, contain lead without necessarily being possessed of poisonous action
 on the human system. 6. That water contaminated with lead may deleteriously
 affect certain members or individuals only of a community, family, or household.

 7. That the use of water so contaminated is the obscure cause of many anomalous

 colic and paralytic affections.
    One chief object of the paper is to illustrate the second of the latter propositions,

 viz. that hard waters frequently do act upon lead. The author tabulates the various
 theories or explanations that have been or that may be advanced to account for the
 action of such waters upon lead, as follows :

     1. Galvanic action from the contact of different metals, or of different qualities of
 the same metal, under water.

     2. Unusually small quantity of,
        a. The neutral salts generally, or in the aggregate.
        h. Particular neutral salts, such as the carbonates and sulphates.

     3. Use of leaden covers to cisterns.
    4. Long exposure of still water to the same surface of metal, as in the storing
 up of water in lead cisterns.

     5. Great extent of surface of metal exposed to the action of water.
     6. Unusually large proportion of carbonic acid in the water.
     7. Unusually large proportion of atmospheric air in the water.

    8. Presence of nitrite of ammonia in the water.

     9. Presence of acids, derivable from decaying or dead animal or vegetable matter.
     10. Presence of foreign bodies or accidental impurities.

    11. Chemical or electro-chemical causes, with which we are at present unac-

.quainted.

--as one of great importance, and he strongly commends it to the notice of chemists

and electricians as a subject still requiring to be worked out. It would appear that

--the necessary use of solder, the presence of portions of other metals than lead in
-- --any form in contact with lead, inequalities in the surface of the lead sheeting, the

use of lead from different factories and of different composition (as lead made with

--old solder, or containing silver unextracted), may each and all determine galvanic

action, which facilitates, to a dangerous degree, the corrosive action of hard water

ou lead. What renders galvanic action the more dangerous and the more important

is, that it is strongest in hard waters, that is, in those containing more or less neutral
salts, which, under other circumstances, would exert their usual protective influence

on the lead.

  --The paper contains several illustrations of, 1. corrosion or erosion, to such an

extent as to cause repeated leakage, of leaden cisterns, by waters of various degrees
and kinds of hardness, or containing various kinds and amounts of neutral salts ;
and 2. the poisonous action of such water, when impregnated with lead, on the

human body. It also contains a series of comparative chemical analyses, made with
a view to ascertain the condition as to hardness, or the nature and amount of the
saline constituents, as well as the action upon lead, of various waters used for culinary

and drinking purposes in and around Perth.
   The author refers to the mechanical and chemical means of protecting the lead

of cisterns and pipes against the corrosive action of water. Of mechanical means,
he gives as illustrations the coating of the lead with compositions of rosin and tallow,
or similar substances ; and the patent processes of Mr. Davis of Lambeth, London,

for lining the interior of leaden pipes with tin, or with gutta percha, caoutchouc,

--gum-lacs or bitumen. The substitution of other metals of wood, glass, earthenware,
--or gutta percha for lead in the construction of cisterns and pipes, is also referred to.

Of chemical means, he instances the addition to the water of powerfully protective

salts, such as the phosphate of soda, or the iodide of potassium in minute propor-

tion.

   The author believes that cases of lead poisoning, in a minor degree, are still con-
stantly occurring in all our large towns from the plumbeous impregnation of our
drinking waters ; and he impresses the necessity of inquiring at once into the con-

dition of the water supply whenever obscure colic or paralytic complaints exhibit

themselves, otherwise inexplicable, especially if it be found that several persons arc

simultaneously affected*.

On an hnproved Electric Lamp invented and manufactured by Mr. William
   Hart, Edinburgh. (^Communicated by Dr. Stevenson Macadam,

   F,R.S.E.)

   The relation which the several parts of this lamp hear to each other, will be better
understood by following the route which the electricity takes in its travels through
the lamp. The wire attached to one of the extremities of the battery is brought to
a binding-screw, which is in metallic connexion with the cylindrical base of the
arrangement and the lower charcoal rod. The latter is immoveable, and constitutes
one of the poles of the voltaic battery. The wire coming from the opposite end of

the battery is placed in a connecting screw (which is insulated from the cylindrical
base by the insertion of a ring of ivory), passes up the centre of a hollow stem (also
insulated from the cylindrical base by ivory), is led through a canal in the centre of

an arm placed at right angles to the stem, and is then wound round an electro-
magnet suspended in a vertical position from the arm. Thus far the wire is covered
with silk, and hence does not come into metallic connexion with the other parts of
the lamp ; but having completed its required course, it is soldered to the electro-
magnet, and thus becomes metallically connected with the upright stem and all its
appurtenances, including a file-like rod, grasping the upper charcoal rod, which is

moveable and forms the second electrode.

   When the battery is not in action, the roughened or file-like rod, with its attached

upper carbon pole, is not upheld by any device, but simply reclines on the lower

carbon rocl ; but whenever the voltaic current is allowed to circulate, the electro-
magnet is formed and its armature is drawn up; a ring connected with the armature
compresses the halves of a hollow wedge; the upper edges of the wedge fix into the
grooves in the file-like rod with its attached carbon, and in the general movement
upwards the latter is slightly raised from the lower carbon, and the light is instantly

produced.

  --It will thus be observed, that the ring attached to the armature performs two offices

when drawn up towards the electro-magnet: in the first place, rising from a narrower
jjart, where it loosely surrounds the hollow wedge, it tightly embraces, when half-
mast high, the wider part of the wedge, and compels it to set in tightly to the file-like
rod ; and in the second place, having firm hold of the wedge, it drags up that part
with the now adherent roughened rod and upper carbon, and holds these suspended
at the proper distance. The light continues to burn steadily till the charcoal points
by combustion and the transference of carbon have their proper distance from each
other increased to that point when the electricity ceases to flow; then the electro-
magnet loses its attracting power, the armature and the attached ring fall down ; the
halves of the wedge, separate from each other, loose their hold of the file-like rod, and
allow the latter to descend by the force of gravitation, till the upper charcoal pencil
touches the lower carbon rod, when instantly the electrical current is re-established,
the magnet is reformed, and the upper carbon is again drawn up. So momentarily
does this extinguishing and relighting of the lamp occur, that the interval of darkness
is hardlyobservable to the naked eye. In duration of time, as also in the convulsive
throb which the moveable parts of the apparatus then give, the phenomenon greatly
resembles the beat of the heart of an animal. The lamp may be accommodated to
any size of battery sufficient to show the light. By means of a series of screws in
connexion with the armature, and the supporting arm, the moveable and adjusting
part of the lamp may be lowered from the electro-magnet or raised towards it. If
the battery be small, then the lifting arrangement is screwed up near the magnet
whilst if the battery be large, and a corresponding amount of electricity at command,
the regulators are placed I'urthcr from the lifting power, and when the voltaic cur-
rent traverses the arrangement, the moveable carbon is drawn up a greater distance,
more space is presented between the carbon poles, and necessarily a longer and more

dazzling arc of flame is formed.

JVofe on the Production of a Frosted Smfuce on Articles made of Aluminium.

  By Stevenson Macadam, Ph.D., F.Ii.S.E., F.C.S., Lecturer on Che-

    mistry, Surgeons' Hall, Edinburyh.

   The attention of the author was directed to this subject, on the occasion of pre-
paring several class medals from the rare metal ahuninium. The metal was obtained
direct from Paris in small ingots. The die-stamper in this country fused the bars of
aluminium and recast the metal in a form of ingot mould, more suitable for the after
operations. The metal bars thus obtained were subjected to rolling, then annealed,
and the medals struck. Every care was taken to have the die perfectly clean and
highly polished, and yet the medals were always obtained with a tarnished appear-
ance on the surface, which rendered still more unacceptable the blue zinc hue which
the aluminium presents when most free from surface blemishes. An attempt was
made to get rid of the tarnished surface by friction or polishing, but this did not
sensibly remove the stains. It was then resolved to frost the medals in the same
way as silver articles are frosted, viz. b}' the employment of hydrochloric acid into
which the heated metal is dipped ; but the action of acids on aluminium was so slow,
that they failed to produce the requisite effect, and their employment was dispensed

with.

   The author then introduced the aluminium articles into a solution of caustic potash
raised to a temperature above blood-heat, which immediately attacked the metal,
                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                       57

hydrogen being disengaged, and vciy shortly the ahnninium assumed a fine wliite
frosted appearance. The solution of caustic potash, when concentrated, acts very
violently upon the aluminium ; and if the metal were not speedily rescued, it would
soon entirely disappear. Even a dilute potash solution at a blood-heat will slowly

produce the frosted appearance.

   The author suggests that the process now indicated may be found of service in the
arts. Aluminium has hitherto proved itself to be unacceptable on account of its
similarity in appearance to zinc, but now a frosted surface may be comnnuiicatcd to
articles made of aluminium, which rivals that of frosted silver, and which possesses

this great advantage over silver, that it is not liable to be acted upon by sulphuretted

hydrogen, such as silver is, but continues to retain its fine white frosted appearance.

        On the Comhustibility and other Properties of the Rarer Metals,

                    By J. A. Matthiessen, Ph.D., F.C.S.

The author gave a description of the very beautiful metals obtained from the alkalies

and alkaline earths, which was illustrated by the exhibition of a variety of these metals,

as attractive as unusual. The specimens of so4ium, lithium, potassium, calcium,

strontium, &c., were regarded with great interest, and their combustion in an intensely

brilliant white light elicited frequent expressions of admiration. Their extreme

lightness was dwelt on, lithium being lighter than any liquid, and possessing little

more than half the specific gravity of water. From magnesium the combustion re-

sulted  in  an  ash  hollow  throughout.

          Oil Chromatic Photographs. By John Mercer, F.P.S.

   The author exhibited a number of coloured photographs, some on paper and others
on calico, which had been prepared by the following process:--34 ozs. of sulphate of
iron are converted into peroxalate ; this is diluted to two gallons, and will impregnate
200 square yards of paper, the paper being floated on the solution till fully wet in
the usual way. It is then exposed, and afterwards steeped in some solution which
only acts on that part where the iron has been reduced from the per- to the prot-oxide.
Red prussiate of potash and sulphuric acid act well, making the image blue, and
leaving the ground white. Sulphocyanide of potassium and a salt of copper form
another bath ; the protoxide of the picture deoxidizes the copper, and the sulphocyanide
of the suboxide of copper is fixed in the paper or cambric. This may be converted

into the red copper prussiate. A vast number of colours may be obtained by re-

placing the iron or copper by other metals, such as lead, zinc, tin, mercury, silver,

gold, or manganese. With these bases may be used various dyes, as madder, co-

chineal, murexide, logwood, galls, or quercitron bark, besides the iodides, chromates,

prussiates, or oxides of the melals themselves and mixtures of these.

   The author showed how the peroxalate paper might be used as a fair actinometer,
by placing a slip between the leaves of a book, and pulling it out by steps every
stated number of seconds. It is then easily converted into a graduated scale.

On the Relation of the Atomic Weights of the Families of the Elements,

                       By John Mercer, F.R.S.

It is well known that where three or more elements foi-m a well-defined group or

family (such as lithium, sodium, and potassium), their atomic weights are found to

stand in some simple relation to one another. The present paper pointed out many

of these numerical relations, and those which arise when the equivalents of one group

are subtracted from the equivalents of another group. Thus, for example, the lithium

group may be supposed to be constructed in a similar manner to the group of organic

=radicals, hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, &c., as shown in the subjoined Table, where 6 1.

Thus also, for example, if the atomic weights of the nitrogen group be subtracted

from those of the fluorine group, the residue is in each case 5.

              On the Atom of Tin. By Dr. W. Odling, F.C.S.

   The author argued, from both original and recorded experiments, that the atomic
weight of tin was not 59, as usually accepted, but the double thereof, or 118; and,
consequentlj^, that stannous salts were not protosalts, but bisalts; and stannic salts
not bisalts, but quadrisalts. This view was supported by tlie following considerations
namely, that stannous oxide has the property of expelling carbonic acid from fused
alkaline carbonates ; that stannous oxide does not form any combination with carbonic
acid ; that stannous salts are completely decomposed by chalk and insoluble carbon-
ates, even at ordinary temperatures ; that stannous chloride is readily fusible and
volatile, and is decomposed to a considerable extent by water; that stan-ethyl, or

stannous ethyl, has not the properties of a prot-ethylide, but of a per-ethylide, as in-
stanced by the facility with which it combines with oxygen and chlorine, and replaces
the basic hydrogen of different acids; that the vapour-density of stannic chloride
requires the existence of four atoms of chlorine in its molecule ; and, lastly, that

stannic fluoride corresponds closely to silicic fluoride, the molecule of which, as shown
by its vapour-density, contains four atoms of fluorine.

On the Purple Dye obtainedfrom Coal- Tar. By W. H. Per kin, F.C.S.

   This dye, a specimen of which was exhibited, is a product of the oxidation of ani-
line by bichromate of potash. It is a bronze-coloured substance, dissolving in alcohol
with a beautiful purple colour. It is difficultly soluble iti water, but more soluble
in acidulated water. Like indigo, it is perfectly decolorized by the hydrated prot-
oxide of iron, the colour being i-estored again by exposure to the air. It dissolves in
concentrated sulphuric acid, forming a green solution, which, upon the addition of
water, precipitates the colour unchanged. It is not affected by digestion with an
alcoholic solution of potash. It decomposes slowly at 250° C. It is applicable for
dyeing and printing silk, cotton, or wool. Its colour is exceedingly intense, one
pound of the solid substance dyeing no less than 200 lbs. of cotton a moderately dark
lilac. The colours thus produced are very permanent, standing the action of light
and heat, acids and alkalies. Samples of silk dyed with it were exhibited.

On a new Methodfor the Quantitative Estimation of Nitric Acid.
                              By Dr. Pugh.

   The aiitliov found that the action of nitric acid upon protochloride of tin, in a solu-
tion strono'ly acidified with clilorhydric acid, produced perchloride of tin and am-

that the reaction was not completed, at the boiling-point, under ordinary pressure,
even when maintained at this point for several hours. The results obtained at ordi-
nary pressure with long-continued boiling, presented no constant value, and the

maximum degree of oxidation afforded did not amount to quite three-fourths of the

whole quantity required by the formula given above.
    But on heating the mixture in an oil-bath, in glass-stoppered bottles, or in herme-

tically sealed tubes, to 160° Centigrade, the reaction was completed in 10 minutes.

Upon this reaction he proposed to found two methods for the determination of nitric
acid, either one or both of which could be used with the same quantity taken for

--analysis.
   (a.) Firsl Method. This consists in ascertaining how much protochloride of tin is

--converted into perchloride during the reaction.
   (b.) Second Method. This takes advantage of the ammonia formed during the
reaction. It is separated by distillation with an excess of fixed alkali and the di-
stillate caught in a receiver, with a known quantity of acid, which is then treated
according to Peligot's method for estimating nitrogen.

   In the first iTiethod the amount of protochloride of tin converted into perchloride by
the nitric acid is ascertained by triturating equal quantities of the tin solution before
and after the reaction with the nitrate to be examined. This is done by ascertaining
how much of a solution of known strength of bichromate of potash will be converted
into the sesquioxide of chromium by a given quantity of the protochloride solution,

according to the formula

                   2(Cr03)-h3HCl-l-3'SnCl = Cr,03-f3H04-3SnCI,,

the point of complete chloridation being ascertained according to String's method by
the intensely blue colour produced, on the liberation of free iodine, from iodide of
potassium, in the presence of starch, by the first trace of chromic acid over that re-

quired to chloridate the tin.

              NOj corresponding to |- (KO-CCrO^),)
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and hence, without knowing the value of the strength of the protochloride solution, ex-
cept in terms of the bichromate used, we get the amount of nitric acid present. Thus

The second process is not quite so exact as the first, because of the want of delicacy

in the process for the determination of ammonia; yet it is true to two-tenths of a

millegram of the nitrogen present.
    In order to use the first process, no easily deoxidizable substance should be present.

The author had not yet learned the full extent of the influence of such substances, but
he hoped to be able to find means of eliminating all possible errors from this source.

       On Animal Ammonia, its Formation, Evolution, and Office.
                 By the Rev. J. B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S.

Alluding to the essay on 'The Cause of the Coagulation of the Blood,' by Dr.

Richardson, to which the Astley Cooper Prize had been adjudged, the author pointed

out how nearly Raspail had approached to the same conclusions as the essayist. In

his treatise on Organic Chemistry, he says, " the constant alkalescence of the blood,

newly drawn from the vessels, and the coagulation produced in it by a diluted acid,

do not leave room for a doubt that the menstruum of the albumen is an alkali.

This alkali is soda, but more especially ammonia, of which no notice has been taken by

the various authors, but the presence of whose salts in the blood may be distinctly

recognized by the microscope." " If this principle," he adds, " be admitted, the

spontaneous coagulation of the blood presents no inexplicable diflicuUy." llaspail's

additional remarks only led him further from the truth he so nearly approached, and

inconsistently he attributed coagulation to the evaporation of watery vapour only.

   Many years since the author demonstrated before the Microscopical Society of

London, the presence of ammonia in the breath and tissues of animals, but his con-

clusions were received with much hesitation. Now that its ofiice as a solvent of the

fibrine of the blood is generally admitted, he would proceed to inquire into its source.

An experiment, by which the presence of ammonia in the perspiration of man and

animals is shown, may be readily performed, but is not included in those given by

ADr. Richardson. glass vessel is moistened upon its inner surface with hydrochloric

acid, and its aperture held against the skin after exercise has been taken. The fluid

will yield evidence of hydrochlorate of ammonia, when submitted to microscopic

examination.

Dr. Richardson has shown that the transmission of the vapour of blood through

another portion of that fluid arrests coagulation. The same effect occurs when the

breath is passed into blood.

Repeated experiments have shown that the ammonia eliminated in the breath

varies greatly in different individuals at the same time, and in the same person at

different hours of tlie day, and under altered conditions of rest, exercise, or fatigue.
The small amount contained in the atmosphere inspired is quite inadequate to ac-
count for that excreted, and we must consequently regard it as produced within the
body. The albumen and fibrine of the blood suggest themselves as capable of sup-

plying the nitrogen and hydrogen requisite. If we may assume the blood to be the

source of animal ammonia, let us look at the exquisite balance of chemical forces in

its connexion with that fluid. Blood is feebly alkaline from fixed alkali or alkaline
salt; not sufficiently so to hold fibrine in solution by this agency, but to a degree which

ensures the volatile alkali being left free for this purpose, when formed in the closed
chambers of the circulation. This view harmonizes with the fact, that the formation
of ammonia is a continuous process; the portion which maintains fluidity at a given
moment does not remain to exercise this office for hours or days; but carrying the
fibrine to every part of the body to supply its waste, it is itself eliminated by the

excretory surfaces,  .^__^___

On the Practical Ajjplication of Aluminium. By R. Reynolds, F.C.S.

by Messrs. Coulson and Co., Sheffield. In this form, its lightness, as compared with

Athe metals ordinarily used for such purposes, was very striking.  perfect polish

had been attained, but its zinc-like tinge of colour made it differ from silver in

appearance. The handles of a knife and fork by the same manufacturers were also

exhibited. Tliey closely resembled gold in colour, and were composed of an alloy of

copper with 5 per cent, of aluminium. By varying the per-ceutage of the last-named

metal from 5 to 10, any shade of gold colour is attainable.

           On some Double Salts formed ivith Bichromate of Potash.

                              By W. K. Sullivan.

    In the description given in Gmelin's ' Handbuch,' of Fritzsche's process of pre-

paring chromic acid, it is recommended carefully to add a warm solution of bichromate

of potash to an excess of oil of vitriol, as any excess of the salt would crystallize out
without being decomposed, and thus contaminate the chromic acid. It appeared to

me improbable that bichromate of potash would separate under such circumstances;

and having had occasion recently to notice the salt which separates, I found that it
did not present the characters of bichromate, and that it contained sulphuric acid.

    If a nearly boiling concentrated solution of bichromate of potash be treated with
sufficient oil of vitriol to convert the whole of the potash into bisulphate, but not to
precipitate the chromic acid, and be then set aside, an abundant crystallization of

anhydrous bisulphate of potash will be formed. The crystals thus formed are often of
considerable size, and beautifully exhibit the peculiar reaction of the anhydrous bi-
sulphate with water, namely, of swelling up and becoming opake. The crystals are
always coloured yellow by the adhering solution, but sometimes they appear to
contain some chromate in combination ; for even after having been repeatedly dried
between folds of filtering paper, they yielded a mixture of bisulphate of potash in
acicular needles and orange-red rhombic needles, when dissolved in water and

recrystallized.

    When somewhat less oil of vitriol was employed than in the last case, a beautiful

 salt composed of orange-red rhombic plates separated, which were readily decomposed

by water, exhibiting the same phenomenon as the anhydrous bisulphate. When a

 quantity of the transparent crystals were placed upon a filter and washed with water,
they gradually became opake, swelled up and changed to a pale orange yellow mass.

When the washing was not carried too far, and the filter was placed upon a plate of

 dry plaster of Paris, so as to absorb the moisture, the substance still exhibited the

original form of the undecomposed salt, but the crystals were quite opake and
friable. This pseudomorphic residue, when dissolved in water and the solution set
aside to crystallize, yielded acicular crystals of bisulphate of potash and an orange-

red salt in rhombic needles.

   Tiiis remarkable mode of decomposition can only be accounted for by supposing the
salt to contain bisulphate of potash. The determination of the sulphuric and chromic
acids gave numbers, which upon this view lead to the very simple formula

                          KO, HO, 2SO3 + KO, 2Cr03.

   The strangeness of such a combination (for I am not aware that any similar one
has been observed) makes me hesitate even to suggest it as an explanation of the

phenomena observed, especially as I have only very partially examined the subject

as yet.

   There appears to be several other salts of the same class. I have obtained, for
example, compounds which, upon the supposition of their being double salts of bisul-
phate of potash, contained an amount of sulphuric acid and chromic acid respectively,

which would lead to the formulae

                                    KO, HO, 2S03-l-2(KO, CrOg)
                                    KO, HO, 2S03+3(KO, CrOg).

   The formation of these salts, and indeed the action generally of oil of vitriol upon
a solution of bichromate of potash, affords a beautiful example of the influence of mass

upon cliemical aflinity.

   When the first salt was dissolved in water and the solution evaporated and set

aside, a salt crystallized out which did not become opake in water, and which could

be recrystallized without change. Its analysis led to the formula

                                       KO, S03+3(KO, Cr03).

   By using a slight excess of bichromate of potash in preparing chromic acid by

Fritzsche's process, and dissolving the precipitated red acid in a small quantity of cold
water, Reinsch obtained a yellow salt as a residue, which crystallized in broad rhombic

needles united together in stellated masses. To this salt he assigned the formula
KO, S03-|-K02Cr03. This salt appears to me to have been a product of the action
of water upon one of the salts which are formed in concentrated solutions in which
bisiilphate of potash can be formed. I obtained this compound among the products

of decomposition of one of the salts which I have suggested to contain bisulphate of

potash.

   I have obtained several other combinations which I have not yet examined, among
which I may mention the following :

    1. I added a considerable quantity of oil of vitriol to the mother-liquor from which

the salt KO, HO, 2SO3+KO, 2Cr03 had on one occasion separated, and then evapo-

rated it briskly and set it aside. While hot it was of a deep brown colour, and
crusts of chromic acid formed on the side of the vessel ; as it cooled, it grew turbid,
and the colour gradually became paler and of a purer yellowish red, as if the whole
pf the free chromic acid had again entered into combination*. After a short time,
small crystalline scales made their appearance in the liquid, having the lustre and
very much the appearance of spangles of metallic gold. They floated upon the sur-
face of the liquid, and acting as nuclei, they shot out in fan-like masses, the borders
of which got covered with a delicate fringe of needles of chromic acid. They arranged
themselves on the bottom of the basin in warty masses about the size of a half-walnut.
They were of extreme delicacy, so that the moment the vessel was disturbed they got
detached and flouted in the liquid like scales of iodide of lead. They were rapidly
filtered through a funnel stopped with broken glass ; and as they continued to dissolve
during the filtration, they were put upon a plate of dry plaster of Paris. The dried
residue looked very much like chromic acid, except that it had a distinct orange

shade, and was foliated.

   2. When the mother-liquor of one of the supposed bisulphate salts was mixed with

another portion in which the chromic acid had been reduced to the state of Cr^Oj by
alcohol, and set aside, small crystals of chrome-alum separated, but mixed with another

   * This change may be observed in all cases where sulphuric acid is mixed with bichromate

salt in the form of brilliant bronze-coloured scales, strikingly resembling the bronze-
coloured mica of some granites. This salt contains sulphuric acid ; but whether all

the chrome exists as chromic acid, I have not yet ascertained; I have failed in

reproducing it.

3. I treated a boiling concentrated solution of bichromate of potash with glacial

phosphoric acid and set it aside until the following day ; a pale orange-red salt cry-

Astallized out in small nacreous scales.         portion of this salt, dissolved in water and

set aside to crystallize, yielded a beautiful salt consisting of well-developed rectangu-

lar prisms of remarkable brilliancy. One feature of the artion of phosphoi'ic acid
was, that the solution, no matter how much of the glacial acid was added, did not

deepen in colour : it rather indeed became paler, and at no time did there appear to

exist any uncombined chromic acid in solution.

On tJte Constitution of the Mineral Portion of Bones^ and the Analysis of
  Common Bone-ash, Animal Charcoal, ^c. By Professor Voelcker,

   Ph.D., F.C.S.

   Heintz of Berlin maintains the phosphate of lime to exist in a tribasic form, but

found in human and other bones an excess of lime, combined neither with PO^ nor
CO-. This he regards as fluoride of calcium, and consequently records as much as

3 "85 per cent, of that substance as existing in bones. This, however, is simply the

result of calculation from the excess of lime. The author had made many experi-
ments to determine fluoride of calcium in bones, but without success ; although when

he added 1 per cent, of that substance to pure phosphate of lime, it could be readily

determined.

   When a dilute acid solution of bone-ash is precipitated by ammonia, the author
has always found as much lime as is contained in the tribasic salt, and usually more,

as carbonate of lime will be found to fall down with the precipitate in spite of all
precaution; this is especiall}' the case when the precipitation has been accompanied

by heat. When conducted in the cold, and reprecipitated, the result agrees very closely

with tribasic phosphate. In proof of the discrepancies of the process of precipitation,

are the following experiments :

=The direct determination of phosphoric acid gave 33*34 tribasic phosphate 72"23

per cent. The author much regretted the discredit brought upon chemistry by the

great variations in commercial analyses of these substances, and alluded to a practice

adopted bj' some chemists of regarding tlie precipitate as 8CaO-|-3PO', and after-

wards re-calculating the phosphoric acid into the tribasic salt, by which their results

became much too high. He considered it imperative to discard the precipitation pro-

cess altogether, and to state the amount of phosphoric acid actually found, giving the

pcr-centage of tribasic salt equivalent to this.

The author recommends the following plan for the commercial analysis of bone-ash,

animal charcoal, &c., and has employed it for some time in his own laboratory.

Moisture and organic matter are determined as usual. About 20 grains are dissolved

in nitric acid, and the sohition evaporated on a water-bath to dryness, which effects

the conversion of any pyrophosphate into ordinary phosphate. The residue is taken

up by the smallest possible quantity of nitric acid, then diluted with water, the sand

removed and the solution filtered. This is precipitated by excess of oxalate of potash,

and before removing the resulting precipitate, the liberated oxalic acid is nearly neu-

tralized by potash, acetate of potash is added, and the whole boiled. By this means

the oxalate of lime held in solution by free acid is thrown down. Filter and wash the

precipitate, and concentrate the filtrate to a small bulk. Add a little tartaric acid to

keep in solution any iron or alumina, and precipitate the phosphoric acid by ammoniacal

sulphate of magnesia : after standing for twelve hours, filter, partially wash the preci-
                            --

pitate, redissolve and throw down a second time. This precaution is necessary, as the
first product is contaminated with oxalate of magnesia. The lime precipitate con-
tains generally a variable quantity of phosphates of iron and alumina. To estimate
these, dissolve it in hydrochloric acid, add ammonia, wash precipitate, redissolve from

the filter, and throw down a second time without heat. When washed and dried, as

burned, the weight is deducted from the first amount of which it is a part, and the re-
sult is pure carbonate of lime. The phosphate of iron and alumina being dissolved in

On Chloro-Arsenious Acid, and some of its Compounds.
        By William Wallace, Ph.D., F.C.S.

In the course of a former series of experiments on the chloride of arsenic*, I

observed that arsenious acid dissolved freely in the anhydrous chloride. Believing

that a definite combination was formed, I have recently investigated the subject more

fully, and have succeeded in preparing a new and highly interesting compound, to

Mywhich I have given the name of chloro-arsenious acid.  examination of the acid

and its compounds is still far from complete ; but I purpose in the mean time to sub-

mit a short abstract of my results to the members of the British Association.

 --1. Solution of Arsenious Acid in Chloride of Arsenic. When chloride of arsenic

is heated to gentle ebullition in a small tubulated retort, the beak of which is inclined

upwards, and powdered arsenious acid is gradually introduced, the solution of the lat-
ter appears to cease when the liquid contains equal equivalents of the two compounds.

The readiest method of preparing this solution in quantity is to introduce a few ounces

of arsenious acid into a flask, and pass hydrochloric acid gas through it until all the
arsenious acid disappears. The flask should be agitated occasionally. The action is

very violent, and is attended by the elimination of much heat. If the passage of the

hydrochloric acid gas is continued as long as absorption takes place, pure chloride of
arsenic is obtained. The nature of the reaction has been fully explained in the paper

--already referred to.
  2. Chloro-arsenious Acid. When the solution of arsenious acid in chloride of

arsenic is gradually distilled until it begins to froth up, there separates, on cooling, a

pasty, viscid, semi-fluid mass, from which the more liquid portion may be poured oft'.

Analysis gave as follows :

Arsenic                     .... 28-11  1=75             59-29
Chlorine
O.xygen                                 1=35-5           2806
                                                         1265
                                        2=16

                                        126-5 100-00

   The formula of this compound, therefore, is AsCF-|-2AsO^ or AsClO^, that is,
arsenious acid in which one equivalent of oxygen is replaced by chlorine.

   Anhydrous chloro-arsenious acid is a viscid fluid or a very soft solid, according to
the temperature to which it is exposed. It is transparent, but has a brown colour,
which does not appear to be owing to the presence of any impurity. It fumes slightly

in the air, jjarting with a small portion of its chlorine as hydrochloric acid, and

absorbing oxygen. When strongly heated, it boils up with considerable frothing, and
affords a distillate of pure chloride of arsenic. When brought up to about the tempe-

rature at which arsenious acid sublimes, it leaves a glassy, hard, transparent substance,
which was found to contain 10-94 per cent, of chlorine, agreeing with the formula

2AsO\ AsClO^
   The fluid poured off" from the chloro-arsenious acid was found, on analysis, to con-

tain an amount of chlorine which corresponds with the formula AsCP, AsO^. It is

therefore similar to the solution prepared by adding arsenious acid to heated chloride
of arsenic. I do not believe, however, that this liquid is a compound of these two

substances; if a definite combination at all, its constitution is probably 3 AsO* CI

AsCP.

   Chloro-arsenious acid is also formed wben chloride of arsenic is treated with a
quantity of water not quite sufficient to dissolve it. On adding small successive por-

tions of water to the chloride, the proportion of chlorine in the undissolved quantity

--gradually diminishes, until the last globules consist chiefly of the compound acid.
   3. Hydrated Cliloro-arsenious Acid. Chloride of arsenic is dissolved in the smallest

possible quantity of water (about 16 equivalents), and the solution set aside in a closed

flask. In two or three days minute nucleated crystals begin to form; and these gra-

Adually increase until about one half of the liquid is occupied by them,  second crop

of crystals may be obtained by placing a fragment of rock-salt in the mother-liquor :
these take a long time to form, and are much larger and better defined than those
which result from the first operation. The crystals may be well pressed with a pla-

tinum spatula, and then dried by pressure between numerous folds of blotting-paper.

A portion was analysed which had been completely dried by powerful pressure, and

the following results were obtained :  51-80        1=75     51-90
                                       24-97                 21-57

                                                    2=16

                                                    144-5    100-00

   The crystallized acid contains, therefore, two equivalents of water, and is repre-
sented by the formula 2H0, AsClO-. It becomes anhydrous over oil of vitriol, but
at the same time loses 2 or 3 per cent, of chlorine. The crystals are exceedingly
minute, and form in mammillated masses resembling the mineral Prehnite. The
slowly-formed crystals are acicular, and collect in stellate groups, presenting, while
in the liquid, a very beautiful appearance. The smaller crystals have a dazzling white

colour, and emit a little hydrochloric acid on exposure to the air.

    Chloro-arsenious acid combines with chlorides, as arsenious acid does with oxides.

It appears to be blbaslc, the two equivalents of water being capable of being replaced

by two equivalents of an alkaline chloride. The ammonia-salt is the only one which
I have as yet succeeded in obtaining in a distinctly crystalline form, and of definite
composition. Potash and lime compounds have been obtained as white powders which
contain much less than two equivalents of alkaline chloride ; so that these compounds
have probably only one equivalent of alkaline chloride, and one equivalent of basic

water.

   Two interesting reactions of the solution of tercliloride of arsenic in water may

here be mentioned: oil of vitriol itumediately throws down the anhydrous compound,
while chloride of calcium causes the separation of the cliloride mixed with a small
proportion of chloro-arsenious acid. The same reactions occur with a saturated solu-

tion of arsenious acid in concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid : indeed, an ounce or

two of chloride of arsenic may readily be prepared by adding an equal bulk of strong

oil of vitriol to such a solution. It is not so pure, however, as that obtained from

the aqueous solution of chloride of arsenic, and must be rectified if required in a state

of purity.

   4. Chloro-arsenHe of Ammonia.-- The aqueous solution of chloride of arsenic is

mixed with strong liquid hydrochloric acid in sufficient quantity to prevent the form-

ation of chloro-arsenious acid, and a small lump of chloride of ammonium is intro-

duced. At first, small, hard, reddish-coloured, cubical crystals, consisting of almost
pure chloride of ammonium, make their appearance ; but after some days, long fibrous
needles of snow-white colour and pearly lustre begin to form, and gradually fill up
the liquid. These consist of the salt under consideration. They are well-drained,
and dried by pressure between folds of blotting-paper. The following results were

obtained with the salt dried over oil of vitriol :
       ....Arsenic
                                       32-23        1= 75    32-12
                                                    2= 36    15-42
       ....Ammonium . . . 15-23                              45-61

       ....Oxygen                                              6-85
                                       ..           2= 16

                                                    233-5 100-00

   The formula of tlie dry salt is therefore 2NIi'Cl, AsClO-. The loss of water by
exposure over oil of vitriol amounted to 4-27 per cent. ; one equivalent of water gives
3-71 per cent. During the desiccation, a little chlorine is evolved and replaced by

oxygen.

   I am still engaged in prosecuting the investigation of the compounds of ehloro-

arsenious acid with the metallic chlorides, and in endeavouring to form corresponding
acids containing iodine and bromine.

               Oh the Source of Ammonia in Volcanic Emanation,

                          By R. Warington, F.C.S.

   At the Meeting of the British Association at Liverpool, 1854, the author demon-
strated the existence, in the lavas of Vulcano, of nitride of boron, which by the action
of watery vapour is converted into boracic acid and ammonia. Adopting an analo-
gous reasoning, he considered that, in volcanic districts where hydrated silicic acid
and ammonia were the ordinary products, a similar compound of silicon and nitrogen

should be met with. On examining the Pelagonites from the Heela district, the author

finds that they always contain nitrogen in combination, as he believes, with silicon as

a nitride of silicon, and that the source of ammonia in volcanic phenomena may be

principally attributed to the action of aqueous vapour, at high tempei-atures, on this

compoimd.

On an Instrument for maintaining a Water-Bath at constaiit Temperatures.

                       By John Waterhouse, F.R.S.

   The author exhibited to the Chemical Section an instrument which he called a
"Thermostadt," the object of which he explained to be, to afford the means of keep-

ing a water-bath at a uniform and unvarying temperature for an indefinite period. In

Athe accompanying sketch, B is a glass tube bent upon itself,              |-.

and when filled with spirit or other expansible fluid, forming a

thermometer of large dimensions : the two ends of this tube are

cemented into the brass cap and plate C, the end A being her-

Dmetically closed,B
          and     open                      is a stuffing-box (into which
                                         ;

the open end of the tube is cemented), through which the tube E,

open at both ends, passes, and which may be fixed in any required

position by the tightening screw collar F ; to the upper end of

this tube is attached a flexible tube, which may be connected with

Gan ordinary gas-pipe ; is a small tube screwed into the side of

the stuffing-box D, and communicating with the tube B or stem

of the thermometer, and serves as an attachment for another flex-

ible pipe which connects the apparatus with the burners which

Aare placed under the water-bath.           small quantity of mercury,

M, is introduced to separate the spirit in A from the open stem

--of the thermometer B. The operation of the instrument is as

follows : the whole being immersed to the plate C in the water-

bath, the gas passes through E into the tube B, and thence

Gthrough  to the burners ; as the temperature rises, the spirit

expands, and causes the mercury to rise in B until it finally

closes the terminal aperture of the tube E, when the gas ceases

to flow; to prevent, however, the total extinction of the flame,

which would now take place, a small hole, N, is pierced with a
needle through the side of the tube E at about an inch from the

end, which allows a sufficiency of gas to pass to support a speck

of flame not larger than a large pin's head. In operation the

flame soon acquires its appropriate dimensions to keep the bath

at a perfectly steady temperature, the exact amount of which is determined by sliding

the tube E in its collar, and thus giving the mercury a greater or less range.

   At first a difficulty presented itself in procuring a burner of sufficiently small aper-

ture for the jet, which would not be liable to be stopped up by the oily deposit from

common coal-gas ; this, however, was completely removed by making burners of ordi-
nary pipeclay, piercing them with a fine needle, drying, and then making them red-
hot in a common fire.

   The instrument in this state had been in constant use for seven or eight years,
during which it had been chiefly employed to regulate a small apparatus for carrying
on a series of experiments on incubation, and its steadiness of action had proved to be
all that could be desii-ed. The author mentioned to the Section as one proof of its
utility in such investigations, that it had enabled him to prove clearly the evolution
of vital heat in the process of hatching eggs, which are shown to acquire a tempera-
ture for some days before the completion of their incubation, several degrees above
the atmosphere in which they are placed ; a fact, which he believed had not been veri-
fied by actual experiment, thougli it would naturally be anticipated. The author
stated that the contrivance was the joint production of himself and Mr. S, Smith of

 Halifax.

Address by William Hopkins, M.A., F.R.S., President of the Section.

--The President, in opening the Section, proceeded to observe : the existence of

mammalian life in its earlier stages on the surface of our planet, the conditions of its

existence, and the period of its introduction, have always furnished questions of the

highest philosophical as well aspalseontological interest. You will be aware that some

geologists regard each new discovery of mammalian remains, in formations preceding

the older tertiaries, as a fresh indication of the probable existence of mammalia in

those earlier periods in which no positive proof of their existence has yet been obtained
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

while others regard such discoveries only as leading us to an ultimate limit, which will

hereafter define a period of the introduction of mammalia on the surface of the earth,

long posterior to that of the first introduction of animal life. Be this as it may, every

new discovery of the former existence of this highest class of animals must be a matter
of great geological interest. An important discovery of this kind has recently been

made, principally by the persevering exertions of Mr. Beckles, who has detected in
the Purbeck beds a considerable number of the remains of small mammals. The

whole of them are, I believe, in the hands of our President, Mr. Owen, for the deter-

mination  of their  generic  and  specific  characters                                                but Dr. Falconer seems already  to
                                                                                                   ;

have recognized among them seven or eight distinct genera, some of them marsupial,

and others probably placental, of the insectivorous order. I may also notice, as a

matter of great palceontological interest, the recent discovery of a new ossiferous cave,

near Brixham, in Devonshire, of which some account is to be brought before us during
this meeting. The past year has been fruitful in palieontological researches, but it is

not my purpose to notice them in detail.

    I proceed to one or two points of interest in the physical department of our science.

The internal structure of rock masses, with reference to joints, planes of cleavage, and

crystallization, is a subject of great interest to those who would study the operation

of physical causes in producing all the modifications of state through which the matter

now forming the outer crust of the globe must have passed in the lapse of geological

Atime,    considerable number of observations have been made by different geologists

respecting the positions of the planes of joints and of cleavage, but I confess myself
little satisfied with any laws of the phenomena unless deduced from observations of
far greater accuracy of detail than that by which these observations have generally
been characterized, I allude more particularly to this subject, because some progress
has, I think, been made in the mechanical explanation of a part of these phenomena,

those which relate to the laminated cleavage structure. Direct experiments have
been made by Mr. Sorby and Dr. Tyndall, which leave no doubt of the possibility of
producing this structure by direct pressure alone ; and in certain simple cases, in
which the divisional planes form a system of parallel lamina, this mechanical cause

may be sufficient to account for the phenomena. But in many other cases in which
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                  73

there appear to be several systems of these planes cf structure, the positions of which

would seem to bear determinate relations to each other, it would appear extremely

difficult to account for the phenomena by the simple operation of pressure alone. It

is likely, I conceive, that more complicated causes have been at work, though press-

ure may have exercised an important iniluence. Again, it has been suggested that

what has been termed the force of shrinkage, or that internal tension which may be

produced in extended masses by their contraction from the loss of heat or moisture,

might be sufficient to account for the formation of joints, the positions of which, you

will recollect, approximate more or less to verticality. But there is one curious feature

in these phenomena, which appears to me inexplicable on this theory. It is well
known that in conglomerate formations in which large boulders are imbedded, the

joints pass completely through the boulders without any apparent interruption.

According to this theory, these boulders must have been pulled in two by the force

of shrinkage. It is in this that the difficulty I allude to consists; for it would appear,

I think, extremely difficult to conceive how the general matrix of such a conglo-
merate, whatever may be the force with which it contracts, should obtain a sufficiently

powerful grasp on the two opposite halves of a smooth and rounded boulder, a few

inches in diameter, to pull them asunder. I suspect in all these phenomena the

working of some agencies more refined than those of simple compression and extension.

The subject of the motion of glaciers is one of interest to geologists; for unless we

understand the causes of such motion, it will be impossible for us to assign to former

glaciers their proper degree of efficiency in the transport of erratic blocks, and to di-

stinguish between the effects of glacial and of floating ice, and those of powerfuljcur-

rents. An important step has recently been made in this subject by the application

of a discovery made by Mr. Faraday a few years ago, that if one lump of ice be laid

upon another, the contiguous surfaces being sufficiently smooth to ensure perfect con-

tact, the two pieces in a short time will become firmly frozen together into one con-

tinuous transparent mass, although the temperature of the atmosphere in which they

are placed be many degrees above the freezing temperature. Dr. Tyndall has the

merit of applying this fact to the explanation of certain glacial phenomena. There

--are two recognized ways in which the motion of a glacier takes place one by the

sliding of the whole glacial mass over the bed of the valley in which it exists, and the

other by the whole mass changing its form in consequence of the pressures and ten-

sions to which it is subjected. The former mode of progression is that recognized by

the sliding theory; the second is that recognized by what has been termed the viscous

theory of Prof. Forbes. The viscous theory appeared to be generally recognized.
Still, to many persons it seemed difficult to reconcile the property of viscosity with

the fragility and apparent inflexibility and inextensibility of ice itself On the other

hand, if this property of viscosity, or something of the kind, were denied, how could

we account for the fact of the difterent fragments into which a glacier is frequently

broken, becoming again united into one continuous mass ? Dr. Tyndall has, I con-

ceive, solved the difficulty. Glacial ice, unhke a viscous mass, will bear very little

extension. It breaks and cracks suddenly; but the separate pieces, when subsequently

squeezed together, again become by regelation (as it is termed) one continuous mass.

After some general remarks on the cause of the laminar structure of glaciers,

he remarked that there was no doubt Dr. Tyndall was right in supposing the lamiuEe

of blue and white ice to be perpendicular to the directions of maximum pressure.
He reminded the Section, that he had himself shown this fourteen years ago, by a

rigorous mathematical investigation of the internal pressures and tensions of the

glacial mass, resulting from the more rapid motion in its central than in its lateral

portions ; and the results of this investigation were entirely sanctioned by the experi-

mental elucidations which Dr. Tyndall had given of the nature of these internal press-

ures. The physical explanation of the furmation of the veins could scarcely yet be

regarded as complete                                                                                                   but the actual perpendicularity of the  laminae of ice to the
                                                                                                                    ;

directions of maximum pressure within a glacier, and the probable perpendicularity

to those directions of the Irinunse in rock masses of laminated structure, would seem

to establish some relation between these structures in rocks and glacial ice, giving an

interest to this peculiar structure in the latter case, which it might not otherwise ap-

pear to possess for one who should regard it merely as a geologist.
   He concluded his remarks by referring to the papers to be read before the Section,
--74 REPORT 1858,

                                                                     On the Fossil Fishes and Yellow Sandstone.

    Referrinn- to his paper in the Report of the British Association of 1850, the autlior

remarked that much discussion had since occurred as to the true i)osiUo7i and forma-
tion of the Y cUow Sandstone of Dura Den, as well asof other localities. It was termed

the Yelloiv Sandstone, not simply because of the colour generally, but because of its

striking contrast with the other members of the Old Red Sandstone series*. In Ire-
land it seems to be regarded by Sir Richard Griffith, in his valuable communication

to the Section last year at Dublin, as holding a doubtful position, whether relatively

to the Old Red or to the Carboniferous system. Mr. Jukes declared, on the same
occasion, his conviction that " the whole fish-beds of Scotland, and the similar rocks

in Glamorganshire and South Wales, might belong to the Carboniferous system."
This confusion arose, the author was persuaded, from the confusion in the rocks
themselves in these localities, where, through means of the intrusive traps, they are
.nil upheaved and disturbed in their positions and relations to each other. But in

Dura Den the whole series are in the closest juxtaposition, and to be read off with
the ease of letter-press from sectional descriptions. He had further to add, upon the

question of age and position, that no Plerichthys nor Pamphractus had been found in
any of the rocks immediately above the yellow deposit of Dura Den, and he chal-
lenged the detection of one of either genus from any of the strata yielding Cephalaspis

or the grey sandstone beds with Pterygotus beneath, in Forfarshire, Perthshire, or
Caithness. Diplopteri were likewise abundant in this deposit. Sir Roderick Murchison

and Lord Kinnaird had accompanied him, a few days ago, to Dura Den, and he was now
fortified in his conclusion by the high authority of Sir Roderick, who at this Sectional

Meeting has declared " that there could be no doubt whatever that the yellow sand-
stones of Fifeshire pertain truly to the Old Red group, are entirely subjacent to the

lowest carboniferous sandstones, and are of the same age as the upper yellow sand-

stones of Elgin."                                                    drawings  on  the   wall          ,  .      ,      ,           ,.    ,               ,    o

Passing from this point, now, he thought, completely established, the author of the

paper proceeded to a description of the fossils so abundant in the deposit, amounting

to four o-enera and seven or eight distinct species of fishes and Crustacea. The beau-

tiful drawing of the large specimen before them was that of a Ilolopiychlus nohilis-

simus, excavated last week from its stony bed of ages, and adding a new member to

the Dura Den family of the genus, and thus placing it higher in the series than the

rocks of Glashbennie, or those of Cromartie and other localities in the north. He

held in his hand a specimen of the two bones of the head termed the glosso-hyal

plates that supported the lower jaw, and which resembled very much the plates in

the existing Sudis g'tgas of the American rivers. The huge Megalichthys of our

Scottish coal-fields had three glosso-liyal supporters, as if Nature in her arrangements

had made size a condition of organic structure. Upon the whole, he concluded, we

have in Dura Den a classic field for geologists of the deepest interest ; much has

been obtained, much remains to be detected in future researches. For the general

  J3y T. W. Atkinson, F.G.S.

The author said he did not intend to furnish a strictly geological account, describing

each stratum and mass of lava scientifically, his desire being only to point out and

describe volcanic regions passed through in his travels, commencing with that round

the Baikal in Oriental Siberia, and continuing to the Syan-shan ; extending over a
country lying between 80° and 110° east longitude, and from 41° to 55° north lati-

tude, and embracing a great variety of steppe and mountain, including a part of the

desert of Gobi.

The Baikal had by some persons been considered a vast crater, of which wonderful

stories were told by those who inhabit its shoies. It was said to be nearly COO miles

in length, varying from 30 to 40 miles in width. The northern shores of the Baikal

were rocky, and rose from 500 to 600 feet above the water, and, in a few places,

there were steppes or planes down to the water's edge. The island of Olchon

stretches along the northern shore                                                                                                                                                        it is about 60 miles in length, and from  12 to 15
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

miles in breadth. There was no appearance of volcanoes ever having been in action

either on the northern shore or on the island. On the southern shore, near Tour-

kniskaia and Bargouzin, volcanic action had most undoubtedly taken place.

   He next described the Kosso-gol, a lake 75 miles in length and 22 in breadth,

bounded on the north and west by snow-capped mountains ; on the lower slopes

were sevei-al volcanic domes from which lava had issued. Nearly in the middle of

the lake there was a conical-shaped island, probably 300 yards in diameter, and from

250 to 300 feet high. This he also believed to be volcanic.

   In the valley of the Oka, which was 120 miles to the westward, he came upon a
bed of lava more than a mile in width, extending nearly across the valley. The lava

had a metallic appearance, and was very hard. As he proceeded along the valley,

the lava increased in thickness ; in some places it rose up like a wall 40 feet high, and

in others it was heaped into enormous masses, and with great chasms crossed the bed,

as if formed by the mass in cooling. He then detailed his exertions to discover the

source of this stream of lava, during whicii he found that there had been two other

eruptions                                            the first had added to the old another stratum of lava 24 feet thick ;                                                                                                         the
                                                  ;

second a bed of 35 feet thick and a mile in breadth. The description of what hap-

pened to the expedition in search of the source of the lava was exceedingly interesting.

After a five days' journey the crater was reached; its length was 2 miles, and three-

quarters of a mile in width. It was after many long and weary rides, extending over

more than 500 miles, into Chinese Tartai-y, that he reached a singular dome-shaped

hill, near which he discovered abed of lava. On examining the spot, he was assured that

the substance had gushed from several places on the side of the mount, and had run a

short distance down the ravine. He determined to ascend the dome and examine the

summit. The whole mass was of a dark purple-grey colour, with the appearance of

having been forced up in a soft or fluid state into the shape of an enormous air-bubble.

It was split and fractured in every direction, but not in regular strata. That this was
the commencement of a volcano was quite certain, but the molten matter must have

found an outlet elsewhere. There was not a blade of grass or moss growing on the

dome, to the summit of which he and a Cossack scrambled with great toil and diflR-
culty. The distance from this place to Pe-shan, a volcano still in action, is about

450 miles.                                                                                                                                                                                ^__^

fern, named by Prof. Edward Forbes Cyclopterh Hibernica*, and obtained in such
great profusion from the Upper Devonian or base of the Carboniferous system at Kil-

torkan Hill, County Kilkenny, as having received additional interest from the discovery
of several specimens exhibiting it in various stages of fructification, and illustrating
other parts of its structure, forming part of a large collection recently made by the

Geological Survey from that locality.

   A diagram illustrating these particulars was exhibited and explained, including,

first, what was considered to be the base of the stem or rhizoma, having a rounded
expansion, apparently separating into scales, wliich continued upwards, fragments of
leaflets being attached to the stem at different intervals. The venation of a leaflet,
from one of the principal pinnules, presented longitudinally arranged stria; which

were occasionally forked.

   One of the fertile pinnules of a specimen showed the spores were aggregated intp

clusters or sori, and that the indusium or protecting cover had been but little broken

Aup. fertile pinnule from another specimen, however, appeared to be in a more

advanced stage, losing in a great measure the aggregated character of the sori, and
showing the protecting cases (which were granulated) to be much disturbed.

    Other specimens in the collection were alluded to ; one of which, with a length

of 16 inches, had twelve pinnules on each side of the rachis in full fructification,
without any appearance of leaflets, the spore-cases being scattered in all directions
another, of the same length, had about twenty pinmdes on each side, the lower ones
being in full fructification, which decreased gradually towards the upper portion of

the frond, the leaflets taking its place.
    Mr. Baily, having visited the locality, found the ferns to be most numerously distri-

buted through the beds which were composed of a fine-grained compact greenish
yellow sandstone, readily splitting into thin layers, some specimens presenting an
appearance of irregular venation and distortion as if from softening or maceration in
water: associated with them were many other plants and specimens of a large fresh-
water bivalve, Anodonta Jukesii (Forbes), having both valves united. About 3 feet
from the surface, in a much coarser and more irregular sandstone not splitting into
laminte, numerous fish remains were collected, believed to be the osseous plates of
Coccosteus (like C. dec'ipiens), and with them a single tooth of a Sauroid fish, probably
Dendrodus, being the second specimen of that kind obtained from this locality.

   The beds were found to dip at a very slight angle, about four or five degrees
to the S.W., having angular joints, in the neighbourhood of which they were much

broken up.

   The section exposed was stated to be as follows :

  ANo. 1. superficial deposit from 18 inches to 2 feet, with broken fragments con-

taining the same plants as in the beds beneath.
    No. 2. Fine-grained greenish shale with Cycloptcris and other plants, 1 foot.

1 foot.

layers, the lower beds being coarse, and the Cyclopteris large but not well-preserved.

The peculiar Coal-measure Crustacea, described by Mr. Baily, were first discovered

by Mr. George Henry Kinahan of the Geological Survey of Ireland, at the Bilboa

Colliery, Queen's Co., in debris obtained from the three-foot bed of shale imme-

diately over the coal, associated with a few plants and numerous small bivalve shells

(Myacites)  allied  to  Unio, together with  others of  the  Mytiloid  form  (Myaiina)                                                 the

Dublin, on one of the specimens first discovered, which he proposed should, as well
as the allied and probably contemporaneous forms found in ironstone nodules from
the Penney stone of the lower coal-measures, Coalbrook Dale, hitherto included in
the genus Limulus, be removed from the recent genus, as presenting characters more
closely allied to Trilobites, and to which new genus the name of Steropis was given.
Since then, however, more perfect specimens and another species had been obtained
by himself and Mr. Kinahan, which had still further confirmed his views respecting

the necessity for a rearrangement of the genus; and as one of the most common
species was origin ally figured by Kiinig in his ' Icones Sectiles' in 182.5, by the name
of Belliniirus hellulus, he considered it but just to restore that generic name in pre-
ference to adding a new one. These Coal-measure Crustacea appearing to be the
commencement of the Limuloid type, it was thought advisable to consider them as a
subgenus of Limulus under the name of Bellinurus.

   The nomenclature would therefore be the following :

                               Order ENTOMOSTRACA.

                                   Legion Pcecilopoda. Order Xiphosura.

   Descriptions of these two new species were given by Mr. Baily ; Bellinurus Regina,
which was of small size, being remarkable for having had the cephalic shield and

thoracic rings extended into long spines ; these diminished in regular gradation
towards the tail, which was small and bore a spine of great size and length, being
three times that of the animal.

    Length 1 inch and ^\h. Breadth J inch and ^ths. Length of tail-spine ^ths

of an inch.
    The second species, Bellinurus arcuatus, was said to be allied to B. trilohitoides,

but differed in its general form and the greater spreading out of the spines at the
posterior angles of the cephalic shield ; also in the development of two additional
spines from the ridge of the glabella extending over the body.

    Several specimens of this species were obtained ; one from a concretion in the shale
exhibited the form of the body, which was broadly ovate and acuminated posteriorly,
having a moderately developed tail-spine ; it showed distinctly the division of each
 thoracic ring into segments, having grooved lateral angles, as in the Trilobites.

    Length 1 inch. Breadth ^ths of an inch. Length of tail-spine about ^ an inch.
    Mr. Baily then alluded to the great paloeontological interest attached to the dis-
covery in Ireland of new forms of Coal-measure Crustacea so similar in character to
those found at Coalbrook Dale, Shropshire, by extending their distribution to corre-

sponding strata in that country, and indicating similar conditions to have been preva-
 lent over a wide area.

    On a comparison of these Coal-measure Crustacea with the more recent and living

forms, the wide gap in point of time corresponds with the great difference observable

in their structure, which exhibits a closer alliance with the Trilobites. On the con-

trary, there is a striking resemblance between the Upper Jurassic remains, which are
those of true Limuli and the living forms.
--78 REPORT 1858.

      On the Yorkshire Flagstones and their Fossils. By W. Baines.

    In illustration of tlic origin of this rock, the author relates the following observa-

tions. On a bleak moor side, in the shelving formation of a fine sandstone, was a
hollow dammed across for the accumulation of rain-water for scouring purposes. In
a few years it was filled up by a gradual deposit of sand. When dug out, there were

presented finely laminated strata. In noticing other depositions, the author found
that each layer was the deposit of one shower ; and in proportion to the quantity or
time of each succeeding rain, did the thickness of the deposit depend: each layer is

the effect of one flood, a time intervening when the sand was all accumulated at the
bottom, and the water had smoothed its surface by a very gentle action; so that the
smoothed bed would not allow of the next flood's deposit to mix.

   The laminae of the rock may be as thin as paper, or 1 inch thick for roofing-slate,

or 2 or 3 inches thick, which is the Yorkshire flag, or an uninterrupted deposition of
ages, when it becomes the cutting stone or ashlar, a number of square yards in one
mass without any cleavage. This Yorkshire flag then is but the pond deposit above
noticed on a larger scale, and the deposit of some ancient estuary wliose waters
washed the finer particles of the carboniferous sandstone from tlie Halifax and 'l"od-
morden districts ; but the deposition must have taken place, if not in deep water, cer-
tainly in still water ; for the smallest, yea, the faintest breeze of wind, caused the
ripple-marks, as thousands of the freestone slabs show, in the strata overlying the flag
formation, and the uppermost strata must have been formed in shallow water, and at
times completely dry, as there are hundreds of acres which bear impressions of rain
or hail drops having impinged upon the strata in process of formation. There are
great quantities of the tracks and depositions of annelidcs, or, as they are locally
termed, the earthworm. It is a formation extremely barren of animal remains.

   The Flora in the Yorkshire flag is not so numerous as in the ragged or crooked
stone above and below, simply from its being a quieter deposit than the other strata.
The most cojnmon fossil found in this formation and its kindred shale is the Calamite,
Bome shales between the different strata being literally composed of its impressions.
The next most common plant is the Stigmaria in profuse abundance, but very rarely

the trunk or Sigillaria. It is quite evident that the tuberous appendages denote it to

be a mud plant or roots. Some of the most magnificent and perfect specimens of the

Lepidodendron are found in this strata. There are also Pecopleris nervosa and Neu-
ropteris, &c. ; as also a few fossil fruits, similar to Trigonocarpum ovatum.

    Only two seams of coal, namely, Halifax soft and hard beds, lie under this stratum,
and above the great millstone grit base ; while thirty-three beds or bands of coal, with
hundreds of varying strata, overlie this deposit within twenty miles eastward to Old
Normanton, forming a series over 700 yards deep.

    Oti the Atlas and Axis of the Plesiosaurus. By L. Barrett, F.G.S.

   In a young specimen of Plesiosaurus presented to the Geological Museum of the
University of Cambridge by Thomas Hawkins, Esq., the atlas and axis have not
coalesced, and are detaclied from the remainder of the cervical series. The axis ia

nearly entire ; but the atlas has lost part of its posterior articular snrface, and the
whole of the second subvertebral wedge-bone. The interesting unanchylosed con-
dition of the four bones composing the atlantal cup is a sufficient excuse for occupying
a small portion of the time of the Section with a comparison of these bones with

those described by Prof. Owen in the 'Annals of Natural History ' for 18^7, and the
corresponding parts of the skeleton of the new species of Plesiosaurus described by
Prof. Huxley in the last number of the Geological Journal.

   We will first consider the structure of this specimen. The four bones composing

the atlantal cup have been slightly displaced ; and its shape is a little altered. The
base of the neural canal is formed anteriorly partly by its centrum and partly by the
expanded bases of the neurapophyses [losteriorly the centrum is much larger, and

                                                                                                                                                                            ;

forms the entire base of the canal. The upper thirds of the neurapophyses are
much expanded and bent backwards ; their inner angles have not coalesced, and there
is no trace of a neural spine. The anterior surfaces of the lower part of the neur-
apophyses are concave, and form the antero-lateral segments of the articular cup for

bone posteriorly they thin away, exposing the postcro-latcral edges of the centnun.
                            ;
    That part of the centrum which forms the middle of the upper half of the atlantal

cup is hexagonal, and it has a small pit in its centre                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   posteriorly  its  articular face is

three times as great (nearly as large as the articular surface of the body of the axis),

and has a circular depression in the middle. The wedge-bone forms the lower half

of the articular cup, and has been produced behind into two long processes, the bases

of which only remain.

The neural spine of the axis is long, and much thicker than that of any of the

succeeding cervical vertebrce ; the apex is broken off in this specimen. The neur-

apophyscs are separated from the centi-um by a distinct suture; and an oblique ridge

edge of the axis is bevelled-ofF, forming an articular surface for the second wedge-

bone                       and  the  basal  portions                                                                       of two  cervical ribs  remain                                                                                                                                 attached          to  the  anterior

lower part of the centrum : they must have partly articulated with the second wedge-

bone.

The axis of Plesiosaurus Elheridf/ii, lately examined by Prof. Huxley, agrees en-

tirely with that of this species ; but there are some important modifications in the

structui'e of the atlas.

 --Prof. Huxley describes the atlantal cup in this species as being divided by a tri-

radiate mark into three portions one inferior and two lateral and superior. The

inferior piece corresponds with the lower half of the atlantal cup, or the anterior sub-

vertebral wedge-bone ; and the two supero-lateral pieces, with the neurapophyses in

the specimen first described ; but their bases are much more developed.

There is a small circular bone in the centre, which Prof. Huxley considers to belong

to the OS odontoideum                                                                                                      it is the anterior articular face of that bone, and corresponds
                                                                                                                        ;

--to the hexagonal bone in the middle of the upper half of the atlantal cup in the

former species, the difference in position being caused in this species by the great

development of the supero-lateral pieces or bases of the neurapophyses.

The postero-lateral edges of this bone are greatly developed, forming a rounded

lidge on both sides of the posterior part of the atlas : the extraoi-dinary development

of this part of the bone is the most remarkable feature in the atlas and axis of this

species.

We Wenow come to the species first described by Prof. Owen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                have two speci-

mens, in the Woodvvardian Museum, of this species, both from the Kimmeridge Clay

of Haddenham, near Ely ; the larger of the two was figured by Prof. Owen in the

'Annals of Natural History,' vol. xx.

   The neural arches in both specimens are broken away ; and the bodies of the two
vertebrae have so coalesced, that the original line of separation is scarcely visible.
The neurapophyses and cervical ribs of the axis have become anchylosed to the bodies
of that vertebra. The posterior half of the bottom of the neural canal in the atlas is
formed by the true centrum of that vertebra ; but in the anterior half the bases of the
neurapophyses have spread over the centrum, and have united at the medial line.

On the upper part of the atlantal cup, a groove indicates the position of the original

suture between the bases of the neurapophyses and the lower part of the atlantal cup.
In the larger specimen there is a trace of the suture which separated the anterior
subvertebral wedge-bone from the upper part of the atlas, but which is absent in the
smaller specimen.

In the atlas of the three species of Plesiosaurus we have now considered, the

anterior articular face of the atlas is made up of four bones: of these, the os odon-

toideum is the most variable in size. Prof. Owen correctly assigned to it a large share

in the formation of the atlantal cup in the Kimmeridge Clay species. It forms about

a third of the upper half of the cup in the young unanchylosed specimen, and in P.

Etheridgii is extremely small. Its position varies: in the young specimen it forms

the base of the neural canal of the atlas ; in the Kimmeridge Clay species it is over-

lapped by the expanded bases of the neurapophyses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        and in P. Etheridgii, it occupies
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

the centre of the cup. The bases of the neurapophyses of the atlas are most deve-

loped in this species, and least in the Kimmeridge Clay species ; in all cases the an-

terior subvertebral wedge-bone forms a large portion of the atlantal cup. That the

suture between this bone and the os odontoideum, in the atlas of the species figured
--80 REPORT 1858.

by Prof. Owen in the 'Annals' for 1847, is correct, we have abundant proof in the

structure of the atlas of Pliosaurus, where the os odontoideum is of exactly the same
shape, and the wedge-bone separated from it by a similar suture.

    It is remarkable that the Kimmeridge Clay species approaches more nearly the
Ichthyosaurian type than the Lias species, not only in the greater development of the
OS odontoideum and in its lateral edges forming the lateral margins of the atlas, but
in its supporting the neurapophyses ; there is really no essential difference between

the atlas of this species and the atlas oi Ichthyosaurus.
   The atlas of P. Etheridm and that above' referred to, as figured by Prof. Owen,

show many Crocodilian affinities (the neurapophyses being supported both by the

wedge-bone and the centrum) ; but the posterior edge of the centrum does not sup-
port a pair of ribs (plurapophyses), and no trace of ribs articulating with the wedge-
bone has been discovered. The second vertebra of the same species supports cervical
ribs articulated to its body; but in all other respects it resembles that of the Crocodile.

Hemarks on certain Vermiform Fossils found in the Mountain Limestone

        Districts of the North of England. By Albany Hancock.

   After a full description of some peculiar crustacean funnels or tracks observed
on the sandy shores of Novthunibeiland and Durham, the author of this paper
examines in detail certain vermiform fossils obtained in the fine-grained, mica-
ceous sandstones of Haltwhistle, Wensleydale, and Pateley Bridge. These curious
fossils, of which there are two principal forms, one grooved, the other nodulous, had
hitherto been considered to be the remains of worms, or of worm-tubes, or the casts
of worm-tracks ; but the author objects to this opinion, on account of their great size,
their dissimilarity to worms, or tubes or tracks of worms ; and Ijecause certain cha-
racters exhibited by the fossils themselves preclude the idea of an organic origin.

He states, however, that they are undoubtedly tracks originally, as now, composed of

the same material as the slabs upon which they rest ; and the high probability that
they were formed by Crustaceans is deduced from the remarkable correspondence of
                   TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.     81

their characters to those of the runs or tunnels of these animals, as observed by him

 on our northern shores.

    Having arrived at this conchision, it is then suggested that these fossil tracks may

have been produced by Trilobites, wliicli agree very well in size with them. Tiie
largest tracks of the grooved form are a little above an inch wide. The width of the
pygidium of PhilUpsia tnmcaiula, a carboniferous species, is 1 1 lines, that of the
cephalic shield would probably be a little more ; therefore if allowance be made for
the thickness of the tunnel wall of the burrow or track, and the necessary enlargement
of the calibre beyond the width of the animal, it is evident that, so far as the size is
concerned, the largest tracks might be attributed to this species.

    The nodulous tracks are stated to be not more than half an inch wide ; there caia
therefore, be no difficulty as to size with respect to this form, for several species of
Trilobites are described to be about that size. And in conclusion it is remarked that
the large cephalic shield with its anterior or head-tubercle (glabella) and projecting
" cover of the eyes," appears well calculated to plough its way beneath the surface of
the sandy or muddy beach,

    Burmeister, indeed, in his work on the ' Organization of Trilobites,' published
by the Ray Society, expresses an opinion that their habits, like their structure, resem-

bled those of the Phyllopoda (a tribe of the Entomostraca), and that they "moved
only by swimming in an inverted position close beneath the surface of the water, and
did not creep about at the bottom as Klciden supposed." Though their habits may

have been similar to those of the Phyllopoda, there does not seem any good reason
for asserting that there was no deviation in this respect. In fact, the organization of

the two groups differs in so many particulars, that some variation in their modes of
life might naturally be looked for. The Trilobites may have occasionally swum at
the surface as supposed, and also have burrowed in the mud or sand at the bottom
of the water or on the beach. Season, too, may have modified their habits in these

respects.

On the Origin of the Breccias of the Soiithern Portion of the Valley of the

            Nith, Scotland. By Professor Harkness, F.G.S.

The southern portion of the Vale of the Nith consists of deposits of the Permian

age, capable of being divided into three groups. The lowest is composed of sand-

stones which afford footprints, the middle of thick breccias, and the upper of red

sandstone. The middle member is for the most part made up of angular fragments,

which have been derived from the Silurian strata surrounding the Permian area.

Besides these angular Silurian fragments, portions of red porphyries also occur in

these breccias, and these portions of porphyries have an equally angular character

with the Silurian fragments.

The porphyritic pieces which are imbedded in these rocks have no representatives

in the form of rocks of porphyry nearer than about twenty miles from the localities

where they present themselves; and no ordinary action of water is able to account

for their occurrence in an angular condition among the constituents of the breccias

of this locality.

Professor Ramsay has described the angular transported fragments which form the

Permian breccias of Worcestershire and Shropshire (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xi.

p. 185 el seq). In these breccias the fragments have their surfaces, in many in-
stances, well marked by grooves and striae, and they possess many features which

have induced Professor Ramsay to regard the breccias of these counties as having

resulted from the agency of ice, leading to the inference that Arctic conditions pre-

vailed during a portion of the Permian epoch,

The deposits which, in the southern portion of the Vale of the Nith, are composed

of angular fragments, do not bear about them the same features in the form of grooves

and stria which characterise the breccias described by Professor Ramsay. The

angular nature of the fragments, and the distance which some of them have been

transported, justify the conclusion that transport by water has not been the agent

which gave rise to these breccias ; and as no other force capable of transporting
angular fragments a considerable distance at present operates except ice, it becomes
necessary to refer the presence of these breccias to the same cause which gave rise to
those of Worcestershire and Shropshire. The absence of the grooves and strife from
the fragments which compose the Dumfriesshire breccias, indicates that the mode of
operation of the ice was somewhat different in these from those occurring in Wor-
cestershire and Shropshire. Glaciers seem to have had their influence in producing
the deposits in the latter areas, whilst in the former the ice seems to have acted prin-
cipally as a raft, transporting rocky fragments from one area to another. The cir-
cumstances which the breccias of the southern portion of the Vale of the Nith present,
seem to justify the conclusion of Professor Ramsay, that glacial conditions obtained
during part of the Permian epoch.

 Observations on the Genus Pteraspis, By Thomas H. Huxley, F.R.S,,

             Professor of Natural History, Government School of Mines.

   In a paper "On Cephalaspis and Pteraspis," recently read before the Geological

Society, and published in the ' Quarterly Journal' for the present year, I endeavoured

to prove,

    1st. That the Cephalaspis Lloydii and Lewisii of the author of the ' Recherches
sur les Poissons Fossiles,' subsequently united into a distinct genus, Pteraspis (Kner),
were rightly judged by Prof Agassiz to be the remains of fish, and that tliey are not,
as had been imagined by other naturalists, either Crustacean or Molluscan.

   2nd. That, as Prof. Agassiz had surmised, they are at once allied to Cephalaspis,
and generically distinct from it.

    I grounded these conclusions almost wholly on histological evidence, or that afforded
by the microscopic structure of the bodies in question. Not having seen the Cepha-
laspis rostratus of Agassiz, I abstained from offering any opinion with regard to it.

   Since the publication of my paper a great deal of new material has passed into my

hands, chiefly by the kindness of the zealous geologists and palaeontologists who reside
in and about Ludlow, Messrs. Cocking, Crouch, Harley, Lightbody, Marston, and

Salwey, and I have thereby been enabled greatly to extend and confirm my conclu-
Asions with regard to the nature and affinities of these remarkable extinct fishes.
brief note of tlie results at which I have now arrived will perhaps be interesting to

the Section.

   The oblong plates which have hitherto been the only discovered parts of Pteraspis,

form only a portion of the great shield which covered the anterior part of the dorsal
region of the body. Apparently anchylosed or continuous with the anterior edges of
some specimens of these plates, there is a bony disk, prolonged at its postero-lateral
angles into two long cornua, which pass into the edges of the oblong plate. The disk
exhibits the characteristic structure and the peculiar striated sculpture; it is prolonged
anteriorly into a sort of rostrum, whose length varies with the species of Pteraspis
laterally it exhibits two well-marked nearly circular marginal apertures, which I

make no doubt are the orbits.

    I conceive, therefore, that the part in question corresponds with the anterior part

of the cephalic disk of Cephalaspis, and that the oblong plate, which may well be

termed the occipito-nuchal plate, answers partly to the posterior moiety of the cephalic
disk of Cephalaspis, partly to that median backward prolongation of the posterior
margin of the cephalic disk of Cephalaspis to which I have particularly directed at-

tention in my memoir. It is from this that the strong nuchal spine of the Cephalaspis

arises ; and as if to render the resemblance complete, the most perfect specimens of
Pteraspis show that it had a like spine developed in a similar position.

   There exists, indeed, a most interesting gradational series of forms between Cephal-
aspis Lyellii and Pteraspis.

   The Auchenaspis of Sir Phihp Egerton has a cephalic disk with the semicircular
anterior outline of that of Ceph. Lyellii, but the interspace between the cornua of the
disk is nearly filled up by the large nuchal plate, whose backward extent may have
been greater than is exhibited by any of the specimens of Auchenaspis yet obtained.
Enlarge the nuchal plate oi Auchenaspis and give the cephalic disk a more produced
anterior outline, and the result is the form of Pteraspis,

                                                                            I
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                       83

   Througlio\it all these gradations of form, however, it must be borne in mind that
the minute structure of the parts is such as at once to enable the observer to di-
stinguish Cephalaspis from Pteraspis.

   I ventured in my paper read before the Geological Society, to say that the Ganoid
nature of Cephalaspis and Pteraspis appeared to me to be unproved, and to allude to

the relations between these genera and the great group of existing Siluroidei. "With-

out at all wishing to push too far resemblances which, when we come to know more,
may turn out to be mere analogies, I must say that the new facts which I have brought
forward appear to point somewhat in the same direction. The siluroid fishes, in fact,
are especially characterized by the large bony nuchal plate which supports the great
dorsal spine, and is constantly anchylosed to the posterior margin of the skull. The

rostrum of the Pteraspis is not without its analogue in Loricaria.

   On the other hand, that rostrum might be compared with the prolonged snout of
Acipenser ; and the shield of Pteraspis presents many points of similarity with the

cephalic buckler of such fishes as Dipterus, Diplopterus, and Osteolepis.

On the Jointed Structure of Rocks, particularly as developed in several places

  in Ireland. By Professor William King, F.G.S., Queen's College,

   Gahvay.

The author, adverting in the first place to the view which he advanced at the Dub-

lin Meeting on the so-called slaty cleavage in its perfect state, that it is the com-

bined effect of jointing, and of pressure exerted more or less perpendicularly to its

planes, stated, that he had since visited several localities in Mayo, Galway, Clare,

Limerick, Tipperary, Kerry, and Cork, and had obtained a number of important data

fully bearing out his view. His researches had also afforded him much insight into

--jointing a divisional structure of more importance in Physical Geologj', he thinks,

than appears to be generally understood. The author then proceeded to describe

jointing as it occurs in the Carboniferous limestones of Galway and Clare. In these

counties there may be made out four distinct sets of joints, two of which, from being

--east or west (the number of degrees varying) of compass north, he terms one, east

meridional, and the other, west meridional ; while the remaining two, which more or

--less rectangle the former, he designates one, east equatorial, and the other, south

equatorial. The east meridional set is the strongest and most regular : it runs in

an undeviating course for  miles  and  miles, generally from N.N.E.  to  S.S.W.                     plains,
                                                                                                 ;

valleys and mountains being all alike aflfected by it. In many places it cuts the

limestone into plates from half an inch to little more than an inch in thickness ; a

circumstance, favouring the idea, that, under proper conditions, jointing may be

developed to the utmost possible extent. None of the other three sets is so well

developed ; the south equatorial, which runs a few degrees south of west, is with

some difficulty made out. In consideration of the various phenomena which occurred

to him, he has formed the conclusion, that only horizontal or undisturbed beds ex-

hibit the original or normal direction of the joints with any certainty ; and consider-

ing that the beds which have the east meridional set running N.N.E. and S.S.W.

are horizontal, he concludes that such is the normal bearing of this set ; and he fur-

ther assumes, that any deviation from such direction has been caused by disturbances

of the strata. Entertaining these views, he applies them in elucidating and reconciling

certain complicated and seeming discordant phenomena; showing that some highly

inclined beds, striking east and west, like the limestones of Cork, may have one of

their sets of equatorial jointing lying horizontally ; while in others, having only their

basset edges exposed on the surface, the vertical and not the horizontal direction of

the joints is exhibited. Assuming the principal jointing in Yorkshire, Derbyshire,

Devonshire, and other counties to run generally from N.N.W. to S.S.E., as stated

by Phillips, Hopkins, De la Beche and others, he regards the west meridional as the

dominant set in England. This difference in direction between English and Irish

jointing is analogous to what occasionally obtains in the Dingle peninsula ; and a dif-

ference still more striking occurs within a space of a few yards or so, in a (Silurieui)

bed on the shore of Lough Mask. In connexion with the close approximation of

the joints, as rather frequently displayed in the Carboniferous limestone of the West

of Ireland, attention was directed to that form of divisional structure in coal, known

                                                                         6*

as cleat, and which has often been regarded as a sort of crj'stallization ; the author,
however, from various facts and reasonings, is decidedly of opinion that it is nothing
but jointing in a state of extreme development. Notwithstanding cleat being some-
times, as in pure coal, apparently as illimitable as mineral cleavage is in calcite or
fluor-spar, the author contends, that in ordinary coal it is undistinguishable from

the approximate jointing of many ancient argillaceous deposits. The paper con-
cluded by some observations on the so-called slaty cleavage in the brown and purple

shales of Cork : Professor King considers it as highly developed or cleat-like joint-
ing, belonging to one of the equatorial sets, and having had its planes forced into a
nearly vertical position by pressure exerted in a particular direction when the beds
were thrown into their present anticlinal and synclinal rolls : he considers that the
pressure was not sufficient to produce any other structural modification, or in other
words, that it was insufficient to bring the divisional planes in immediate contact, as
in true slate rocks ; hence the Cork shales generally are not illimitaMy cleavable, as

is the case with the former.

On the Geology of the Lake District, in reference especially to the Meta-
     morphic and Igneous Rocks. By J. G. Marshall, F.G.S.

  I propose in the present paper to confine my observations to the Cambrian and

older Silurian rocks of the Lake District, below the Coniston limestone ; consisting
of an alternating series of igneous and sedimentaiy strata, all of which have been
more or less acted upon by central heat.

   I shall endeavour to show that the phenomena observed may be best explained
by the supposition, that the whole series of rocks, granites included, are raetamor-

phic sedimentary strata, in situ, or in their natural order of position ; and that the
slaty rocks alternating with the porphyries are to be accounted for on the supposition
that they are by chemical composition less fusible, less easily acted upon by heat,

than the porphyritic beds, and have therefore been only hardened, retaining their

cleavage and stratified structure, whilst the more fusible rocks have been changed

into porphyries.

   The two oldest rock formations of the Lake District, the clay-slate of Skiddaw and
Saddleback, and the greenstone slate of Helvellyn and Scaw Fell, have, as is well

known, the usual north-east and south-west strike and south-east dip of the rocks of
the same age in Wales and Scotland. It is evident also that the district occupied by
them includes an anticlinal axis, for we find the greenstone slate on the northern

and north-west border of the clay-slate, as at Binsey, at the foot of Bassenthwaite,
dipping north or north-west. The first step in describing the physical structure of

the district will therefore be to ascertain the position of this anticlinal axis. I believe

that this point has not yet been completely or satisfactorily made out, and it was the

myfirst object of  recent walks over this country to gain some fresh light on the sub-

ject. There is perhaps no great geological interest attached to the ascertainment of

this point, considered as an isolated fact ; but considered in reference to the inquiry

into the relation of the granites of this district to the sedimentary rocks, it is of
some importance.

   This inquiry into the correlation. of granite and its accompanying metamorphic
rocks with the sedimentary strata, whose age is known by their organic remains, has
only lately attracted much notice from geologists. The vast labour of ascertaining the
true age and order of superposition of the whole range of sedimentary rocks chiefly by
their organic remains, had to be first accomplished. Accordingly we find that Sedg-

wick, in his description of this district, has not entered into the question at length

or in detail. In his letters to Mr. Wordsworth, he gives a section, which he is careful,

however, to tell us is only an ideal or explanatory, not an actual section of the rocks

of the district, showing their order of superposition. Here the Skiddaw granite is

placed at the base of the series of rocks, and in the anticlinal axis of the district.

This, though professedly only a provisional section, is one remarkable instance,
with innumerable others, of the very general disposition amongst geologists, to
assume tacitly that the origin and position of granite in the order of superposition

--of rocks is peculiar, quite distinct from that of all sedimentary strata. Accordingly

the granite apparently at the base of the clay-slate would be assumed to be in its

normal position, or at any rate more nearly so than the Eslidale and Shap Fells

granites which appear amongst the higher beds of the greenstone slate. These

--latter, together with the Ennerdale syenites, would be assumed to be eruptive, to'

have had their origin far below their present position, and to have been forced up in

mya melted state. It has been one principal object of  recent examination of this

district, to ascertain whether the facts bear out this prevailing conception as to the

origin and position of granite, or not.

It is of some importance, as one step in this inquiry, to ascertain whether or not

the Skiddaw granite is found in the anticlinal axis of the district.

At the last Meeting of this Association at Dublin, Prof. Harkness read a paper on

the geology of the Caldbeck Fells, and gave a section through Saddleback, the Syning-

Gill granite, and Caldbeck Fells, showing that the powerful greenstone dyke or

dykes which run through Caldbeck Fells, are the true anticlinal axis of this part of

the district, and not the granite. Both Prof. Phillips and the late Daniel Sharpe

have given sections through the whole range of Skiddaw to the foot of Bassen-

thwaite, showing a continued series of beds of clay-slate all dipping at about an

angle of 35° or 40° to the south-east. In all these particulars my own observations

agree with the descriptions previously given bj' these observers.

But though there seems to be no doubt that the Caldbeck Fells, running nearly

east and west, and having the greenstone slate strata on their northern bank plun-

ging down at high angles with a dip nearly north, but a little to the west of south,

is the actual anticlinal of the eastern portion of the Lake District, it cannot be con-

sidered as the normal anticlinal even of this portion of the district ; for the dip of the

strata of Skiddaw and Saddleback is uniformly to the south-east, agreeing with the

general dip and strike of the whole district, and not with the strike of Caldbeck Fells.

Hence we must conclude that the fracture of the strata and igneous outburst of

greenstone dykes which accompanied the elevation of Caldbeck Fells, was of later

date than the original elevation of the rocks of this district and the formation of the

anticlinal, which must have accompanied that elevation.

  We must look then for the original or normal anticlinal in the western part of the

district. The dip of the clay-slate in Whinlatter and Wythop Fells is south-east

nearly as far as the foot of Bassenthwaite. Here the beds of clay-slate may be seen
thrown into arches and much contracted ; and in Sale Fell indications of a reversal

of dip to the north-west begin to appear. But the strata at this point are much con-

fused by the intrusion of greenstone dykes and the proximity of the line of the

Caldbeck fault, which runs westward to a point near Cockermouth, crossing the line

of the original anticlinal.

The clay-slate in the mountains about Crummock Water and to the east of the Vale

of Lorton, have all the south-easterly dip. But in the range of hills to the west of the

Vale of Lorton I found a decided and regular anticlinal or reversal of dip, which may

be seen distinctly on the northern shore of Loweswater and in Revelin on the southern

shore of Ennerdale Water: in both cases the dip is W.N.W., about 10° or 15°.

We may consider a line drawn from near the foot of Bassenthwaite through Lowes-

water and the foot of Ennerdale Water, as the original or true anticlinal of the Lake

District, and that the upheaval along the line of Caldbeck Fells which completes the

north-western boundary is of subsequent date.. The angle formed by the Caldbeck

fault with the Ennerdale and Loweswater anticlinal, is the first indication of the

action of those forces, which by their complicated action have so dislocated the strata

of the Lake District. If we look to its south-eastern border, which is so distinctly

marked by the Coniston limestone, we shall see that the line from the head of Win-

dermere to Shap Fells granite is nearly parallel to the Caldbeck Fells fault, and

makes a considerable angle with the direction of the western part of the southern

boundary, showing that the strike of the whole of the beds in the eastern part of the

district has been twisted out of its original direction. I shall have occasion to revert

to this fact when I am endeavouring to trace the nature and direction of the

elevating forces which have raised up the strata.

I now proceed to describe what appeared to me to be the relative position of the

granite to the overlying slate rocks at the three points where it is seen in the Lake

country.

The appearance of the grey granite of Skiddaw at Syning Gill in the valley of the
--86 REPORT 1858.

Calder, between Saddleback and the Caldbeck Fells, and the gradual transition in
the beds above it from glossy clay-slate to cbiastolite slate, hornblende slate and

gneiss immediately in contact with the granite, have been so often and so well

described, that I must not repeat what is already known. What was material to
my present purpose to observe was, that the granite seemed to me to comport itself

in all respects as if it were simply another term in the series of metamorphic

changes following the gneiss.

   The general dip of the beds of clay-slate in Skiddaw and to the westward is about
40° to the south-east. In the northern flank of Saddleback, and near the point

where the granite appears, this dip has increased to 60° ; in the bed of the Calder, at
the foot of Caldbeck Fells, I observed it about 80° ; and in the hills above it seems
to have become nearly vertical where any dip or stratification can be made out.
The point in Syning Gill, on the northern slope of Saddleback where the granite
appears, is very little above the level of the bottom of the valley. The granite occu-

pies the bottom of the valley, and rises up the southern slope of the Caldbeck Fells

--to a considerably higher elevation than that of Syning Gill, perhaps 200 or 300

feet above the valley.

The upper boundary of the granite is therefore a line dipping to the south-east,

but at a lower angle than that of the beds of clay-slate, and cutting obliquely across

them. If we suppose the clay-slate to have had originally the general dip of 40°

before the elevation of the Caldbeck Fells fault tilted them up to a higher angle, then

the upper boundary of the granite would have been nearly horizontal, representing

the isothermal line of igneous fusion ; and we should have the beds of clay-slate

dipping towards and into this line, and converted into granite as they passed below

it*. No veins of any importance have been observed penetrating from the granite

into the rocks above, nor did I see any other indication of this granite having been

eruptive or intrusive, or having in any way disturbed the overlying strata.

The Skiddaw granite is found, as we have seen, amongst the middle or lower beds

Weof the clay-slate formation.  next find granite amongst the lower beds of the

greenstone slate formation in Eskdale and Miterdale ; and this is by much the most

extensive granitic region.

   In order to explain the position of this Eskdale granite, I must first describe the

remarkable geological position of Black Comb and the range of hills forming the
eastern boundary of Eskdale. Black Comb is a huge isolated mass of clay-slate

2000 feet thick, heaved up amongst the highest of the greenstone slate series of
rocks, having the Coniston limestone immediately upon its south-eastern flank.

What is the relation of the clay-slate to the greenstone slate beds ? Is it cut off

on all sides abruptly by great faults ; or have the neighbouring greenstone beds

been raised along with it, and do they rest conformably upon it ? What is the

relation of the clay-slate to the granite ? Is there any evidence that the granite

either underlies the clay-slate or else is distinctly eruptive ?

   It was my object, in a recent examination of the Black Comb range, to find an
answer to these questions. I found the central mass of Black Comb dipping nearly due
north about 20°. On the western and eastern flanks of the mountain the dip becomes

north-west and north-east respectively. I found the same dip in direction and amount

in the whole of the ridge of greenstone slate running continuous with Black Comb,
as far at least as Devock Water, to which point I more particularly observed it.
These greenstone slate beds seemed to me to be clearly the lower coarse conglomerate
slates and porphyries of that formation. The actual junction of these rocks with the

clay-slate is generally covered up ; but the clay-slate and coarse greenstone slate

may be seen in the course of a stream crossing the road from Bootle over Stoneside

Fell, within 20 yards of each other and clearly quite conformable in dip, and the
character of each rock as perfectly distinct as if they had been found miles apart. I

found these lower greenstone slate beds completely wrapping round the north-
western border of the clay-slate as far as Bootle, as shown in Sedgwick's map.

These rocks dip north-west or towards the granite, and distinctly separate it from the

   * If this line is continued underneath Saddleback southwards, it will very nearly indicate
the position of the syenite at the foot of St. John's Vale, an igneous rock appearing amongst
the higher beds of the clay-slate.

                                                                                               I
                                                                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      87

clay-slate. On the eastern flank of Black Comb I found the same beds of coarse

greenstone slate wrapping round the clay-slate, and separated from the upper beds

of finer roofing-slate by a line of fault running north and south, and nearly following

a road running from Beck Bank on to Stoneside Fell. On the south-western border
of Black Comb the new red sandstone comes up to the clay-slate.

  It appears then, if my observations are correct, that the Black Comb range on the

east of Eskdale consists of an axis of elevation running north and south, and which

has elevated both the clay-slate and the lower beds of the greenstone slate in con-
formable position ; and that the latter have a north-westerly dip towards the granite

in the lower part of the valley. As we have the same lower beds of the greenstone

slate in the range of the Screes on thesouth-eastof Wast Water dipping towards the

south-east, there seems good evidence to conclude that Eskdale and Miterdale, taken

together, may be considered as a broad synclinal valley subdivided by subordinate

Weanticlinal ridges.                                                     must then consider this as a great valley of denudation,

exposing the granite in its lower parts, and Scaw Fell and the other lofty mountains

at its head, consisting of the setting on of the higher beds of the great greenstone

slate formation.

It remains to be ascertained whether the granite is eruptive and intrusive, ormeta-

morphic, in the latter case consisting of the lower beds of the greenstone slate, which

lying at the bottom of a trough, have been more exposed than the neighbouring

strata to the central heat, and also have been more deeply covered up.

    I think all the direct evidence on the spot is strongly in favour of the latter sup-

position. Sedgwick, who examined this district with great care many years ago,

states that the granite is everywhere bordered by a belt of transition metamorphic

rocks, by which it appears to graduate into the greenstone slate.

   These transition beds between the greenstone slate and granite may be well

observed in the course of the stream running from Devock Water into the Esk, and
also under the Screes at the foot of Wast Water.

The unaltered rocks in the hills about Devock Water consist of a bluish grey

felstone porphyry, with small crystals of quartz or hornblende. The first change

on approaching the granite is that this rock loses its porphyritic character, and be-

comes a very dark, almost black compact greenstone. The next change is to a soft

crumbling rock, with an entire change of colour to various shades of red, yellow, or

pinkish grey                                                             after this, finally, a transition  through several varieties of quartzoze
                                                                      ;

and crystalline rock to compact crystalline granite. In the Eskdale granite the mica

is very commonly wanting or replaced by hornblende.

The thickness of these transition beds is various. Under the Screes they did not

seem to me to occupy more than 60 or 80 feet ; but near Devock Water between

200 and 300 feet.

An important point to be observed here is, whether the upper limit of the granite

is on the whole conformable to the dip of the greenstone strata above it. The whole

of the Screes is so hardened by heat and so shattered, that it is difficult to ascertain

the dip of small portions, though the whole mass evidently has an easterly dip. The

line of soft metamorphic rocks marking the upper limit of the granite is seen near

the foot of Wast Water, apparently running quite conformably under the beds of

greenstone slate of Screes. The position of the granite near Burnmoor Tarn, at the

foot of Scaw Fell, is also quite analogous to that at Devock Water.

I think I may be justified in saying that the direct evidence to be obtained on the

spot, in the case both of the Skiddaw and of the Eskdale granite, is in favour of their

metamorphic character.                                                   myIt will make  argument more clear and intelligible, if I

proceed to notice in the same manner the direct evidence to be obtained by observa-

tion upon the spot, as it appeared to me at the time, in the case of the other igneous

rocks of the district, the syenite of Ennerdale, and the granite of Shap Fells, before

I inquire what objections may be raised to this hypothesis, and what may be alleged

for or against the contrary hypothesis, that these igneous rocks are not metamorphic,

but eruptive and intrusive.

   The syenite of Ennerdale occupies an intermediate position, as is seen upon the
map, between the clay-slate and the greenstone slate. Is it an intrusive eruptive

rock, or is it metamorphic, consisting of some of the upper beds of the clay-slate
changed into syenite ?
--88 REPORT 1858.

I followed its boundarj' from Seatoller under the mountain Hay Cock, Steeple, and

Pillar, to the point where it crosses the Liza river in Ennerdale.

   The greenstone beds here consist of the coarse conglomerate slate similar to those
resting on the flanks of Black Comb: the general dip is to the south-east. There is
a similar border of transition rocks between the clay-slate and the syenite, to that
between the same rock and the granite, a nearly black greenstone and beds of softened

rock, but they are less regular and less considerable. I followed the upper limit of
the syenite as it descends the southern side of Ennerdale under Pillar, and it seemed

to me to be on the whole conformable to the beds of greenstone slate resting upon

it : so also on the northern side of the valley, the syenite is seen ranging under the
greenstone slate of High Stile. About half-way down Ennerdale Water the clay-

slate appears with a south-east dip underlying the syenite. In the western flank of

Revelin, the mountain on the southern bank at the foot of the lake, the dip of the

strata is distinctly W.N.W. at an angle of about 10°, whilst the dip on the eastern

flank of the same hill near the syenite is south-east ; thus the principal anticlinal of

the district is shown to pass through the middle of Revelin. I found the W.N.W.

dip also at a corresponding point on the south side of the lake, in a gill at Crosslands.

The strata on the northern side of Ennerdale, between Floutarn Tarn and Red Pike,

are much broken up and confused by faults and entanglements of masses of the clay-

slate in the syenite, as described by Sedgwick.

   On the whole, the direct evidence to be obtained on the spot seemed to me to be

in favour of the supposition tha*". the syenite is metamorphic, consisting of the upper

bed of the clay-slate. I may mention, as confirming this opinion, that the transition

beds of syenite in Ennerdale contain the same crystals of Chiastolite, which are such

a distinguishing mark of the transition beds immediately above the Skiddaw granite.
In support of this hypotliesis, I may observe that syenite in mass is found near

Keswick in St. John's Vale, in a position exactly similar to that of Ennerdale; that

is, immediately under the lowest beds of the greenstone slate. If this hypothesis is
correct, the syenite must lie below the Eskdale granite, which I suppose to consist of

the lower beds of the greenstone slate ; and the position of the mass of syenite on
the northern bank of Wast Water is quite consistent with that supposition, as the

general dip of the strata is to the south-east.

The only remaining area of igneous rock which I have to notice is that of the

Shap Fell granite. This granite is very limited in extent, though very decidedly

marked in character, and so well known by its boulders scattered far and wide by

the northern drift. It constitutes the end of a range of rough porphyritic rock

which immediately underlies the Coniston limestone through its entire course,

and which here passes under the mountain limestone belt which encircles the Lake
mountains on their eastern border. All the neighbouring rocks are much indurated

and altered by heat. In approaching the granite from the west, the Coniston lime-
stone is lost, and the flagstone above it much altered for some miles in extent. The
granite has evidently been in a highly fluid state, and has extensively penetrated the

adjoining slate rocks in ramifying veins. But I saw no evidence of any great faults

or other disturbance of the natural order of the strata ; and in the absence of this

evidence, the only conclusion I could arrive at was, that this granite also is meta-

morphic, consisting of the highest bed of the greenstone slate, viz. the rough por-

phyry immediately underlying the Coniston lime.

   I have now completed the direct evidence to be obtained on the spot as to the

relative position of the granites and slate rocks, and I must proceed to notice the

Howdifficulties and objections which may be made to the metamorphic hypothesis.

can we account for this metamorphic action of the central heat having been produced

at such very different depths in the series of strata, from the lower beds of the

Skiddaw slate to the highest of the greenstone series .'

I think this may be explained on the simple supposition that the strata were

Wealready inclined before the metamorphic change took place.  must take into

account also the much greater denudation of superincumbent strata which we know

takes place in some localities, than is observed in others. Combining these two pos-
tulates, I think we may arrive at a fair solution of the difficulty. If we look at the

map, we see that the Shap Fells granite occurs at the south-east corner of the di-

strict, just where the dip of the strata would carry the upper beds down the deepest.

outline of these granitic areas, and suppose for a moment that these boundaries are

great faults lifting up the strata some 5000 or 10,000 feet.
   Again, if these granites and syenites were all eruptive from some unknown depth

common to all of them, it would be difficult to account for the distinct and separate

type or character which each possesses.

   I venture to come to the general conclusion, therefore, that both positive and
negative evidence favours the hypothesis, that the whole phenomena of the granitic

and igneous rocks of the Lake District are a grand and very interesting exhibition

of metamorphic action on a large scale. I feel that there is still a difficulty remain-

Weing which will occur to most of us.      have been accustomed to look to the violent

eruption of those igneous masses as the cause of the upheaval, fractures, faults, and

contortions of these mountain regions. Take away this cause, and what adequate

causes have we left to which such effects can be attributed ?

   This inquiry would lead me to enter upon a subject of very high interest, but so
wide and large in its bearings, that I feel it almost presumptuous in me to deal with

it at all in such a presence as that I see round me. I may venture to give a mere
outline of what has occurred to my own mind, which may serve as a starting-point

to those much more competent than I am to treat of such a subject, and may at least

aflford some suggestions that may be worked out.

Since the time when Hutton and Playfair, Cuvier and Smith re-formed and re-

founded, as it were, the theory of geology, the exertions of geologists have been

chiefly directed to the completion of the vast labour of making out the stratigraphic

order of position, and the accompanying series of organic remains of the whole stra-

tified crust of the earth. It is only from time to time, and more especially of Jate

years, and by no one more than by our present President, that the study of the

Dynamics of Geology has occupied much attention.

It would seem that the progress of geology must shortly bring these questions

much more prominently forward. The point to which I wish at present to draw

attention, is the expansion and working out of some very remarkable and important

suggestions first made by Babbage in 1834, and illustrated by Sir John Herschel in

a letter to Sir C. Lyell, in 1836, on the causes which may have produced the eleva-

tion or submergence of continents. I must refer to the letter itself for a complete

exposition of Sir J. Herschel's view; I can only now quote such portions as are

immediately necessary to my argument.
  --The results arrived at appear to be :

1. The transference of solid matter by abrasion from continents, and its deposit

at the bottoms of oceans, disturb the equilibrium both of heat and pressure. The

isothermal lines of internal heat will rise under the bottom of the ocean and fall

under the continent ; the strata under the ocean will be heated and thereby expanded,

and thus the bottom will be raised. Again, the whole crust of the earth being sup-

posed to be floating upon a fluid ocean of melted rock, the increase of weight in

some parts and diminution in others will tend to crack or break the crust in its

weakest parts.
   2. These cracks or fractures, produced by general and constantly acting causes,

will give rise to volcanic vents and earthquakes. Thus volcanic phenomena become
of secondary importance ; they are not the causes of the elevation of continents and
mountain chains, but the consequence of such movements produced by far more

general and constantly acting forces.

   I may remark, that in all these speculations on the effects which the expansion of

strata caused by the incursion of heat from below will produce, the expansion in a

vertical direction alone has been adverted to.

   But I think it is evident that the expansion which will take place in the bottom of
an ocean 1000 or 2000 miles wide, will be very much greater in a horizontal or late-

ral direction than vertically, in the proportion which a length of 1000 miles bears to

the thickness of 20 or 30 miles.

  The enormous lateral thrusts which will be thus produced, seem to me to consti-

tute an adequate dynamic force for producing those vast wave-like wrinkles and con-
volutions and tilting up and even inversion of strata which we see in mountain

chains -. for on the supposition that the bottom of the sea, subject to tension by ex-
pansion from heat, would give way at the weakest points, we are enabled to explain
                                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                            91

why these contortions of the strata should be accumulated on particular lines, and

not generally distributed. Tliey occur where the crust of the earth happens to have

been weakest ; and thus the whole effects of the expansion of 1000 miles of strata

may be found within the compass of 100 or of 10 miles. If, then, we regard moun-

tain chains generally as the convoluted and upturned edges of strata produced by

enormous lateral pressure, I venture to think we shall approach much nearer to a true

conception of the causes which have been at work, than in attributing such elevatory

movement to perfectly vague and arbitrary volcanic forces. Another and a distinct

cause has also been assigned for lateral pressure, which should throw the crust of the

earth into wave-like elevations and depressions ; viz. the contraction of the internal
nucleus by cooling. The effects of the two causes would be similar, but the former

would appear, I think, to be the more energetic and important.

I think the application of the principle, that the elevatory forces which raise moun-

tain chains are to be looked for in lateral thrusts, will assist in forming a true con-

ception of the forces which have dislocated the Lake District. Mr. Hopkins, our

present President, has shown how the conformation of this district, the tendency in

the valleys to converge towards a central point, may be in great part accounted for

by the supposition that an elevatory force has acted on a line running nearly east

and west from Shap Fells, through Helvellyn and Scaw Fell. The result would be

a series of cracks or faults in the directions in which the valleys now run. This

supposition 1 think accounts for a part of the phenomena, but not for the whole

Aof them.                                simple vertical force acting on the line supposed would neither account,

I think, for the contortions of the strata in Shap Fells showing lateral pressure, for

instance, nor for the fact that in all the valleys on the south of the line, the eastern

side of the fault should be elevated, the western depressed. But if we observe that

Shap Fells, the point where this line of elevation commences, is in the corner where

the two great lines of the Pennine and Cross Fell faults meet at an angle, and sup-

pose the elevatory force along this Une to be the resultant of two lateral thrusts

at right angles to these two great faults, I think we shall approach a true solution

of the phenomena observed;

I cannot on the present occasion do more than dip info this most interesting and

important department of Dynamic Geology ; but I may perhaps have said enough

myto give a consistent meaning to                           description of the geology of this portion of the

Lake District.

It only remains for me to give some reasons for the supposition that the beds of

porphyry interstratified in the greenstone slate series have been originally aqueous

deposits changed into porphyry by metamorphic heat, combined with pressure, and

the presence of water. It has been remarked long ago by Sedgwick, that the slaty

and porphyritic beds of the greenstone slate formation are not separated or distin-

guishable from each other by any constant or clear characteristics. They run into

each other almost indefinitely, both in passing across the strata from one bed to the

next, and even in following the same bed along its line of bearing. This is some-

times shown in a striking manner in the weathered surfaces of the rocks. These sur-

faces may show externally all the marks of a stratified bed, the bedding, the joints,

the cleavage, marked even by light-coloured stripes, and yet the first stroke of the

hammer dispels the illusion; the rock is found to be a compact porphyry, which will

not split according to the seeming external lines either of cleavage or joints. If any

rocks are metamorphic, then these porphyritic beds have, I think, every external mark

of being so.

   I may here quote the words used by Sedgwick in his last work on Palaiozoic
Rocks. Speaking of the Cambrian greenstone slate formation, he says, " The mo-

difications of the slate are first described, and it is shown that they pass on one

hand into compact felspathic slate, sometimes porphyritic ; on the other into coarse

granular and concretionary slaty masses, and through them into breccias or pseudo-

breccias                                 all these changes  being eft'ected without any change of strike or dip.  In
                                      ;

like manner it is shown lliat the amorphous, and even semicolumnar prismatic por-

phyries, are not only arranged in directions parallel to the tabular masses of green

roofing-slate, but pass themselves into a slaty texture with a strike and dip pai-allel

to those of the true roofing-slates. From these facts, as well as from the negative

facts, that the porphyries never penetrate the roofing-slates in the form of dykes, and
--92 REPORT 1858.

produce no mineral change in the beds of limestone resting on them, it is inferred

that the tohule group in one formation, which has originated in the simultaneous action

of aqueous and igneous causes long continued." Again, he maintains, " that many
rocks, which now have a perfect porphyritic structure, were so far aqueous deposits,

that they had been spread out into beds by the action of the sea, and that their actual
structure (though certainly metamorphic) was not the effect of torrefaction or of

heat emanating from any eruptive or igneous centre. On the contrary, that the na-

tural temperature at great depths, combined with great pressure long continued, was
a cause quite sufficient to explain the phenomena of the old stratified plutonic rocks."

   The only important modification which I venture to propose in this statement is,
that we must distinguish between the aqueous causes really simultaneous with the
igneous ; viz. the water or steam present in the rock when undergoing metamorphic

changes at great depths by heat and pressure, and from the aqueous causes acting

long before, when these beds were deposited as true rudimentary strata at the bot-

tom of the ocean.
    If the positive evidence, then, is strong in favour of these rocks being metamorphic,

I think the negative evidence is not less so. In regions where igneous rocks abound

which are clearly eruptive, we have many characteristic marks of their origin.

They have a distinct mineral character and structure ; they do not graduate into

Weslaty rocks.  have distinct evidence of their overflowing neighbouring strata.

We have distinct evidence of the manner of their eruption from below in the presence

of many vertical dykes.
   None of these phenomena are observed in the Lake District, as regards the por-

phyries alternating with the slates. The ordy difficulty to be accounted for, I think,

is the great thickness of some of the slaty beds, which have remained unaltered whilst
other beds above them have been changed by the action of the same heat into por-

phyry.

   It is evident, that if the diflferent beds can be shown to be of different degrees of
fusibility, this circumstance would be at once accounted for ; and I have made some

experiments to test this point, and also on tiie eftects of fusion and slow cooling in

producing metamorphic effects upon rocks.

   The first experiment was made for me by Mr. J. P. Wood, of Leeds, on clay-

slate, greenstone porphyry, and greenstone roofing-slate, all reduced to fine powder,

and about I lb. of each placed in three crucibles', in a common air-furnace, and gra-

dually heated. At a good red heat the porphyry puffed up, fused, and ran over the
edge of the crucible in the shape of a brown glassy slag ; at a white heat the clay-
slate fused into a grey glassy slag ; and, lastly, at a strong white heat, the roofing-
slate also fused into a black glassy slag. Thus the slate rocks appear to be decidedly
less fusible ; less easily acted upon by heat than the porphyries. The same result
was obtained [in fusing clay-slate, Skiddaw granite, and greenstone porphyry in a

common reverberatory furnace ; the stone being broken into pieces, about the size

of those used for road-making, a white heat was required to fuse them, but the
granite and porphyry melted much more readily and completely than the clay-slate.
These simple experiments may be sufficient to prove a difference in the fusibility of
the slaty and porphyritic beds, which would account for the latter undergoing changes
by the same heat which would merely harden the former.

    I next endeavoured to ascertain the effect of pressure combined with heat on the
fusion of rocks, with the very able and zealous assistance of Messrs. Kitson and
Hewitsou, of this town. These experiments, which are attended with great difficulty,

and require the patient endurance of a good many partial failures before a success-

ful result can be obtained, are as yet only in progress.

   Some results, however, may be seen in the specimens on the table.
   The powdered granite, clay-slate, and porphyry were enclosed in strong iron tubes,

well consolidated to begin with by hydraulic pressure, then screwed up and heated
to a red heat in an air-furnace, and then slowly cooled.

   The result is a compact mass of distinctly stony texture approaching to slaty
greenstone, quite different from the porous glassy slags produced by fusion without
pressure. The fusion has taken place at a lower temperature under pressure.
                                                                                    ;

                      TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                      93

I next tried the effect of fusion of a large mass of granite, in this case from the

Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, which happened to be most easily procurable.

This was done in a reverberatory furnace constructed for the purpose by Messrs. Kit-

son and Hewitson, but the accidental failure of a portion of the furnace in the course

of the experiment partially spoiled the result. The specimens, however, show a di-

stinct passage from a perfectly glassy to a stony texture, and apparently even to a por-

phyritic structure by the development of crystals.

There are also specimens of the glassy texture, which by exposure to heat just

below fusion in close tubes for two or three weeks, are changed to a stony texture

also of the powdered rocks enclosed in a strong iron tube, and buried in the large

mass of granite when in a state of fusion in the reverberatory furnace.

The great desideratum, however, is the application of heat under high pressure

with the presence of water, which must have been the condition, as remarked by

MySedgwick, of the metamorphic rocks.  attempts in this direction have not yet

succeeded. It is no easy matter to construct any sort of vessel capable of keeping

red-hot water in safe custody.

     Photographs of the Quarry of Rowley Rag at Ponh Hill, Walsall.

                       By William Mathews, F.G.S.

   The well-known basaltic capping of Ponk Hill in the South Staffordshire coal-
field is being so rapidly worked away, that it has seemed desirable that some record
of its structure should be preserved. With this view the photographs laid before
the Section have been taken ; they represent the whole of the face of rock now being
quarried, from which the original structure of the mass may be easily ascertained.
It formed when entire an irregular dome, communicating below with the extensive
horizontal sheet of basalt intruded between the coal-measures, and consisted of two

distinct sets of columns.

   1st. An interior cylindrical group of very perfect vertical columns, rapidly thin-

ning and arching over at the top some distance below the vertex of the dome.
   2nd. Another group originating at the summit of the first, dipping down over

their arched extremities, and then curving upwards so as to strike the exterior of the
dome nearly perpendicular to its surface.

   The columns are all situated in vertical planes passing approximately through the
axis of the dome.

On Triassic Beds near Frome, and their Organic Remains.
                     ByC. Moore, F.G.S.

   The author stated he became aware of the probable presence of Triassic beds in
the neighbourhood of Frome, by finding a slab of conglomerate containing teeth of
Acrodus, Hyhodus, and Saurichthj/s on a roadside heap of carboniferous limestone.

He at once examined the district for their discovery without success ; but more

recently was fortunate enough to find fissures of the carboniferous limestone at
Holwell, filled with a similar conglomerate, the organic remains in which evidenced

its Triassic origin.

   In describing the physical features of the district, the author remarked that Frome
was situated on the extreme south-eastern boundary of the Somersetshire coal-field,

and that just north of that town the old red sandstone, with a narrow belt of car-

boniferous limestone lying on its side, might be seen emerging from beneath the
inferior oolite. To the west the carboniferous limestones again appear in several
pretty combs leading to Mells, Vallis, and Whatley, in the latter of which the

Holwell quarries are situated. In the quarry opposite this village the limestone

Ais worked to a depth of 35 feet.  fissure about a foot in breadth, commencing

under a thin capping of vegetable soil, may be here observed, taking an irregular

direction to the bottom of the quarry, where it increases to 10 feet in breadth. This

Ais in part filled with vertical laminse of mottled yellow, grey and blue stone.

quartzose sand also prevails, sometimes indurated, but often friable; in which case,

the imbedded organic remains may be readily detached.

First amongst these the Reptilia deserve notice, some of which belong to the The-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

codont order which includes the Thecodontosaurus and Palceosmirtis. Of the former,
the author has obtained several teeth and vertebrae, and also several bonj- scutes
or scales, which renders it probable one of the saurians of this period was covered
with a bony armour like the Teleosaurus of the lias. These genera were originally
described bv Messrs. Riley and Stutchbury, from fragmentary specimens obtained
from a conglomerate near Bristol, which has hitherto been considered to belong to

the Permian period or to the dolomitic conglomerate, but from its precise litholo-

gical similarity to that of Holwell there can now be little doubt it belongs to the

Triassic period. In referring to the absence of the Muschelkalk in this country, the
author stated he had the pleasure of announcing, that, although the precise equivalent

-- --of that formation had not yet been satisfactorily made out, still in the presence of

the teeth of another saurian the Placodus he had obtained the first indications of
the fauna of that deposit being represented in England.

    Important as were these indications of Reptilia, the fish remains from these con-
glomerates were probably of equal interest. They belong to the genera Aa-odu«,
Hyhodm, Saurichthys, Lepidotus, Gyrolepis, probably the Ctenoptychius or Peta-
lodus of Owen, and some minute palates allied to Chomatodus, a genus not yet found
higher than the carboniferous limestone. Teeth of the Acrodus, of several species,
are very abundant, the next prevailing genus being the Hyhodus. There are also
some very peculiar thorn-like spines of not less than ten distinct varieties, belonging
to some fish as yet undetermined, to the dermal coverings of which they were pro-
bably attached. So wonderfully preserved are some of these fish remains, that the
author had been enabled to extract a jaw from the matrix, which, though not more
than the eighth of an inch in length, contains all its teeth, thirty-four in number
and in another instance, a palate a quarter of an inch in length still retains seventy-
four teeth, and shows blank spaces from which sixteen others had been lost.

   The only evidence the author has yet obtained of regularly stratified Triassic beds
is in the Vallis Vale, where there are several large quarries of carboniferous lime-
stone, on the up-turned edges of which the inferior oolite lies horizontally, and is

usually in immediate contact. This, however, is not the case in one near Hapsford
Mills, where the following thin bands of Trias are found. Immediately on the
carboniferous limestone, which is here quarried to the depth of 20 feet, occurs a
bed of blue clay 4 inches in thickness, which yielded part of a Thecodont vertebra,
fish remains identical with some from the Holwell conglomerate, and the teeth of
several spines oi Acrodi peculiar to this bed. It also yielded valves of Chiton and
Pollicipes, with spines of Pseudodiadema and stems of encrinites, together with
Ostrea, Lima, Avicula, and other shells. Succeeding this blue clay, is a bed of hori-

zontal conglomerate 2 feet thick, made up of rounded pebbles, from the size of an
egg downwards, and containing a few fish teeth and scales. Above is another band

of blue clay 4 inches in thickness, passing into a grey concretionary clay 12 inches

thick, neither of which has yielded any organic remains ; and resting on these next
succeed rubbly beds of inferior ooHte, having a thickness of 12 feet.

    Various other Mollusca have been obtained by the author from the beds above
noticed, including Spirifer, Terebratula, Rkynchonella, Lingula, fragments of the
large Discina Townshendi, which the author believed to be a triassic shell, Pecten,
Belemnite, &c., and a single claw of a crustacean.

  --IS'ote. Since reading the above paper, it has been the author's good fortune to

discover three unmistakeable mammalian teeth identical with the Microlestes an-

tiquus of the Upper Trias of Wirtemberg, being the earliest evidence of mamma-

 lian remains yet found in this country.

 Some Itesuits of recent Uesearclies among the Older Rocks of the Highlands

                of Scotlaiid. By Sir R. I. Murchison, F.R.S.

    The first part of the paper consisted chiefly of a confirmation and extension of views
 which the author had laid before the Geological Society in the preceding session.
 These views are, that the fundamental gneiss of the N.W. Highlands, being older than
 any stratified rock of England and Wales, is overlaid unconformably by sandstones
 and conglomerates of great thickness, which, occupying lofty mountains, represent the
 Cambrian rocks of South Britain ; that these are surmounted transgressively by quartz

rocks and limestones containing Lower Silurian fossils, or that the last are suc-

ceeded by micaceous schists and flagstones often passing into a younger gneiss.
   The second part of the communication related to the Old Red Sandstone, properly

so defined, as exhibited on the east coast, between the Orkney and Shetland Islands

on the north, and Banffshire and Morayshire on the south, various points of which

the author visited last summer. In Caithness and the Orkney Islands, accompanied

by Mr. Peach, the author made various interesting additions to his former knowledge,

and profited by tlie researches of Mr. Robert Dick of Thurso. His belief was sus-

tained that the ichthyolitic flagstones of Caithness and the Orkneys, witli their
numerous fossil fishes, constitute the central member of the Old Red series, the lower

part of which is made up of powerful conglomerates and a very great thickness of

thin-bedded red sandstone, the whole being composed of the detritus of the more

ancient crystalline rocks. The central flagstones are surmounted by other sandstones,
rarely red, and usually of yellow colour, which occupy the promontories of Hoy Head,

Dunnet Head, &c.

The chief additional data which had been gained by Sir Roderick during his last

visit were owing, in the first instance, to a discovery by Mr. Martin of Elgin, of a

large bone in the same beds at Lossie Mouth, which had formerly affbrded large

scales of the supposed fish, called Staganolepis by Agassiz. On visiting these quar-

ries with the Rev. G. Gordon, he was so fortunate as to discover other portions of

this large animal ; so that comparative anatomists may determine whether it be, as

the author believed, really reptilian. 1 he existence of reptiles during the forma-

tion of this deposit is, indeed, established beyond a doubt; since many slabs have

long been found in tlie coast quarries of Cummingston, in which are the footprints of

both large and small reptiles, each footprint having the impression of four or five

Aclaws to it.  slab, transmitted by Capt. Brickenden, is in the Geological Society's

Museum, and others have recently been sent to the Museum of Practical Geo-

logy, London, as contributions from Mr. P. Duff of Elgin, and other persons. The

presence of large reptiles, as well as of the little Telerpeton, in a deposit which all

geologists have hitherto considered to be an upper member of the Old Red Sandstone,

is therefore established.

After liOting cei-tain fossil fishes which occur in parts of the Duke of Richmond's

estates in Banffshire, the author proceeded to review the relations of the great masses

of sedimentary deposit lying along the eastern and southern faces of the crystalline

rocks of the Grampians, which have been hitherto classed as pertaining to the Old

Red Sandstone, though he does not pretend as yet to be competent to describe their
detailed features. On these points, however, which Mr. D. Page is working out with
ability, he begs to offer the following suggestion. The true base of the Old Red

Sandstone, properly so called, is seen in Shropshire and Herefordshire to be a red

rock, containing Cephalaspis and Pteraspis, which gradually passes down into the
grey Ludlow rock ; and in both of these contiguous and united strata, remains of large

Pterygoti, but of different species in the two bands, are found. Now, although the

Arbroath paving-stone, and the grey rocks ranging to the north of Dundee, litholo-

gically much resemble the uppermost Ludlow rock, they contahi the Cephalaspis

Lyellii as well as Pterygoti, and must, rmder every circumstance, be viewed as the

base of the Devonian rocks. In speaking of the lowest member of the Old Red Sand-

stone, as characterized by the Cephalaspis, the author expressed his conviction, that

in the north-eastern Highlands and Caithness that zone is represented as above men-
tioned, by the vast thickness of thin-bedded red sandstone and conglomerates, which

underlies the bituminous flags of Caithness.

   The author, who had recently visited Dura Den, in Fifeshire, in the company of
Lord Kinnaird and the Rev. Dr. J. Anderson, whose work, ' The Course of Creation,'
is well known to geologists, declared that there could be no doubt that the yellow

sandstones, that tract in Fife which pertains truly to the Old Red group, are entirely

subjacent to the lowest carboniferous sandstones, and are probably of the same age as

Athe upper yellow sandstones of Elgin.  drawing, prepared by Lady Kinnaird (the

splendid specimen having been placed in the museum at Rossie Priory), of the fossil

in tlie lower and redp ovtions of the deposit, and also occurs in the overlying yellow
sandstones, associated with other old red ichthyolites, the age of tlie deposit is clearly

substantiated.

    In conclusion, Sir Roderick said that this comnuinication must be considered as a
rehearsal onlv of what he hoped would be done with more effect next year at Aberdeen,
when further observations might lead him either to confirm or modify that portion
of his views which relates to the age of the Elgin sandstones. In the mean time, the
fundamental reform of the North Scottish series is above narrated, proving that the
ascent from rocks on the west coast, whicli are unquestionably older than any in
England and Wales, through Cambrian and Lower Silurian rocks to the much
younger " Old Red Sandstone " of the east coast, is firmly established. The commu-

nicatfon was illustrated by several geological maps, to indicate the successive steps in
knowledo-e, including an old one coloured by himself tliirty-one years ago, the maps

of M'Culloch, Nicoi, and Knipe, and a map of Sutherland, which the author had

coloured during the simmier. Besides large diagrams, there were sketches of the

mountains and lochs of the west of Sutherland by Miss Charlotte Dempster.

On the Age and Relations of the Gneiss Rochs in the North of Scotland.

  By James Nicol, F.R.S.E., F. G.S., Professor of Natural History in the

    University of Aberdeen.

   The author expressed his regret that in one point he was compelled to differ from
his distinguished friend Sir R. I. Murcliison. He could not regard the entire gneiss

forming the central regions of Ross and Sutherland as of younger age than the red

sandstone and quartzite of the west coast (Cambrian and Silurian of Murcliison). He

described a section from the Gairloch to the Moray Frith, and showed that the red
sandstone and quartzite resting on the gneiss of the west, were cut oft' by a mass
of felspar-porphyry and serpentine from the supposed overlying rocks on the east.

He had traced a" band of similar igneous rocks at intervals for a hundred miles, from

Loch EriboU to Skye, and had observed other indications of i'racture and convulsion

alono- this line, as shown in the section exhibited. He therefore concluded that the

overlap of gneiss on quartzite might be occasioned by a slip or convolution of the

strata, and not mark the true order of superposition. He also stated, that the uncoii-

formabilitv of the quartzite to the red sandstone (Cambrian) which he had described
at Assynt and on Loch Broom, did not seem to occur in Gairloch, where the two
deposits, as seen in great sections on the escarpments of the mountains, appear quite
conformable ; the red sandstone, however, extending far beyond the quartzite on the

west. He further pointed out, that, in the central region of Scotland, from Aberdeen-

shire to Ar"-yllshire, the great formation of gneiss, with limestone and quartz rock,
overlies the mica slate, and does not dip under it, as usually represented. In parti-
cular, the gneiss of the Black Mount and Breadalbane Highlands appears to form a
wide synclinal trough resting on both sides on mica slate, and thus to be an overlying

and younger formation.

Ow t/ie Comparative Geology of Hotham, near South Cave, Yorkshire.
              By the Rev. T. W. Norwood, of Cheltenham.

The village of Ilotham is upon the lower lias ; but all the secondary rocks of this

part of Yorkshire, from the new red sandstone to the chalk inclusive, may be seen in

its immediate neighbourhood. Their course is nearly N.N.W. At Hotham proper

we are  only concerned with  the  lias  and  inferior  oolite                           to  them  therefore  these
                                                                                     ;

remarks are limited.
   I. Between North Cave and South Cliff the lower lias "limestones and shales" pre-

sent to the plain their usual elevated outcrop, and exhibit plentifully their charac-
teristic fossils Gryph(Ea incurva, Lima gigantea, Ostrea liassica, Modiola minima,

and many other familiar forms. The " Bone-bed" and " Insect-bed" appear to be
wanting. The lias passes conformably, and somewhat suddenly, into the sandy beds

below it.

  A great destruction lias happened to the lower lias in this locality. The north side

of North Cave is built on a thick drift of the Modiola minima bed, excessively crowded
with a doubtful sliell called provisionally a Posidonomya ; and between North and
South Cave, in " Sandy Lane," is an extraordinary drift of Grt/p/icea incurva. These
two drifts are remarkably independent of each other.

    If. There seems to be no facility for examining the upper beds of the lower lias,
though that formation is a mile across. The middle lias forms a beautiful bank on

the east side of Hotham Park, and sections can be seen near North Cave, in a marl-

--pit and a road-side cutting. The beds change upwards thus from blue shales at the

bottom, through brown shales and sand with irregular broken bands of nodular clay»
ironstone, to a hard rock-bed of the true marlstoiie 2 or 3 feet in thickness, which
again is capped at the top of the ascent by a very rubbishy ferruginous rock, the

lowest member of the ironsto7ie series. These ironstones contain a good many fossils
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but are most distinguished by Belemnites and Rhynchonella telraidra. Many fossils
also of the marlslone band have been found in drift between Hotham and Newbald,

In the same drift are shells of the upper lias and Oxford clay, though neither of
these rocks is yet known with certainty to exist in situ near Hotham.

   III. Between the middle lias and inferior oolite there is a remarkable thin band

of marly limestone, which is called at present the '^ Ligniferous marl." It has a very
freshwater appearance, and contains fragmentary remains of ferns and other land

plants. Its marine I'emains consist chiefly of two species of Urchins, with Pinnae,

Pectens, and Modioljje, each of a single species, and always in good preservation.

This band seems never to have been described before in any locality.

   IV. The oolite of "Hotham Quarry" appears to be inferior oolite, and a distant

equivalent of the " Roestone " of Cheltenham. It is strange that this bed should have
been said to be wholly restricted to the vicinity of the town of Cheltenham. Its fos-

sils, and more or less of its structure, may be seen in other places; as at Haresfield
in C'loucestershire, and at Hotham. At Hotham perhaps the most common form is

Pygaster semisulcatus ; which is at present supposed, on the best authority, to be
strictly confined to the inferior oolite. The fossils associated with it lead to the same

conclusion : they are most of them common at Cleeve and Crickley, near Cheltenham.

On a New Genus (Dimorphodon) of Pierodactyle, with remarks on the GeO'

Bylogical Distribution of Flying Reptiles.  Professor Owen, M.D,,

LL.D., F.R.S.

   The author exhibited a drawing of the skull and some of the wing-bones and other
limb-bones of a Pterodactyle which he had obtained during a recent visit to Lyme

Regis, in Dorsetshire. The specimen in question was discovered in the lower lias

of that locality, and had been purchased for the British Museum. The fore-part of

the cranium was preserved, anterior to the orbit, measuring in length 6 inches.

This was peculiar for the vast expanse of the long nostril, which was oval, and

measured 3 inches by \\ inch ; the antorbital vacuity, divided by a slender

oblique bar from the nostril, was triangular, 1 inch 5 lines in long diameter;

the solid part of the premaxillary in advance of the nostril measured only 1 inch

--9 lines in length, or little more than half the length of the nostril proportions

which had not been previously observed in any Pterodactyle. The largest teeth

were implanted in this part of the upper jaw. One, which had been displaced and

showed the oblique basal cavitj;^ and depression, formed by a successional tooth,

measured more than an inch in length. The largest exserted crown of a premaxil-

Alary tooth in place measured 7 lines.  tooth situated 3^ inches behind the first

tooth, had a crown 5 lines in length ; then followed three shorter teeth, and behind

these, and below the antorbital vacuity, were several small teeth, with intervals.

The dentary bones of the lower jaw were preserved, measuring G^ inches in length.

These exhibited a peculiarity of dentition not previously described or figured ; viz.

two long prehensile teeth at the fore-part of each ramus, separated by an interval of
half an inch, and followed, after a similar interval, by a series of much more minute
and close-set teeth, with straight, short, compressed, lancet-shaped crowns, none of
which exceeded a line in length. Forty-five of these teeth might be counted in aa

alveolar extent of 2 inches 9 lines, and in a part of the dentary bone averaging S lines

in depth. This character of dentition was such, that the figure published by Dr.

Buckland of the fragment of a jaw found in the same lias at Lyme Regis, with similar

minute serial teeth, " like one another, flat, and shaped at the point hke a lancet,"
and which he believed was " probably that of our Pterodactyle," was deemed by
most palaeontologists to have been rather a portion of the jaw of a fish. The Pie-
rodactylua Banihensis and Pterodactylus Gemmingi, distinguished by an edentulous

production (processus mentalis), from the fore-part of the jaw, had three or four large

teeth next behind that process, followed by several smaller teeth ; and these Ptero-

dactyles formed the genus Ramphorhynchus of V. Meyer : but the hind-teeth were

not nearly so numerous and minute as in the specimen from the lower lias, and this
had no edentulous " processus mentalis." So marked a difference from the dentition

of the species of the true Pterodactylus, represented by Ptei\ longirostris and Pter.
crassirostris, as well as from the mandibular and dental characters of the Rampho-

rhynchus of V. Meyer, appeared to call for the subgeneric separation of the Pter.

macronyx of Buckland from the later forms of Pterosauria : and Professor Owen pro-

posed the name Dimorphodon for this new subgenus, in reference to the two kinds

of teeth, or two features of dentition, one of them borrowed, as it were, from the

fish or batrachian, by this early form of flying dragon.' Among the bones associated

By this comparison it was shown that the second specimen was larger than the first,

but differed so slightly in the proportions of the first and second phalanges, as not,
in Professor Owen's opinion, to justify a distinction of species : more particularly
since, on the supposition of the portion of jaw figured by Dr. Buckland having be-
longed to the same individual as the limb-bones figured by the same author, the first

specimen of Pterodactylus macronyx had the same subgeneric character of mandibular

teeth as the second specimen from the same formation and locality.

   Some portions of thin-walled hollow bones from the upper beds of the Trias of
Wirtemberg might belong to the Pterodactyle genus ; in which case they would in-
dicate the oldest examples known of the flying order of reptiles. The oldest cer-
tainly known Pterodactyles were, at present, the Pterodactylus macronyx, Bd., of the
lower lias, forming the type of the subgenus Dimorphodon ; and bones of Pterodac-
tyle from the coeval lias in Wirtemberg. The next in point of age was the Pt. Ban-

ihensis, from the 'Posidonomyenschiefer' of Banz, in Bavaria, answering to the alum-
shale of our Whitby lias. Then follows the Pter. Biicklandi, from the Stonesfield

oolite. Above this came the first-defined and numerous species of Pterodactyle from

the lithographic slates of the Middle Oolitic system ; as at Solenhofen, Pappenheim,
and Nusplingen, in Germany, and from Cirin, on the Rhine. The Pterodactyles of

the Weaiden were, as yet, known by only a few bones and bone-fragments ; as had

hitherto been also those of the ' Greensand ' of Cambridgeshire. Finally, the Ptero-

dactyles of the Middle Chalk of Kent, so remarkable for their great size, constituted

the last forms of flying reptiles known in the history of the crust of this earth.

of fragmentary remains of Pterodactyles which had been discovered in the Upper
Greensand formations, now extensively worlced for phosphatic nodules, near Cam-

bridge.

   Among these were many more or less entire vertebr.-e demonstrating their pro-
ccelian type, as in modern Lizards ; the Pterodactyles being the earliest known ver-

tebrate animals with ' cup-and-ball' vertebra?, and with the ' cup ' at the fore-part of
the centrum. The atlas consists of a centrum, two slender styliform ncurapophyses,
and a neural spine, which is small and discoid. The centrum is a thin disc ; flat

where it joins, and becomes anchylosed to, the axis; concave for the occipital tubercle.
The ncurapophyses, resting on the upper part of the sides of the centrum of the atlas,

converge and articulate above with two tubercles on the fore-part of the neural arch
of the axis. The centrum of the axis is 8 lines longer than that of the atlas, which
was one line long in the specimen described. It expands posteriorly, where it ter-
minates, below, in a pair of short obtuse apophyses, above which is the convexity
for articulating with the third vertebra. At the middle of the under surface is a low

hypapophysial ridge. At the middle of the side of the centrum is the large pneu-

matic foramen. The neural arch is anchylosed with the centrum, and sends off
from each posterior angle the zj'gapophysis, which has a tubercle above and a flat
articular surface below looking downward, and a little outward and backward. The
neural canal expands at the posterior outlet. The neural spine is broken away.

   In the ordinary neck-vertebrfe the centrum is oblong and subdepressed, slightly

compressed at the middle, subcarinate at the fore-part of the under surface, the back
part of which expands and is slightly produced into a short thick obtuse process on

each side. The anterior concavity is a long transverse oval ; beneath which, in most,
is a tuberosity terminating there the median keel. The posterior ball has a similar

--transversely extended elliptical figure the characteristic of the neck-vertebrse of the

Pterodactyle, but tilted up by the curve of the under surface of the centrum, above

Athe level of the two terminal tuberous processes. large pneumatic foramen, of an

elliptic form, opens upon the middle of each side of the centrum close to the anchy-

losed base of the neurapophysis. The texture of the centrum presents a few very
large cancelli, which doubtless received the air from the cervical air-cells. The sur-

face of the centrum is formed by a very thin compact layer of bone, a little thicker

where it forms the articular cup.

The neural arch, between the notches for the nerve-outlets, is not quite two-thirds

the length of the centrum ; the hinder notch is the deepest ; the arch is low and
broad, less concave on each side than it is before and behind, with the four angles
rather produced, and supporting the articular surfaces, of which the two anterior
look upward and forward, the two posterior downward and backward. The sides of
the arch extend outward so as to overhang those of the centrum. The posterior

zygapophyses do not extend so far back as the articular ball of the centrum.

At the base of the neck, or beginning of the back, the vertebrte suddenly decrease

in length ; the hypapopliysis disappears, or is represented only by a slight production
of the lower border of the anterior cup ; the parapophyses are less produced, the

lower surface of the centrum is flattened, and presents a quadrate form. There is

now a considerable development from the fore-part of each side of the neural arch

and contiguous part of the centrum, and thereby the last cervical or first dorsal ver-

tebra of the Pterodactyle more resembles the corresponding vertebra of the bird.

The parapophysis, diapophysis, and rudimental rib coalesce around the vertebrarterial

foramen ; an oblique ridge is continued from the upper border of the anterior arti-

cular cup upon the parapophysis                                                                                                                                                     a parallel oblique ridge is continued from the an-
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

terior zygapophysis downward and outward upon the pleurapophysis ; the diapo-

physis makes a low obtuse projection above the pleurapophysis and behind the

zygapophysis. Above these developments the neural arch contracts from before

backward, to an extent of 5 lines, as compared with a total vertebral breadth, ante-

riorly, of 1 inch 8 lines ; it then rapidly expands, rising vertically at its fore part,
and developing at its back part the posterior zygapophyses, the articular facets of
which look more directly outward than in the long cervical vertebrae ; the superin-

cumbent tubercle is more distinct from the facet ; the posterior zygapophyses are
also much more approximated than in those vertebrae; they are separated behind
by a semicircular concavity; the base of the neural spine in the vertebra here

described measured 6 lines in length by 3 in breadth. The pneumatic foramina are at
the back part of the base of the diapophysis. The articular surfaces of the centium
retain the transversely extended form, and are simply concave before and convex
behind, which at once distinguishes the Pterosaurian hind-cervical vertebra from

that of the bird.
    In the dorsal region the vertebral centrum, retaining its shortness, gains in depth,

and presents the more usual proportions of cup-and-ball reptilian vertebrae. The
under surface is smooth and even, very slightly concave lengthvyise, convex trans-
versely. The parapophysis disappears, and the diapophysis, which alone supports

the rib, after the first or second dorsal, is sent off from a higher position in the

neural arch.

  --Sacrum. The Woodwardian Museum contains a specimen of the bodies of three

anchylosed sacral vertebra, the first being demonstrated by part of its anterior con-
cave articular surface for the last lumbar vertebra. The groove for the passage
of the nerve notches the back part of the parapophysis, close to the line of suture
with the second sacral. In this vertebra the corresponding nerve-notch is more
advanced, leaving a short sutural surface behind, indicative of a position of the neu-
ral arch crossing for a short extent the line of junction of the second with the third
sacral centrum. The parapophyses of the second and third vertebrae are sent off
almost on a level with the lower surface of the centrum, which is flattened.

    The fore-part of the sacrum of a much larger Pterodactyle, from the Cambridge

 Greensand, differing also in the less transverse convexity of the under part of the
first centrum, measures 1 1 lines across the shallow anterior articular concavity, and

 14 lines from the lower part of the centrum to the fore-part of the base of the neural
spine. The neural canal is circular and 2 lines in diameter ; above it the neural arch
 rises like a vertical wall for 5 lines, where the spine has been broken off.

  --Caudal VoriebrcB. From the number of elongated caudal vertebrae in the series of
--fossils from the Cambridge Greensand submitted to the author not fewer than
--seven he believes the large Pterodactyle from that formation to have had a long

tail, but moveable, not stiff through anchylosis of the vertebra;, as in Pier. {Rampho-

 rhynchus) Gemmingi, V. Meyer.

    PTERODA.CTYLUS Sedgwickii, Owen.--This species is founded on a specimen

 of the fore-part of the upper jaw, containing the first seven sockets of the teeth, in a
 few of the anterior of which the base of the tooth is retained. The first two sockets
 open upon the obtuse extremity of the jaw, and have a direction showing that their
 teeth projected obliquely forward, so as to prolong the prehensile reach of the jaw

 the second and third sockets are the largest, and cause a slight transverse swelling;
 the fourth is suddenly smaller, and the three following retain nearly the same size,
 or show a slight increase as they pass backward. The apertures of the sockets are
 elliptic, with the long axis extending obliquely from before outward and backward,
 not parallel with the axis of the jaw. The interval between the two sockets is about
 half the long diameter of each. The anterior termination of the jaw is obtuse ; the
 sides are smooth, flat, converging at an acute angle to what almost forms a ridge

 above ; the jaw gradually increases in vertical diameter as it proceeds backward,
 the upper contour being straight as far as it can be traced in the fossil. The palatal
 surface is entire, narrowest between the second sockets, suddenly broader and flat

 between the third pair, retaining about the same breadth, but with a slight convexity

 and feeble indication of a median ridge in the rest of its extent.
    The Pterosaurian nature of this fossil is shown by the extreme thinness of the

 compact bonv wall of the jaw ; its relation to the genus Pterodactylus, as contra-

 distinguished from the Rhamphorhynchus, V. Meyer, is proved by the terminal posi-

 tion of the sockets ; and sufficient of the outer side-wall of the jaw is preserved to

--show that the nostril did not advance so far forward as in Dimorphodon the generic

 form of Pterodactyle from the lower lias.

    By its size and true or proper pterodactyle affinities, the present specimen most

--resembles Pterodactylus Cuvieri, Owen, from the Chalk of Kent ; but it offers the

 following well-marked differences a greater proportional size of the anterior sockets

 with a corresponding expansion of the fore-part of the jaw ; a greater number and

 closer arrangement of the sockets ; a greater depth of the jaw, in proportion to the

 breadth of the palate. The extent of the jaw, e. g., containing the first seven sockets

in Pterodactylus Sedgwickii, is 2 inches 9 lines, but in Pferodacfylus Cuvieri it is 3

inches 6 lines ; the depth of the jaw, above the third socket, in Pier. SedyuncJcii is
14 lines, in Pter. Cuvieri it is 8 lines ; whilst the breadth of the palate between

the third pair of sockets is only one line less in Pter. Cuvieri than in Pter. Sedgwickii.

It needs only to compare the fore-part of the jaw of the great Chalk Pterodactyle with

the same part of the still larger species from the Greensand, to be convinced of their

specific distinction.

The difference is still more marked between Pterodactylus Sedgwickii and the

Pterodactylus compressirostris, Ow., from the Chalk. The rapid increase of depth as

the jaw extends backward, in Pter. giganteus, Bk., shows that that comparatively

small species cannot be the young of the present truly gigantic Pterodactyle of the

Upper Greensand. The author, therefore, has founded, on the above-described fossil,

a new species, at present the largest known in the order of Flying Saurians, which

he proposes to dedicate to the Woodwardian Professor of Geology in the University
of Cambridge, who for forty years has discharged the duties of that office with

exemplary zeal and a rare eloquence, has almost created the Museum still called

Woodwardian, and, during the same period, has enriched geological science by origi-

nal researches which have thrown light on its most obscure and difficult problems.

 --Pterodactylus Fittoni, Owen. This species is also founded on the fore-part

of the upper jaw of a Pterodactyle, M'ith the first and second pairs of alveoli. In the

minor depth of the jaw compared with its basal breadth, in its more obtusely rounded
upper surface, and in the greater extent of sjiace between the alveoli of the same size,

this maxillary fragment indicates a very distinct species from the Pterodactylus Sedg-

tvickii, but one probably not much inferior in size. The author dedicates it to his

friend Dr. Fitton, F.R.S., one of the Founders of the Geological Society of London,

and who may be regarded as the discoverer of the system now called 'Neocoraian,'

which includes the Greensand matrix of the Flying Reptiles under consideration.

   The sockets in the present fragment may answer to the second and third in the

foregoing, though there scarcely seems room for a pair in advance of the foremost in

the present specimen ; be that as it may, the distance between the first and second
socket in the specimen of Pterodactylus Fittoni is, relatively to the size of the socket,

greater than the interval between the second and third sockets in Pterodactylus Sedg-

wickii, and much greater than that between the second and third sockets. The outer

wall of the largest anterior socket in Pter. Fifto7ii is much less prominent than in Pter.

Sedgwickii, and the lateral expansion of the fore-part of the upper jaw must have

been relatively less : the form of the bony palate is different, there being a distinct
though shallow longitudinal groove on each side a low obtuse median ridge. The

diastema between the second and third tooth is shown to exceed the long diameter

of the second socket, recalling the proportion of the interspaces in Pterodactylus

--Cuvieri ; but the jaw is broader in proportion to its height in Pterodactylus Fittoni.
   Pterodactylus, sp. inc. This is represented by a portion of an upper jaw

including a part of two sockets, in one of which the root of the tooth remains.
The outer wall of the jaw is nearly flat, very slightly convex below, and as slightly

concave above, vertically ; the upper margin showing no indication of any bend or
inclination to the upper border of the jaw, the height or vertical diameter of which

remains conjectural : that it was, at least, one-third more than the portion preserved,

may be estimated from the extent of the socket of the tooth being equal Avith the

Apreserved part of the wall.  coat of roughish cement, one-third of a line thick, is

preserved upon the upper half of the tooth-root ; below this is seen the smooth

dentine ; and, where it is broken, the pulp-cavity is exposed, filled by the greensand

matrix. The length of the implanted part of this tooth is 1 inch 4 lines ; the long

diameter of the transverse fracture at the base of the crown is 3 an inch, the short

diameter is 4^j lines. Estimating the length of the exserted enamelled crown to equal

--that of the inserted cemented base of the tooth of a Pterodactyle, and it is sometimes
--greater in the long anterior laniariform teeth, we may assign a length of 2 inches 8

lines to the teeth implanted in the part of the upper jaw here described. The interspace

between the two sockets is 3^ lines, or half that of the long diameter of the socket

the plane of the opening of the socket, and the interspace, present the same obliquity

as they do in Pterodactylus  Sedgwickii                                                   and, as  the  proportion of the  interspace to
                                                                                       ;

the socket is also the same, the present fragment has most probably belonged to a
--102 REPORT 1858.

larger individual of the same species. Since the outer border of the sockets does not
swell out beyond the outer wall of the jaw, the fragment has been part of the jaw
 situated behind the anterior swelling caused by the proportionally large prehensile
teeth; and as, from the analogy of known Pterodactyles, the teeth succeeding those
 anterior ones are not of larger size, but are usually smaller, at any posterior part of the
jaw, we may therefore, with due moderation, frame an idea of the Pterodactyle to
 which the present maxillary fragment belonged, as surpassing in size that to which the
portion of the jaw of Pter. Sedgwickii belonged, in the proportion in which the socket
in the present exceeds the last socket in that fragment. Such an idea impels to a

 close scrutiny of every character or indication of the true generic relation of the pre-
 sent fragment in the reptilian class : but the evidence of the large and obviously pneu-

matic vacuities, now filled by the matrix, and the demonstrable thin layer of compact

 bone forming their outer wall, permit no reasonable doubt as to the pterosaurian
 nature of this most remarkable and suggestive fossil.

    All other parts of the flying reptile being in proportion, it must have appeared,
with outstretched pinions, like the soaring Roc of Arabian romance, but with the
demoniacal features of the leathern wings with crooked claws, and of the gaping
mouth with threatening teeth, superinduced.

  --Teeth of the large Pterodactyle. Various teeth, but few quite entire, have been

rescued by the care and perseverance of Mr. Lucas Barrett, from the rubbish of frag-
mentary fossils accumulated during the diggings for phosphatic nodules in the
Grecnsand deposits near Cambridge. Guided by the proportions of length to breadth,
by the elliptic section, and the concordance of the minute markings on the crown
and base with those on the portions of teeth remaining in the above-described jaws

of Pterodacfylus, many of the above- detached teeth can be satisfactorily referred to

that genus.

    The base or implanted part of one of the largest of these leeth has belonged to a
Pterodactyle as large as that represented by the fragment of jaw last described ; it
presents the same elliptical transverse section as the implanted base of the tooth in
that fragment, show^s a widely excavated pulp-cavity at the base, and gradually tapers
to the crown : the cement, about ^rd of a line in thickness, is roughened by longi-
tudinal grooves, not continuous for any great length, but uniting, or bifurcating, in an
irregular reticulate pattern, forming long and very narrow meshes, the raised inter-
spaces being equal in breadth to the grooves. In a few teeth the base shows an
oblique depression, evidently due to the pressure of a succcssional tooth ; in these
the basal pulp-cavity is more or less filled up by ossification of the pulp. The
enamel of the crown seems smooth and polished ; and, under the lens, shows only
extremely delicate, slightly and irregularly wavy, longitudinal, but often interrupted

or confluent ridges.

    Portions of the scapular arch, the humerus, antibrachial and carpal bones were
next described. The distal end of the metacarpal of the fifth or winged finger is
trochlear ; but the pulley is more complex than in other animals with similar joints,
there being three convex ridges traversing the articular surface from behind forward,
and describing more than half a circle ; the middle ridge less produced than the
lateral ones which form the sides of the pulley. The direction of the ridges is rather
oblique. The outer ridge is rather more produced and of a less regular curve than
the inner ridge. The outer ridge begins by a rising at the middle of the fore- part of
the distal end of the shaft, which bends obliquely outward and meets the outer angle
of that part of the shaft where the outer trochlear ridge begins to be prominent ; this
ridge then extends with a feeble convex curve to the back part of the trochlea, where
the convexity of the curve increases, and it terminates by projecting a little beyond
the level of the outer almost flattened side of the trochlea. The articular surface, as
it extends from the margin of this element of the trochlea inward, is first gently
convex, then sinks to a concave channel by the side of the low median convexity.
The inner ridge begins from the inner side of the fore-part of the bone, and describes
a pretty regular semicircular curve as it extends backward and a little outward, to
terminate near the middle of the back part of the distal end of the shaft ; thus, owing
their obliquity to a termination of the inner ridge near the middle of the back part,
and to the beginning of the outer ridge near the middle of the fore part, of the meta-
carpal bone, these priacipal ridges of the trochlear joint recede from each other at
                          --

the middle of the joint, and approximate at the fore and back ends of the joint. As
the back ends of the two lateral ridges are on the same transverse Hne, and the front
end of the inner ridge rises higher upon the shaft than that of the outer ridge, this
is by so much the shorter of the two. The low middle ridge is much shorter than
either of the lateral ones, being confined to the lower and middle part of the trochlea,

to which it gives an undulating transverse outline.
   The portions of the wing-bones of the Pterodactyles of the Cambridge Greensand,

here described and figured, show the same superior proportions over those of the
great Pterodactyles from the Kentish Chalk, as do the portions of jaw-bones and

teeth.

   The long diameter of the expanded end of the largest of the wing-bones of a
Pterodactyle from the Cambridge Greensand is 3 inches.

   The transverse diameter of the distal end of the humerus of the Pterodaclylus
grandis, Cuv., the largest species hitherto obtained from the Lithographic Slates of
German}', is 1 inch 3 lines ; neither the radius, ulna, nor metacarpal of the wing-bone
of the same species presents a diameter of its largest end equalling 1 inch.

   The articular end of the long wing-bone, 3 inches thick, being most probably that
of an antibrachial bone, and the total length of the bone, whether radius or ulna,

being, according to the proportions of either of these bones in the Pterodaclylus
suevicHS, 16 inches, the following would be the length of the other large bones of the
wing in the large Pterodactyle to which the above-cited specimen belonged, according
to the proportions which the other wing- bones bear to the radius or ulna in the

Pterodaclylus sucvicus :

   Supposing the breadth of the Pterodactyle between the two shoulder-joints to be
8 inches, and allowing 2 inches for the carpus and the cartilages of the joints of the

different bones in each wing, we may then calculate that a large Pterodaclylus

SedgwicJcii would be upborne on an expanse of wings of not less than 22 feet from

tip to tip.

   The author looks forward with confidence to future acquisitions of remains of the
truly gigantic Pferodactyhis of the cretaceous periods, more especially from the
Greensand locality near Cambridge, as a means of throwing more Ught on the pecu-

liar osteology of the extinct flying reptiles.

containTng bones of the whale, and several shells of boreal species; the third and
fourth rarely containing remains, and the fourth bones of whales and the skeleton

now in question. The clay in which the skeleton was imbedded is a bright red plastic
clay, evidently derived from the waste of the Old Red Sandstone of Upper Stratheden,
when the waves washed the bases of the present hills, and the streams brought down
from the Lower Ochils the debris of the same formation. It contains no boulders or

pebbles, and appears to have been a tranquil deposit in water of considerable depth
and removed from the influence of drift, either vegetable or animal, from the adjacent
shores. It rests on the true boulder clay, which is there a dark blue tenacious mass
of great thickness, and replete with boulders of granite, syenite, greenstone, gneiss,

--quartz, and other primary formations. Tlie descending section shows arable soil

and sandy clay 3 feet; laminated sand 1 foot; from 15 to 20 feet of red plastic clay,
in which the skeleton was imbedded at a depth of 12 feet-- the whole being under-
laid by blue boulder clay of unknown depth. From the position of the red clay,
and the disposition of the associated gravel mounds, it is evident that it is younger
than the boulder bed on which it rests, and that it is as old at least as the 150-feet
beach, and greatly older than the silts and gravels which in the Forth, Clyde, and
Tay have yielded remains of whales, antlers of gigantic red deer, skulls of the Bos

longifrons, wolf, bear, and heaver, and shells, many of which are of boreal species.

How much younger than the boulder clay we have no direct means of determining,

though evidently much older than the human occupation of Britain, which must have
then been sunk to a depth of from 150 to 200 feet below its present level. As regards
the skeleton itself (which is that of a young animal, and in a wonderful state of pre-
servation), it seems to be a pretty widely divergent variety of the common seal

 [Phoca viiuUna), if not a distinct species ; a point, however, that yet awaits the precise
 determinations of the comparative anatomist. If the same as the existing seal, then
 it invests that creature with a high degree of antiquity ; if of a difl'erent species

(boreal or more southerly), then it shows the high age of these brick- clays, and may

 assist to identify their position in other localities.

     Farther Contributions to the Palceontology of the Tilestones or Silurio-

             Devonian Strata of Scotland. By D. Page, F.G.S.

     Without enterino- on the stratigraphical relations of these tilestones (which would
 be discussed at a subsequent meeting;), he might simply mention, that part of them, as
 in Lanarkshire, seemed to cap and form portion of the Upper Silurians, while the
 larger portion, the Forfarshire flagstones, undoubtedly constituted the basis of the Old

 Red Sandstone ; hence, with a view to avoid all discussion in the mean time, he had

 ranked the whole as " Silurio-Devonian," or " Pterygotan Beds." Beginning with
 the Lanarkshire beds, he had, since the Glasgow meeting, been enabled to add several

 new forms to the fossil Fauna of that district, for as yet no trace of vegetation had

 been detected in these strata. In addition to Troclius helinites and Lbigula cornea,
 which were then known, he had now to add Pteriiiea, Orthonota, Nticula, Avicula,
 Orthoceras, and other well-marked Ludlow or Upper Silurian shells. To the Crusta-

 ceans then known, viz. Bei/richia, Ceratiocaris, and Himanthopteriis, he had now to
 add several discoveries which rendered the structure of these curious crustaceans more
 apparent, besides the detection of two entirely new forms, which he would venture to

 term provisionally Stylonurus spinipes and 6'. clavipes, in allusion to their jiointed style-
 shaped caudal termination, and to the characteristic form of their swimming paddles,
 or third pair of organs which spring from the under side of their cephalo-thorax.

obscure vegetable forms, Parka decipiens of Lyell, PLerygotus, and Cephalaspk, lie
was now enabled to add several new and gigantic forms of Fucoids, a Cyclopteris, and
a Lepidodendroid stem, which was clearly of terrestrial origin. To the Fauna he lias
added gigantic Foralites and Scolites, or annelid burrows and annelid tracks, and an
organism which appeared to be the remains of an annelid itself. There had also been
discovered several new portions of Plerycjotus, which rendered the true structure of
that gigantic crustacean much more apparent ; and he had also been enabled to de-
scribe and figure two new crustaceans under the names of Kampecaris and Stylomtrus,
the latter closely related in structure to Eurypterus, and approaching the forms of
those found in the Lanarksliire strata. To Cephalaspls, of which little more was
known than the head and bony ring-plates of tlie body, he had now to add a well-
marked corneous eye-capsule, a pair of pectoral tins (or rather swimming paddles), a

--subdorsal fin, and tlie true form of the large heterocercal tail ; so that, instead of

figuring this much-caricatured fish as had hitherto been the case, as a saddler's knife
for the head, and a parsnip with a few radicles for the body, we could now restore it

as a legitimate and elegant iish, much resembling in general contour the armed bull-

head or Aspidophorus of our present shores. 1'here had also been discovered a vast
number of fin-spines or Ichthyodorulites, which were yet undescribed; and a small
fish with nn spines and shagreen-like scales, to whicli he had given the name of Icli-

nocephalus granidatus, in allusion to its kite-shaped head and shagreen -covered body.
For the discovery and preservation of these new fossil forms, pakeontologists were
mainly indebted to James Powrie, Esq., of lleswallie, Forfar, and to Mr, Simon, sur-

geon, Lismahagow.

On the Relations of the Metamorphic and Older Palceozoic Rocks in Scot-
                         land. By D. Page, F.G.S.

   As was well known, a large development of Silurian strata occurred in the south of
Scotland, dipping northward under the Okl Red Sandstone, which in turn underlaid
the coal-fields of tlie Forth and Clyde. On the northern side of the coal-basin, the

Old Red dipped  southward, again  underlying  the  coal-measures                                                                   but  between  the

Old Red and the Grampians, no true representative of tlie Silurian system had as yet

been detected. What, then, were the relations of these rocks? He had made many

sections during the last two summers, and found that everywhere, from Stonehaven

on the east to Bute on the west, a thick mass of trappean conglomerate succeeded the

crystalline schists, that this was succeeded by the fissile grey strata of Perth and
Forfar, containing Pterygotus and Cephalaspis, these by the " Great Pebbly Conglo-

merate," and then the middle Old Red with Holoplychhts, and the upper yellow
beds with Holoptycldus and Ptcrichthys. The Pterygotan beds, though evidently

approaching the upper Silurians of Lanarkshire in fossil characters, were still the

basis of the Old Red ; and if Silurian strata did exist on the southern slopes of the

Grampians, geologists must seek for them eitlier in the trap conglomerate and grits

below, or in the clay-slates and mica-schists which might be the metamorphosed

equivalents of the Silurians of Peebles, Roxburgh, and Dumfriesshire. Two con-

clusions thus presented themselves : either the physical geography of the north had

been such during the Silurian era, as not to admit the deposition of strata ; or having

been deposited, as in the south, they had been subsequently metamorphosed and all

traces of organic life been obliterated in their crystalline structure. Whichever view

might be adopted, we had in the mean time no fossil evidence of Silurian strata on

the southern flanks of the Grampians, though in the south of Scotland, and on the

south side of the great basin of the Clyde and Forth, a vast development of lower,

middle and upper Silurians had been traced and pretty closely examined. Grouping,

therefore, the older rocks of Scotland according to the present state of our inform-

ation, we had something like the following succession :

 Notice of some Phenomena at the Junction of the Granite and Schistose

  Rocks in West Cumberland. By Professor Phillips, LL.D., F.R.S.

  --The author referred in the first place to some excellent observations the only ones

--he had met with of Professor Sedgwick on the little visited region of slate and gra-

nite in the extreme south-west of Cumberland. Following in his steps, Prof. Phillips
had found an extremely interesting variety of ])henomena, from which a few were
selected for the present communication, and illustrated by maps and sections.

   He described three orders of plienomena, all due to some form of heat action,

observed by himself in the slate district of Black Comb, and on tlie north-west
border of that mountain. In tlie mountain of Black Comb, the black slates, much

contorted, are not in a mctamorphic state. Several dykes or interposed bands

of granite (elvan) lie in the slates of the north-western part of Black Comb ; they
very slightly affect the condition of the slates. Round a considerable part of Black

Comb the green slate series is metamorphic, and the series of changes is such, that
from unaltered slate at one end, new structures appear and auguient (not ver}' regu-

larly), so as at the other end to complete a green or black porphyry. Agate con-

cretions appear in some places in long pipes parallel to cleavage dip. Tliis remark-
able series of changes is traced with great precision in a bold narrow ridge of rock
near Bootle, one end of which almost touches the black slate, the other is met by a
tongue of granite. Near the junction the granite is hornblendic (syenite) ; it enters
the metamorphic series in veins of fissure, and produces on that series further small
changes of colour and texture apparently proportioned to the mass of the introduced

rock. Thus in one district, possibly due to one general cause, the eartli's internal
heat, but operating through long time, under different conditions, three distinct orders
of phenomena appear, for each of which a special investigation is necessary, and to

which, when fully understood, a special explanation may be applied.

     On the Hcematite Ores of North Lancashire and West Cumberland.
    By Professor Phillips, LL.D., F.R.S., and Mr. R. Barkeu, Jun.

   Prof. Phillips embodied in his remarks on the iron-ores of North Lancashire, the

substance of a communication from Mr. R. Baker, jun., ' On the Haematite Dcjiosits

of West Cumberland.' The districts of North Lancashire and VVest Cumberland, to
which reference was made, were rich in deposits of peroxidated iron ore, and were
now producing, probably, not less than one million of tons per annum. Notwith-
standing their value, they had not been carefully examined until a recent period, but
some interesting geological phenomena had now been observed, which threw consider-
able light on the age of the iron-ore formations of West Cumberland and North Lan-
cashire. The iron ore of these districts was found in immediate connexion with
                               ;

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  107

mountain limestones, and many persons had been in the habit of regarding the ore as

of the same age as tlie mountain limestone, and as being part of the limestone series
but a careful observation of the district of Morth Lancashire would go far to remove
this opinion. Running acioss the mountain limestone of that district were vast and
often devious hollows, and it was in these hollows that the ore is found, lying upon
the limestone, and resting on one side against what was evidently a great line of fault,

as well as in the lissnresand hollows of the rock, with all the indications of a later

deposit. The comnuinication of Mr. Baker showed by very exact sections and de-
scriptions, that iron ore was not confined to limestone, but was also to be found in con-

nexion with the adjacent slate formations, showing that it was not a deposit peculiar to
the limestone. The opinion which Professor Phillips had formed on this subject he by

no means wished to be accepted as a positive conclusion ; but the position of the ore,
upon the faults of the limestone as well as in the fissures and hollows of the rock, went
to prove that it was a subsequent formation. The date to which it could with most pro-

bability be referred was that of some parts of the Permian deposits. He v/as inclined

to believe that the lines of faults and fissures, and the sinuous hollows, sometimes
cavernous, in the limestone, which had been excavated or modified by water, were
due to the action of causes which preceded the period of the Permian system, and
that the iron formation might generally be referred to the age of the Permian rocks,

and occasionally to a still later date, namely, that of the New Red Sandstone. He

was satisfied that the iron ore of Lancashire and Cumberland could not with proba-

bility be referred to the period of the mountain limestone.

 On a New Metliod of determining the Temperature and Pressure at which
   various Rocks and Minerals were formed. By H. C. Souby, F.Tt.S.

   If a tube be filled with air at any particular temperature and pressure, and be after-
wards taken to a place where the temperatm-e or pressure is different, the change in
the volume of the air would enable us to calculate the difference in the temperature,
if the difference in pressure were known, or to ascertain the difference in the press-
ure, if the difference in the temperature were known. Where crystals are artificially

formed from solution in water, they catch up and hermetically enclose in their solid
substance small quantities of that liquid, so as to produce fluid-cavities, which, from

the nature of the circumstances under which they originate, are just full of the liquid

at the temperature and pressure at which they are formed. This fluid is also affected
by changes in temperature and pressui-e, only that of course the actual amount of the
change of dimensions and the laws connecting it with the temperature and pressure
are not the same as in the case of air. M, then, a crystal be formed at an elevated
temperature, but under no very great pressure, when it cools down to the ordinary

heat of the atmosphere, the fluid in these cavities contracts, so as to leave a vacuity,
the relative size of which must of course depend upon the height of the original
temperature. Such fluid- cavities are easily seen with a suitable magnifying power,

and ihe relative size of the vacuity can be measured by means of the micrometer.
Applying these principles to the study of natural crystals, it is found that, whilst some
indicate a temperature not materially higher than that of the atmosphere, many must
have been formed at a heat rising upwards to that of dull redness, which is especially
the case with igneous and metamorphic rocks. If, however, the crystals were formed
luider a very great pressure, of course the above conclusions would be invalidated,
and the calculated temperature woidd be too low ; but if we could form some approxi-
mation to the actual temperature, we could deduce, from the relative size of the
vacuities in the fluid-cavities, the pressure under which the crystals were generated.
Where the fluid-cavities in granite rocks are studied in this manner, they lead us to
conclude that such rocks were formed under a very great pressure, varying in different

cases, but of such a magnitude, as clearly points to their deep-seated, plutonic origin.

    On some Peciiliarliles in the Arrangement of the Minerals in Igneous

                       Rocks. By H. C. Sorby, F.R.S.

   In both recent and ancient igneous rocks, it is not at all unusual to find crystals of
a mineral that fuses at only a moderately high tem^jerature, acting as the nuclei on
--108 REPORT 1858.

which crystals of a far less fusible mineral have been formed. Thus, for instance, in
the lava of Vesuvius crystals of leucite have very often been deposited on nuclei of
augite. If it were supposed that the temperature at which the minerals crystallized
was the same as that of their own fusing-point when heated alone, this would appear
to be a very unintelligible circumstance, but can easily be explained by supposing
that the fused rock is simply a liquid melting at a high temperature, which is capable
of dissolving various minerals, in the same manner tJiat the very fusible liquid water
dissolves various salts. If a solution of bichromate of potash, nearly saturated at the
freezing-point of water, be slowly frozen, small crystals of ice are formed, and on
these are deposited small crystals of bichromate of potash, which can no longer be held
in solution in the diminished quantity of liquid water. Here then, as in the above-

named instance of the arrangement of tlie crystals in lava, crystals of a very fusible
substance act as the nuclei on which far less fusible crystals are deposited; and if

--we suppose that there is a perfect analogy between the two cases, that both were
--liquids holding various substances in solution, the arrangement of the minerals in the

igneous rock no longer presents any special or exceptional peculiarit}'.

On the Currents present during the Depositio?i of the Carboniferous and
  Permian Strata in South Yorhshire and North Derbyshire. By H. C.

   SORBY, F.R.S.

This was a continuation of a branch of geology on which the author has published

several papers, pointing out how tlie direction and cliaracters of the currents present

during the deposition of stratified rocks can be determined (Report, 1855, p. 97).

The neighbourhood of Sheffield is extremely well fitted for this inquiry; and fromre-

siding there the author has been able to examine minutely a large tract of country,

and lay down the direction of the current in many hundred localities on large maj)s,

which were exhibited. The chief conclusions derived from these are, that during the

period of the millstone-grit there was a very uniform general current from the north-

east, slightly interfered with by a tide setting from the north-west, and by the action

of surface-waves and wind-drift currents produced by the powerful westerly gales.

This general north-east current was also present during the deposition of the gritstone

beds in the lower part of the coal strata, in the shales associated with which genuine

marine shells are found, but ceased towai'ds tlie central portion, more productive in

coal, where such marine shells do not occur. In that part of the series, in dificrent

localities and beds,  the  currents were  from  all  parts  of the  compass                                          but  on  the whole
                                                                                                                  ;

are chiefly from the west, as if in some way or other connected with the prevailing

westerly winds and wind-drift currents, which liere prevailed independent of the tide

or general north-east current, on account of the connexion with the main sea having

been cut off. During the deposition of the magnesian limestone the sea appears to

have been subject to a very decided tide, rising and falling with great uniformity from

W.S.W. to E.N.E., amongst a number of shoals on which surface-waves stranded,

chiefly produced by easterly winds. The millstone-grit and lower coal-measures

therefore present us with an admirable example of the action of a simple current,

flowing only in one direction ; whereas the magnesian limestone is a very excellent

illustration of the effect of oscillating currents moving backward and forward in a

particular line, like the currents produced by the rise and fall of the tide.

   The author referred to the erroneous impressions which generally prevail with re-
gard to the size, number and character of the Scilly group, which he described as
presenting many features of interest independently of their curious geologic pheno-
mena. It consists of a cluster of small islands or rocks 145 in mnnber, varying in
size from the mere solitary crag jutting out at low water from the surface of the ocean,
to the Isle of St. Mary, which is the largest, the most populous, and the most fertile
of the whole, measuring about 3 miles by 2h, and containing an estimated area of
about 1640 acres. They lie in latitude 49° 57' N., and in longitude 6° 43' W., bear-

distance from Penzance Pier (the usual starting-place for vessels from the main land)

is about 40 miles to St. Mary's Pool. So far from being mere rugged rocks, these

islands afford a pleasant home to between 2000 and 3000 inhabitants ; the total popu-

lation iiaving been computed in 1851 at 2601 souls, the majority of whom dwell upon

St. Mary's, though five of the other islands, viz. Tresco, St. Martin's, St. Agnes,

Bryher, and Sampson, have a scattered population upon them nearly in proportion to

their relative size. As the character of the rocks (being almost exclusively granitic)

is very similar to that of the extreme promontory of Cornwall, it has been suggested

by some writers that they may have been originally united with the main land; and

traditions are not wanting of a very ancient date which might serve to confirm this

opinion, were there not many countervailing reasons to be alleged in opposition.
From the circumstance that the Gulf or Woolf Rock, which lies midway between

Scilly and Land's End, is of greenstone and not of granite, and that in dredging the

sea-bottom between these two points, shells and sea-weeds have been occasionally

brought up clinging to (jreenstone or clay-slate, it is conceived that a tract of metamor-

pliic rocks exists beneath the ocean between the mainland and the Scilly Isles, and

that they are thus outliers only of the great granitic range of Devonshire and Corn-

wall. Many circumstances tend to prove that the conformation of the islands is very

difierent now from what it has been even within historic times. Local tradition

asserts that in former days there was a narrow causeway by which persons could

pass across Crow Sound from St. Mary's to St. Martin's, and the ledge of rock which
is visible at low water a little below the surface in this part is still called " the

Pavement." Then again the Gugh, which in the time of I3orlase (about 100 years

ago) is described as " a part of Agnes and never divided from it but by high and

boisterous tides," is now always an island at spring tides, and there is sufficient depth

of water in the mid-channel for a boat to shoot across, the bar. These considera-

tions would seem to show that there has been a decided sinking of the land in these

islands, even during the last century ; and another fact which came to the author's
knowledge while sojourning for a few weeks in the isles confirms this opinion. The

masons who had been engaged in laying the foundations of a large warehouse be-

longing to Mr. Edwards, a short distance from the Strand, in the Pool of St.

Mary's, when they had dug down several feet below the surface, came across the

remains of former wooden buildings, which at one period must have been on a level

with, if not above the sea, although at that time considerably below it. Possibly at

no very remote period, geologically speaking, the whole of this group to the north,

including Brvher, Tresco, St. Martin's, and the adjoining islets, have formed one con-

tinuous island, as the soundings even now between the contiguous portions are very

shallow, and several of them can be reached from the others by walking over the

bars at low water. With reference to the question of continuity at any former period

with the mainland, Mr. Statham gave some curious particulars of the tradition re-

specting a tract of country called the "Lionesse," formerly alleged to have united

Scilly with Cornwall, and referred to the junction of the slate with the granite at

Marazion Bay, and also at a point immediately behind Penzance Pier. He had made

diligent search throughout several of the islands to try and discover any traces of a

similar collocation of rocks in Scilly ; and although he had not found sufficient to

warrant him in asserting the fact of a former continuity, he had met with immis-

takeable proofs of the existence of clay-slate both on the Garrison Hill and on the

top of Newford Down which served to show that the Scillian group was more closely
                                                                                                                     ;

allied in the structure of its rocks to the formations on the mainland than had pre-

viously been supposed. The position in which the traces of slate rock were found

were in a pit to the right of the path leading from the Star Fort on the Hugh, to the

two  dismantled  windmills  on     the     summit  of  the  Down                                and  similar indications had
                                                                                             ;

presented themselves in a pit not far from the telegraph station at the summit of

iNewford Down.

    'i'he author next adverted to the different aspect of the islands as visited from the

SW. or theN., where they are subjected to the wear and tear of the rough Atlantic

»-.aves, and to their smooth and rounded appearance when approached from the main-

Hand. To the violence of the ocean, lashed into fury by the wintry gales, he attributed

the craggy and rugged appearance of the rocks, the existence of caverns, and of pro-
110 REPORT 1858.

inent headlands in these directions ; and he gave a singular exempliiication of the

power of water so agitated to alter the face of things by adverting to the fact, that in

the Greater Crebawethan large boulders of granite, from half a ton to two tons in

weight, have been lifted bodily out of the sea, and have been lodged in large heaps, as

though the ballast of a dozen vessels had been piled upon the top of the island, pro-
bably 18 or more feet above the surface of the ocean at the highest spring tides. As

the geologic features of St. Mary's seemed to be reproduced on a smaller scale in the

other islaiids, the author next proceeded to give a detailed account of its most im-

-- Aportant characteristics. The various soils superimposed upon the granite in this
island he described as the following : 1.  black surface soil composed of decayed

ve'^etable matter, and in many places largely intermixed with sand, either blown up

from the adjoining beach, or derived from intermixture with the underlying stratum.

A2. fine white ash-coloured sand, in some places (as in the pit just below the Na-
tional Schools) containing fragments of shells imbedded in it. o. A dark reddish

or chocolate-brown clay, in many parts of considerable thickness, and having angular

Ablocks of half-decomposed granite disseminated through it. 4. stratum of loose

grit or rubbly granite locally called " ram," sometimes so comminuted as to look at

a short distance otf like -a bed of cream-coloured lime or sandstone, but more fre-

quently coarse, and in the portions resting upon the granite mingled with large frag-

mentary masses of that rock; and fipially, in the low and marshy ground, as at Holy

Vale, and in the neighbourhood of Carnfriars, traces of a band of whitish pipeclay,

the position of which ought most probably to be placed above the last-named deposit.

The best locality for seeing at one view these various beds is a pit immediately below
Mount Flagon, on the bridle-path leading towards Porthloo Bay. The beds here

seen are numbered 1 to 5, downward. Between Nos. 3 and 4 the road-path inter-
venes, and No. 5 constitutes the low cliffs at this part of Fermellin Bay. The
stratum No. 2 seems to take its rise a little beyond Carn Morval Point, where it can
be seen capping the cliff, which is here much higher, and running along the line of
coast. It gradually thickens as it approaches St. Mary's Bay, where it assumes the

greatest depth, forming in the neighbourhood of the National School, and in a section

nearly opposite the Church, sand-pits of considerable depth, from which large quantities

of sand are being continually carted for the purposes of ballast or manure. Other sec-
tions, precisely similar to the above, are to be found more inland, the most interesting
of which is perhaps that in a pit by the side of the road at the Green leading towards

New Quay. The stratum of sand here is not, it is true, more than C inches thick;

but lying as it does inider about 8 inches of soil, upon one of the highest points in the

island, the section is valuable, as showing that in all probability, at one time the whole

of the surface of the island has been capped with sand which has been washed away
from those portions where it is now deficient, leaving the underlying stratum of brown

clay visible. But there is another very curious geologic feature which will tell the

same tale of the former submergence of the land, to allow of these arenaceous accu-
mulations upon its highest points. Immediately behind the Guard House, inside the

gateway of the garrison on the Hugh, is a kind of shallow cavern, which is now used

as a place for storing lumber. The rough blocks of granite have fallen from the top

of the entrance, so as to form a rude arch ; and imbedded in the rock forming the

sides of the entrance, are to be seen several large round boulders of granite, almost as

regular as if they had been turned in a lathe, and compactly fixed in the matrix of

the rock. Now this spot is considerably above the present level of the sea (probably

from 150 to 180 feet), and the boulders of granite have all the marks of having been

long rolled on a rough sea-beach. Moreover, the author was assured by the same
masons as those referred to above (two brothers of the name of Williams), that they

had been enga<!;ed in repairing the Guard House floor, and in digging beneath it they

found other boulders of precisely the same character as those at the sides of the cave

firmly imbedded in the soil. It is manifest then that the spot now adjoining the

Guard House must once have been on a level with the surrounding sea, or at any rate

at no great elevation above it, in order to account for the presence of these rounded

boulders so deeply impacted in the solid rock. It becomes interesting therefore to

inquire whether there are any traces of volcanic or subterranean action still visible in

the islands, to which this upheaving of the land, after one, or it may have been fre-

quent submersions, may be attributed. Mr. Statliam entered largely into this part of
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                               Ill

his subject, and showed that seveial trachytic veins exist, which will partly account

not only for the elevation of the land after its submergence beneath the ocean, but

for the innumerable craclis or joints which are almost universally traceable in the

granite of these islands. In the direction of the Causeway, which at low water joins

Taylor's Island to the main land of St. Mary's, he had detected one sixch vein or

dyke about 1 2 feet wide, and having the granite materially altered in character on

each side of the erupted matter. To the existence of this dyke he attributed the

alteration in the character of the granite on Taylor's Island, which exhibits crystals

of tourmaline, replacing the mica. On the north side of Forthloo Bay likewise he

had found at low water portions of a porphyritic ridge running parallel with the line

of coast stretching out to Newford Island about N.W. by W. But by far the most

interesting relic of igneous action in St. Mary's is to be found in the Elvan Course in

Watermill Bay, near New Quay, to the N.E. of the island; and the author fully de-

scribed it, and gave a detailed account of his theory for explaining the apparent stra-
Atification of the granite in the immediate neighbourhood.

of the most striking groups of the rocks concluded the paper, with some curious

facts as to the wearing action of the atmosphere and moisture in the direction of the

joints in the granite, which had produced some extraordinary configurations, particu-

larly at the Pulpit rock, the Tooth rock. Giant's Castle, and in Forth Hellick Bay.

        On the Superficial Deposits of the Valley of the Aire at Leeds.

                        By Thomas P. Teale, F.L.S.

   In 1852 numerous large bones were discovered in the brick-earth nearLeeds, which,
being taken to Mr. Denny, the able and zealous Curator of the Leeds Philosophical

Aand Literary Society, were identified by him as the bones of the Hippopotamus.

fine collection of these bones, along with the remains of other mammalia, are now
preserved in the Museum of this Society in Leeds.

   The geological age of the deposit in which the bones were foimd became a question
of great interest ; and in the hope of contributing in some degree to its solution, I

venture to offer the following observations to the British Association.
   I have no hesitation in stating that the Hipi)opotamus major is the particular species

found in the valley of the Aire. In this opinion I am confirmed by Mr. Woodward
of the British Museum, and by Dr. Falconer. Of this animal, the Leeds Museum
possesses the bones of at least four individuals of different ages and sizes. The

skeleton of one of these is nearly entire. The vertebrae and cranium were found
lying in their proper relative position, the ribs also, and the bones of the extremities.
The bones had not the least appearance of being drifted or water-worn. Besides the
bones of Hippopotamus, the tibia and portion of tusk, and some other bones of an
elephant were found, but these are not sufficient to determine the specific form of
elephant. 'J'he lower jaw of a gigantic ox, presumed to be the Urus, the jaws and

horn-cores of smaller oxen, the horns of a large round-antlered deer, of a smaller

deer, and the bones of a horse were also found in the same deposit. To determine

the age of this fossiliferous deposit, it is necessary to take a survey of all those
materials which overlie the outbreak of the coal formation in the Vale of Leeds.

   These may be arranged under three distinct heads, each of which requires separate
consideration :-- 1st. The blue clay, which is the oldest. 2ndly. The yellow clay.
Srdly. The warp, the newest in order of deposition in which the mammalian remains

--were found.
   1 . The Blue Clay. In many localities is found a clay of a more or less blue colour

on first being exposed, but becoming brownish or yellowish on exposure to the air.
Wherever this blue clay is found in the Leeds district, it immediately overlies the out-
break of the coal formation. It occurs in irregular and isolated patches, often abruptly
sloping off, and evidently showing that it owes the apparent irregularity of its distri-
bution to the operation of denuding causes. It is seen in the Vale of Leeds at 140 feet
above the sea-level ; on the north of the river it is found at various elevations, up to
the higher lands between the Aire and the Wharfe ; for example, at Nether Green, at
 175 feet of sea-level ; at Woodhouse Moor, 300 feet; at Adel, 375 feet; at Yeadon

Colliery, 420 feet. On the south, between the Aire and Calder, it is found at various

 elevations, and at Adwalton is seen at the elevation of 600 feet.
--112 REPORT 1858.

The rocky contents of tliis blue clay are of considerable interest, as they consist of

rolled or far-travelled stones. At Nether Green, these are chiefly sandstones of great
hardness, and of polished surface. At Woodliouse Moor, these hard rolled sandstones
are in great numbers, and occasional masses of cliertz from the mountain limestone.
The nearest locality for this cliertz is 25 miles, but it may probably have travelled 50
or 80 miles. At Adel, along with the hard polished sandstones, boulders of chertz and
of mountain limestones occur. These must have been drifted over the higher ranges
of land between the Aire and the Wharfe, and not swept down the valleys. Portions

of trap-rock have also been found in the blue clay at Adel, anrl also a piece of red
porphyry, which cannot have been derived from a nearer source than Westmoreland.

At Yeadon the hard polished sandstones occur with abundance of chertz from the

--mountain limestone.
   2. The Yellow Clay. This clay is invariably found overlying the blue claj',

wherever they co-exist, and resting on the coal-measures only in the places where

they have been denuded of the blue clay. It is spread out more extensively than the

blue clay, but like the latter, its distribution is irregular from the effects of denudation.

It occurs low in the valley at Leeds, and ranges on tlie heights north and south of the

Aire, to the elevation of 300 I'eet at Woodhouse Moor, 375 feet at Adel, 420 feet at
Yeadon, and GOO feet at .Xdwalton ; in all these localities it may be seen overlying the
blue clay. At similar elevations it is often seen resting on the coal-measures, where
they have been denuded of the blue clay. The yellow clay has much influence in

modifying the features of the country near Leeds. It tends greatly to soften the

harshness of outline which the abrupt outbreaks of the member of the coal forma-

tion would have occasioned.

The rocky contents of the yellow clay are particularly deserving of notice. These

stones, often of large size, are for the most part angular or subangular, derived from

rocks in the neighbourhood. These are not fur-travelled stones, but still they are

travelled stones, and are not resulting from the mere disintegration of the rocks in

silu from aerial causes. This may be proved by an examination of such stones in the

Ayellow clay as can be identified with the parent rock.  good illustration of this

occurs at Headingley, in the grounds of Mr. Hewitson, who kindly directed diggings

to be made to assist me in these investigations. In one of these the yellow clay, 8 or

9 feel thick, rested on the sandstone shale of the coal formation. At this place the

clay contained great inunbers of stones, known as " calliards." These are sandstones

of great hardness, occurring generally in masses of subrhomboidal form. The bed of

rock which furnished these calliards is well known in the district, and has its out-

break from a quarter to lialf a mile north of Mr. Hewitson's diggings. The stones

therefore must have travelled this distance. These stones have had the sharpness of

their angles somewhat blunted ; they vary in size from a few inches to 2 or 3 feet.
Along with these calliards, in the same clay occur great numbers of stones of millstone

grit, somewhat more roinided than the former, but not polished by long travel. These

stones are easily recognized as being derived from the parent rock at Weetwood,

where we find a bed of very coarse millstone grit, easily disintegrated, having its out-

break from half a mile to three-quarters of a mile north of Mr. Hewitson's. Similar

observations might be made in reference to other known rocks of the district occurring

in the yellow clay.

 --3. The Warp. Under the name of warp, I would describe the true valley deposit

of the Aire at Leeds. The deposit is familiarly known to the workpeople of the

district under this name.

In position, tlie warp overlies the yellow and the blue clays whenever the three

co-exist. It is frequently seen resting on the yellow clay, or resting on the blue clay
when it has been denuded of the yellow, or resting on the coal-measures where they

have been denuded both of the blue and yellow clays. At Dickens Street, New Wort-

ley, it occupies a trough formed by denudation, resting on tlie yellow and blue clay

on each side, and on tlic coal-measures in the middle. At Becston Vale it rests suc-

cessively on the yellow clay, the blue clay, and the coal-measiu-es ; a similar arr.ange-
ment is observed near Sheepscar Bar, and in other localities. The warp is spread

over the valley of the Aire, producing a flat-looking surface, gently sloping upwards

at the sides of the valley, and downwards towards the estuary. At the sides of the

Vale of Leeds, the warp shelves off a little below the sea-level of 150 feet, and is not
        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.     113

foTind liigber than this level in tlie immediate neighbom-liood of Leeds. Prolongation

of llie warp may be traced up all the little tributaries of the Aire in tliis district as

higi) as to the level of 150 feet, or thereabouts.

    The diameters of the warp deposit are very variable. It sometimes approaches
to a tolerably pure blue or yellow clay, but generally it is much more earthy and
dirty-looking than the clays before described. In many localities it is very sandy,
and indeed passes into sand and gravel, more especially in the central parts of the
valley. It contains stones of very variable character, some angular and suban-
gular, derived from no great distance ; others rounded, polished, and far-travelled. It
contains much vegetable matter, as roots and fibres. Drifted wood, chiefly oak, is
found in great abundance in it; also the fir, the hazel, and abundance of leaves
and nuts. In the vestibule of the Leeds Museum is the trunk of a riven oak tree,

split as if by lightning. This portion of tree was found in the warp at New Wortley,

and bears evidence of the violence to which it had been subjected. The remaining
portion of the tree was not to be found in the neighbourhood.

    In its composition, the warp appears to exhibit an irregular commixture of dis-
placed blue and yellow clays, with their peculiar rocky contents, and also of a surface
earth and its abundant vegetation.

   If I may be allowed to speculate upon the cause of displacement and rearrange-
ment of these materials, I should attribute them to a gigantic land-flood, similar to
what we now occasionally witness, but more intense and more prolonged. By such a
flood, it may be presumed that the river was raised from its ordinary sea-level of 60

feet to an elevation of 150 feet, displacing extensively within its range, the blue and
yellow clays, and surface earth, and vegetation ; bringing down from the upper parts
of the Valley of the Aire, abundance of sand and gravel, commingling and rear-
ranging these varied materials, forming a flattish valley surface shelving off at the
sides about the level of 150 feet, overlying the blue and the yellow clay where they
exist within its range, and overlying the coal-measures where they have been denuded

of the clays.

   In this deposit were found the remains of Hippopotamus major, an elephant, a
gigantic ox, and a smaller ox, and other animals probably identical with existing

species.

   The inferences which I draw from the facts now recorded are,--

    1st. That the blue clay, overlying the outbreak of the coal formation, containing
far-travelled stones, and occurring at various elevations as high as 600 feet, is the
Glacial Drift of submergence.

   2nd. That the yellow clay, overlying the blue, occurring at the same elevations,
containing travelled, but not far-travelled stones, is the Glacial Drift of emergence,
occurring under a gentler current than the former.

   3rd. That the warp, overlying the blue and yellow clay when they co-exist, and
resting on the coal-measures when they are denuded of the clays, not ranging higher
than the sea-level of 150 feet, containing the bones of extinct mammalia, is a newer

deposit than the glacial drifts.

   4th. That the Hippopotamus major and an elephant existed in these lands subse-
quently to the Glacial Age.

On the Fe7is and Submarine Forests of Lincolnshire and other Localities.
                      By the Rev. Edward Trollope.

The author observed, that a great contest between the sea and land, leading to

frequent changes in their respective boundaries, had certainly been raging upon the

Lincolnshire coast for centuries before the arrival of the Romans in Britain, and

that period when written records began to be kept. The ocean had from time to

time swept far beyond its natural limits, and yet little by little it had, by its very

fury, aided to form a future barrier against itself by the accumulation of tlie silt left

upon its retreat, in concert with the earthy deposits caused by the continual flow of

the inland waters. At one time the sea had lorded it over a considerable portion of

the Lincolnshire coast, but afterwards fresh water became in the ascendant, and had

left the mark of its reign behind it in the form of soapy blue clay, varying in tint, and

abounding in fresh-water shells. The ocean, however, occasionally gave battle to

the fresh water, as was shown by the existence of channels filled with marine silt
running up into the blue clay. In this stratum grew up trees of various kinds, as
oaks of vast size, firs, alders, birch, and hazels, whose roots were yet firmly fixed in

the soil, while their innumerable trunks lay prostrate beneath the black peaty earth

composed of decayed vegetable matter. It might safely be assumed, that the period
Howof the growth of these trees lasted for five centuries.
                                                            long these fen districts

continued to be covered with stagnant fresh water after they had wrought such ter-

rible ruin upon thousands of acres of the finest forest lands, was not deducible from

any internal evidence ; but they certainly were for the most part still prevalent when

the Romans appeared upon the scene. They proceeded to encircle the coast with a

vast sea bank, to deepen and defend the outfalls of the rivers, and to construct drains.

But besides the coastal line of fen-lands, there were vast tracts in the interior of

Lincolnshire of a similar character, forming in the aggregate 522,000 acres, lying

from 4 to 16 feet below high-water level. The largest of these extended from the

Trent, through the isle of Axholme, into Notts, and far into Yorkshire, in the direc-

tion of Doncaster. It might fairly be assumed, that during the Roman occupation,

this vast tract of fen-land bore quite a different character to what it had since done

that it had a gravelly subsoil, and an ordinary earthy surface, covered with trees

not usually, if at all, subject to floods ; but that subsequently it became more or less

constantly submerged, so as to destroy its previous forest growth, and to cover the

bodies of the former vegetable giants of the district beneath an earthy deposit. This

great change had usually been attributed to the burning of the forests by the

Romans, on account of the covert which they afforded to swarms of suffering Britons.

There were apparent signs of burning about the stumps of some of the trees, but

others had clearly been cut down, and many had been torn up by the roots. The

felled trees would never so have impeded the flow of the inland waters as to convert

an immense district of previously dry land into a permanent swamp, as had been

suggested ; he would therefore endeavour to find another solution of this difficulty

in connexion with a still more remarkable fact, namely, the existence of the remains

of a submarine forest off the present Lincolnshire coast. Along the shore of that

county, from Sutton to Cleethorp, many banks or islands were from time to time

exposed to view. These were usually covered with silt, but when occasionally

stripped of that marine deposit, they were found to possess a substratum of moory

vegetable soil, filled with the roots and prostrate trees of very large size, accom-

panied by their berries, nuts, and leaves. Two questions arose in connexion with these
facts, namely. When were these districts severally submerged by fresh and salt

water ? and by what agency ? Various theories had been advanced for the purpose

--of solving these problems, the principal of which were : 1st, the interference of the

Romans with the natural drainage ; 2nd, a change in the coastal line through the

action of the sea ; 3rd, the agency of earthquakes causing subsidence of the earth.

The author examined in succession each of these theories, and gave his opinion in

favour of the last. He referred to the existence of other submarine forests at various
points of the shores of Scotland, England, and Wales. He observed that this theory

might seem to be more marvellous than the preceding ones, and therefore less likely

to be true in the opinion of those who were unacquainted with geology ; but when,

from the study of that science, they found that certain strata, the undoubted deposit

of water, were now upheaved far above the reach of that element, and that large

tracts of land had sunk beneath it, they could only regard such changes as one of the

usual, but always wonderful operations of nature.

The author cited other instances of similar phenomena, and in conclusion said

that he was inclined to think that a slow upward movement had begun to take place

in large districts of Lincolnshire long ago, and that by means of carefully conducted

scientific obsei-vations this would hereafter be certainly proved and accurately mea-

sured. The filling up of channels and estuaries of large size that formerly existed,

and the rapid growth of its coast at various points, apparently indicated this ; while

the known gradual but continually increasing elevation of the Danish coast and parts

of Norway greatly strengthened such a supposition.

Ow the Geological Distribution of Plants in some Districts of Yorhshire.

                            By Dr. Carrington.

   The chief tract taken for illustration was that part of Craven included between
Gordale and Kingsdale, and cut off on the south by the magnificent line of scars
known as the Craven fault. The physical and geological peculiarities of the district
were minutely described. The origin of the present vegetation was referred to dif-
ferent periods ; the more ancient portion, including plants of boreal type, being

probably a remnant of the Pre-Glacial Flora. The species found in Craven are 600

flowering plants, and about .500 mosses and lichens.

   After considering the present state of our information as to the geognostic relations

of plants, the following classification of strata was recommended, each group being

--characterized by a peculiar Flora : 1st, Calcareous formations, highly absorbent,

acted on by the elements chemically rather than mechanically (the carbonic acid in
water dissolving the lime), forming a dry, scanty, but fertile soil; 2nd, arenaceous

formations, disintegrating freely, and producing an abundant sandy deposit, on a

large  scale, forming  absorbent, barren  stations                                 3rd, argillaceous  formations, sub-
                                                                                ;

ject to rapid abrasion, forming clayey deposits, comparatively impermeable and

hygroscopic. In practice we find these often mingled together, e. g. shales with

sandstones ; and the soils frequently differ in nature from the rocks they cover,

having been derived from distant sources. The practice of agriculture has especially

tended to mingle and equahze the soils of various districts.

   The prevailing rock of Craven is the scar limestone. It supports the greenest of
pasturage, and most of the rare species are found on it, e. g. Acttea spicata, Draba
incana and D. muralis, Cardamine impatiens, Hutchinsia petrcea, Hippocrepis comosa,
Bryas octopetala, Saxifraga oppositifolia, Hieracium Gihsoni, Bartsia alpina, Primula

farinosa, Epipactis ovalis, Cypripedium calceolus, Lastrea rigida, and many character-

istic mosses and lichens ; the latter deserving especial notice from growing directly
on the rocks. The prevailing lichens are species of Collema, such as C. nigrum,

sfygium, fluviatile, &c., Parmelia crassa, P. calcarea, Lecidea lurida, Candida, im-

mersa, saxatilis, calcarea, &c., Ferrucaria immersa, Gagei, Dufourii, p/iimbea, and
epipolcea. The sandstones are restricted to the millstone-grit, capping Ingleborough
and other summits, upwards of 2000 feet high. They are covered by a coarse brown

vegetation of ling, heath, crowberry, bilberry, Juncus sqiiarrosus, &c. The lichens

                      By W. E. C. NouRSE, F.R.C.S.

                                                                                                8*

it was shown that immediately beneath the cuticle of leaves and petals is a layer of
cells of small size, circular form, and variable colour, which is named the Ret e. The
central layer of leaves and petals, consisting of veins and larger cells, is called the

Substance. In petals, the rete contains the colours, the substance being nearly or
quite colourless. In leaves, the substance contains the great mass of green colour,

the rete superadding the dark tints and marks. The present paper contains further

observations by the author.

1. Eight instances of leaves were examined during the autumnal change of tint.

The change invariably begins in the rete or layer of cells immediately beneath the

cuticle, whether upper or under ; and extends subsequently to the substance. The

Whenrete is thus the principal seat of the brilliant autumnal tints of leaves.  the

change begins on the upper surface of the leaf, it is first seen at the edges and in the

intervenous spaces ; when on the under surface, it is first observed in the centre,

and in contact with the principal veins.
   2. The examination of numerous kinds of variegated leaves showed that variega-

tion is invariably thus produced ; the young leaves are unfolded of one uniform tint;
then, when they are about half- grown, a patch of some other tint is developed on the
upper surface, in the centre, and in contact with the principal veins. Variegation
thus obeys an opposite law to that which regulates the autumnal tints and the
accidental markings of leaves. It is, furthermore, of two different descriptions ; in
one, the edges are v^'hite and the centre green, the young leaves having been unfolded
in a state of quasi-etiolation, and patches of green being afterwards developed in the
centre ; in the other, the edges are green and the centre yellow, the young leaves

being green, and yellow patches being afterwards developed near the midrib. In

both descriptions, in the green parts of the leaves, the rete, or layer of cells just sub-

jacent to the cuticle, affords, as usual, the deepest green, the substance being of an
ordinary green all through ; and in the light-coloured parts, the rete contains what-
ever colour is presented, the substance being whitish all through.

The patch thus developed, in one case yellow, in the other case green, begins to

appear only when the leaf has attained some growth, and has consequently exercised

its vital functions for some little time in contact with the atmospheric air. Then,
not at the edges, like chance markings or the tints of incipient autumnal decay, but
in the centre of the leaf, and therefore in contact with the principal veins, appears
on the upper surface the patch, of either colour, and from those veins it spreads.

Hence it is inferred, that the colouring matter in these patches, whether green or

yellowish, is in a high and vigorous state of development, quite different from those

tints which approximate towards decay. An accurate microscopical and chemical

examination of the cells and their contents, both of rete and substance, in the light-

coloured portions of variegated leaves, as contrasted with the green parts, is a

desideratum.

   3. Of the ordinary tints and markings of leaves, eight special instances were

examined proving that the substance is of a green colour which is very nearly uni-
                                             ;

form in all leaves, and that the rete is the seat of the extra tints and markings. In

regard to the veins and surfaces, these extra colours are invariably in one of two

situations ; either in contact with the principal veins, and in such case most con-
spicuous on the under surface of the leaf; or else quite away from the veins, occu-

pying the intervenous spaces and edges of the leaf, and then mostly seen upon the
upper surface. They thus obey the same law as the autumnal tints, and are probably

of similar nature ; contrasting remarkably with the law above stated which regulates

variegation.

   4. Numerous specimens of petals were examined, showing the absence of colour
in the cuticle and substance, and the localization of the brilliant colours in the cells
lying just beneath the cuticle, here called the rete. The most highly coloured cells

are generally the smallest, always lie densely packed together, and are commonly

roundish, sometimes elongated.

5. The anomalous organs in half-double flowers, partly stamen and partly petal,

suggested to the author that the pollen seemed to take the place of the coloured cells

of the rete ; and that the cells of the rete in leaves and petals, became, in stamens,

the pollen-grains. Sundry specimens were therefore examined, to ascertain how far

the shape and size of the pollen-grains bore any relation to those of the cells in the
                       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                              117

rete ; but no resemblance could be made out. This theory has yet to be confirmed

or superseded by further research. The floral envelopes stand in mid-relation to two

other sets of organs.  Without, we  find  their  analogues  in  the  bracts  and  leaves
                                                                                                           ;

Wewithin, they are represented by the stamens.   have thus, in an advancing order

of perfection and delicacy of organization, first the leaves ; then the petals ; finally the

stamens,-- organs long known to be mutually analogous, and, within certain limits,

--mutually convertible : the leaves, the organs most concerned with the nutrition of

the individual ; the stamens, most concerned in reproducing the species ; and the
petals, organs intermediate, both in place and in physiological relation, between the

two. In the leaves, the brightest colours, both in life and decay, obey like con-
ditions, and are alike contained in those subcuticular cells named the rete ; while

the great mass of the ordinary green colouring of the leaf is contained in the cells of

the substance. But in petals the substance contributes very little to the colours,

and the rete assumes a more prominent importance, and stands out as a more distinct

structure. Here, more nearly approaching to the organs of reproduction, the cells

of the rete display every conceivable variety and vividness of colour, besides being

Nowsmaller and rounder than the cells of adjacent tissues.      if it could be shown

that, in the stamens, the cells which in a petal would form the rete, take on a further

and more advanced development, with novel functions, and become the pollen, we

should then understand more clearly the meaning of the brilliant colours displayed

in the petals, and should recognize the rete-cells both in petals and leaves, as con-

Westituting a more important structure than at first appeared.       should be reminded

of the connexion, in the animal kingdom, between brilliant colours (so connected

with the dynamic effects of light) and the function of reproduction ; as well as of

those instances in which the decay of the individual bore a relation to the perpetu-

ation of the species, or in which the latter function was held in abeyance by the over-

nutrition of the individual. So, it is at the commencement of decay that the leaves
most simulate the bright colours of petals. So, by cultivation we over-nourish a

plant, and bring about significant changes : first, the pollen disappears, and each
stamen becomes developed into a coloured petal, which increases as we continue to

nourish ; then, as we proceed further, the plant refuses to flower at all, and instead

of petals, are produced leaves ; and instead of flower-like whorls, tissue is developed

between them, and they stand apart as leaves.

Should this view be confirmed, it might be worth while to extend the examination

to Ferns, to see whether the coloured particles of the rete do not become spores, the

cuticle forming the covers. The highly coloured and organized cells of a rete, in
plants of that lower stamp, may pass directly from the condition of leaf-colour to

that of the seed-particles of the species, without requiring the complicated inter-

mediate states and processes necessary in higher organizations. On casual inspection

of fronds, in various stages of fructification, the opening covers certainly look like

the splitting cuticle, gaping at those parts to give exit to the swollen and changed

granules of the rete.

Finally, there remains to be investigated the nature of the changes in colour both

in leaves and petals which are wrought in contact with the veins, and the diff'erences

between them and those which are produced apart from the veins ; the further con-
ditions affecting variegation, both in leaves and petals ; and the nature of those

petal-colours which are produced in the unfolded bud, independently of the influence

of light, and the respects in which they differ from ordinary petal-colours.

               On Suburban Gardens. By N. B. Ward, F.R.S.

   The author commenced his paper by describing the impressions made upon him
in early youth, in a voyage to Jamaica, by the glorious aspects of the sea and sky,

----the dolphins playing about the bows of the vessel, the flying fish alighting on

--its deck, and the occasional sight of an albatros, the tropical forms of vegetation
--on the beach and the hills, and the mighty world of wonders on the coral reefs.

--118 REPORT 1858.

   On his return to London he stated the great advantages he had received by accom-

panying the Professor of Botany, under the patronage of the Society of Apothecaries,
in repeated herborizations round London, which gave him a great insight into the

natural conditions of all the plants within twenty-five miles of l,ondon. On his

establishment in Wellclose Square, he endeavoured to fulfil these conditions in a
kind of terraced garden on the roof of his brewhouse, but with indifferent success.

This garden was destroyed by fire. A subsequent attempt to grow ferns and mosses
proved equally unsuccessful from the influence of smoke. An accident led him to

the employment of cases sufficiently close to exclude soot and other impurities, and
to retain the moisture. The first important application was the conveyance of plants
to and from distant countries, which proved so successful as to be universally

adopted. On his removal to Clapham he found that he was enabled to grow great

numbers of plants in the open air by supplying them with proper food, &c. ; and
therefore restricted the use of the closed cases to such plants as could not with all

his care be cultivated in the open ground. He expressed his belief that the cause of

failure in the cases arose, not, as had been stated, from the quiet condition of the

atmosphere, but from the much greater heat of the case when exposed to the
summer sun without a blind, the thermometer often rising from 20° to 25° higher
than in the open air. When the sun is obscured the temperature in the cases is not
more than from 2° to 15° higher. It is his firm opinion, that where the natural con-

ditions as regards heat, light, moisture, soil, and periods of rest are fulfilled, the un-
disturbed state of the air, so far from being prejudicial, is of great service. This
fact he has proved with numerous plants ; and he will feel extremely obliged to

those who will kindly communicate instances to the contrary. What strengthens
his conviction that heat is the cause, is the fact that in the spring and early summer
months no cases of failure arose. He exhibited, among other plants, specimens of

two fairy roses, the one having been in a case for three or four years, and the other
above twenty.

        On some Practical Results derivable from the Study of Botany.

                                 By N. B. Ward.

   The author commenced his paper by observing that Botany had not had fair play,
and that in many ways it might be rendered a much more attractive and useful
science. In the formation of an herbarium, for example, he considered that such a
collection might, in numerous instances, give a faithful, and if faithful, a beautiful

picture of nature. This position he illustrated by a series of specimens from the
Dovrefeldt range of mountains in Norway, and arrauged in three different ways,

--all of them conveying useful information : first, the association of such plants as

grow together, illustrated by a sheet containing forty or fifty species of plants from

--the highest portion of the range on the borders of eternal snow ; secondly, the

grouping of plants belonging to one natural family, as the Ericaceae ; and thirdly,
the arrangement of one or more genera according to their elevation on the mountain
side, illustrated by four species of Saxifrage, one of which grew at 3000 feet elevation,
one at 4000, one at 5000, and one at 6000 feet, respectively.

   He further remarked that the climate conditions of plants might be most unmis-
takeably shown by observing the spontaneous vegetation of hedge banks, &c., and

this was exemplified by a series of specimens from the banks surrounding the timber

plantations in the New Forest, and from a bank near Tintern Abbey, Monmouth-

shire, the former indicating a moderate, the latter an excessive amount of moisture.

   He then proceeded to urge the importance of cultivating a taste for legitimate
horticultural pursuits among the members of the labouring population, as it was a

well-established fact, that " whenever a pink, or a carnation, or rose was seen out-
side a cottage, there was a potato or a cabbage for the pot within ; that if there were
not happiness, there was the nearest approach to it in this world, content."

                             " Yes, in a poor man's garden grow
                                   Far more than herbs and flowers

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

                                Kind thoughts, contentment, peace of mind,

                               And joy for weary hours."

   H« coQcluded by a communication he had received from the Bishop of Kipoh on

the preceding Sunday, and which was, indeed, his principal reason for again appear-

--ing before them. The communication of the Bishop was to this eflfect : " The

parish of ArncIifFe, near Skipton, in Yorkshire, situated in a very wild part of the

county, and inhabited by a wild and lawless tenantry, had been for many years with-

--out a resident clergyman, the living being a very poor one not above ^^30 a year.

The present incumbent, the Rev. Mr. Boyd, determined, however, to set himself
down among them and to use his utmost exertions in bettering their Avretched con-
dition. To this end he surrounded his house with a fine garden, well-stocked with

--lovely flowers, and induced his peasantry--but with great reluctance to come in

one by one to see and admire his flowers, and to take them home and cultivate them.

Now for the first time they had light in their dwellings, and ultimately, through the

kind and constant personal care which was bestowed upon them, have become the
most contented and happy set of villagers in all Yorkshire."

    On the Epidermal Cells of the Petals of Plants. By Tuffen West.

   The author, in working on microscopic subjects, generally had his attention arrested
by that well-known object the petal of the geranium, and being unable to recocilen
its appearance with the descriptions found in books, was led to the investigations
now communicated to the Section.

    After detailing his observations on the epidermis of the petals and the hairs of a

--variety of plants, he came to the following conclusions : 1 . The prolongation of the

outer cell-wall of the cuticle of petals into mammillary protuberances is a usual con-
dition ; such elevations being, with rare exceptions, most marked on the inner sur-
face, and being hairs in a more or less rudimentary condition. 2. That the markings

on the parts here named (which may be divided into two kinds, lines and dots,

though examples of an intermediate nature occur) are both caused by corrugation
of the cell-wall, and not by external secondary deposit upon it.

               On the Reproductive Organs of Sertularia tamarisca.

                     By Prol'essor Allman, 3I.D., F.R.S.

The author called attention to the fact, that Sertularia tamarisca, which, like most

of the Hydroid Radiata, is strictly dioecious, presents the further remarkable cha-
racter of having its male and female gonophores (generative vesicles) totally diff"erent

--in form, an important fact, as regards the zoographical characterization of the

species.

   The male gonophores appear to be those figured by Ellis in his description of this
species ; they are compressed, somewhat obcordate bodies, with a short terminal

tubular aperture.

   The female gonophores are far less simple in form ; they are oval for about the
proximal half of their length, and then become trihedral with the sides diverging
upwards, while the whole is terminated by a three-sided pyramid. The sides of the
pyramid are cut into two or three short teeth along their edges, and each of their

basal angles is prolonged into a short spine.

   The trihedral portion, with its pyramidal summit, is formed of three leaflets,
which merely touch one another by their edges without adhering, so that they may
be easily separated by the dissecting needle. They consist of the same chitinous
material as that which invests the rest of the gonophore, formed doubtless originally
on the surface of an ectodermal lamina.

   The male gonophore is traversed by a fleshy axis (blastostyle), which gives origin
to one or more sporosacs containing the spermatogenous tissue surrounding a well-
developed spadix *. The spermatozoa have an elongated body of a cylindrical form,

with a long caudal filament.

   * The author proposed the term spadix to indicate the diverticulum from the common

cavity of the coenosarc, which in most of the Hydroid Zoophytes extends into the centre of
the sporosac, and round which the generative elements (ova or spermatozoa) are developed.
                       ;

--120 REPORT 1858.

On laying open the female gonophoie, the oval portion of it is seen to be occupied

by a blastostyle, which gives origin to one or more sporosacs entirely resembling the

male sporosacs except in the nature of their contents, which are here ova instead

of spermatozoa.

The oval portion of the gonophore terminates upwards by closing round the re-

mote extremity of the blastostyle, where it forms a ring with tooth-like processes by

which the extremity of the blastostyle is encircled. This oval portion constitutes the

proper capsule of the gonophore, and is the only part developed in the male. From

the summit of the blastostyle several irregularly-branched csecal tubes, apparently

communicating with its cavity, are given off. They lie altogether external to the

proper capsule, and embrace a delicate sac, within which are one or two ova in an

advanced state of development, each in a delicate structureless sac of its own, which

is continued by a narrow neck towards the summit of the proper capsule, with

whose cavity it would seem to communicate ; but the author did not succeed in
tracing its connexions beyond this point.

These ova, with their investing sacs, and the surrounding caecal tubes, would thus

lie entirely exposed, were it not that they are surrounded by the three leaflets already

mentioned as constituting the trihedral portion of the gonophore. These leaflets

are given off from the oval portion or proper capsule near its summit, and being in

contact by their edges, completely enclose a space which is occupied by the struc-

tures just described.

These structures are thus truly extra-capsular, and correspond with the extracap-

sular ovigerous sacs which occur inSertularia pumila, S. cupressina, and other species,

and into which the ova are conveyed from the interior, to undergo, as in a sort of

marsupitim, a farther development previous to their final liberation as embryos.

   With regard to the true import of the sporosacs and their relation to the Medu-

soid buds produced by other Hydroids, the author insisted on the necessity of bear-

ing in mind that the spadix has no ectodermal covering, and consists of endoderm

alone. He considered it to be homologous with the manubrium (" peduncle") of a
Medusa separated from its ectoderm by the intervention of the generative elements,

which in the sporosac are always found between the entoderm and ectoderm of an

organ strictly homologous with the so-called "peduncle" of a Medusa. By the

continued growth of the generative elements, the ectoderm is separated more and

more from the endoderm, which now constitutes a diverticulum from the cavity of

the blastostyle, enveloped by the ova or spermatozoa ; while the ectoderm forms the

walls of a sac which immediately confines these elements. The whole is enclosed in

an external sac, which seems to be an extension of the ectoderm of the blastostyle.

  We have thus, in the sporosac of Serlidaria iamarisca, an organ which easily

admits of comparison with the Medusoid buds of other Zoophytes ; it consists, in
fact, of a manubrium peculiarly modified, so as to constitute a sac for the retention

of the generative elements, and chiefly differs from the proper Medusoid buds in the
non-development of a swimming organ or umbrella. In other instances {Cordi/lo-

phora, ^c), as the author has elsewhere shown*, peculiar caecal tubes, generally
more or less branched, are developed from the base of the spadix, and thence extend,

along with the ova or spermatozoa, between the ectoderm and endoderm towards
the summit of the sporosac. The author had already compared these tubes to the

radiating gastro-vascular canals of a Medusa; and if' this comparison be just, they

remain in the sporosac as the sole representatives of the parts found in the umbrella

Aof a Medusaf.         change of position, however, has taken place, and the radiating

canals, having withdrawn themselves from the covering of ectoderm which they pos-

sess when forming a constituent part of the developed umbrella, are now composed

of endoderm alone, and lie between the endoderm and ectoderm of the manubrium,
where they form caecal processes from the spadix or endodermal portion of the ma-
nubrium.

    * Phil. Trans. 1833.

   t In a paper by the author on Cordylophora lacustris (Phil. Trans. 1853), he expressed his
belief that the umbrella of a Medusa had its representative in the walls of the sporosac
subsequent examination, however, of the sporosacs in a great number of species had caused
him to modify this view and adopt that contained in the present communication.

                              Remarks on the Migration of Birds.

By CuTHBERT CoLLiNGwooD, 3I.B.,3I.A., F.L.S., Lecturer on Botany at

                                  the Liverpool School of Medicine.

The author began by remarking upon the extreme interest of the phenomena of

migration to the ornithologist, and the simplicity of the general plan, which had been

unnecessarily complicated by the supporters of the now exploded doctrines of hy-

bernation and submergence. The fact that those birds which winter here (except

in those very rare cases which prove the rule) never breed with us, is the true key

to those phenomena. The fieldfare and redwing are impelled northward in April,

by the same impulse which brings the nightingale and blackcap to us from the South.

All retire from the advancing sun in spring ; and all seek those spots where they

themselves first saw the light, there to rear their young. This business ended, they

again retire to regions more constitutionally fit for them in the dead season. The

sun, therefore, is the great moving power, and the equinoxes the signals for migra-

Ation.  sexual impulse, arising from the development of the reproductive organs,
--drives them before the advancing sun in spring, a failure of temperature and food,

added to that of the reproductive stimulus, makes them follow, the retiring sun in

autumn. The author suggested, arguing from the analogy of the short internal mi-

grations of some British birds, that the period of lime during which a bird remains

in this country in summer might be taken as an index of the distance southwards to

--which he retires for the rest of the year, that the chiff-chaff, for example, which

spends fully six months of the year with us, retires to a much less distance in winter

than the swift, which remains absent from us nine months out of the twelve. The

conditions under which birds exist in warmer latitudes in the winter season, are

probably the same as regulate those which remain, the only difference being one of

constitution or hardihood ; that is, that our birds of passage require the higher tem-

perature, simply to keep them in the same state of active life which our indigenous

birds maintain under our wintry skies. As an example of these conditions, the fact

that, of our migratory birds, the males arrive usually a week or ten days in advance

of the females, seems to show that a separation of the sexes takes place with them,

such as is so common a phenomenon with our indigenous birds at that season.

That the migratory birds arrive in full song, the author was convinced from obser-

vation, it having frequently happened that a careful watch for their first appearance had

been rewarded at length by hearing just so much of their note as was sufficient for

one well-acquainted with it to recognize them ; but on the following day the woods

were resonant with the perfect notes of the very same bird. The recurrence of this

observation had convinced him that fatigue alone had been the cause of their muti-

lated song the previous day. Attention was next directed to the great discrepancy

which existed between the mean date of arrival of the summer birds of passage, as

given by different ornithologists. The mean dates given by White, Markwick, Jenyns

and another for twenty-five summer birds of passage were presented in a tabular

form, and exhibited a variation of as much as a month or six weeks for the same bird.

--This arises probably from the fact, that the experience of a single individual is liable

to fallacy, that he may not have the same opportunities of accurate investigation

in two consecutive years : consequently, certain dates in a series of observations are

much too late ; and these, when reduced to a general mean, destroy the balance of

Athe whole.    comparison of the earliest dates given by seven ornithologists, for the

same twenty-five birds, gave much more equable results, because probably that

observation was made under the best circumstances, and therefore most in accord-

--ance with truth. Still, however, there was something to be accounted for, some

influence which in certain seasons somewhat accelerated them, and in others retarded
them. The question arises, whence does this influence arise ? Surely not at the

point for which they are making, but rather at that from whence they are setting out.

We should not expect, therefore, that birds would necessarily arrive sooner in a for-

ward  season,  nor  later  in  a backward  one                     and experience  proves, what  reason would
                                                                ;

suggest, that the actual temperature of our spring is not intimately connected with

the earlier or later appearance of the migratory birds. The author, however, pur-

posed making a more careful comparison between the records of the arrival of the
birds, and the meteorological indications, than he had been able to do hitherto, with

a view to elucidate this subject. With regard to the destination of our summer birds
in winter, a large series of direct experiments was necessary to the proper compre-

                           By J. Davy, M.D., F.R.S.

 --In this paper the author referred, 1st. To the species of fish hitherto known in

the district. 2nd. To their habitats, remarking that one of them, the vendace, till

recently supposed to be jjeculiar to Scotland, had been found in Derwentwater.

3rd. On the causes of the distribution of fishes; taking the vendace in its limited

range as an example, two theories in explanation were offered as most probable,

--one, the transportation of its ova by birds, the other by floating ice, their vitality

not being destroyed at the freezing-point of water. 4th. The growth of fish, of

which remarkable instances were recorded, under the influence of unstinted and

fitting food. 5th. Of variations in the species, occasioned by different agencies.

The paper concluded by pointing out the necessity of legislative interference to pre-

vent the destruction of fish. They are now taken in largest quantities at the season

Awhen they arc about to deposit their ova, and when least fit for food.  closed

season should be instituted throughout the country, and parr and smolts should

never be taken.

 On the Cause of the Instinctive TendeMcy of Bees to form Hexagonal Cells.
                                  By R. L. Ellis.

   The author supposed that bees were led to the exercise of this instinct by the use of
their organs of sight. It was well known that, in addition to their facetted eyes,
they had three single eyes ; and he supposed that these eyes were placed in such a
position as to enable them to work within a range sufficient to give the walls of their
cells dihedral angles of 120 degrees.

          On the Arrangement of Birds. By T. C. Eyton, F.L.S.

   The mode in which birds obtain their prey is subject to considerable variation :
adapted to this variation are the various members and organs of the class. The

--principal modes in which birds obtain their prey are the following : By the power

of flight or direct chase ; by the power of approaching their prey unobserved ; by
the power of climbing ; by the power of scratching and running; by the power of
wading, and by the power of swimming. If a division of birds is made strictly ac-

cording to the above qualities, there will be many that will not conform strictly to
the greatest perfection of development adapted to each mode of living, but are

--endowed with a modification or mixture of two or more of them. Mr. Eyton pro-

poses to divide birds into the following orders : 1. Raptores, or birds of prey, con-
taining the families Vulturidas, Falconidae, and Strigidse ; 2. Noctivores, or night-

feeding birds, containing the Caprimulgidse, Trogonidse, andCoracinidce ; 3. Volitores,
or flyers, containing the Trochilidee and Cypsilidas ; 4. Lapsatores, or gliders, con-
taining the Alcedinidse, Buceridse, and Upupidee.

Prehensores or Parrots.    Cursores or Runners.
Scansores or Woodpeckers.  Rasores or Scratchers.
Erucivores or Cuckoos.     Littoreals or Shore-birds.
Insessores or Perchers.    Grallatores or Waders.
Bipositores or Pigeons.    Natatores or Swimmers.

   Mr. Eyton called the attention of the meeting to the peculiar mode in which the
coracoid bone is articulated to the sternum among the humming-birds, and exhibited
a drawing and specimens of those parts.

                   On the Oyster. By T. C. Eyton, F.L.S.

  At the Cheltenham meeting the author exhibited the young oystertakcn from the beard
of the parent. He now traced the young oyster from the embryo state in the ovary
to its perfection at five years old ; and exhibited a series of drawings on the history
of the oyster, the mode' of preserving the beds and increasing their productiveness.

            On the Anatomy of the Brain in some small Quadrupeds.
                            By Robert Garner, F.L.S.

   The comparative anatomy of the brain, little studied in Great Britain (Professor
Owen having been one of the few labourers in the field), has on the continent met
with more attention, witness the accurate researches of Tiedemann, Desraoulins, and
Leurct. As the importance of the subject in regard to zoology and physiology
cannot be doubted, the writer offers the description of the braia in a few small but

interesting quadrupeds dissected by himself.
   The two genera constituting the great family of quadrupeds, called Monotremata,

similar in some respects, as far as the brain is concerned, are in others remarkably
different. The Echidna Histrix has well-developed convolutions to its brain, that
of the Ormihorhynchus paradoxus is only marked by the rather deep grooves of its
vessels ; it has, too, a bony lamina between the hemispheres, which is wanting in the
other. The former has the olfactory bulbs very large, the latter much less. The
Echidna has not the little side lobules of the cerebellum, which in the Ornitho-
rhynchus are remarkable, occupying cavities in the temporal bone, and encircled by
the three semicircular auditory canals ; in the Echidna these last also exist, but deep
in the solid bone. The Ornithorhynchus has the two posterior prominences of the
corpora quadrigemina very little developed, less than in any other quadruped, if we
are not mistaken, making' therefore a gradation to their disposition in birds. Both
have the peculiarity (general, it would appear, in the Marsupialia and Monotremata)
of the absence of the corpus callosum. The two principal commissures are the an-
terior and the fornix, both well- developed, the latter being continuous behind with

the hippocampus major ; itself very large in such animals as have large olfactory

bulbs and tracts, with which it is connected. The remaining parts do not much

differ from other quadrupeds.

   With respect to the organs of sense, and the cerebral nerves supplying them, we
may commence (having already noticed that the olfactory organs are enormously

developed in the Echidna) by observing that the eye of the aquatic species, the Or-
nithorhynchus, has a supplementary valvular lid, the lens also being more convex

than in the Echidna. There is a lacrymal apparatus and duct in the usual place.

The cerebral nerves generally are upon the normal plan, but the duck-billed creature
has the fifth nerve very greatly developed to supply its curious mandible, which must
possess extraordinary sensibility, though of a subdued kind, from its leathery cover-

ing ; similar to that of a hand' with fine touch enveloped in a closely-fitting glove.
The large nasal branch of the first or ophthalmic division of this fifth nerve, running
in a peculiar canal, and the second division, of course, supply the upper mandible,

and the third the lower. Six fasciae of nerves, generally very large, are dis-
tributed to the former, and four to the latter, on each side. The author is not

sure whether mention is made in authors of the little saccular organs with

papillae, situated on the front of the palate, immediately under the nostrils, the latter

situated, of course, above, on the upper surface of the bill. Home does mention four

rudimentary anterior teeth in addition to those commonly enumerated. The origin

of the great fifth nerve is evidently below the pons from the medulla oblongata.
The external ear-canal is long and sinuous in the Ornithorhynchus, with a wider

opening and more regularly curved in the Echidna. The drum of the ear looks

downwards in this last, a little forwards and outwards in the first, and here too it is
smaller and longer. In both, the membrane is stretched on a separate rim of bone

like a tambourin. Home and Blainville give only two bones, but there is a loose

quadrate bone attached to the malleus, and on which the trumpet-shaped stapes
 rests; this must be the incus. The malleus is large and connected with the bony

circle, and also, as usual, with the membrane. In the Echidna the narrow Eusta-
--124 REPORT 1858.

chian tube opens just within the posterior extremity of the nares, whence a bristle

may be passed into the cavity of the tympanum. In the OriiUhorhynchus it appears

to be wider. In the Echidna the Vidian nerve, with another twig or two, is seen in

the roof of the cavity, and may be traced to the portio dura ; there is also a very

distinct tensor tyrapani muscle. The cochlea only makes one imperfect turn in

both animals, but the semicircular canals are completely formed. In the Ornitho-

rhynchus one surrounds the opening of the side cavity in the cranium, and gives origin

to one end of another which descends just outside the condyle, the third lying hori-

zontally round the floor of the said cavity. In this animal there is one large opening

for the' passage of the eighth and ninth nerves, partly closed by a membrane and

situated before the large occipital foramen ; the Echidna has openings for them in

the temporal bone.

Whilst the Ornithorhynchus is a sort of quadrupedic wingless duck, the Echidna

is, as is well known, an ant-eater, having a very extensible tongue, without teeth,
and its mouth situated at the end of a callous tubular muzzle. Of course, however,

such a muzzle must present a great difference in its nerves. In this animal the

nasal portion of the ophthalmic, for instance, is small (this nerve being scarcely

related to the nose as an organ of smell), and the other branches of the fifth are

also moderate in size. The two specimens of Echidna examined by the author
had evidently been amongst the ants, and the friend who forwarded them observed

that the animal's strength is enormous, that it burrowed in banks, and could roll

Howitself up into a ball.  beautifully the Ornithorhynrlms or Platypus is adapted

to obtain its food, insects and mollusks found at the bottom of rivers, must strike

any observer.

In three or four species of marsupial animals, Phalangista and Petauri, the brain

was principally remarkable for the peculiarity mentioned above, the absence of the

corpus callosum, the fornix taking its place somewhat, and having in front four pro-

longations, two going forwards above the anterior commissure, and two downwards

behind it. The cerebrum in all was perfectly smooth, whilst the cerebellum in all

the animals described in this paper is divided into lamellae. There are moderate

olfactory bulbs in front, the cerebellum has the "flocks" or small side lobules, the

corpora quadrigemina are well-marked and their tubercles equal, a little exposed, and

the hippocampus large. Indeed, with the exception of the peculiar absence of the

corpus callosum, leaving the third ventricle exposed between the hemispheres, the

brain in all these animals may well be compared to that of a hare or rabbit.

These remarks were closed with a few words on the encephalon of those curious

animals the moles, two or three species of which have been examined, including the

Condylura with a curious star-like snout, to supply which enigmatical part, the

supermaxillary nerves are greatly developed. Generally there was no difference

between the brains of foreign species and that of the common European species.

This creature, admirably furnished with an acute organ of smell, and a very perfect

internal ear (opening by a very wide orifice on the shoulder in the Condylura), has,

as is well known, a very small rudimentary eye, a mere dot in fact. Nevertheless

this eye has undoubtedly a true optic nerve, as was maintained by Treviranus and

Carus ; in fact, the figure given by the latter appears to me to be correct ; at any
rate, an optic nerve may be seen (by the lens) to whiten by the action of spirit,

when examined at its commissure. The brain of this little creature, in some respects

like that of the Echidna, has nevertheless a well-marked corpus callosum. The

olfactory bulbs and tracts are ample, and connected through the hippocampus with

the fornix, disposed as mentioned above. The anterior commissure is bifurcate on

each side, with extensive connexions. The optic lobes, or corpora quadrigemina,

are fairly developed, though the posterior one is certainly not so well marked ; but

still both are more so than could be the case if the sole relation of these parts were

to the organs of vision, so rudimentary in the mole. The circle of Willis and other

vessels are as regular and complicated as in the largest of the Mammalia.

 Oti the Death of the Common Hive Bee, supposed to be occasioned hy a

            Parasitic Fungus. By the Rev. H. H. Higgins.

On the 18th of March last a gentleman of Liverpool communicated to me some
                                    ;

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  125

Circumstances respecting the death of a hive of bees in his possession, which induced

roe to request from him a full statement of particulars. He gave me the following

-- myaccount: "In October last I had three hives of bees, which I received into

house. The doorway of each hive was closed, and the hive was placed upon a piece
of calico ; the corners were brought over the top, leaving a loop, by which the hive
was suspended from the ceiling. The hives were taken down about the 14th of
March two were healthy, but all the bees in the third were dead. There was a

                                       ;

gallon of bees. The two hives containing live bees were much smaller; but in each
there were dead ones. Under whatever circumstances you preserve bees through
the winter, dead ones are found at the bottom of the hive in the spring. The room,
an attic, was dry ; and I had preserved the same hives in the same way during the
winter of 1856. In what I may call the dead hive there was abundance of honey

when it was opened; and it is clear that its inmates did not die from want. It is
not a frequent occurrence for bees so to die ; but I have known another instance.
In that case the hive was left out in the ordinary way, and probably cold was the

cause of death. I think it probable that my bees died about a month before the

14th of March, merely from the circumstance that some one remarked about th.it
time that there was no noise in the hive. They might have died earlier, but there
were certainly live bees in the hive in January. I understand there was an appear-
ance of mould on some of the comb. There was, I think, ample ventilation ; indeed,
as the hives were suspended, they had more air than through the summer when

placed on a stand. When the occurrence was first made known to me, I suggested

that the bees might probably have died from the growth of a fungus, and requested

some of the dead bees might be sent to me for examination. They were transmitted
to me in a very dry state, and a careful inspection with a lens afforded no indication

of vegetable growth. I then broke up a specimen and examined the portions with a
compound microscope, using a Nachet, No. 4. The head and thorax were clean,
but on a portion of the sternum were innumerable very minute linear slightly curved
bodies, which, when immersed in water, showed the well-known oscillating or
swarming motion. Notwithstanding the agreement of these minute bodies with the
characters of the genus Bacterium of the Vibrionia, I regarded them as spermatia,
having frequently seen others indistinguishable from them under circumstances in-

consistent with the presence of confervse, as in the immature peridia and sporangia
of fungi. In the specimen first examined were no other indications of the growth
of any parasite ; but from the interior of the abdomen of another bee I obtained an
abundance of well-defined globular bodies resembling the spores of a fungus, "0001 2-

·OOOlG inch in diameter. Three out of four specimens, subsequently examined, con-

tained within the abdomen similar spores. No traces of mycelium were visible

the plants apparently had come to maturity and withered, leaving only the spores.
The chief question then remaining to be solved was, as to the time when the spores
were developed, whether before or after the death of the bees. In order, if possible,

to determine this, I placed four of the dead bees in circumstances favourable for the
germination of the spores, and in about ten days I submitted them again to examina-
tion. They were covered with mould consisting chiefly of a species of 3fucor, and
one also of Botrytisor Botryosporium. These fungi were clearly extraneous, cover-

ing indifferently all parts of the insects, and spreading on the wood on which they

were lying. On the abdomen of all the specimens, and on the clypeus of one of

them, grew a fungus wholly unlike the surrounding mould. It was white and very
short, and apparently consisted wholly of spores arranged in a moniliform manner
 like the filaments of a penicillura. These spores resembled those first found in the
abdomen of the bees, and did, I think, proceed from them. The filaments were
most numerous at the junction of the segments of the abdomen. The spores did
not resemble the globules in Sporendonema miiscee. The Rev. M. T. Berkeley, to

whom I sent some of the bees, found, by scraping the interior of the abdomen with a

lancet, very minute curved linear bodies which he compared tovibriones. He found
mixed with them globular bodies, but no visible stratum of mould. From the pecu-
liar position of the spores within the abdomen of the bees, and from the growth of
a fungus from them unlike any of our common forms of Mucedines, I think it pro-
bable that the death of the bees was occasioned by the presence of a parasitic

fungus."

On a New Species o/'Laomedea ; with Remarks on the Genera Campanularia
                and Laomedea. By the Rev. T. Hincks, B.A.

  A new British species of Laomedea was described under the name of Z. angulata,

which is remarkable as being the only member of this genus yet discovered, in which

the reproductive capsules are not axillary, but originate from the creeping fibres.
Mr. Hincks also described a remarkable variety of Campanularia Jo/mstoni (Aider),
which is branched, and bears capsules on the pedicle as well as on the fibre. In
these two forms, the supposed distinctive characters of Laomedea and Campanularia
are intermingled. There was not, indeed, a single constant character that could be
relied upon for the separation of the two genera, and he therefore proposed, with

Van Beneden, to range both branched and simple forms under Campanularia, aban-
doning the genus Laomedea. One section, however, of Campanularia seemed to liim

entitled to distinct generic rank ; that which includes the small and (for the most part)
sessile species, and for this he proposed the name Calicella.

On three New Species of Sertttlariati Zoophytes. By Joshua Alder, of

      ISeiocastle-on-Tyne. Communicated by the Rev. Thomas Hincks.

   The first was a Plumularia of well-marked characters, discovered by Mr. Alder,
near low-water maik, at Cullercoats, on the Northumberland coast : in ha!)it it very
much resembled a Ilalecium, but with ovicapsules similar to those of Campanularia
Johnsioni. It was named Plumularia halecioides. The second species described was
a Halecium from deep water on the same coast, for which the name of H. lahrosum
was proposed. The third, a foreign species, was found parasitic on gulf- weed from
the Atlantic, and was named Halecium nanum. The paper was illustrated by draw-

ings of the several species.

                        On the Homology of the Skeleton.

By G. M. Humphry, Surgeon to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.

Having lately been engaged in lecturing and writing upon the Human Skeleton,

the author has carefully investigated the whole subject of its homology, in relation to

the skeletons of the various vertebrate classes, and in relation to its development and

connexion with the nervous system. 'I'he conclusions at which he arrives differ, in

some particulars, from those of Prof. Owen, more especially with regard to certain

bones of the skull, such as the temporal bone, and the components of the anterior

or nasal vertebra. His views, and the arrangement he proposes, are set forth in the

accompanying Table I. In Table II. the bones are placed according to the plan of

Prof. Owen; the differences between the two being indicated by italics. He consi-

ders that the pelvis consists of the heeraal elements of two sacral vertebrae ; that the

scapular arch consists of the hsemal elements of two cervical vertcbrie ; and that the
limbs are appendages diverging from the points of junction of the hjemal spines with

--the heemal alse. The key to the comparison of the fore limbs with the hinder
--subject of much difficulty to anatomists is furnished by the fact that the limbs are

placed at the anterior and posterior ends of the trunk ; and that consequently the

opposed surfaces of their upper segments, as well as of the pelvis and scapula, are
made to correspond ; that is, the anterior aspect of the hinder limb corresponds with

the posterior aspect of the fore limb. This disposition of the parts takes place du-

ring development. At first, each limb is nearly straight ; the hands and feet bud out

from the sides of  the trunk ;  the palms and soles  look downwards                                                                   and the thumb
                                                                                                                                   ;

and the great toe look forward. Subsequently, each limb undergoes a quarter turn,

but in opposite directions. The anterior limb is rotated, on its axis, backwards ; the
posterior limb is rotated, on its axis, forwards ; the ilium and femur slant, forwards,

from the hip ; and the scapula and humerus slant, backwards, from the shoulder

the knee bends forwards ; and the elbow bends backwards. In the anterior limb,

mhowever, a rotation of the distal segments takes place, when the hand is pronated,

an opposite direction to that which has occurred in the proximal segments; and pro-

nation is the easiest position to man, and is the ordinary position with most other

animals.

      On the Liability of Shells to Injury from the Growth of a Fungus.
                            By the Kev. H. H. Higgins.

It has often been observed that shells kept for a considerable time in cabinets are

apt to lose much of their original freshness and beauty of appearance. This kind
of injury chiefly affects such specimens as have a bright enamelled surface, which at

length becomes dull and less pleasant to the touch. Several suggestions have been
made with reference to the probable cause of the change, which has often been at-

tributed to the efflorescence of saline matter absorbed by the shell. But, so far as I

have observed, the specimens most liable to injury from saline incrustation belong to

genera in which the shells are without enamel, as Littorina, Turritella, &c., and many

collectors are in the habit of steeping their specimens in fresh water for some days

--before placing them in their cabinets a process which is said to be an effectual pre-

servative from injury by saline efflorescence. Mr. Dennison, of Woolton, attributed

the loss of lustre in enamelled shells to the ravages of a minute insect, but had not

been able to detect the depredator. " Many of the shells in my own cabinet suffered

such serious injury during last winter that I was led to investigate the cause,

which, indeed, became obvious enough by the use of a microscope. An ordinary
lens showed the enamel of the shell to be beset with small bristly points, and when

a portion of the surface was scraped off and submitted to a higher magnifying power,

the forms of at least two species of Fungi became apparent, one resembling an or-

dinary Mucor with a globose sporangium ; the other, and much more common form,

exhibited both simple and moniliform filaments, with an abundance of minute spores,

seemingly quite free. After having been carefully washed, the surface of the shell

was found to be as if it were engraved in some places with stellular marks, in others

with strias forming irregular reticulations, caused no doubt in each instance by the

spreading mycelium of the fungus. It is scarcely necessary to add, that attacks of

this nature need not be apprehended where shells are kept in a perfectly dry or well-

Aventilated place.  slight deposition of moisture does, however, frequently occur

upon their surfaces whilst shells are undergoing examination, in which case it would

be a safe precaution to allow them for awhile to remain exposed to the air before re-

turning the drawer to the cabinet."

            On some new and interesting Forms of British Zoophytes.

                         By the Rev. T. Hincks, B.A.

  A new species of Plumularla was characterized under the name of P. similis, closely

allied to the P. echinulata of Peach. Two new species of Polyzoa were also described :
one as Avenella dilatata ; the other, vv'hich exhibits a new generic t)'pe, as Arachnidiu

Hij)poth'6oides, a delicate Ctenostomatous Polyzoon, curiously resembling in general
appearance the well-known Hippothoa. Mr. Hincks also drew attention to the re-
markable difference in the form of the male and female capsule in Halecium Beanii

and //. halecinum, and suggested the importance of inquiring how far this difference

prevails amongst true Hydroida.

On some Peculiar Forms of Spines found on two Species of the Spinigrade

                         Starfishes. By C. W. Peach.

The author stated, that having discovered a long slit on the under spines of Ophio-

coma  neglecta ?,  he was  induced  to examine  other  species                                   and  that on  Ophiocoma
                                                                                              ;

--rosula, in addition to those mentioned by Forbes, he found jaw- like ones on the under

sides of the rays, armed with hooked teeth much like one of the claws of a lobster

-- and likewise a hook on the tips of the lower straight spines, all directed towards

the disk. Similar jaw-like spines occur on the arm of an Ophiucoma minuta sent by
Dr. Dickie from the collection of the late Mr. Thompson of Belfast; and as the author

found several specimens, in all stages of growth, at Wick, N. B., in every respect like

tlie Irish one, he thinks that the latter is only the young of the former. From not

finding these noticed by Forbes, or any other writer on Starfishes, he has thought it

right to lay this before the Association.

 Notice of a number of Earth-worms and Larvcc of an undescribed Species

     found in draining afield upon his Estate. By Henry Peckitt,

   These worms were exhibited with a view to ascertain whether they were really
foreign worms, or the common worms rendered energetic from some particular state
of the soil. The working of the worm was first noticed about sixty years since on

the site of a stick or rubbish heap at the Old Hall of Thirkleby Park ; it has now-
spread over the gardens and park, and covers a surface of 200 acres. The casts are
so large and numerous as to render the eatage impracticable within 4 inches of the

ground. The workings are seen again at Baldersby Park, a distance of 8 miles,
the Swale intervening. About five years since a small beginning was discovered in
a field 3 miles from Thirkleby, which has now spread to an acre. The worms are
subsoiling the land, and the land is enriching from the great quantity of grass
yearly (wasted to the occupier) trodden down uneaten. From the site on which

they first appeared, it has been suggested that it may have been an imported worm

thrown from some garden pot.
   It was also supposed that the destruction of the rooks at one time at the park

allowed the worms to get a-head, but it is doubtful whether rooks take a worm
when other food is to be had. The field has a Rookery at the end of it. In collect-
ing worms for the Meeting, it was noticed that the rooks had torn up the grass in

various parts of the field, and on examination it was found they were after the larvae,

which were exhibited. This field was drained two years since 4 feet 6 inches deep as

a check upon the worm, but no effect is yet observable.

Notes on Myrmecophilous Coleoptera. By Dr. J. A. Power.

   I imagine that the interest of the entomologists of the Association may possibly
be excited by a tolerably complete collection of the known British Myrmecophilous
insects. It is a group which until recently has been almost unknown to our natu-
ralists, and embraces a considerable number of creatures which had hitherto escaped
their researches. Most of these singular animals .ippear to spend their lives, some-

times in the immediate vicinity of the ants' nests, sometimes in the very heart of

them ; and although endowed with ample powers of flight, wander but little from

their quarters. Hence it has happened, that only a casual specimen has now and

then fallen to the lot of the collector, whilst the greater part have been unknown, or

known only as unique, or nearly unique examples, and even their authenticity sus-
pected. Messrs. Janson and Waterhouse acting as pioneers, Messrs. Reading, Ed-

win Sheppard, Douglas, myself, and sundry others, have, within the last few years,

by carrying on the war in and about the nests themselves, brought to light many new
species, or found others to be abundant which were previously almost unknown.
Mr. Janson has, in the ' Entomologist's Annual ' of last year, published a most
valuable account of the habits of these insects, and the mode of searching for them.

I must say, however, that I cannot sympathize with him in his tender feelings to-

wards these voracious hosts of our coleopterous favourites. According to my own

experience, the spring, i. e. about April and May, is the most productive season for
examining the nests of Formica rufa (which affords much the greatest number of in-

sects), before the ants have actively begun their labours : the Coleoptera then seem

to be accumulated in their immediate neighbourhood, instead of being scattered over

a large extent of ground as they subsequently are. Soon after this period we often

see the ants commence the process of gradually deserting an old and inconvenient

nest, and taking up new quarters close by. I have found these old nests afford by

far the best harvest of insects, which in the appetite for formic acid or its odour,

(apparently necessary to their constitution), congregate amongst the few remaining

ants. If a few showers of rain should then fall and wash away the acid, the beetles

entirely desert the nest. The most efficient plan of search with this nest, is to place
a few handfulls of the material taken from near the ants, upon a somewhat fine cab-

bage-net, laid on a sheet of brown paper. Saprini, Dendrophili, &c. have a tendency,
when disturbed, to make their way downwards, and if, after a short time, you lift

the net to another part of the paper, you remove the debris, and leave the insects

behind. The outskirts of the nests should also be well examined, as Mr. Janson

1858.                                 9

describes, looking under stones, &c. The nests of Formica fuUginosa are more pro-
ductive rather later, when the ants are in activity ; but the investigation is to be car-
ried on chiefly in the neighbourhood of the nest, in damp places around it, and where
the ants run. The ground being stirred up, the insects will appear if you watch for
them. Little is usually to be obtained in the nest, which is generally in the trunk
of an old tree. The nests of F.fusca, F. fiava, and Myrmica rubra afford but few
species, and these are chiefly to be found in the galleries, under stones, &c. which
may lie upon the nests. It is reasonable to expect that more species maybe obtained
by the examination of the nests of other ants, especially as the denizens of one kind
appear seldom to associate with those of others. Formica fusca and F.flava seem to
be the most convertible, i. e. you often find the same insects in both. In the nests
of F. fuUyinosa you almost invariably find something. As to those of i^. rufa, you
get many in some, but in very many nothing. Of those of F. fiava, F.fusca, and
Myrmica rubra, you may examine hundreds and get nothing. As yet we have obtained
results from only a few species, viz. Formica sanguinolenta, F, fiava, F. fusca, F.
fuUginosa, F. rufa, and Myrmica rubra. The author illustrated his paper by speci-
mens of the ants, and under each placed the genera and species of Coleoptera usually

associated with them, and which may be expected to be found in their nests. He

also subjoined to the Catalogue remarks on the localities and habits of the individual

species.

mOn the Occurrence of Borabyx mori  a wild state in this Country.

By the Rev. F. F. Statham, hicumbenl of St. Peter's, Wahvorth.

   The author referred to the many costly attempts which have been made during
the last two centuries to domesticate the Bombyx mori, or common silkworm, in this

country, all of which had proved unsuccessful hitherto from the rigour of the climate

and other causes. He then instanced the following curious fact, as an illustration of

the power of instinct in enabling the insect to adapt itself to circumstances, and
argued the possibility of rearing a more hardy species of Bombyx, which might

hereafter be made useful for commercial purposes, giving, as his authority for the

statements, the Rev. W. Fox, curate of West Mailing, Kent, to whom he had been
indebted for them. On the 10th of July, in the present year, a number of silk-

worms, estimated at from 80 to 100, were found under a hedge in a place called
Banksfield, near West Mailing, not far from Maidstone, Kent. There was no ap-

pearance of the insects having been scattered accidentally in the place ; but, on the
contrar}', every indication of their having been hatched and sustained for some time
in the spot where they were discovered. The leaves of several plants in the imme-

diate vicinity were much jagged and eaten, showing plainly that the insects had for

some time been feeding upon them. A bush of the Rubm fraficosus, the common

bramble, among others, had been partially despoiled of its leaves. When discovered,

about three-fourths of the whole number had spun their cocoons, which were
hanging in all directions upon the weeds and the bramble referred to. Some were
just commencing the spinning process, while others were yet in the larva state, and
were feeding quietly or roving about in quest of suitable places in which to construct

their silken cells. Both the silk cocoons and the remaining larvae were subjected to

a close examination by the aid of a microscope, and were compared with other silk-
worms and cocoons, which had been bred or formed under the shelter of a house,

but no perceptible difference of species could be discovered by those who conducted
the examination. The reverend gentleman expressed his dissent from the opinion

which prevailed in the neighbourhood of the occurrence, that the insects had been
the produce of a moth which might have fluttered away from the town during the
preceding summer, and accounted for their appearance by imagining that some piece
of paper having the ova deposited on it had been blown from a window-sill or other
lofty spot, where it had been exposed to the rays of the sun, and had gradually been
swept by currents of wind into the locality where the insects were found, where,
having been favourably settled as regards warmth and shelter, the young larvae had
 emerged from their eggs, and sought congenial nourishment amidst the surround-
 ing vegetation. The author alluded to the recent failure in the breed of silkworms
 in France, as announced in the TYmes of the 9th of September, and argued the

utility of trying a series of experiments to ascertain whether (as apparently indicated

by the Town Mailing discovery) the Bombyx mori could not be reared upon plants of

indigenous growth, and without that amount of care and expense which have hitherto

been considered indispensable.

              On the British Wild Geese. By A. Strickland.

    Geese are a natural group of birds possessing several strongly marked characters
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

some of them are so alike in plumage that that important character can hardly be
taken as an element to assist in discriminating the species ; the form and colour of
their bills and legs, and the habits of the birds in a state of nature being all we can
safely rely upon : besides this, from their shy nature, they are the most difficult birds
to study; from these circumstances the authors of British Birds seem not to have
duly examined the characters of the species they describe. Mr. Gould has given us
but three species of British Wild Geese, confusing two species under the mysterious
name of Segetum, or Bean Goose.

 --Anas albifrons. White-fronted Goose. The plumage will mark this species ; it is

not, or probably never was, a regular migratory species in this country, but is found

in hard weather frequenting running streams and swampy ground singly, or in small

groups ; but is stated to be found in large migratory flocks on the continents of
Europe and America.

   Anas ferus or Amer, never was a migratory species in this country, but per-
manently resided and bred in the Carrs of Yorkshire, and probably the fens of Lin-
colnshire ; but it has long since been banished from these places, but still breeds
sparingly in the Western Islands of Scotland. This bird displays the same delicate
pink colour in its bill when young, as the Bean Goose does in its legs, and which
has eroneously been considered a distinct species, under the name of Pink-footed

Goose.

   From time immemorial one of the features of the north and east of England has been
the regular periodical appearance of countless flocks of wild geese which arrive about
the end of harvest, and which received the name of Bean Goose as coming in the time of
bean harvest, and when the bean stubbles were ready for them. Tliis species is the
only one that has any claims to the name of Bean Goose (or Segetum), the only migratory
sjiecies in this country, and the only abundant and common species we have. Unaccount'
able as the case may appear, this bird is not figured or characterized in any workol
Natural History I am acquainted with, and is not mentioned in the works of Mr. Yar-
rell, Mr. Gould, or Morris, further than ascribing the habits of this bird to one given
by these authors under the figure and description of an entire different species under
the erroneous name of Segetum, or Bean Goose. Some years ago, Mr. Bartlet, struck
with the difference between the geese he met with in the market and the descrip-
tions and drawings given of the Bean Goose, was induced to constitute a new species
under the name of Pink-footed Goose ; but this was an erroneous view of the matter,
being in fact the young or immature bird of the true Bean Goose. This bird, the
true Segetum, or Bean Goose, or Short-biiled Goose, is distinguished by its short and

strong bill, its depth at the base being nearly two-thirds of its length, and by its
migratory habits differing in that respect from all our other geese arriving every
autumn, spreading during the day time over the stubbles and clover fields on the
Wolds and other open districts, rising like clock-work in the evening, and winging
its way in long strings to the sand-bank in the Humber, and other safe retreats for
the night, returning as punctually in the morning to its feeding-grounds. This bird
differs from the Pink-footed Goose in being larger, having a stronger bill and lighter
plumage ; but these differences are the result of age, not of species, and due exami-
nation will confirm this. The next bird to be considered is the Long-billed Goose,
figured and described by Mr. Yarrell, Mr. Gould, and Mr. Morris under the name of
Segetum, or Bean Goose. This is distinguished by having the bill exactly twice the
length of the depth at the base, a proportion quite different from the Short-billed
Goose. Before the beginning of this century, when the Carrs of Yorkshire were the
resort of countless numbers of wild-fowl, it was stated that there were two species

of geese frequenting and breeding in the Carrs, known to the fowlers by the name
of the Carr Lag and the Grey Lag. What the Grev Lag was is well known. The

                                                                                                     9*

--132 REPORT 1858.

Carr Lag is not now easy to identify, but the author thinks it was this Long-billed

Goose, a bird that resided and bred in the Carrs along with the Grey Lag, and like

that bird is no longer to be found in these districts, and is now one of our scarcest
British birds, or almost a lost species. This bird is distinguished from the Beaa

Goose by its long bill, and its entirely different habits.
   The following is a list of the species :

  --Anas albifrons. White-fronted Goose. Face white, bill flesh-coloured (Gould,

No. 349) ; an occasional winter visitor in this country in small groups.

  --Anas ferus, or Anser, Grey Lag Wild Goose. Breeds sparingly in this country,

and is not a migratory species. Bill pink, nail white.

  --Anas Segetum, Bean Goose, Short billed or Migratory Goose. Bill short, strong,

the depth at the base being nearly two-thirds that of the length, pale red in the

middle, black at the extremities, but varies much in the proportions of these colours.
Old birds as large and pale coloured as a Grey Lag Goose. Pink-footed Goose,

smaller bird, less and darker ; the young of the last.

  --Anas paludosus, Carr Lag, or Long-billed Goose. Bill long and weak, being

exactly twice the length of the depth at the base, being 2| in. long and If in. deep

at the base. Bill strongly toothed, a groove running the length of the lower man-
dible ; colour same as last. Gould, plate 348, but not the description : not a mi-

gratory species.

On the Formation of the Cells of Bees. By W. B. Tegetmeier.

Having recently been engaged in making a series of experiments with a view to

determine the typical form of the cells of bees, and having arrived at some interest-

ing results, I am desirous of bringing them before the members of the British Asso-

Myciation.  first experiment consisted in placing a flat parallel-sided block of wax

in a hive containing a recent swarm. In this, cells were excavated by the bees at

irregular distances. In every case where the excavation was isolated it was hemi-

spherical, and the wax excavated was added at the margin so as to constitute a

cylindrical cell. As other excavations were made in contact with those previously

formed, the cells became flat-sided, but from the irregularity of their arrangement

not necessarily hexagonal. When the block was coloured with vermilion, the em-

ployment of the excavated wax in the formation of the sides of the cells was rendered

more evident. The experiment has been repeated with various modifications as to

--the size and form of the block of wax, but always with the same results, namely,
--that the excavations were in all cases hemispherical, that the wax excavated was

always used to raise the walls of the cells, and that the cells themselves, before

others were formed in contact with them, were always cylindrical. Mr. Charles

Darwin, to whom I communicated these facts, has repeated the experiments with
similar results. When these experiments are taken into consideration, in connexion

with the facts that in the commencement of a comb the rudiments of the first-formed
cells are always hemispherical, and that in a small extending comb the outer sides

of the bases of the external cells are always circular, they appear to lead to the con-

clusion, that the typical form of a single cell is cylindrical, with a hemispherical base

but that, when the cells are raised up in contact with one another, they necessarily
become polygonal, and if regularly built, hexagonal. On this supposition alone can
those numerous cases be accounted for in which one side of a cell is cylindrical, the

other polygonal. In all such cases it will be found that, in the cell adjacent to the

cylindrical side, there is not room (owing to some irregularity of the comb) for a

--bee to work, consequently the cylindrical development is not interfered with. The

formation of the small cylindrical cells surrounding the queen cell appear to admit

of no other explanation. The mode in which the circular bases, situated at the thin

edge of a comb in the process of enlargement, become converted into polygonal cells

as new bases are foimed on their outer sides, has been beautifully shown by Mr.

Darwin. In repeating, with many ingenious modifications, my original experiments,

he coloured, with vermilion and wax, the circular edges of the bases of the external

cells in a small comb. On replacing this in the hive, he found that the walls of the

cells were not raised directly upon these circular bases, but that, as other cells were
built external to them, the coloured wax was remasticated and worked up into the
--

polygonal sides of the cells ; consequently the colour, instead of remaining as a

narrow line, became diffused over a considerable portion of the sides of the cells.

These observations have been much facilitated by the employment of a hive having
each side formed of four parallel plates of glass, with thin strata of air between. As
thus formed, the escape of heat is so effectually prevented that the bees work with-

out the necessity of covering the hive with any opaque material, and thus they are

always open to observation without being disturbed by the sudden admission of light

into a hive previously dark. Crude and imperfect as these experiments may be, they
appear to me to have an important bearing on the theory of the formation of cells,

and my desire that they may be repeated and extended by other observers must plead
my excuse for bringing them before the notice of the Association.

                    On Aquaria. By N. B. Ward, F.R.S.

   The author proceeded to consider the application of those principles which had
proved so successful with plants to the subjects of the animal kingdom. At the

meeting of the British Association at Liverpool in 1838, he directed the attention of

the members to the extension of his principle to animals. He felt quite certain that
a great number of animals would live and thrive under the same treatment, and he

could see no reason why, at the same time that our stoves were ornamented with
Rafflesias, they might not be illuminated with Fulgoras and Candelarias. In the

same year he addressed a letter to Sir W. Hooker, in which he expressed his belief

that animals as well as plants might be imported in the case, and these views were
stated by Prof. Faraday at the Royal Institution. In 1841 he established the first
aquarium for fish and plants in his fern-house in Wellclose Square, his object being

--not to determine the counterbalancing influence of plants and animals in water, that
--having been ascertained long before by Priestley ; but to determine whether the

limited quantity of air in the fern-house would be sufficient for the well-being of the
fish. This plan was shortly followed by Dr. Bowerbank in a large glass jar, which,

when seen by Mr. Mitchell, occasioned the construction of the Vivaria in the Regent's

Park.

   Mr. Ward read a communication from Mr. Mummery, detailing his experi-

ments on marine animals and plants during his residence at Dover, illustrated by
some very beautiful representations of some of the animals which were living in his
aquarium. Of the permanent inhabitants were the following : Actinia crassicornis,
A. gemmaria, A. anc/uicoma, A. Diantkus, A. miniata, A. hetlis, A. vivea, A. mesem-
bryanthemum, Sertularia planula, Bowerhankia derisa, PedicelUna belgica, Tubularia

indivisa (in various states). Aphrodite aculeafa, Sei-pula confortuplicata, Pagurus Bern-
hardi, Portunus puber, Balanus halanoides, Buccinum undatum. Patella, jSolis lineata,
PalcBmon. The three following could only be kept for a very few days : Lepaa ana-
tifer, Cydippe pileus, Lucernaria auricula.

   Mr. Ward gave a glowing description of the coral reefs of Rottenset Island,

Western Australia, by Dr. Harvey, of Dublin, and strongly advocated the importa-
tion from thence of some of the beautiful forms of vegetable life, such as Caulerpa,
Bryopsis, &c.

    The paper was illustrated by a collection of cultivable sea-weeds from the herba-
rium of Dr. Harvey, of Cork, and a series of coloured diagrams of animals inhabit-
ing aquaria, by Mrs. Mummery.

On the Multiplication ofActinice in Aquaria. By R. Warington, F.C.S.

    The author described the several processes of reproduction occurring amongst these
creatures : the first, in which a portion of the base or foot becoming separated from
the Actinia, split up into three or four portions, each giving rise to a new Actinia;
the second, in which the body of Actinia was fissured or divided into two distinct
individuals ; and the third, when the perfect young are developed from the mouth.
The author called the attention of Naturalists to these points as being of use in
classifying the species, and gave the names of the many varieties in each of these
 sections which had come under his notice since 1851.

   ACHILLE FOULLE.

On the Sensational, Emotional, Intellectual, and Instinctive Capacities of the
  Lower Animals compared with those of Man. By Richard Fowler,

   M.D., of Salisbury.

   The author submitted that the Deity had formed all animals, both mentally and
corporeally, on one type. All had like sensations. All veitebrated animals had like
conceptions of persons and of places ; the constituents of memory, like the re-trans-

missions from conceptions to adjusting muscles of the functions of actions, as might
be observed by the barking of dogs and their efforts to run in their sleep. They had

like memory of persons and things ; like powers of comparing those with their con-

ceptions after long absence ; and like volition for the gratification of their appetites.

But they had not, as man had, such perception of objects and their relations as en-
abled them to form new combinations, and thus to be the source, by a sort of crea-
tive power, of new ideas. There was no instance of a physical force having been
used instrumentally by any of the lower animals. No monkeys, however often they

might have seen a fire lighted and been comforted by its warmth, had ever been
known to light a fire. They appeared to have like conceptions of objects, but not of
their qualities or relations to each other. The instinctive functions seemed to be
actuated by the forces of mind and vitality, by appropriate and limited structures,

with adjustible muscles analogous to the different organs of sense ; and this instinct-
ive apparatus, with like analogy to the organs of sense, had afBnit\' for the objects.

   The lower animals had one decided advantage over man in an uneducated state
their comfort was not disturbed by false notions of religion. Man was the highest
being to whom the thoughts of animals were directed, and their attachments to him
appeared quite as strong as those of men to each other. Animals had equal attach-
ments to home, and the nostalgia which a continued absence inflicts was perhaps as
painful as any that men suffer.

   Evils were common both to men and animals. The greater part of the evils in-
flicted on men proceeded from their own misconduct. But there were other evils

evidently intended to impel us to cultivate our intellect and our talents by searching
for the means to remove them. Thus the scurvy was an evil, and our search had
removed it by lemon-juice ; malaria was removeable by ventilation and drainage

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

distance of time and space science had removed by our railways and telegraphs ; the

dangers of navigation had been reduced by harbours of refuge, recent observation
of currents, and the rotations of storm ; small-pox had been antagonized by vaccina-

tion, pain by chloroform ; famine, the herald of pestilence, had been prevented by
agricultural improvements ; might it not be hoped that the mind would be equally

successful in diminishing the remainder of our evils ? Ignorance was perhaps our
greatest evil, the source of so many others ; crime the greatest of all, by the misery
which it inflicted. But how, as to the evils to which animals were liable, without
the mental means of subverting them ? To man this life might perhaps be considered
as a school of conduct, in which evils were our schoolmasters to urge us to " seek

that we may find ;" to " knock that it may be opened unto us." Even our mental
evils were lessons, when they were antagonized by thoughts and actions that tended
to the comfort of others, or the progressive advancement of our own minds. Was
iiot that a proof of the benevolence of the moral law by which we were governed ?
But animals had no such resource. Was not that an argument which should induce
man to act towards them as the Governor of the Universe deals with man ?

   No animal inferior to man has ever been known to create a work of art, discover
 a law of nature, and comprehend or apply it when produced by man. But man

creates works of art, discovers laws of nature, and applies them to advance his rank
in the scale of being. It may be therefore true of animals, that nothing enters the
 intellect but the single objects which pass through their senses \vithout perception

of the relations which they bear to each other ; but it is not true of man, who does
create new phenomena.

                    Notes of Experiments on Digestion.

            By G. Harley, M.D., F.C.S., F.R.C.P.E.

   The communication was illustrated by numerous experiments showing the pro-

perties of the saliva, the gastric juice, the bile, and the pancreatic secretion.

   The author stated that, contrary to an opinion lately published by Bernard, the
distinguished French physiologist, he had found that the human saliva contains both

sulphocyanide of potassium and iron. The latter substance, however, can only be
detected after the organic matters contained in the secretion are destroyed by burn-
ing. He had ascertained that a person of nine stone secreted between one and two
pounds of saliva in twenty four hours. 100 parts of mixed saliva yielded on analysis,--

   The gastric juice, the author said, does not destroy the power possessed by the
saliva of transforming starch into sugar ; consequently the digestion of amylaceous
food is continued in the stomach. The gastric juice has the property of changing
cane- into grape-sugar. 100 parts of pure filtered gastric juice, obtained through a

fistulous opening in a dog's stomach, yielded on analysis,

   The author made some remarks upon the cause of the gastric juice not digesting
the living stomach ; and said that his experiments showed that it is not so much the

epithelium lining the organ which prevented its being digested, as the layer of thick

mucus which covered its walls. When the latter substance is absent, the gastric

juice attacks the walls of the living stomach and digests them, causing perforation

and death. As regards the bile, it seems that this secretion takes an active part in

rendering the fatty matters of our food capable of being absorbed into the system.

The most curious of all the digestive fluids, however, is the pancreatic secretion, for

it appears to unite in itself the properties of all the others. It not only transforms
starch and other such substances into sugar, but it emulsions fats, and even to a

limited extent, as first pointed out by Pappenheim and Purkinje, digests proteine

compounds.

              The Spinal Chord a Sensational and Volitional Centre.

                                  By G. H. Lewes.

   The spinal chord, the author stated, was formerly believed to be nothing but a
great nerve-trunk ; and even now its functions have been limited to the transmission
and reflexion of impressions. That it can conduct impressions to the sensorium and
reflect them on the motor nerves, producing muscular contraction, is all that physio-
--136 REPORT 1858.

legists are willing to allow. Doubts having long rested on his mind upon this point,

the author had made a series of experiments, which, together with those of Pfliiger,

had led him to a clear conviction.

Before detailing the evidence for the sensorial functions of the chord, it will be

necessary to fix on some broad and palpable signs, such as unequivocally indicate the

Wepresence of volition.  have such signs in spontaneity of actions and choice of
--actions. It will scarcely be disputed that an animal manifests volition and its act
--is voluntary when the act occurs spontaneously. By " spontaneously," I mean

prompted by some inward impulse, and not excited by an outward stimulus. Spon-

taneity and choice are two palpable characteristics of sensation and volition, and it

is these we must seek in our experiments. Those who for the first time perform, or

witness, experiments on decapitated animals, find it very difl5cult to believe that these

animals have no sensation ; but their doubts are generally settled by a reference to

the admitted hypothesis of the brain being the exclusive seat of consciousness. On

the strength of this hypothesis, the striking facts recorded by Legallois, Prochaska,

Volkmann, and others, have been explained as simple cases of the reflex action of the

chord. Against this hypothesis of the brain being the exclusive seat of conscious-

ness, I have for some years gathered increasing strength of conviction, preferring the

hypothesis of the sensorium being co-extensive with the whole of the nervous centres.

From the mass of evidence furnished by experiments, all bearing on the same point,

the sensational function of the chord acquires in my mind the force almost of a

demonstrated trulh. Frora that mass a few cardinal cases may be selected. If they

do not carry conviction, there can be little hope in any accumulation of such cases.

Place a child of tv\ro or three years old on his back, and tickle his right cheek with

a feather, he will probably first move his head aside, and then, on the tickling being

continued, he will raise his right hand, push away the feather, and rub the tickled
spot. So long as his right hand remains free he will never use the left hand when

the right cheek is tickled, or vice versa. But if you hold his right hand, he will rub

with the left. The voluntary character of these actions is indisputable, in spite of

their uniformity ; they are prompted by sensation, and determined by volition.

   Let us now contrast the actions of the sleeping child under similar circumstances,
and we shall find them to be precisely similar. " Children," says Pfliiger, " sleep

more soundly than adults, and seem to be more sensitive in sleep. I tickled the right

nostril of a three-year old boy. He at once raised his right hand to push me away,
and then rubbed the place. When I tickled his left nostril he raised the left hand.

I then softly drew both arms down, and laid them close to the body, imbedding the

left arm in the clothes, and placing on it a pillow, by gentle pressure on which I

could keep the arm down without awakening him. Having done this I tickled his

left nostril. He at once began to move the imprisoned arm, but could not reach his
face with it, because I held it firmly though gently down. He now drew his head

aside, and I continued tickling, whereupon he raised the right hand, and with it
rubbed the left nostril, an action he never performed when the left hand was free."

This simple and ingenious experiment of Pfliiger establishes one important point,

namely, that the so-called reflex actions in sleep are not unaccompanied by sensation

and volition. The sleeping child behaves precisely as the waking child behaves, ex-

cept that his actions are less energetic ; and we are forced to assume the presence of
dim cerebral consciousness to escape the conclusion that the spinal chord is also a

seat of consciousness. The actions of the sleeping and the waking child are so

similar, that both must be credited with sensation and volition (and if not both, then

neither must be so credited) ; in like manner I shall show that the actions of animals

before and after decapitation exhibit no more difl'erence, as respects sensibility, than

the actions of the waking and the sleeping child ; so that here again, unless both

actions are credited with sensation and volition, neither of them can put in a claim.

Experiment leads decisively to this alternative, nameh', either animals are uncon-

scious machines, or decapitated animals manifest sensibility and will. [Having

detailed a series of experiments with a water newt, to show that the animal's actions

were precisely the same before and after decapitation, and arguing that they dis-

-- --played spontaneity of action the paper proceeded.] After allowing a quarter of

an hour to elapse, in order to a more complete reinstatement of vigour, I touched

the flank as before, with acetic acid. The movements at first were very disorderly.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                        137

The animal ran about in great uneasiness, just as it had done before its head was

off. In vain I waited for it to rub itself against the side of the box ; it curled itself

up, and seemed about to die. Some time afterwards I again touched it with the
acid ; it again became disorderly, and I then pushed it towards the side of the box ;
but it did not move until I pushed it slowly forwards so that its flank might come in
contact with the wood ; this succeeded: this seemed to supply the very remedy it
wanted, for it continued crawling slowly and with intervals of rest, its body curved

outwards so as to continue in contact with the wood, and its hind leg pressed close

to the tail, and thus, as before, it rubbed away the acid. There are two pomts

--noticeable here : first, the readiness with which a sensation of contact suggested a

means of relief ; secondly, that this was the only newt which, in my experiments,

ever hit upon this plan, and this one did so as well without its head as with it. The

repetition of the act precludes the idea of its being an accident.
   It is unnecessary to trespass on your time by citing the observations of numerous

physiologists testifying to the spontaneity of decapitated animals-- all remember

such cases. I divided the chord of a newt between the fifth and sixth cervical
vertebrae. The convulsions which followed were almost as severe as those which

follow decapitation. After a few minutes it tried to rise, but failed. Bubbles of

carbonic acid were constantly expired. After fifteen minutes it turned completely

round, and crawled five steps forward, dragging the hinder segment after it like a log,

the hinder legs not moving at all. This was repeated several times. In fifteen
minutes more sensibility was detected in the hinder segment. Here was a case which

--would have been pronounced very simple: Division of the chord had seemingly

destroyed all power of voluntary movement in the limbs below the section. The

hind legs seemed paralysed. When the anterior segment was irritated, the animal
crawled away dragging the posterior segment motionless after it. When this pos-

terior segment was irritated, the animal did not crawl, but simply withdrew the limb

or tail. If I touched the tail, or hinder leg, with acetic acid, the whole of the
posterior segment (in which volition was said to be destroyed) began to move, and

the legs set up the crawHng action, attempting to push the whole body forward,

which could not be effected, because the anterior segment was perfectly motionless.
The hind legs, which never moved when the anterior segment was irritated, moved

now in obedience to the spinal volition ; and the anterior segment, which before
seemed so energetic in its voluntary movements, was now perfectly unmoved. Each
centre rules its own segment. If the cessation of motion of the hind legs, when the

animal crawled, is a proof that voluntary power was destroyed in those legs, the cessa-

tion of motion of the fore legs, when the hind legs moved, is equally a proof that

voluntary power was destroyed in the fore legs. The real truth seems to be that each
segment has its own volitional centre. [Pfliiger's experiments, which the author had

repeated and varied, were here detailed, in evidence of the choice manifested by de-

capitated frogs.] I have at this moment a newt with the chord divided near the centre

of the back. The operation was performed four days ago, and the animal has so far
recovered from it that no spectator could distinguish between the voluntary power of

its two segments. When the flame of a wax match is brought near the cerebral seg-

ment, the fore legs set to work, and the animal crawls away, dragging the hinder

segment along. When the flame is brought near the spinal segment, the hind legs

set to work, and the body moves sideways, the anterior segment remaining perfectly

quiescent. All other stimuli produce similar results. I venture to submit that the

explanation proposed to meet this case, namely, that division of the chord produces

two independent volitional centres, is far more consistent with the phenomena, than

the explanation offered by the reflex theory : unless the actions of the posterior seg-

ment of the newt are evidences of sensation and volition. I know of no kind of evi-

dence for the existence of such properties in the cerebral segment.  ***

    I will not occupy the attention of this Meeting with the recital of other experi-
ments. Those already cited suffice to indicate the nature of the evidence on which

I found my positions.' And indeed I might rest on one simple fact as proof that the

spinal chord is a sensational centre, namely, the fact that whenever sensibility is

destroyed all actions cease to be co-ordinated. Every one knows how greatly our

muscular sensibility aids us in the performance of actions ; but it has apparently

been forgotten, that if sensibility be destroyed in a limb, by section of the posterior
--138 REPORT 1858.

roots which supply that limb, the power of movement will be retained so long as the

anterior roots are intact ; but the power of co-ordinated movement will be altogether

destroyed. With diminishing sensibility we see diminishing poM'er of co-ordination,

the movements become less and less orderly ; and with the destruction of sensibility

Nowthe movements cease to have their co-ordinated harmony.  in the cases I have
--cited it is clear that this power of co-ordinating movements sometimes very complex
--movements was nearly, if not quite, perfect in the decapitated animal ; therefore if

co-ordination implies sensibility, the conclusion seems inevitable that the spinal

--chord is a centre of sensibiUty. The whole case may be summed up thus: 1st.

Positive evidence proves that in decapitated animals the actions are truly sensorial.

2nd. Positive evidence, on the other hand, seems to show that in human beings with

injured spines the actions are not sensorial, but reflex. 3rd. But as the whole science

of physiology presupposes that between vertebrate animals there is such a general

concordance, that whatever is demonstrable of the organs in one animal will be true

--of similar organs in another and inasmuch as it is barely conceivable that the spinal

chord of a frog, a pigeon, and a rabbit should have a sensorial function, while that

--of man has none we must conclude that the seeming contradiction afforded by

human pathology admits of reconcilement. No fact really invalidates any other fact.

If the animal is such an organized machine that an external impression will produce

the same actions as would have been produced by sensation and volition, we have
absolutely no ground for believing in the sensibility of animals at all, and we may as

well at once accept the bold hypothesis of Descartes that they are mere automata.

if the frog is so organized, that when he cannot defend himself in one way, the in-

--ternal mechanism will set going several other ways if he can perform, unconsciously,

all those actions which he performs consciously, it is surely superfluous to assign any

consciousness at all. His organism may be called a self-adjusting mechanism, in

which consciousness finds no more room than in the mechanism of a watch.

On the Pressure of the Atmosphere, and its Potver in modifying and deter-
    mining Hamorrhagic Disease. By John Milligan, M.R.C.S.E.

   The chief object of this paper appeared to be to show that haemorrhage was in
many cases produced by extraordinary atmospheric pressure, numerous cases being
adduced in which bleeding occurred coincidentally with the fall of the barometer,
and for which no other cause was discernible. In order to obtain a more complete
elucidation of the subject, Mr. Milligan recommended the establishment of a system
of medical meteorology, to which medical men might contribute by constructing

tables presenting all the meteorological elements involved in or afi"ecting cases

occurring within their own practice.

   After explaining the nature and kind of the periodic variations of the barometer,

Mr. Milligan stated that the superficies of a human body of the average size would

measure nearly 2000 square inches, and consequently sustain a pressure from the
atmosphere amounting to 30,000 pounds, or nearly 15 tons, and that this weight

would vary from a ton to a ton and a half, according to the pressure of the atmo-
sphere, as indicated by the mercurial gauge. It was the peculiar relations that this

pressure bore to hjemorrhagic disease that Mr. Milligan proposed to investigate ; and
from numerous well-authenticated cases it was proved that a great number of attacks
of epistaxis and hsemoptysis occurred simultaneously with a depression of the mer-

curial column : moreover, that as a general rule hsemorrhagic attacks may be anti-
cipated at the periods that mark the horary oscillations of the barometer, and more

especially those that are accompanied by a fall of the mercurial column. In support
of these opinions Mr. Milligan adduced several striking facts, and from a registration
of 184 cases of various kinds of hsemorrhagic disease, the attacks commenced at the

following hours :--From 1 to 2 a.m., 15 cases; from 3 to 4, 7 cases; from 4 to 5,

32 cases ; from 5 to 6, 43 cases ; from 6 to 7, 70 cases ; from 7 to 8, 9 cases ; from
8 to 9 7'cases. Mr. Milligan concluded by calling upon his medical brethren to
keep records of barometrical measurements and heemorrhagic diseases, as it was only
by a well-directed and systematic course of inquiry that the true bearings of meteo-
rological phenomena to mortality and disease could be understood, and the per-

On the Influence of various Circumstances in causing Loss or Gain in

  the Weight of the Prisoners in Wakefield Convict Prison. By W. R.

   MilneR.

   The observations on which this paper were founded were made in the convict
prison at Wakefield on prisoners between the ages of 16 and 50, confined in sepa-

rate cells.

   The cells have a cubic content of about 900 feet, and from 30 to 35 cubic feet of

air is passed through each cell per minute.

   The air is warmed in winter ; the mean temperature of the cells for the year is
61° Fahr. ; the highest monthly mean, 66-5, was in August; the lowest, 56-9, in

March.

   The diet is uniform, subject only to such alterations or additions as may be ordered

by the medical officer in individual cases.

' The  prisoners  are  all  clothed  and  exercised  alike,  and  they  are  all  kept  at work
                                                                                                                      ;

the greater part make mats and matting of cocoa-fibre ; some work at tailoring and

shoeraaking, and a few are engaged in other employments.

The prisoners are all weighed on admission, and at the latter end of every month

during their stay.

   The observations extended over ten years ; the number of men under observation
was 4000. The average number weighed monthly 372, and the total number of

weighings 44'004.

   The results of these weighings were grouped with a view to exhibit the effect of a
number of variable conditions, viz. season of the year, period of imprisonment, em-

ployment in prison, age, and height.

   It was found that during the summer months the prisoners gained, and during

the winter months, lost weight.
   The change from loss to gain took place in March, and from gain to loss in Sep-

tember : these changes were not gradual, but abrupt.
   During the first two months of their stay at Wakefield the prisoners gained weight,

during the second two months there was a large loss of weight ; a small loss oc-
curred in the third period of two months ; subsequently to this there was a steadily

increasing gain, owing probably in a great measure to the extra diet given to those

who were falling off the most.
   The effect of muscular exertion was very clearly shown ; as it appeared that while

the men employed at sedentary work, such as tailors and shoemakers, gained on the
average nearly two pounds per man during their stay, those who worked at coir-

matting weaving, which is a very laborious employment, lost nearly seven pounds.
Of the former it had been found necessary to give extra food to 26 per cent., while
60 per cent, of the coir-matting weavers had extra food given to them.

    In the groups formed according to age, it at the first glance appeared that the

younger and older prisoners gained weight, and that the middle-aged lost ; but when

the numbers were corrected for the quantity which each group ought to have gained
by development, it was seen that the younger men, although heavier when they left

the prison than when they entered it, really sustained a virtual loss of weight,
gradually varying from nearly 5 pounds in those under 18 to half a pound in those

between 25 and 40 : the men above 40 gained weight.
   The influence of height was, that the men below the average height gained weight,

those about the average remained stationary, and those who were above it lost.

On the Form of the Eyeball, and the relative position of the Entrance of the
        Optic Nerve into it in different Animals. By T. Nunneley.

   The author observed, that the orbits are much larger than the eyeballs, and
that their axes diverge considerably in an outward direction, while those of the two
eyes are perfectly parallel. The eyeballs lie in the fore-part of the orbits, and ac»
cording as they are more or less prominent, and more or less covered with the lids.
--140 REPORT 1858.

do they appear to be larger or smaller. The 63^6 of the infant is larger, in propor-
tion to the size of the body, than that of the adult ; but it is by no means certain
that the eye of the male is larger proportionately to the size of the body than the
eye of the female. By some anatomists the human eye is described as a spheroid,
the diameter of which, from before to behind, is greater than in any other direction.

He had measured a great number of eyes, of the human subject as well as of animals ;

and he found that, wherever there was a departure from the spherical figure, it was
in the direction contrary to that which had been commonly stated. In some in-
stances the difference between the two diameters was scarcely perceptible ; in all,

where a distinction was observed, the transverse was the greatest. He had pre-

pared a set of tables (which were printed), containing the result of the measurement

--of 200 eyes of various creatures. In conclusion, Mr. Nunneley said " The measure-

--ments, I think, clearly prove that whatever part the fibres of the optic nerve play in

the phenomena of vision, and they, in all probability, only convey to the sensorium

--the impression received by the true retinal elements, the greatest number of them

are distributed on that part of the eyeball where there is the greatest range of vision,
and that the largest expanse of retina is on that part of the ball opposite to where
objects are placed, and consequently it is where the visual images of them must fall.
Thus the extent of vision is always in conformity with the space of retina on that

side of the optic nerve ; and as the rods and cellules appear always to correspond in
abundance with the fibres, that side of the retina which receives the greatest number

of images is most exercised ; or where the range of vision is the greatest, is always

the largest. That this is a fact I think a careful comparison of the position of the
eyes in the head, the size of the eyeball, and the exact position of the entrance of
the nerve into it, with the mode of life and habits of various creatures, will render
more obvious than a casual glance would do. To mention only a few instances as

--illustrations : Man, from the erect position of his bodj^, the horizontal placing of

his eyes, and his habits, has a more panoptic range than any other creature (of
course in this consideration all motions of the head, neck, and body of the animal
must be excluded, and those of the eyeballs alone admitted). In him the optic nerve
enters the ball not far from the centre, leaving, however, a somewhat shorter space
on the inner and lower parts of the retina than on the upper and outer. Now, while

man enjoys a free range of vision above the horizontal line, there are far more occa-

sions for him to look at objects below than above this line, and thus mere visual
images are projected to the upper and outer sides of the entrance of the optic nerve

oftener than to the inner and lower sides of this spot. In the pig, who sees at no
great range before him, and who seeks his food with the snout almost always in the
ground, whose head and eyes are consequently for the most part downwards and
near to the ground, the nerve enters the ball more outwardly and much lower than
it does in man. The pig wants not to see far before him, but he does require while

grubbing to look behind him, from whence danger comes. So with the timid herbi-

vorous animals ; look at the entrance of the nerve in the bullock and sheep, who
pass so much time with the head in a dependent position near to the ground with

the eye directed upon the surface, in open plains, where danger usually comes from

behind ; in them the upper and inner sides of the retina are much larger than the
lower and outer portions, while in the deer who live in more wooded places, where
danger is also from the front, but who, like the bullock, has the head downwards in

feeding, though the inner or anterior side of the retina is still larger than the pos-

--terior, it is so to a much less extent than it is in the bullock while the upper por-

tion still continues as proportionately large as it is in sheep and bullocks. On the
contrary, in the horse, who is not so preyed upon, who carries the head erect, and

 observes all around, the nerve enters the eye more nearly in the axis. In birds,
with few exceptions, the upper portion of the retina is much more considerable than
the lower parts, but the anterior and posterior portions vary much in different genera.
Those whose locomotion is performed principally by the feet, and whose range of
habitation is very small, as the common fowl and turkey, have the inner or anterior
 portion very considerably greater than the outer or posterior. Those birds whose
range is greater and who use the wings for progression, but do not wander very far,
as the grouse and partridge, have much less difference in the two portions of the
retina ; while in those birds whose flight is far and prolonged, as the crow, rook.

swan, goose, and duck, the entrance of the nerve is very nearly in the centre of the

--ball. So in reptiles : in the turtle, who only requires to see immediately before

and under him, the outer and upper portions of the retina are very much the larger.

In the more active alligator, frog, toad, and chameleon, while the upper portion

maintains its size, the outer and inner parts are more nearly equal. In those crea-
tures whose habitation is for the most part underground, as the shrew and the
mole, the eyes are so small as to have led Majendie to assert that the mole is without
the organ altogether, which is not the fact ; for I have found all the essentials of an
eye, even true retinal elements, optic nerve, and a well-developed choroid. Yet the

organ is so minute and concealed by the skin and hair, as probably only enables the
creature to discern the light, which is all that it requires ; for, living underground,
where it seeks its prey, it obviously must depend upon the acuteness of other senses
than of sight for its living. Though in the individual there is usually some propor-
tion between the size of the eye and the body, taking different classes and genera,
the size of the animal is a very little guide to that of the eye, the proportions between

the two being determined by other considerations than that of the bulk alone of the

creature ; for though, as a whole, the eye in fish bears a larger proportion to the

whole body than it does in other divisions of the animal kingdom, and the eyes of

birds  are,  as  a  class,  much  larger  than  those  of mammalia  or reptiles                                         yet amongst
                                                                                                                     ;

the different genera of all these classes there are very great differences, determined,

apparently, by the following considerations, amongst others not so obvious. When

the creature lives in feeble light, yet moves actively about, and is guided in its loco-

motion by the sense of sight, as in nocturnal birds and animals and fish, the eye is
very large, apparently to take in a large quantity of the feeble light ; on the con-

trary, where the creature is guided in its movements by other senses, then the eye
is very small, as in the bat, the mole, the shrew, and the eel. Where vision pene-

trates to a long distance, and where the eye enjoys great power of overcoming the

aberration of parallax, the eye is large, as in rapacious birds. When the brain and

intellect are more developed, the size of the eye diminishes, and the two eyes become

more parallel, as in man and the higher mammalia. Where animals are feeble,

timid, have but little defensive power, and are preyed upon, the eye is usually very

--large, as in the hare, the conies, the whole deer tribe, and many of the other rumi-

nants. Where the animal is not predaceous, and its size and strength are such as

--to protect it from being preyed upon, the eyes are commonly small, as in the whale

and the elephant : in the latter the eye is even smaller than it is in the horse, and

scarcely larger than in the eagle.

  On the Structure of the Retina at the Punctum Centrale, or Foramen of
                        Soemmering. By T. Nunneley.

   The author defined this punctum centrale retina as a small dark circular spot, g^th
of an inch large, situated exactly in the axis of the eye, and i^jth of an inch external
to the entrance of the optic nerve in the living human eye ; after which he proceeded
in great detail to give what he considered to be the correct anatomy of this part of

the retina.

On the Structure of the Choroid Coat of the Eye, and more particularly on
  the Character and Arrangement of the Pigmentary Matter. By T.

   Nunneley.

   The choroid coat is the dark tissue interposed between the delicate sentient retina
and the hard, dense sclerotic, and co-extensive with the latter. It begins at the
entrance of the optic nerve by a round aperture, with a distinct edge, in close appo-

sition with the nerve, but not organically connected with it, and passing forward as
far as the junction of the sclerotic and cornea, where, as choroid propei', it termi-
nates. It there comes in connexion with the ciliary circle or muscle, the ciliary body
and the iris. The choroid is essentially a vascular membrane, being made up of
blood-vessels, colouring matter, and a modified white fibrous tissue. The choroid
universally pervades the pigmentary nigrum, and is of a deep bronze colour, ap-
proaching to black. The pigment was described as consisting of two distinct forma
                                                                                  ;;

of cells ; on the inner surface the choroid, of true hexagonal cells ; and in the tissue,
and on the posterior surface, of stellate cells. The use of these cells was to destroy
the light as soon as it had acted on the retina ; and they were the most perfect
absorbers of light of any substance in Nature that he knew of. From the account
he gave of the arrangement of the pigment, it afforded what he considered a satis-
factory anatomical explanation of an abnormal condition of the eye which had
hitherto not been understood, viz. Muscce volitanies. The figures of those motes he
believed to resemble exactly portions of the choroid coat when teazed out ; and they
might be expected to appear and disappear with the varying condition of the vessels
arising from disordered stomach or the cerebral circulation, and be cured by what-
ever corrects those conditions ; or the muscae might result from different organic
changes in the choroid coat, which are incapable of being removed.

On the Results obtained from an Extended Inquiry into the Quantity of

   Carbonic Acid evolved from, the Lungs tinder the Influence of various

  Agents. By Dr. E. Smith.

The author gave a general account of a large series of experiments in which he had

sought to determine the true amount of carbonic acid expired and of air inspired, with

the rate of pulsation and respiration under numerous conditions, as, for example, in

the twenty-four hours with the ordinary meals, during sleep, with different and de-

finite kinds of exertion, during a prolonged fast, at various periods of the year, and
under the influence of all ordinary kinds of food when taken separately and alone.

He had collected all the carbonic acid expired during eighteen consecutive hours,

with short intervals for meals, and had determined the amount expired in profound

sleep in the night, viz. one-half of the average quantity of the day. There was a

very slight and gradual increase after 3 a.m. until the hour of breakfast, and during

the day there was always a rapid increase after each meal, and particularly after

breakfast and tea, followed by a subsidence to the original amount before the next

meal, if the meals were not too frequent. Whilst fasting (twenty-seven hours),

the quantity was uniform throughout the whole period.

He found that the quantity of carbonic acid expired varied most materially under

the influence of different kinds of food, states of the atmosphere, season, &c. During

the summer the respiration is ^th less than during the colder months of the year

and although the skin exercised most important functions, he found that it was not

vicarious of the action of the lungs in the expiration of carbonic acid ; for while

the lungs expired 600 grains, the skin threw off only 6 grains. The increase in the

quantity of carbonic acid after partaking of arrow-root was very small, but it was

much greater after eating oatmeal and rice ; whilst wheat flour produced the greatest
quantity, though the increase was less enduring than with oatmeal and rice. Tea,

coffee, cocoa, and chickory were found to be respiratory exciters, and consequently
increased the waste of the system, and could not be classed as food. As tea also

induced perspiration, it was most valuable as a remedy against the action of heat,

and would also be useful in cases of drowning and interrupted respiration. Tea
caused the evolution of much more caibon than it supplied. Brandy, sometimes ad-

ministered in cases of drowning, had the very opposite effect to that desired, since

it lessened respiration ; whereas tea increased the action both of the lungs and skin.

If the object were to prevent the waste of the system, then alcohol might be useful,

and tea would be improper. Both sugar and milk greatly increased the respiratory
functions. The experiments made showed that those who were more susceptible of

the influence of heat, were the least able to bear change to hot climates ; and if this

were borne in mind, it would be found of service to those who might contemplate

going abroad.  ________

of Andral and Gavarret, and of Scharling, and explained the particulars in which he

regarded them as defective for physiological inquiries. He then described the appa-

ratus and method which he had devised for the prosecution of his researches, and

which he considered to supply some of the deficiencies which he has pointed out.
It enabled the author to absorb the whole of the carbonic acid from any volume of
expired air, however large or small, during the period of expiration, and to measure
the inspired air for any period, however long or short. All the air admitted was

inspired and none was Respired twice ; and it was applicable to experiments with

the body at rest, or in active exertion, and during sleep or wai<efulness.

   The spirometer is a small dry gas meter of improved manufacture and registra-
tion, and moves with an inverted action. It was connected with a mask, which was

just large enough to cover the nose, mouth and chin, and had valves suitably

arranged to prevent a retrograde current, and to direct the expired air into the ana-
lytical apparatus. The analytical apparatus consisted of a " potass box," inade

of gutta percha, and divided into chambers and cells ; so that a column of air of

xi2 in.  in. was directed over 700 superficial inches of a strong solution of caustic

potass, and remained in so close and prolonged contact with it as to be entirely

absorbed during each expiration. There were the usual desiccators of sulphuric

acid of large capacity, and the balances employed weighed to the -oifth of a grain

with 71bs. in each pan.

                         Microscopical Apparatus.

Mr. C. Brookb exhibited a microscope and case very completely fitted up, but

having a stand of so simple and light a character as to render it very portable and

convenient for use in the open air, at the seaside or elsewhere. It has a new and

simple contrivance for the fine adjustment, and also for the rectangular adjustment

Aof the secondary stage.  tourmaline inserted in one of the holes in the revolving

diaphragm of a Powell's condenser, permits the use of polarized light, without any

change of illuminating apparatus.
   Mr. Brooke's instrument was fitted with a double lens, so that the power could

be changed from a high to a low one without unscrewing the glass.

   Mr. Ladd exhibited a microscope with an improved magnetic stage. The adjust-

ments are effected by means of a steel chain ; a moveable lever attached to the milled
head gives a very efficient fine adjustment; and the facility of moving objects deli-
cately by the hand afforded by the magnetic stage was remarked upon as a great

advantage.

  Mr. Warington described some additions which he had made to his portable

microscope, by which living objects, as Polyzoa, &c., contained in glass bottles or
small aquaria, could be examined with greater ease, over lengthened periods of time,
and without disturbing them from their naturalized position.

                 GEOGRAPHY AND ETHNOLOGY.

   T%e business of the Section was opened by Sir Roderick Murchison,

           --tlm Preside7it of the Section, in these vxirds:

--Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me first congratulate our old members and adherents

who are present upon having once more assembled in the great and flourishing

county in which this Association had its origin. Twenty-seven years have elapsed

since a small band of men, of whom I was one, met together in the city of York to

establish the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and I rejoice to say
that it was under the presidency of a virtuous and patriotic nobleman, the justly

esteemed Lord-Lieutenant of the West Riding, the late Earl Fitzwilliam, and through

the skilful arrangements of the Rev. W. Verncn Harcourt and Professor John Phillips,

aided, indeed, by the eloquence of a fourth Yorkshireman, the Earl of Carlisle, then

Lord Morpeth, that we gained our first position. Few as were our members, yet,
even then, so heartily were we bound together in the good cause of the search after
the truths of science, that we felt confident of ultimate success.

   Holding our second meeting in the University of Oxford, the Association was then
divided into six Sections ; and to these another Section, or that of Statistics, was
added at our third meeting in the University of Cambridge.

   At that time and for some years afterwards Section E was appropriated to Medi-

cine; but the cultivators of the healing art, justly perceiving that they had materials

wherewithal to occupy a much wider field of research on subjects of national import-
ance, felt compelled to leave us and establish their own Association. The number
of medical men who have since annually met in large towns, to compare notes
and evolve new discoveries, have indeed proved the soundness of the views of the
seceders, who still left to us the cultivation of Physiology, which science thence-
forward became attached to the Section of Natural History.

   Thus abandoned, the symbol E remained for several years a dead letter, when
it occurred to me that, the sciences of Geography and Ethnology having been hitherto
very imperfectly represented in our Institution, it would be right to induce my asso-
ciates who composed the General Committee assembled at Ipswich in 1849, then and

there to fill up the blank by constituting a Section of Geography and Ethnology under
this letter E; and of the new Section which was thus formed I had the honour to be the

first President. In truth, the geographers and travellers who had been previously

tacked on to the Geological Section, finding that they had no chance of a patient
hearing among their associates the geologists, were dissatisfied ; and, having myself a
real love of both sciences, I felt assured that their separation, followed by this new
amalgamation, would be highly conducive to the best interests of each. Then, again,
the ethnologists were discontented at having no local habitation, and at being
compelled to form at several meetings a sub- section, seeking for a meeting-room
where they best could find it.

   The union of geography and ethnology was indeed so natural, the subjects of which
they severally treat are each so engaging and instructive, as well as popular, that the
result has proved most satisfactory. In short, this Section has been, and I trust will
continue to be, well-thronged by votaries, who rejoicing in the spirit of foreign re-
search, come here to gather knowledge from the lips and writings of distant voyagers
and travellers by sea and by land.

   As President of the Royal Geographical Society I have truly good cause to be
proud of the extraordinarily rapid increase in its members, and also in their quality
and character; for we reckon among them nearly all leading public men, as well as
the most distinguished explorers of foreign parts.

   This success is indeed the natural result of the very constitution of the body politic
of Britain and her extensive colonies; and, as there is no branchof science which is
more intimately connected with the best interests of commerce and manufactures than
that which makes us acquainted with the products and inhabitants of distant lands,
so I confidently expect that in this rich and prosperous seat of industry, the me-

moirs and descriptions to be read will be duly appreciated; for, although we cannot
expect to be every year honoured by the presence of such an explorer as my dear
friend Livingstone, I know that you will be well satisfied with the communications

--which other distinguished men are about to make to you.
    Lastly, Gentlemen, I hope that your discussions will be carried on with that
desire to elicit the truth, and that absence of any acrimonious feeling among amicable
disputants, which has characterized in preceding years the proceedings of this
flourishing Section of the British Association.

      Notes of a Journey through parts of the Alatou, in Chinese Tartai-y.

                             Btj T. W. Atkinson, F.G.S.
   During my wanderings in Central Asia I came upon several large river-beds, in

aome of whicli there was no water ; in others the streams were so small, that I found

it difficult to account for their formation. I shall therefore commence abruptly with

--an account of a singular geological phenomenon the evident trace of the sudden dis-

ruption of a mountain lake by a fearful earthquake at some distant period. Travelling

along the steppe, near the foot of the Alatou mountains, I came to the brink of one

of the dry river-beds frequently found in these regions. This was a large one, being

not less than a mile and a half in width, and 130 feet deep, and the banks being nearly

Weperpendicular.  succeeded in descending down a track made by deer and other

animals. All the party, save two, had reached the bottom. As we stood watching

these, the sand suddenly gave way under the feet of the last horse, and both man and

Weanimal rolled to the bottom, clear of each other, from a height of about 40 feet.

thought both were killed, but, on hastening to their aid, they rose to their feet; the horse

gave himself a shake and began to kick and plunge furiously, and the man burst into

a fit of laughter. All hope of returning by this track was now at an end, and we

rode on, making vain guesses as to what had become of the torrents which had scooped

out this formidable hollow. Sand and pebbles covered the greater part of the surface

near the middle we found several pools of fresh water, surrounded by beds of fine

sand, on which were the footprints of many animals of the deer tribe, and among

them the huge paws of the tiger. A little further we found a broad bed covered with

lai-ge stones, over which a stream was running rapidly, rendering it difficult to ford.

The opposite bank proved as high and as abrupt as the one we had descended, and

gave us much trouble.

After riding about eight miles along the steppe, we readied the great ravine ; having

passed some rocky masses, the rugged mountain jaws burst upon us in all their

grandeur. This was a terrific rent; the dark purple slate rocks had been riven

asunder by the granite, and heaped up into craggy precipices of enormous height. In

some parts the rocks were broken into sharp points, in others they were piled up like

huge towers, overhanging the base of these mighty cliffs. To add to the wildness of

the view, three large eagles were soaring fiar above our heads, and several others were

perched on the crags. Far up in this pass we found that part of a tribe had pitched

their yourts on some grassy slopes, at a point where the gorge branched off" in two

Wedirections.  slept here, and darkness prevented me seeing the objects around.

On turning out in the morning, I stood gazing. in silent wonder at the scene before

me. Immediately opposite, and about 300 yards from me, rose up a mighty mass

of dark basaltic rocks to a much, greater height than the distance from me to them.

--Tiiey were pillared and split into most curious forms some of them like watch-towers

guarding the pass. These rocks divide the gorge, which branches off to the south and

east. Looking up the southern branch, the eye rested on the snowy peaks near the

source of the Actou, and up the other were seen the dazzling peaks among which the

Bascan has its source; while near me shrubs and flowers were hanging from the

clefts, showing that spring was adorning these rugged forms in all her beauty.

   I found difficulties in the way of obtaining a guide ; the danger that beset the route
I proposed to take were so great that the only man who knew the country refused to

accompany me, but on showing him as a reward a flask of gunpowder and a few balls,

his eyes sparkled with delight and his objections vanished. Shortly all were pre-

pared, and we rode up the southern branch, passing the base of the basaltic cliffs, from

whence the view down the gorge was savagely grand. After riding two hours we

arrived at a part of the pass so abrupt that we could not ascend on horseback ; even

on foot it was difficult to scramble up. At last we reached a level space about 20

Ayai-ds long and 4 yards in width.  scene was now before us that few could look

Wedown upon without a shudder.      were standing on the brink of a precipice, and

looking into a fearful chasm. The rocks were dark purple slate, with a few shrubs

hanging from the clefts yellow and green moss covered the ledges, and at the bottom
                                                                                                        ;

was a small lake, the water appearing of inky blackness, while to the south the

mountain was so steep that it seemed impossible to ascend.

  We began our ascent, going in slanting lines, gaining but little at each tack, and

turning our horses with difficulty. As we ascended higher, each turning gave us a

deeper view into the terrible abyss, with nothing to stop either man or horse should

either slip. After great toil and no little anxiety, we reached the top. Our ride was

along a rocky ridge for several miles, from whence we obtained a splendid view of the

snowy chain of the Actou stretching to the east and west. Its vast glaciers and high

                                                                      ;

large picta trees, and encamped for the night. Early in the morning we proceeded

onward, when I saw, near the source of the Bascan, a very high peak, which had

evidently been conical in form, and this had been torn asunder. One-half only was

standing ; the rent was curved, and the upper part overhanging. No snow could rest

on this precipitous face, and the rocks appeared a dark purple. The snow that had

been accumulating on this mountain for thousands of ages, was riven into perpen-

Wedicular cliffs, 700 or 800 feet high, appearing like pentelic marble.                      had now

ascended about 1000 feet above the valley in which we had slept, and instead of rich

grass we were on mossy turf, with the rhododendron and chrysanthemum creeping

among the rocks, and covered with large bunches of beautiful yellow flowers. At

length we reached enormous masses of green slate shooting up into high pinnacles;

passing round these, we came upon a scene of terrible disruption and desolation, where

rocks had been uprooted and hurled down into one chaotic mass, of a most fearful

Aeffect ; extending to the brink of a vast rent that had cut the mountain asunder.

terrible convulsion must have taken place here. I had felt the heaving of the ground

during an earthquake when in a valley to the westward, and had listened to the awful

sound as it approached, deep in the bowels of the earth, and had apparently passed

--beneath me. I had heard the appalling subterraneous thunder as it rolled through

the mountain, now I beheld the terrific effects of one of these fearful visitations.

Beyond this point the horses could not go ; we dined, and our friends returned to

their aoul.

   The guide, two Cossacks, and myself began to descend, clinging as well as we

could to the projecting points, till we gained a narrow ledge extending along a pre-

cipice : the guide led the way to a break in the rocks. Here a part of the cliffs had
fallen, forming a stony slope, both steep and dangerous. After some slips and bruises

we reached another small terrace, covered with bushes and plants. Continuing our

way downward, and scrambling over many difficulties, we reached the bottom of the

gorge, whose sides were 1000 to 1200 feet high. Following this ravine we reached

a deep valley, about fifteen miles long and four miles wide, surrounded by mountains

varying from 5000 to 7000 feet in height. This had been a deep mountain lake,

proved beyond all doubt by the sand and shells spread over its bed. I also found the

water line on the cliffs, showing that the depth was 560 feet.

Nearly opposite to the gorge by which we had entered there was another in the

mountains to the north. On reaching it I found this was also a deep and narrow

ravine, and no doubt formed by the earthquake ; through this the water had rushed,
Wedraining the lake, and had formed the great water-course on the plain.
                                                                                             shortly

entered the chasm, which I found was about 120 yards wide, covered with fallen

rocks, among which a torrent was foaming with great fury. Our way was a rough

and dangerous one ; sometimes several hundred feet above the stream, and then

descending nearly to the level of the water. At last we reached a spot beyond which

Weto all appearance we could not proceed.            were now a little above the torrent,

which was hidden from our view, and close in front of us the rocks rose up like a wall

to an enormous height. A loud roaring of the water was heard, which induced me

to suppose it was rolling over a deep fall. The old guide told me it was Shaitan's

cavern swallowing up the river. The mouth of the cavern was formed by a rugged

arch about 50 feet wide and 70 feet high. The river entered this opening in a chan-

Anel cut into the solid rock ; it was about 30 feet wide and 10 feet deep.                   ledge of

rocks, about 12 feet wide, formed a terrace along the edge of the stream, and just above

the level of the water. When my astonishment had somewhat subsided, I prepared
to explore the cavern by placing my packet of baggage and my rifle on a rock, and

the two Cossacks followed my example. The guide watched these proceedings with

great interest, but when he beheld us enter the cavern he was horrified. Having pro-

ceeded about twenty paces the noise caused by the falling water was fearful, and a

cold chilling blast met us. From this point the cavern extended both in width and

Weheight, but I could form no idea of its dimensions.                          cautiously groped our way

on in the gloom for about eighty yards from the entrance, when we could see the river

-- --bound into a terrific abyss " black as Erebus," while some white vapour came

wreathing up, giving the spot a most supernatural appearance. Few persons could

stand on the brink of this gulf without a shudder ; the roaring of the water was dread^

could this scene be contemplated long, there was something too fearful for the strong-
Weest nerves, when trying to peer into these horrible depths.
                                                               turned away and

looked towards the entrance ; for a sliort distance the sides and arch were lighted up,

but the great space and vast dome were lost in darkness. I sat down about fifty yards

from the entrance, and in the twilight made a sketch of the scene. On leaving the

cavern we passed round some jutting rocks, and then entered the narrow chasm

--beyond. Its bed was covered with large and small rounded stones proving that

water had once flowed through this part of the gorge, and I have no doubt it still

does during the great storms in the mountains. As we proceeded onward, the ravine

narrowed into a mere rent, with overhanging crags, rendering the place dark and

gloomy. Our progress was slow and difficult, and we encountered many real dangers.

Having emerged from the ravine, we looked down on the last low ridge ; this appeared

about three miles across, and at a short distance beyond we saw the fire of our com-

panions blazing brightly. From this place the descent was steep ; we hurried on, and

shortly afterwards I was sitting at our camp fire, not sorry at having safely concluded

an adventurous day's journey of sixteen hours ; but the toil was not unrewarded · I

had convinced myself that the water which had burst from the lake had formed the

enormous channel through the plain.

Notes on the Russo- Chinese Frontier and the Amoor River.

           By W. G. Blackie, Ph.D., F.R.G.S.

The author remarked that the river Amoor claimed attention in consequence of

the command of its navigation having passed into the hands of the Russians, by

whom it had been opened to commerce and employed as a means of transporting

provisions, munitions of v^^ar, and supplies of troops to her forts on the Pacific. It

was one of the largest rivers in Asia, being only exceeded in length by the Yangtze

in China, and the Yenessei and Lena in Siberia. From having direct communica-

tion with the North Pacific Ocean, it was superior as a commercial highway for con-

ducting intercourse with foreign countries to the other rivers of Northern Asia, all

of which flowed into the almost inaccessible parts of the Arctic Sea. After descri-

bing briefly the origin and general course of the river, which is navigable for steamers

throughout its whole course to the junction of the Shilka and the Argun, a distance

of probably 1500 statute miles, the paper proceeded to give a sketch of the history

of the Russian settlements in the Amoorland, and their relations with China from

the middle of the 17th century to the opening of the Amoor to Russian navigation,

ceded by the Chinese in 1847, and the subsequent establishment of the fort of Niko-

lajewsk, at the mouth of the river. The advantages thus gained by Russia were

made apparent in 1854 and 1855, when large stores of munitions of war were trans-

ported from Siberia to Shilkinsk and thence down the Shilka and Amoor to the

ANorth Pacific, at a saving of nearly 3000 miles of land carriage.  more detailed

account then followed of the chief features of the river, the territory through which

it runs, and the native tribes inhabiting its banks. In regard to the suitableness of

the district for colonization, the genial climate prevailing at the southern bend of the

Amoor was adverted to, as evinced by the existence of the wild-vine, and the pro-

duction of an excellent quality of tobacco. The season during which the river is open

for navigation from the ocean was stated to be from abont the middle of June to the

commencement of October. At Kisi, however, the Amoor is free of ice for six months,

while the Bay of Castries is open for eight months ; and to ensure a longer season for

navigation than is attainable from Nikolajewsk, the construction of a railway is said

to be contemplated between Kisi and the Bay of Castries. The author remarked like-

Wise on the great advantage likely to accrue to Russia from the facilities afforded by

this river to East Siberia for sending her mineral and other riches to the ocean, and

receiving foreign articles in return at a much lower price than formerly. In regard
to the trade with China also, it was observed that a portion of the merchandise, now

annually sent overland to Siberia by Kiachta, might in future be transported by sea

to tho motrth of the Amoor, and thence up the river to the interior of the Country.

Attention was directed to the circumstance of an active trade being already carried

on bv the United States with the Russian station at Nikolajewsk, and the inference

                                                               10*

drawn that such a commerce must be equally advantageous to Great Britain, the
voyage from London, Liverpool, and Glasgow to Nikolajewsk being as short as from

New York; while from Singapore, Hong-Kong or Vancouver's Island, it is shorter

than from San Francisco.

On the Extension of Communications to Distant Places by means of Electric
        Wires. By Major-General Chesney, R.A., D.C.L., F.R.S.

   The special object of his paper, he said, was to urge the necessity of multiplying
the telegraphic communications of this country with all parts of the globe, and espe-
cially to propose a new electric route between England and America. He regarded
electric wires as the pioneers of vast social changes ; and if this view were correct,
those which at present existed would form but a small portion of that great network
of " swift messengers," which, if Great Britain desired to maintain her present mer-
cantile supremacy, must speedily connect the principal parts of the world. This
country, in fact, must follow the example of other countries ; for, if it were content
to see one portion of the Anglo-Saxon race far in advance of itself, and America en-
joying the lightning-like intercourse with every portion of her vast continent, it would
probably not remain equally satisfied to see Russia turning her vast means to such
an account as might secure to her in future what she had in the case of the late treaty

--with China priority by fully a fortnight of the most important commercial intelli-

gence. After pointing out the many respects in which a country derived advantages

from being able instantly to send communications to distant places, the writer gave
a summary of some of the principal lines of telegraph which have been made in

various parts of the world, or are in the course of construction. When addressing

this Section of the British Association last year, on the importance of railway
communication with India, he endeavoured to show that one line of electric

telegraph might be laid down from headland to headland, along the Red Sea, and
another through Arabia, partly in the bed of the Tigris. Both had been commenced,
and each would probably meet with difficulties, and even interruptions, but only
for a time, as the Porte was prepared to give the necessary protection. Ere long,
he hoped, both would be in full operation, and, by having a double line, the com-
munication would be kept up by one set of wires, in case of any accident to the
other. He suggested, that for still greater security, a third line should be carried to
the Persian Gulf. The latter would cross the Black Sea either from the Danube or
Varna to Trebizond, which is shorter than the former line to Balaklava. It would

pass without any difficulty or danger by Erzeroum, Tabriz, Teheran, and Ispahan to
the Persian Gulf at Bushire. Moreover, the Shah is ready, and even anxious to do

the Persian portion of this line himself. He thought that, independent of the ad-

vantages of having three lines, in case of any interruption, sufficient employment
would be found for all three. It was evident that it was equally important that
electric messages from this country to America should not depend upon a single
cable. Full employment would be given at all times to several sets of wires ; and as

it was now certain that submarine communications with America were quite prac-
ticable, at least two additional cables should be laid down across the Atlantic. He
thought that the difficulty caused by the distance between Iceland and Newfound-

land might be greatly lessened by taking another route to the latter ; namely, that
of Iceland and Greenland, as by this line the greatest distance from land to land
would not exceed 430 miles. The ice and the icebergs appeared to be the only diffi-
culties likely to be encountered, and he thought they would not prove to be very
serious. But as the latter when floated do not, and in fact cannot touch the bottom,

it is the opinion of Sir Roderick Murchison, and other eminent men also, that the

proposed line is eminently practicable.

On the Physical Geography of the Neighbourhood of Bombay, as affecting

   the Design of the Works recently erectedfor the Water Supply of that City.

  By H. CoNYBEARE, C.E., F.G.S.

   The water is collected in an immense reservoir, the largest in the world, about
fourteen miles from Bombay. This reservoir is made by damming up a portion of
the valley of the Ghoper, and the full extent of it is 1394 acres. As the rains fall
only once in a year, it is necessary to have a store of water for a twelvemonth's con-
sumption, and this is now supplied. There were both engineering difficulties and
facilities in the work undertaken, and these were described by the author. The
700,000 inhabitants of Bombay were now^ well supplied with water. There were
self-closing public conduits in the streets for the supply of the poor. In these works
it had been necessary to guard against offending the feelings or prejudices of the
native inhabitants ; hence in the valves and other appliances requisite in the distribu-

tion of the water neither leather nor animal fat could be used.

On the Effects of Commixture, Locality, Climate, and Food on the Races of

                       Man. By J. Crawfurd, F.G.S.

   The writer gave a review of the commixture of various nations, its effects on the
mental faculties of the different populations, their physical characteristics, and lan-

guage. He glanced at the effects of a change of climate upon any particular race.

It did not appear, he said, that colour and the more prominent physical attributes,
or mental capacity, had any necessary connexion with climate ; nor did he think that
climate altered the physical form and mental faculties of a race transferred from its

original locality to a new one. He then pointed out, at some length, that the

varieties of climate had a great influence upon the mental powers of a people ; and
proceeded to consider, under the last head of his paper, the question of diet in rela-
tion to the physical and mental character of a people. The physical character of a
race, he said, did not seem to be in any respect altered by the nature of the vegetable
diet of which it partook, provided the quantity were sufficient and the quality whole-
some ; but when the question of the diet of a people related to mental development,

the quality assumed an important aspect. No race of man, it might be safely asserted,

ever acquired any respectable amount of civilization that had not some cereal for a

portion of its food.

       Observations on the Lake District. By J. Davy, M.D., F.R.S.

    In this paper the physical geography of the Lake District was chiefly treated of
in relation to the varied beauty of its scenery, the peculiarities of its climate, and the
character of its native population. Its beauty was referred to several circumstances,
such as the admirable intermixture of the wild and cultivated, of lake, mountain and
meadow ; the graceful forms of the lower hills (attributable to glacial action) con-
trasted with the asperities of the higher, the mountain ridges and peaks ; the youth-
ful freshness of the woodlands, chiefly coppice, carefully attended to and regularly
cut, not without admixture of ornamental planting. Its climate was described as
most remarkable for summer coolness and winter mildness, for the large amount of
rain (partly the cause of both) without unusual frequency of showers, and with
moderate dryness of air, connected with absence of clay and a rapid drainage.
The people of the district, chiefly pastoral in their occupation, of robust make, and
of Norse origin, were made mention of as marked for good sense, and for thrift in
their dealings, rather than for imaginative power. In concluding, attention was
called to the influence of localities on health, and to the beneficial effects of residen-
cies at certain heights, approaching 1000 feet above the level of the sea. In proof
of the salubrity of the climate (apart from the ill-drained towns and villages), the
exemption hitherto of its dales from cholera was adduced, and the longevity of its

dalesmen.

 to the President of the Royal Geographical Society. By Consul Donohoe.

                 On the Configuration of the Surface of the Earth.

                             By the Rev. J. Dingle.

   Assuming, on the usual grounds, that the earth is a body that has cooled down
from a state of incandescence, the author pointed out how the natural consequences

of that hypothesis are distinctly traceable in the present configuration of the earth,

so as to afford a general sketch of its history. From the relations which the moun-
tain systems bear to each other and to the land, he inferred that the germs of them
had originated about the same time in the er.rliest period of the earth's crust. The
currents of a primitive ocean, as determined by known physical laws and modified by
the mountain systems already formed, appeared to him necessarily to have led to the
formation of the great continents in their present position, and when taken in con-

nexion with the vertical forces operating from beneath, to account for all their geo-
graphical and geological features so far as they have hitherto been investigated.

          Language no Test of Race. By the Rev. G. C. Geldart.

   First, in a negative point of view, it was attempted to show that language is too
uncertain an ethnological test to be of any practical value. This was instanced by
the complete discrepancy which exists at this moment betv/een the races and the
languages of the British Isles. Cumberland and Cornwall, for example, in language,
agree with London, and disagree with Wales ; while, as to race, it is directly the
reverse. Also, by the agreement in speech, notwithstanding the wide disconnexion

--of race between the Israelites and the Canaanites the genuine Arabs and the Arabic-
--speaking populations in Asia and Africa the Turks and the Greek-Christians in
-- --Anatolia the Romans and their subjects in Spain, Gaul, Etruria, &c. the Germans
--and the Sclavonians now absorbed by them in Prussia and North Germany the
-- --Bulgarians and the Sclavonians, the Magyars and the Ckomanians and by many

similar examples ; the accumulative evidence of all amounted to this, that since in

so many cases where the ethnological indications of language can be compared with
the actual testimony of history, the latter completely contradicts the former, " a
common language is" not even "prima facie evidence in favour of a common

lineage,"

    It was remarked that the probability of language being a fallacious test of race
must increase in direct proportion to the complexity of the particular race's expe-
riences. But since it is plain that without the aid of history we can never calcu-
late the degree of this complexity (from the fact that all barbarous nations show
signs of decadence from a lost civilization), there is no more ground in the case of
the most savage than of the most civilized race, to assume that the existing language
is the original one. In Australia, e. </., the native languages are radically one ; but
this forms no conclusive proof of the unity of the races, in the absence of historical

evidence of this one language having been in primitive times common to them all.
Its diffusion may very possibly be the result of artificial influences of which no re-

cord exists.

    Secondly, in a positive point of view, it was shown that in all the instances above
cited, there had taken place between the races, a close assimilation of (1) Political,

 (2) Religious, (3) Intellectual, or (4) general Social relations, or of any, or all of

these combined ; and it was suggested that it is such an assimilation, and not unity
of race, that unity in language rightly typifies. The principle was applied in detail.
Thus, in Cumberland and Cornwall, the assimilation in language with London was
exhibited as the result of a loss of that national feeling, the permanence of which in
Wales has preserved the provincial Celtic ; and not as the sign of a greater com-
mixture of races in the two former districts than in the last. The community of
language between the Abrahamidae and the Canaanites was referred to their social
intercourse from the time of Abraham's migration into Canaan, until Jacob's descent
 into Egypt. The prevalence of Arabic or Turkish, in countries where Islam is domi-
nant, represented the extent to which the Mahometan conquest has affected the
 habits and institutions of its subjects. The existence of the Neo-Latin languages

was interpreted as a mark of the eagerness of the Roman provincial to obtain the
' civitas,' and with it to adopt the ' Latinitas.' The Teutonic speech which has
                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  151

overwhelmed the Wendish and Prussian languages in North Germany'was the mea-
sure of the military and political force of the Teutonic Order and the " Romische
Reich." The Sclavonic of modern Bulgaria was attributed to the action of that
church of which Cyril and Methodius were the founders ; and the Magyar language
in the Ckomanian districts of Hungary was accounted for by the contented adhesion

of the Ckomans to the Hungarian constitution.
   The sum of the whole was, that it is not safe to infer from affinity between the

language of two nations more than this, that there was a time when there existed
between them civil, religious, or some sort of social relations. Language was the

product and token of a nation's political, moral, or intellectual, but not of its phy-
sical constitution. It would not reveal a people's genealogy, but its mental and

social history. Should it ever be proved that all languages were derived from one
original, the sole valid inference would be, that at some time one sovereign race had

imposed upon all the rest its own political or social institutions, while the great
question of the number of races would remain just where it stood.

A Short Notice of the People of Oiide, and of their leading Characteristics.

                             By H. M. Greenhow.

The Sepoys of the late Bengal army deserve a short notice. Drawn principally

from respectable agricultural families in Oude, they were often the younger sons of
such families. Fine, tall, athletic men, with handsome features generally, and well-
knit frames, they were the very flower of the youth of Oude. Fond of their homes,

--and having occasional furlough even if serving in the distant stations of the Bom-
--bay Presidency, or in Burmah for the purpose of visiting them ; enjoying sufficient

pay, and the prospect of pension after faithful service ; having, too, certain privi-
leges of their own, more especially at the Court of Lucknow, before that Court was

abolished, the Sepoys of Oude were a set of men honoured by their own people and
trusted by their officers. When led in battle by the latter they were brave and faith-

ful ; on the march or in cantonments they were orderly and obedient ; in private
intercourse they were gentle and polite. Ignorant, bigoted, and prejudiced they

always were ; and to ignorance, bigotry, and prejudice may be in a great measure

ascribed the ease with which, in the hour of trial, their ears were opened to the voice
of treason, and they forgot their honour aud their oaths. The author added, that
the treachery and cruelty which seem to be inherent in the Asiatic nature, and which
no extent of education had as yet even modified in the natives of India, showed itself

in the Sepoy character during the late mutiny in an unmistakeable and repulsive
form. The paper gave various details in connexion with the characteristics of Oude

and its inhabitants.  ______

ByOn the Geometrical Projection of two-thirds of the Surface ofthe Sphere.

   CoIonelH. James, i2.i5'.,i''.^.*S^., Superintendent of the Ordnance Survey.

  Two maps were exhibited which were drawn on this projection, and described by

Colonel James. The hemisphere was first projected by Hipparchus 200 years before
Christ, but this is the first time that a geometrical projection of more than a hemi-
sphere has been made. One of the maps exhibited contained the North circumpolar
regions, and all Europe, Asia, Africa, and America ; the other contained the South
polar regions and the Pacific Ocean, with a large portion of North and South Ame-
rica and of Asia. The peculiar advantage of the projection consists in the accurate
representation which it gives of the relative position of all parts of the earth to each
other, an advantage which no other projection possesses, and which cannot be ob-
tained even from the inspection of a globe.

On the General Distribution of the Varieties of Language and Physical Con-

   R. G. Latham, M.D., F.R.S.

   The principle which he held was that, in ethnological investigations, the method

geologist, arguing back from effects to cause, rather than the historian, who trusts
to testimony in preference to facts. He also especially urged that it was important
to bear in mind what was a true principle in zoology and the natural history sciences,
and not to trust too exclusively to one characteristic. He did not, he said, believe
that in ethnology any great discovery would be made, and he thought it was better

not to attempt to give any opinion as to the question of the unity or the non-unity

of the human race.

On the Yang-tse-Keatig and the Hwang-ho, or Yellow River. By William

        LocKHART, FM.G.S. Communicated by Dr. Norton Shaw.

   This river, it appeared, was called by the Chinese "The Girdle of China," and it

traversed the whole of the centre of the empire, rolling its flood of water to the sea,
through the richest and most fertile part of the country. Its importance to China
could not be too highly estimated, and it might be safely asserted that there was no
river in the world which had on its banks so numerous a population, amounting to

at least one hundred millions of people, who were sustained by its waters in the

pursuits of commerce and agriculture. There were more than 100 cities of the first,
second, and third classes, and 200 towns and villages which could be approached
directly from its water-way. From its origin in Tibet to its outlet at the sea, its
course was about 3000 miles, the points being distant in a direct line 1850 miles,
and the basin drained by its channel being nearly 800,000 square miles. The com-
merce of many of the places situate on the borders of the river was very important.

Persons engaged in every variety of trade resorted to Han-Khow for the exchange of
their respective commodities ; men from the north and west, from Mongolia to Tibet

and Sze-chuen, brought their wheat, rice, dried and salted vegetables of every kind,
bamboo sprouts, horses, sheep, furs, skins, coal, lead, jade or nephrite, gold in large
quantities, rhubarb, musk, wax, and various drugs of northern growth, and exchanged
them for tea, silk, camphor, opium, various southern drugs, and above all, for very
large quantities of Manchester and Leeds goods. The quantity of long cloth and

cotton goods that passed through Han-Khow was probably more than half of the

·whole brought to China, and access to this spot was of great importance. It had
long been much desired by merchants that they should be able to inspect personally
the trade of this place and take part in it, as, from the accounts brought by native

--traders, it would appear to be one of the most important if not the most important
-- mart in all Asia. The paper referred to other places situate on the river, and de-

scribed their principal features.

     Extracts from a Letter by Mr. William Russell to the President.

   The President gave some particulars, contained in a letter dated Simla, 24th of
July, which he had received from Mr. William Russell, the well-known correspond-
ent of the Times, confirming the rumours of the death of M. Adolphe Schlagintweit,
at Yarkand. He (the Chairman) regretted to say that there was no longer any doubt
of the death of this adventurous traveller. After penetrating as far as Yarkand,
where no European had ever been before, he was living in the suburbs of that city
at a period when a war broke out between the Yarkandese and the Chinese, and he
was slain by a number of the former, who surrounded his house in the night-time.
Fortunately the chief portion of his papers would be saved, M. Schlagintweit having
left them, before proceeding to Yarkand, at a place within the range of British in-
fluence. His travels were of much importance, as no region so far to the north-
west of India as Yarkand had been previously visited by a European. M. Schlagint-
weit and his two brothers had travelled by the authority and at the expense of the
East India Company. The brothers Hermann and Robert did not penetrate as far
as Yarkand, and had since returned to Europe ; a sketch of their adventurous travels
across the Karakorum and Kuen Luen chains to the North of the Himalaya having
been given by Sir Roderick Murchison in his last Anniversary Address to the Roysd

 Geographical Society.

   The communications alluded principally to the investigation which had heen made
with a view of forming a communication through tlie British dominions. The

reports considered it very important that a route should be established through the
British territory, for the encouragement of emigration, and the transport of the future

produce from Red River and the Great Western plains to Canada. The Canadian
Government had offered £5000 for the establishment of a route between Lake Supe-
rior and Red River, and an engineering party had already commenced a portion of it.

On the Geography of British North America, more particularly British
   Columbia, Frazer River, Sfc. By Norton Shaw, M.D., Secretary

   to the Royal Geographical Society of London.

   Dr. Shaw gave an account of the various discoveries which have been made in North
America, alluding minutely to those made prior to, as well as since the cession of
Canada by France to Great Britain in the year 1763, and then proceeded to describe

the geographical position of the Frazer River, the boundaries and limits of British
North America, the mountains of the coast, called the Cascade Mountains ; the

Rocky Mountains, and British Columbia. He attributed the earlier exploration of

the interior to the French, rather than to the English settlers, the latter having con-

fined their attention chiefly to agricultural pursuits. Dr. Shaw then referred to the
rewards offered by Parliament for the discovery of a north-west passage, and to the
explorations made by an organized association of the traders of Canada, under the
name of the " North-West Company," whose right of trading they had not un-
reasonably supposed to be independent of the Charter of the Hudson Bay Company,
since it had existed before the cession of Canada to England. Speaking of British
Columbia, he said that the face of the country presented a succession of mountain
ridges, valleys, and plains, the more fertile districts lying, for the most part, between
the Cascade Mountains and the Pacitic. That portion of the country which lay be-
tween the Cascade Mountains and the Pacific was subject to a remarkably equal tempe-
rature, the mean being about 54" Fahr. There was only about four months of winter,

and all fruits and vegetables were as early as in Canada. In several respects the climate
of the middle section was less favourable : it was subject to droughts, and was warmer
in summer and colder in winter. The air, however, was pure and healthy. The
 eastern section, amid the snows of the Rocky Mountains, could not be praised for
its climate. The western section was well adapted for agricultural and horticultural
operations. The middle section was favourably mentioned ; and in the course of his

remarks about the Frazer River, Dr. Shaw stated that it abounded in fish, as also did

the other rivers in the district. Geese, ducks, and water fowl were plentiful in the
spring and summer. In the eastern section of the country wild animals of various
kinds were met with in great numbers. After having mentioned the auriferous

deposits lately discovered on the Frazer River, Dr. Shaw dilated upon the probable
communication by water and rail through British North America via the Passes of
the Rocky Mountains, connecting thus in future the dense populations of Western

Europe with those of Eastern Asia.

                         By M. I. Joseph Silbermann.

    The merit claimed for M, Silbermann 's invention was, that by it globes could be
made more cheaply, rapidly, and accurately than upon the usual plan. Two copper
 hemispheres are employed, in which small globes are cast entire, and large ones by
partially filling them with a kind of pulp, and introducing an India rubber bag, which
is inflated by powerful pressure ; and in that way the pulp is forced into the crevices

 of the mould.

      On the Lacustrine Homes of the Ancient Swiss. Bij M. TroyoS.

   The object of the paper was to direct attention to the remains of ancient cabins or
houses huilt on piles on the banks and in many of the lakes of Switzerland. These
dwelling-places had been erected so that thej' might be surrounded by water as a pro-
tection from wild beasts and the enemies of the inhabitants. Remains of flint arrow-
heads, stone axes, flint knives, and other rude articles were found, and were some
indication of the state of civilization and knowledge to which the inhabitants had

attained.

On the Formation of a Raihoay from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean,

  through the British Possessions of North America. By A. Whitney, of

   Neto York.

The writer commenced his paper by explaining at some length the reasons why

he was convinced that the United States would never attempt the construction of

any such line of railway, and then observed that, had his plan been adopted, the

work could have been commenced on the western shore of Lake Michigan, where

there were timber, materials, and easy communication with settlement and civili-

zation, and everything to facilitate settlement on its line the lines : to connect with

it from the Atlantic, passing through but two States, could from necessity have

been made tributary to its operation and management from the Lake to the Pacific.

Congress then had power over it, and all the streams could have been bridged

so that an uninterrupted communication from ocean to ocean would have been

Afor ever after.  cargo of merchandise could have passed from the Atlantic to the

Pacific without transhipment, and as the road from the Lake to the Pacific would

have been free, except tolls necessary for operations and repairs, the charge for

transit would have been so low, together with the great saving in time, that the

commerce of Europe with Asia would have been forced over it. This was now all

lost to the United States. The author of the paper continued by saying, he had

never believed that a railroad to the Pacific could ultimately benefit either Europe or

the Atlantic slope of America, unless the commerce of Europe with Asia could be

made to pass over it, leaving England with her present manufacturing and commer-

cial position and relations, and augmenting her power over both. The immense

business which the commerce and intercourse between Europe and Asia would give

to the road must, as a natural result, form a foundation for the employment of a

densely populated belt from ocean to ocean, and as far as the soil and climate might

suit, mostly an agricultural people. This belt would take the surplus population

from Europe, and make the producers of food to exchange for English manufactures

on one side and Asiatic products on the other, thus benefiting to a vast extent the

population of both Europe and Asia, by giving to each the means to consume more

largely of the other's products. If these great results could not be attained, what

benefit to England, or to the United States even, could be looked for from a railroad

to the Pacific? "When he was last in England (in 1851) he found many warm

advocates for the construction of a railway over British territory. It was then, as

now, his firm belief that this work could not be accomplished through a wilderness

80 vast, except by a system of settlement and civilization to be connected with the
TRANSACTIONS OF THK SECTIONS.  155

work. He then found that on a line so far north the climate and lands would not

be as well suited to settlement and culture as further south, on territory of the
United States ; but he had since examined the subject more thoroughly, and found
a large extent of country on the British side well adapted to settlement and culture.
At the Selkirk settlement, further north even than necessary for the line of the road,
wheat, rye, barley, oats, potatoes, and even Indian corn, were cultivated to perfec-
tion, the yield large and grain fine, and almost the entire line on this side would be
a good grass country. The Pacific side for some parallels was 10° milder. The
British side was far the most favourable for constructing a railroad with much lower
grades. From Lake Superior to the Rocky Mountain Range was almost a level
country. Near 50° parallel the stream divided, running north-easterly and south-
easterly, and north of 45° parallel the mountains sloped to the Arctic Ocean, and
nowhere north of 50° did they elevate their peaks above 5500 feet, with many de-

pressions practicable for a railway. Was not this, then, the route for the commerce

between Europe and Asia? Mr. Whitney pointed out that there was excellent
harbour accommodation at Halifax, on the Atlantic side, and Puget Sound on the
Pacific side, and observed that these two places would form excellent depots for the
commerce of Europe, Asia, the American continent, and indeed the whole world.

A cargo of merchandise might then pass from the Atlantic to the Pacific without

transhipment or delay, and the actual distance from England to China was some 2000
miles less than any route likely to be fixed upon by the United States. Panama
Railway and the projected railway across Mexico were truly great enterprises, but

people were mistaken as to their probable results. They would certainly facilitate

travel and intercourse with California, Oregon, and the Sandwich Islands, but not
so with Australia, the other islands, China, and India ; because the sailing distance
from England and Australia, China, India, &c., was less round the Cape of Good
Hope than via Panama. The distance from Canton to London via the Cape of Good
Hope was 2000 miles less than via Panama. The writer said that the Panama rail-
way had not in any way changed the position of the people of Europe or Asia, nor
in any way given to each the means of consuming more of the other's products.
The result of it, however, he believed would inevitably be the hastening of the great
changes consequent upon the encircling of the globe with civilization and Christi-
 anity, and building upon the Pacific slope a nation which must control the com-
merce of all Asia. Let England, then, he concluded by urging, put forth her whole

strength and build a great highway for the world over her own soil. It could be

 accomplished in ten or fifteen years, and, with modifications, on the plan proposed
 by him to the United States. It could be accomplished nominally without outlay of
 money by the nation, creating by its connexion with the settlement of its line the

means for its own construction : it would add millions 'of wealth to the nation,
 and give to it the control, not only of the commerce of all Asia, but of that of the
 world also. With steam, the distance from London to China could then be per-

 formed in twenty-eight days; merchandise even could be taken in thirty or thirty-

 five days.

           Notes on the Physical Geography/ of North-Western Australia.

 By J. S. Wilson, Geologist to the North- Western Australian Expedition.

   The paper described the climate of that part of Australia as being hot for six
months in the year, but not injurious to health. The country, it said, was fertile,
and a large variety of luxurious grasses was found growing, one species of which
was a kind of wild oats, from 3 to 6 feet high. The indigenous plants were more
numerous and superior to those of Southern Australia. The characteristics of the
natives were similar to those of the aborigines of the south of the country, and the
writer was glad to say that, in Lower Victoria, at all events, there was no unfavour-
able impression upon the minds of the native population against the settlement of

the English.

On the General and Gradual Desiccation of the Earth and Atmosphere,
                         By J. Spotswood Wilson.

The writer drew attention to the fact, that those who had travelled in continental
 --l56 REPORT 1858.

  lands, especially in or near the tropics, had been forced to reflect on the changes of
  climate that appeared to have occurred. There were parched and barren lands, dry

  river channels, and vsraterless lakes, and not unfrequently traces of ancient human
 habitations, where large populations had been supported, but where all was now
 desolate, drj', and barren. He had been first led to a consideration of the subject by
 phenomena of this nature that had come under his own observation, particularly in
  Australia, and he soon discovered that desiccation, so very observable there, was

  too extensive and permanent to be explained by occurrences of an irregular nature.
  Remembering also that similar appearances had been observed in other parts of the
  vvorld, for which no satisfactory cause was assigned, he had collected the observa-
  tions of travellers in regard to various countries, and endeavoured, by the evidence
  they afforded in the failing of the water systems, to establish the theory of a general
  and continuous decline of the humidity supported by the atmosphere, and then to
 discover in the operation of some law of our terrestrial system the cause of desicca-
 tion in both land and atmosphere. After quoting largely from the works of various

 travellers and writers (amongst the latest of whom were Dr. Livingstone), and

 giving interesting descriptions of dried-up rivers and desolated tracts of country in
 Australia, Africa, Mexico, and Peru, which had formerly been inhabited by man,

 Mr. Wilson proceeded to give his own theory as to the cause of this desiccation, con-

 tending that the upheaval of the land, the waste by irrigation, and the destruction
 of forests, all of which had been put forward as the cause, were insufficient to

 account for what had been described. He remarked that the amount of aqueous

 vapours that can be borne by the atmosphere at any time must be in proportion to
 the mass of the atmosphere itself, from which it followed that a reduction in the
 mass of the atmosphere would produce a corresponding decline in the amount of
 hydrous vapours absorbed and supported. If, therefore, a physical operation, in-
 volving a waste of the atmosphere, could be discovered, it might be concluded that
 at least one cause had been found for its declining humidity. Agreeably with these
 conditions, it was learnt that a vast amount of the atmosphere, and of the ocean like-
 wise, had been solidified. The rocks, in the history of their own formation, bore
 witness to the tendency to transmutation in the character of both. The elements of
 water were hydrogen and oxygen, and the atmosphere was composed of oxygen,
 nitrogen, and carbonic acid, in which hydrous vapours mingled in varying quantities,
 all of which had entered largely into the formation of rocks and minerals. The coal
plants had absorbed largely all the elements of air and water, but particularly of
 carbon, of which coal contains on an average from 80 to 90 per cent. Carbon united
with oxygen formed carbonic acid, which, combined with lime and solidified, formed
more than two-fifths of all limestone rocks. Oxygen was said to form half of what
is known of the material of the globe. Besides existing in air and water, it formed
a part of most earthy substances, and of nearly all the productions of the animal
and vegetable kingdom. The oxygen of the atmosphere was also gradually absorbed
by all animal and vegetable productions, and by almost all mineral masses exposed
to the open air. From such facts as he had adduced and others he could produce,
Mr. Wilson concluded that there was a gradual solidifying of the atmosphere and
water on the face of this terrestrial world, which he inferred was, in the usual course
of geological changes, slowly approaching a state in which it will be impossible for

man to continue an inhabitant ; and remarked that as inferior races preceded man

and enjoyed existence before the earth had arrived at a state suitable to his consti-

tution, it is more than probable others will succeed him when the conditions neces-

sary for his existence have passed away.

      Notice of the Opening of a Sepulchral Tumulus in East Yorkshire.

                             By Thomas Wright, M.A.

    Setting aside the vague speculations on a pre-Celtic population of the island, the

first Roman known to have visited it, Julius Cffisar, who appears to have been

personally acquainted only with the latter settlers in the maritime district of the

south-east, informs us that the interior was inhabited by a people much inferior
in cultivation, who were reputed to be the original inhabitants of the island. This
people, we learn from later writers, were called the Brigantes, who held a very

large portion of the interior of Britain, including the whole of Yorkshire. There
·were Brigantes also in Ireland, and Mr. Wright adduced arguments to show

that the British population of Yorkshire belonged probably to the Gaelic branch of

the Celtic race, and not to the Cymric. He described what were known of the
peculiar characteristics of this British population of the Roman occupation of Bri-

tain, and of the establishment of the Anglo-Saxons, and he pointed out the interest-

ing characteristics of many of the supposed British interments in East Yorkshire, as

belonging, he suspected, to the period of the independence of the British towns pre-

ceding the Saxon invasion.

He then read an account of the opening of an ancient sepulchral tumulus in the

Atownship of Bridlington, by Mr. Edward Tindall of that place.  skeleton was

found, laid on its back, in a trench or grave cut in the chalk, with a rude urn which

had been turned on the lathe. A flint spear-head was found, according to the de-

scription, in the skull, as though it had penetrated from the back of the neck to the

jaw. Mr. Wright concluded by pointing out circumstances in this interment which

were rather of a Teutonic character, than Celtic or Roman.

STATISTICAL SCIENCE.

Address by the President, Edward Baines, Esq., on opening the Section.

If the Biiiish Association were a theatre for intellectual display, I should shrink

from occupying a chair in which I have had such distinguished predecessors. But if

I understand the spirit of this Association, it is the simple, honest, earnest pursuit of

truth ; first, of truth in facts, and secondly, of truth in principles ; and it would be

quite foreign to that spirit either to attempt anything of display or to apologize for

its absence. I shall be permitted, however, to welcome the disciples of economical

and statistical science on their visit to this important centre of industry, where prac-

tical illustrations may be found of many branches of their subject, and where, I hope,
there are many who can value their inquiries. After the remarks made last night by
the President of the Association, it may seem superfluous to say anything further on

the claims of that science which he pronounced to " bear more immediately than any

Weothers on the prosperity of nations and the well-being of mankind."  must all

have felt how unanswerably the President proved the value of economical and statis-

tical science, when he referred to the department of vital statistics, and showed what

terrific losses had been sustained by our army and navy and the army of France, from

the neglect of sanitary rules. But I may just remark that what gave to the recent

report of Mr. Sidney Herbert's commission on the health of our troops in barracks its

resistless force, was the certainty and precision with which statistical researches

enabled it to measure the amount of loss sustained, by comparison with the mortality

in other classes of the population at the same ages. The report might have dwelt on

sickness, on injudicious diet, on defective ventilation, on want of drainage, and so

forth, and all such statements would have been pronounced to he exaggerations or
errors ; but when it applied the ascertained scale of mortality so as to prove that there

were so many deaths in the thousand when there ought only to have been half that

number, the definiteness of the figures and facts defied evasion, fastened on the public

mind and conscience, and compelled immediate measures of reform. Those persons
who have ignorantly charged upon political economy and statistics a disregard of

moral considerations and of humanity, may now see how egregiously they were mis-
taken, and how the arithmetic which they thought so heartless is rising up as the
most powerful advocate of the value of human life, of health, of domestic comfort, of

temperance, of virtue, of proper leisure, of education, and of all that can purify and

elevate society. I am glad to know that we shall have one or more papers on im-

portant points of vital statistics laid before this meeting. May I for a moment refer

to another reproach thrown upon statistics, namely, that they may be so used as to

prove anything ? I hardly need say that it is unfair to argue from the abuse of a thing

against its proper use. But it may be admitted, that there is sufficient ground for
                                              !

--iSS REPORT 1858.

this reproach, in the negligent or dishonest use sometimes made of statistics, to call

upon us for the exercise of great caution, so that in the first place we may be slire we

have got all the facts that are essentia], and in the next place that we draw from them

sound and accurate conclusions. The statist ought to remember how liable are loose

and defective masses of figures to be used by both sides in controversy, each picking

up such as suit him wherewith to pelt his antagonist. It is valuable to collect facts,

but it is still more useful to ascertain that they are exact and complete, and then so

Ato arrange them that they may serve to build up some useful structure.  statist

ought to lay a charge upon his conscience, as though he were sworn in the form of

our old oath to speak "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." Nor

can we be too careful to reason fairly and soundly from the facts we may amass ; for

it is the facts of the statist and the doctrines founded upon them by the economist,

which, to a great extent, guide our practical legislation, and thus affect the great in-

myterests of society. I cannot refrain from expressing  conviction, that as the science

we cultivate has been shown to be favourable to humanity, so it is no less favourable

to freedom. Within the last quarter of a century how busy has it been in knocking

off all sorts of fetters from human energies

    It is, indeed, opposed by the interests which restrictions have created, sometimes
manufacturing, sometimes agricultural ; but in England at least its march in the path

of freedom has been rapid and steady ; and we may say of it, vestigia nulla retror-

sum.

 On the Woollen Manufacture of England, with special reference to tJie Leeds
                    Clothing District. By Edward Baines.

    The author commenced his paper by observing that it was suitable, when the British
Association honoured Leeds with a visit, that its members should receive some account
 of the great branch of manufacturing industry of which Leeds was the ancient seat,
and which prevailed here on a larger scale than in any other part of England or of
the world. It was peculiarly desirable that such an account should be rendered to

this Section, because, notwithstanding the antiquity of the manufacture, its economy and
statistics were by no means well ascertained. Though a large part of the raw mate^
rial was grown at home, we had absolutely no reliable statistics of the amount of this
famous product of the British Isles. It was hoped, therefore, that the present attempt

to ascertain the facts connected with the woollen manufacture might not bewithout
its use; and also that it might derive some additional interest from indicating re-
markable modern changes in this department of industry, and explaining some pecu-
liarities which at first sight perplexed the political economist. The woollen manufac-
ture of Yorkshire was prosperous and advancing ; but it could not fail to have been

noticed that its progress was less rapid and extraordinary than that of other textile
manufactures; and it might be well to show that this was to be ascribed to circum-

stances inherent in the nature of the iiibric, and not to indifference and apathy on the
part of those engaged in this branch of industry. The difference between the
woollen and the worsted fabrics consisted chiefly in the woollen yarn being very

slightly twisted, so as to leave the fibres at liberty for the process of felting, whilst the

worsted yarn was hard spun and made into a much stronger thread. The feebleness
of the woollen yarn made it more difficult to be woven by the power-loom than either
Worsted, cotton, linen, or silk, none of which was susceptible of being felted. The
processes of the Woollen manufacture are more numerous and complex than those of any
other of our textile manufactures, and are performed by a much greater variety of ma-

chines and of workpeople. It was prett}' obvious, the author remarked, that there must
be proportionate difficulty in effecting improvements which would tell materially on the
quantity or the price of the goods produced. There was still another fiict which re-
tarded the advance of the woollen as compared with other manufactures, namely, the
higher price of the raw material, wool being about three times the market price of
cotton and flax. Nor could sheep's wool be augmented in quantity so rapidly as raw
materials which merely required the cultivation of the soil. But the economist might

inquire how is it that the worsted manufacture has of late years increased so much
more rapidly than the woollen, seeing that it uses the same raw material, sheep's
wool ? It was to be ascribed in part to very remarkable improvements made within
--

these few years in the process of combing, which was now performed by machinery

--instead of by hand, and the cost of the process reduced almost to nothing, in part to
--the greater simplicity of the other processes, admitting of their being carried on almost

entirely in large factories, but more than all to the introduction of cotton warps into
the manufacture, which had not only cheapened the raw material, but had introduced
a vast variety of new descriptions of goods, light, beautiful, cheap, and adapted both
for dress and furniture. According to the last Factory Return made by the Factory

Inspectors in ISrjG, and printed by the House of Commons in 18.57, there were in
Yorkshire 445 worsted factories and 806 woollen factories ; but the number of opera-
tives was 78,994 in the former, and only 42,982 in the latter. The average number

of operatives in the worsted factories, therefore, was 177, whilst in the woollen facto-
ries it was only 53. The whole number of operatives returned in the census of 1851,
as employed in these two manufactures in the county of York, was 97,147 in the
worsted manufacture, and 81,128 in the woollen. Fom--fifths of all the hands em-
ployed in the worsted trade were in factories, whilst only about half of those in the
woollen trade were in factories. Everything tended to show that the worsted ma-
nufacture, like those of cotton and linen, had become an employment carried on
by the machinery of large factories ; and as mechanical improvements were con*
stantly speeding the power-loom and the spindle, so that in worsted factories the
power-loom had increased 67 per cent, in speed within the last ten years, and the
spindle 114 per cent., manufactures thus situated must advance more rapidly than
those which, like the woollen, were more dependent on manual labour. The woollen

manufacture was surpassed in extent by the cotton manufacture at the beginning of
the present century. It still held the second place in regard to the number of opera-
tives employed, though not to the number employed in factories, in which it was sur-
passed both by the worsted and the flax or linen trades. In the woollen mills, between
1838 and 185G, the number of operatives increased 44 per cent., the horse-power
employed increased 25 per cent., and the number of power-looms increased 572 per
cent. ; but still the other manufactures advanced with greater strides in almost all
these respects. The author next referred to the sources from which the raw material,
sheep's wool, is drawn, and to the remarkable changes which the present century has
witnessed with regard to it. The wool was English, foreign, and colonial, and came
from all quarters of the globe. Our largest supply was from the United Kingdom,
but nearly half of the domestic wools was consumed in the worsted manufacture, and

the other half was used for the lower kinds of woollen goods. Within living memory
Yorkshire cloth was made exclusively of English wool, though Spanish wool had long
been used for the finer cloths of the West of England. Now, however, English wool,
from its comparative coarseness, was entirely disused in the making of broad-cloth.

In the last half of the 18th century the import of foreign wool fluctuated from a little
under to a little over two million pounds weight a year. In 1799 it was 2,263,606 lbs.

But in the year 1 857 the quantity of foreign and colonial wool imported was 127,390,885
lbs., of which 90,903,666 lbs. was retained for home consumption. As the exports of
woollen goods did not increase in any proportion whatever to these figures, it was
evident that the character of the cloth, both that worn at home and that exported,
must have changed by the substitution of foreign and colonial for English wool. The
foreign wool first used when this improvement in the quality of the cloth began, was
that of Spain, the native country of the merino sheep. The total import of wool
sprang up suddenly from 2,263,666 lbs. in the year 1799, to 8,609,368 lbs. in 1800;
and of the latter quantity, 6,062,824 lbs., or more than two- thirds, was Spanish. After
the French invasion of Spain and the long Peninsular wars, the quality of Spanish
wool degenerated, and the quantity fell off; and its place in our manufacture was
gradually filled by the wool of Saxony and Silesia, into which country the merino

breed of sheep had been introduced in 1765. The German wool was still by much

the finest used in any country; but as the merino flocks were introduced by Mr.
Macarthur into our great Australian colonies, and were found to increase there immensely
without any very great degeneracy in the quality of the fleece, German wool had in
its turn to a very considerable extent been superseded by Australian. The following
Table showed the imports and exports of foreign and colonial wool, at intervals of
 about ten years, for the last century :
160 REPORT 1858.

woollen and worsted manufacturers, whilst the quantity exported in 1857wasl5, 142,881
lbs., making an aggregate of 175,142,881 lbs. of English wool. The exports of
English wool, both in tiie raw state and in the first stage of manufacture, namely,
yarn, were great and rapidly increasing. Thus the farmer was deriving benefit from
the freedom of trade, and English wool was resuming its flow through channels which
legislation had closed for five centuries. It was for our manufacturers to take care
that no other country made a better use of their native raw material than themselves.

   The author then glanced at the history of this ancient manufacture up to our own

times, and observed that they ought not in that Association and in that Section to
withhold the honour due to the high intelligence, manly spirit, and wonderful disin-
terestedness of Lord Milton, afterwards Earl Fitzwilliam, who, whilst representing

the great seat of the woollen manufacture, Yorkshire, advocated the removal of pro-
tection from the manufacturers, and, although one of the largest landowners, contended
for the removal of protection from agriculture. It was a matter of just pride for this
Association and for Yorkshire to remember that that enlightened and high-minded

nobleman was the first president of the British Association. The woollen manufac-
ture, in its various branches, was very extensively diffused. According to the last

Factory Iletiu-n, it prevailed in twenty-two counties of England, ten of Wales, twenty-

four of Scotland, and six of Ireland. More than one-half of the operatives employed

in the woollen factories were in the county of York, namely, 42,992 out of 79,081.

The worsted manufacture, on the other hand, though for some centuries it had its
chief seat in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, had now obtained a remarkable concentra-
tion in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Out of 87,994 factory operatives in the worsted
trade of the United Kingdom, 78,994 were in Yorkshire. The chief seat of the ma-
nufacture of superfine broad-cloth had for centuries been, and still was, the West of
England, and especially the counties of Gloucester and Wilts. The population, and
doubtless also the trade of the West Riding of Yorkshire, had increased much more
rapidly both in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries than those of Gloucestershire,
Wiltshire, and Norfolk. Between the years 1801 and 1851 the population of Leeds
increased 224 per cent. ; Bradford 682 per cent. ; Huddersfield 325 per cent. ; Halifax
179 per cent. ; and Norwich 88 per cent. The author apprehended that the principal
advantages of the West Riding over Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, and Norfolk consisted,
first, in the greater cheapness of coal and iron; secondly, in the larger body of raea
skilled in the making and working of machinery ; and thirdly, in the facility of access
to the great ports of Liverpool and Hull. But he inclined to think that the mere fact
of Yorkshire having devoted itself to the manufacture of cheap goods had been as
influential as any other cause.

of our exports to foreign countries. The earlier tables made no distinction between
the woollen and worsted goods exported, and the later tables made the distinction
imperfectly. Up to the year 1815 we had only the official value of the exports, which,
however, probably did not vary much from the real value; from 1815 downwards we
had the real or declared value. Before the year 1820 also, the tables included the ex-
ports to Ireland, though this fact was overlooked by most writers on the subject.

   The experienced eye would see at a glance how for the last ninety years the natural
progress of the woollen manufacture had been checked by the introduction of the
cheaper material, cotton, and the unparalleled extension of its manufactures ; of which
we last year exported to the value of £29,597,316 manufactured goods and £8,691,853
yarn, making a total of .^38/289,169.

the number of persons employed, the census of IS.'Jl made an npproach to tlie truth,
and was tbo best evidence wc had ; but it was not altogether trustwortliy. He was
disposed to think that we miglit estimate the earnings of each person employed in the

worsted manufacture two-and-a-half; and at this rate the numbers supported in the

    It must also be remarked that a larger proportion of persons in auxiliary occupations
was connected with the manufactures of wool than with any other textile manufacture,
owing to more than one-half of the raw material being raised at home, whilst the cotton
and silk were wholly dependent on importation, and the linen almost wholly. The
wages earned by the operatives in the woollen manufactui-e were good, and such as
must afford the means of great comfort to their families, besides indicating a pros-

perous condition of the trade. He had been favoured with several tables of wages
from houses of eminence in this neighbourhood, and he had the pleasure to know

that they would be received by the statist as of great value. The following general

statement might be received with entire confidence :

   He felt justified in estimating the wages of operatives in the woollen manufacture

at not less than 12*. Gd. per week on the average for men, women, and children ; and
this for 150,000 workers, would give an aggregate of £-1,875,000 per annum, Mr.
Baines then explained some circumstances relative to the Leeds clothing district,
especially the great quantity of low woollens made in the Batley district, chiefly from
shoddy or mungo, which was wool made from tearing up woollen rags and also from

the waste of the woollen mills. He said that in drawing to a conclusion he must

endeavour to estimate the annual value of the woollen manufacture of the kingdom.
Uncertain as were several of the important elements in the calculation, he felt con-
siderable confidence, arising out of the abundance of the materials before him, the care
with which he had tested them, and the coincidence of several methods of calculation
in bringing about the same result. The constituent parts of the value of the woollens
manufactured in the United Kingdom were, 1st., the value of the raw material; 2nd,
the value of other articles essential to the manufacture; 3rd, the wages paid to the
workpeople; and 4th, the sum left to the cajiitalist for rent, repairs, wear and tear of
machinery, intei'est of capital, and profit. His estimate was as follows :

   He would only, in conclusion, recommend the members of the British Association

to inspect the Exhibition of Local Industry now open in this town, where they would
be able in some measure to judge of the industry and skill of our manufacturers ; and
would express a hope that those manufacturers would never rest satisfied with any
position they might have attained, but, stimulated and warned by what they had seen
in the Great Exhibitions of London and Paris, would remember that they only held

their prosperity on the condition of unceasing improvement.

On the Rate of Mortality in the Metropolitan Improved Dwellings for the

            Industrial Classes. By Joseph Bateman, LL.D.

     On the Sanitary and Industrial Economy of the Borough of Leeds.

                       By R. Baker, Factory Inspector.

    In the year 1080, Leeds proper was a farming village, with an estimated population

of somewhat less than 300, including 27 villeins and four soke men ; and the manor

consisted of about 1000 acres. In 1081, it had a priest, a church, and a mill, of the
yearly value of 4s., and ten acres of meadow. In 1858, it has a population of 112,945
souls, engaged in more varied works than, perhaps, those of any other town in the
kingdom. Bede, in 735, calls Leeds, Leodys, and the Domesday Survey, Leedes
and Thoresby says it was one of the 28 cities of ancient Britain mentioned by

--Nennius, and called the city of " Loid in the Wood." The out-townships, as they

are called, are said to derive their names: 1st. Hunslet, from "Hunde"adog,
and " Slet" a house, because of the number of dogs which were formerly kept there.

Its population is employed in the manufacture of flax, woollens, iron, glass, wire, glue.
                  TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  165

earthenware, chemicals, locomotive engines, carriages, steam-boilers, and the getting
of coal. 2nd. Holbeck derives its name from the Saxon word " Hoi," a low place,
and " beck," or the brook which flows through it. It is described by a recent liisto-
rian, as " one of the most crowded, one of the most filthy, one of the most unpleasant,
and one of the most unhealthy villages of the county of York." But still, the de-
scription which this historian gives is greatly exaggerated. Holbeck is, and Hunslet
is nearly now, united to Leeds in unbroken continuity. It possesses a large supply

of sulphureous water, once celebrated for medicinal virtues, but now required for and
applied to manufacturing purposes. Its population is employed in the manufacture
of Uax machines, and woollens. 3rd. Bramley.-- Its population is mainly employed
in the woollen manufacture, agriculture, and the getting of the celebrated Bramley

Fall stone of millstone grit. 4th. Wortley, situated about a mile from Leeds, is said

to derive its name from its herbage. Armley, from one "Arm" or "Orm," and

"ley," a field. 5th. Headingley, from "Hedde" a Dane, "ing," a patronymic

added to his fathers, and "ley," a field. Headingley-with-Burley is full of the
suburban residences of our merchants and manufacturers ; whilst Kirkstall, which
forms part of the same township, contains woollen, worsted, and flax factories. There
is, just without the borough, and at a short distynce from the Abbey, one of the largest
iron forges of the neighbourhood, which in Thoresby's time (1658) was so extensive,
that he declared it might serve Vulcan and his Cyclops to work in. The fulling-mills

of Armley and Kirkstall are perhaps the most ancient in this part of Yorkshire. 6th.
Chapel-Allerton, two miles from Leeds (north), is said to derive its name from four
adjoining hamlets, called the Alder hills. It is mainly composed of suburban resi-

dences. Its poor population is employed in agriculture and the getting of stone.

7th. Beeston, two miles and a-half from Leeds, though now an agricultural and

mining village, was once celebrated for the manufacture of bone, lace, and straw hats.
Coal mines have long been worked here, and iron is also now obtained of a peculiarly
fine quality. 8th. Farnley, about two miles from Leeds, derives its name from the
ferns which formerly grew here in great abundance, and which to this day flourish in

many parts of it. Its population is employed in the woollen manufacture, the get-

ting of coal of rather an inferior quality, of clay, particularly for sanitary pipes, and

in the manufacture of iron. 9th. Potternewton, about two miles from Leeds (north),

is said to derive its name from its being a new town, in which potteries and brick
kilns existed, contiguous to a Roman station. It possesses many suburban resi-

dences; its industrial population is mainly employed in agriculture and getting of stone.

Of the remaining small hamlets within the borough there is not much to be said.

Their populations amount to 237, who are mainly employed in iron and coal mines,

and in agriculture. For municipal purposes these out-townships are divided into

wards, which send representatives to the Borough Council chamber. In the following

Table the superficial area in statute acres and the population in each ward are given.

 Leeds proper is also divided into wards, the superficial area of each of which is also

 given in statute acres, in order that both within and without the town the density of

the population upon the acre may be seen. Thus, for instance, in the out-townships :--

by which we gather, that, of late years, tlie tide of population in Leeds has steadily
flowed towards improved ventilation and surface condition : since the increases in seven
years, from 1S51 to 1858, in the West and North-west Wards, exceed the per centage
decennial increases of the ten years between 1841. and 18;)1. Tliere lias been a gra-
dual decrease in the number of inhabitants in the Mill Hill Ward, which is in the

centre of the town, and mainly composed of wide and well-ventilated streets; but

here the population has given way to warehouses, shops, and offices. And in the

Kirkgatc Ward there has also been a continued decrease which we can understand;

for though it is also in the centre of the town, as it were, and mainly occupied by

shops and warehouses, yet its dense courts and yards lie contiguous to a river, which,

though a trout stream within the last seventy years, having footways clothed with

avenues of trees, is now nothing but an open sewer, containing the sewerage of Brad-

ford, Shipley, and all the mills, houses, dyehouscs, tanneries, and workshops, which
crowd its western banks ; and cannot, therefore, be healthy or pleasant to those who

have not the means of removing elsewhere. AVc see, in fact, towards the less densely

populated wards, a gradual movement made from the old localities, as well as a steady

increase of a new population. Mr. Baker proceeded to exhibit the diminution in the

rate of mortality resulting from the sanitary improvements effected by the Local Im-

provement Act and the Burial y\ct. In the north districts, for example, in the seven

years from 18r)l to 18.58 the deaths decreased 25 per cent., the population meanwhile

increasing in density, and the ratio of births to the population remaining the same.

So also in the south-east district, with an increased population, the deaths decreased

16 per cent., and in the west district the mortality diminished 5 per cent. He con-

sidered that other ameliorating influences had been at work within the period in

(juestion, such as compulsory vaccination, the decrease of cellar occupancies, emigra-

tion to better-ventilated districts, improved regulations as to hours of labour, improved

wages, temperance societies, a higher social and intellectual state brought about by

lectures, cheap publications, and institutes for mutual improvement, all of which re-

medial elements Leeds possesses in an eminent degree. The importance of sanitary

--measures at Leeds could scarcely be over-rated, considering that 18 per cent, only of

all its houses exceed £10 annual rent a fact which showed how largely the popula-

tion was composed of the working classes. Referring to some of the larger trades

conducted in the town proper, he mentioned the following as being the staple :

Woollen, worsted, flax, silk, dyeing, machine-making, leather, paper, tobacco, sanitary

pipe and tire-brick, glass, earthenware, glue, and chemicals, coal, stone, railway ter-

minals, and making garments for exportation. He doubted whether the prevailing

manufacture of Leeds was at the present time woollen, or the fabrication of machinery.

--The interests engaged in the woollen trade were the manufacturer, the finisher, and

the rag-grinder ; and, as illustrative of the condition of this important branch of trade,

he introduced these statistics :

or improvidence of the working population, he said that in 1857 there were relieved
out of the rates 2238 men, 4862 women, .'iG53 children, and 4864 vagrants ; in all
17,437 persons supported out of the savings of the industrious, notwithstanding all

that was done bj' charit)', bj' secret orders, and benefit societies. To his mind this

pauperism was the result of sheer improvidence, and it would have to be dealt willi

by social science. Ho trusted that the day was dawning when morality would be a

lesson taught with labour, and when as a people we might be wiser and better for our
abundant benefits.

  On the Degree of Education of Persons tried at the Middlesex Sessions.

                   By Joseph Bateman, LL.D., F.R.A.S.

   During the year 1856 there were 1717 persons charged with oflTences at these Ses-
sions. Of these, 880 (or more than one half) could not write ; viz. 379 could not
read, and 501 could read but not write. Of these 880 persons who could not write,
579 (out of 1262 committed or bailed, being almost one-half) were males, and 301 (out
of 455, being two- thirds) were females. Besides these, 401 were returned as able to

read and write imperfectly; viz. 74 males and 27 females. On the other hand, there
were 677 out of the 1717 charged (being more than one-third) who were stated to be

able to read and write well; viz. 561 males out of 1262 charged, and 116 females
out of 455 charged, and 18 (all males) reported to possess a superior education.
This amount was so considerable as to give a colour to the opinion which still prevails
to some extent, that the imparting of the mere elements of education does not neces-
sarily improve the morals of the people. But there is one circumstance connected
with these statistics which is usually overlooked, and which it is the chief object

--of the present paper to point out : it is this. Middlesex, to which these returns

relate, is a county in which elementary education is more generally difltused than it is
throughout the country at large. It appears by the Registrar-General's Report that
in 1 854 the proportion of men who, in the metropolis, wrote their names in the Marriage

Register was 88 out of every 100, and the like proportion of women was 79 out of
every 100. It may be inferred therefore that there are in the metropolis only about
12 men in 100, and 21 women in 100 who cannot write; and consequently that the

criminals in that part of the country are not taken from the entire community indis-
criminately, but that full one-half of them are taken from the class of extremely igno-
rant, consisting of one-sixth of the po^mlalion, thus reducing the criminals among the
educated classes to a very small proportion indeed : and, if we confine our observa-

tions to the case of women alone, we shall find that the extremely ignorant class,

--consisting of one-ffth only of the whole female population of the county, furnishes

two-thirds of its female criminals. See Report of Mr. Pashley, Q.C., to the Middle-
sex Magistrates.

                    On the Investments of the Industrial Classes.

                   By Joseph Bateman, LL.D., F.R.A.S.

   The investments of the industrial classes are chiefly made in Friendly Societies and
Savings Banks. The number of friendly societies enrolled and certified, and now in
existence in England and Wales, is about 20,000, and the number of members belong-
ing to them exceeds 2,000,000, with funds exceeding £9,000,000, of which the sum
of £1,431,543 is in English and Welsh savings banks, and the sum of £1,944,991 in-
vested with the Coniiiiissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, making a total
of £3,376,534 so invested. Tlie number of individual depositors in savings banks on
the 29th November, 1857, was 1,241,752, and the sum due to them was £32,984,923.
It thus appears that the members of these societies and depositors in savings banks
possess funds amounting to nearly £42,000,000, and that the average investment of
each member of the friendly societies is £4 10«., and of each depositor in the savings
bank about £26 11«. Zd. It appears that the number of depositors in savings banks
is five times more than the number of persons entitled to dividends on the public
funded debt ; and that of those so entitled to dividends, by far the greater number are
for very small amounts, such as may be supposed to helong to the humbler classes

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

whilst the total number of persons receiving dividends exceeding £4000 per annum
amounted only in the year 1856 to 227 in the United Kingdom. Another class of

investments open to the working classes, but which was too little known to be acted
upon, was the purchase of deferred and other annuities of the Commissioners for the
Reduction of the National Debt, who were empowered to grant such annuities (not
exceeding £30 per annum to one person) on very advantageous terms to the pur-
chaser. The number and value of these annuities purchased up to 5tli January, 1857,

--were immediate, deferred, and life annuities, number 10,804; purchase-money

£2,071,831 18s. l]d.; for terms of years, number 373; purchase-money £53,081
17*. 6d. Referring to the antiquity of friendly societies, it was remarked that Mr.
Kenrick, the learned author of * The Roman Sepulchral Inscriptions,' had shown
that burial clubs were in existence among the Romans, and he had actually discovered
a copy of the rules of such a society inscribed in marble. At the present moment
there were more friendly societies of one kind or another in England and Wales than

were to be found in the whole of the rest of Europe, or perhaps elsewhere. No less

than 26,000 had been established according to law in England and Wales between
1793 and 1857, besides immense numbers of trade societies and "orders," some of

them numbering their members by hundreds of thousands, and many of which no
account was retiu-ned to the Registrar. Of the friendly societies properly so called,
and which had come to the knowledge of the Registrar, there were, as has been said,
20,000, by which, in the aggregate, no less a sum than £1,000,000 per annum was

expended for affording relief in sickness alone. In the year 1857, the friendly societies
in Leeds raised, in round numbers, £25,000, and distributed £20,000. The author
proceeded to notice the various other classes of friendly societies and modes of invest-
ment for the industrial portion of the population ; the recent improvement of the law

relating to those institutions ; and, as another pleasing fact, the increasing confidence

in savings banks, notwithstanding the failure at Rochdale and a few other places

and he expressed a hope that such failures would be prevented in future by the

Government taking upon itself the responsibility of the funds. If the savings laid
out by the working classes in the various other modes besides beneiit societies and
savings banks could be i.jccrtained and added to the sums disclosed by the official
accomits, they would swell the total to a sum that would astonish some persons by its

vastness ; and, though he did not think it would prove that the industrious classes were
all as thoughtful and prudent as they ought to be, it would show that they were not

so thoroughly dissipated and careless as some persons had represented; and they were

entitled to every encouragement and assistance in carrying out their habits of prudence

and economy.

       Trade and Commerce the Auxiliaries of Civilization and Comfort,

                      By T. Bazley, M.P., Manchester.

   Mr. Bazley sketched the rise and progress of the cotton trade, as confirming and
supporting the views enunciated in the title of this paper. In 1758 the imports of
cotton and its consumption by domestic labour might be three millions of pounds
weight for the entire year, but in the present year, a century afterwards, the quantity
consimied would be one thousand millions of pounds, of which the United States sup-
plied three-fifths, the other two-fifths being obtained from the East Indies, South
America, Egypt, and the West Indies. For the last year, by the return made by the
Board of Trade, the exports of cotton manufactures sent to every part of the world
amounted to upwards of thirty-nine million pounds sterling. Hence this large sum
became the agent of payment to a corresponding extent of imports ; but in thus largely
aiding in procuring increased supplies of foreign products, whether in gold, silver,
raw materials, food, wines, sugar, Iruits, or luxuries of distant growth which are re-
ceived into the United Kingdom, there was the satisfaction that our cotton industry
had contributed clothing comforts to the benefit alike of the savage and civilized in
every region of the earth. In this current year the exports of cotton manufactures
would perhaps amount to forty millions value, and the portion left for home consump-
tion might be twenty millions, or equal to \7s. per head for the population of this
country ; but, as the cotton trade of Great Britain is not half its magnitude in the
entire world, including the domestic and semi-domestic manufacture still extensively

carried on in the East, the manufacture of the world at large could not be less than

the annual value of one hundred and forty millions, and therefore this industry afforded

to the world's population 3s. worth each of cotton clothing, or, represented in calico^

fourteen yards per annum for every man, woman, and child in existence. Presuming

the cotton industry of this country to amount to sixty-four millions in value for the

current year, and the cost of the raw material to be twenty-four millions, then the sum

remaining for wages, interest of capital, rent, taxes, fuel, freight, carriage, and other

requisites, would be forty millions. The population employed in this trade exceeds

half a million, and, as every worker is said to be connected in his family with three

non-workers, who depend upon the single worker for subsistence, two millions of peo-

ple are therefore supported by it. Engineers, founders, machine-makers, and other

auxiliary traders employ vast nrunbers of well-paid workmen, who are constantly en-

gaged and sustained at the cost of the capital invested in the constructive department

of the cotton trade hence these further sources of support increase the total number
                                                                                                   ;

of people dependent upon this extraordinary industry. Viewing Lancashire as the

chief seat of this industry, if we refer to its population a hundred years ago, we

find it to have been about 300,000, whilst now it was 2,300,000, making an increase

greatly in excess of any of the old trading and agricultural communities of this or any

other country. After noticing the numerous other places in different counties of Eng-

land and Scotland in which the manufacture of cotton has become the great support

of labour, Mr. Bazley proceeded to discuss the question of increasing the supplies of

the foreign raw material, and urged the importance of opening up new fields for its

cultivation. Africa and Asia could grow more cotton than the most sanguine could

contemplate  the demand  of the  whole world would  ever  require                                    and to  extend its
                                                                                                  ;

production in those two quarters of the globe would be at the same time to extend

civilization and to diffuse the comforts of life. Workpeople, manufacturers, merchants,

statesmen, and philanthropists had all the deepest interest in this vital question,

which hitherto had been shrouded in almost fatal apathy. At liome and abroad the

wonder was that the British East and West Indies bad not supplied the largest por-

tion of the cotton needed in this country. For much of the unproductiveness of those

portions of the British empire misgovernment was responsible. Roused, however, by

the salutary influences of public opinion, the legislature of our country had given to

the East Indies a new existence. No intermediate spoiler would hereafter prevent
the queen and a direct executive from developing the resources of India. An en-

lightened and just policy applied to every British colony woidd yield the benefits of

an extended commerce, blessing, like charity, those who gave and those who received.

Notes on Self-siipporting Dispensaries, with some Statistics of the Coventry

           Provident Dispensary. By Charles H. Bracebridge.

   The statistics of the self-supporting Dispensary at Coventry are offered to this
Section as an example of those institutions projected by Mr. H. L. Smith, of Southam,
Warwickshire, which, when supported by a sufficient number of members, have been
successful. The statistics of that at Northampton are fully as favourable, though not
carried over so long a period ; this latter having been instituted in 1845, and the for-
mer in 1831*. The queen's visit to Warwick gave occasion to the formation of a

Central Society for the pi-omulgation of the principle, to whom application might be
made for information as to rules, books, and other details, by the possession of which

the founders might proceed safely, and without danger of failing in their objects, pro-

vided always the one necessity of all insurance against risks, and sufficient numbers,
be supplied. This little Society was founded at Warwick in July last (1858), the Lord
Lieutenant, the High Sheriff, Lord Warwick, Lord Willoughby, and several magi-
strates and gentlemen of the county, as well as two or three gentlemen from Coventry
and Northampton, being present, and vouching for the working of the Coventry and

--Northampton Dispensaries for more than twenty years. To this Society the follow-

ing towns have already applied for information : Bath, Bradford, Conway, Hereford,
Southend, and Tadcaster. It is called the " Society for promoting the principles of

--Royal Victoria Self-supporting Dispensaries." Honorary Secretary. H. S. Smith,

--Esq., Southam ; Bankers Messrs. Greaves, Greenway, and Smith, Warwick. The

committee meets at the Warwick Arms, at Warwick.
   The advantages to members are, that the Dispensaries are founded on the princi-

l)le of Provident Insurance. Practice is afforded to medical men, and emulation ex-

cited. Many cases, no doubt, are brought under their notice which would otherwise

have been neglected, till too late for remedies to be applied ; to say nothing of the
great facilities afforded by these institutions for obtaining statistics of disease, and of

their tendency to promote sanitary improvements.
   Clubs can be taken in en masse, and cholera cases are attended gratis. The pay-

ments to medical men, when divided by the number of cases, appear to be about \s.

at Northampton, but are considerably higher, about 3s. 'id., at Coventry ; the other

expenses are salaries to Dispenser and a boy, and the purchase of drugs, leeches, and

instruments. The variation arises from calculating attendance on every child in one
instance, and not in the other. In each case the medical men have divided £750*,
[Coventry £\ less, Northampton £1 more,] and are satisfied. The number of visits

made at patients' abodes in severe cases is not mentioned.
   At Coventry each family selects its medical man for the year ; so that it becomes

unnecessary to enter every slight case among the children for a proportional division
among the medical men at the end of the year.

       On the Financial Prospects of British Railways,

           By Samuel Brown, F.R.G.S., F.S.S.

Mr. Brown gave a summary of the leading facts showing the extension and present

position of the railway system of the country. In doing so he confined himself prin-

cipally to the reports presented by Captain Galton to the Board of Trade, which re-

ports bring down the information to the end of 185G. He also quoted from a Par-

liamentary document which has recently appeared, showing that the total amount of

capital and loans for railways in the United Kingdom, authorized by Acts of Parlia-

ment previous to 31st December, 1857, was £387,051,735, of which £7,732,496 was

authorized to be raised by shares and £2,614,316 by loan last year. Previous to the

year 1857, £281,1 14,152 was to be raised by shares and £96,458,773 by loans. On

The companies then retained power to raise £72,194,678 by existing shares, by new
shares, and by loans. £283,957,225 was the amount stated to be expended in the
construction of railway works. The length of line open for traffic on 3 1st December
last was 9447 miles (2681 miles single and 6356 double lines) ; 993 miles of railroad
were being constructed at the end of the year, and 3554 miles of line were authorized,
but not then commenced. The total length of lines for which companies had obtained

powers prior to 31st December, 1857, was stated at 13,562. In reference to the im-
portant consideration of the relative amount of loans, preference and ordinary share

capital, Mr. Brown remarked that it was evident that whatever the state of the money

market, the lowest rate of interest for the time being would always be upon those in-

vestments which afforded the largest margin for the certain payment of the interest

and the repayment of the principal at the periods![agrecd on. Of £308,775,894,

which was the total amount of money raised up to the end of 1856 for the construc-

tion of railways, £77,359,419, or 25 per cent., formed, in the shape of loans, a first

charge on the profits of the companies. At the end of 1857, £78,406,237 out of

£315,147,200, or 24-88 per cent., was similarly advanced. The total profits from all

railways in 1856 appeared to have been £12,277,712, and the interest upon deben-

tures and loans £3,607,072 ; thus leaving a margin of £8,670,640, or 70-62 per cent,

of net profits, to secure the punctual payment of this interest. Under such circum-

stances, what could be the cause that the average rate of interest on loans so secured

should be as high as 4*60 per cent, in 1856, and that in the most favourable year,

1853, it never fell below an average of 4*14 per cent.? What, again, could be

the cause that the rate of interest on these securities had gone on increasing in

successive years till 1856, though the rate of interest on ordinary share capital had

diminished? In 1857 it was true the rate of interest on this class of securities

seemed considerably less, but it was still 4*133 per cent., whilst the i-ate of dividend

on ordinary share capital had increased to 3'579 per cent. Looking at the very lai-ge

surplus which remained, and the ample security thereby afforded for punctual pay-

ment of the interest, there seemed no reason to doubt that such loans should be con-

sidered nearly equal to'government securities. A suggestion had been recently made

that all such bonds and obligations should be made payable to the bearer, and trans-

missible from hand to hand without expense or trouble. The suggestion was well

worthy of notice, and the effect would be, no doubt, to diminish the rate of interest at

which such advances were made, and ultimately this class of loans would probably not

differ much in value, nor fluctuate much more in market price, than the public funds.

A difference of one-half per cent, interest on the existing loans of £78,000,000 would

--amount to £390,000 per annum no mean advantage to the ordinary shareholders.

Passing to the question of the preference shares, Mr. Brown pointed out that in 1857,

if there had been no preference shareholders, but all had shared alike, the average

dividend would have been 3-915 per cent. The truth was, that the raising of money,

either by debentures or preference shares, was a false system, and always acted pre-

judicially to the ordinary shareholders, unless their annual dividejids amounted to, at

least, the same rate per cent, on their capital as they had to give on debentures or

preference shares. After remarking upon questions of the reduction of the vvorking

expenses of railways, the increase of traffic receipts (which, notwithstanding periods

of commercial depression, had made steady progress for several years), Mr. Brown

said, in conclusion, that some of the evils from which railway shareholders were now

suftering, though recognized, could not be remedied. Mr. Stephenson computed that

no less than £14,000,000 had been spent in law proceedings. Yet, for all this, if the

loan, preference and ordinary share capital were considered as one interest, the re-

sults, though falling far short of the expectations entertained, gave no occasion to

Adespair of the future.  net profit of £12,338,586 in 1857 on a capital paid up of

£315,157,258 (share and loan), yielded 3*915 per cent., and was a fair vantage-groimd

for further progress. With a diminution in the rate of interest when the debenture

and preference share capital was better understood, under improved management;

with a revision and a reduction in some of the various sources of expenditure; with

constantly augmenting traffic receipts ; with a cessation of the fatal and senseless

competition which had so long prevailed ; with a tribunal for arbitration which would

save both legal expenses and the reckless opposition of the companies amongst each

other; with more regard to the convenience of the public in the arrangement of the

trains; with more attention to the comfort of third-class passengers; and with some

system to check the construction of unnecessary lines, and to develop the commerce

of districts by officials thoroughly versed in the resources they afforded, there could

be no reason for railway shareholders to give way to despondency, but rather to look

with pride and satisfaction on a branch of commercial enterprise, the capital em-

barked in which fell little short of £400,000,000 sterling, and of which the net profits

on the amount paid up exceeded last year half the interest upon the permanent Na-

tional Debt.
174 REPORT 1858.

On the Laws, according to which a Depreciation of the Precious Metals con-

   sequent upon an Increase of Supply takes place, considered in connexion

  with the Recent Gold Discoveries. By Professor Caiunes.

Prof. Cairnes referred to the discussions occasioned by the recent gold discoveries

as exhibiting, on the part of a large number of those who engage in them, a strange

unwillingness to recognize, amongst the inevitable consequences of those events, a

fall in the value of money. He said a strange unwillingness, because similar doubts

were not found to exist in any corresponding case. With respect to all other com-

modities, it was not denied that whatever facilitated production promoted cheapness,

that less would be given for objects when they could be attained with less trouble and

sacrifice. It was not denied by any one pretending to economic knowledge that the

enlarged production of gold now taking place had a tendency to lower its value; but

--it seemed to be very generally supposed that the same cause the increased gold
--production had the effect, through its influence on trade, of calling into operation so

many tendencies of a contrary nature, that, on the whole, the depreciation must pro-

ceed with extreme slowness, the results being dispersed over a period so great as to

take from them any practical importance, and that at all events up to the present time

no sensible effect upon prices had thence arisen. The existence of this opinion amongst

economists was, he apprehended, to be attiibuted in some degree to the circumstance

that so few had taken the pains to compare the actual prices of the present time with

those of the period previous to the gold discoveries; but much more to the fact that

the character of the new agency and the mode of its operation were not in general

correctly conceived. The most general opinion with reference to the action of an

increased supply of money upon its value was, that a depreciation of money, so far as

it arises from this cause, is uniform, that is to say, takes place in the same degree in

relation  tojall  commodities                                                           and  that therefore                                                                                                                                  prices,  so                                      far  as they  are  influenced  by
                                                                                     ;

an increase of money, must exhibit a uniform advance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          and, no such uniformity being
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

observed in the actual movements of prices, the inference had not unnaturally been

--made, that the enhancement, so far as it has taken place, is not due to this cause

that it is not money which has fallen, but commodities which have risen in value.

With respect to this doctrine of the uniform action of an increased supply of money

upon its value in relation to commodities, he was quite prepared to admit its sound-

ness, provided sufficient time were allowed for the disturbances introduced by the new
additions to be corrected. He conceived, howevei-, that these disturbances, when the

augmentations took place upon the scale which we were at present witnessing, were

of a kind which did not admit of speedy correction, but might continue throughout

the whole period of progi-essive depreciation                                                                                                                                                                                                a period, which, if he might venture to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

express an opinion on the subject, would probably extend over some thirty or forty

years. The mode in which an increased production of gold operated in depreciating

its value, and thus raising general prices, appeared to him to be twofold, and to take

place, first, directly, through the medium of an enlarged money demand ; and secondly,

indirectly, through a contraction of supplj'. Prof. Cairnes then stated in detail the

--considerations from which he arrived at the following general conclusions : First,

that the commodities, the price of which may first be expected to rise under the influ-

ence of the new money, are those which fall most extensively within the consumption

of the productive classes, but more particularly within the consumption of the labour-

ing and artisan section of these. Secondly, that of such commodities, that portion

which consists of finished manufactures, though their price may in the first instance

be rapidly raised, cannot continue long in advance of the general level, owing to the

facilities available for rapidly extending the supply ; whereas, should the production,

from over-estimation of the increasing requirements, be once carried to excess, their

price, in consequence of the difficulty of contracting the supply, may be kept for some

considerable time below the general level. Thirdly, that sucli raw products as fall

within the consumption of the classes indicated, not being susceptible of the same

rapid extension as manufactures, may continue for some time in advance of the gene-

ral movement, and that among raw products the effects will be more marked in those

derived from the animal than in those derived from the vegetable kingdom. And,

fourthly, that the commodities last to feel the effects of the nev/ money, and which

may be expected to rise most slowly under its influence, are those articles of finished
                                                                                                                    ;

manufacture which do not happen to fall within the range of the new expenditure

such articles hcing aftected only by its indirect action, that is to say, through its action
upon wages, and this action being in their case obstructed by the impediments to the

contraction of supply. Up to this point, Prof Cairnes said, he found his conclusions
corroborated by the independent investigations of an eminent French economist, M,

Levasseur. There was, however, another principle wliich it appeared to him must
exercise a powerful influence on ihe course of the movement, namely, that efficacy
which resides in the currency of each country into which any portion of the new
money may be received for determining the effect of this infusion on the range of
local prices, using the words "local prices" with reference to commodities in the
locality in which they are produced, not to that in which they are sold. According to
this principle, the advance followed the locality in which the commodity was produced.
Thus the rise in price had been most rapid in commodities produced in the gold coun-

--tries, having in these at one bound reached its utmost limit that, namely, which is

set by the cost of producing gold. After the commodities produced in the gold re-
gions, the advance, he conceived, would proceed most rapidly in the productions of
England and the United States ; after these, at no great interval, in the productions
of the Continent of Europe ; while the commodities the last to feel the effects of the

new money, and which vtrould advance most slowly under its influence, were the pro-
ductions of India and China, and, he might add, of tropical countries generally, so far

as their economic conditions correspond with those of these coimtries. Prof. Cairnes
submitted to the Section some statistical tables which he had drawn up, with a view
to compare the conclusions at which he had arrived as to a depreciation of the pre-
cious metals under the action of an increased supply with the actual progress of prices

up to the present time. He remarked that, considering the propitiousness of the

seasons, the action of free trade, the absence of war, the contraction of credit, and the
general tendencies to a reduction of cost proceeding from the progress of knowledge,
were there no other cause in operation, we should have reason to look for a very con-
siderable fall of prices at the present time, as compared with, say eight or ten years
ago. Prices, however, had very decidedly risen, and the advance had, moreover,
proceeded in conformity with the principles which he had in his paper endeavoured to
establish. This was his ground for asserting that the depreciation of our standard
money was already, under the action of new gold, an accomplished fact.

On the Registry of Deeds in the West Riding. By J. E. Dibb.

The West-Riding Registry, he stated, was established on the 29th of September,

1704, the first object being to facilitate the borrowing of money by honest traders, who

found it difficult to give security to the satisfaction of the money-lenders, although

the securities they offered were really good. The second object was, to remedy the

evils which might be produced by secret conveyances of freehold property, by means

of which the ill-disposed had it in their power to commit fraud. That registry which

the law thus permitted had, for a long series of years, become the ordinary practice

and it wotild, perhaps, scarcely be possible at this time to find a freehold estate in the

West Riding which is not affected by a registered document. Passing by 1704 to 1710

as exceptional, it might be noted that while the yearly average of the registries from

1711 to 1720 was only 838, the average from 1791 to 1800 had risen to 2355; and

taking the average from 1841 to 1850, it rose to 5138, having more than doubled itself

in the first half of this century. This increase of transactions in landed property was

nearly in proportion to the increase in the population of the West Riding, which was,

inl8bl,572,JG8; 1811,662,875; 1821,809,363; 1831,984,609; 1841,1,163,580;

1851, 1,325,495. In 1851, however, the gradual increase of previous years was

changed for a much more rapid rise ; far greater in proportion than the increase of
the population. The previous year, 1850, had shown the largest nxunber of deeds

registered,  viz.  5950                           the  year  1851,  however,  reached  8009,  and,  in  1853,  the  largest
                                               ;

number of all was attained, viz. 9910. This large accession of transactions in real

estate at this period arose, Mr. Dibb stated, from the fact that in October 1850, the
176 REPORT--1858.

new Stamp Act came into operation, by which the duties payable on conveyances and

mortgages were very largely reduced. Beginning with the year ] 843, the operations
of building societies have gradually assumed some importance. The number of deeds
registered in connexion with these societies had risen from .31 in the year 1843, to
637 in 1857, the largest number being G82 in 1855. The total for the last fifteen years

was 4608. A system of registry which enabled a vendor or mortgagor to show readily

that he had a satisfactory title, and which secured the purchaser or mortgagee against
secret and fraudulent conveyances, must be a benefit, provided the cost of its attain-
ment be not too great. The distinctive feature of the West Riding Registry was, that
while anyone might search and inspect its records, there was, nevertheless, no expo-
sure of private affairs. In conclusion, Mr. Dibb suggested that a consideration of the

statistics of the West Riding Register would afford many very useful suggestions to-

wards the establishment of a general register, as well in those particulars which it
might be desirable to adopt, as in those which it might be prudent to avoid.

   Mr. Donnelly, Registrar-General of Ireland, gave an account of the manner in
which agricultural statistics are collected in that country. About 4000 enumerators,
selected from the constabulary force for their intelligence, were employed last year.
The names of all occupiers, nearly 600,000, are obtained, and, so far as could be ascer-
tained, not a single tenant farmer, however small his holding, refused to give the
required information. This success he attributed mainly to the assistance afforded by
the landed proprietors, magistracy, and clergy of all denominations, and by the press, in
removing prejudices against these inquiries ; but particularly to the gratuitous distri-
bution, annually, of about 10,000 copies of ' General Abstracts*,' which show, by
counties, the number of live stock, and the acreage under each crop, all reference to
the property of any individual being carefully avoided. Tables of the estimated pro-
duce of the various crops, and of the size of the holdings, in nine classes, by baronies,

and Poor Law Unions, are also subsequently published, so that these statistics are be-
coming more perfect each year, and are now very popular in Ireland.

           On Public Service, Academic, and Teachers' Examinations.

                          By James Heywood, F.R.S.

    English public service examinations are of two kinds ; comprising a special adap-
tation to the business of each respective office in the case of candidates nominated by
private influence; and a more general range of examination, so as to admit candidates
from public schools or the ancient universities, in the case of competitive examiuations,

without nomination.

   For the civil service of the Government at home, a nomination by private influence
is the first requisite ; candidates thus obtain a place on the list for examination in the
department to which they desire to belong ; the examinations vary according to the
requirements of the different offices of state, and are frequently special.

   Under the Committee of Council of Education, the preliminary examination for
clerkships includes, writing from dictation, arithmetic, bookkeeping, the precis and
digest of forms into summaries, making fair copies from rough notes, and the calcu-

lation of per-centages.

  A competitive examination follows, which comprises English composition, geography,

history, mathematics, and natural science.
   The organization of competitive examinations for the Royal Military Academy,

Woolwich, was carried into effect with the aid of the Right Hon. W. Monsell, M.P.,
Sir Benjamin Hawes, and the Rev. H. Moseley. Age in the candidates is limited to

between seventeen and twenty years; a certificate of good character is required from
each candidate, and an inspection by military surgeons is ordered, to prove the bodily

fitness of the candidates for the performance of military duties. No nomination is

requisite, but the examination is conducted on the basis of the general education of
the country, and is intended to admit the competition of candidates educated in the

public schools, so that candidates for the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers may

have secured the acknowledged advantages of the training of these schools, which are

connected quite as much with the large open play-grounds, and bold athletic games

                                    * These Abstracts cost One Penny each.

of the boys, as with the scholastic system, in which the number of masters does not

always sutfice for the complete superintendence of daily instruction.

   Of the thirty young men who were selected in June 1857, for the Woolwich Aca-
demy, ten had been educated in the University of Dublin, one was a member of

Merton College, Oxford, one came from Rugby School, two from Marlborough College,

one from King's College School, London, one from Ipswich School, one from Chelt-

enham College, one from Kensington Proprietary School, one from Clapham Grammar

School, and the remaining eleven had been educated privately.
    Candidates for the Indian civil service are required to be between the ages of eighteen

and twenty-three ; and a medical certificate of the absence of any physical infirmity,

with a satisfactory testimonial of good moral character, is the principal introduction
requisite to admit a candidate to the examination for entrance. The business of re-

gulating the examination has been entrusted to the Civil Service Commissioners, the

Right Hon. Sir Edward Ryan, and Sir John Shaw Lefevre, whose central office is at
Dean's Yard, near Westminster Abbey ; in the month of July, in the present year
1858, the candidates were examined in the large rooms of Burlington House, Piccadilly,
London. Sixty-five candidates were arranged in order of merit after this examination,

of whom the first twenty were appointed to the Indian civil service. An Irish news-

paper-writer, on looking over the list, noticed at once that the largest number of suc-
cessful candidates had come from classical Oxford, nine out of the twenty having been
Oxonians ; six successful candidates were members of the University of Dublin, and of
these, five were holders of classical scholarships in Trinity College. Altogether, of
the twenty who succeeded, there were sixteen classical men elected to the Indian

civil service.

   Two memorials have been recently presented to the Senate of the University of

London, from various eminent scientific gentlemen, requesting that degrees in science

Amay be conferred in that university,  committee of the Senate, consisting of the

chancellor (Earl Granville), the vice-chancellor (Sir John Shaw Lefevre), Dr. Arnott,

Mr. Brande, Sir James Clark, Dr. Faraday, Mr. Grote, and Mr. Walker, was conse-

quently appointed to consider the propriety of establishing a degree or degrees in

science, and the conditions on which such degree or degrees should be conferred.

Many of the memoralists have kindly contributed evidence on scientific degrees to

the committee, and the preliminary report of the committee recommends the consti-

tution of one or more degrees expressly attesting scientific proficiency and eminence.

  A considerable number of training colleges for the education of schoolmasters and

schoolmistresses have been established under the Committee of Council in connexion

with different religious denominations, and to these institutions, between the years

1837 and 1857 inclusive, the Committee of Council awarded grants amounting alto-

gether to ,£347,000.

   Many of the English Normal Schools are connected with the Church of England,

but the plan of instruction includes a variety of subjects equally valuable and inter-

esting to the members of all religious denominations.
   The training institution for teachers, in connexion with the British and Foreign

School Society in the Borough Road, Southwark, has outgrown the accommodation

afforded by the original design. Mr. Bowstead, in his report on this institution, dated
January 1858, observes, that "several candidates who successfully passed the recent

examination for Queen's scholarships have been imable to obtain admittance."

On tlie Importance of a Colonial Penny Postage, viewed in relation to the
 advancement of Science and Christian Civilization. By Mrs. Wm. Fison.

--Beneficial influence of the Penny Postage. If the history of the penny postage in

this country were investigated, it would be found to have been a most important pro-

moter of scientific progress, of education, commerce, religion, and the principles of

good government.

To the poorer classes its benefits have been incalculable in stimulating them to

acquire the power of writing.

   When the penny postage was first given to this country, many were the fears ex-

pressed as to the result, none of which have been realized ; and its extension to the

colonies is now advocated on grounds of high importance.

--178 REPORT 1858.

   In a religious and moral point of view, the benefits of a colonial penny postage would
be inconceivably great to our fellow-countrymen in the colonies. It must be remem-
bered that the tide of emigration is rolling on at a rate that exceeds every ecclesiastical
resource, and baffles every endeavour adequately to influence it by ordinary means of

evangelization.

   The important measure now advocated would prove one great means of remedy for

these evils. It would penetrate to the most remote districts of our colonies, entering
the scattered dwellings of emigrants, too far removed perliaps from civilized life for
any other outward medium of religious and intellectual progress.

    Another most important consideration in favour of a colonial penny postage, is the

influence it would exercise upon emigration.
   From the increase of education in Great Britain, emigration has assumed a new

feature within the last ten or twelve years, and a much larger proportion of the emi-

grants can read and write.
    Nothino- is more needed for the full development of this important means of colo-

nization than free interchange of thought between those who have emigrated and

friends at home.
   In this way would a penny postage be constantly pouring correct and unbiassed

information into the mother country, preventing many mistakes made by persons emi-
grating to the wrong place and at the wrong time, thus avoiding much misery and

suffering.

    Free correspondence would form a cord binding the colonies to the mother country
in ties scarcely possible to dissolve. The effect of distance wovdd be practically anni-
hilated, while the character of the colonists would continue to improve.

   In the prosecution of scientific research unrestricted communication between men
of science is an important condition of progress. Observers at meteorological, mag-

netic or astronomical stations, will often have occasion to communicate with others

similarly engaged, and it is much to be desired that all such intercourse should be

promoted by every possible means.
    Nor should the claims of commerce be forgotten in the enumeration of the con-

siderations which favour a colonial penny postage. Let it be remembered that the
benefits of free trade can by no means be considered as fully enjoyed while there is any

thing like a heavy charge of postage.
    It would be difficult duly to estimate the bearing a penny postage to Canada would

have upon our Anglo-Saxon brethren in America.
    Its action upon the United States would be immediate and powerful, and most pro-

bably would quickly induce them to arrange a similar rate of postage to England.

   Who can calculate the beneficial results to the human race of such an intercourse

 between the two great Protestant nations of the world, both sprung from one parent
 stock, and destined probably to be again united in carrying out the designs of an over-
 ruling Providence for the Christian civilization of the world ?

      On the Causes of the Fall in Price of Manufactured Cottons.
           By J. Pope Hennessy, M.P., of the Inner Temple.

The author commenced by observing that, apart from its practical importance to

men of business, the accurate determination of the causes which regulate the price of
cotton is a subject of much interest to the student of political economy. On that

accurate determination must to a great extent depend, in the present state of the

science, the value we attach to the arguments of the modern school of British econo-

mists with reference to one of their fundamental principles. Mr. Stuart Mill regards

the principle in question as the most important in political economy. He states it

thus : The law of production from the soil is a law of diminishing return in propor-

tion  to the  increased  application of labour and  capital                                whilst in  manufactures  the
                                                                                        ;
--very contrary is the case. Mr. Nassau Senior is still more explicit. He says : Ad-

ditional labour and capital when employed in manufactures are more, when em-

ployed in agriculture are less, efficient in proportion. At a former meeting of the

British Association, Mr. Hennessy pointed out that this principle was not sound in

--theory. He now proceeded to deal with the great practical illustration the price of
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                      179

--cotton with which it had been invariablj^ supported. He quoted the principal wri-

ters of the modern school ; and called particular attention to the following passage

from Mr. Senior's ' Elements of Political-Economy' :--" A century ago," says Mr.

Senior, " the average annual import of cotton wool into Great Britain was about
1,200,000 lbs. The amount now annually manufactured in Great Britain exceeds

240,000,000 lbs. But, though the materials now manufiictured are increased at least
200 times, it is obvious that the labour necessary to manufacture them has not in-
creased 200 times. The whole number of families in Groat Britain, exclusively of

those employed in agriculture, amounted, at the enumeration in 1831, to 2,453,041.

If we suppose the transport, manufacture and sale of cotton to employ about one-
eighth of them, or about 300,000 families, it is a large allowance. But with the in-

efficient machinery in use a century ago, the annual manufacture of 1,200,000 lbs. of

cotton could not have required the annual labour of less than 10,000 fiimilies. It

probably required many more. The result has been that, although we now require

200 times as much of the raw material as was required a century ago, and although
that additional quantity of raw material is probably obtained from the soil by more

than 200 times the labour that was necessary to obtain the smaller quantity, yet,

in consequence of the diminution of the labour necessary to manufacture a given

amount, the price of the manufactured commodity (a price which exhibits the sum

of the labour necessary both for obtaining the materials and working them up) has

constantly diminished. In 1786, when our annual import was about 20,000,000 lbs.

of cotton wool, the price of the yarn denominated 100 was 38s. a pound. In 1792,

when the import amoimted to 34,000,000 lbs., the price of the same yarn was l6s.

the pound. In 1806, when the import amounted to 60,000,000 lbs., the price of

the yarn had fallen to 7s. 2d. a pound ; and, with the increased quantity manufac-

tured, it has now (1845) fallen below 3s. a pound. Every increase in the quan-

tity manufactured has been accompanied by improvements in machinery and an

increased division of labour, and their effects have much more than balanced any

increase which may have taken place in the proportionate labour necessary to pro-

duce the raw material." Mr. Hennessy remarked that any one acquainted with

the history of the cotton manufacture of Great Britain would at once see a fallacy

which somewhat damages Mr. Senior's illustration. The yarn No. 100, though

it had the same denomination, was not of the same quality from 178G to 1845. "With

the increase in the production there was a diminution in the fineness of the yarn.

This appears to have been owing to popular caprice, and not to any defect inherent

in the process of manufacture. The people did not care to get the yarn so fine, and

accordingly it vpas not so expensively manufactured. But there is another fallacy in

this statement, which is far more important. During all the periods specified by

Mr. Senior there was a continuous fall, instead of a rise, in the price of raw cotton.

The extent of this may be judged from the fact, that from 1786, when 19,475,020 lbs.

were imported, to 1845, when the annualumport was 721,979,953 lbs., the fall in the

--price of the agricultural product was over 9-33 per cent. From 1806 to 1845 another
--of the periods selected by Mr. Senior the fall in the price of the raw material was

4*78 per cent. The precise nature and value of Mr. Senior's mistake will be seen by

taking a particular case, and going somewhat deeper into statistics than he has done.

In 1812, 63,026,936 lbs. of raw cotton were imported, and the price of the manufac-

tured yarn No, 100 was 5s. 2d. a-pound. In 1830, when the annual import was

--263,961,452 lbs., the price of the same sort of yarn was 3s. A\d. that is, there was

--a fall in price of Is. 9|</. According to Mr. Senior, this was owing to the extension

of the manufacture an extension which more than balanced, he says, the rise in price

Aconsequent on the increased production of the raw material.  table in Mr. Baines's

work, on the ' History of the Cotton Trade,' shows that this difference in price was

made up of two items. One of these was the result of the skill consequent, if Mr.

Senior must have it so, on the increased manufacture. But this, instead of being

more than Is. 9|(/., was only 7|</., and the other amounted to Is. 2\d. Now it ap-

pears that this other item, 70 per cent, of the reduced price of the manufactiu-ed

goods, was solely owing to the reduction in the price of the raw produce, though the

amount of that produce had increased 400 per cent.

         On some of the Results of the Society of Arts' Examinations.
      By John Pope Hennessy, M.P., of the Inner Temple, London.

    Statistics of an interesting and useful kind have at various times been published
with reference to the primarj' education of the working classes. Such statistical
tables, however, referred to the period of school life; to the number of years spent at
school and the age at which children left school. The results of the Society of Arts'
examination furnish a new class of educational facts. They deal with persons who
have left the school for the workshop. They enable us to estimate the relative
effects of different periods of school-life. They enable us to estimate the effect which
early removal from school has on that portion of the working population with which
the system deals. In one of the printed forms of inquiry which each candidate at
the final portion of the late examination was requested to fill up, the following ques-

tions were asked: " How many years were you at school?" " How many years have

elapsed since you left school ?" The total number of candidates examined this year
was 1107, but, as some were rejected at the preliminary examination, as others did
not offer themselves for the final examination, and as some of the forms, as far as the
mere educational statistics were concerned, were imperfectly filled, not more than 310
supplied the requisite information. I have to thank the Council of the Society of

Arts for having placed at my disposal all the documents referring to the examination.

Neither the Council, however, nor any of the officers of the Society are answerable
either for the statements of fact or the expressions of opinion which this paper con-
tains. The first result at which I arrived was that the average period of the school
life of the candidates was under that usually regarded by educationists as the normal
and necessary period. Some of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools have asserted
that the normal period of school life is 12 years. Other educationists have estimated

--this period at nine or ten years ; that being in fact the average duration of school life

on the Continent, in Bavaria, Holland, Switzerland, Sweden, and many other coun-

tries. It will be seen from the following table that the great majority of the candi-

dates were at school for a much shorter period.

pears that, in proportion to the number of candidates in each class, those whose ave-

rage period of scliool life was only 3 years 7 months, obtained more than twice as
many of the highest places as those whose average school time was 7 years 8 months.

Although this result is a fact, and, as such, is probably worth volumes of speculations

on the theoretical aspect of the question, yet I do not think it can justify any positive

conclusion of much value. Should it be confirmed by the experience of future years,

and by a still more widely-extended inquiry, it may become a question whether insti-

--Uitional education to which, as a matter of course, it is almost altogether owing-

ought not to be regarded as a system of popular instruction coming as fairly within
the scope of Parliamentary support as the elementary education in the schools under
inspection. Without, however, at present justifying a positive conclusion of any

great importance, it indicates the necessity of extreme caution in discussing the edu-

cation question. It would appear to show, for instance, that no fair analogy exists

between the school-period of a country like England, where Mechanics' Institutions
are established in every town, and countries like most of those on the Continent, where

such institutions are not to be found. It would appear to show that youthful labour

and early intercourse with the world may enlarge the mind and give additional force

to intellectual exertion                                                                                                    and it would even appear to throw a doubt over all schemes
                                                                                                                         ;

quantity of clay ironstone raised in the West Riding, as far as returns had been ob-
tained, was 207,500 tons. The cold-blast furnaces of the West Riding appeared to

have produced 63,000 tons of pig iron. The total produce of pig iron of the West

Riding was estimated at 117,000 tons; the North Riding, 179,838 tons; the total

produce of pig iron in Yorkshire being 296,838 tons, against 275,600 tons in 1856.

The production of coals from the different districts of the West Riding, in which there

are 374 collieries, had been 8,875,440 tons, showing a falling off of 208,185 tons as
compared with 1856, in which year the coal production of the West Riding amounted

to 9,083,625 tons. From returns received from 102 quarries in Yorkshire, producing
stone of various kinds, the value of the stone raised in 1857 was estimated at ,^105,374.

On the Worsted Manufactures of Yorkshire. By John James, F.8.A.

--The worsted manufacture was originally established in Yorkshire from two causes
   1st, The high rate of wages at Norwich, which led to the employment of the wea-

vers of the West Riding in producing the coarser kinds of worsted, such as shalloons,

towards the close of the  seventeenth  century                                      2nd, the  introduction of the  factory
                                                                                 ;

system at Bradford, about the year 1800, when it was neglected by the manufacturers

of Norwich, whereby, after a time, one by one of its staple fabrics was transferred to

the North. The author referred to the care with which the worsted manufacturers

had improved their machinery, so that where formerly 250 revolutions of the cylinder
a minute were considered a fair velocity in spinning frames, now 360 is about the num-
ber. Likewise the quantity of work from power-looms is very much greater than
some time ago, being now 160 to 180 picks a minute, whereas sixty and eighty were
not long since the ordinary speed. The consequence of this excellence and velocity

of machinery had resulted in the production of worsted pieces of good quality at ex-

Aceedingly low rates.     mighty revolution had been effected in the worsted industry

by the use of cotton warps. In this branch (the worsted) there have been four great

epochs; 1st, the original use of spinning machinery; 2nd, the application of the power-

loom to the weaving of stuffs about 1824 ; 3rd, the use of cotton warps in 1835 ; and

lastly, the combing of wool by machines. Mr. James referred at length to the changes

that had been effected in the trade by the use of cotton warps. He noticed the de-

fects in the designs of the worsted manufacturers, and their tendency to pirate those
of their neighbours ; and, after paying a high compliment to the worsted dyers, and
noticing the difficulties they had surmounted in dyeing goods woven of cotton and
wool, he alluded to the taste for alpaca and lustrous stuffs, and the great demand for

the bright lustre wools of Yorkshire, Notts, and Lincolnshire. He proceeded to re-
mark on the limited supply of wool and the competition of the Belgians and French

--in our wool markets, whereby the price and supply had been affected, but the quan-

tity exported, and the extra consiunption of our manufacturers would, he thought, be

more than compensated by the increased import from our Colonial possessions, whence
the supply was yearly increasing. Nor did he fear the rivalry of the Belgian and
French manufacturers in the markets of the world, for, although we might lose them

as customers, they were not heavy ones, and China and other channels would be
opened, so that the balance would still be in our favour. These nations were import-
ing vast quantities of spinning and weaving machinery from the best makers at Brad-

ford and Keighley ; but with all their efforts it would be long before they could com-
pete with us in producing an Orleans or Coburg cloth at English prices. Yet it
behoved us to be watchful lest from the high price of labour in England they tread
too closely on our footsteps. To show the immense importance of the Yorkshire

manufacture, he mentioned that there were 1,212,587 worsted spindles, consuming

of Yorkshire were 78,994, namely 26,750 males, and 52,244 females. Within the last

few years the worsted industry had attained tlio proud position of being the second of

                                                                                                   ;

shire it was predominant. There the cotton branch was insignificant, and that of

woollen only employs in its factories 42,982 persons. In the worsted trade of York-

shire there arc 35,298 power-looms, and in woollen only 6275. Mr. James objected

to any estimate which would raise the woollen manufacture above that of worsted in

value ; and claimed for Bradford the high honour of being the metropolis of the second

manufacture in the kingdom. He alluded to the present tendency to employ adult

labour in worsted factories. Formerly one-fourth of the factory hands were children

now the proportion is one-eighth. Notwithstanding the panic of last year, which

caused such disastrous effects in the worsted districts of the North, and paralysed its

trade, it had wonderfully recovered from the shock, and, like a sick man who in a

fever had thrown off his morbific humours, now appeared to be in a sound and healthy

state. He estimated the whole of the worsted manufactures of England to be of the

yearly value (inclusive of materials) of £18,000,000. Of this, the Yorkshire portion

is at least £13,000,000, made up thus:

Worsted pieces of all descriptions                              £10,000,000
--Yarns for export, and for the Glasgow, Manchester, Nor-

wich, and other markets                                         3,000,000

Mr. James spoke highly of the worsted operatives, whom he described as superior in

condition to those in any other manufacture, whether physically, morally, or intellec-

tually. The worsted factory girls were, he thought, much superior in cleanliness and

appearance, and orderly habits, to those in cotton factories ; he remarked on the
elegance and respectability of their attire on Sundays, and concluded by expressing
an opinion that the worsted manufacture was destined to furnish a large portion of
female dress for the whole of the civilized globe, suitable alike for all climes, whether
cold or hot, and for all classes, whether grave or gay.

                             On the Iron Trade of Leeds.

       Sy James Kitson,jmw., of Monk Bridge Iron Works, Leeds.

   The iron trade of Leeds is at once the most ancient and most modern of the

branches of industry carried on in the borough ; the most ancient, because it can be
proved, by the remains of the scoria of ancient iron works, that this metal was manu-
factured here hundreds of years ago ; the most modern, as it has attained its present

extent within the last thirty years, before which time it existed on a very limited

scale.

   Extensive beds of scoriae and other remains have been found at Horsforth, within

the borough, and near to the old Roman town at Adel. Four branches of the iron trade

--flourish in Leeds; the manufacture of 1. Iron; 2. Cut Nails; 3. Textile machinery

and machine tools ; 4. Locomotive engines and railway plant generally.
    1. There are six smelting furnaces manufacturing iron on the cold-blast system, for

the production of the highest qualities of Yorkshire iron. Four were in blast last
year, which made 12,745 tons of pig iron. The hands employed in this branch are
2120. The average amount of weekly wages £2540. Total wages paid during 1857,
£132,080. Total consumption of coals, 198,122 tons. Total production of malleable

iron, 41,734 tons. Average price of pig iron sold, £5 lo-. ; total annual value, £30,426.
Average price of malleable iron, £15 4s.; total annual value, £634,356. Capital

vested in plant, buildings, &c. £348,500,

    The average price of the malleable iron is double that of ordinary Staffordshire
iron, which is a sure indication of the esteem in which it is held ; it is used principally

for the highest engineering purposes.

    2. Cut nails are manufactured extensively. The number of hands employed in
this branch is 188. Total wages paid in 1857, £6188. Total production of nails,
3452 tons. Average price, £14 13s. Total annual value, £50,575. For those curious
in numbers, it has been calculated that about seventy millions of nails are cut in Leeds

 every week.

    3. FentoD, Murray and Co. were the founders of the machine trade in Leeds;
--184 REPORT 1858.

they commenced in 1798, and constructed engines and flax machinery for the mills

in the neighbourhood. Machine tools for engineers and others are also extensively

manufactured here. The number of hands employed in the trade is 4578. Average

amount of weekly wages, £3961. Total amount paid in 1857, £205,972. Total con-

sumption of pig iron in foundries, 13,924 tons. Total value of products, £545,217.

Capital invested in plant and buildings, £346,475,

4. Stationary and locomotive engines, wheels and axles, railway bridges, &c., have

been largely manufactured here of late. The number of hands employed in this trade

is 4023. Average amount of weekly wages, £4151. Total amount paid in 1857,

£215,852. Total consumption of pig iron in foundries, 12,862 tons. Total value of

products, £672,600. Capital invested in plant, buildings, &c., £283,500. In addi-

tion to these, we have about 3000 miners engaged in raising iron-stone and coal for

--iron manufacturing at an average of £1 per head per week.
   The totals of all the four branches are hands employed, 10,909. Weekly wages,

£10,771. Paid in 1857, £560,092. Value of products, £1,933,174. Capital invested
in plant, &c. £990,975. The total consumption of pig iron in the^forges and foun-

dries of the district is about 75,000 tons annually, or nearly one-third of the annual

production of Great Britain only fifty years ago. The greater portion of the goods

manufactured is exported to foreign countries. Leeds iron is sent to all quarters and

countries of the globe ; with Leeds nails the emigrant fastens together his first rude

habitation ; Leeds machinery is spinning and Leeds tools are working in every seat
of industry on the Continent ; and Leeds locomotives are drawing their burdens, in-

different whether it be on the fertile plains of India, or on the sides of the snowy

Andes. The central position of Leeds, abundance of labour, cheapness of fuel, facility

of access to the sources of the raw material, and easy transit to the ports on the east

or west coast, are the principal causes of the flourishing state of the iron trade in this

Atown.  branch of commerce which has extended so rapidly, and fixed so large a

capital in the town, must contain within itself sound and permanent elements, and

the fact that nearly one million sterling is actually invested so as to be practically

immoveable is a guarantee that it will be followed with continued energy.

On Free Trade in Belgium. By M. Corranader M^ren, of Brussels,

              Chairman of the International Free Trade Association.

In Belgium, the Government was looking forward anxiously to the reform of the

tariff, and a new law had been proposed to reduce the duties on cotton 12 or 15 per
cent. This measure, however, would meet with much opposition ; the seven mem-

bers for Ghent would vote against any change in the present duties on manufactured

cottons. The Belgian tariff had in several instances been modified in a liberal point

of view. The French Government, according to M. C. Maeren, seems anxious to give

a liberal turn to the tarifl'; but, notwithstanding their strength, the present rulers of

France were obliged to withdraw their liberal intentions, in presence of the powerful

industrial coalition of the northern departments and the deplorable ignorance of the

principles of political economy throughout the whole population. The writer then

stated that the Belgian Free Trade movement was progressing satisfactorily ; that all

the attention of its advocates was directed to the enlightening of the public mind on

the question                                                that great  results had been obtained  already ;  and  that, owing to the
                                                         ;

freedom they enjoyed, they confidently hoped for full success.

Sketch of the History of Flax Spinning in England, especially as developed

            in the Town of Leeds. By J. G. Marshall, F.G.S.

    There is, perhaps, no branch of our principal manufactures, except that of cotton,
in which the introduction of machinery and the factory system has produced more re-
markable changes than in that of flax spinning; and, as the town of Leeds is the place
where this new branch of industry first took root in England, and was successfully
carried out upon a considerable scale, and the place which has hitherto taken the lead

in the successive improvements introduced into the trade, it may be interesting to the

Section to have a short sketch of the origin and progress of flax spinning brought
before them whilst they are here.
                       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                            185

   The first essay in flax spinning in Leeds was made at a small mill driven by water,

called Scotland Mill, about four miles from Leeds, by my late father, John Marshall,

in partnership with Samuel Fenton of Leeds, and Ralph Dearlove of Knaresborough.

This was in 1788 and 1789.                                                                                                                                                   ,

The   wonderful    success and large  profits attending the introduction of                                                                                                     Arkwrigbt s

invention into cotton spinning had about this time attracted general attention to me-

chanical improvements applied to manufacturing purposes. The spinning of flax by

machinery was a thing nutch wished for by linen manufacturers. It attracted the

attention, amongst others, of Mr. Marshall, who was so strongly impressed with the
advantageous field for invention and enterprise oft'ered by flax spinning, that he de-

voted himself entirely to the new enterprise.
   It appears that some attempts at flax spinning had already been made on a small

scale at Darlington, and some other places, as the first spinning machines used at

Scotland Mill were on a patent plan of Kendrew and Co. of Darlington. This did
not answer ; experiments were made, and a patent taken out for a plan of Matthew

Murray's, then foreman of mechanics with Mr. Marshall.

   In 1791 a mill was built in Holbeck, Leeds, and at first driven by one of Savery's
steam engines, in combination with a water-wheel, but in 1792 one of Boultou and

Watt's steam engines of tvventy-eight horse power was put down. In 1793 there were

We900 spinning spindles at work.             may take this small item as our first statistical

datum of flax spinning in Leeds.
   I may here describe an important difference between the state in which the raw

material flax is presented to the spinner and that in which cotton, wool, or silk is
found previous to being manufactured. The fibres of cotton, wool, and silk are sup-
plied by nature already in their finest slate of subdivision ; they require merely to be
straightened and formed into a continuous thread. In raw flax, on the other hand,

the ultimate fibres, which are very fine, are united by a gummy matter into broad strips

or ribands, and a very operose process, called heckling, is required to subdivide the

material into finer fibres before the spinning process can begin.
   In the earlier stages of flax spinning this preparatory process was performed entirely

by adult men, called hecklers.

As soon as the flax spinning by machinery began to increase considerably, the de-

mand for the labour of the hecklers enabled them to obtain high wages (as much as

two guineas a week, if they worked), and, as they were combined in Trades Unions,

and enforced the old limitations on the number of apprentices, they became possessed

of a species of monopoly, extremely troublesome and prejudicial to the progress of

the trade. In fact no large extension or well-organized system was practicable so

Along as this barrier remained on the threshold.      patent for a heckling machine by

which this process could he performed without the assistance of adult labour was taken

out in the name of Matthew Murray, about 1805. Its introduction was resisted at

first by the men with much violence and intimidation, but, being firmly persevered in,

it became an established portion of the system. It was introduced gradually into

general use in the trade, and had the eflTect of neutralizing the monopoly of the hand

hecklers, without any sudden displacement of labour.
   The next step was the establishment, by Mr. Murray, of a good machine-making

shop for flax machines, which became the parent or precursor of many others, until

Leeds became the seat of a very important branch of business in machine-making,

chiefly for flax spinning.

The system of flax spinning had now become firmly established and well-organized,

and made steady progress ; but as yet was only applicable to the production of the
coarser description of yarns, up to No. 16, or 16 lea yarn, which was manufactured at
Barnsley into the coarser description of linens. The material employed was almost

entirely Baltic flax.

An improvement was next introduced into the processes, called preparing, prece-

ding  the  actual  twisting  of the  fibres  into  a  thread in  the  spinning  machine                                                                                         this  im-
                                                                                                                               ;

provement consisted in drawing the fibres through fine heckles or gills instead of roll-

ers, thus giving the means of producing a much evener and finer thread, that is

up to 40 or 50 leas, and for these yarns the finer flax of Flanders and Holland began

to be used. This was about the year 1820, when the finer description of yarn came

--into very extensive use in the manufacture of the finer and better sorts of drills, an

important branch of the Barusley linen trade.
--186 REPORT 1858.

   We now come to the introduction of a very important improvement in the spin-

ning process as applied to flax. I have adverted to the gummy matter wliich in raw

flax unites or glues together the fine ultimate fibres into much coarser ones, and which
it is the object of the heckling process to subdivide by mechanical means. The divi-
 sion so effected can only be imperfect ; and it was found that the fibres could be more

 completely separated by saturating the material with water, which dissolves or softens

the gummy matter in the spinning machine itself, when in the actual process of being

drawn out and spun.
    There is a somewhat singular history attached to the origin and progress of this

invention of wet spinning. During the great war between England and the first

Napoleon, it became a leading object of his policy to exclude English manufactures,

and to encourage those of France. England had taken a decided lead in the cotton

manufacture, but at that time, about the beginning of the present century, little had
been done in England in applying machines to the linen trade. The linen trade of
France has always been a very important branch of industry, linen being more ex-

tensively used by the bulk of the population in France than in England. Napoleon
therefore wished, by encouraging the application of machinery to the linen trade in

France, to make it a rival to the cotton trade of England. He offered a reward of

a million francs for the successful application of machinery to the spinning of flax.

This inducement brought forward Girard, who produced designs for a series of

machines for preparing and spinning flax of great ingenuity and originality, inclu-

ding this plan of wet spinning. But what was the result so far as the linen trade of

France was concerned ? Girard could find no one in France with the enterprise and

--capital requisite to perfect and apply his invention. He had to come to England, he

had to come to the town of Leeds. A patent was taken out for his inventions in

England, especially for the wet spinning, under the name of Hall, in 1816, and was
taken up by Robert Busk of Leeds. Mr. Busk put up a considerable quantity of
machinery on this plan, and produced by it yarn much finer than that usually spun.
But he kept the new plan to himself; it was not tried by others; the improvements
in the preparatory processes were not then sufficiently advanced to make fine spinning
advantageous ; the plan did not answer commercially, and was given up and forgotten.
In 1826, however, it was revived in the shape of a new patent, with some modifica-
tions by Mr. Kay of Manchester. The validity of the claim to a new patent was
disputed by the body of flax spinners, and finally set aside. The first spinning ma-
chine on this plan was put up at the works of Messrs. Hives and Atkinson of Leeds,
and by them and by Messrs. Marshall chiefly the whole plan of wet spinning, with
the requisite improvements in the preparing processes, was soon perfected and carried

out.

A very wide  horizon  for  the   extension  of flax  spinning was  now  opened                              yams
                                                                                                         ;

could now be spun much finer than before (from 50 up to 200 leas), and also cheaper,

so as effectually to exclude hand-spun yarns from the whole range of linen manufac-

tures except those of the finest cambrics and lace. For a time large quantities of these

·wet-spun yarns were sent from Leeds and Lancashire to the north of Ireland, and to

France.

   But the new mode of spinning soon spread into Scotland, Ireland, and finally into
France, where it is now carried on (under the stimulus of a protective tariff", however)

to a large extent.

   Thus the object of the first Napoleon was at length accomplished, but not in the
way that he intended; the result was a benefit to France, but only as the consequence
of a still greater benefit to England. The present Emperor not long since rewarded
the descendants of Girard for his invention, the fruits of which were so long post-

poned.

   The later improvements which have followed the wet spinning have consisted in
the application of the combing machinery, which has done so much for the worsted

manufacturer, to flax-tow, so that a material capable of being spun to the finest yam

can be obtained from what is otherwise only of small value ; and various processes
have been tried for cleansing and softening the raw flax previous to its being spun.

   The manufacture of sewing thread from flax commenced not long after the intro-
duction of flax spinning by machinery, and has since increased and been a branch of
the linen trade of considerable importance, a large proportion of the thread manufac-

ture being carried on at Leeds.

   The application of the power-loom to the weaving of linens has of late years been
considerably on the increase, but to a much less extent than in the cotton and wor-
sted manufactures, as the greater part of the linens made in the United Kingdom

are still woven by hand labour.
    I have thought it necessary to give this account of the nature of the successive im-

provements introduced into flax spinning, in order to make the statistical figures I

shall now quote more intelligible.
   The sources from whence the statistics of the linen and flax spinning trades may

be derived are somewhat scanty, but, perhaps, enough may be stated to indicate the

progress of the manufacture.

    Previous to 1820 the import of flax had increased but slowly, but from that time
we see that the increase has been rapid, having more than trebled between that date

--and 1S5G or from 27,875 to 84,352. We must add to this the home growth, which

is, for Ireland about 22,000 tons yearly, on the average of the last ten years; for Eng-
land and Scotland a small quantity, probably not exceeding GOO or 700 tons.

   On the whole the annual consumption of flax in the United Kingdom will be about

100,000 tons, which, at an average price of £50, will make the yearly value of the raw

material of the linen manufactures about £5,000,000.

   From a Parliamentary Return we obtain the following particulars respecting the

flax spinning of the United Kingdom.

cumstances to account for the rapid increase in flax spinning in Ireland. The North

of Ireland is an old-established seat of the linen manufacture, chiefly of the lighter
fabrics suited for the export markets, and especially for those of the United States of

America, which since 1846 have so largely increased. Again, when the spinning by

--machinery was introduced into the North of Ireland, all the other branches of the ma-

nufacture were already established there the weaving, the bleaching, the commercial

establishments ; and besides this, the flax, the raw material, was grown at their own
doors. In England the linens manufactured have been more of the heavier and
higher priced description, and suited more for the home market than for export. In
Scotland the manufacture has consisted chiefly of the coarser and cheaper description
of linens and of yarns, and the export of the latter has been materially affected by

the high protective tariff's of the Continent, especially of France.

   Much attention has of late been attracted to the object of encouraging and increa-
sing the home growth of flax in England and Scotland ; but the introduction of this
species of agricultural produce into districts where it is entirely new is attended with
many difficulties, and but little has yet been effected in that direction. Many attempts
have also been made to introduce new fibrous materials from our Colonies and foreign
countries for use in the linen manufacture; and the new material, jute, imported from

India, and used chiefly in Scotland, has been of valuable service to the manufacturer

of that country. I may now draw attention to the following Table, showing the ex-
ports of the linen manufacture of the United Kingdom :

   These figures are certainly very remarkable, and aflibrd a succinct view of the
relation in which the different results stand to each other.

    In the War-office Report itself a comparison is instituted between the actual
mortality of the army and that which prevails in twenty-four large towns of England
and Wales ; but such a comparison is obviously at fault, for, as I have elsewhere
fully shown, the gross mortality, not only of the whole kingdom, but of individual
towns and districts, is greatly increased by the inclusion of the destitute, the disso-

lute, and the intemperate, as well as by the presence of many persons following

occupations and trades of an unusually unhealthy character. Even in the rural
districts of this country it will be seen, on referring to pp. 53-59 of ' Contributions

to Vital Statistics,' that the mortality of the sixteen trades referred to in page 58 of
that work is greatly in excess of the residue of the same districts.

   The military are certainly free from the noxious influences peculiar to many trades
and occupations. They do not suffer from destitution, nor can they be classed as a

body with the notoriously intemperate. Every just comparison must, therefore, be

made with some such classes as those forming the two last sections of the preceding
abstract ; but if the comparison be made with the general mortality of England and

Wales (for the male sex), it will be found that the infantry of the line are subject

to an increased ratio of mortality of no less than 91-752 per cent.

If the out-door occupations be made the standard of comparison,            per cent.
   there is an excess amounting to                                          133-620

And in respect to labourers in the rural districts, the excess is no less  194-658

    than

being nearly three times the rate of mortality in this branch of the service that is

found to take place amongst labourers in the rural districts at the corresponding ages.

   In Appendix LXXI. of the Report of the Commissioners, as well as in the body
of the Report itself, it is shown that among various classes exposed to severe night
duty in the open air, such as the Metropolitan Police Force, and the railway em-
ployes, and also as otherwise since established in the London Fire Brigade, the rate

of mortality is somewhat less than that for the country generally at the correspond-
ing ages. In the same Appendix it is also conclusively shown, as admitted in the
Report of the Commissioners, that the high rate of mortality in the army cannot be

accounted for by the prevalence of intemperance. It further appears in the same

Appendix, that whatever may be the primary cause of the greatly augmented mor-

tahty in the army, tlie immediate cause of it is the prevalence of consumption to an
extent entirely unprecedented, and quite unknown in connexion with any other series
of observations in the whole range of vital statistics ; and without a corresponding
increase from other causes, taking all branches of the army, the deaths from disease
of the respiratory organs form about 60 per cent, of the deaths from all causes. The
following abstract, however, places the results in a very distinct light :

 --4th. For districts in which the density varies from '84 '99.

   5th. For Lancashire ('28 or j^^th acres) ; and
   6th. For the residue of the population of England and Wales.
    If it be true that increasing density of population, particularly in the sense in
which it is understood in regard to barracks' sleeping accommodation, has a tendency
to augment diseases of the lungs more than all other diseases, then it is evident that
districts in which the sleeping accommodation differs so widely must show a marked

difference in the ratio of deaths taking place from phthisical causes. No doubt the

results of the influence of a uniformly and generally increased density of population
in a district which is not, in any considerable portion of it, highly intensified in its
overcrowding, would be unfairly compared with the results of a district or section of
population which is throughout overcrowded ; but in London or Lancashire, and in

the third district of England now under consideration, we have been long accustomed
to hear reports through the " Health of Towns Commission," of great, and, in many
instanees, of major portions of them being overcrowded to a degree which shocks
morality and the ordinary notions of common decency.

   Into these details it is now unnecessary to enter ; they are patent to all giving

attention to questions affecting the public health. Although, therefore, there is no
one district of the kingdom in which there is a uniform system of overcrowding,

-- --still there are many and among them those now under review in which the over-

crowding of the large portions of them is such, that if the hypothesis be of any value,
there must be at the least a slightly augmented ratio of death from consumption

compared with the general ratio of increase from all causes. Let us see how far this

is in agreement with recorded facts.
   It must be clearly understood that the hypothesis on which the Commissioners

--rest their conclusions is not simply that overcrowding may induce phthisis in an in-

creased ratio that would probably be denied by no one.

    In the army, the deaths from diseases of the lungs are absolutely, as well as rela-
tively, to the deaths from all other causes, in a ratio so high, beyond all precedent

and example, as to form a new and important problem for solution in vital statistics.

   The hypothesis, therefore, of the Commissioners resolves itself into the following :
" That ' overcrowding,' although it increases the general mortality, has the peculiar
characteristic of intensifying the deaths from diseases of the lungs greatly beyond

those from all other causes."
    It will be found that the total excess of deaths above the average for England and

Wales is 1981-57, while at the same ages, in diseases of the "respiratory organs"
only, it will be seen, on referring to Abstract B. preceding, that there is an excess of
no less than 1397*45 deaths, or at about 70 per cent, of the whole increase.

   This result deserves the most careful and patient consideration. According to the

mortality of England and Wales, the normal ratio of deaths from diseases of the

"respiratory organs" is 44'48 per cent.; and yet of the whole excess of deaths

from all causes, no less than 70 per cent., as appears by Abstract B., is due to the

organs of respiration.

    The full importance of this result will be perhaps better appreciated by the fol-

lowing illustration :

Difference of excess                              =;1397'4=109 per cent.

If the residue of the deaths from all other causes whatever be viewed in this man-

ner, the results are

Difference or excess                              = 595*2= 49 per cent.

   These results conclusively show that the condition of the army is such as to in»
duce an excess of diseases of the organs of respiration, with a much higher intensity
--192 REPORT 1858.

than all other diseases collectively ; in fact, the excess of deaths from diseases of the
organs of respiration, is considerably more than double that from all other causes.

   This peculiar feature in the mortality of the array has not been observed in any
other series of observations, and it is of the utmost importance to determine whether
the solution of it offered by the Commissioners be the correct one.

    Should their hypothesis be found not in accordance with facts and experience,
then the most serious consequences must result from it to the sanitary state of the
army ; as, without the true solution, there is little chance of effectual remedies being

applied.
    In Tables I. to VI. inclusive, appended, are given the ratio of mortality per cent,

from all specified causes at the different terms of life ; but I shall now refer simply

to the results for the soldiers' ages as given in the following abstract of the tables.

These results are very singular, and will appear still more so if it be kept in view

throwing out of comparison the Household Cavalry, a very small body, and there-

fore subject to marked fluctuations-- that as the general mortality increases so does

the ratio of deaths from diseases of the lungs increase. If, therefore, overcrowding

were the main cause of developing so inordinate an amount of consumption, the

barrack accommodation for the different branches of the service should be found con-

tracting in the order in which the general mortality, as well as that from consump-

tion, increases

                 A;
but it happens to be quite otherwise.          careful examination of the

preceding facts, it is believed, does anything but support the hypothesis of the Com-
missioners now under consideration.

   There is, however, another and in some respects a more simple, and in unskilful
hands a safer, way of solving this question, and that is, instead of taking the ratio
of the mortality from "one cause" to the mortality from " all causes," to deter-
mine the actual rate of mortality from " each cause," and I have accordingly placed

all the preceding results in that form. The detailed Tables hereto appended give the

results for various terms of life ; but in the abstract to which I ask the attention of

the Section, reference will be made to the results for the soldiers' ages only. In the

preparation of the following abstract, the actual mortality per cent, at the given

ages was in the first place determined, and then the differences per cent, between
these results and the corresponding ones for England and Wales were found ; and
the abstract will therefore show, for each cause of death in the army, whether it is

in greater or less activity than in the country generally.

from phthisis, and that for England and Wales, are less than the differences between

--the mortality from all causes, showing that death from phthisis is more positive in its

determination in other words, less subject to fluctuation, and less affected by
external causes, than the other diseases in the aggregate.

    In London, the densest of the districts, the increase beyond that of the country
generally from death by phthisis is 14 per cent., while the increase from all causes
is about 20 per cent. ; but in the least dense portion of the kingdom, as shown in
the last column of Abstract D, the decrease from phthisis is precisely 14*8 per cent.,
but that from all causes 27*8 per cent., reversing exactly the positions held by these
diseases in the army, as already pointed out, in which it was shown that the deaths
from diseases of the lungs were in excess of the normal number 109 per cent. ; but
the deaths from other causes were in excess only 49 per cent. There appears, there-
fore, no relation between the hypothesis advanced by the Royal Commission and
the causes of the actual increase of mortality which has taken place. If the great
havoc made in the ranks of the British army while at home had been occasioned
through deaths from zymotic causes, then the hypothesis under discussion would, if
applied to that class of diseases, have held good, and the conclusion they have arrived

at might have been suggestive of ulterior proceedings, beneficial to the brave men
who have to fight our battles, improving to their moral conditions and physical power,

thereby enhancing the financial resources of the empire.

   DThe results in the third line of Abstract are exactly confirmatory of those in

Abstract C, showing that density of population is only powerful in developing
zymotic diseases. It is somewhat remarkable that the results of the two abstracts,
in which the mode of expressing the relation of the facts recorded is so decidedly
different, should agree precisely, showing, in both instances, that the only diseases
which follow the order of density in their development is the zymotic class.

   DIf in Abstract the results for the deaths from the whole class of diseases of the

" respiratory organs " be taken into consideration instead of those from phthisis pul-
monalis, only the same reasoning and argument will be found to apply, the deaths
from consumption being always more constant, less affected by external circum-
stances, and showing less disturbance in their development in the different districts
than the remaining diseases. In fact, compare in any considerable portion of the
population, which is either more or less crowded than the average of the kingdom,
the deaths from phthisis and diseases of the respiratory organs, and the ratio will be

found always subject to less perturbation than the residue of all other diseases.
    If the hypothesis of the Commissioners were therefore well-founded, this would

not be so, for districts in which there was a large amount of overcrowding would,
when compared with those thinly populated, show, to a lesser or greater extent, the
well-marked peculiarity of the mortality in the army of intensifying deaths from
consumption more than those from other causes. The present investigation, how-
ever, shows that overcrowding produces the very opposite effect, and that deaths
from consumption are increased in a much less ratio than the deaths from other

 causes.

    If the methods followed in this communication, and the various conclusions thence

deduced, be thoroughly reliable, then it is obvious that many of the recommendations
made by the Royal Commission on the sanitary state of the army, however valuable
they may be on other grounds, will not, if carried out, produce the intended effect of
reducing the ratio of deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs among our sol-

diers to the normal conditions of the country generally.
    It was proposed to discuss in this paper the statistical value of the Commissioners'

hypothesis only, and not to enter on the consideration of the real cause of the high
ratio of deaths from consumption in the army. Enough, it is believed, has been

already adduced in Appendix LXXI. of the Report to indicate the chief cause of not

only the general high rate of mortality, but also of the very unprecedented and fright-
ful destruction of life by diseases of the lungs.

               On the Race and Language of the Gipsies.
                 By the Rev. T. W. Norwood, F.G.S.

   The Gipsies are said to have been first seen in Europe about the year 1417 ; before

which time their history is involved in very great obscurity.

  A wide-spread and persistent tradition amongst themselves declares them to be

Egyptians; which they certainly are not, however that denomination arose, and

whatever credit may seem due to its very general circulation. Many attempts have

been made to account for this tradition, but without any success.
   They arrived in England some time in the end of the fifteenth century. Polydore

Virgil seems to be the first author that mentions the English Gipsies : he speaks of
them as "Assyrians" or "Egyptians," in terms of strong reprobation. Wherever

they went, they early made themselves detestable by their vices and cunning ; and
consequently they have been persecuted throughout Europe in a way which makes
us wonder that they were not all exterminated. It remained long unknown whence
the Gipsies came, and to what race of men they ought to be referred ; but it was at

length discovered that they are an emigration from India, by researches into their

strange unwritten language. This disclosure is due to the scholars of Germany
and particularly to Grellman, who wrote his " Dissertation " in the last century.

The same conclusion might have been suggested from considerations of figure, feature,

and colour ; but the best criterion, upon the whole, that we have at present in such

questions, is the internal testimony of language. Language is the best test of race,

hitherto.

   Grellman arrived at the decision, by a limited comparison of " Gipsy " with
" Hindustani," that at least twelve Gipsy words out of every thirty were Indian.

We know now, after a wider examination, that this proportion has been almost

doubled ; and also that the Indian words in Gipsy are nearly all of " Sanskrit " origin.

"Gipsy" is now, in fact, proved to be a dialect of " Sanskrit," very much overlaid

with foreign words, such as a wandering nation would be sure to adopt ; and also
considerably differing, in original character, from any other known dialect of the

Sanskrit speech.

  We do not despair of finding, in the East, an idiom more closely allied to Gipsy

than any with which we are yet acquainted. At what time, or from what motives,

the Gipsies left India, no one has been able to determine.

The author of this paper read to the Section a list of sixty words (out of a large

vocabulary collected orally from the Gipsies by himself), each of which is a genuine

Sanskrit word, and common at the present day to the Gipsy and Hindustani dialects

of that language. These were names of numerals, elementary ideas, and familiar

natural objects, such as he judged likely to have been brought from the original

settlement of the race.

Doubtful words in "Gipsy," not yet traced to any language, are their names for

Acoin-i, articles of clothing, and things connected with religious worship.  list of these

was aho read. They may have been changed in travel. It was shown that Gipsy

has much more in common with Greek and Latin (especially with Greek) than with

any other European languages. In some of its suffixes it closely resembles the very
ancient Islandic and Lithuanian dialects. It has great facility, like Greek and Ger-

man, for coining new words by compounding old roots. This is a sign and property

of very ancient languages. Many specimens of Gipsy conversation, orally collected,

were read, with their exact pronunciation, to the Section. " Gipsy" and Gipsyisra

are fast declining and dying out in England ; meanwhile we remember the words of

--Dr. Johnson speaking on the whole subject of language : " I am not very wilhng

that any language should be totally extinguished. The similitude and derivation of

languages atford the most indubitable proof of the traduction of nations, and the

genealogy of mankind. They add often physical certainty to historical evidence of
ancient migrations, and of the revolutions of ages which left no written monuments

behind them."

than from sheep's wool ; and in tlie Institutes of Menu, written before the Christian
era, we learn that the sacrificial thread of a Brahmin must be made of cotton ; that
of a Cshatriya, of Sana thread only ; that of a Vaisya, of woollen thread. It is sup-
posed, that the Sana thread was most probably that of the Sunn {Crotalaria juncea).
Buddha, in his sermons preached 600 years before Christ, interdicted to women the

   The Ambaree {Hibiscus cannabinus), or Mesta plant of Bengal and Palungo of

Madras and Ambaree of Western India, is very generally cultivated all over India;
it grows from three to seven feet in height, the stem straight and simple ; it is usually
called Indian Hemp, or one of the Brown Hemps of Bombay.

   Bandikai of Madras, and Bendy of Bombay {Hibiscus longifoUus), grows to a great
height and very straight, with a few branches, and with pyramidal pods, which, when

young, are filled with a large proportion of mucilage, and are gathered and cooked as
a vegetable ; the fruit is also used to thicken soups, and the seeds added like barley

to it ; they may be also roasted as a substitute for coffee.
   The Deckanee Hemp, Ambaree, grows with a straight clear stem from four to seven

feet in height ; its leaves are in general used as an esculent vegetable by the natives,

and taste something like sorrel.
    Rouselle {Hibiscus Sabdariffa) is cultivated in most gardens, because its calices as

they ripen become fleshy, and are of a pleasant acid taste, and are employed for making

tarts, as well as an excellent jelly.

 --Marool of Madras, or Bowstring Hemp {Sanseoiera). ^The leaves when cultivated

are from three to four feet long; the fibre extends their whole length; from these

fibres the ancient Hindoos made a very tough elastic thread, of which they made their

bowstrings.

   The Naroo and the Naroo T fibres being both new ones, no description is yet given,

except that they are natives of Malabar.

   The Bunochra {Urena lobata), and the Kungio {Urena sinuata), are from two
weeds common in most parts of India.

   The Mudar, or Mudder, is met with in both the southern as well as the northern
parts of India, in considerable quantities in all uncultivated lands, and encroaches

even on cultivated grounds. It is a plant with broad, flcsliy, glaucous-coloured leaves,

and which, when pierced, gives out a milky juice from every part ; Akthis is called

and Mudar in northern, and Yercum in southern India. It is the Asclepias gigantea
of botanists. Its juice and the powdered bark of its roots are employed medicinally

by the natives of India in cases of leprosy and other cutaneous affections ; lately its
milky juice has been collected by making incisions into the plant, and preparing it as
a substitute for caoutchouc and gutta percha.

   The pods of the Mudar are full of a beautiful glossy silk down, which the natives
spin into a beautiful soft thread ; from intimation given, this article will soon come
into great use in the trade of this town (Leeds). The native mode of separating the
fibres of the Mudar is tedious, rude, and injurious ; notwithstanding it is one of the
strongest fibres known, as, from experiments made by Dr. Wight, it bore 552 lbs.,
when Crotalaria juncea bore only 404 lbs., and a small cord bore 3 cwt., without
showing the least symptom of distress yet by the samples now produced it certainly

housewives and servants if ever it should be brought into general domestic use instead

of flax, for common washing with soap and water will bleach the fibre a perfect white,

beautiful and glossy.
    The Bromelia Ananas, and Bromelia Pigna, also the Karatto fibres, are all of the

 different qualities of BromeliacecB, or the pine-apple tribe. It appears the pine-apple

 was first introduced into India by the Portuguese ; it has now become so naturalized
 as to appear indigenous : it grows in enormous quantities in various parts of India
 indeed so plentiful, that a boat load of the fruit has been sold for one rupee, or two

 shillings, at Sincapoor and Malacca.

gveatly does this wool resemble the sheep's wool, as to deceive some of the best judges

in England.

    The fibre is long in staple, and by the two sticks now shown, and which were hacicled
by the Messrs. Marshalls and Messrs. Hives and Atkinson, proof is afforded how well it
is adapted for flux-spinning machinery ; and when flax spinners shall provide warps of
this material, cotton warps might be dispensed with, and a warp of great strength be
introduced, which so corresponds with all the essentials of real wool, that when mixed
with wool, they will both take the same dyes, mill and dress together, and will certainly

manufacture a good cloth.

   The flax of India, according to Dr. Roxburgh, is mostly cultivated on account of
its seed, and the part which in most other countries is most valued, is there thrown
away. The Belfast Chamber of Commerce observes, that as India annually exports
nearly 100,000 quarters of seed to Great Britain and Ireland, it has been calculated

that the plants producing this quantity of seed would yield annually at least 12,000

tons of fibre, value say £500,000, all of which now goes to waste. There can be no
doubt, therefore, that the question is one of immense importance not only to this
country, which requires such immense quantities of flax fibre, but to India, which
produces such enormous supplies of seeds, and is supposed to waste so much of valuable
exportable material. There can be no doubt that the very best flax may be produced
in India, and always at a remunerating price; for labour there is so plentiful and
cheap, that whatever may be the extent of cultivation entered into, there need be no
fear of being undersold by anj' nation upon earth. It has been said, that if any party
in India could supply this kingdom with 100,000 tons of Indian flax at this time, he
might go on shipping as fast as he could, and never feel the least fear of overstocking

the market. Instructions have been given for a considerable supply of four of the

different India fibres.

   The silk of the wild silk-worm ought to be noticed, as the fibre or thread is fifteen

tunes stronger than that of the common silk. No doubt it will be of importance (o

manufacturers of what is called spun silk, as by proper looking after, an immense
quantity, now completely neglected, might be collected and brought to be of great

advantage to them.
   India produces some 200 varieties of fibres for examination, and it is to be hoped

for future use in Europe. The India House Museum contains specimens, not only of

--these, but of every article of raw and cultivated produce of India, minerals, gums,

dyes, woods, and cereals, and specimens of all the textile fabrics and works of art and

taste : the whole are open to the inspection of the public, and manufacturers can
obtain any desired information upon application.

   Mr. Dickson of Leeds has a case of prepared Indian fibres in the Exhibition of

Local Industry.

   For elaborate, complete, and instructive papers upon India fibres, reference may be
made to vol. ii. of the Transactions of the Society of Arts, p. 366, and to vol. v. p. 17,

where the lamented Dr. Royle will be found to have nearly exhausted the subject.

An Essay on Distinctions between Money and Capital, Interest and Discount,

   Currency and Circidating 3Iedium, essential to be observed in the Reform

  of our Monetary Laws. By Hamer Stansfeld.

   The author sets out by stating that his ideas are not ofl!ered as the speculations of
a profound political economist, but as the attempt of a merchant (retired from busi-
ness on the ground of health) to account for monetary convulsions, and to find, if
possible, some means of mitigating their frequency and severity. The conclusions at

--which he arrives as to the distinctions between money and capital, and between in-

terest and discount, are thus summed up : That money is a certificate of value, and
may be the product of either capital or credit. That capital is the product of labour
alone. That money is a security for obtaining and transferring at all times its equi-

valent specified value in capital or in any kind of wealth. That capital is that portion
of wealth which is used in reproduction, and is the object of transfer through the
medium^ of money. That debts are contracted in money, and not in capital. That

interest is, iu a great degree, a charge made for the risk of lending money on credit.
--198 REPORT 1858.

That discount is the allowance made for paying off that charge for credit with ready
money.

   That interest may be given either as a remuneration for the use of the capital trans-
ferred by the money, or for tlie use of money itself

    That discount is given only for the use of money itself.
    That the rate of interest depends on the demand and supply of capital, and on the

 degree of risk incurred.

    That the rate of discount depends on the supply and demand of ready money, and
and on the degree of risk incurred ; and as in this country provincial bank notes are
convertible on demand into legal tender money, the rate of discount here fundament-
ally depends at present on the demand and supply of legal tender money.

    To the question, What is currency ? the writer replies, " Coin and bank notes ;" but he

points out that these form only a small portion of the great wheel of circulating medium,
which embraces ci-edit and every thing that is a medium for circulating value. " The
 amount w; currency in circulation in the wholesale trade is, in relation to the aggre-
 gate of circulating medium, but as a drop in the ocean of credit on which it is carried."
 Hence the writer asks, " Must not the attempt by law to adjust the circulating meduun
 and prices, by regulating the amount of bank notes, be as futile as the endeavour to
 regulate the ocean and its tide by damming up the streams?" The final conclusion
 at which Mr. Stansfeid arrives is, " That were the laws of nature not counteracted by
 the laws of man, but left as free in their action on money as on capital ; and were the
 duty of the legislature confined to the taking care of the quality of the currency, by
 ensuring the convertibility of the bank note, leaving the quantity to take care of itself,
 the enormous disproportion between the amount of credit liabilities and ready money
 would be diminished, and the frequency and severity of monetary panics would be

 mitigated, if not entirely averted."

 On the Sewing Machine in Glasgow, and its Effects on Production, Prices,
                    and Wages. By John Strang, LL.D.

     Dr. Strang mentioned the different kinds of sewing machines, with the various
 improvements that had been effected in those implements. The cost of the best

 machines now in use varied from £,2b to .^30 each, and some were produced of an
 inferior kind in America so low as \Qs. each. The better class of machines now in
 use were calculated to make almost everything formerly executed by the needle or
 even awl, and it was affirmed that the finer or more difficult the work, the more benefit
 from the machine. One of the latest improved machines would complete a thousand
 stitches in a minute, and the use of the instrument was becoming moi-e and more
 general throughout the great manufacturing marts of the world. The important
 question then arose, had the introduction of sewing machines interfered with hand
 labour, and if so, to what extent? Limiting the inquiry to Glasgow, where the

 introduction of sewing machines has been recent and their adoption rapid, there being
 at present about 900 at work in that city. Dr. Strang stated that while these machines
 had greatly increased the power and facility of production, and consequently lowered
 the price of the manufactured article, they had only displaced the most unprofitable
 portion of hand needle-work, and had indeed tended rather to increase than to diminish

 the wages of those engaged in this sphere of labour. Among other instances of this

 he stated that the wages of a handy female attending each machine were from Is. to
  lOs. per week, whereas a mere sempstress could scarcely earn half that sum, and
  that, too, through long protracted labour.

     Dr. Strang showed by an elaborate array of statistical facts, the present and pro-
 jected water supply of some of the leading towns of the Western world, witl;^ the

 extent and cost of such supply. He glanced at some of the social disadvantages, and
 even evils, which have arisen, or may still further arise, from rendering water the too

 easy agent for the removal of impurities which should be transported otherwise, and

 thus converting many once pellucid streams, upon which cities are foundedj into

periods of imprisonment are inflicted, and the frequency with which previous con-
victions are overlooked ; and though high authorities have seen insuperable difficul-

ties in the way of establishing any fixed ride, he insisted upon the possibility of some

better system being devised. At present it is a lottery of punishments, which ought

not to exist. He then took up the Juvenile Offenders' Acts. For the administration
of these, he showed that we have the guidance of principles carefully and rationally

defined by Mr. Barwick Baker of Hardwicke, whose experience and unwearied
attention to the subject give him the weight of authority. The course Mr. Baker
proposes is, with rare exceptions, to inflict for a first offence 7 days' imprisonment
for a second offence 14 days, with (invariably) the Reformatory. Should it fail in
its effect, he recommends that, on a relapse into crime, the offender should be sent
to the quarter sessions, where he may be sentenced to penal servitude ; and for this
mode of treatment satisfactory reasons are adduced. Yet what is the practice ?
The terms of imprisonment, coupled with a sentence to reformatory discipline (which
is often reserved for a third or even a fourth offence), vary from a week up to the
maximum of three months, frequently without any perceptible reason juvenile offenders

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

are dealt with, both at petty sessions aad at the police courts, as though the Acta

had no existence ; and when reformatory discipline has failed, and fresh crimes have
been committed, instead of sending the offender to be treated as Mr. Baker recom-

mends, the mischievous system of repeated short imprisonments is, too often, again
resorted to. In proof of it, several examples were cited. Returns were also referred
to in evidence of the partial manner in which the law had hitherto been carried into
effect as respects the contributions to be levied upon parents towards the support of
their children while under detention. It was inferred from ofBcial papers, that the

number of parents actually contributing was not a third of those who might be com-

pelled to do so.

   But whatever may have been the errors committed in applying the law, it is will-

ingly allowed that there can be no doubt as to the beneficial effects of the reformatory
system in the diminution of crime. Mr. Tartt gave sufficient facts to prove that, out

of 100 boys, 50 may be considered as reclaimed; 25 only as certainly bad ; and the
remainder are either middling, doubtful, or lost sight of. As regards its individual
effects, all this (he observed) is very satisfactory ; indeed it would be so if we reduced

our estimate of the successes by one half; and, in other respects, the good effects

were equally shown. When it was the practice to sentence juvenile offenders to two

or three weeks' imprisonment, they were, on the expiration of their terms, usually
met or welcomed by their former companions, and were reconducted to the haunts
and habits from which they would, often, have been willingly freed. The conse-
quence was a continued course of petty crime, followed by punishments repeated
with more or less frequency, according to the degree of vigilance in the police or of
dexterity in the criminal. Since it has been permitted to send them to a reformatory,
society is relieved from their depredations during the time of their detention ; the
schools and associations for crime are broken up ; and even if the individual is not
reclaimed, he is generally removed from the scene of his former pursuits ; or is
relieved by employment, either at home or abroad, from immediate temptation. That
the aggregate of crime has thus been lessened there cannot be a doubt. The Judi-

cial Statistics, prepared at the Home Office, and several other returns, were cited in

evidence. In connexion with his subject, Mr. Tartt referred to the ' Report on
Criminal Returns,' which he presented to the Section at last year's meeting. The
introduction of changes (he observed) is slowly admitted, partly on account of the
difficulty they present in comparing previous with succeeding years, and partly on
account of the official arrangements not being sufficiently extensive for the superin-
tendence of more extensive work ; but he again urged the adoption of two of the
 suggestions contained in the Report ; one of them, the careful distinction between
resident and non-resident offenders ; the other, the establishment of something similar
to the Casiers Judiciaires in France, for acquiring better knowledge than we can obtain
at present of a criminal's antecedents. Whatever tended to an improved knowledge
and classification of the criminal, would assist in the suppression of crime.

            MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

On the Progress of Mechanical Scie?ice. Address by the President.

In opening the business of the Section, I have to congratulate you upon the en-

couraging prospects which our meeting in this great mart of industry is calculated to

afford. This large and important district is only just recovering from a state of

intense excitement and a burst of loyalty that has reverberated from one extremity of

the Riding to the other. In these rejoicings I have naturally taken a deep interest,

and, now that the royal visit is over, a meeting for the extension of science and use-

ful art is probably the most appropriate conclusion of the festivities which have

occupied the attention of this town for the last two weeks.

On a former occasion, when I had the honour of occupying this chair, I endeavoured

to combine in a condensed form a review of such improvements in mechanical science

as had been effected during the successive intervals between the Annual Meetings of

this Association, and, conceiving that a short account of what has taken place during

the last few years may not be unacceptable, I have on this, as on previous occasions,

ventured to direct your attention to a succinct retrospect of what I consider new and

valuable in mechanical art.

In Mechanical Science and General Engineering this country continues to main-

tain its high position in new developments and continued progress, and the almost

innumerable patents weekly taken out under the new law are remarkable indications

of the activity and inventive powers of this country. It is not yet thirty j'sars since

the introduction of malleable iron as a material for ship-building took place, and

a much shorter time has elapsed since it was first applied to the construction of

Webridges.  have all of us heard of the Tubular system so successfully applied to

the bridges across the Conway and Menai Straits ; now it is extensively employed in

every quarter of the globe, and there is no span within the limit of one thousand feet

but what might be compassed by the hollow girder bridge with security and effect.

These discoveries are of immense importance to mankind, and where they are carried

out with skill and a strict adherence to sound principles of economy and science, they

give to the engineer of the present day a power which in former times it was impos-

sible to realize.

  --Steam Navigation. In this department of practical science, although much has

been done, yet much remains to be accomplished in giving to the iron ship uniformity
of strength and security of construction. With respect to vessels of such complex form,
bounded by such a variety of curved surfaces, we are yet much uninformed as to the
precise points of application of the material, in order to attain the maximum of
strength combined with lightness and economy in the distribution of the material.

These are data yet to be ascertained, and it will require long and laborious experimental

researches before the facts are clearly known and established ; much has, however,
been accomplished in the absence of these data, and I may safely refer to that noble
structure the. Leviathan, which, with all her misfortunes, is nevertheless a most mag-
nificent specimen of naval architecture. The Cellular system, so judiciously introduced
by Mr. Brunei, is her great source of strength, and I am persuaded that she will stand
the test (which 1 have recommended in other cases) of being suspended upon the two

extreme points of stern and stern with all her machinery on board ; or, these conditions

being reversed, I believe she may be poised upon a point in the middle like a scale-

beam, without fracture or injury to the material of which she is composed; her cellular
construction and double sheathing round the hull, and the same formation on the
upper deck, give to the vessel enormous power of resistance, and her division and

subdivision by bulkheads ensures a large margin of security in whatever circumstances
                                                                 ;

she may be placed. In fact, she may be considered as a large hollow girder requiring

a load of nearly 10,000 tons suspended from the centre to break her. I mention this

to show that her want of success is not due to any fault in the ship herself, but to the
magnitude of the speculation as a commercial transaction, and her unmanageable

character in regard to the shipment of cargo, and similar difficulties which she may

be called upon to encounter. I hope, however, that the necessary funds will be
forthcoming to complete her equipment, and that we shall yet see her dashing aside

   Raihuays. The magnitude of this great Republic (as it is called) of speculation
Weand industry is scarcely, if ever, appreciated by the public.
                                                                 look at the locomotive

of the present day, or glide by its means over the surface of the earth, without once

thinking of the amount of skill and capital expended in the production of such vast

and important results. At the present moment we learn, from returns recently pub-

lished, that we have in this country alone 9i00 miles of railway, executed and in

actual operation, and taking at a rough calculation one locomotive engine with a

force of 200 horses' power to every three miles of railway, and assuming each to run

120 miles a day, we thence calculate the distance travelled over by railway trains to

be equal to 380,000 miles per diem, or the enormous distance of 1 38 millions of miles
per annum, a space measuring the distance of the planets, and beyond the conception
of those unacquainted with the measurements of the astronomer. To transport en-

gines and trains this distance, requires a force equivalent to that of upwards of 200,000

horses in constant operation throughout the year.

As regards the commercial value of railways, it will not be necessary to enlarge

upon it in this place ; suffice it to observe, that a clear revenue of 12 millions is left

after all expenses are paid, for distribution amongst shareholders and creditors. This

amounts to 3f per cent, per annum, a small return upon 320 millions, the original
cost of 9500 miles of railway, or an average of ^34,000 per mile.

In the locomotive engine "there has been no improvement of importance during the

last two years, excepting only its adaptation to the burning of coal instead of coke
without the production of smoke ; to a certain extent this has been successfully accom-
plished, but the process is still far from perfect. Superior training is wanted for
engineers and stokers before we can look forward with certainty to the time when

the use of coal will become general, with increased economy and with the suppression

of the nuisance of smoke.

   In the formation of the permanent way considerable improvements have been
effected, especially in the joining of the rails by what is technically termed the fish
joint, which secures a more perfect union of the rails, produces a smoother surface,
and diminishes the wear and tear of the rolling stock, when compared with the old

system of joining so sensibly felt in carriages running over the line at great velo-

--cities.
   Manufactures. For the last twelve months great depression has existed in this
department of the national industry, and, notwithstanding the attempts to cheapen
the production of the staple articles of manufacture by the introduction of improved

machinery, there exists a considerable depression in many of the great marts of

industry. This is probably to be attributed to the disturbed state of India and China
but, looking at the activity of the manufacturing population, and the amount of
capital employed, there has been no serious diminution in the production of manu-

factured articles, nor any stagnation in the demand for labour. On the contrary, I

believe, with the exception of the causes just alluded to, that the manufactures of

this country generally were never in a more flourishing condition.

   In the iron trade, with which this Section is more immediately connected, there has
been a similar but slight depression, the manufacture of pig, plates and bars being
as great as in any former year ; and, taking into account the improved process by

which malleable iron and steel are now produced, there is reason to hope for a greatly
increased demand and an enlarged production. In fact, such have been the improve-
ments since Mr. Bessemer first announced his new process of boiling the crude iron
direct from the smelting furnace, and dispensing with the puddling process, that we

appear to be now in a state of transition from the old system of smelting, refining,
and puddling, to a more direct, continuous, and improved process of manufacture.

   Steel bars and plates are now made without the intervention of an intermediate
                                                                                                                                           ;

                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                    203

and tedious process, and we may reasonably look forward to the introduction of an

entirely new article of manufacture of greatly increased powers of resistance to strain.

Although hitherto Mr. Bessemer has not succeeded in producing malleable iron by his

new process, he has made excellent refined iron, and has stimulated others to attempts

at improvement in the same direction. His discoveries, first given to the world through

this Section, have already proved of great value to the community, and we look for-

--ward with confidence to the introduction of still greater improvements improve-

ments by which steel plates and bars will be produced at almost the same price as

--that for which we can now obtain the best manufactured iron.
    The Machinery of Agriculture. This is a branch of mechanical art which requires

the careful consideration of the mechanician and the engineer. The time appears to

have arrived when the introduction of machinery, combined with the wide diffusion

myof education, is absolutely required amongst our agricultural population ; and in

opinion, increased intelligence, together with new machinery, will double the produc-

tion of the soil and improve the climate in which we live. Much has already been done,

Weyet very much is yet to be accomplished.             must persevere in the new process of

deep draining and subsoil ploughing, and in the substitution of steam power in

place of horse and manual labour, before we can realize such large and important

advantages as are now before us. Great changes and improvements have been

effected in my own time by the introduction of new implements to relieve the labours

of the farm. Everj'thing, cannot, however be done by the mechanician and engineer

much has yet to be accomplished by the farmer in the preparation of the land to ren-

der it suitable for machine culture, and a willing heart as well as a steady hand is

required of the agriculturist before he can work for the public good in concert with
the engineer. The reaping machine has now attained such a degree of perfection as

to  bring  it  into  general  use on  lands  prepared  for its  reception                                            and  the  steam  plough
                                                                                                                  ;

is making rapid strides towards perfection, and is likely to take the place of horses,

and effect a change as beneficial to the farmer as it will be advantageous to the public

at large.

 --Electric Telegraphs. The consummation of telegraphic communication between

the old and new world is the crowning triumph of the age, and I hail in common with

every lover of science the immense benefits which the successful laying of the Atlantic

Cable is calculated to secure for mankind ; it is another step forwards in the great
march of civilization, and the time is not far distant when we shall see individuals as
well as nations united in social intercourse through the medium of the slender wire

and the electric current. These are blessings which the most sanguine philosophers

of the past never dreamed of ; they are the realizations of the age in which we live ; and
I have to congratulate the Section on what has already been done in the wide, and
to some extent unexplored field of this wonderful discovery.

    On a neto Method of constructing the Permanent Way and Wheels of
                      Raihoays. By W. Bridges Adams.

   The object of the improvement about to be described is to obtain all the advantages
of both the bridge-rail and the double T-rail, while avoiding their disadvantages

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

that is, the horizontal stiffness of the bridge-rail with more than the vertical stiffness

of the double T-rail, with a lowered elevation, without any chairs or loose contact of
iron with iron, and with the firmest joint yet produced, making the line of rails a
continuous yet expansive and contractile bar, on a continuous bearing.

   In this new construction the ordinary double-headed rail is not placed in chairs
on cross sleepers, but is bolted between longitudinal sleepers of small scantling, which
supply the place of cast chairs, by continuous wooden supports. The bolts are either
ordinarj' screw-bolts or pieces of flat bar, with keys and washers passing through both
rails and timbers at 3-lcet spaces. The rail is thus supported by the upper table
without resting on the lower, and the bearing surface on the timber is in a yard length
equal to 54 inches, the chair in the same length being only equal to 48 inches ; the
former being continuous, the latter discontinuous. The bearing surface on the bal-

last is equal to that of the cross-sleeper rail with the sleepers 3 feet apart. The

height of the rail above the ballast is only 5 inches, while that of the ordinary cross-

sleeper way is 12 inches. There is, therefore, a saving of half the ballast. The rail -

are connected by brackets of angle-iron, which are bolted to and through both rails
and brackets at the joints, the brackets being bolted down on cross sleepers at the

--joints ; thus securing the gauge.
   The advantages of the system are, 1st, a maximum depth of rail, with a minimum

elevation ;  2nd, a continuous bearing on timber ;  3rd,  great  lateral  stiffness                                4th, a
                                                                                                                ;

really reversible rail without risk of damage or crystallization, with the lower table

perfect, when the upper is worn out ; 5th, great safety, by reason of the rail being
secured without chairs and keys ; 6th, diminished cost of maintenance, and rapid

shifting of rails.

As to the wheel, practically, a driving wheel, at 50 miles per hour, is equivalent

to a large Nasmyth's hammer, wherever any inequality exists between rails and

wheel : the incessant leap of the wheel from point to point is a heavy blow.
   To obviate this disadvantage, it is desirable to render the wheel elastic. The im-

proved wheel is so constructed, that a continuous hollow in the internal periphery of

the tire is overlapped by a continuous hoop-spring, on which the wheel rests in such
a mode that the only dead-weight is in the tire. The tire is formed with an internal
front rib ; and when the wheel is forced in upon the spring by cold pressure, a false
rib is fixed at the back, and the wheel is secure. The wheel thus treads on an elastic

cushion all round the periphery. It cannot be strained on mischievously tight, as by

shrinking hot ; and the metal is in a state of rust.
   The advantage in saving wear of tire is found to be considerable, and it is obvious

the saving must extend to the rails also.
   The commercial advantages are considerable. In the permanent way the cost of

the whole of the chairs is saved, and a portion of the timber, while the fastenings are
about the same cost in either case. The saving of labour, and heating, and tools in

the construction of the wheels is considerable ; and the quantity of material is dimi-

nished. Both permanent way and wheels have now been a considerable time in

practical use, which is extending as the system becomes known.

On a few Facts connected with the Manufacture of Pig Iron in the neighbour-

                     hood of Leeds. By W. J. Armitage.

The author first quoted an extract from the 'Geological Survey,' in reference to the

peculiarities of the coal-fields of Yorkshire, and then proceeded to point out the posi-

tion occupied by the valuable seam of coal in the districts of Bradford and Leeds.

--The superficial seams of coals worked in the immediate neighbourhood of Leeds he

gave in the various orders in which they occur:

1st. The stone or cannel bed.       2nd. The Middleton bed.

3rd. The Beeston thin bed.          4th. The Beeston thick bed.

5th. The Crow coal.

Below the latter seam, that portion of the strata especially connected with the

Amanufacture of iron in the North Yorkshire district was arrived at.          section of

this part of the strata gave the following results :
       1st. Loose vein of sandstone, 9 to 18 feet thick.
       2nd. Black bed ironstone, lying in a bed of shale, 3 to 4 feet thick.

3rd. Black bed coal, 2 feet thick.
4th. Various measures of shale and stone, roof of better bed coal, consisting of

          black shale, with numerous fish remains, and small white nodules of

             ironstone, 120 feet.

5th. Better bed coal, 1 to 2 feet.

        6th. Floor of indurated fire-clay, 2 to 3 feet.

From this portion of the strata, comprised within the short space of forty yards, the
materials employed in the manufacture of the iron were derived. The black bed
ironstone furnished the ore, the better bed coal the fuel, the black bed was used for
the engines, and from the valuable bed of fire-clay were made the fire-bricks and
blast-furnace linings. The ironstone occurred in detached nodules of various sizes,
deposited in five distinct layers, which were designated top balls, flat stone, upper
rough measure, middle balls, and lower rough measure. In some localities their
course was difficult to trace in the surrounding shale ; in others, where the seam
·was termed good, the ore produced 1000 tons of stone per acre, and this was about

the average yield at Farnley, The fracture of this stone showed a blackish grey tint,

and yielded by analysis

Metallic iron                39'4 per cent.

Silica and alumina           14'9 per cent.

Sulphur                          -8 per cent.
                             44*9 per cent.
Oxygen, carbonic acid, &c

A singular affinity seems to exist between the ore and the better bed coal in this

district. The results obtained from other descriptions of stone have not been satis-
factory. With respect to the fuel employed, the better bed coal burnt free from

sulphur, and, as this was one of the chief obstacles in the manufacture of iron in this
country, such a coal was a great desideratum. Mr. Wood, of Leeds, had lately

--analysed one sample of this coal, and the following were the results :

Carbon                       74700

Hydrogen                     5'000

Sulphur                        ·196 (very small).

Ash                          4700

Oxygen and nitrogen          15 '404

                                                                                     lOO'OOO

Other analyses would have to be made on different samples of the coal before the
average amount of sulphur could be determined with precision, but this first essay
was satisfactory, inasmuch as it placed the better bed coal of this district in the
foremost rank amongst the pure coals of England ; and it was to the excellence of
this fuel, as observed in the memoir of the Geological Survey already referred to,
that the good quality of the iron manufactured at Low Moor, Bowling, and Farnley,
was mainly attributable. In conclusion, he referred to the points of importance in
connexion with the process of refining the pig metal at the Farnley Iron Works,
which were peculiar to that establishment. The first had reference to the introduc-
tion of steam into the refinery along with the blast ; the second was the introduc-
tion of steel into the refineries in conjunction with the pig metal. The refined metal
thus produced presented a pure silvery fracture, and a perfectly homogeneous texture.

        On Steam Tugs employed on the Aire and Calder Navigation.

                     By W. H. Bartholomew, M.I.C.E.

   The navigation to which the subject matter of this paper refers is a combination of
natural and artificial : throughout it has a navigable depth of 7 feet. The canals, or
artificial portion, have bottom and surface widths respectively of 25 to 30 feet, and 60

to 66 feet ; the sectional area of water-way varying from 3.50 to 380 superficial feet.
The locks, which occur at varying distances of from 9 to 2 miles, admit vessels of
dimensions not exceeding 64 feet long and 18 feet beam.

   An improved system of haulage was introduced in 1853 by the construction of a

steam tug (which had been followed by several others), designed with the combined
object of providing motive power for a train of boats and capability for carriage of
cargo. These tugs were in length 63 feet 6 inches, having beam respectively of 1 1 feet
and 12 feet 6 inches, depth of hold 7 feet 3 inches, immersed midship sections 64 and
72 square feet respectively, displacement with such immersion 40 tons for cargo, and 8
to 10 tons for machinery and stores. The engines and boilers were fixed in the after
portion of the boats, and occupied 20 feet of their length ; and 30 feet were devoted
to cargo and 12 feet 6 inches to accommodation for the crew. The remainder of the
length was taken up by bulkheads, stores, &c. The peculiar machinery of these boats
was next illustrated by a technical description and plans ; and the author then pro-
ceeded to show that by a new arrangement of the screw, adopted in other more recent
tugs, there was a considerably lower per-centage of " slip." This screw consisted of
two ordinary screws fixed on the same shaft at right angles, or otherwise, to each
other, having an intervening space of six or more inches between them, and conse-
quently their planes of rotation were different ; their pitches also varied, the after
screw having the greater. This application had proved to be most successful. In
working these tugs the pressure of steam was regulated to the duty to be performed,
and had varied from 100 lbs. to 220 lbs., but did not often exceed 160 lbs. per square
inch. The general speed of the engines was 180 revolutions, or 360 feet speed of
        --;

piston per minute. This speed of piston, when working at full pressure, gave 100
effective horse-power for the larger, and 50 horse-power for tugs of less power. The
former, under such circumstances, took a load of 500 tons of cargo, or a gross load of
650 tons at a speed of 3 miles per hour in the canals and 4^ miles in the river ])ortion
of the navigation. The latter hauled a load of 220 tons of cargo, or a gross load of

325 tons at the same speed in the canals, and 3| miles per hour in the river. On an

experiment with one of the more powerful tugs, twelve vessels, containing with the
cargo in the tug 832 tons, or a gross tonnage moved of 1222 tons, were taken in the
river portion of the navigation a distance of 4l miles in 11 hour, or, allowing for cur-

rent, 21 miles per hour. On another occasion the same tug took nine vessels, con-

taining with the tug 552 tons of cargo, or 852 tons gross, over the same portion of
the river (allowing for current), a speed of 4-87 miles per hour. The dynamical effect
on the tow-rope in the former case varied from 28 to 34 cwt., and in the latter ave-
raged about 27i cwt. These tugs v»ere also very useful for breaking up and contending

--against ice ; and there was also a diminished consumption of fuel as compared with

the previous tugs employed, which were paddle-boats. The commercial results were
as follows : 9d. per boat per mile by the paddle tugs; 7d. by horse haulage, &c.
and 4'15fZ. by screw tugs. The economic proportionals were consequently 1, 1-68
and 2-15. The trip of 36 miles was thereby accelerated two hours, and increased

certainty was obtained.

            Description of a Floating Dry Dock, By G. Ba yley.

   The dock in question was designed in 183(3 for a South American Government
it was intended to be moored in deep water, and ride with a ship of war in it with

safety during ordinary gales.

   The port, or rather open roadstead, in which it was proposed to place the floating
dock, had a rise of tide of about 6 feet. To meet the peculiarities of the place, it was
proposed to construct the dock so that it could be immersed or sunk down to any
depth that might be required to admit the ships of various classes, and be strong
enough to ride with them, without straining the ship.

   Three things had to be combined--strength, rigidity, and buoyancy. The needful
strength and rigidity were to be secured by a very simple system of bracing and
trussing, and the whole framing covered with planking well secured and made water-
tight. This space was subdivided longitudinally and transversely, so as to obviate
any risk from the rushing of the water from side to side or from end to end of the
dock ; and at the same time, these longitudinal and transverse partitions would add

to the strength and rigidity of the entire fabric.

  A transverse section of the dock would show that the floor of the dock is a framed

beam, consisting of two tie pieces about 4 feet apart, with queen posts in the centre,
under the ground or lower tier of keel blocks, with tie bolts introduced where neces-
sary. The sectional area must be proportioned to the entire weight of the dock with

the ship, so that, if desired, it may float with its upper internal surface above the
level of its external waters. The angular or rectangular space between the outer

and inner planking of the sides must be of sufficient volume to allow the dock to be
sunk to any required depth to receive the ship.

   The dock itself must be ballasted with sufficient weight to render it specifically
heavier than water, in order that it may be readily sunk to the required depth.

   It was proposed to have an engine fixed on the deck forward, to pump out the

water from the subdivisions, and also to drive saws and any other tools required

for carrying on the repairs*.
   It would be desirable to construct such docks of iron, which is peculiarly suited

to meet all the requirements of such structures as to strength, rigidity, and buoyancy,
at less cost than timber under almost every combination of circumstances.

   The peculiar advantage of the kind of dock now suggested is its adaptation to

places, where, from local circumstances, it is difficult, if not impossible, to build
secure and substantial dry docks on the shore.

   * The paper was illustrated by a model, showing the general construction and proposed
arrangement of the engine, pump, &c.

                      On an Instrument for describing Spirals.

                 By the Rev. James Booth, LL.D., F.R.S.

   This is the invention of Mr. Henry Johnson of Crutched Friars, and is called by

him a volutor, with reference to its practical use.

 --It admits of several varieties ; and the earliest form affords a simple illustration of

the principle of the spiral line, that is, of a line revolving round a point at one end,
as round a centre, while a niarking point travels, during the revolution, from the
inner end or centre to the outer end of the line. It consists of a vertical axis resting
on a horizontal plane, and retained on it by a metal point to prevent slipping or

lateral motion. To this upright axis is attached one extremity of the horizontal
arm or bar. The vertical axis passes through the extreme end of the horizontal
arm, or a block attached to the end of it, in such a way that the horizontal arm
may freely revolve round the vertical axis. The remote extremity of the horizontal
bar is furnished with a drum or pulley, over which a chain or band passes.

   One end of this band is fixed to the centre upon a level with the pulley ; and

the other end of the chain or band, after passing over the pulley at the outer end of
the horizontal rod, returns and is fastened to a slide upon the horizontal bar,
which carries a pencil or pen, and is placed at the inner extremity of the bar, close to

the vertical axis.

   The horizontal bar is caused to revolve ; and the band is thus wound round the
centre, and the slide, with its pencil, is drawn along the bar from the centre towards

--the pulley, the spiral curve traced upon the horizontal plane by the pencil being

the result of the compound motion of the point travelling along the revolving line.
The form of the centre, if cylindrical, would lead to a regular increase in the radius
of the spiral ; but by the substitution of grooved cones, any required ratio of increase
may be obtained.

  --A recent form of the instrument is even more simple than the one described, the

slide being dispensed with, and the pencil being attached to the horizontal bar,

which glides through a horizontal tube fixed to the lower part of the vertical centre.
The upper part of the vertical centre being a cone, with its handle is held stationary
by the hand, while motion is given to the lower part with the horizontal tube by a
small winch handle fixed on a wire descending through the cone and its handle.
The end of the bar bearing the marking pencil recedes from the centre as the outer

end is drawn towards the centre by the band wound round the vertical axis.
   To the horizontal tube and to the outer end of the bar are attached series of

puUej's ; and a variety of curves may be obtained by passing the band over two or
more pulleys, and thus dividing among several lines the effect of the band wound

round the centre.

On the Roof of the Neiv Town Hall at Leeds. By C. Brodrick, Architect.

The principal points which are worthy of notice in this roof are the absence of tie

beams, which allows of the ceiling of the hall being brought nearer to the exterior

of the roof than is usually the case. The roof consists of eight sets of principals

framed together. Each principal consists of a semicircular laminated rib, formed of

twelve l|^-inch planks, 9 inches wide, nailed together and fastened with wrought iron

bolts and straps. They are placed in couples, and stand immediately over each of

the columns in the hall. They are respectively 4 feet and 18 feet apart. The width

of the loom is 71 feet, and the springing of the ribs 53 feet from the ground. The

entire height to the top of the roof is 99 feet, the hall being 73 feet high in the clere.

This system of roofs has been adopted more frequently in France than in England, the

only one with which Mr. B. was acquaintedof any considerable size being the station of

the Great Northern Railway, at King's Cross, The laminated rib is the invention of a

French engineer. It was at first suggested for a bridge over the Rhine, in the year 1811.

EmySeveral years later, M.  constructed several roofs on this plan ; but all his roofs,

as well as the one at King's Cross, being very near to the ground at their springing,

and without ceilings, are consequently much more manageable than the roof of the
Town Hall, which has a very elaborate plaster ceiling attached to it, and the spring-

ing is at a considerable distance from the ground : he had taken the precaution to in-

sert several additional struts and braces as a preventive against any change of form

or outward thrust. Both these points had been attended with the most complete
success, there being not the least perceptible outward thrust or change of form since
they were put up. The latter fact was proved very satisfactorily by the plasterers,

who were enabled to run the mouldings on the ceiling from the centre. The brackets

for these mouldings were not gauged from a centre, but fastened to the ribs accord-

ing to their sizes. In constructing these semicircular ribs, he was much struck with
the small amount of springing or alteration of form. If the principle of these lami-
native ribs were better understood, he was of opinion that many of our church-

building architects would adopt it, instead of depending on three or four over-strained
joints for one tie.

Notice of some of the Articles shown in the Mechanical Section of the Leeds
                   Exhibition of Local Industry. JBy J. Buckton.

The following are some of the chief articles exhibited :

A fine collection of malleable iron, boiler ])lates, and angle-iron as used in ship-

building, locomotive crank and other axles, and wheel tires in various forms.

A. model of a weighing crane, designed for raising and weighing heavy goods at

one operation.

ANaylor's double steam hammer.     collection of engineers' tools.

A lathe for turning irregularly-formed pieces of wood, and an endless tape-saw

also the adaptation of Comb's expanding pulley to a drilling machine.

Kemp's woollen cloth dressing machinery.

Taylor's corn mill, with the upper stone stationary and the lower one revolving.

The stones are 2 feet 8 inches and 3 feet in diameter, weighing 3 cwt. to 5 cwt. each,

versus 15 cwt. to 20 cwt., the weight of ordinary millstones. The work is found to

be done much more effectually, at a reduced cost of masonry and building.

Carrett, Marshall, and Co. stationary pumping and other engines.

Comb's and Smallpage's new double cam power-loom. In this power-loom all

the movements for plain weaving are obtained from one shaft perfectly balanced in

itself and revolving at half the speed of the crank shaft of the old loom. In the

shuttle used in the loom, the weft is packed into the shuttle in the form of a hollow

roll, and drawn from the internal surface.

   Holmes' loom for working ladies' corsets without a seam ; it differs from the
ordinary way of weaving, by the yarn being on several pulleys in small quantities,

instead of all being on one beam.

Miller's card-setting machine.

Haste's new self-acting apparatus for preventing the explosion of steam boilers.

A working model of Donnisthorpe's wool-combing machine.

On some modern Appliances for Raising Water. By W. E. Carrett.

The author, after alluding to the various kinds of pumps in use, proceeds to describe

two combinations of the steam engine a.nA pump in direct action. In each case the

steam cylinder is directly over and in immediate communication with the pump

Abeneath.     comparatively slight transposition of detail would arrange these hori-

zontally, if required. The first described was a steam pump of the high pressure

transportable class, having a fly wheel and connecting rods to the crank shaft ; also

a modification of this for especial cases, where lightness and portability are requisite :
the other was a compound high and low pressure condensing steam engine, also

in direct communication with its pump, and of much larger proportions, used as a

·water- hft.

The chief object in view is simplicity and durability of parts, a quiet and noiseless

action, and, as far as possible, a superior duty effected with a minimum expenditure

of power. One important feature to be observed is the application of the suctional

and compressive air vessels in close proximity to the pumps, by which it is able to

fetch the water from any distance (of course within the limits determined by the friction

in the pipes), or from a depth not exceeding 29 feet, and to force it any required

height or distance.

The author then, by the aid of diagrams, explained these several machines.

On an Apparatus for laying down Submarine Telegraphic Cables.
                      By H. CONYKEAKE, C.E.

This invention consists in the construction of machinery composed of a resilient and

articulated series of segments or frames, which extend from the stern of a vessel

employed in the submerging of submarine telegraph cables, and over which machine

the cable is to be paid out, being delivered from a trumpet-mouth shaped congeries

of friction rollers, situated at the outer extremity of the frame furthest from the stern,

in which machinery the resiliency decreases gradually from that part of the apparatus
next to the stern, to the extreme outer end thereof. The articulated joints or seg-

ments of the apparatus are formed of frames, each frame, starting from the stern,

being smaller than that supporting it. Strong springs, such as coach-springs, fixed

to one frame and linked to the farther extremity of the vessel, are employed to give

resiliency to the articulations between each frame and that next to it, and the frame

furthest from the stern terminates in a semi-conoidal or trumpet-mouth shaped

debouchure, consisting of rings of friction rollers breaking joint with each other, and

so arranged as to present a rolling surface of moderate curvature to the escaping

cable, at whatever angle with the course of the ship if is compelled by side currents

or lee way to quit the apparatus.

Over this resilient and articulated series of frames is a rigid spur of wood or metal,

having suspended from it, outward, as many pulleys as there are joints in the appa-

Aratus last described. An equal number of pulleys is provided inboard.         rope or

chain is connected to the extremity furthest from the stave of each joint, then to a

spring, or not, as deemed necessary ; and then, passing over one of the outboard pul-

leys and one of the inboard, in the rigid beam is attached to a spring apparatus, so

arranged as to give a resiliency graduated according to the position of such particular

piece in the series.

   This spring apparatus consists of a series of wheels and axles. The resilient springs

act on the axles in each case, and the ropes or chains leading to the various parts of

the laying apparatus are attached to the wheels. The ratio of the diameter of the

wheel to the axle varies in each case, according to the amount of resiliency re-

quired by the particular joint or frame of the fishing-rod apparatus, with which such

wheel and axle are connected. Thus, as the delivery extremity of the apparatus is

required to be moved through a comparatively large space by the exertion of a com-

paratively small strain, the ratio of the wheel to the axle in the resilient apparatus

pertaining to this end frame is consequently greater than in that pertaining to any

of the frames nearer the stern ; and thus a graduated resilience is obtained.

                  On Expanding Pulleys. By Mr. Coo.mbe.

   This paper has been prepared at the request of Mr. Fairbairn, the President of the
Section, the pulley itself having been carefully examined by Frince Albert at the time

Aof his visit to the Exhibition of Local Industrj', and by him warn)ly approved.

pretty correct idea of these pulleys may be foiined by supposing two cones cut with
radial spaces alternating with solid parts, so that the solid parts in one may slide
freely into corresponding spaces in the other, in the direction of a common axis.
The sizes of these radial sections are so regulated, that when the two cones are put
together they form a grooved or V-pulley, the diameter of which varies according to
the position they occupy with regard to each other. The expanding pulleys were
first designed for the purpose of giving the varying motion to the bobbins in ilax and
tow roving frames, to which it is applicable with great advantage from the accuracy

of its action and the small space which it occupies.

account of all the inventions for reapingupon record uptothattime,Mr.Crosskill stated

that there were then three reaping machines capable of doing practical work : the two
American reapers known as Hussey's and McCormack's, which came over to the

Great Exhibition of 1851 ; and the Scotch machine called Bell's (after its originator,
a minister in Fifeshire), which was brought into general notice, and subsequently

into practical operation, by Mr. William Crosskill, of Beverley. Since the year

1853 these three machines have been greatly improved, to adaptthem to the require-

ments of British agriculture ; Hussey's by Messrs. W. Dray and Co., McCormack's

by Messrs. Burgess and Key, and Bell's at Beverley, under the direction of the

reader of the paper ; and, by means of numerous working models and drawings, the
construction and peculiarities of these three machines were fully explained and illus-

trated. With reference to the cutting apparatus, it was remarked that numerous

endeavours have been made from time to time to supersede the reciprocating motion

given to the knives of the reaper, as it is a considerable source of loss of power, and

causes a tremulous vibration, resulting in excessive wear and tear. All attempts

have, however, hitherto failed to produce an efficient cutter, with a continuous

motion, and in his (Mr. Crosskill's) opinion they were not likely to succeed, as actual

experience in the harvest field seemed to prove that the reciprocating or reverse

motion is necessary to prevent the guards and knives from being choked with short

straw, grass, weeds, and similar substances. The convenient disposal or delivery of the

cut corn has been the greatest difficulty to encounter in bringing the reapers into

general use in this country. Two of them are, however, made to deliver the crop in

swathes, ready for taking up and binding ; and from the third the corn is removed in

sheaves by a man who rides on the machine. Various ingenious plans have from time
to time been brought forward for delivering the cut corn. Of these an excellent model,

from Messrs. Ransome and Sims, Ipswich, was exhibited of Atkin's automaton self-

acting rake, and a description given of the Britannia reaper, which was sent over

from America this summer, to Mr. Samuelson, of Banbury. The different methods

of attaching the horses, either by making them follow the machine, or walking by

the side of the corn to be cut, were fully pointed out, and the advantages of each

plan stated in detail. Makers and users of reaping machines are divided in opinion

as to which is the best way ; both have many warm advocates, and will probably

continue to be used according to the different circumstances under which the ma-

chines are employed. In offering some remarks on the practical use of reaping

machinery, Mr. Crosskill said it was necessary to direct attention to the variable and

Auncertain nature of the work it has to perform.  week of heavy rain before har-

vest will lay the corn in some districts so that it can scarcely be mown with the

scythe, and is rendered quite unfit for the action of machinery ; in moderately favour-

able seasons, however, the reapers, as at present constructed, are capable of render-

ing important assistance to the farmer. The use of both reaping machines with self-
acting delivery is steadily extending, and, as agriculturists and their men become

more accustomed to them, their introduction is likely to become still more rapid, for,

owing to the high price of labour during the harvest, they effect a considerable saving
in the cost of cutting the crop, and enable the farmer to take more advantage of

favourable weather than he can do by the uncertain aid of the limited number of men

that are to be procured at that period of the year. It was also worthy of a remark

in connexion with this part of the subject, that, excepting the locomotive engine,

there is no machine in use which requires to be manufactured with so much care and

regard to durability as the reaper. Almost all other machines used either in agriculture

or manufactures do their work when at rest, and secured to substantial foundations.

Even those constructed to move from place to place are, before being put in motion,

fastened down, to prevent as far as possible the destructive consequences of oscilla-

tion and vibration. The reaper is, on the contrary, not only exposed to all the strains

consequent on passing over every description of uneven ground with its machinery

in action, but is also subject to the effects of a continual tremulous vibration, caused

by the quick reciprocating motion of the knives. It was therefore not surprising

that the introduction of reaping machines has been attended with considerable

difficulties, especially as they have had to be worked by men but little accustomed to

the use of machinery ; in this respect, however, the last few years had witnessed a
great change. The assistance of the steam-engine was already felt by most farmers

to be a necessity in carrying out all extensive operations with efficiency and economy

and the general use of improved machinery would not fail to produce a corresponding
improvement in the condition of the agricultural labourer, and to accelerate the com-
pletion of that progressive revolution, which, since the abrogation of legislative pro-
tection, has been rapidly taking place in every department of practical agriculture.

                 On Double Cylinder Expansion 3Iarine Engines.

                                    By J. Elder.

   These engines are constructed with the view of getting the greatest amount of
power from a given quantity of steam at a given pressure, with less total weight of
engines, boilers, and water, and occupying less total space than that occupied by the
ordinary class of steam engines on board steam-ships; these engines are therefore
expected to have the following properties ;

  --1. That with these engines a steam-ship can steam the greatest distance pos-

sible with a given quantity of coals.

 --2. That a given distance can be performed in the shortest time, on account of the

small weight of coals necessary to be carried.

 --3. That the greatest amount of cargo and passenger accommodation is obtained,

from the small room occupied by the boilers and coals.

 --4. That where a given capacity of cargo and passenger accommodation is re-

quired, a smaller and consequently less expensive ship is necessary.

   5.--The boilers, being less than the usual proportion, are less expensive to replace
when required.

  --6. The number of firemen and stokers is reduced, and, consequently, the space

occupied by them can be otherwise engaged, and their wages saved.
   To accomplish these objects, the constructors of these engines have followed the

course we now describe. The cylinder capacity is so great as to admit of the steam

being expanded to within two pounds of the pressure in the condenser, at the end of
the stroke, while the engines are working full power. In order to reduce the shock
of high pressure on such a large piston, a cylinder with a piston one third the size is
placed close to it. This small cylinder receives the steam direct from the boiler during
one-third of its stroke, and is then cut off; this steam is consequently reduced to one-
third of its original pressure at the end of its stroke, and then enters the second
cylinder, where it is expanded three times more : thus 361bs. steam is expanded to
4lbs., viz. from 36 to 12 in the first, it then enters the second at 12 and is expanded
to 4lbs. ; but, as the second piston is three times the size of the first, the load will be

the same on both pistons, and the piston rods, cross heads, and connexion rods may

be duplicates of each other. The steam and eduction slide valves are wrought with
eccentrics. The steam valve is a gridiron with large flap ; the eduction valve, which
serves for both cylinders, has no lap, and the eduction ports remain open during the
entire stroke of the piston, thereby giving a free egress for the steam, and ample

escape for water, should it form.

    In reversing the engines the eccentrics are made to overrun the shaft till they arrive

--at the backing catch a plan which is less likely to cause accident than the ordinary

methods. The cylinders are steam-jacketed completely, and then covered with felt
and wood. There is a small engine pump for forcing the distilled fresh water from

 the jackets into the boilers, or to the fresh-water tanks, if necessary.

    The boilers now being made for such engines are tubular, with three large super-

 heating uptakes, 2 feet in diameter and 15 feet high, leading up through an oval
 steam chest to the funnel ; this makes a strong form of take-up, where it joins the
 tube plate, especially in boilers firing across the ship. The feed-pipe of the boilers

 has twelve spiral convolutions inside the funnel to heat the feed-water. This may
 be shut off when desirable.

    The author then mentions the various vessels in which these engines have been
 fitted, and shows by comparison with other engines the great saving of expense,
 combined with greater efficiency.

       A Description of a Hand Heliostat. By F. G Alton, S.G.S.

    By this simple instrument the rays of the sun could be flashed with ease and pre-
 cision upon any required spot. The appearance it produced was that of a brilliant

and glistering star, and its power was sufficient to arrest the notice of the most care-

less person at ten miles' distance. No sky line was necessary to the distinctness of

this remarkable signal, as is the case with semaphores and flags; indeed it was
visible to the greatest advantage in front of a dark or hazy background. It could
be used with equal facility from any spot where the sun's rays reached it, as from
between the trees of a forest or from a boat, as well as from a mast-head or a hill-top.
It had another peculiarity, in being enabled to flash its messages in perfect secrecy,
except to those who happened to be stationed in the narrow path along which they

were sent. Many occasions would arise, especially in war time, where this invention

would be of use. If the signaller was ignorant of the whereabouts of his correspond-
ent, he must sweep the horizon with his flash until it had been seen, and a response
elicited. For a more detailed description of this instrument, see the Proceedings of

Section A.

      On the Economy of Water-Power. By Joseph Glvnn, F.R.S.

    In this part of England, and in other manufacturing districts where coal is found, the
steam engine will generally be preferred to all other kinds of motive power ; but in

many parts of the British empire, more especially in Scotland and Ireland, coal is
scarce and water is abundant, and is now too often allowed to run to waste where
its application to turn mills and to work machinery for farming purposes might save

both time and money.
   Those machines produced at the Paris Exhibition, to which the writer would more

particularly allude, are the horizontal water-wheels, some of which were wrongly
named Turbines, whereas they were really substitutes for the machines so called.

   The Turbine is a machine of re-action, from which the water issues in jets, and
the unbalanced pressure opposite the orifice impels the machine and causes it to re-

volve in the opposite direction. It requires considerable skill in its construction,

and careful attention when in use ; but the horizontal water-wheel is a much more
simple machine, and much less liable to derangement. The water drives round a

fan with curved vanes, having a vertical axis and revolving in an iron case, the water

escaping at the centre.

   The horizontal water-wheels in the French Exhibition consisted of two parts, or
wheels, placed horizontally on a vertical axis, one wheel immediately above the other.

The upper part or wheel is fixed, and serves to direct the water into the buckets of

-- --the lower one, that is to say, the real water-wheel, which revolves, and the axle

or spindle revolves with it.

   The regulators, which determine the quantity of water and the speed of the wheel,
may vary in almost every instance, some being mere wooden sluices, some being metal
plates pierced with apertures like a ventilator, and some of stout leather strengthened
with iron plates, fitting on conical rollers and radiating from the axis. Some of these
wheels are very powerful, and carry a spur-wheel upon the vertical axis, surrounded
by six pairs of millstones for grinding corn, driven by pinions in the usual way
other wheels, of smaller size and greater speed, drive a single pair of millstones, with-
out the intervention of other mechanism, the axis of the water wheel being also the

spindle of the mill-stone.

   The mechanical effect of these machines, when carefully made, is said to equal
that of an over-shot or breast wheel. Some realize 75 per cent.

     On the Cause of Stemn-loilei- Explosions, and 3Ieans of Prevention.

                                By J. HopKiNSON.

   The author in this paper shows the necessity of increased attention to the form and
construction of steam boilers. After noticing the hay-stack, waggon, Cornish, and
Butterly boilers, he very fully describes the want of safety in the double fire-box boiler,
and states the various causes of boiler explosions. He then says : " I now propose to
show you the patent compound safety-valve, which is a prevention against explosions
from the causes before enumerated, and the explosions which have taken place from
all causes excepting that of a defective boiler, asunder all other circumstances steam

boiler explosions are rendered impossible."

   The patent compound safety-valve comprises two distinct valves, a large 5|- inch
diameter valve with flat face and a spherical or ball-faced valve 3 inches in diameter ;
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                           213

the smaller or ball valve sits upon the centre of the larger one. The larger valve is
weighted by means of a lever and ball, as in the common safety-valve ; there is an
iron bridge or cover casting, which fits to the large valve and forms the centre for the
centre pin to give pressure upon the valve enclosed : and resting upon the centre of
the large valve is the ball valve, which is weighted by a dead weight inside the boiler,

the dead weight being comprised of iron plate castings. When the steam exceeds the

pressure this ball-valve is weighted to, it escapes through the openings in the bridge

casting into the dome or shell and out into the atmosphere. As soon as the ball-valve
lifts from its seat, the large one also lifts from its seat ; and thus a double discharge is
given to the excessive steam. The feature here presented is of importance, inasmuch
as we find a valve possessing an opening or discharging area equal to an ordinary
safety-valve 8^V inches diameter. The valve cannot be weighted beyond its working
pressure whils't the boiler is at work, as it will be seen ; should an attempt be made
to weight the lever or even press upon it with all force, that would be useless so long
as the ball-valve was there ; and even should the ball- valve be weighted intentionally
whilst the boiler is standing for cleaning, &c., it may instantly be detected by placing
the ball on the lever in its ordinary wor'king place; and by getting up the steam you
will discover such tamperings and to what extent, by the marks on the lever. Yet

when the boiler is at work it defies any tamperings.
   With respect to its improved arrangement for deficiency of water,--there is

a lever suspended in the boiler ; the rod which bears the weight for the ball-

valve passes through a large hole in the centre of this lever. On this rod is fixed
a collar, which is arranged so as to allow the lugs of the lever to come in contact
with it as before mentioned. There is a lever or beam suspended in the boiler, one

end of which bears a large float, the opposite end a balance weight, to counteract the

buoyancy of the float when immersed in the water, and to keep the lip of the lever
up against the under side of the top of the boiler ; the float is immersed in the water

to such a depth as is called low water mark. When the water begins to leave the

float, the specific gravity of the float is then brought upon the end of the lever, which
turns upon a centre ; the lugs then are brought into contact with the collar on the

rod, and the \cdvc is raised from its seat.
    Should the water still get lower, the valve continues to rise, and will do so until

the water be again at its proper height : should the warning be disregarded, the steam

will all be discharged from the boiler and stop all working, and render explosion

impossible.

              On the Drainage of the Metropolis. By E. Jones.

   The author proposes to place portable tanks within cesspools constructed in the

Asewers, each capable of holding about one ton weight of solid sewage matter.

bar or grating to be fixed within the sewer, at one side of the tank, so constructed as
to act as a coarse filter to check the solids which will then be precipitated into the

tanks. The tanks when full to be lifted out by a portable crane, a lid being first

securely fixed thereon, so as to prevent the escape of the least smell. Previous to the
act of removal the communication with the sewers will be cut off, by doors or flood-

gates, made to slide in a grooved frame, by which the -water in the sewer will be
arrested and the effluvia prevented from escaping into the streets during the removal.
The author suggests that a series of these tanks be placed at a quarter of a mile
distant from each other within the sewers, and that thus the drains could beeffec-
tually scoured. He estimates that the cost would not exceed one and a half miUion :
also, that the Thames should be embanked ; within which embankment it is pro-
posed to construct, at the end of each main sewer, three reservoirs, to be divided into
compartments and fitted with moveable tanks to collect the sediment produced by
deodorizing with litne. Ornamental chimney shafts with furnaces to be constructed
near the mouths of the main sewers for the purpose of drawing off the noxious gases,
and also for the purpose of consuming refuse vegetable matter. The resulting ashes
may be used for deodorizing the sewage.

On the Application of Mechanical Power to the Bellows of Organs.

                             By D. Joy.

                                                                                                     ;

must be capable of perfect regulation down to an infinitesimally slow speed, and
without impairing its certainty of action at that slow speed. Hence it cannot depend
upon momentum to pass the dead points at the top and bottom of the stroke, as in a
steam engine ; and for simplicity it must only consist of one cylinder. It must also
be absolutely independent of attention or lubrication, and be always ready for use.

   The author, after detailing the results of a number of experiments, described an
engine which he illustrated with drawings. For some time the engine continued to
work perfectly ; but afterwards difficulty was experienced in lubricating the valve upon
its face, this requiring attention varying from once per month to once in three or
six months. Various metals were tried relatively for the valve and face ; but all after
a time squeezed out the lubricating material from between them, aud cut into each
other. Glass was tried with no better success. Lastly, a lignum vitte valve was
put in : this stood every test, and, though taking a little more power to drive when
originally put in, it was found to need no lubrication of any kind, the water acting

in the place of it.

  AThe peculiarities of the engine as it now stands are-- 1st. machine giving out a

reciprocating motion by the pressure of a non-elastic fluid, and capable of being re-

gulated to the lowest possible speed without the possibility of failing at the return

stroke, that return stroke depending upon a movement completed by the previous
stroke. 2nd. The adaptability of this machine to work under any pressure of the
afore-named non-elastic fluid, entirely free from the shocks usually attending such
machines from the necessity of suddenly changing the direction of the moving column,
which may be changed as slowly as requisite, by retarding the valve, or diminishing
the outlet. 3rd. The entire independence of attention or lubrication.

   The organ of the Leeds Town Hall is blown by five of these engines. They are

calculated to be able to supply 50 cubic feet of air per second, at a pressure equal to

a column of water of 6 inches, and when working at full speed to develope a power
equal to about 8 horses, as calculated by Watt's rule.

      On the Application of Combustible Compounds to be used in War.
                              By John Mackintosh.

   This paper relates to the use of coal-tar, naphtha, or other hydro-carbons, alone or iu
combination with other materials, to be used as an agent in attack and defence ; also
to the application of hydro-carbons mixed with gunpowder, and brought to a plastic
state by means of Indian rubber or other gums, and fibrous materials, introduced into
shells and other missiles ; also in filling shells with coal-tar, naphtha containing po-

tassium, for igniting when used in'water, and in filling shells with coal-tar, naphtha
mixed with phosphorus and bisulphuret of carbon, with bursting powder suflicient to

open the shells.

   To attack fortresses from seaward, the author would generate an artificial dense
and dark fog, capable of being prolonged at pleasure, in front of the batteries to be
attacked, which would render them untenable, enabling the attacking vessels to
approach and destroy the works unmolested by any hostile fire.

   The diaphragm shells filled with naphtha, phosphorus, aud bisulphuret of carbon,
may be used with great efl'ect against cavalry and troops, as the bursting of the shell

scatters the contents in all directions.

   When a shell containing the combustible material bursts in earthworks, the earth,

being porous and incombustible, prevents the combustion from spreading rapidly,
but allows the black vapour to ooze out graduallj', causing most serious annoyance

to the enemy, who are unable to extinguish the suffocating fog, and are hindered

from carrying on their operations.

   It may be brought to bear with most satisfactory results against an enemy en-

camped in tents.

                   On Constructing and Laying Telegraph Cables.

                              By John Mackintosh.

    In the ordinary process of expressing the gutta percha through dies in a fluid state,
the covered wire, as it issues from the die, is caused to pass into a long trough con-
taining water, for the purpose of setting it, but great difficulty is found in causing
the perfect union of the different coatings, which renders the insulation liable to
                               --

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                     215

 leakage. In order to obviate this difficult\', the wire is coated with gutta percha by
 means of rollers mounted on parallel axes, and revolving in contact with each other.
 Each of these rollers is grooved in its periphery, and these grooves meet to form an
 eye, the sizes of the covering desired. Against these rollers are placed hoppers, in
 which gutta ])ercha or Indian rubber is placed, in the state in which it comes from
 the masticator. This Indian rubber or gutta percha enters and fills up the grooves
 of the rollers; and where they come together, the gutta percha or India rubber in the
 grooves is brought together in one piece enclosing the conducting wire. The longi-
 tudinal strength and obtension are obtained by imbedding fibres of hemp, flax, or
 cotton in an outer layer of insulating material; this is done with great pressure.
 The covering is subsequently subjected to treatment which enables it to resist tropical
 heat, and affords quite sufficient protection against ill usage. The shore ends of the
 cable, or for shallow water, are protected with strong wire. In place of sulphuric
 acid, Mr. Mackintosh recommends the use of chloride of sulphur, mixed with a sol-

 vent by sulphuret of carbon. Add to this from 2 to 4 per cent, of chloride of sul-
 phur, and then pass the wjre through it. The speed at which the covered wire

 passes through the liquid is so regulated as to allow of its remaining therein for
 about three seconds, and this process closes up the pores thoroughly, and renders

the wire much less likely to be injured by heat or abrasion. The method of sub-
merging cables prepared by the author was to pass them through an apparatus con-
taining water and hard- wood balls, which would allow of the accomplishment of the

work without injuring the electrical condition of the ropes.

           On the Submersion of Electric Cables. By J. Maclean.

    The author proposes a plan stated to possess the following advantages :
    1. That any amount of slackable cable, from a few feet to several hundred feet,
might be obtained by adopting the plan proposed, so as to meet the pitching of the
vessel in a heavy sea, or any sudden stoppage in the paying- out machinery.
   2. By conducting a lever, upon which the spiral springs impinge, to the paying-
out machine, the rate at which the cable ought to be paid-out might be self-

regulated.

   3. Or this lever might have an indicator such as a dial-plate, by which the person

--who superintends the paying-out machine could see that a strain is upon the cable,

and that more is instantly wanted ; the slackable cable in the apparatus giving him

time to accelerate his machine, before the strain reaches a fixed point.

   4. The plan might be wrought nearly as well with the apparatus lying in a hori-

--zontal position, of course allowing the compensation weights to work perpen-

dicularly.

   5. The strain upon a cable, equal to one ton each mile, could never, under
ordinary circumstances, by the plan proposed, exceed 3000 lbs., which is only one
half of the strain caused by the pitching of the vessel during the late experiments in

the Bay of Biscay.
   G. By passing the cable under and over grooved wheels, an amount of friction

would be created, which might be an advantage rather than a disadvantage ; because,
in the late experiment, it was found that the cable ran too swiftly, and that it was

necessary to apply breaks. By adopting the plan described above, the increasing and
decreasing friction, according to the amount of strain, would act as a self-regulating

break.

   The author proposed to furnish the Association with such further information on

the performance of vessels at the measured mile as may induce them to appoint a

calculate from them the characteristics of vessels' engines and screw propellers, so

that the performance of each may be duly apportioned.

To this paper are appended Forms of Returns intended to further this object.

AWConsidering the formula R =        X z- to be the foundation of all sound induc-

tion on the question of resistances, the author considers also that at present its
limit of application is to the mid-section onl)', irrespective of hull, masts, and rig-
ging, and to the resistance in smooth water with calm weather.

   There are modifications of this equation to meet the increased resistance arising
from hull, masts and rigging, wind and sea, and the form of the vessel.

   Bui these modifications embrace only a very small range of the additional elements,
because no properly-conducted experiments have been made under varied conditions

at sea.

The resistances of sections which have come within the author's observation are

comprised within the expressions     ^ SV!

Now, the first observation that may be made is, that the larger diameter of course

produced a greater thrust, and so a better result. But this does not follow.

It will be observed that the pitch is considerably less in proportion to the diameter

in the new screw.

The slip was calculated beforehand, aad was given to Lord Staff'ord, a fortnight

before the trial, as about 171".

It will be seen that the mean average at the trials was ]7'9 per cent On the

same grounds, then, that he calculated the slip of the Undine, the author expressed

the opinion respecting the Rafiler.

The mean of trials in Yarmouth Roads, under favourable conditions, gives a slip

of 15'798 per cent, when the Rattler's draft of water was about 12 feet 4 inches,

Aher section 300 square feet, and speed 8 8 knots.     trial in the Thames, in October

1851, with a mean draft of IS-QJ inches, a section of 338 square feet, and a

speed of 9"l4l knots, gives a slip of 17'18 per cent.

The screw duly adjusted to the form of the Rattler would make a slip of about

12 per cent.

   The nature of the slip of the screw may be illustrated by the apparent effect upon
it when the vessel is moving in a tide-way.

Out of the seven trips made by the Undine, at the measured mile, the two greatest

--218 REPORT 1858.

   The mean rate of the tide, therefore, was about I'iG knot, the speed of the vessel
through the water about 8-78 knots, and the mean slip about 18-42 per cent. From
these data may be deduced the following relations, viz. :

    That the direct thrust of the screw against the tide is 6877 lbs., and the resultant
4429, and the slip, being the difference of the ratio of the square roots of these

quantities, is therefore 19'75 per cent.

   That the dii-ect thrust with the tide is 6498 lbs., and the resultant, as before, 4429 ;

the slip is 17*44 per cent.

   The mean slip is, consequently, 18'59, which is sufficiently near the former calcu-

lation of 18-42.

  A --further deduction is that the resultant, 4429 lbs., is at least equal to, or

greater than, the specific resistance ; for, if not, the slip would not have approached
so close to the theoretic ratio which, as before stated, was calculated before the

trial took place.

   This principle of the slip may be used to correct the speed of the Undine in her

run from Holyhead to the Mull of Cantire, when, with smooth water and light airs,
she had the tide with her the greater part of the time.

   The results were as under, viz. :

                                    9"24 per cent.

   Assuming the standard ratio of slip, as before determined, at about 18 per cen|;.,
the tide appears to have advanced the speed of the vessel about a mean rate of 0-87
of a knot per hour, and therefore reducing the speed through the water to 9'1 knots,
or 0-16 of a knot slower than at the measured mile, the indicator horse-power being

1*68 greater.

   The Undine was, it is believed, (Jeeper in the water on this last occasion.

 --The following questions arise for solution by means of ^he experiment^ which it is

my object to procure to be conducted at sea :

   In any given vessel, what relations obtain between the resistance due to ber sec-
tion in smooth water and calm weather, and the resistances the vessel herself
experiences under various conditions, when under sail, under the screw, and under

both?
   WJiat are the relations in any given engine of absorbed power at different speeds ?
   In any given screw, what are the relations between its length and its speed of

rotation, so that a coiitinuous disc shall be maintained ? and what immersion in rela-

tion to the diameter is necessary to this result ?

   What are the relations between the direct thrust of any given disc and its resultant,

and the consequent effective area and pitch and ratio of slip ?
   Researches of this nature, if carefully conducted, will show that the screw is

capable of more accurate application, and more extended use, than has yet been
made of it. Its slip is a calculable element, provided the periphery be so immersed,
and the rotation such that a continuous disc is maintained.

   The limits of immersion and rotation are yet to be determined.

On a new Double-acting Steam Hammer. By William Naylor, laic of

              Norwich, now of 3 New Broad Street, London, E. C.

   In considering the principle of the double-action steam hammer, we may draw

some analogy with the steam gun for throwing projectiles, and assume the cylinder
to be as the gun, and the piston and hammer attached as the ball. Let us assume

the cylinder as one foot in length, with the top cover off, and the relative force of

steam to the weight of the hammer such as by the time the piston reached the top
of the cylinder, and should be moving at a velocity of 32 feet per second, it would
ascend above the cylinder 16 feet, and when it had returned 16 feet by gravity it

would have acquired a velocity of 32 feet per second. Let us place the cover on the

cylinder, and lift up the hammer as before, only, instead of allowing it to rise up into

the atmosphere until its velocity and force were counteracted by gravity, let the steam

be entirely withdrawn from below the piston, and a supply introduced upon it.

That which has the power of putting it in motion has also the power of stopping it,

and of causing it to return with the same velocity, aided also by that which is due

to its gravity ; and it will be evident that, by the time it has reached the object it is

intended to strike, it must have acquired more than 32 feet per second, although the

Nowspace moved through is only one foot. So much for the effect of the blow.

Wefor time.  have assumed that, when the retarding force was employed upon the

piston, it was moving with a velocity that would have carried it 16 feet, and it was

returned with a still greater velocity by having the weight of the hammer with it

instead of against it ; so that the time must be considered as that which it would take

to rise one foot at such a velocity as would, if the motive power were withdrawn,

have sufficient momentum to carry or throw it 16 feet, and the time in returning

could not be more than the difference in time of a body falling 16 and 17 feet. The

double-acting steam hammer, working with such relative force and weight, would

give the same effect as the single-acting hammer of 16 feet range; but as to time,

there would be about 30 blows of the double-acting hammer to one of the single.

This hammer is also capable of giving very light blows as well as very heavy ones
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

               On a Piatt for giving Alarms in Passenger Trai?is.
                                 By J. O'Neill.

    This invention consists of an iron bar extending under each carriage, and suspended
on a pin a little from the centre, so as to make one end heavier than the other.

   The heavy end is securely held in a bridle, by a hanging latch at the end of the

carriage.

   The light end also passes through a bridle at the other end, and has a tongue
which draws out from the bar and reaches under the latch fixed on the next carriage.

   By disengaging any of the latches, the heavy end falls ; and the light end, in

rising, throws up the next latch, and so on to the guard's van, where it rings an
alarum.

  A chain or wire, fixed to the latch and brought into the carriage, gives each pas-

senger, in the event of danger, the means of giving a signal to the guard ; and a
duplicate set of bars, on the other side of the carriage, enables him instantly to com-
municate with the driver, if necessary.

   'ITie end of each tongue has a rising point, riveted loose ; so that the porter, when

coupling the carriages, could put it in position for disengaging the latch, in case the
carriages should become detached by the breaking of the coupling chains.

   As the bars are not connected, any number of carriages can be taken oft' or put
on at a station by merely turning the loose point on the end of the tongue up or
down.

On the Gresham Buoy, for recording the Loss of Missing Ships at Sea.

                    By James Oldham, C.E., Hull.

   The object of this paper is to point out a mode by which a record of the loss of
ships at sea may be attempted, where otherwise no account would ever be obtained.

It is proposed that ev.:y sea-going ship, of whatever description, and particularly

those carrying passengers, shall be provided with one or more copper buoys, bearing

the name of the vessel  and  the  port to which she belongs                                                                                                                       that they shall have an

in the upper part, made to open outwards, and capable of resisting any ordinary

pressure. Within this hollow space or chamber it is proposed to insert a slip of paper

or card, or any other document, and even propert)', if made large enough, when all

hope of  safety and  rescue shall  fail                  and  at  the final sinking or breaking up of  the
                                                      ;

ship the buoy would float off, with the probability of being picked up at some time.

The " Record Buoy" is intended to be made of strong copper, of sufficient size to

be applicable to the purpose, painted in bright-red and white stripes, and fitted with

a small bell and flag on the upper part.

Three important advantages are to be derived from the use of this buoy, viz. :

1st. The mournful satisfaction to surviving friends and relations, of being informed

of what has befallen the ship and crew ; 2ndly. Satisfaction to Insurance Companies
and insured, that the ship and cargo are really and for ever lost ; and 3rdly. The

light which may be thrown on science, as such records would probably explain the

--cause of accidents, and the circumstances attending them, for instance, whether

owing to the build and want of strength in a ship, failure of machinery (in case of

a steam vessel), or having struck on a rock, or otherwise.

               On the Construction of Floating and Fixed Batteries.

                              By G. Rennie.. F.R.S.

   The author observed, it was now some years since the covering of the exterior of

vessels of war with plates of iron was proposed by General Paixhans, of the French
Artillery. This he exposed in his work, and stated that, to enable a plate to resist a
32 lb. shot, it would require a thickness of several inches, and that from the great
weight of plates it was only applicable to ships of the line, and that at a cost of

^24,000. On the commencement of the late Russian war, the Emperor of the
French, who had paid much attention to the subject, brought it before our Govern-
ment. He considered that it would very much facilitate the operations then about

to take place against the Russian fortresses of Bomarsund, Helsingfors, Sweaborg,
and Cronstadt. Vessels of great burden and strength were therefore constructed
and covered with massive wrought-iron plates of four and five inches in thickness.
The results of the few trials which were made with these iron-plated batteries were
published in the journals of the day, but their success was considered to be doubtful.

Many experiments of solid and hollow shot, fired from G8-lb. guns, have been made

recently at Woolwich and Portsmouth, with unfavourable results. These results

led the author to think that little or no success had hitherto been attained. He

therefore proposed to use inclined or curved surfaces, instead of flat or point blank

surfaces, as was illustrated in the models exhibited. One of these was a floating

battery, or man-of-war, having its sides cased with iron plates with curved surfaces
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the other a fixed or floating battery, also with curved surfaces. He claimed no

other originality for this idea than in the curved forms of the plates. Mr. Rennie
also exhibited various specimens of felt which had been handed to him by General
Sir Charles Shaw, and several of which had been penetrated to a limited extent by

rifle balls.

            On a Universal Printing Press. By T. J. Silberman.

   In this paper the author describes a new method of printing by applying the
pressure of a fluid to a yielding surface, laid upon an unyielding engraved surface,

and this whether the surface printed be that of the vessel itself, which thus becomes
the press, or whether it be communicated to another interposed yielding surface

--from the pliable and elastic side of the vessel, so as to print plane, curved, or

 angular surfaces or whether the material to be printed be paper, felt, textile fabric,
 caoutchouc, leather, bladder, ceramic paste, or glass, crystal, or enamel, softened
 by heat ; or whether it be used for the purpose of peripheric printing, as in the
 printing of terrestrial and celestial globes, of vessels of glass or earthenware, or as a
 modification of the presses in use for other kinds of printing.

    The pressure, being that of a fluid communicated through a uniformly yielding

 surface, will be absolutely equal at every point of the surface ; consequently there
 will be no danger of partial pressure on the plate, nor need there be a pressure
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.              221

upon any part of the plate beyond merely what is necessary ; so that the maximum
result is obtainable with the minimum of pressure. Convex or concave surfaces can

be as easily printed as plane surfaces.

   The author describes very fully the different methods in use for the practical
application of the principle. One great advantage is its extremely simple construc-
tion, and the small space it occupies relatively to other jiresses ; moreover, a much
greater number of impressions can be taken in a given lime than was possible here-

tofore.

   As to the sort of pressure to be used ; steam, or expanded or condensed air, the
hydraulic press, the screw, the cam, or the eccentric or knee lever lock. If steam
is used, the waste heat will warm the plates in copperplate engraving, and will
thus get rid of the charcoal dust, which is so injurious to the health of the workmen.

   Water, on the whole, appears to be the most desirable agent on account of its
non-compressibility, and of the small quantity required in order to produce very
considerable pressure ; as also on account of its non-expansibility, which prevents
the possibility of an explosion ; for if any breakage takes place, the water simply

runs out.

   It was constructed for the purpose of being thrown overboard in case of wreck
or any other serious accident. Formed of copper in the shape of a ball, it consisted
of two hemispheiically-shaped shells, coupled together and water-tight, and in-
tended to contain the ship's log or other information or valuables. It was painted
in brilliant colours, and surmounted by a glass ball cut into facets at the top, so as

to shine in the rays of the sun.

                   Remarks on the Bursting of Guns and Cannon.

                              By S. Smith, F.R.C.S.

   About sixty years ago, the Government sent down to Leeds 1,500 heavy Prussian
muskets for the volunteers of that day : they were proved by the late Mr. Calvert,
in a place near School Close. He (Mr. Smith) was then a school lad, and he and

his fellow-scholars used to go and see the muskets proved, and they were sadly

disa|)pointed if some uf these old arms did not burst during the trial. When they
did burst, the barrels used to rise many feet, and describe many somersaults, and

then he and his fellow-scholars were delighted. From this fact, the conclusion

would naturally be come to, that where the gun burst at the breech, the force of

the explosion would be materially diminished, and the aim of the shot altered also.

His object was to prove that this theory was not correct. Fifty years ago, the

gardener of Mr. Elam of Sheepscar was brought into the Leeds Infirmary to have

--his arm taken off, and he told this story of his accident: He (the gardener) said he

was shooting small birds in the garden, and after firing the last time, he observed

he had killed two birds. He went to pick them up, and it was only on stooping
down to do so that he discovered that his hand was hanging down by two or three
tendons, and that the gun barrel had burst. He (Mr. Smith) made some observa-
tions about the accident. In the first place, it was singular that the man should
have his arm blown off, and not know it; and secondly, it struck him as being also

singular that the birds should be killed, although the gun had burst. Ten or twelve

years afterwards, when lie (Mr. S.) became surgeon at the infirmary, a man em-
ployed as watchman at Mr. Benyon's mill, in Meadow-lane, was brought in for
treatment. The man stated that he was coming off duty about five o'clock in the
morning, when he saw a crow at the top of a tree seventy yards off. He fired at it,

saw it drop, and found he had killed it, but the most singular part of the business
was that his gun had also burst, and evidently after the shot had left it. In 1855,
a cannon was fired at Woolwich, and the ball was seen to pass from the muzzle of
the gun, and to strike the butt. The gun afterwards screwed round, burst into
              ----

several fragments, and injured several men in the neighbourhood In this
latter case an appreciable amount of time elapsed between the ball leaving the
muzzle of the gun and the bursting of the gun at the breech. His theoiy conse-
quently was, that a ball discharged from a gun was not altered in its force and aim

by the bursting of the arm, but that the bursting occurred at a subsequent period

to the discharge of the ball. Mr. Smith has seen many other cases proving the
same fact.

             On Combined Steam. By the Hon. J. Weathered.

   Being convinced that ordinary steam was objectionable because it was too much
saturated with water, and that surcharged steam was also objectionable for an

exactly contrary reason, it being too dry, the author conceived the idea of com-
bining the two, and discovered in practice not only that the objections to both were

--removed, but that in combined steam a new power was produced an effective and

economical combination of fire and water, applicable to all purposes for which
steam is employed.

   In order to apply this new system, a pipe, in addition to the usual steam pipe
which conveys the ordinary steam away from the boiler, carrying with it more or

less water in a liquid state, is employed to convey part of the steam from the boiler
through pipes which are convoluted, or otherwise placed in any convenient form in
the uptalie or chimney of the boiler, and is joined to the ordinary steam pipe at or
near its entrance into the cylinder. In its passage through these pipes this steam
is more or less heated to a temperature of 500° or 600° Fahr. by the waste heat
which is passing up the chimney : this heat, thus arrested, is conveyed to and
utilized in the cylinder at temperatures varying between 300° and 400% instead of

at the low temperatures at which it is now employed.
   From various experiments which have been made by the British, French, and

United States Governments, all of which were attended with the most satisfactory
results, which are fully detailed in the paper, the author deduces the following

general inferences :

  --I. That the mixed steam participates at the same time of the qualities of steam

proper, and of gas, or superheated steam, the elasticity of the one, and the increased
temperature derived from the other.

   II. That saturated steam contains too much vesicular water, and that super-
heated steam has too much the nature of gas, is a bad conductor of heat, and gives

with difficulty the heat necessary to transform it into mechanical power.

   III. That, in all the experiments which have been made of the mixed steam, the
difference in the temperature of the steam in entering and leaving the cylinder was
greater than when saturated or surcharged steam alone was used ; consequently, as
more heat was utilized, greater mechanical force was generated.

    IV. It seems evident, therefore, that the mixture contains more latent caloric,
which is rendered sensible, and consequently converted into mechanical power.

   The advantages which it possesses over the use of ordinary steam are :
    1st. One-third of the wear and tear of boilers prevented, inasmuch as only two-

thirds of the usual quantity of heat is required ; and, as only two-thirds of the
usual quantity of water is needed, one-third of the deposit in boilers is prevented.

    2nd. For the same speed smaller boilers can be used.
    3rd. Increased power when required in cases of emergencj'.
    4th. Priming effectually prevented.
    5th, Less danger from explosion, as the increased power is exerted in the cylinder,
and not in the boiler.

    6th. The system can be employed to any boiler now in use.
    7th. One-third of the space now occupied by coal can be used for freight, or
steamers may go one-third farther with the same coal.

    8th. Fewer strokes are required.
    9th. The desired pressure readily maintained at all times.

  On Recent Improvements in Railway Signals. By C. F, Whitworth.

    The recent improvements in railway signals, known as Whitworth and Gibson's

 combined patent, consist of the following provisions :
    1st. Tlie improved releaser for auxiliary or distant signals, which operates to

protect stations, junctions, opening bridges, and other paits where men are posted

 in constant charge.
    2nd. Continuous signals, adapted for the protection of intermediate places

between distant stations, and especially where there are tunnels or curved cuttings

 or inclines.

    3rd. Announcing bells, which may be only mechanical or operated upon

magnetically, acting either in advance or in rear of the train, so as to indicate,

as may be required, the position of trains in progress.
    4th. The air vessel or cushion, to regulate the motion of the signal under an

excess of weight advisable to ensure the due action of the danger signal.

    5th. The compensation, which acts as a perpetual adjusting screw on the

wires ; so that, whatever the temperature, the tension will always be equal.
    Gth. The engine fog signal, which is so arranged as to operate under the plat-

form of the engine whenever a signal, at danger, is unobserved, either through

carelessness or impenetrable mists.

   The peculiarities of these inventions are, that the motion of the signal is totally

irrespective of the velocity or impetus of the train effecting it ; also that the first
wheel which passes the signal-post acts on the lever completely, and so depresses
the lever in contact as to prevent its rising against any subsequent wheel in the

train.

   The author then described by the aid of diagrams and models these various im-
provements, and also illustrated in addition a method of signaling by telegraph,
which could be attached to the previously-described machinery, when required,
when the same depression of the lever before referred to in connexion with the
first signal-post brings into contact a small lever and stud, thereby completing the
electric current, and acting upon an electro-magnetic bell placed in any suitable
situation in advance or in rear of the moving train,--the bell ringing continuously
until the second signal apparatus be reached, when the second lever breaks the
current simultaneously with releasing the first signal and setting the second to
