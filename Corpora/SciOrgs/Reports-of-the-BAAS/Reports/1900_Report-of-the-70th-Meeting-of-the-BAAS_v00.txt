                      REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

Report of the Council for the year 1899-1900, presented to the General
         Coinviittee at Bradford on Wednesday, September 5, 1900.

     The Council have nominated Dr. N. Bodington, Vice-Chancellor of
the Victoria University, and Professor L. C. Miall, F.R.S., Vice-Presidents
for the meeting at Bradford.

     The Council have nominated Professor Weldon, F.R.S., to be a
Governor of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom in
place of the late Sir William Flower.

     The Council having been informed by Professor Schafer that he does

not intend to offer himself for re-election as General Secretary after the
meeting at Bradford, desire to record their sense of the valuable services
which he has rendered to the Association.

     The Council recommend that Dr. D. H. Scott, F.R.S., be appointed

General Secretary in succession to Professor Schafer.

     The following resolutions, referred to the Council by the General
Committee, have been considered and acted upon :

     (1) That in view of the opportunities of ethnographical inquiry which will be

presented by the Indian Census, the Council of the Association be requested to

urge the Government of India to make use of the Census Officers for the purposes
enumerated below, and to place photographers at the service of the Census

Officers.

     1. To establish a survey of the jungle races, Bhils, Gonds, and other tribes of
the central mountain districts.

    2. To establish a further survey of the Naga, Kuki, and other cognate races
of the Assam and Burmese frontiers.

    3. To collect further information about the vagtant and criminal tribes
Haburas, Beriyas, Sansij'as, &c., in North and Central India.

     4. To collect physical measurements, particularly of the various Dravidian

tribes, in order to determine their origin ; and of the Rajputs and Jats of Raj-
putana and the Eastern Panjab, to determine their relation with the Yu-echi and
other Indo-Scjthian races.

5. To furnish a series of photographs of typical specimens of ' he various races

of views of archaic industries                                                                                                                                   and of other facts interesting to ethnologists.
                                                                                                                                                              ;

     The Council appointed a Committee, consisting of Mr. H. Balfour, Mr.
F. Galton, Professor A. C. Haddon, Mr. C. H. Read, and the General
Officers, to report on this matter.

     In accordance with the recommendation of the Committee, the Council
requested the President to address the following letter to the Secretary of
State for India :

At the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of

Science at Dover, attention was called to the special opportunity offered

by the Census about to be taken in India for collecting valuable ethno-

graphical data concerning the races                                                                                                                              of  the country                                          and  the Council of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

the Association having taken the matter into consideration, and bein"»

Ixxxii  REPORT-- 1900.

impressed by its scientific importance, have requested me, On their behalf,
to bring to the notice of Her Majesty's Government the valuable scientific
results which might be obtained by means of the Census.

     The results of the Census itself constitute, of course, by their very

nature, an ethnographical document of great value ; and my Council feel

that, without overburdening the Officers of the Census or incurring any very
lar^e expense, that value might be increased to a very remarkable degree
if to the enumeration were added the collection of some easily ascertained
ethnographical data. They are encouraged to make this suggestion by
the reflection that the Census Commissioner is an accomplished ethno-

graphist, well known by his publication on the Tribes and Castes of
Bengal, the valuable results of which would be supplemented by the
inquiries now proposed. They feel confident that, with his aid and under
his direction, most important data may be obtained at a minimum of

effort and cost. I may add that should the suggestion which my Council

desire to make be carried out, a great step will have been taken towards
establishing a uniform method of ethnographical observation in India--

matter of great scientific importance.

    Stated briefly, what, my Council desire to see carried out is as

follows :

      1. While collecting the oi'dinary information for the Census, to
investigate the physical and sociological characters of the various races
and tribes of India. Such data would furnish the basis for a true
estima,tion of the number and distribution of the tribes in question, and
thus powerfully contribute to a sound classification of the races of India.

      Special attention to be directed («) to the jungle races^Bhils, Gonds,

--and other tribes of the central mountain districts concerning which our

information is at present very limited.

     (h) To the Naga, Kuki, and other cognate races of the Assam and

--Burmese frontiers, and of the vagrant and criminal tribes Haburas,
--Beriyas, Sansiyas, &c. in North and Central India.

     (c) To the Dravidian tribes, and the Rajputs and Jats of Rajputana
and the Eastern Panjab. This will be of service in throwing light on
the important and difficult problem of the origin of these tribes and their
 relation with the Yu-echi and other Scythian races.

      (d) To pay especial attention to the question of a possible Negrito

 element in certain ethnic groups in India.

      2. To obtain, so far as can be done without too great labour and

 expense, a series of photographs of typical individuals of the various

 races, and, if it should be practicable, of views of archaic industries, &c.

 This, which might be accomplished by placing photographers at the
 service of the Census Officers, would be the commencement of an

 Ethnographical Survey of India similar to, and certainly no less important

 than, the Archteological Survey of which the Government of India may so

justly be proud.

     My Council, in considering the above proposal, have been assisted by

 a Committee of gentlemen possessing special knowledge of the subject in

 question, and I am to add that this Committee will be pleased to place
 themselves at the disposal of Her Majesty's Government to assist in the
 proposed investigation. If it should seem desirable to Her Majesty's

 Government, the Committee are pre ared to put themselves into direct

REPOET OP THE COUNCIL.  Ixxxiii

communication with the Officers of the Census, who, however, the Council
have reason to believe, are fully capable of carrying out the details of the

investigations proposed.

     The Secretary of State for India has forwarded a copy of this letter to
the Government of India for consideration.

           (2) That the Council be requested to represent to Her Majesty's Government
       the importance of giving more prominence to Botany in the training of Indian

        Forest OflBcers,

   A Committee consisting of Sir W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, Sir George King,

Professor Marshall Ward, and the General Officers, was appointed to
report on this matter.

    As a result of their deliberations the following letter was addressed by

the President to the Secretary of State for India :

     The Council of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
having had under consideration the remarks made by Sir George King at
the meeting in Dover in September last, as to the deficiency in botanical
knowledge of the officers in the Forest Department of India, think that
the subject is one of such great importance as to justify them in bringing
the conclusions at which they have arrived before the Secretary of State for

India.

     The Forest Department in India not only has charge of the great
forests of that Empire, but is frequently called upon to supply trained

officers for the care of those of our colonial possessions. It is needless

to insist that those who practise the art of forestry ought to have a firm
grasp of the scientific principles on which the art is based. They should

be able to do more than, as a matter of routine, follow out conscientiously
the rules laid down for them ; they ought to possess the scientific knowledge

which will enable them to seize opportunities which may present themselves

of extending the resources and developing the economic value of our
forests, and which will give them power over unforeseen difficulties
occasioned by plant diseases or other causes.

     There seems, however, to be little doubt, from evidence which has
been laid before a Committee of this Council, that, with some exceptions,
the forest officers on actual duty have at most a very slender equipment of

botanical knowledge. It appears that they are in many cases unable to make

intelligent use, or, indeed, in individual cases, any use at all, of the excellent
technical works provided for their use at the expense of India by the
Secretary of State. The majority of them are unable to give scientific
precision to their reports, or to demonstrate the contents of the forests under

their charge to foreign experts. Indeed, probably it may be said with truth
that the native subordinate officers trained in India at Dehra Dun possess

a more accurate knowledge of Indian botany than do the European

officers under whom they have to serve.

   My Council desire to urge upon the Secretary of State for India that

--this undesirable state of things undesirable for many reasons, among

others that through it the capabilities of our forests are probably not as

--fully developed as they might be, to the detriment of Indian revenues

may be traced in part at least to the circumstances under which the forest

officers are selected.

     The mode of selection adopted ought to be such that the Indian
Forest Service should draw into its ranks men whose aptitudes and tastes

                                                                                             e2
Ixxxiv  --heport 1900,

fit them for their future duties. The work of a forest officer calls espe^
cially for those powers of observation and inference which natural-history
studies are peculiarly fitted to encourage. Young men with an aptitude
for such studies would seem to be material which the Secretary of State

"vould naturally desire to secure for filling the ofiices in question.

     But the mode of selection at present in use, so far from favouring, is

distinctly antagonistic to such an end.
      In the first place, the present age- limit of twenty is exercising an

unfavourable influence, since it prevents the entrance into the service of

men who have had a university training. Training in natural-history

 studies is, at present at least, very imperfectly carried out in our Public
 Schools, even in the best of them ; it is to our Universities and not to our

Schools that we must look for young men trained in these studies ; and
such men are excluded by the present age-limit. It may be worth while

 to point out here that some of the ablest Indian forest officers in the past

 have been men of university training who entered the service at a time
 when the age-limit was very difierent from what it is now.

      In the second place, the examination, by means of which candidates

 are selected, does not tend to the selection of men of natural-history, or

 even of scientific, aptitude.

      The examination in question is the same as that for the Indian Police

 Department, with the exception that German is compulsory. My Council

 believe that the Secretary of State for India will agree with them

 in thinking that a system of examination, which may be the best

 for the selection of officers of the Police Depai'tment, whose duties are

 simply administrative, cannot be expected to be the best for the selection of

 officers of the Forest Department, whose duties should be distinctly scientific.

 They therefore submit respectfully, but most earnestly, to the Secretary of

 State, the desirability of making some marked changes in the method of

  selection of candidates for the forest service in India.

       They would wish in the first place to suggest to him whether it would

  not be possible to recruit the service, in part at least, directly from the

  Universities, by placing some of the vacancies at the disposal of young

 men who, by their university career, had given evidence of their aptitude

  for natural-history studies and work, and a promise of success in the

  application of such studies to forestry. In any case, they would urge the

 importance of so extending the age-limit as not to exclude men who have

  had a university training.

      And they may here state that they understand that the candidates,

  who are selected from passed Students of the " Institut Agronomique "

  and the " Ecole Polytechnique " for admission to the French Forest school
  at Nancy, must have acquired the university degree of Bachelier es

   Sciences.

        In the second place, they desire to urge the importance of so modifying
  the nature of the entrance examination as to specially adapt it to securing

   efficient forest officers.

       The forest officer needs, in addition to other general qualifications, a

  kno.vledge of botany and an aptitude for natural-history studies. No

  proper grasp of botanical science can be gained without an adequate

  elementary knowledge of physics and chemistry. And the examination
  which would seem best calculated to select the fittest men for the forest

  service would be one in which prominence was given to botany, and to
  physics and chemistry as introductory to that science, with an adequate
                        REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  IXXXV

number of marks assigned to other natural-history studies, such as geology

and zoology.

    If the relatively enormous value now attached to German is connected
with the sending of candidates to Germany for their professional educa-

tion, it must be noted that at the present day, in regard both to methods

of instruction and even, to a large extent, to forest practice, France is

considered by many competent judges to afford opportunities for training

as good as, or possibly better than, those offered by Germany. And

French ought to occupy, from this point of view, the same position as

German.

In any case, what is needed by the candidate, whether he goes to

Germany or to France for part of his training, is not an academic know-

ledge of the language but a colloquial one, such as will enable him to profit

at once by a stay in the country. For the purposes of study, a know-

ledge of one or other tongue, though advantageous, is not necessary, since

excellent and sufficient treatises and text-books are now to be found in

the English language. This is shown by what my Council are told is

the case, that in the French forest service examination English is now

optional with Gei'man.

It may be added that if the candidates selected already possessed an

adequate general acquaintance with botany and the allied sciences, there

would be no need to teach these introductory and preliminary sciences at

Coopers Hill. The teaching there might be limited to technical Indian

botany, to forest surveying and engineering, and to the theory and

practice of Forestry itself. "Were this done, the stay at Coopers Hill

might possibly be shortened to two years, instead of three, as at present.

myIn conclusion,        Council desire to state that in their opinion it is by

changes in the method of selection of candidates rather than by changes

in the training at Coopers Hill that amendment may be secured. They

are convinced that unless some change is made in the preliminaiy selection

of candidates, the institution at Coopers Hill cannot be expected to

produce the kind of forest officers so greatly needed for the welfare of our

great Indian empire. Were, however, changes made in the mode of

selection, the acknowledged usefulness of Coopers Hill might be still

further increased.

     In the reply to this letter, dated February "27, the President was informed
that the attention of the Secretary of State was drawn last autumn to the
remarks in Sir George King's address at the Dover meeting, and that he

has asked Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer and Sir Dietrich Brandis to be good

enough to look into the matter, and to advise him in what way the
Botanical teaching at Coopers Hill College can be improved and rendered
more practical. The report of these authorities will be forwarded with
the President's letter, for the consideration of the Government of India,
and for such observations and suggestions as they may have to make, with

a view to practical measures of reform.

            (3) That the attention of the Council be called to the wording of the rule
      regarding specimens collected by Committees appointed by the Association,
       with a view to its revision.

     The Council recommended that in the Rule referred to, viz., ' Members
and Committees who may be entrusted with sums of money for collecting

specimens of Natural History, are requested to reserve the specimens so

obtained to be dealt with by authority of this Association,' the words
' any description ' be substituted for ' Natural History,' and 'the Council'

for ' this Association.'

            (4) That the complete investigation of the Ichthyology of the West African
      rivers promises extremely important scientific results, and that the Council of
      the Association be requested to take such means as may seem to it advisable to
       bring the matter to the notice of the Trustees of the British Museum.

   A Committee, consisting of Prof. Herdman, Prof. A. Newton, Mr.

A. E. Shipley, Prof. Weldon, and the General Officers, was appointed to
report on this matter.

      In accordance with the recommendation of this Committee, the
President, with the approval of the Council, addressed a letter to the

Trustees of the British Museum explaining that the matter had been
brought under the notice of the Council through an application made on
behalf of Mr. Boulenger, of the British Museum, for a grant to assist a
collector in obtaining fishes from the West African rivers, which applica-

tion the Association had declined to accede to, not from any want of
appreciation of the importance of the researches, but from the difficulties
attachiiig to applications made to the British Association for grants in
aid of researches undertaken by members of the Staff of the Natural

History Museum as part of their official duties.

     In reply the Director of the Natural History Departments pointed out
that the application had not been made on behalf, or with the knowledge,
of the Trustees, and that it was not for any work which formed part of
his official duties. The small sum of money required by Mr. Boulenger for

this particular occasion had, since his application to the British Association,

been arranged for by the authorities of the Museum in the usual way.

year, together with the list of the Corresponding Societies and the titles

of the more important papers, and especially those referring to Local

Scientific Investigations, published by those Societies during the year
ending June 1, 1900, has been received.

Twenty-seven years ago the British Association met in Bradford, not at
that time raised to the dignity of a City. The meeting was very success-

--ful, and was attended by nearly 2,000 persons a forecast, let us hope,

of what we may expect at the present assembly. An eminent chemist.
Professor A. W. "Williamson, presided. On this occasion the Associa-

tion has selected for the presidential chair one whose attention has
been given to the study of an important department of biological science.
His claim to occupy, however unworthily, the distinguished position in
which he has been placed, rests, doubtless, on the fact that, in the midst
of the engrossing duties devolving on a teacher in a great University

and School of Medicine, he has endeavoured to contribute to the sum

of knowledge of the science which he professes. It is a matter of satis-
faction to feel that the success of a meeting of this kind does not rest upon
the shoulders of the occupant of the presidential chair, but is due to the

eminence and active co-operation of the men of science who either pre-
side over or engage in the work of the nine or ten sections into which the

Association is divided, and to the energy and ability for organisation
displayed by the local Secretaries and Committees. The programme pre-
pared by the general and local officers of the Association shows that nc
efforts have been spared to provide an ample bill of fare, both in its
scientific and social aspects. Members and Associates will, I feel sure,
take away from the Bradford Meeting as pleasant memories as did our
colleagues of the corresponding Association Frangaise, when, in friendly

collaboration at Dover last year, they testified to the common citizenship
of the Universal Republic of Science. As befits a leading centre of

industry in the great county of York, the applications of science to the
industrial arts and to agriculture will form subjects of discussion in the
papers to be read at the meeting.
--4 REPORT 1000.

     Since the Association was at Dover a year ago, two of its former
Presidents have joined the majority. The Duke of Argyll presided at the
meeting in Glasgow so far back as 1855. Throughout his long and energetic

life, he proved himself to be an eloquent and earnest speaker, one who gave
to the consideration of public affairs a mind of singular independence, and

a thinker and writer in a wide range of human knowledge. Sir J. Wm.

Dawson was President at the meeting in Birmingham in 1886. Born
in Nova Scotia in 1820, he devoted himself to the study of the Geology

of Canada, and became the leading authority on the subject. He took

also an active and influential part in promoting the spread of scientific
education in the Dominion, and for a number of years he was Principal
and Vice-Chancellor of the M'Gill University, Montreal.

                                                Scientific Method.

     Edward Gibbon has told us that diligence and accuracy are the only
merits which an historical writer can ascribe to himself. Without doubt

they are fundamental qualities necessary for historical research, but in
order to bear fruit they require to be exercised by one whose mental
qualities are such as to enable him to analyse the data brought together
by his diligence, to discriminate between the false and the true, to

possess an insight into the complex motives that determine human action,

to be able to recognise those facts and incidents which had exercised either
a primary or only a secondary influence on the aflfairs of nations, or on
the thoughts and doings of the person whose character he is depicting.

     In scientific research, also, diligence and accuracy are fundamental

qualities. By their application new facts are discovered and tabulated,

their order of succession is ascertained, and a wider and more intimate
knowledge of the processes of nature is acquired. But to decide on their
true significance a well-balanced mind and the exercise of prolonged
thought and reflection are needed. "William Harvey, the father of exact
research in physiology, in his memorable work \De Motu Cordis et San-
guinis,' published more than two centuries ago, tells us of the great and
daily diligence which he exercised in the course of his investigations, and

the numerous observations and experiments which he collated. At the

same time he refers repeatedly to his cogitations and reflections on the
meaning of what he had observed, without which the complicated move-
ments of the heart could not have been analysed, their significance deter-
mined, and the circulation of the blood in a continuous stream definitely
established. Early in the present century, Carl Ernst von Baer, the
father of embryological research, showed the importance which he attached
to the combination of observation with meditation by placing side by side
on the title-page of his famous treatise ' Ueber Entwickelungsgeschichte

der Thiere ' (1828) the words Beobachtung und Reflexion.

     Though I have drawn from biological science my illustrations of the

 nfeed of this combinationj it must ndt be inferred that it applies exclu-

sively to one branch of scientific inquiry ; the conjunction influences and

determines progress in all the sciences, and when associated with a
sufficient touch of imagination, when the power of seeing is conjoined with
the faculty of foreseeing, of projecting the mind into the future, we may
expect something more than the discovery of isolated facts ; their co-
ordination and the enunciation of new principles and laws will necessarily

follow.

     Scientific method consists, therefore, in close observation, frequently

repeated so as to eliminate the possibility of erroneous seeing ; in experi-

ments checked and controlled in every direction in which fallacies might
arise ; in continuous reflection on the appearances and phenomena
observed, and in logically reasoning out their meaning and the conclusions

to be drawn from them. Were the method followed out in its integrity
by all who are engaged in scientific investigations, the time and labour

expended in correcting errors committed by ourselves or by other
observers and experimentalists would be saved, and the volumes devoted
annually to scientific literature would be materially diminished in size.

Were it applied, as far as the conditions of life admit, to the conduct and
management of human affairs, we should not require to be told, when
critical periods in our welfare as a nation arise, that we shall muddle

through somehow. Recent experience has taught us that wise discretion
and careful prevision are as necessary in the direction of public affairs as

in the pursuit of science, and in both instances, when properly exercised,
they enable us to reach with comparative certainty the goal which we

strive to attain.

                         Improvements in Means of Observation.

     Whilst certain principles of research are common to all the sciences,

each great division requires for its investigation specialised arrangements

to insure its progress. Nothing contributes so much to the advancement
of knowledge as improvements in the means of observation, either by the
discovery of new adjuncts to research, or by a fresh adaptation of old
methods. In the industrial arts, the introduction of a new kind of raw
material, the recognition that a mixture or blending is often more
serviceable than when the substances employed are uncombined, the
discovery of new pi-ocesses of treating the articles used in manufactures,

the invention of improved machinery, all lead to the expansion of trade,
to the occupation of the people, and to the development of great
industrial centres. In science, also, the invention and employment of

new and more precise instruments and appliances enable us to appreciate
more clearly the signification of facts and phenomena which were pre-
viously obscure, and to penetrate more deeply into the mysteries of nature.
They mark fresh departures in the history of science, and provide a firm
base of support from which a continuous advance may be made and fresh

conceptions of nature can be evolved
--6 REPORT 1900.

    It is not my intention, even if I possessed the requisite knowledge,

to undertake so arduous a task as to review the progress which has recently
been made in the great body of sciences which lie within the domain of

the British Association. As my occupation in life has required me to

give attention to the science which deals with the structure and organisa-

--tion of the bodies of man and animals a science which either includes

within its scope or has intimate and widespread relations to comparative
anatomy, embryology, morphology, zoology, physiology, and anthropology

-- I shall limit myself to the attempt to bring before you some of the more

important observations and conclusions which have a bearing on the

present position of the subject. As this is the closing year of the century,

it will not, I think, be out of place to refer to the changes which a

hundred years have brought about in our fundamental conceptions of the

structure of animals. In science, as in business, it is well from time to

time to take stock of what we have been doing, so that we may realise
where we stand and ascertain the balance to our credit in the scientific

ledger.

    So far back as the time of the ancient Greeks it was known that the
human body and those of the more highly organised animals were not homo-

geneous, but were built up of parts, the partes dissimilares (ra ayofiom ^eprj)
of Aristotle, which difiered from each other in form, colour, texture,

consistency, and properties. These parts were familiarly known as the
bones, muscles, sinews, blood-vessels, glands, brain, nerves, and so on.
As the centuries rolled on, and as observers and observations multiplied,
a more and more precise knowledge of these parts throughout the Animal
Kingdom was obtained, and various attempts were made to classify

animals in accordance with their forms and structure. During the
concluding years of the last century and the earlier part of the present,
the Hunters, William and John, in our country, the Meckels in Germany,
Cuvier and Saint-Hilaire in France, gave an enormous impetus to anatomical
studies, and contributed largely to our knowledge of the construction of the
bodies of animals. But whilst by these and other observers the most

salient and, if I may use the expression, the grosser characters of animal
organisation had been recognised, little was known of the more intimate

structure or texture of the parts. So far as could be determined by the
unassisted vision, and so much as could be recognised by the use of a

simple lens, had indeed been ascertained, and it was known that muscles,

nerves, and tendons were composed of threads or fibres, that the blood-

and lymph-vessels were tubes, that the parts which we call fasciae and

aponeui'oses were thin membranes, and so on.
     Early in the present century Xavier Bichat, one of the most brilliant

men of science during the Napoleonic era in France, pubUshed his

' Anatomie Gi^n^rale,' in which he formulated important general principles.
Every animal is an assemblage of different organs, each of which dis-

charges a function, and acting together, each in its own way, assists in the
                   ADDRESS.                                           7

preservation of the whole. The organs are, as it were, special machines
situated in the general building which constitutes the factory or body

of the individual. But, further, each organ or special machine is itself
formed of tissues which possess different properties. Some, as the blood-

vessels, nerves, fibrous tissues, &c., are generally distributed throughout

the animal body, whilst others, as bones, muscles, cartilage, tfcc, are found
only in certain definite localities. Whilst Bichat had acquired a definite
philosophical conception of the general principles of construction and of
the distribution of the tissues, neither he nor his pupil Beclard was in a

position to determine the essential nature of the structural elements.

The means and appliances at their disposal and at that of other ob-

servers in their generation were not sufficiently potent to complete the

analysis.

Attempts were made in the third decennium of this century to improve

the methods of examining minute objects by the manufacture of com-
pound lenses, and, by doing away with chromatic ;ind spherical aberra-

tion, to obtain, in addition to magnification of the object, a relatively large

Whenflat field of vision with clearness and sharpness of definition.  in

January 1830 Joseph Jackson Lister read to the Royal Society his

memoir ' On some properties in achromatic object-glasses applicable to

the improvement of microscopes,' he announced the principles on which
combinations of lenses could be arranged, which would possess these

qualities. By the skill of our opticians, microscopes have now for more

than half a century been constructed which, in the hands of competent

observers, have influenced and extended biological science with results

comparable to those obtained by the astronomer through improvements

in the telescope.

Tn the study of the minute .structui'e of plants and animals the observer

has frequently to deal with tissues and organs, most of which possess such
softness and delicacy of substance and outline that, even when micro-

scopes of the best construction are employed, the determination of the

intimate nature of the tissue, and the precise relation which one element

of an organ bears to the other constituent elements, is in many instances
a matter of difficulty. Hence additional methods have had to be devised

in order to facilitate study and to give precision and accuracy to our

observations. It is difficult for one of the younger generation of biologists,

with all the appliances of a well-equipped laboratory at his command,
with experienced teachers to direct him in his work, and with excellent
text-books, in which the modern methods are described, to realise the

conditions under which his predecessors worked half a century ago.

Laboratories for minute biological research had not been constructed,

the practical teaching of histology and embryology had not been organised,

experience in methods of v/ork had not accumulated ; each man was left
to his individual efforts, and had to puzzle his way through the complica-

tions of structure to the best of his power. Staining and hardening
8 REPORT--1900.

reagents were unknown. The' double-bladed knife invented by Valentin,
held in the hand, was the only improvement on the scalpel or razor for
cutting thin, more or less translucent slices suitable for microscopic
examination ; mechanical section-cutters and freezing arrangements had
not been devised. The tools at the disposal of the microscopist were
little more than knife, forceps, scissors, needles ; with acetic acid, glyce-
rine, and Canada balsam as reagents. But in the employment of the
newer methods of research care has to be taken, more especially when
hardening and staining reagents are used, to discriminate between
appearances which are to be intei'preted as indicating natural characters,
and those which are only artificial productions.

     Notwithstanding the difficulties attendant on the study of the more
delicate tissues, tlie compound achromatic microscope provided anatomists
with an instrument of great penetrative power. Between the yeai'S 1830
and 1850 a number of acute observei's applied themselves with much energy
and enthusiasm to the examination of the minute structure of the tissues
and organs in plants and animals.

           Cell Theory.

It had, indeed, long been recognised that the tissues of plants were

to a large extent composed of minute vesicular bodies, technically called

cells (Hooke, Malpighi, Grew). In 1831 the discovery was made by the

great botanist, Robert Brown, that in many families of plants a circular

spot, whicli he named areola or nucleus, was present in each cell ; and in
1838 M. J. Schleiden published the fact that a similar spot or nucleus was

a universal elementary organ in vegetables. In the tissues of animals also

structures had begun to be recognised comparable with the cells and nuclei

of the vegetable tissues, and in 1839 Theodore Schwann announced the

important generalisation that there is one universal principle of develop-

ment for the elementary part of organisms, however difierent they may be in

appearance, and that this principle is the formation of cells. The enun-

ciation of the fundamental principle that the elementary tissues consisted

of cells constituted a step in the progress of biological science, which

will for ever stamp the century now drawing to a close with a character
and renown equalling those which it has derived from the most brilliant

discoveries in the physical sciences. It pro\ided biologists with the

visible anatomical units through which the external forces operating on,

and the energy generated in, living matter come into play. It dispelled

for ever the old mystical idea of the influence exercised by vapours or

spirits in living organisms. It supplied the physiologist and pathologist

with the specific structures through the agency of which the functions of

organisms are discharged in health and disease. It exerted an enormous

Ainfluence on the progress of practical medicine.  review of the progress

of knowledge of the cell may appropriately enter into an address on this

occasion.

                 Structure of Cells.

A cell is a living particle, so minute that it needs a microscope for its

examination ; it qroM-s in size, maintains itself in a state of activity,
responds to the action of stimuli, reproduces its kind, and in the course
of time it degenerates and dies.

      Let us glance at the structure of a cell to determine its constituent
parts and the role which each plays in the function to be discharged.

The original conception of a cell, based upon the study of the vegetable
tissues, was a minute vesicle enclosed by a definite wall, which exer-

cised chemical or metabolic changes on the surrounding matei'ial and

Asecreted into the vesicle its characteristic contents.  similar conception

was at first also entertained regarding the cells of animal tissues ; but as
observations multiplied, it was seen that numerous elementary particles,

which were obviously in their nature cells, did not possess an enclosing

Aenvelope.  wall ceased to have a primary value as a constituent part of

a cell, the necessary vesicular character of which therefore could no longer

be entertained.

The other constituent parts of a cell are the cell plasm, which forms

the body of the cell, and the nucleus embedded in its ^bstance. Not-

withstanding the very minute size of the nucleus, which even in the
lai'gest cells is not more than - J^yth inch in diameter, and usually is

considerably smaller, its almost constant form, its well-defined sharp

outline, and its power of resisting the action of strong reagents when
applied to the cell, have from the period of its discovery by Robert Brown
caused histologists to bestow on it much attention. Its structure and
chemical composition ; its mode of origin ; the part which it plays in the
formation of new cells, and its function in nutrition and secretion have

been investigated.

    When examined under favourable conditions in its passive or resting

state, the nucleus is seen to be bounded by a membrane which separates

it from the cell plasm and gives it the characteristic sharp contour.

It contains an apparently structureless nuclear substance, nucleoplasm or
enchylema, in which are embedded one or more extremely minute particles

called nucleoli, along with a network of exceedingly fine threads or fibres,
which in the active living cell play an essential part in the production

of new nuclei within the cell. In its chemical composition the nuclear
substance consists of albuminous plastin and globulin ; and of a special
material named nuclein, rich in phosphorus and with an acid reaction.
The delicate network within the nucleus consists apparently of the nuclein,

a substance which stains with carmine and other dyes, a property which
enables the changes, which take place in the network in the production of
young cells, to be more readily seen and followed out by the observer.

     The mode of origin of the nucleus and the part which it plays in
the production of new cells have been the subject of much discussion.
10 KEPORT-- 1900.

Schleiden, whose observations, published in 1838, were made on the cells
of plants, believed that within the cell a nucleolus first appeared, and that
around it molecules aggregated to form the nucleus. Schwann again,
whose observations were mostly made on the cells of animals, considered
that an amorphous material existed in organised bodies, which he called

oytoblastema. It formed the contents of cells, or it might be situated free

or external to them. He figuratively compared it to a mother liquor in

which crystals are formed. Either in the cytoblastema within the cells
or in that situated external to them, the aggregation of molecules around

a nucleolus to form a nucleus might occur, and, when once the nucleus
had been formed, in its turn it would serve as a centre of aggregation of

additional molecules from which a new cell would be produced. He

regarded therefore the formation of nuclei and cells as possible in two
ways : one within pre-existing cells (endogenous cell-formation), the other
in a free blastema lying external to cells (free cell-formation). In
animals, he says, the endogenous method is rare, and the customaiy origin
is in an external blastema. Both Schleiden and Schwann considered
that after the cell was formed the nucleus had no permanent influence
on the life of the cell, and usually disappeared.

     Under the teaching principally of Henle, the famous Pi'ofessor of
Anatomy in Gottingen, the conception of the free formation of nuclei and
cells in a more or less fluid blastema, by an aggregation of elementary
granules and molecules, obtained so much credence, especially amongst
those who were engaged in the study of pathological processes, that the
origin of cells within pre-existing cells was to a large extent lost sight of.
That a parent cell was requisite for the production of new cells seemed to
many investigators to be no longer needed. Without doubt this con-
ception of free cell-formation contributed in no small degree to the
belief, entertained by various observers, that the simplest plants and
animals might arise, without pre-existing parents, in organic fluids desti-
tute of life, by a process of spontaneous generation ; a belief which pre-
vailed in many minds almost to the present day. If, as has been stated,
the doctrine of abiogenesis cannot be experimentally refuted, on the other
hand it has not been experimentally proved. The burden of proof lies
with those who hold the doctrine, and the evidence that we possess is all

the other way.

                                         MultiiJlication of Cells.

     Although von Mold, the botanist, seems to have been the first to
recognise (1835) in plants a multiplication of cells by division, it was not
until attention was given to the study of the egg in various animals, and
to the changes which take place in it, attendant on fertilisation, that in

the course of time a much more correct conception of the origin of the
nucleus and of the part which it plays in the forpiation of new cells was
obtained. Before Schwann had published his classical memoir in 1839,
             1

ADDRESS.  1

von Baer and other observers had recognised within the animal ovum the
germinal vesicle, which obviously bore to the ovum the relation of a
nucleus to a cell. As the methods of observation improved, it was recog-
nised that, within the developing egg, two vesicles appeared where one
only had previously existed, to be followed by four vesicles, then
eight, and so on in multiple progression until the ovum contained a
multitude of vesicles, each of which possessed a nucleus. The vesicles

were obviously cells which had arisen within the original germ-cell or
ovum. These changes were systematically described by Martin Barry so
long ago as 1839 and 1840 in two memoirs communicated to the Royal
Society of London, and the appearance produced, on account of the irregu-

larities of the surface occasioned by the production of new vesicles, was

named by him the mulberry-like structure. He further pointed out that

the vesicles arranged themselves as a layer within the envelope of the egg
or zona pellucida, and that the whole embryo was composed of cells filled

with the foundations of other cells. He recognised that the new cells

were derived from the germinal vesicle or nucleus of the ovum, the con-
tents of which entered into the formation of the first two cells, each of

which had its nucleus, which in its turn resolved itself into other cells,
and by a repetition of the process into a greater number. The endogenous

origin of new cells within a pre-existing cell and the process which we
now term the segmentation of the yolk were successfully demonstrated.

In a third memoir, published in 1841, Barry definitely stated that young
cells originated through division of the nucleus of the parent cell, instead

of arising, as a product of crystallisation, in the fluid cytoblastema of the

parent cell or in a blastema situated external to the cell.

      In a memoir published in 1842, John Goodsir advocated the view that
the nucleus is the reproductive organ of the cell, and that from it, as from
a germinal spot, new cells were formed. In a paper, published three years
later, on nutritive centres, he described cells, the nuclei of which were
the permanent source of successive broods of young cells, which from

time to time occupied the cavity of the parent cell. He extended also his

 observations on the endogenous formation of cells to the cartilage cells in

 the process of inflammation and to other tissues undergoing pathological
 changes. Corroborative observations on endogenous formation were also
 given by his brother Harry Goodsir in 1845. These observations on the
 part which the nucleus plays by cleavage in the formation of young cells

--by endogenous development from a parent centre that an organic con-

 tinuity existed between a mother cell and its descendants through the

--nucleus constituted a great step in advance of the views entertained by

 Schleiden and Schwann, and showed that Barry and the Goodsirs had a
 deeper insight into the nature and functions of cells than was possessed
 by most of their contemporaries, and are of the highest importance when
 viewed in the light of recent observations.

     In 1841 Robert Remak published an account of the presence of two
--12 REPORT 1900.

nuclei in the blood corpuscles of the chick and the pig, which he regarded
as evidence of the production of new corpuscles by division of the
nucleus within a parent cell ; but it was not until some years afterwards
(1850 to 1855) that he recorded additional observations and recognised
that division of the nucleus was the starting-point for the multiplication

of cells in the ovum and in the tissues generally. Remak's view was that

the process of cell division began with the cleavage of the nucleolus,
followed by that of the nucleus, and that again by cleavage of the body
of the cell and of its membrane. Kolliker had previously, in 1843, de-
scribed the multiplication of nuclei in the ova of parasitic worms, and
drew the inference that in the formation of young cells within the egg
the nucleus underwent cleavage, and that each of its divisions entered

into the formation of a new cell. By these observations, and by others

subsequently made, it became obvious that the multiplication of animal
cells, either by division of the nucleus within the cell, or by the budding
off of a part of the protoplasm of the cell, was to be regarded as a widely
spread and probably a universal process, and that each new cell arose
from a parent cell.

     Pathological observers were, however, for the most part inclined to
consider free cell-formation in a blastema or exudation by an aggregation

of molecules, in accordance with the views of Henle, as a common pheno-
menon. This proposition was attacked with great energy by Virchow in

a series of memoirs published in his ' Archiv,' commencing in Vol. 1, 1847,
and finally received its death-blow in his published lectures on Cellular

Pathology, 1858. He maintained that in pathological structures there

was no Instance of cell development de novo ; where a cell existed, there
one must have been before. Cell-formation was a continuous develop-
meni, by descent, which he formulated in the expression omnis cellula

e celluld.

                                                     Karyokinesis.

     Whilst the descent of cells from pre-existing cells by division of the
nucleus during the development of the egg, in the embryos of plants
and animals, and in adult vegetable and animal tissues, both in healthy
and diseased conditions, had now become generally recognised, the
mechanism of the process by which the cleavage of the nucleus took place
was for a long time unknown. The discovery had to be deferred until
the optician had been able to construct lenses of a higher penetrative
power, and the microscopist had learned the use of colouring agents
capable of dyeing the finest elements of the tissues. There was reason to
believe that in some cases a direct cleavage of the nucleus, to be followed
by a corresponding division of the cell into two parts, did occur. In the
period between 1870 and 1880 observations were made by Schneider,
Strasburger, Biitschli, Fol, van Beneden, and Flemming, which showed that
the division of the nucleus and the cell was due to a series of very remark-
able changes, now known as indirect nuclear and cell division, or karyo-
          --

kinesis. The changes within the nucleus are of so complex a character that
it is impossible to follow them in detail without the use of appropriate
illustrations. I shall have to content myself, therefore, with an elemen-

tary sketch of the process.
     I have previously stated that the nucleus in its passive or resting stage

contains a very delicate network of threads or fibres. The first stage in

the process of nuclear division consists in the threads arranging them-
selves in loops and forming a compact coil within the nucleus. The coil
then becomes looser, the loops of threads shorten and thicken, and some-

what later each looped thread splits longitudinally into two portions. As
the threads stain when colouring agents are applied to them, they are

called chromatin fibres, and the loose coil is the chromosome (Waldeyer).

     As the process continues, the investing membrane of the nucleus dis-

appears, and the loops of threads arrange themselves within the nucleus

so that the closed ends of the loops are directed to a common centre, from

which the loops radiate outwards and produce a starlike figure (aster).

At the same time clusters of extremely delicate lines appear both in the
nucleoplasm and in the body of the cell, named the achromatic figure,
which has a spindle-like form with two opposite poles, and stains much

more feebly than the chromatic fibres. The loops of the chromatic star
then arrange themselves in the equatorial plane of the spindle, and
bending round turn their closed ends towards the periphery of the nucleus
and the cell.

     The next stage marks an important step in the process of division of
the nucleus. The two longitudinal portions, into which each looped thread
had previously split, now separate from each other, and whilst one part
migrates to one pole of the spindle, the other moves to the opposite pole,
and the free ends of each loop are directed towards its equator (meta-

kinesis). By this division of the chromatin fibres, and their separation

from each other to opposite poles of the spindle, two star like chromatin
figures are produced (dyaster).

      Each group of fibres thickens, shortens, becomes surrounded by a

membrane, and forms a new or daughter nucleus (dispirem). Two nuclei

therefore have arisen within the cell by the division of that which had
previously existed, and the expression formulated by Flemming omnis

--nucleus e nucleo is justified. Whilst this stage is in course of being

completed, the body of the cell becomes constricted in the equatorial plane
of the spindle, and, as the constriction deepens, it separates into two parts,
each containing a daughter nucleus, so that two nucleated cells have

arisen out of a pre-existing cell.

   A repetition of the process in each of these cells leads to the formation

of other cells, and, although modifications in details are found in diflferent
species of plants and animals, the multiplication of cells in the egg and in

the tissues generally on similar lines is now a thoroughly established fact

 in biological science;
--14 REPORT 1900,

     In the study of karyokinesis, importance has been attached to the
number of chromosomes in the nucleus of the cell. Flemming had seen
in the Salamander twenty-four chromosome fibres, which seems to be a
constant number in the cells of epithelium and connective tissues. In
other cells again, especially in the ova of certain animals, the number is
smaller, and fourteen, twelve, four, and even two only have been described.
The theory formulated by Boveri that the number of chromosomes is con-
stant for each species, and that in the karyokiuetic figures corresponding
numbers are found in homologous cells, seems to be not improbable.

     In the preceding description I have incidentally referred to the appear-
ance in the proliferating cell of an achromatic spindle-like figure. Al though
this was recognised by Fol in 1873, it is only during the last ten or twelve
years that attention has been paid to its more minute arrangements and

possible signification in cell-division.

     The pole at each end of the spindle lies in the cell plasm which sur-
rounds the nucleus. In the centre of each pole is a somewhat opaque
spot (central body) surrounded by a clear space, which, along with the
spot, constitutes the centrosome or the sphere of attraction. From each

centrosome extremely delicate lines may be seen to radiate in two direc-
tions. One set extends towards the pole at the opposite end of the spindle

and, meeting or coming into close proximity with radiations from it, con-
stitutes the body of the spindle, which, like a perforated mantle, forms
an imperfect envelope around the nucleus during the process of division.
The other set of radiations is called the polar, and extends in the region

of the pole towards the periphery of the cell.

     The question has been much discussed whether any constituent part

of the achromatic figure, or the entire figure, exists in the cell as a
permanent structure in its resting phase ; or if it is only present during
the process of karyokinesis. During the development of the egg the
formation of young cells, by division of the segmentation nucleus, is so
 rapid and continuous that the achromatic figure, with the centrosome in

 the pole of the spindle, is a readily recognisable object in each cell. The
 polar and spindle-like radiations are in evidence during karyokinesis,

 and have apparently a temporary endurance and function. On the

 other hand, van Beneden and Boveri were of opinion that the central
 body of the centrosome did not disappear when the division of the nucleus
 came to an end, but that it remained as a constituent part of a cell lying
 in the cell plasm near to the nucleus. Flemming has seen the central
 body with its sphere in leucocytes, as well as in epithelial cells and
 those of other tissues. Subsequently Heidenhain and other histologists
 have recorded similar observations. It would seem, therefore, as if there
 were reason to regard the centrosome, like the nucleus, as a permanent
  constituent of a cell. This view, however, is not universally entertained.
  If not always capable of demonstration in the resting stage of a cell, it is
  doubtless to be regarded as potentially present, and ready to assume^
ADDRESS.  15

along with the radiations, a, characteristic appearance when the process of

nuclear division is about to begin.

     One can scarcely regard the presence of so remarkable an appearance

as the achromatic figure without associating with it an important function

in the economy of the cell. As from the centrosome at the pole of

the spindle both sets of radiations diverge, it is not unlikely that it acts

as a centre or sphere of energy and attraction. By some observers the

radiations are regarded as substantive fibrillar structures, elastic or even

contractile in their propei'ties. Others, again, look upon them as morpho-
logical expressions of chemical and dynamical energy in the protoplasm of

the cell body. On either theory we may assume that they indicate an
influence, emanating, it may be, from the centrosome, and capable of

being exercised both on the cell plasm and on the nucleus contained

in it. On the contractile theory, the radiations which form the body

of the spindle, either by actual traction of the supposed fibrillas or by
their pressure on the nucleus which they surround, might impel during
karyokinesis the dividing chromosome elements towards the poles of the

spindle, to form there the daughter nuclei. On the dynamical theory,

the chemical and physical energy in the centrosome might influence the
cell plasm and the nucleus, and attract the chromosome elements of the
nucleus to the poles of the spindle. The radiated appearance would
therefore be consequent and attendant on the physico-chemical activity

of the centrosome. One or other of these theories may also be applied to

the interpretation of the significance of the polar radiations.

                                                    Cell Plasm.

     In the cells of plants, in addition to the cell wall, the cell body and
the cell juice require to be examined. The material of the cell body, or
the cell contents, was named by von Mohl (1846) protoplasm, and consisted
of a colourless tenacious substance which partly lined the cell wall
(primordial utricle), and partly traversed the interior of the cell as deli-
cate threads enclosing spaces (vacuoles) in which the cell juice was con-
tained. In the protoplasm the nucleus was embedded, Nageli, about the
same time, had also recognised the difference between the protoplasm and
the other contents of vegetable cells, and had noticed its nitrogenous com-

position.

     Though the analogy with a closed bladder or vesicle could no longer be
sustained in the animal tissues, the name ' cell ' continued to be retained
for descriptive purposes, and the body of the cell was spoken of as a

more or less soft substance enclosing a nucleus (Leydig). In 1861 Max

Schultze adopted for the substance forming the body of the animal cell

the term 'protoplasm.' He defined a cell to be a particle of protoplasm
in the substance of which a nucleus was situated. He regarded the

protoplasm, as indeed had previously been pointed out by the botanist
linger, as essentially the same as the contractile sarcode which
--16 REPORT 1900,

constitutes the body and pseudopodia of the Amoeba and other Rhizopoda.
As the term ' protoplasm,' as well as that of ' bioplasm ' employed by
Lionel Beale in a somewhat similar though not precisely identical sense,
involves certain theoretical views of the origin and function of the body
of the cell, it would be better to apply to it the more purely descriptive

term ' cytoplasm ' or ' cell plasm.'
     Schultze defined protoplasm as a homogeneous, glassy, tenacious

material, of a jelly-like or' somewhat firmer consistency, in which numerous

minute granules were embedded. He regarded it as the part of the cell

especially endowed with vital energy, whilst the exact function of the
nucleus could not be defined. Based upon this conception of the jelly-
like character of protoplasm, the idea for a time prevailed that a structure-
less, dimly granular, jelly or slime destitute of organisation, possessed
great physiological activity, and was the medium through which the
phenomena of life were displayed.

     More accurate conceptions of the nature of the cell plasm soon began
to be entertained. Briicke recognised that the body of the cell was not
simple, but had a complex organisation. Flemming observed that the
cell plasm contained extremely delicate threads, which frequently formed
a network, the interspaces of which were occupied by a more homo-
geneous substance. Where the threads crossed each other, granular

particles (mikrosomen) were situated. Biitschli considered that he could
recognise in the cell plasm a honeycomb-like appearance, as if it con-
sisted of excessively minute chambers in which a homogeneous more or
less fluid material was contained. The polar and spindle-like radiations
visible during the process of karyokinesis, which have already been
referred to, and the presence of the centrosome, possibly even during the

resting stage of the cell, furnished additional illustrations of differentiation

within the cell plasm. In many cells there appears also to be a difference

in the character of the cell plasm which immediately surrounds the nucleus
and that which lies at and near the periphery of the cell. The peri-
pheral part (ektoplasma) is more compact and gives a definite outline to
the cell, although not necessarily differentiating into a cell membrane.
The inner part (endoplasma) is softer, and is distinguished by a more
distinct granular appearance, and by containing the products specially
formed in each particular kind of cell during the nutritive process.

     By the researches of numerous investigators on the internal organisa-
tion of cells in plants and animals, a large body of evidence has now been

accumulated, which shows that both the nucleus and the cell plasm con-
sist of something more than a homogeneous, more or less viscid, slimy
material. Recognisable objects in the form of granules, threads, or fibres
can be distinguished in each. The cell plasm and the nucleus respectively
are therefore not of the same constitution throughout, but possess poly-
morphic characters, the study of which in health and the changes

produced by disease will for many years to come form important mattere

for investigation.
                                    ADDRESS.                                                17

                               Function of Cells.

     It has already been stated that, when new cells arise within pre-

existing cells, division of the nucleus is associated with cleavage of the

cell plasm, so that it participates in the process of new cell-formation.

Undoubtedly, however, its role is not limited to this function. It also
plays an important part in secretion, nutrition, and the special functions
discharged by the cells in the tissues and organs of which they form

morphological elements.

     Between 1838 and 1842 observations were made which showed that
cells were constituent pai-ts of secreting glands and mucous membranes
(Schwann, Henle). In 1842 John Goodsir communicated to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh a memoir on secreting structures, in which he

established the principle that cells are the ultimate secreting agents ; he
recognised in the cells of the liver, kidney, and othe» organs the character-

istic secretion of each gland. The secretion was, he said, situated between

the nucleus and the cell wall. At tirst he thought that, as the nucleus

was the reproductive organ of the cell, the secretion was formed in the

interior of the cell by the agency of the cell wall ; but three years later
he regarded it as a product of the nucleus. The study of the process of

spermatogenesis by his brother, Harry Goodsir, in which the head of the

spermatozoon was found to correspond with the nucleus of the cell in

which the spermatozoon arose, gave support to the view that the nucleus

played an important part in the genesis of the characteristic product

of the gland cell.

The physiological activity of the cell plasm and its complex chemical

constitution soon after began to be recognised. Some years before Max

Schultze had published his memoirs on the characters of protoplasm,

Briicke had shown that the well-known changes in tint in the skin of the

Chamjeleon were due to pigment granules situated in cells in the skin

which were sometimes diflused throughout the cells, at others concen-

trated in tlie centre. Similar observations on the skin of the froe

were made in 1854 by von Wittich and Harless. The movements were

regarded as due to contraction of the cell wall on its contents. In a

most interesting papei' on the pigmentary system in the frog, pub-

lished in 18.58, Lord Lister demonstrated that the pigment granules

moved in the cell plasma, by forces resident within the cell itself,

acting under the influence of an external stimulant, and not by a

contractility of the wall. Under some conditions the pigment was

attracted  to  the centre  of  the  cell, when  the  skin  became  pale                     under
                                                                                         ;

other conditions the pigment was diffused throughout the body and the

branches of the cell, and gave to the skin a dark colour. It was also

experimentally shown that a potent influence over these movements

was exercised by the nervous system.

 secretion is colourless, and the comparison of their appearance when
 secretion is going on with that seen when the cells are at rest, have
 shown that the cell plasm is much more granular and opaque, and con-
 tains larger particles, during activity than when the cell is passive ; the
 body of the cell swells out from an increase in the contents of its plasm, and
 chemical changes accompany the act of seci'etion. Ample evidence, there-
 fore, is at hand to support the position taken by John Goodsir, nearly
 sixty years ago, that secretions are formed within cells, and lie in that
 part of the cell which we now say consists of the cell plasm ; that each
 secreting cell is endowed with its own peculiar property, according to the

 organ in which it is situated, so that bile is formed by the cells in the

 liver, milk by those in the mamma, and so on.

       Intimately associated with the process of secretion is that of nutri-

tion. As the cell plasm lies at the periphery of a cell, and as it is, alike

 in secretion and nutrition, brought into closest relation with the sur-
 rounding medium, from which the pabulum is derived, it is necessarily
 associated with nutritive activity. Its position enables it to absorb
 nutritive material directly from without, and in the process of growth it
increases in amount by interstitial changes and additions throughout its
substance, and not by mere accretions on its surface.

      Hitherto I have spoken of a cell as a unit, independent of its
neighbours as regards its nutrition and the other functions which it has
to discharge. The question has, however, been discussed, whether in a

tissue composed of cells closely packed together cell plasm may not give

origin to processes or thi-eads which are in contact or continuous with

corresponding processes of adjoining cells, and that cells may therefore, to

some extent, lose their individuality in the colony of which they are
members. Appearances were recognised between 1863 and 1870 by
Schron and others in the deeper cells of the epidermis and of some
mucous membranes which gave sanction to this view, and it seems possible,
through contact or continuity of threads connecting a cell with its neigh-

bours, that cells may exercise a direct influence on each other.

      Nageli, the botanist, as the foundation of a mechanico-physiological
theory of descent, considered that in plants a network of cell plasm,

named by him idio-plasm, extended throughout the whole of the plant,
forming its specific molecular constitution, a)id that growth and activity
were regulated by its conditions of tension and movements (1884).

     The study of the structure of plants with special reference to the
presence of an intercellular network has for some years been pursued by
Walter Gardiner (1882 97), who has demonstrated threads of cell plasm
protruding through the walls of vegetable cells and continuous with

similar threads from adjoining cells. Structurally, therefore, a plant may

lie conceived to be built up of a nucleated cytoplasmic network, each
nucleus with the branching cell plasm surrounding it being a centre of

activity. On this view a cell would retain to some extent its individuality.
                                   ADDRESS.           19

though, as Gardiner contends, the connecting threads would be the medium
for the conduction of impulses and of food from a cell to those which lie
around it. For the plant cell therefore, as has long been accepted in the
animal cell, the wall is reduced to a secondary position, and the active con-

stituent is the nucleated cell plasm. It is not unlikely that the absence of a
controlling nervous system in plants requires the plasm of adjoinino- cells
to be brought into more immediate contact and continuity than is the
case with the generality of animal cells, so as to provide a mechanism for
harmonising the nutritive and other functional processes in the different
areas in the body of the plant. In this particular, it is of interest to note
that the epithelial tissues in animals, where somewhat similar connectin"'
arrangements occur, are only indirectly associated with the nervous and

vascular systems, so that, as in plants, the cells may require, for nutritive

and other purposes, to act and react directly on each other.

                                   Nerve, Cells,

Of recent years great attention has been paid to the intimate struc-

ture of nerve cells, and to the appearance which they present when in

Athe exercise of their functional activity.       nerve cell is not a secretin"-

cell ; that is, it does not derive from the blood or surrounding fluid a

pabulum which it elaborates into a visible, palpable secretion charac-

teristic of the organ of which the cell is a constituent element, to be in

due course discharged into a duct which conveys the secretion out of

the gland. Nerve cells, through the metabolic changes which take place

in them in connection with their nutrition, are associated with the pro-

duction of the form of energy termed nerve energy, specially exhibited

by animals which possess a nervous system. It has long been known

that every nerve cell has a body in which a relatively laro-e nucleus is
Asituated.
            most important discovery was the recognition that the body

of every nerve cell had one or more processes growing out from it. More

recently it has been proved, chiefly through the researches of Schultze

His, Golgi, and Ramon y Cajal, that at least one of the processes the

axon of the nerve cell, is continued into the axial cylinder of a nerve

fibre, and that in the multipolar nerve cell the other processes or

Adendrites, branch and ramify for some distance away from the bodv.

nerve fibre is therefore an essential part of the cell with which it is

continuous, and the cell, its processes, the nerve fibre and the collaterals

which arise from the nerve fibre collectively form a neuron or structural

nerve unit (Waldeyer). The nucleated body of the nerve cell is the

physiological centre of the unit.

     The cell plasm occupies both the body of the nerve cell and its pro-         *
cesses. The intimate stfucture of the plasm has, by improved methods
of observation introduced during the last eight years by Nissl and con-
ducted on similar lines by other investigators, become more definitely
understood. It has been ascertained that it possesses two distinct

                                                  c2

characters which imply different structures. One stains deeply oti the
addition of certain dyes, and is named chromophile or chromatic sub-

stance ; the other, which does not possess a similar property, is the
achromatic network. The chromophile is found in the cell body and

the dendritic processes, but not in the axon. It occurs in the foi'm

of granular particles, which may be scattered throughout the plasm, or

aggregated into little heaps which are elongated or fusiform in shape

and appear as distinct coloured particles or masses. The achromatic

network is found in the cell body and the dendrites, and is continued

also into the axon, where it forms the axial cylinder of the nerve fibre.

It consists apparently of delicate threads or fibrillaj, in the meshes of

which a homogeneous material, such as is found in cell plasm generally,

is contained. In the nerve cells, as in other cells, the plasm is without

doubt concerned in the process of cell nutrition. The achromatic fibrillaj

exercise an important influence on the axon or nerve fibre with which they

are continuous, and probably they conduct the nerve impulses which

manifest themselves in the form of nerve energy. The dendritic processes

of a multipolar nerve cell ramify in close relation with similar processes

branching from other cells in the same group. The collaterals and the

free end of the axon fibre process branch and ramify in association with

Wethe body of a nerve cell or of its dendrites.  cannot say that these

parts are directly continuous with each other to form an intercellular

network, but they are apparently in apposition, and through contact exer-

cise influence one on the other in the transmission of nerve impulses.

There is evidence to show that in the nerve cell the nucleus, as well

Whenas the cell plasm, is an effective agent in nutrition.  the cell is

functionally active, both the cell body and the nucleus increase in size
( Vas, G. Mann, Lugaro) ; on the other hand, when nerve cells are fatigued

through excessive use, the nucleus decreases in size and shrivels ; the cell
plasm also shrinks, and its coloured or chromophile constituent becomes

diminished in quantity, as if it had been consumed during the jjrolonged

use of the cell (Hodge, Maun, Lugaro). It is interesting also to note that

in hibernating animals in the winter season, when their functional activity

is reduced to a minimum, the chromophile in the plasm of the nerve cells
is much smaller in amount than when the animal is leading an active life
in the spring and summer (G. Levi).

    When a nerve cell has attained its normal size it does not seem to be

capable of reproducing new cells in its substance by a process of karyo-

kinesis, such as takes place when young cells arise in the egg and in the

tissues generally. It would appear that nerve cells are so highly special-

ised in their association with the evolution of nerve energy, that they
have ceased to have the power of reproducing their kind, and the
metabolic changes both in cell plasm and nucleus are needed to enable

them to discharge their very peculiar function. Hence it follows that
when a portion of the brain or other nerve-centre is destroyed, the
   ADDKESS.  21

    injury is not repaired by the production of fresh specimens of their
    characteristic cells, as would be the case in injuries to bones and tendons.

         In our endeavours to differentiate the function of the nucleus from

   that of the cell plasm, we should not regard the former as concerned
   only in the production of young cells, and the latter as the exclusive

    agent in growth, nutrition, and, where gland cells are concerned, in the

   formation of their characteristic products. As regards cell reproduction

   also, though the process of division begins in the nucleus in its chromo-
   some constituents, the achromatic figure in the cell plasm undoubtedly
   plays a part, and the cell plasm itself ultimately undergoes cleavage.

      A few years ago the tendency amongst biologists was to ignore or

   attach but little importance to the physiological use of the nucleus in the
   nucleated cell, and to regard the protoplasm as the essential and active

   constituent of living matter ; so much so, indeed, was this the case that

   independent organisms regarded as distinct species were described as con-
   sisting of protoplasm destitute of a nucleus ; also that scraps of proto-

   plasm separated from larger nucleated masses could, when isolated, exhibit

   vital phenomena. There is reason to believe that a fragment of protoplasm,

   when isolated from the nucleus of a cell, though retaining its contractility
   and capable of nourishing itself for a short time, cannot increase in amount,

   act as a secreting structure, or reproduce its kind : it soon loses its
   activity, withers, and dies. In order that these qualities of living matter
   should be retained, a nucleus is by most observers regarded as necessary
   (Nussbaum, Gruber, Haberlandt, Korschelt), and that for the complete
   manifestation of vital activity both nucleus and cell plasm are required.

                                                                Bacteria.

        The observations of Cohn, made about thirty years ago, and those of
   De Bary shortly afterwards, brought into notice a group of organisms to
   which the name ' bacterium ' or ' microbe ' is given. They were seen to vary
   in shape : some were rounded specks called cocci, others were straight rods
   called bacilli, others were curved or spiral rods, vibrios or spirillse. All were
   chai-acterised by their extreme minuteness, and required for their exami-

   nation the highest powers of the best microscopes. Many bacteria

   measure in their least diameter not more than ij^s-J-iroth of an inch,

   i\yth the diameter of a human white blood corpuscle. Through the re-

   searches of Pasteur, Lord Lister, Koch, and other observers, bacteria have
   been shown to play an important part in nature. They exercise a very re-
   markable power over organic substances, especially those which are com-
   plex in chemical constitution, and can resolve them into simpler combina-
   tions. Owing to this property, some bacteria are of great economic value,

   and without their agency many of our industries could not be pursued
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

   others again, and these are the most talked of, exercise a malign influ-

   ence in the production of the most deadly diseases which afflict man and

   the domestic animals.

I
--82 REPORT 1900.

     Great attention has been given to the structure of bacteria and to

their mode of propagation. When examined in the living state and

magnified about 2,000 times, a bacterium appears as a homogeneous par-
ticle, with a sharp definite outline, though a membranous envelope or
wall, distinct from the body of the bacterium, cannot at first be recog-
nised ; but when treated with reagents a membranous envelope appears,
the presence of which, without doubt, gives precision of form to the
bacterium. The substance within the membrane contains granules which
can be dyed with colouring agents. Owing to their extreme minuteness
it is difficult to pronounce an opinion on the nature of the chromatine
granules and the substance in which they lie. Some observers regard this
substance as nuclear material, invested by only a thin layer of protoplasm,
on which view a bacterium would be a nucleated cell. Others consider the
bacterium as formed of protoplasm containing granules capable of being
coloured, which are a part of the protoplasm itself, and not a nuclear sub-

stance. On the latter view, bacteria would consist of cell plasm enclosed

in a membrane and destitute of a nucleus. Whatever be the nature of

the granule-containing material, each bacterium is regarded as a cell, the
minutest and simplest living particle capable of an independent existence

that has yet been discovered.
     Bacteria cells, like cells generally, can reproduce their kind. They

multiply by simple fission, probably with an ingrowth of the cell wall, but
without the karyokinetic phenomena observed in nucleated cells. Each

cell gives rise to two daughter cells, which may for a time remain attached
to each other and form a cluster or a chain, or they may separate and
become independent isolated cells. The multiplication, under favourable

conditions of light, air, temperature, moisture, and food, goes on with

extraordinary rapidity, so that in a few hours many thousand new indi-
viduals may arise from a parent bacterium.

      Connected with the life-history of a bacterium cell is the formation in

its substance, in many species and under certain conditions, of a highly
 refractile shiny particle called a spore. At first sight a spore seems as if

 it were the nucleus of the bacterium cell, but it is not always present

 when multiplication by cleavage is taking place, and when present it does

not appear to take part in the fission. On the other hand, a spore, from

 the character of its envelope, possesses great power of resistance, so that
 dried bacteria, when placed in conditions favourable to germination, can
 through their spores germinate and resume an active existence. Spore
 formation seems, therefore, to be a provision for continuing the life of the
 bacterium under conditions which, if spores had not formed, would
 have been the cause of its death.

      The time has gone by to search for the origin of living organisms by a

 spontaneous aggregation of molecules in vegetable or other infusions, or
 from a layer of formless primordial slime diffused over the bed of the ocean.
 Living matter during our epoch has been, and continues to be, derived
ADDRESS.  23

from pre-existing living matter, even when it possesses the simplicity of
structure of a bacterium, and the morphological unit is the cell.

                                         Development of the Egg.

     As the future of the entire organism lies in the fertilised egg cell, we
may now briefly review the arrangements, consequent on the process of

segmentation, which lead to the formation, let us say in the egg of a
bird, of the embryo or young chick.

      In the latter part of the last century, C. F. Wolff observed that the
beginning of the embryo was associated with the formation of layers, and
in 1817 Pander demonstrated that in the hen's egg at first one layer,
called mucous, appeared, then a second or serous layer, to be followed by a
third, intermediate or vascular layer. In 1828 von Baer amplified our
knowledge in his famous treatise, which from its grasp of the subject

created a new epoch in the science of embryology. It was not, however,
until the discovery by Schwann of cells as constant factors in the struc-
ture of animals and in their relation to development that the true nature
of these layers was determined. "We now know that each layer consists
of cells, and that all the tissues and organs of the body are derived from
them. Numerous observers have devoted themselves for many years to

the study of each layer, with the view of determining the share which it
takes in the formation of the constituent parts of the body, more especially
in the higher animals, and the important conclusion has been arrived at

that each kind of tissue invariably arises from one of these layers and
from no other.

     The layer of cells which contributes, both as regards the number and
variety of the tissues derived from it, most largely to the formation of the
body is the middle layer or mesoblast. From it the skeleton, the muscles,
and other locomotor organs, the true skin, the vascular system, including
the blood, and other structures which I need not detail, take their rise.
From the inner layer of cells or hypoblast, the principal derivatives are the
epithelial lining of the alimentary canal and of the glands which open into
it, and the epithelial lining of the air-passages. The outer or epiblast layer
of cells gives origin both to the epidermis or scarf skin and to the nervous
system. It is interesting to note that from the same layer of the embryo

--arise parts so different in importance as the cuticle a mere protecting

structure, which is constantly being shed when the skin is subjected to the

--friction of a towel or the clothes and the nervous system, including the

Howbrain, the most highly differentiated system in the animal body.

completely the cells from which they are derived had diverged from each
other in the course of their differentiation in structure and properties is
shown by the fact that the cells of the epidermis are continually engaged

in reproducing new cells to replace those which are shed, whilst the cells
of the nervous systeip have apparently lost the power of reproducing

their kind.
--24 REPORT 1900.

In the early stage of the development of the egg, the cells in a given

layer resemble each other in form, and, as far as can be judged from their

appearance, are alike in structure and properties. As the development

proceeds, the cells begin to show differences in character, and in the course

of time the tissues which arise in each layer differentiate from each other
and can be readily recognised by the observer. To use the language of

von Baer, a generalised structure has become specialised, and each of the

special tissues produced exhibits its own structure and properties. These

changes are coincident with a rapid multiplication of the cells by cleavage,

and thus increase in size of the embryo accompanies specialisation of

structure. As the process continues, the embryo gradually assumes the

shape characteristic of the species to which its parents belonged, until at

length it is fit to be born and to assume a separate existence.

The conversion of cells, at first uniform in character, into tissues of a

diverse kind is due to forces inherent in the cells in each layer. The cell

plasm plays an active though not an exclusive part in the specialisation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

for as the nucleus influences nutrition and secretion, it acts as a factor in

Whenthe differentiation of the tissues.  tissues so diverse in character as

muscular fibre, cartilage, fibrous tissues, and bone arise from the cells of the

middle or mesoblast layer, it is obvious that, in addition to the morphological

differentiation affecting form and structure, a chemical differentiation affect-

ing composition also occurs, as the result of which a physiological differen-

tiation takes place. Corresponding differentiations also modify the cells

of the outer and inner layers. The tissues and organs become fitted to

transform the energy derived from the food into muscular energy, nerve

energy, and other forms of vital activity. Hence the study of the develop-

ment of the generalised cell layers in the young embryo enables us to

realise how all the complex constituent parts of the body in the higher

animals and in man are evolved by the process of cell growth and differen-

-- Atiation from a simple nucleated cell the fertilised ovum.    knowledge

of the cell and of its life-history is therefore the foundation-stone on

which biological science in all its departments is based.

     If we are to understand by an organ in the biological sense a complex

body capable of carrying on a natural process, a nucleated cell is an organ

in its simplest form. In a unicellular animal or plant such an organ

exists in its most primitive stage. The higher plants and animals again

are built up of multitudes of these organs, each of which, whilst having

its independent life, is associated with the others, so that the whole may

act in unison for a common purpose. As in one of your great factories

each spindle is engaged in twisting and winding its own thread, it is at

the same time intimately associated with the hundreds of other spindles

in its immediate proximity, in the manufacture of the yarn from which
the web of cloth is ultimately to be woven.

It has taken more than fifty years of hard and continuous work to

bring our Jinowledge of the structure and development of the tissues and
ADDRESS.  25

organs of plants and animals up to the level of the present day. Amidst
the host of names of investigators, both at home and abroad, who have con-

tributed to its progress, it may seem invidious to particularise individuals.

There are, however, a few that I cannot forbear to mention, whose claim
to be named on such an occasion as this will be generally conceded.

     Botanists will, I think, acknowledge Wilhelm Hofmeister as a- master
in morphology and embryology, Julius von Sachs as the most important
investigator in vegetable physiology during the last quarter of the century,
and Strasburger as a leader in the study of the phenomena of nuclear

division.

     The researches of the veteran Professor of Anatomy in Wiirzburg,

Albert von Kolliker, have covered the entire field of animal histology.
His first paper, published fifty-nine years ago, was followed by a suc-

cession of memoirs and books on human and comparative histology and

embryology, and culminated in his great treatise on the structure of the
brain, published in 1896. Notwithstanding the weight of more than
eighty years, he continues to prosecute histological research, and has
published the results of his latest, though let us hope not his last, work
during the present year.

     Amongst our own countrymen, and belonging to the generation which
has almost passed away, was William Bowman. His investigations
between 1840 and 1850 on the mucous membranes, muscular fibre,

and the structure of the kidney, together with his researches on the
organs of sense, were characterised by an acuteness of observation and of
interpreting diflicult and complicated appearances which has made bis
memoirs on these subjects landmarks in the history of histological

inquiry.

      Of the younger generation of biologists Francis Maitland Balfour,
whose early death is deeply deplored as a loss to British science, was
one of the most distinguished. His powers of observation and philosophic
perception gave him a high place as an original inquirer, and the charm of

--his personality for charm is not the exclusive possession of the fairer

sex--endeared him to his friends.

                                             General Morphology.

     Along with the study of the origin and structure of the tissues of
organised bodies, much attention has been given during the century to
the parts or organs in plants and animals, with the view of determining
where and how they take their rise, the order of their formation, the
changes which they pass through in the early stages of development, and
their relative positions in the organism to which they belong. Investi-
gations on these lines are spoken of as morphological, and are to be dis-
tinguished from the study of their physiological or functional relations,
though both are necessary for the full comprehension of the living

organism.
26 REPORT-- 1900,

     The first to recognise that morphological relations might exist between
the organs of a plant, dissimilar as regards their function, was the poet
Goethe, whose observations, guided by his imaginative faculty, led him to
declare that the calyx, corolla, and other parts of a flower, the scales of a
bulb, (fee, were metamorphosed leaves, a principle generally accepted by
botanists, and indeed extended to other parts of a plant, which are referred
to certain common morphological forms although they exercise different
functions. Goethe also applied the same principle in the study of the
skeletons of vertebrate animals, and he formed the opinion that the spinal
column and the skull were essentially alike in construction, and consisted
of vertebrpe, an idea which was also independently conceived and advocated

by Oken.
     The anatomist who in our country most strenuously applied himself to

the morphological study of the skeleton was Richard Owen, whose know-
ledge of animal structure, based upon his own dissections, was unrivalled

in range and variety. He elaborated the conception of an ideal, archetype

vertebrate form which had no existence in nature, and to which, subject

to modifications in various directions, he considered all vertebrate skeletons
might be referred. Owen's observations were conducted to a large extent
on the skeletons of adult animals, of the knowledge of which he was a

master. As in the course of development modifications in shape and in

the relative position of parts not unfrequently occur and their original
character and place of origin become obscured, it is difficult, from the study

only of adults, to arrive at a correct interpretation of their morphological

significance. When the changes which take place in the skull during its

development, as worked out by Reichert and Rathke, became known and
their value had become appreciated, many of the conclusions arrived at by
Owen were challenged and ceased to be accepted. It is, however, due to

that eminent anatomist to state from my personal knowledge of the

condition of anatomical science in this country fifty years ago, that an
enormous impulse was given to the study of comparative morphology
by his writings, and by the criticisms to which they were subjected.

     There can be no doubt that generalised arrangements do exist in the

early embryo which, up to a certain stage, are common to animals that

in their adult condition present diverse characters, and out of which the

forms special to different groups are evolved. As an illustration of this
principle, I may refer to the stages of development of the great arteries

in the bodies of vertebrate animals. Originally, as the observations of

Rathke have taught us, the main arteries are represented by pairs of
symmetrically arranged vascular arches, some of which enlarge and con-
stitute the permanent arteries in the adult, whilst others disappear. The
increase in size of some of these arches, and the atrophy of others, are so

constant for different groups that they constitute anatomical features

as distinctive as the modifications in the skeleton itself. Thus in mam-

mals the fourth vascular arch on the left side persists, and forms the arch

of  the aorta                                 in  birds the corresponding part  of  the  aorta is an enlarge-
                                           ;

ment of the fourth right arch, and in reptiles both arches persist to form

the great artery. That this original symmetry exists also in man we
know from the fact that now and again his body, instead of correspond-

ing with the mammalian type, has an aortic arch like that which is

Anatural to the bird, and in rarer cases even to the reptile.                            type form

common to the vertebrata does therefore in sucli cases exist, capable of

evolution in more than one direction.

    The reputation of Thomas Henry Huxley as a philosophic compara-

tive anatomist rests largely on his eai'ly perception of, and insistence on,

the necessity of testing morphological conclusions by a reference to the

development of parts and organs, and by applying this principle in his own

investigations. The prin ciple is now so generally accepted by both botanists

and anatomists that morphological definitions are regarded as depending

essentially on the successive phases of the development of the parts

under consideration.

    The morphological characters exhibited by a plant or animal tend

to be hereditarily transmitted from parents to offspring, and the

species is perpetuated. In each species the evolution of an individual,

through the developmental changes in the egg, follows the same lines in

all the individuals of the same species, which possess therefore in common

the features called specific characters. The transmission of these charac-

ters is due, according to the theory of Weismann, to certain properties

possessed by the chromosome constituents of the segmentation nucleus in
the fertilised ovum, named by him the germ plasm, which is continued

from one generation to another, and impresses its specific character on the

egg and on the plant or animal developed from it.

    As has already been stated, the special tissues which build up the bodies

of the more complex organisms are evolved out of cells which are at first

simple in form and appearance. During the evolution of the individual,

cells become modified or differentiated in structure and function, and

so long as the differentiation follows certain prescribed lines the morpho-

Welogical characters of the species are preserved.                                       can readily conceive

that, as the process of specialisation is going on, modifications or variations

in groups of cells and the tissues derived from them, notwithstanding the

influence of heredity, may in an individual diverge so far from that which

is characteristic of the species as to assume the arrangements found in

another species, or even in another order. Anatomists had indeed long

recognised that variations from the customary ari-angement of parts

occasionally appeared, and they described such deviations from the current

descriptions as irregularities.

                                       Darwinian Theory.

     The signification of the variations which arise in plants and animals
had not been apprehended until a flood of light was thrown on the entire
--28 REPORT 1000.

subject by the genius of Charles Darwin, who formulated the wide-
reaching theory that variations could be transmitted by heredity to
younger generations. In this manner he conceived new characters would
arise, accumulate, and be perjaetuated, which would in the course of time

assume specific importance. New species might thus be evolved out of

organisms originally distinct from them, and their specific characters would

in turn be transmitted to their descendants. By a continuance of this pro-
cess new species would multiply in many directions, until at length from one

or more originally simple forms the earth would become peopled by the
infinite varieties of plant and animal organisms which have in past ages

inhabited, or do at present inhabit, our globe. The Darwinian theory may

therefore be defined as Heredity modified and influenced by Variability.
It assumes that there is an heredity quality in the egg which, if we take

the common fowl for an example, shall continue to produce similar fowls.
Under conditions, of which we are ignorant, which occasion molecular

changes in the cells and tissues of the developing egg, variations might
arise, in the first instance probably slight, but becoming intensified in
successive generations, until at length the descendants would have lost

the characters of the fowl and have become another species. No

precise estimate has been arrived at, and indeed one does not see how it is

possible to obtain it, of the length of years which might be required to

convert a variation, capable of being transmitted, into a new and definite

specific character.

     The circumstances which, according to the Darwinian theory, deter-
mined the perpetuation by hereditary transmission of a variety and its
assumption of a specific character depended, it was argued, on whether it
possessed such properties as enabled the plant or animal in which it

appeared to adapt itself more readily to its environment, i.e. to the
surrounding conditions. If it were to be of use the organism in so far

became better adapted to hold its own in the struggle for existence with

its fellows and with the forces of nature operating on it. Through
the accumulation of useful characters the specific variety was perpetuated
by natural selection so long as the conditions were favourable for its
existence, and it survived as being the best fitted to live. In the study

of the transmission of variations which may arise in the course of develop-

ment it should not be too exclusively thought that only those variations
are likely to be preserved which can be of service during the life of the
individual, or in the perpetuation of the species, and possibly available for
the evolution of new species. It should also be kept in mind that
morphological characters can be transmitted by hereditary descent,

which, though doubtless of service in some bygone ancestor, are in

the new conditions of life of the species of no physiological value.
Our knowledge of the structural and functional modifications to be
found in the human body, in connection with abnormalities and with

tendencies or predisposition to diseases of various kinds, teaches us that
ADDRESS.  29

characters which are of no use, and indeed detrimental to the individual

may be hex'editarily transmitted from parents to offspring through a suc-

cession of generations.

     Since the conception of the possibility of the evolution of new species
from pre-existing forms took possession of the minds of naturalists,
attempts have been made to trace out the lines on which it has proceeded.
The first to give a systematic account of what he conceived to be the order
of succession in the evolution of animals was Ernst Haeckel, of Jena, in
a well-known treatise. Memoirs on special departments of the subject,
too numerous to particularise, have subsequently appeared. The problem
has been attacked along two different lines : the one by embryologists,

of whom may be named Kowalewsky, Gegenbaur, Dohrn, Ray Lankester,
Balfour, and Gaskell, who with many others have conducted careful and

methodical inquiries into the stages of development of numerous forms
belonging to the two great divisions of the animal kingdom. Inverte-
brates, as well as vertebrates, have been carefully compared with each
other in the bearing of their development and structure on their affinities
and descent, and the possible sequence in the evolution of the Vertebrata
from the Invertebrata has been discussed. The other method pursued by

palaeontologists, of whom Huxley, Marsh, Cope, Osborne, and Traquair

are prominent authorities, has been the study of the extinct forms pre-
served in the rocks and the comparison of their structure with each other
and with that of existing organisms. In the attempts to trace the line of
descent the imagination has not unfrequently been called into play in con-
structing various conflicting hypotheses. Though from the nature of thin^^s
the order of descent is, and without doubt will continue to be, ever a matter
of speculation and inference and not of demonstration, the study of the
subject has been a valuable intellectual exercise and a powerful stimulant

to research.

   We know not as regards time when the fiat went forth, ' Let there be

Life, and there was Life.' All we can say is that it must have been in
the far-distant past, at a period so remote from the present that the mind

fails to grasp the duration of the interval. Pi'ior to its genesis our earth

consisted of barren rock and desolate ocean. When matter became

endowed with Life, with the capacity of self-maintenance and of

resisting external disintegrating forces, the face of nature began to
undergo a momentous change. Living organisms multiplied, the land
became covered with vegetation, and multitudinous varieties of plants,
from the humble fungus and moss to the stately palm and oak, beautified
its surface and fitted it to sustain higher kinds of living beings. Animal
forms appeared, in the first instance simple in structure, to be followed by

others more complex, until the mammalian type was produced. The
ocean also became peopled with plant and animal organisms, from the
microscopic diatom to the huge leviathan. Plants and animals acted and
--30 REPORT 1900.

reacted on each other, on the atmosphere which surrounded them and on
the earth on which they dwelt, the surface of which became modified in

character and aspect. At last Man came into existence. His nerve-energy,

in addition to regulating the processes in his economy which he possesses

in common with animals, was endowed with higher powers. When trans-

lated into psychical activity it has enabled him throughout the ages
to progress from the condition of a rude savage to an advanced stage
of civilisation ; to produce works in literature, art, and philosophy which
have exerted, and must continue to exert, a lasting influence on the
development of his higher Being ; to make discoveries in natural and
physical science ; to acquire a knowledge of the structure of the earth,
of the ocean in its changing aspects, of the atmosphere and the stellar
universe, of the chemical composition and physical properties of matter
in its various forms, and to analyse, comprehend, and subdue the forces

of nature.

    By the application of these discoveries to his own purposes Man has, to

a large extent, overcome time and space ; he has studded the ocean with
steamships, girdled the earth with the electric wire, tunnelled the lofty
Alps, spanned the Forth with a bridge of steel, invented machines and
founded industries of all kinds for the promotion of his material welfare,
elaborated systems of government fitted for the management of great
communities, foi'mulated economic principles, obtained an insight into
the laws of health, the causes of infective diseases, and the means of
controlling and preventing them.

     When we reflect that many of the most important discoveries in abs-

tract science and in its applications have been made during the present
century, and indeed since the British Association held its first meeting in
the ancient capital of your county sixty-nine years ago, we may look
 forward with confidence to the future. Every advance in science provides
 a fresh platform from which a new start can be made. The human intel-
 lect is still in process of evolution. The power of application and of
 concentration of thought for the elucidation of scientific problems is by
 no means exhausted. In science is no hereditary aristocracy. The army
 of workers is recruited from all classes. The natural ambition of even

 the private in the ranks to maintain and increase the reputation of the
 branch of knowledge which he cultivates affords an ample guarantee
 that the march of science is ever onwards, and justifies us in proclaiming
 for the next century, as in the one fast ebbing to a close, that Great is
 Science, and it will prevail.

on Mount Royal, Montreal.

                                                 [PLATE I.]

The following preliminary report lias been received from the observers :

The difference of temperature between the College Observatory and

the top of Mount Royal is continuously recorded by means of a Callendar

Electric Recorder and a pair of differential platinum thermometers. The

thermometers are of the usual pattern, giving a change of 2 ohms for

100° Fahr., and the scale of the record is one-fifth of an inch to the

degree Fahr. By a simple change in the connections the actual tempera-

ture at either station can be recorded separately instead of the difference

of temperature between the two. The thermometer at the top of the

mountain is placed on a platform 50 feet above the ground and 850 feet

above sea level. The other thermometer is at a height of 4 feet above the

ground, and 180 feet above sea level. The distance between the two is

rather more than a mile. The recoi'der is placed in the College Oliserva-

tory at the lower station, and is connected to the distant thermometer by

four separate lines of No. 12 copper wire erected on poles with glass

insulators, and covered with weather-j^roof insulation ordinarily used for

telephone work. The recorder is of the original Callendar pattern, and

was made at the McDonald Physics Building in 1897.

The line to the mountain has been broken by storm on several occa-

sions                  parts of  it have sometimes   been  carried away by thieves ;    on one
                    ;

occasion the line Avas struck by lightning, the thermometers were de-

stroyed, and the instrument burnt out ; on another occasion the instrument

was burnt out through an accidental short cii-cuit of the electric lighting

current. The original thermometers which were damaged by lightning

have been replaced by new and improved instruments, and all other

damages have been repaired, so that the whole apparatus is at present in

good running condition. Great delay has been caused by these accidents
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and this, coupled with pressure of other work on the observers, has made

it impossible to secure up to the present date a sufficiently extended series

of observations to be of value for the general discussion of results. To
show the nature of the records, and the working of the apparatus, a
sample record sheet for August 21, 22, 1900, including a zero test and two
comparisons with mercury thermometers, which were read simultaneously
at the two stations by separate observers, is given herewith. (Plate I.)

     The zero line on the chart was obtained by placing the thermometers
at the two stations in melting ice simultaneously, and allowing them to
remain for about an hour at this temperature. The differences between
the simultaneous readings of the mercury thermometers at the two stations
were plotted from this zero line, and show a very satisfactory agreement
with the differential platinum thermometers, considering the continual
variations of temperature and the difference in sensibility of the two
instruments. The direction of the wind and the velocity in miles per
hour are recorded by instruments placed on the summit and connected by

lines to the electrical recording apparatus in the College Observatory at

the lower station. The record for August 21, 22 exhibits a complete
revolution in the direction of the wind from N.W. through E. and S. and

back to N.W. These changes in the direction of the wind frequently
 appear to be related to the changes in the difference of temperature. The
amount of sunshine in tenths per hour recorded at the College Observa-

 tory is also marked on the charts, and the general weather conditions

 prevailing.

      The apparatus as at present arranged gives admirable results in fair
 weather, but it has been found impossible to preserve the insulation of the
 line during rain. This has steadily deteriorated since its erection, and
 the results cannot now be relied on when the rainfall is considerable, or
.for short periods after. This is unfortunate, as it would be interesting to
 study the changes of temperature occurring with the onset of rain. To
 completely obviate the insulation defects in bad weather, and to protect
 the line from thieves and lightning, it would be necessary to replace the

 present pole line with a lead-covered cable buried in the ground. It is

 hardly necessary to say that this was foreseen at the time when the line
 was originally projected, as all installations of platinum thermometers up
 to that date had been provided with lead-covered cables, especially in
 cases where the distance involved was considerable. The original estimate
 of 100?. for the apparatus was based on the assumption of a lead-covered
 cable. But wheii the British Association in 1897 were unable to grant
 more than 50/., it was decided to utilise the existing pole line rather than
 abandon the project entirely. There is still some hope that the necessary
 funds may be forthcoming for the replacement of the existing line by a
 cable ; but until this necessary improvement is effected it is feared that
 the scientific value of the work must be seriously impaired.

tables are given showing the values obtained for the ionisation. The
measurements of the freezing points of the same solutions, undertaken by
Mr. Griffiths, are still in progress. It is hoped that his results will soon

be ready, and that a useful comparison of the two lines of research may

then be made.
     The consumption of a carbon anode in electrolysis has formed the

subject of some experiments by another member of the Committee,
Mr. Skinner. 1 Carbofa electrodes are used in many electrotechhical
processes, and their solution and disintegration forto one of the chief

difficulties to be overcome. It appears that -v^rhenever a highly oxidised

product undergoes electrolytic deicotnposition the anion gives, directly or

indirectly, a considerable quantity of carbonic acid. The experiments
show that as much as 85 per cent, of the escaping gdses consists of carboh
dioxide when a solution of potassium permangaliate is the electrolyte.

     Since the publication in 1897 of the Committee's Report on the
Theot-y of the Migration of Ions and of Specific Ionic Velocities, an

important paper by Orme Masson has appeared,- giving an account Of an

experimental method of measuring ionid velocities and of the Results for a
number of ions.

     The original plan of the Committee, as arranged in 1890, included

--reports on the following additional sections : § d. Electro-chemical

Thermo- dynamics ; § e. Electric Endosmose ; and %g. Numerical Relations.
Information on some of these sections has already been made easily

accessible.

   A small book,' ' Das Leitvermogen der Electrolyte,' Leipzig) 1898, has

been published by Dr. von Kohlrausch and Dr. Holborn, giving a complete
account of the method of measuring electrolytic conductivity by means of

alternating currents in conjunction with a telephone, with the precautions

necessary for accurate results. There are also tables of the conductivity

of certain solutions, which may be used to standardise resistance vessels.
     The thet-mo-dynamics of electrolytic processes is in some degree

covered by a Report by Professor E. F. J . Love on our Knowledge of the
Thermo-dynamics of the Voltaic Cell, published by the Australasian
Association for the Advancement of Science, Sydney, 1898.

     Since the original appointment of the Committee, very toaany and
important researches upon the chemical phenomena resulting from or
associated with the passage of electricity through gases have been

published.

     In order to make the Committee's Report in any way a complete
sketch of the subject of electro-chemistry as now developed, its scope
would have to be enlarged to include such phenomena as the conductivity

of gases at high temperatures, and under the influence of other ionising
agencies. The Committee feel unable to undertake such an extension of
their work, and do not seek reappointment.

As already reported, the copper-cube actinometcr constructed for this

Committee, and described in the Report for 1886, was entrusted to
Professor Callendar in August 1899 for comparison with his automatic
recording instrument described in the Report for 1898. In the course of
the past year a number of experiments have been made with this

apparatus by Miss W. E. Walker, 1851 Exhibition Scholar, working at

University College, London, under the direction of Professor Callendar.
The object of the work was to obtain absolute measurements of radiation
for the calibration of the more convenient form of continuous recorder.
In its original form the copper-cube actinometer was not very well
adapted, and probably was not intended, for absolute measurements ; but
with some modifications very promising results have been already obtained,
and it is believed that the method thus modified will lead to trustworthy
and valuable determinations.

     The history of the copper-cube actinometer is contained in various
reports communicated by this committee, of which the following is a brief
summary. The method originally proposed was to concentrate the rays
of the sun by means of a lens through a hole in one side of the cube on to
a central mercury thermometer with a flat bulb. The steady difference
of temperature between the central thermometer and the walls of the
 cube would be approximately proportional to the intensity of solar
 radiation, and might be taken as a measure of the same in arbitrary units.
To obtain the equivalent in absolute measure it would be necessary to
know the rate of cooling of the thermometer and the coefficient of
 absorption of the bulb and of the lens by which the rays were concentrated
 These might huxe been obtained by auxiliary experiments on the i-ate of
 heating or cooling under various conditions ; but as the mercuiy thermo-
 meters proved unsuitable in many respects, the apparatus was subsequently
 modified by the substitution of a copper disc and a thermo-j unction for

 the central thermometer. This permitted the observation of smaller

 differences of temperature and the more accurate determination of the
 thermal capacity of the irradiated disc.

      The elementary theory of the instrument, assuming that for small
 differences of temperature the rate of cooling of the disc would be pro-
 portional to the difference of temperature between the disc and the walls
 of the cube, was given in the Report of the Committee for 1892. If 6 is
 the excess of temperature of the disc over the enclosure at any time t

The limiting steady temperature of the disc when t is infinite is 6°=r/q.

In 1893 some experiments were recorded verifying the elementary

theory and the constancy of the coefficient of cooling q. In 1896 a
photographic recording device was applied to obtain the curves of heating

of the disc by registering the deflections of the D'Arsonval galvanometer

on a moving photographic plate. The curves proved to be approximately

logarithmic, but the reduction of the results to absolute measure was not

attempted.

   --Absolute Measurements. If I be the intensity of radiation to be

Ameasured in watts per square centimetre, and be the area in square

centimetres normal to the rays over which the measured portion of the

radiation is incident, the quantity of heat received is lA joules per second.

This is equal to rSms, where r as already defined is the initial rate of rise

of temperature of the disc when exposed to the radiation, J is the number

mof joules in one calorie, which may be taken as approximately 4"18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         is
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the mass, and s the specific heat of the disc. In applying this method it is

tacitly assumed that the whole of the disc is at a uniform temperature at

any moment during the rise of temperature ; it is also necessary to know

accurately the specific heat s of the material of the disc, and to be able

to calibrate the thermo-junction so as to interpret the indications of the

galvanometer in degrees of temperature. Further, the rise of temperature

must not exceed two or three degrees in order that q, the coefficient of

cooling, may be taken as constant, and the rate of rise must be sufficiently

slow to jDermit of accurate measurement, and of the uniform diffusion of

heat throughout the disc.

After some preliminary experiments with the apparatus it became

evident that these conditions were not sufficiently satisfied by the disc

and thermo-junction employed in the experiments already recorded. The

disc was about two centimetres in diameter and half a millimetre thick.

The aperture for admitting the radiation was about one centimetre.

Under these conditions it was not possible without the use of lenses to

ensure a sufficiently uniform distribution of the radiation over the surface

of the disc, and the rate of rise of temperature was too rapid for accurate

measurement. The disc was supported on a short iron wire nearly
two millimetres thick, which conducted heat away from the centre of the

disc so rapidly that the temperature of the junction was always very con-

siderably below that of the disc. Owing to its form the thermo-junction

could not be accurately calibrated, and the sensitiveness of the copper-iron

couple, though suitable for powerful sources such as direct solar radiation,
was far too small for accurate work with sources of constant intensity

such as were required for absolute measurement.

     The Galvanometer supplied with the instrument was of the Ayrton
Mather type, with a resistance of about 7 '5 ohms, and gave a deflection of

about 2 millimetres at 1 metre per microvolt, equivalent to about

20 millimetres per degree with a copper-iron junction. In orcler to
38 REPORT--iPnO.

increase the accuracy of reading, a good plane mirror was substituted for
the original concave mirror, and observations were taken with a telescope
and scale at a distance of about 3 metres. The definition of the imago
was such as to permit of reading with accuracy to a fifth of a millimetre.
Owing to the gradual change or ' drift ' of zero, due to imperfect elasticity
of the suspension, which is always a serious source of error in galvano-
meters of this type, it was found to be impossible to obtain sufficiently
consistent observations by the deflection method. To ininimise this
source of error the potentiometer balance-method was adopted, and care
was taken not to subject the suspension to excessive torsion. To increase
the sensitiveness, the iron-copper thermo-junction was replaced by junctions
of iron and gei'man silver (30 microvolts per degree), and iron and con-

-- --stantan (52 microvolts). The wires employed for this purpose were very

fine about 0"2 millimetre to minimise the cooling of the junctions by
conduction, and their thermo-electric powers were determined by a special
series of observations made on the particular pieces employed. Witli
these improvements it was optically possible to observe a difference of
temperature of a thousandth of a degree with certainty, as it corresponded
to a deflection of about a quarter of a millimetre with the iron and
constantan couple.

   --Thermo-electric Sources of Error. In observing small differences of

temperature with a thermo-couple, assuming that drift of the galvano-
meter zero is avoided by employing the balance method, the most trouble-
some residual errors arise from accidental thermal effects due to small
differences of temperature in other parts of the electric circuit, and in
particular at the junctions of the bridge-wire, and at the point of contact
of the slider. Tt is usual to employ german-silver or platinoid or platinum
silver as the material for the bridge-wire to secure a low temperature-
coefficient and high specific resistance. Unfortunately these materials

give large thermal effects when joined to copper. The alloy known as

manganin is greatly to be preferred to platinoid or constantan in this
respect, but its surface is more liable to tarnish. The superiority of the
bolometric method (platinum resistance) over the thermo-couple for accu-
rate measurement of small differences of temperature depends chiefly on

the relative ease with which these accidental thermal effects may be

eliminated. In the present instance they were found to be so trouble-

some that it was eventually decided to make the bridge-wire and the

whole of the circuit, with the exception of the couple itself, of pure

copper. By adopting this method the accidental disturbances were

reduced to a small fraction of a microvolt, without taking any special
precautions to secure uniformity of temperature throughout the various
parts of the measuring apparatus. The cold junctions of the thermo-
couple were contained in a copper plug screwing into the copper cube,
and were assumed to be at the same temperature as the walls of the cube.
In order to secure this, and to minimise changes of temperature of the
copper cube, it was found necessary to wrap the cube and the projecting
plug in a considerable thickness of cotton-wool, even when exposed to
feeble sources of radiation. The layer of felt surrounding the cube formed
 no protection for the copper plug containing the cold junction, and proved
quite inadequate to prevent rapid changes of temperature when exposed

 to strong sources.

   --Constant Source of Radiation. The necessity of a constant source of

radiation for comparative pieasurements and tests was recognised at a
ON SOLAE EADIATION.                       39

very early period in the experiments. The first attempt at a constant

source was an Argand burner with a very delicate pressure regulator, a

given area of the brightest part of the flame being selected as the source.

This proved to be a very good method of testing the variations in the

quality of the gas, but had to be abandoned as a constant source of radia-

tion. It was also objectionable on account of the difficulty of keeping

the glass chimney uniformly clean, and because the excessive amount of

heat generated disturbed the experimental conditions, and the gas fumes

had the effect of tarnishing the contacts of the electrical apparatus and
Athe metallic plates used as reflectors.
                                          pair of one hundred candle-

power focus-lamps were then obtained from the Ediswan Company.

These were designed to work on a pressure of 90 volts at an efficiency

of about 3-6 watts per candle, and a current of 4 amperes. They were

spherical in form and silvered on one half, which had the effect of nearly

doubling the radiating power for a given current, while at the same time

it ensured an almost perfect constancy in the proportion of radiation

reflected from the rear of the source, which had proved a difficulty with

the Argand bui-ner. When used as constant sources of radiation the

lamps were worked at a pressure of only 75 volts and a current of

about three amperes, supplied l)y a large storage battery of forty-four

cells. The battery was not used for any other purpose while the experi-

ments were in progress, and was capable of maintaining the required

pressure constant to a tenth of a volt for several hours under suitable

conditions of charge. The pressure on the lamps was regulated and

recorded during the experiments by means of an automatic recording

potentiometer working on a scale of one inch to the volt. The readings

of this instrument were adjusted by means of a Clark cell, and were

accurate to about one part in 5,000. One of the focus-lamps was set

apart as a standard, and was used only for occasional comparisons. When

working at a voltage so far below that for which they were designed,

the lamps were found to remain exceedingly constant. In the course of

six months' work the lamp in regular use did not vary with respect to

the standard by more than one per cent., and its variations over short

periods could easily have been controlled and corrected if the accuracy

so far attained in the radiation measurements had made the application

of such a correction desirable. The area of the incandescent grid was

about one square inch, and the diameter of the bulb four and a half inches.

The lamp was set to shine through an aperture of its own diameter in a

double tin-plate screen, so as to include the whole of the radiation from

the heated glass, but to exclude as far as possible radiation from the base

of the lamp and heated objects in its immediate neighbourhood. This

precaution was particularly important in comparing the indications of the

tube form of radio-calorimeter with those to the bolometric sunshine

recpiver intended for the direct exposure of solar radiation, as the latter

instrument was not provided with a screen and diaphragms for excluding

lateral radiation, but was intended to integrate the vertical component

of the whole radiation from the sky as well as that from the sun.

  --Determination of the Initial Rate of Heating of the Disc. To ensure

uniformity of temperature of the disc, and a sufficiently slow rate of heating,

it was found necessary to replace the original disc by a much thicker disc

the size of which was chosen to be just sufficient to catch the whole of the

rays incident on the aperture. Before commencing an observation, the

reading of the galvanometer was observed with the slider at the zero o£

the bridge-wii-e in order to allow for any minute residual difference o£
temperature between the cube and the disc when the apparatus was
screened from radiation. The time of exposure was recorded on an
electric chronograph by the dropping of the screen on a suitable key.
The sliding contact was then shifted to successive points on the bridge-

wire, and the moment of balance at each point was observed and recorded

on the chronograph. These observations were continued for about five
minutes, or as long as the rise continued sufficiently rapid. Occasional

observations were then made to determine the final steady difference of

temperature B° during the next fifteen minutes, after which the tempera-

ture remained steady.
     The following is a sample of observations taken with the copper-cube :

at different distances and different rates of heating, that the equations
already given did not satisfactorily represent the observations. In con-

sidering the possible sources of constant error inherent in the method, it
seemed unlikely that the assumption that the rate of loss of heat was
proportional to the difference of temperature (q constant) could be
seriously in error, as the whole difference of temperature did not exceed

one or two degrees. The most probable explanation of the discrepancy
appeared to be that time was required for the uniform distribution of
heat through the disc, and that the indications of the thermo-junction
were retarded by conduction of heat along the wires, and by lag in the
movement of the galvanometer coil, which was necessarily very dead-beat
when shoi't-circuited on the couple. These various sources of error could
all be approximately represented by assuming a constant time-lag in the
readings ; a type of error which was necessarily inherent in the method,
and could not have been detected by the experiments recorded in 1896.
In order to eliminate the time-lag from the equations, it is only necessary
to take two observations in addition to the final steady temperature. If
we write the equations in the form (3) already given, and take the differ-
ence, we thus obtain

q{t"-t')=2-3026\og^,{6°-6')/{d°-6")  .                          . (4)

Treating the observations already given in this manner we find

q=-OlUO. r=-01232. I=-00.518. Time-lag=6-15 sees.

With only three observations it is of course always possible to calculate

a value of the lag to satisfy the readings exactly, but it appeared that a

.similar assumption satisfied the observations withui the probable limits

of error in those cases also in which a larger number of readings were

taken.

  --Defects of the Copper-cube Actiiiometer. The excessive value of the

time-lag observed in the observations with this apparatus appeared to be

partly due to the impossibility of securing uniform illumination of the
disc by the aperture method. It was necessary that the disc should be
large enough to catch the whole of the radiation passing througli the
aperture in the cube, and this could not l)e secured without leaving a con-
siderable margin at the edge of the disc which was either not illuminated

at all, or only partly illuminated by the penumbra of the aperture. With
the lamp at 00 cms. it was necessary to use a disc 1"40 cm. in diameter
for an aperture of I'OO cm. diameter. This was the more necessary because
the construction of the apparatus, and the method of screwing in the copper
plug by which the disc was supported, made it extremely difficult to centre
the disc accurately, and to direct it so as to receive the rays normally and
centrally. Another serious defect to which allusion has already been
made, was the variation of temperature of the cube and the copper plug,
which although greatly reduced was not entirely eliminated by the cotton-
wool wrappings. For these and other reasons it was decided to design a
new form of actinometer for the application of the same method in a
manner more convenient for laboratory use.

   --Tuhe-form of Radio-calorimeter. The terms ' actinometer,' ' bolo-

 meter,' and ' radio-micrometer,' which are otherwise suitable for instru-
 ments of this class, have acquired special significations, and are in general
 use for instruments which are not designed for absolute measurements,
                                                               --

42 REPORT-- 1900.

It appears therefore preferable to use the more general term ' radio-
calorimeter ' for this particular instrument, as it was not intended, like
the ' pyrheliometers ' of Pouillet or Angstrom, for the direct measurement
of solar radiation. The tube form of radio-calorimeter consists of a pair
of concentric tubes about nine inches long separated by an annular space
of about a twentieth of an inch, through which water is caused to circulate
in a spiral fashion by a helix of copper wire nearly fitting the space
between the tubes. The inner tube has a diameter of about one inch, and
is furnished with a series of sliding copper diaphragms, which can be set
at suitable points to screen off any lateral radiation, and prevent internal
reflection from the walls of the tube. The blackened copper disc for
receiving and measuring the radiation is supported near the centre of tlie
tube by means of the fine wires of the thermo-couple. The diameter of

the disc is 1-30 cm., and it is set close behind a diaphragm of 14 mm.

diameter, so that the whole of its surface is exposed to the radiation. In
this arrangement the quantity of radiation measured is determined solely
by the diameter of the disc and not by that of the apertures. The disc
can be accurately centred and directed on the source of radiation by
looking through a small hole at the back of the tube. The cold junctions

of the thermo-couples are contained in fine copper tubes soldered to a
sliding tube which carries the disc, and is a good fit for the inner tube of

the water-jacket. Water at the temperature of the laboratory is con-
tinuously pumped by a small motor from one large copper tank to another
at a higher level, and flows back continuously and uniformly through the
water-jacket of the radio -calorimeter. By this means the temperature of
the jacket is maintained very constant Avithout the necessity of making

the instrument itself massive or unwieldy.

  --Observations with, different Coatings on the Disc. With this apparatus

it was possible to obtain much more consistent results owing to the

greater steadiness of the experimental conditions and the greater ease of

adjustment and manipulation. Among other tests, some comparative

measurements were made of the relative efficiency of different coatings
of black for the disc, of which the following may be taken as samples :

     1. Copper disc clean but not polished. Final excess 1-223° C,

<7=-00512, r= -00626, 1= -00379.

2. Copper colour just visible through a thin film of smoke-black.

Final excess 2-528° C. (7=-00595, r=-01505, I=-00910.

3. Copper disc covered with thick opaque film of smoke-black. Final

4. Copper disc covered with dead-black varnish of shellac and smoke-

black. Final excess 2-159° C. ^=-00703, 7-=-001517, I=-00918.

5. Same disc, but with new thermo-couple, thick smoke-film. Final

excess 2-328° C. »7=-00642, r=-0]494, I=-00904.

6. Same disc and couple, but thin black varnish ; back also covered.

Final excess 1-831° C. g=-00812, r=-01487, I=-00900.

     It will be observed in the above results that the final excess tempera-
ture {rjq) and the coefficient of cooling, q, vary considerably under differ-
ent conditions, but that the results for the rate of heating, r, and the

intensity of radiation, q, agree fairly well for the different coatings of

black. The same focus-lamp was used as a source in each case, at the
same distance, and it is probable that the actual variations in the inten-

sity of the radiatiori did not exceed one part in 500. The voltage on the

lamp was kept within less than a tenth of a volt of 75*0 volts by the

automatic recording potentiometer, and the observations were taken

within a few days of each other. In case 1, with the clean metal surface,
the value of the coefficient of cooling g=-00512 is nearly that due to

convection and conduction alone, as the radiative power of clean metal

is very small at these low temperatures, although the absorptive power

Anfor the lamp radiation is nearly 40 per cent.  extremely thin coating

of smoke-black (2) suffices to raise tho absorptive power for the lamp

radiation nearly to its maximum, although the radiative power for rays

of great wave length is still very low, as shown by the small value of

(y= -00595, and the high value of the final excess of temperature

)-/^=2-528° C. The thicker coating of smoke-black (3) lowei's the value
of the final excess to 2'373° C, because the coefficient of cooling is in-
creased in a much greater ratio than the absorptive power for the lamp

radiation. It appears from the great increase of q, in case (4), that the

dead-black varnish is a much more efficient radiator at low temperatures
than the smoke-black, although the absorptive power for the lamp radia-

tion is l)ut slightly increased. The back of the disc was not covered in

these experiments in order to obtain a greater rise of temperature. In

case (5), with a new thermo-couple, the diminution in the values of r and
I, as compared with case (3), may be due simply to unavoidable errors of

observation, or slight variations in the uniformity of the wires, or in the

quality of the smoke-film ; but it may also be caused by a variation in the

cooling of the junctions by conduction, due to slight differences in the

attachment of the wires to the disc. In any case it is satisfactory to find

that so large a change in the conditions produces a change of less than

one per cent, in the result. Similarly, in case (6), the effect of blacking
the back of the disc is to produce a very marked increase in the
coefficient of cooling ; but although the rate of cooling by radiation is

--nearly twice as great as in case (5) supposing that the conduction and
--convection effects remain the same as in case (1) the diminution in tho

result for I, as compared with (4), is not greater than might reasonably
be attributed to the thinness of the varnish, which possessed appreciable

reflecting power.

It is clear from the above summary that the method is capable of

giving fairly consistent results in spite of wide variations in the experi-

mental conditions. But it is evidently necessary to investigate further

the absorptive powers of different coatings for radiations of different

qualities if it is desired to obtain an order of accuracy higher than one

per cent, in the absolute results. Another correction of some importance

is that for the cooling of the junction by conduction along the wires.
This correction depends on the size of the wires and on their mode of

attachment to the disc. Although enormously reduced by the adoption
of very fine wires for the couple, it remains distinctly appreciable and

requires further investigation. It is evidently possible to determine this

correction by employing wires of different sizes simultaneously, or the

whole correction may be included in the coefficient of cooling by a suit-

able arrangement of the junction.

  --Measurement of Solar Radiation. Owing to the great intensity and

incessant variations of solar radiation, it would not be possible to obtain

absolute measurements directly by exposure of the instrument above

described to direct sunshine, although such a course has been attempted

with instruments of the class of Pouillet's pyrheliometer. Even with the
--44 KEPORT 1900.

 water-jacket, the conditions of cooling are disturbed l)y the excessive

intensity of the radiation, and the final excess of temperature is much too

large to permit of the application of the elementary theory of the method.
For these and other reasons it appeared preferable to employ the automatic
 recording instruments already described ' for direct exposure to sunshine,
 and to calibrate the receivers in absolute measure by exposure to the
 radiation of the focus lamps, which could be satisfactorily determined by
 the absolute method.

   --Bolometric Sunshine Receivers. These instruments are intended for

recording on an arbitrary scale the vertical component of the radiation
from the whole sky as well as the sun. This vertical component measures
the heat received by the soil, and is probably the factor which chiefly
influences the meteorological conditions at any part of the earth's surface,
so far as they depend on radiation. It is comparatively useless for this
purpose to record merely the normal intensity of solar radiation, as the
heat actually received by the earth's surface depends so greatly on the
altitude of the sun and the state of the sky. It is proved by actual
experiment with these receivers, although it is by no means obvious
a priori, and will perhaps scarcely be credited at the first statement, that

the heat received by reflection from the sky under certain conditions may

amount to more than 40 per cent, of the whole vertical component. This
lieing the case, the readings of an instrument which records only the
normal intensity of direct sunshine, excluding the radiation from the sky,
might give a very incorrect account of the total quantity of heat received
by the soil. The form of bolometric receiver adapted for recording the
vertical component consists of a difierential pair of flat platinum ther-
mometers, one blackened and the other bright, placed side by side in the
same horizontal plane. The difference of temperature between the two,
which is automatically recorded, is approximately a measure of the
intensity of the vertical component of the radiation to which they are
exposed. It would of course be possible, by providing the instrument
with a water-jacketed tube and an equatoi'ial mounting, to make it record
the normal intensity of direct sunshine, excluding the greater part of the
radiation from the sky ; but this would complicate the apparatus consider-
ably, and it is doubtful whether the record would have so direct a bearing
on meteorology. It is also certain that the coefficient of cooling by con-
vection would vary at different angles of inclination, whereas it appears to
be very constant in the horizontal position.

    Two of the bolometric receivers above described have already been

compared with the radio- calorimeter by means of the focus-lamps. They
were of slightly different patterns, and wound with wire of diflferent sizes,
six mils and four mils respectively, but they showed nearly the same
difference of temperature when exposed to the same radiation at the same
distance. This seems to show that the indications of such instruments
are fairly comparable, even if they are not precisely alike. As we have
already seen, the absorptive powers of different kinds of black do not
appear to differ very much for this kind of radiation. The proportionality
of the difference of temperature to the intensity of radiation was also
tested by varying the distance from the lamp, and assuming that the
radiation followed the law of the inverse square. This is very approxi-
mately true for the focus-lamps, owing to the flatness of the radiating

grid, provided that the distance is not too small. It is intended in the
bourse of the ensuing year to continue the absolute measurements, and to
test the performance of the automatic recorders under a greater variety of

conditions, for which Mr. Wilson, of Daramona Observatory, has promised
his assistance ; but enough has already been accomplished to show that the
apparatus affords a very promising and practical method of recording and
reducing to absolute measure the vertical intensity of radiation at any

point of the earth's surface.

      to the Besirahility of securing Uniformity in the Size of the Pages of

A LARGE number of journals were measured to find what dimensions it

would be best to choose as standards. An account of this work was

published in the Report for 189-5, p. 77.
     Since that date a large volume of correspondence has been carried on

with the English and foreign scientific societies.
     In most cases the societies' publications come within the limits speci-

fied in the first report.

     In some of the cases the societies agreed to alter their publications so
as to come within the standard limits.

     In a few cases the societies prefer to continue the use of abnormal

dimensions rather than alter their publications, especially when the pub-
lication has been going on for many years.

     The importance of beginning a paper on the right-hand page is
generally realised, but there are difficulties in carrying it out. In spite

of this, a few of the societies are endeavouring to arrange that all
important papers shall begin on the right-hand page.

     The Committee do not ask for reappointment.

--Meteorological Ohservations of Ben Nevis. Report of the Committee,

     consisting of 'Lovi\.WLk-R-E^, Professor A. Crum Brown (Secretary),

      Sir John MuRray, Professor Copeland, and Dr. Alexander
      BtCHAN. (Drawn up by Dr. Buchan.)

The Committee was appointed as in past years for the purpose of
 co-operating with the Scottish Meteorological Society in making meteoro-
logical observations at the two Ben Nevis Observatories.

     The hour'ly eye observations made by night as Well as by day, which
are a specialty of the High Level Observatory, have been made with
complete regularity throughout the year by Mr. Rankin and his assistants.

     The health of the staff at the High Level Observatory continued good,
and the laborious work of the observations has been carried on without
the loss of an hour's observations. The Directors desire to express their
hearty thanks to Messrs. T. Affleck, George Ednie, M.A., J. S. Begg, M.A.,
G. A. S. Tait, R. C. Marshall, and T. Kilgour for the invaluable service
they rendered as volunteer observers during the summer of 1899, thus
affording to the members of the staff the relief and rest they so much
needed. Owing to the war in South Africa some changes took place in
the Observatory staff. In October J. Bell, reservist, was called out for
service, and subsequently R. M. McDougall and D. Grant left to join the
forces. At the Lov/ Level Observatory at Fort William influenza of an
acute form for a second time prevailed. But it is gratifying to add that no
observations have been lost, and the arrears of copying and computations
which necessarily occurred are being gradually worked off.

     The observations at the intermediate station at Ben Nevis were

undertaken, single-handed, by Mr. D. W. Wilton. These valuable

observations, together with the similar observations made at this station

during the previous three summers, are being discussed under the superin-
tendence of Mr. Omond.

     The principal results of the observations of 1899 are detailed in

Table I.

     This table shows for 1899 the mean monthly and extreme pressure and
temperature, amounts of rainfall with the number of days of rain and the
days on which the amount equalled or exceeded one inch ; the hours of
·sunshine, the mean percentage of cloud, the mean velocity of the wind in
miles per hour at the top of the mountain, and the mean rainband at both
observatories. The mean barometric pressures at Fort William are
reduced to 32^ and sea level, but those at the Ben Nevis Observatory

only to 32°.

    At Fort William the mean atmosj^heric pressure for the year was
29-871 inches, being 0'027 inch greater than the mean of the forty years
ending 1895. The mean at the top was 25-321 inches, being 0-025 inch

above the average of the observation since the opening of the Observatory
in 1883. The difference for the two observatoi'ies was thus 4-550 inches,

lieing all but identical with the difference of previous years. At the top

of the mountain the absolutely highest pressure for the year was 26-058
inches, and at Fort William 30-728 inches, both readings occurring on
November 17.

     The differences from the mean monthly barometric pressure much

exceeded the averages in June, July, and August, the excess for the
three months for Fort William being 0-172 inch, and for Ben Nevis

0-160 inch. On the other hand, for January and April the deficiencies

from the averages were 0-161 inch and 0'160 inch for Fort William, and
for Ben Nevis 0-164 inch and 0-165. In the summer months, when pres-
sure was abnormally high, the type of weather was anticyclonic, but in
January and April, when pressure was unusually low, the type of weather

was cyclonic.
     The deviations of the mean temperature of the months from their

--respective averages are shown in Table II. :

the average, at tlie neighbouring surrounding stations near sea level the

rainfall was about 10 per cent, under the average. It will be observed

that the large excess on Ben Nevis was almost wholly occasioned by the

extraordinarily heavy rainfall there in November and March. In these

months there prevailed over Scotland an unusual excess of south-westerly

winds. The largest monthly rainfall, 32-48 inch, occurred in November,

when south-westerly winds prevailed eight days more than the average,

and the mean temperature of the month over Scotland was 46°"4, or 5° 8

above the average of the month, an excess of south-westerly winds and of

mean temperature hitherto unparalleled for November. The heaviest

rainfall on any single day was 4"68 inches in December. At Fort

William the annual rainfall was 74"58 inches, and the largest monthly

amount was 13-27 inches in November, when the rain-bringing south-

westerly winds were so prevalent. The heaviest fall on any single day

was 1-63 inch in March.

At the top of Ben Nevis rain fell on 253 days, and at Fort William

on 223 days. At the top the monthly maximum was 28 days in September,

and the minimum 11 days in February, and at Fort William the

maximum was 26 days in September, and the minimum 12 in August.

During the year the number of days on which 1 inch of rain or more

fell was 66 at the top and 12 at Fort William, the former being 18 above

the average and the latter 5 below it.

    Much time has been taken up in revising the proof-sheets of the

hourly observations of the Ben Nevis Observatories now in the press, and

the work of printing is proceeding at a fairly satisfactory rate. It need

scarcely be added that the revision of the work, which will fill three large

quarto volumes, is peculiarly heavy. The work of reduction and entering

on daily sheets the hourly observations of the two observatories is practi-

cally brought down to date. The daily maps of rainfall, fog, storms, and

other weather phenomena are also completed to date ; and for several
selected months there are already entered on the same maps the details

for storms, forecasts, and storm warnings. With these are compared the

hourly observations at the two observatories with the view of arriving at

some definite knowledge of the relations existing among the phenomena

observed. Particular attention is given in the first place to the relations

between the double set of observations made at Ben Nevis and the fore-

casts and warnings issued from the Meteorological Office in London of

storms, rain, fog, and other weather phenomena.

For several months Mr. Omond had under discussion all hourly tem-

peratures observed at Fort William and the top of the mountain, showing
METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON BEN NEVIS,  51

a difference between the two temperatures distinctly less than the usual
difference, together with all cases where the temperature at the top ex-
ceeded that at Fort William at the time. It will be readily recognised
that this work is largely an inquiry into the anticyclone, and its connec-
tions with the cyclone and weather changes which accompany their

changing relations.

      Dr. Buchan's time has been largely occupied with the discussion of
the fogs observed at the Scottish lighthouses night and day from 1889 to
1899. These data, as stated, arc all entered on two daily maps, to each
of wliich are attached the weather maps of the Meteorological Office for the
day in question as issued in the weekly maps of the office, in addition to
which the daily direction and force of the wind at eleven selected light-
houses are given. Thus the general character of each day's weather is
readily seen, and the direction of the wind at the time the fogs were
recorded. The fogs here examined are not land fogs, but sea fogs, a
correct knowledge of which is of paramount importance to navigation.

  --The more important results arrived at are these : The annual maxi-

mum period is from April to June, and the minimum from October to

February, being thus generally the reverse of land fogs. The worst and
longest continued fogs occur with easterly winds, and their occurrence is

restricted to the east coast of Scotland. On the other hand, the fogs on
the west coast accompany westerly winds. These are much more frequent

and prolonged at places directly open to the Atlantic than at places such
as Rothesay, Oban, and Stornoway, which are sheltered from the Atlantic
by land of a greater or less extent and height.

     Conjoined with this discussion is the excessively heavy rain brought
by the easterly winds on the east coast of Scotland, and to a. greater or
less extent inland according to the height to which these rain-bringing

easterly winds extend in the atmosphere. On this point the conjoined
observations of the two Ben Nevis Observatories contribute invaluable

knowledge.

    An examination of daily weather maps of Europe constructed from

the daily weather maps of the British Islands, France, and Germany makes
it clear that these heavy rains and easterly winds occur when baro-
metric pressure dimiziishes from the Baltic and westwards through the
North Sea to the West of Scotland. It is here particularly to be noted
that at the same time humidities are high over those parts of the Con-
tinent whence these easterly winds have come prior to their arrival in
Scotland. Of these rain storms the great rains in the east of Scotland
on April 27 to 30, 1898, and on August 22, 1900, are among the most

remarkable ; they are therefore being investigated in great fulness of

detail.

     It will be known, from your Committee's previous reports, that gales

and storms of wind have for many years been observed night and day at

the Scottish lighthouses with a fulness and an accuracy attempted

nowhere else. Much time has been given to the discussion of these obser-

vations in their relations to the other weather phenomena charted on the

--daily weather maps. One of the results already arrived at and it is an
--important one is that the first step to be taken in any investigation of

storms is the partition of Scotland into eight or ten divisions based on
the physical features of the country in their relations to the more promi-
nent storm-bringing winds. The inquiry is therefore proceeding on

these lines.

                                                                                           B2

     If a meteorologist knows the distribution of barometric pressure over
Western Europe, he can then at once state what the weather is in each
part of the countries for which he has this information, and he can de-
hicribe the weather in fuhiess of detail just according to the accuracy and
abundance of the barometric readings supplied to him. This valuable

practical result is a direct consequence of the scientific study of the rela-
tions of barometer, temperature, and wind as observed over the whole
world and interpreted in accordance with physical laws.

    Now this is not forecasting, but only the description of the weather at

the time the barometric readings were taken. But it necessarily follows
that if the forecaster can guess what the distribution of Isarometric pres-
sure will be at some future time, he can state what' the weather will be at
that time. Hence the whole problem of forecasting resolves itself into
foreseeing the arrangement of barometric pressure in the future. The

distribution of pressure does not shift arbitrarily, but the areas of high
and low pressure existing on any one day change into those of the next

by movement over the surface of the earth and by increase or diminution

in intensity, in accordance with physical laws.
     The scientific study of the causes of the movements of these areas of

high and low pressure, called respectively anticyclones and cyclones, can
only be said to be just beginning. Until this great inquiry has made
some substantial progress we cannot have a science of forecasting, as we
now have a science of climatological meteorology.

     These areas of low and high pressures are not mere surface pheno-
mena, but extend upwards through the atmosphere, and their movements
are largely determined by the conditions surrounding them in the upper

regions of the atmosphere.

     Towards the expenses of publishing the hourly observations of the two
Ben Nevis Observatories the Royal Society of London has made a grant
of 5001., and a grant to the same amount has been made by the Royal
Society of Edinburgh. These societies thus approve of the publication as
a necessary preliminary to the scientific study of forecasting. The Ben
Nevis Observatories have already largely contributed to the fundamental
data of meteorology, and in the future the observations they supply will
take a promment place in the development of scientific forecasting.

    Your Committee have the greatest pleasure in adding that at the
meeting of the Scottish Meteorological Society in March last J. Mackay
Bernard, Esq., of Dunsinnan, intimated a third handsome donation of

500^. towards the maintenance of the observatories to the end of next
year. Another gentleman, on learning that assistants were urgently

required to assist Dr. Buchan and Mr. Omond in the oSice, at once readily

and most generously intimated a donation of 300^. to the Council of the

Society for the purpose.

DuEiNG the year the resistance coils and other apparatus belonging to
the Committee have been removed to Richmond. Most of the apparatus

has been set up in an outbuilding attached to the Kew Observatory, which

has been fitted by the Committee of the National Physical Laboratory as
a temporary laboratory.

      It is interesting to note that tlie case containing the original coils of

the Association bears the words, ' To be deposited at Kew.' After many

wanderings the coils have at last returned to their home.
     The Sub-Committee on Platinvim Thermometry held a meeting in the

spring, and agreed to the following resolutions :

     (i) That a particular sample of platinum wire be selected, and platinum
thermometers be constructed therefrom to serve as standards for the
measurement of high temperature.

     (ii) That Mr. Glazebrook and Professor Callendar be requested to
consider the details of the selection of wires and construction of ther-
mometers for the abuve purpose, and to consult with Mr. Matthey, who

kindly consented to give his assistance.

     Since tiien Mr. Matthey has supplied the Sub-Committee with two
specimens of very pure platinum. Portions of these have been made into
tliermometers and tested at the National Physical Laboratory, with the
following results, R^ being the resistance at 0^ and R,oo at 100°, while

The question of the selection of a wire for the construction of the

standards is still under the consideration of the Committee.

During the summer a very full comparison has been made of the unit

resistance coils of the Association, and the opportunity has been taken of

comparing these with some coils belonging to the Board of Trade, and

with others which have recently been obtained from the E.eichsanstalt.

The coils were also compared with one of the mercury resistance tubes

prepared by M. Benoit in 1885, and which has been in the care of the

Secretary since that date.

The results have not yet been completely worked out, and publication

is, therefore, necessarily deferred. Moreover, the temperature during

July was very high, so that the mean temperature of the observations is

much above that at which previous comparisons have been made. For

the purpose, therefore, of connecting these results with the past it will be

desirable to make some further observations in the autumn.

It seemed desirable to set up some mercury resistance tubes in

England, with a view of keeping a check on the variations of the wire

standards.

APreparations have been made for this.      number of selected tubes of

' verre dur ' have been obtained, with the kind assistance of the officials

of the Bureau International, from M. Baudin, while other tubes of Jena

glass have been procured from Schott & Co. Steps ai'e being taken to

have some of the best of these calibrated.

Some advance has been made during the year with the construction

of the Ampere balance. The Committee greatly regret the serious illness

of Prof. J. V. Jones, which has prevented more rapid progress. The

stand for raising and lowering the outer coils has been completed.

Thanks to the generosity of Sir A. Noble, the cost of this, estimated at

about 1001., has been saved the Committee.

During the spring the Secretary, as Director of the National Physical

Laboratory, visited the Bureau International at Paris and the Reichs-

anstalt at Berlin. The Committee are glad to put on record their

appreciation of the great courtesy and kindness with which lie was

received by President Kohlrausch, M. Benoit, and the other officials con-

nected with those institutions.

     The Committee are informed that at the recent International Electrical

Congress at Paris the two following resolutions wei-e unanimously adopted

--by Section I, and confirmed by the Congress and by the Chamber of

Government Delegates :

1. The Section recommends the adoption of the name of Gauss for

the C.G.S. unit of magnetic field.

     2. The Section recommends the adoption of the name of Maxwell for

the C.G.S. unit of magnetic flux.
     The question of giving names to the units of magnetic force and flux

has been before the Committee on several occasions. The Committee
therefore were in a position to welcome cordially these resolutions, and at
their last meeting agreed unanimously to a resolution adopting the two
names selected by the Paris Congress.

     Of the sum of 251. voted last year, 13/. 7s. 7d. has been expended on
material for the new platinum thermometers and on the transport of the ap-
paratus from Liverpool to Richmond. If the plan of constructing standards

for platinum thermometers is adopted, it will be necessary to purchase a

large stock of suitable Avire, the whole of which should be made at the
same time. For this a considei'able expenditure will be required ; there

will also be incidental expenses connected with the making and standard-
ising of the thermometers. For these purposes the Committee ask for a

grant of 75Z.

     The Committee therefore recommend that they be reappointed, with
a grant of 751., and that Lord Rayleigh be Chairman and Mr. E,. T. Glaze-

brook Secretary.

^ote on an Improved Standard Resistance Coil.

             By Robert S. Whipple.

     The coil in question consists of a bare wire wound on a mica frame.

     This form of coil possesses the following advantage over the ordinary

--resistance coil : (1) The coils can be annealed to a dull red heat in situ,

thus relieving the wire of any strain caused by the winding. (2) The
heating of a wire immersed in oil is less than one silk-covered and
varnished. (3) The temperature of the wire can be accurately determined
by means of a thermometer placed in the oil surrounding the wire.
German physicists have adopted a form of coil in which the wire is
silk-covered and varnished and then placed in a metal case perforated
with holes. The whole coil is placed in an oil bath when in use. This
form of coil is open to the objection that it cannot be annealed above
140° C. without causing injury to the silk covering on the wire, and there
is a certain amount of lag in the oil obtaining the temperature of the

coil.

    By request of the Electrical Standards Department of the Board of

Trade the Scientific Instrument Co., Cambridge, have designed and
made two standard 1 -ohm coils the wires of which are bare and immersed
in oil ; a modification suggested by Mr. Horace Darwin was also fitted
for obtaining the temperature of the coils. The coils proper consist of

0'035 in. PtAg wire wound on mica frames, the ends of the wires being

Aattached to stout copper terminals in the usual manner. 0'08 in. platinum

wire is wound alternately with the platinum-silver wire, and is attached

similarly to stout copper leads. Both coils are adjusted to a resistance

of 1 ohm at 15°'5 C. Owing to the diflei-ence in the temperature coefficient
of the two wires (PtAg 0-00024, Pt 0-00350), a small change in the

temperatui-e of the coil causes a comparatively large difierence between
the resistances of the two coils. This difference being known, the
temperatures in degrees Centigrade is given by the adjoined table. The

table is calculated from the difference in the temperature coefficients of
the two wires 0-00350-0-00024=0-00326 for 1° C.

     As the temperature coefficient of platinum is about iifteen timeS
as great aa that of platinum-silver, the resistance of this coil may be

measured to one significant figure less than the standard coil without
affecting the value for the temperature of this coil. In measuring small

resistances the determination of the last figure to O-QOOOl ohm requires

considerable care, and the advantage of not being compelled to measure
to such a high degree of accuracy is apparent. The two wires being

wound on the same frame alternately with each other and immersed in

oil are at the same mean temperature. Any temperature gradient in the

oil influences both wires similarly, thus doing away with the necessity of
a stirrer. The platinum wire is also useful for testing the insulation of
the windings of the PtAg coil one from the other. The coils are placed

in a glass vessel in order that the behaviour of the insulating oil with

time may be studied.

--PltotograpMc Meteorologt/. Tentlu Report of the Committee, consisting

    of Professor E. Meldola, Mr. A. W. Clayden (Secretary) . Mr. J.

     iloPKlNSON, and Mr. H. N. Dickson. {Brawn up liy the

        Secretarij.)

The Committee have suffered a severe loss during the past year by the

death of the Chairman, Mr. G. J . Symons, F.R.S., whose genial presence

and energetic support will be greatly missed from many scientific societies,

and especially from those which are interested in meteorology. This is not
the place to attempt any adequate eulogium of his life's work, which,
indeed, is too well known to need description.

     The observational work in progress was brought to an abrupt end

early in October. On visiting the ground where the cameras stood in
order to make some measurements it was found that the connecting wire

between the two stations had been blown down by a heavy gale a few
days before. The poles were snapped in two, several of the insulators
broken, and the connections to the cameras damaged.

     It was felt that it was not worth while to re- erect the line on the
same site, as the number of observations already made was rather more
than 400, and also because the site had become much less convenient.

    It was on some waste ground belonging to the L. & S. W. R. Co.,
near their engine sheds. At first this was very little disturbed, but for

the last two years railway operations have been encroaching on the space,

a preliminary process being the deposit of great quantities of rubbish.

     Attempts were made to find another suitable site, but none seemed
available within a convenient distance, and the expense of re-erecting the
line and repairing the apparatas would be considerable and not worth

incurring unless frequent observations were possible.
     It seemed, therefore, that the best course would be to summarise the

results so far attained and suspend measurements until a favourable
opportunity should occur.

     So far the total number of measurements made is 423. These include
no measurements of the variety of cloud known as nimbus and very few

of true stratus, the great majority being of cirrus, cirro-stratus, cirro-
cumulus, alto-cumulus, and alto-stratus.

ox PHOTOGRAPHIC METEOROLOGY,      5?

     The following tables show a comparison between the Exeter measure^
ments and those made at Blue Hill and Upsala respectively :
58 REPORT-- 1900.

     In comparing the mean values a similar remark holds good, the greater
values at Exeter being due to a small number of extreme observations.

     The minimum altitudes recorded at Exeter compare fairly well with

the others, some of the ditfereuces being most probably due to nomenclature.
     Several series of observations have been made in a single day with the

object of determining the rise or fall of clouds. It is clear from these
that on an average day the cloud planes rise steadily until the early

afternoon, between 2 and 3 p.m., when the maximum for the day is

usually reached. This is followed by a fall, which gets more and more
rapid towards sunset. In calm weather, or weather with only a moderate
breeze and no great barometric disturbance, this diurnal rise and fall is
very clearly marked ; but in broken weather, with strong winds, showers,

or barometi'ic changes, it may be completely masked.
     Cumulus is the result of an upward movement, but cirro-cumulus and

alto-cumulus may sometimes be the result of a descending movement, in
which case the lumpy form is never persistent, but passes into a stratiform

cloud very quickly.

     True cirrus of the whispy form is described by some meteorologists as
due to a rapid ascending current, by others to an equally rapid descent.

The measurements made indicate that this form of cloud may exist with
an upward or a downward movement, or with no recognisable movement

at all.

     The greatest altitudes have been found with thunderstorm conditions,
the lowest (excepting fog) with cyclonic.

     The measurements compared in the foregoing tables have all been
made between April and October inclusive. In the winter months the
ground has generally been too wet for use, and the figures from the
foreign stations are for the summer months only. It seems difficult at
first to see why the altitudes should, on the whole, be greater at Exeter,
the greater humidity of the air leading rather to the expectation of more
easy cloud production, and therefore lower altitudes. But the fact of
thunderstorm conditions being attended, as they seem always to be
attended, by great cloud altitudes suggests another explanation. This is
that vapour in a cloud-producing quantity exists to a greater height
above Devonshire. It will be noticed that the greater altitudes are true
only of the higher clouds, and that the mean level of the base plane of
cumulus and cumulo-nimbus is actually lower at Exeter than at either

of the other stations.

     The photographs collected some years ago by the Committee have
been placed in the care of the Royal Meteorological Society, with the
exception of prints from the negatives belonging to the Secretary, who
will add them as opportunity offers.

     During the past year the Secretary has made a number of experiments
with the Ives and Joly processes for photography in natural colours, but
has found that, although either process can be made to record the colour

of a cloud, the tints of a sunset, or even the colours of the rainbow, the
reproduction of the colours is so far from being an automatic process that
neither method promises to be of very great meteorological value except in
the hands of experts.

          I. On Seism,ological Stations abroad and in Great Britain.

In addition to the twenty-three stations referred to in the Report for
1899 instruments have been ordered for the Observatory, Melbourne,
the Observatory, Sydney, N.S.W., for Ceylon, for the Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, the Liverpool Observatory, Bidston, and the
Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. The total number of similar installa-

tions which may be expected to be in working order before the end of
the current year will therefore be twenty-nine. The positions of these
are shown on the map (Plate II.).

cutta, Madras, Bombay, San Fernando (Spain), Cairo, Mauritius, Batavia,
Cape of Good Hope, and Tokio, have been printed and issued as a circular
to all co-operating statious, to those who have assisted this committee in
their work, and to persons expressing a wish to possess the same. With
the object of finding permanent quarters at which a central observing
station might be established in England, at the suggestion of this Com-
mittee its Secretary, in company with Mr. Horace Darwin, visited the
Office of Works, the Treasury, and the Admiralty, and, with Major

Leonard Darwin, the Horse Guards. Many sites were discussed, and

through the kindness of Colonel Hildebrand, R.E., and commanding
officers of the Royal Engineers facilities were given to visit forts and
other buildings at Chatham, Folkestone, Porchester, and in the Isle of
Wight,

   A report on these visits and on those to other places, together with a

reference to steps generally which have been taken to find the required
site, has been drawn up for the Council of the British Association.

     In consequence of the generosity of Mr. M. H. Gray, an instrument
room is now being built at Shide.

II. Analyses of Large Earthquakes recorded in \%^'d. By John Milne.

                              1. Nature and Object of these Analyses.

     In 1S97 the Seisraological Investigation Committee of the British
Association issued to the directors of observatories and other persons in
various parts of the world a circular in which they called attention to the
desirability of observing earthquake waves which had travelled great
distances. It was pointed out that similar instruments should be used at
all stations, and the type recommended as being simple to work, and one
that yielded results sufficiently accurate for the main objects in view, was
described by the Committee in a report (see Reports of the British
Association, 1897, p. 137 et seq.).

     The result of this appeal is that instruments have been forwarded to

--the following twenty-six stations : Shide, Kew, Toronto, Victoria, B.C.,

San Fernando (Spain), Madras, Bombay, Calcutta, Mauritius, Cairo, Cape
of Good Hope, Tokio, Batavia, Arequipa, Swarthmore College (Phila-

delphia), Cordova (Argentina), New Zealand (two instruments). Paisley,

Mexico, Beyrut, Honolulu, Trinidad, Melbourne, Sydney, Johns Hopkins

University (Baltimore).
     For the year 1899 registers were received from the first thirteen of

these stations. With the exception of those relating to Toronto and
Victoria, these have been communicated to observers by the (Jonnnittee

as a circular. This circular is independent of the present report, but
continuous with registers contained in corresponding reports subsequent
to 1895.

   A glance at these registers, or tables based upon them (see pp. 80-87),

shows that while certain earthquakes have evidently shaken the whole
surface of our globe, and have probably disturbed the .same throughout its
mass, there are others of less intensity which have only affected certain
parts of the same. For example, one set of earthquakes were only
recorded at stations in Western Europe, whilst another set were appa-
rently confined to the Indian Ocean. In the following paper the earth-
c;i ]uakes referred to are only those which were recorded in England, from
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  Gl

which it follows that although the largest earthquakes of the year 1899

are discussed many earthquakes which are comparatively smaller have

been omitted.
     The object of the discussion is to indicate by examples some of the

directions in which this extensive system of earthquake observation is
increasing our knowledge of dynamical phenomena inherent to the world

on which we live.

   --The plan of the discussion is as follows : First, those earthquakes

which have been I'ecorded at the greatest number of stations, and which
have Icnoivn origins, ha\e been selected from the others and analysed
separately. To contirm tlie results towards which these analyses point,
references have been made to the more trustworthy records obtained by
similar instruments in previous years. The principal objects in view have
been as follows. The determination of the velocities with which various
types of earth vibrations are propagated and the duration of preliminary
tremors at varying distances from origins ; to show that earthquake
repetition and echoes are fairly frequent and to point out the existence
of phenomena for which satisfactory explanations are as yet wanting. In
connection with these investigations references are made to hypotheses

relating to the physical condition of the interior of our earth.

     Second, the results obtained by the above analyses are used as a
means to determine the foci of disturbances not included in the first
section of this paper. These foci, which for the most part are sub-oceanic,
in some instances indicate localities where it would be unwise to lay cables,
and where we may exjject to find configurations differing from those shown

ujjon our physical maps.

     Remembering that very many of the earthquakes discussed represent
initial disturbances which were followed by many after-shocks, the map

depicting these foci shows the regions on the surface of the earth where
in the year 1899 seismic activity was most pronounced.

                                    2. Velocities of Earthquake Waves.

     The knowledge hitherto at our disposal respecting the velocity of trans-
mission of earthquake motion over long paths has been based on records
obtained from instruments differing in type and sensibility, all of which
were installed in Europe. The result of this has been that, although the

registers led to the determination of average velocities along paths of
varying lengths, they never gave actual velocity from point to point. It

was seen that along paths from 10° to 90° the velocity of transmission of
the preliminary tremors increased rapidly with the lengths of these paths,
whilst the average velocity for large waves increased but slightly. With

regard to the former my own analyses of heterogeneous materials led to

the conclusion that, if the preliminary tremors travelled along paths
approximating to chords through the earth, then the average velocity of

transmission to a distant station was practically dependent on the square
root of the average depth of the chord connecting that station and the
earthquake centre. This furnished Dr. C. G. Knott with the hypothesis
that the square of the velocity of these particular vibrations, which were
in all probability compressional, was a linear function of the depth. With
this assumption, and with a given initial velocity, the rate of transmission
at any point within the earth could be determined and wave fronts
dtawn ; and by acceptihg a law respecting the increase of density within
--62 REPORT 1900,

our earth the elasticity governiiig the transmission of condensational

waves could be determined. The following notes show that, although the
first conclusion and the consequent hypothesis do not require modification,
constants necessary in farther calculations require to be modified.

    With regard to the large waves my own assumption was that their

apparent increase in velocity with distance might be due to the fact that
it was only large waves which, travelling faster than small waves, reached

great distances.

     The observations brought together in this paper show that this idea
has to be abandoned, and in its place we are to accept either the hypothesis
of a surface wave which increases its velocity in regions 90° from the focus,
or of a distortional wave passing through the earth the outcrop of which

"ives rise to similar surface undulations.

                                                   3. Sources of Error.

     The phases of earthquake motion here considered are the first pre-
liminary tremors and the first group of large waves, which latter in a
seismogram representing an earthquake which lias originated at a great

distance uoually correspond to the maximum movement.

      Altliough near to the origin of an earthquake there is a varying
interval of several seconds between the first movements and the shock or
shocks, it is the time of occurrence of this latter phase which is taken as

the datum to which observations made at great distances from origins are
referred. The initial time for all large earthquakes has been a matter of
inference. It may be deduced from the times at which clocks have been
stopped, or which have been noted with varying degrees of accui-acy by
survivors in an epifocal district, but more generally it has been deduced
from automatic time determinations outside such an area, and subtracting
from the same an interval which the shock is assumed to have taken to
travel from its origin to the point or points where these chronographic
records have been made. The determination of this interval is based
upon repeated observations of earthquake velocities made between stations
well removed from an epicentre and well outside a meizoseismal area.

These figures are important, not only for this particular purpose, but also

for completing velocity curves which may represent transmission over the

surface and through the material of the whole globe. They have been
arrived at by many observers, the last being those given by Dr. F. Omori,
who for paths commencing 100 kms. from an origin and extending to
distances of 1,000 kms. gives the velocities of 2-2 km. for preliminary
tremors and 1*7 km. for large waves, and within these limits the former
outrace the latter at the constant rate of 15 seconds per 100 kms.

    When we remember that large earthquakes may sometimes originate

as practically simultaneous displacements over very lai'ge areas, it is seen

that the application of the method here considered might easily result in
determinations of initial times from a few to some sixty seconds earlier
than had really been the case. Errors of this nature would result in a

 general lowering of the determinations for true velocity of transmission
 of earthquake motion to distant stations, the deviation from the truth

being most marked for the preliminaiy tremors, and in records referring
 to transmission to stations comparatively near to an origin.

      Another serious error afli"ecting the determination of initial time arises
 from the difiiculty in accurately locating the position of a focus, especially
when this is sub-oceanic.
                                                                                                              --

                                                             ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.                  63

     The assuruptioii that for large earthquakes, at least, the origin has
been at an epicentre rather than in a region at a certain depth below the

surface, is, so far as velocity determinations are concerned, of but small
importance. Although all stations have similar instruments, the recot-ds

from one or two of them indicate that their adjustment has not been
similar to that adopted at the remaining stations. Not only should each
instrument have a period of 15 seconds, but when its boom is deflected
7 or 8 mm. from its normal position, and then set free, it should take
7 or 8 minutes before returning to rest. If this latter condition has not

been observed, an instrument may not respond to the first preliminary
tremors, with the result that tJie time recorded for the commencement of
a given earthquake may be registered as one or two minutes after the

true time.

     Although errors of this order may aftect the results deduced from
observations within 20° of an earthquake origin, when we deal with paths

of greater length, and especially with large waves, the errors in the final

results are practically inappreciable.

     Another assumption made in connection with velocity determinations
is that the group of vibrations and waves as recorded at a distant station
extending between the first preliminary tremor and the first maximum

--which may extend over any interval up to 100 minutes were all the

result of the principal movement or movements at the origin ; or, in other
words, they have the same initial times. To this assumption I do not
know of any serious objection. The fact that pronounced phases of move-
ment near to an origin are not only extended in time as they radiate, but
are also more or less equalised in their amplitude, frequently renders the

 determination of corresponding points in seismograms obtained at different
stations more or less uncertain. This source of error is sometimes serious.

                                                             4. Preliminm'y Tremors.

In the compilation of the following table the only seismograms used

are those which show a distinct commencement. Each earthquake is

indicated by its British Association Register number, and the locality

from which it originated. Following this are the initial letters (see p. 88)
of the station or stations at which it was observed. The figures following

these initial letters give the number of minutes taken by the preliminary

tremors to reach these stations, and the number of degrees between the

stations and the earthquake origins. These figures are respectively placed

in positions corresponding to the numex'ators and denominators of fractions.

If an initial letter is followed by a zero for a numerator, this indicates

that all other time intervals are measured relatively to the observa-

tion made at the station represented by the initial letter.

     The fewness of these records chiefly arises from these facts : first,
they only refer to earthquakes with a known origin ; secondly, the
seismograms of small earthquakes recorded at distant stations do not

show the preliminary tremors corresponding to those given by large

earthquakes                                                  and lastly, in  consequence of  air tremors and  other causes,
                                                          ;

the earlier vibrations have in many instances been eclipsed or lost. Their

chief merit is that they give for several earthquakes records from point

to point, and that we have for the first time records relating to paths

which practically extend from an origin to its antipodes.

    When these observations are plotted on squared paper it is found

that they practically lie on the straight line referring to large waves in
fig. 1, indicating that this form of movement passes from its origin to
its antipodes with a constant arcual velocity of 3 km. per second. If,
however, the direction of propagation has been along a diameter, the
average velocity becomes 1'9 km. per second. The time taken for an
earthquake to travel from its origin to its antipodes, whether it does so as

a surface wave or as a mass wave, is about 110 minutes.

     One modification to this general statement respecting a constant
velocity rests on the fact that repeated observations made within ten
degrees of an earthquake origin have shown that the large wave velocity

within that region is about 1 S km. per second. Whatever the conditions
may be which give rise to this increase in velocity in a wave as it radiates

from its origin, it seems probable that the converse would take place as it

approached its antipodes, while the maximum velocity should be sought

for in the equatorial or quadrantal ' region of the earthquake's transit.

Inasmuch as curves drawn for the Alaskan and Ceram earthquakes show

that between 70° and 110° from their respective origins velocities may
reach 4 km. per second, and that many earthquakes indicate an increased

average velocity as their paths increase up to 110° in their lengths, there

are strong reasons for suspecting that the suggested phenomena may

exist. The comparatively small initial velocity and the slightly increased
quadrantal velocity above the average arcual velocity are indicated in
fig. 1 by dotted lines ; but whether this modification can be retained
remains to be determined by further observations. That the average
arcual velocity between O"* and 90^ is practically 3 km. per second finds
confirmation in the records for earthquakes Nos. 36, S3, 100, 119, and
193, originating in Japan, 133 and 134, originating near Borneo, and
105, from N.E. India, all of which were recorded by the same instrument

in the Isle of Wight.

          6. Interval betioeen the First Tremor and the Maximum Motion,

     In the British Association Reports for 1898, pp. 221-224, I dis-
cussed a table showing the duration of preliminary tremors or the interval
in time between the first tremor and the commencement of the large wave

phase of motion at difierent distances from a number of known origins.
One object of the discussion was to establish a working rule enabling an

observer to determine from the inspection of a single seismogram the
distance of an origin from the station at which such a record had been
obtained. Inasmuch as the table was to a great extent based upon
descriptions of records obtained from different types of instruments which
had difierent degrees of sensibility, the results obtained could not be
expected to be more than approximately correct. The following table,
which gives the time in minutes by which the first tremor has outraced

the maximum movement over paths of varying lengths, is based on
measurements made on seismograms obtained from similar instruments.

These intervals not only enable us to correct the working rule indicated
above, but, as it will be shown, they enable us to check the accuracy of
the curves relating to the arcual velocity of preliminary tremors and

lar^og^e waves.

coming round the surface of the world in opposite directions. Further, the
repetition at a given station as a reflection of a disturbance at the antipodal
point of its origin might occur at an interval of time after the first move-
ment not very different from that separatmg the two surface trains.

     Such a possibility indicates that seismic repetitions cannot be ex-
clusively used to support the hypothesis of surface radiation. Examples
of earthquake recurrences are given in the following table. The tirst
column gives the numbers of the earthquakes in the British Association

registers and their origins. Where the position of an origin is not
known from observations made in its vicinity its latitude and longitude

are determined by one of the methods described in the succeeding sections
of this report (see pp. 79-80). Such determinations must only be re-
garded as approximations. The second column gives the arcual degree-
distances of the origins from the observing stations referred to in the
third column by their initial letters. In this third column there is also

noted the number of minutes' interval between the maximum motion and

its apparent repetition. The fourth column gives the calculated distance
of the observing station from the origin, and the nearness to which it
approximates to the corresponding figures in the second column is evi-
dently an indication of the value of these observations in determining
seismic foci. The basis for these calculations is that a surface-wave
travels 180 degrees in 105 minutes. In the last column the letters G, I,

and B (good, indifferent, and bad) indicate that the determinations in the

fourth column lie within 10°, 20°, or more than 20° from those in the
second column, which latter figures, however, it must be remembered, are
themselves but approximations.
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  69

    We have here twenty-four determinations, out of which thirteen are

considered as being good, four as indifferent, and seven as bad. The three

bad determinations for earthquake No. 337 may be explained by the
assumption that we have here been dealing with markings due to second-

ary shocks which simulated seismic repetitions, a view that is strengthened

when we refer to the seismograms of this earthquake. It must also be
noted that No. 337 was less than Nos. 333 or 338, from which it may bn

inferred that the original impulse was not sufficiently great to give rise to

duplications. The fact that the Cape of Good Hope records for 309 and
338 are bad may arise from the circumstance that this station was within a
comparatively short distance of the antipodes of these shocks, and there-
fore any wave coming from that point would be eclipsed in the records of
the main disturbance. The remaining two bad determinations may be
explained in the same manner that those for No. 337 have been explained.

     The Victorian record for No. 333 is of particular interest as indicating

that the time taken for an earthquake to travel round the world or to
traverse two diameters slightly exceeds 210 minutes.

    When considering whether these repetitions are to be regarded as

surface waves or as mass waves reflected from an antipodes, a feature not
to be overlooked is their smallness. To illustrate this I here give a table

for the thirteen good observations showing the amplitudes in millimetres

of the primary disturbances and those of their repetitions, together with

the arcual distance each may be supposed to have travelled.
   --70 REPORT 1900.

      plotted as curves it is seen that each has the same general character.

     The rate at which amplitude at first decreases is about '2 mm. per

      degree of travel. Earthquakes like Nos. 343 and 347 from whatever

     may have been their amplitude in the epifocal district, are reduced
     to an amplitude of 4 mm. after about 50° of travel. Larger earth-

      quakes, like Nos. 337, 344, and 345, travelled 80° or 90° before their
      amplitude sank to this quantity ; whilst the largest of all, Nos. 333 and 338,

     show an amplitude of more than 4 mm. after travelling nearly halfway
     round the world. From an amplitude of 4 or 5 mm. the rate of decrease

      becomes less and less. For example, the amplitude of No. 337 between

     77° and 105° falls from 5 mm. to 3 mm., or at the rate of "07 mm. per

      degree ; whilst from 105° to 165° the rate at which amplitude decreases

      has been "01 mm. per degree at travel.

cannot, however, be so regarded. Between these extremely large rein-
forcements it must not be overlooked that there are others of less magni-
tude separated by intervals of from two to four minutes.

     All that we can conclude from an inspection of the above table is

that after all sensible motion of a large earthquake has ceased horizontal
pendulums, whether they are situated near to its origin or at a great
distance from the same, indicate that the earth waves at intervals of from
two to six minutes show marked increments in amplitude. The earth-
quake does not die out gradually, but by surgings. In its latter stages,

for intervals of one or two minutes, the ground may be entirely at rest,
after which movement recommences. This alternation of rest and move-
ment may be repeated many times.

     If it can be admitted that large earthquakes result from the collapse
of ill-supported portions of the earth's crust upon a more or less plastic

layer beneath, it may be imagined that rest is attained by a series of more

or less regular surgings, which are propagated to distant places to disturb

horizontal pendulums in the way observed,

                                     11. The Nature of Large Waves.

    To explain the existence of the large waves of earthquakes we are
at present left to choose between two hypotheses. One is that the

large waves of earthquakes are disturbances travelling partly under the
influence of gravity over the surface of our earth, and the latter that they
represent the outcrop of distortional waves passing through its mass.

     Near to the origin of a large earthquake earth waves are visible ; some
distance away their existence has been inferred from the wave-like motion
seen on the tops of forests, at a distance of 300 miles, and even at very
much greater distances the feeling occasioned by the moving ground is
similar to that which is felt upon a raft moved by an ocean swell.
Bracket seismographs, hanging pictures and lamps, water in vessels, ponds,
and even in lakes, do not move with their natural periods, but are clearly
influenced by a forced tilting. Finally, even as far as the antipodes of an
origin, the character of motion assumed by horizontal and other pendulums
shows that this is due to slow but repeated changes in the inclination of

their supporting foundations.

     If we except the movements observed within the epifocal area, all the
other movements are as explicable by the assumption of the outcrop of
mass waves as they are by the assumption of surface radiation.

      The explanation that these waves have an increased velocity in their

quadrantal region (assuming such to be the case) may perhaps rest on the
fact that we are not dealing with radiation in uniformly widening rings,
as would be the case over a plane surface. The condition in this region

is such that energy is transferred from ring to ring, the diameters of which
 are but little different from each other. Radiation from a pole to its

antipodes over a spherical surface may be likened to that of a wave which

 runs along a channel, which expands for half its length and then contracts.
      The phenomena which give the greatest support to the idea of surface

 radiation are, first, the existence of earthquake recurrences or waves which
 have travelled from an origin to a distant station in opposite directions
 round the world, the one arriving last having its amplitude reduced to
 expected dimensions ; and second, the observations which show that waves

tude as those which have been propagated over the beds of deep oceans.

Were the large waves of earthquakes mass waves, it is assumed that the

damping effect of oceanic waters would be insignificant.

    When considering the large waves to be distortional mass waves, an

observation of importance is that they travel from their origin to their

antipodes in about 110 minutes (see fig. 1). If the path was along a

diameter, the average velocity of propagation must therefore have been

1'9 km. per second, which is ^practically the so-called initial velocity. The

close correspondence of these two velocities suggests the idea that there

has not been any symmetrical change in the velocity of propagation of

waves through the earth with regard to its centre, or, in other words, the

large waves have had a diametral velocity which is practically constant.

This idea of a constant velocity for all depths indicates that arcual and

Andiametral velocities should be equal, which is not the case.  escape

from the dilemma is to suppose that the large waves do not pass through

the earth, but round its surface.

                        12. Criticisms and Analyses by Dr. C. G. Knott.

     In reference to the conclusion implied in the last paragraph. Dr. Knott
remarks that it does not necessarily follow from the premises, the initial
speed referred to being an arcual speed, or a speed for short distances

from an origin through the surface layers. When a disturbance travels

straight down it very soon gets probably into more homogeneous materials
beneath the crust. It may therefore be a mere coincidence that the
average speed along a diameter may come out almost exactly the same as

the arcual speed in the crust.

     The evidence seems to show that once you get into the nucleus proper,
the speed of the large waves decreases with depth. But this does not
prevent the speed suffering a distinct increase when the disturbance passes
from the lower layei's of the crust into the higher layers of the nucleus.
That the arcual speed should be 1"9 for small arcs, and then become on
the average three when the arc is half a circumference, seems to be an
immeasurably more difficult thing to understand than that the speed
downwards should first increase and then decrease as the depth increases.

A not improbable change in the nature of the material could easily

account for the latter vai'iation ; but it is dithcult to see how a surface
wave of the size of the large waves could gain in speed as it ran round the

earth.

     Writing more generally respecting the propagation of large waves,
Dr. Knott says :

    I have looked pretty carefully into your numbers and curves, and now
I shall indicate some of my conclusions. As you have pointed out, the

one doubtful point is the precise instant at which the disturbance began,
also to some extent the exact position of the origin. I take your deter-
minations as being as accurate as they can be obtained, and proceed to
consider the speeds indicated. The accompanying tables will show you
what I have tried to do. Take the Alaskan group, the most complete of

all you have. It is gratifying to find how similar the results are for the
three different earthquakes. The greatest discrepancy is in the two
numbers for the Batavian records. It is curious that these time records
do not fit well into the general scheme. Can there be any mistake 1 The
arcual speed indicated is distinctly smaller than we find in all the other
                  ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.                             75

cases, except the case of Mauritius. If there is no mistake in calculating

the times, then the disturbance travels comparatively slowly along the

Alaskan Batavian route. This route, if it lies near the si(,rface, is almost
wholly beneath the deeps of the North Pacific. But then, on the other

hand, the Alaskan Mauritius route is also a comparatively slow route,

and it lies further to the west, under Siberia, India, and the Indian

Ocean. Still, these two routes are in the same quarter of the

globe, so that a similar value for the speed is not unlikely. It may
be not merely a question as to whether sea or land is overhead, but may

depend on the general character of the rocky material. These two routes

left out of accouiit, there is a very striking constancy in the value of the

arcual speed calculated for these various routes. In the four routes to

Shide, San Fernando, Bombay, and Cape of Good Hope, the great circles

pass all very near the poles. It is beautiful to see how well these four

polar routes agree, With the somewhat scanty material you have to

hand, I doubt if you would be at all warranted in making any deductions

as to variations of speed. The Alaskan results suggest a constant value

for the arcual speed. The same constancy is indicated in the Mexican

earthquakes, but the value comes out distinctly smaller than in the Alaskan

Whyquakes.       is this 1. Still thinking of great-circle routes, we see that

there cannot be much difference between the Mexican Batavian and the

polar routes from Alaska, unless, of course, the former goes pi'eferably by

way of the South Pole. But that possibility is not considered in calcu-

lating the speeds. If we took it that way the speed would come out

larger  in  the  ratio  of  210  to  150 or  7       giving  1-9  instead of  1*4,  a

remarkable coincidence truly. The Mauritius number will also be

increased in much the same ratio. But what are we to make of the

others ? No, I think we must get at an explanation of the much smaller

speeds associated with the Mexican earthquakes in some other way. Is

it possible that the depth of the seismic focus might have something to

do with it ? Have you any facts to guide you to an estimate of the

probable depth ?

    And now pass on to the Ceram quake. Here the constancy, so marked

a feature in the other cases, no longer holds. There is an undoubted in-
crease in the arcual speed over the longer arcs. The most striking feature

is the smallness of the Mauritius route speed as compared with that

associated with the Cape of Good Hope route ; for there cannot be much
difference in the routes for the greater part of the way. But did not

Mauritius give a too small value in the Alaskan earthquake also 1 Again,
I ask, is there no possibility of an error in the time estimate 1 Ceram
Victoria and Mexico Batavia give approximately the same value for the

--arcual speed a point which tells in favour of the accuracy of the time

estimates, for the routes are very different in the two cases. Leaving out

of account all but the broad features, we may conclude that the speeds

(arcual) associated with the Alaskan are distinctly greater than those
associated with the Mexican and Ceram earthquakes- But I confess I

can give no satisfactory explanation of this, nor can I see why Batavia

and Mauritius should give smaller values than the others in the Alaskan

group, and why Cape of Good Hope and Shide should give comparatively
large values in the Ceram group.

    And now let us see what comes of taking the chord as the approximate
path of shortest time. Interpreted in this way the results indicate that
the waves must go diametrically through the earth at a much slower average
76 REPORT-- 1900.

rate than along a course near the surface. Thus, from the Alaskan group

we should infer an average diametrial speed of about 2-2 km. per sec.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

                                                 ;

2*5. This suggests that the speed of propagation along a diameter de-

pends upon the particular diameter considered-^a very curious result

surely, unless, of course, the depth of the focus below the surface be very

different in the different cases.

As regards the general question of the diminution of speed at greater

depths, all we can say is that it is not impossible. True, the result is un-

expected, seeing that there can be little doubt that the preliminary tremors

travel quicker at the greater depths. But then it is also certain that the

elastic constants involved in the transmission of the two types of waves must

be essentially different, and there is no necessity for them to obey similar

laws of variation with depth. In my ' Scottish Geographical Magazine '

article I pointed out that the bulk modulus might increase at a much

quicker rate than the density, whereas the rigidity might increase at much

the same rate. To meet the new need we have merely to assume that the

Werigidity does not increase so quickly as the density.             know that the

density increases with the depth, and we know nothing whatever about

the elastic constants except what we learn from seismic phenomena. It

was, in fact, with feelings of surprise that we first recognised the high

speeds of earthquake disturbances through the body of the earth. That

another type of wave should travel more slowly at the greater depths

should not therefore be matter of any surprise, although certainly re-

markable.

The hypothesis that the large waves really pass along brachistochronic

paths seems to require that the speed diminishes with distance from the

centre. This means that the paths are convex outwards, concave towards

the centre. Hence the paths to points within 90° of the origin will tend

to follow more or less closely the arc of the outer crust. When the arcual

distance exceeds the quadrant, then the paths begin to pass through deeper

parts of the earth, and the fall off in the value of the average speed be-

comes more apparent. This is precisely what is indicated in the values

deduced from the Alaskan group, since it is not till the arc exceeds 105°

that the value of the calculated average speed shows marked diminution.

The Mexican group shows the same feature, but not so the Ceram earth-

quake. Still it is only one against five, and we shall be safer in following

the five.

Comparing the two hypotheses, the surface wave and the brachisto-

chronic path, we see that up to distances of a quadrant or so they give
much the same result, because the brachistochronic path is largely con-

fined to the surface layers. As regards greater distances the evidence in

hand is not very clear. Increased ' arcual speed ' is hinted at, and this,
if it exist, is a serious stumbling-block in the way of accepting the surface

wave theory. But at best the increase is small, and, except in the case of

the Ceram quake, really too small to build any conclusions upon. I should

rather be inclined to say that the evidence so far is in favour of a practi-

cally constant ' arcual speed ' over all distances. But I still entertain

strong suspicion of the possibility of surface waves of the magnitude re-

quired being transmitted over the earth's surface. If we take the values of
the arcual speeds in the Ceram earthquake as being accurate, we meet
what seems to me to be an insurmountable difficulty in the surface wave

theory. On the other hand, we have no insurmountable diflBculties if we

     The methods and considerations which have led to these determina-
tions have been as follows :

         (1). Determination of Oi'igins by Comparisons bettoeen Time Intervals,

     Earthquakes from the same district will arrive at distant observing
stations at times the differences between Avhich will be constant. If, for

example, we have once determined the difference in time at which an
earthquake originating off the coast of Japan arrives at Batavia, Bombay,
Cape of Good Hope, Shide, &,c., whenever these differences are repeated
at four or more stations, without knowing anything about observations
in Japan, we can at once say where such an earthquake has originated.

It will be noted that our knowledge respecting the speed with which earth-
quake motion is transmitted enables us to give approximate values for the
time differences here considered.

         (2). Bij the Difference in the Times at ivhich the Maximum Motion

                                    has been recorded at differerd Stations.

     In the present state of our knowledge all determinations of the position
of oi-igins from time intervals require the assumption that the velocity of
propagation of earthquake movement is constant. This condition is most
neai-ly fulfilled by the large waves of earthquakes. The methods by

which an earthquake origin may be determined from the differences

between the times at which it was recorded at distant stations are several.
The method of circles which is here employed has been selected chiefly on
account of its comparative simplicity in application. It is briefly as
follows : If the large waves of an earthquake reacli stations B, C, D, &c.,
four, ten, twenty, cfec, minutes after reaching station A, then the centre

Aof a circle which passes through and touches circles drawn round B, C,

D, &c., the radii of which are respectively 4 x 1°'6, 10 x 1°"6, 20 x 1°'6, kc,
will be the centre of the origin required. The constant l°-6 means
that the arcual velocity for large waves is taken at 1°"6 per minute, or
approximately 3 km. per second. In the British Association Report for
1899, p. 193, the speed there given was 2*5 km. per second, which appears
to be too low. The operation of drawing these circles is carried out
on a ' slate ' globe. For a complete solution observations are required
from at least four stations. With only three observations we are left to
choose between two possible centres, but as these may be widely separated
there is usually but little difficulty in selecting the one required.

(3). By the Time Intervals between the Arrival of Preliminary Tremors
                         and Maximum Movement.

From what has been said respecting preliminary tremors and large

waves it may be inferred that the interval in time between the appearance

of these two phases of earthquake motion at a given station has a relation

to the distance of that station from the origin. This relationship is shown

Anin fig. 1.  observer with this curve before him, although his time-

keeper may have failed, or although he may be so situated that it is

impossible to obtain accurate time, is immediately able to determine from

a well-defined seismogram the distance at which the motion it represents

originated. With this fact, the magnitude of his record, and a knowledge

of the physical configuration of districts from which earthquakes originate,

he is frequently able to locate an origin. With time records from several
--80 REPORT 1900.

Btationa the distances corresponding to each of them from an origin ai*e
read from tlie curve, and by the intersection of these on a globe seismic
foci are determined with greater certainty.

                (4) By the Intervals represented by Seismic Recurrences.

     Whenever a seismogram shows the interval of time between a
hiaximum movement and a distinct reinforcement of vibratrions which can-

not be accounted for as forming part of the gradually decreasing surgings
following the principal disturbance, this interval enables us to state the
distance of the origin from the station at which the seismogram was
obtained. Opportunities to apply this method are not frequent

(see p. 68).

14. The Application of the above Methods to the Records for 1899.

To carry into eflFect the method of determining origins by comparisons

of time differences, the following eleven tables have been prepared. In

these the 105 Shide records are referred to by their British Association

register number and their date. For each of these the time intervals

between the arrival of maximum motion at the station beneath which a

fcero is placed and its arrival at other stations are given in minutes.' In

those instances where the time at which an earthquake originated is

approximately known, as in Table I., the zero is placed beneath the

word ' origin.' So far as possible the various earthquakes have been

analysed according to the localities from which they originated. When

the time intervals in a series are less than three in number, the location

Aof an origin is sometimes doubtful.  dash beneath a station indicates

that an earthquake was observed, but for reasons which are various

Athe time of its maximum could not be determined.  query indicates

that an observation is uncertain.
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  81

    In very many of these entries there must be errors, the reasons for
the existence of which have already been explained. The values of these

vary between a fraction of a minute and several minutes.

    Where origins are known from observations made near to the same

these are stated.

    The geographical positions of these origins are shown in map (Plate II.).
Some of the entries on this, particularly those for the Atlantic and
Indian Ocean, are conjectural, whilst others may be taken as correct.
The reliance which can be placed upon any particular determination is

shown in the table of time intervals on which the same is founded.
     263. This earthquake, which is described in the British Association

Eeport, 1899, p. 212, and was recorded in Tokio at Oh. 59m. 29s. G.M.T.
March 7, is of interest as showing that the amplitudes of motion recorded

at Shide and Kew were greater than those recorded at Toronto, whilst at

Victoria, the nearest station to the origin, but reached by a sub-oceanic
path, it was the smallest of all (see p. 70).

     Other earthquakes, approximately corresponding to entries in the

Tokio register, and which may therefore have originated near to Japan,
are Nos. 271, 286, 314, and 363. Noa. 351 and 352 may have originated

to the east of Japan, about 40° N. lat. and 160° E. long.

' Javasclie Courant/ 1900, No. 21. He gives Amahei time for the shock

±as Ih. 42-2m., and that for Wahei as Ih. 43m. (17h. 7m. G.M.T.). At

the former place five to ten minutes after the shock, the coast was flooded
by a sea wave. This inundation, to a height of 1 '7 to 9 metres, was also

experienced at other places along the south coast of Ceram. At Banda,

187 km. .south-east from Elpapoeti Bay, the water began to rise about

half an hour after the shock. At Kawa, at the west end of Ceram, and

at other places, strips of alluvium were submei-ged. Dr. Verbeek places
the centrum a few miles inland to the west of Elpapoeti Bay, on the line
of a fault running parallel to the south coast of Ceram.

     The time intervals between the shock and the sea wave observed at
Amahei indicate an origin at a distance of -o to 1 degree from that place.
This would probably be sub-oceanic, and on the face of the Webber Deep,
where soundings have been obtained of 4,000 fathoms. As it is possible
that there may have been a bodily displacement of materials lying between
Ceram and the Webber Deep, this does not interfere with Dr. Vei'beek's
fault line. The time at the origin may therefore be taken as lying

between 17h. 7m. and 17h. 9m. If the maximum observed at Batavia
took place at 17h. 24m., and the movement took 15 minutes to reach
that place, we again reach the conclusion that the time at the origin

was about 17h. 9m. G.M.T.

     Nos. 333, 337, and 338. In the 'Toronto World 'of September 25 we
read that on September 3, about 2.30 p.m., houses in Yakuta Bay were
rocked violently, doors were slammed, dishes rattled, and tables moved.
On September 10, about eight o'clock, a more violent movement occurred.
Trees swayed, and there were slight shakes every few minutes. Just as
the earthquake ceased tidal waves came rolling in. There were three of
these waves following each other at intervals of about five minutes. The
rise was 15 feet from low tide to a foot above the highest tide point.

On the island of Ivanak, opposite Yakuta, a graveyard sank so that on

the next day a boat was able to row over the place where it had been,
and the tops of the submerged trees could be seen.

     These shocks disturbed the declinometer, duplex, and vertical force
magnetographs in Toronto.

     Scanty as these notes are, they apparently indicate an origin somewhat
to the east of that shown in Plate III.

     The period of the earth waves for No. 333 as recorded at Shide was

15 seconds, whilst the maximum angle of tilting was 8". With a velocity

of 3 km. per second, and the assumption that the motion is simple harmonic,

45 km. in length and 29 cm. in height. With periods of at first 40 and

afterwards 15 seconds for the disturbance recorded in the Isle of Wight

on September 10, No. 338, it would appear that at first there were waves

to have been very strong. It was felt over the whole republic At

Colinia, on the Pacific side, it had a duration of Im. 20s., and on the
Atlantic side, at Vera Cruz, it lasted 10s.

     By the method of circles and by the method of preliminary tremor

intervals I place the origin at a point 30° distant from Victoria, and 34°

from Toronto, or near to lat. 19° N. and 105° W. long. On January 20,

1900, 'No. 381 was recorded in Mexico with time intervals similar to
those for No. 250. The preliminary tremor intervals for this referring to

Victoria, Toronto, and Kew read 13, 15, and 38 minutes, indicating that
the Kew reading for No. 250 is the lower of the two values given.

     The time readings for 248 clearly correspond with that for an earth'
quake with a similar origin.

    294. An origin S.W. of Jamaica roughly agrees with the time differ-

ences between Toronto, Victoria, and Shide, and the preliminary tremors

duration for Kew and Toronto.

     371. In 'Nature,' April 19, 1900, we read that on December 25, at
12.25, an earthquake took place in S. California. In the villages of San
Jacinto and Hermet every brick building was damaged.

    Professor F. Stupart sends me the following extract from a newspaper

clipping :

                                                                 Los Angeles, Cal., December 25, 1899.

     The towns of San Jacinto and Hernet, in Riverside County, were
badly shaken by an earthquake at 4.25 o'clock this morning. In San
Jacinto not a brick house or block escaped injury. Nearly all of the
business portion is in ruins. The new Southern California Hospital caved

in. It was not occupied. At Hernet the Hornet's Company mill is
partly down. The front wall fell flat. The rear of the large Johnston
block also toppled over. Hernet's new hotel is a ruin. The damage at

those places cannot be estimated now. Communication by wire is inter-
rupted. The ' Herald ' has received a telegram from San Bernardino saying
that six Indians were killed at Hernet by falling walls during the earth-
quake. The Santa Fe raUroad report is to the effect that no lives were

lost.

  --Los Angeles, December 25. The total damage at San Jacinto and

Hernet is estimated at ^50,000. No person was injured at either place so

far as known. The shock was heavy at Santa Ana, Anheim, San
Bernardino, Riverside, and other places, but no particular damage is
reported except from San Jacinto and Hernet. In this city no damage
was done, though the shock was particularly violent. The houses here
are well filled with Eastern tourists, and they were in many instances
terrified at the unexpected disturbances, and rushed from their rooms.

  --San Diego, Cal., December 25. The most severe shock of earthquake

experienced in this city in fourteen years took place at 4.25 a.m. to-day,

and was accompanied by a loud rumbling noise. The taller buildings

Ain this city were severely shaken, but no serious damage was done.
Ahigh wave struck the beach ocean front, but no ^damage was done.

slight shock followed the first a few seconds later.
     268. The time intervals for Shide, Victoria, Bombay, and Toronto

suggest an origin near to that given for 322, with which the preliminary
tremors for Victoria and Mauritius accord. In the British Association
Report for 1899 this origin was placed on the western side of the

Atlantic, but additional data having since been obtained this is now

modified.

subsided from 2 to 6 feet. The railway line between Aidin and Omourlou
was raised fully one yard.

     373. From 'Nature,' January 25, 1900, we learn that the earthquakes
of December 31 destroyed many houses at Akhalkalaki (Transcaucasia).
Here and in ten neighbouring villages over 200 people perished. At the

Tiflis Physical Observatory the following observations were made. In
Greenwich mean time the first shock was at lOh. 51 ·4m. It was severe
in the hilly part of the city, on the right bank of the river Kura. The
second shock was feeble and noted at 13h. 39"5m. The third shock was
not noted by the seismograph at the observatory on the left bank of the

Kura, but was noted at 17h. 45m. on the right bank. At Kalagelan the

first was observed at lOh. 49m., and at Sviri and Zugdidi at llh. 23m.

The latter places are on the Kars Railway. At the railway stations,

Abasturaan and Kobi, the times were 13h. 51m. and llh. 2ra.

III. Earthquakes and Timekeepers at Observatories.

    That earthquakes we can feel frequently accelerate, retard, or stop

clocks with pendulums is a fact well known, but the extent to which
cryptoseismic disturbances which sweep over the whole surface of our

globe many times per year aflfect this class of timekeepers has not yet

been investigated.

    Father J. de Moidrey, S.J., of the observatory at Zikawei, gives me
the following notes on this subject. On June 12, 1897, ' an excellent clock

facing north lost 4m. 44-5s. in the afternoon, whilst another, almost
identical, fixed to the same brick pillar, but facing east, was undisturbed
(rate 0-ls.). Secchi's barograph shows a slight stroke at llh. 25m.

G.M.T., corresponding to an oscillation of 1 mm. of the quicksilver.
    'A fast moving barograph (mercury) shows a spot at llh. 2.3m., indi-

cating a swing of the mercury of 0-2-5 mm. This increased to 0'50mm.

and died out suddenly.
     ' The magnetographs, declinometer, bifilar and Lloyd's balance were

all disturbed, although it was a day of perfect magnetic calm.'

    On this day, at llh. 5m. G.M.T., a violent earthquake took place in

Assam. The large waves of this would reach Zikawei at llh. 21m. G.M.T.,

or 7h. 26m. 43s. p.m. local time.

     In a second letter Father Moidrey writes :

' On June 4, 1898, about midnight, our north clock lost about four

seconds. That same night at a watchmaker's in Shanghai several clocks

(six, I believe), all facing north or south, were stopped. Nothing else was

noticed by the watchmaker, M. Vrard, who in his surprise telephoned to

the observatory to ask what was the matter. Nobody in the town felt an

Aearthquake, nor was one referred to in the newspapers.  missionary

at Nankin had his clock stopped the same night, but did not notice any

other phenomena. Our magnetograph and thermograph recorded a shock

at 16h. 24m. 17s., June 3, G.M.T. On that day there was an earthquake

at Chemulpo, Corea.'

     We' are here evidently dealing with an earthquake recorded on June 3
at 17h. 14m. at Shide, and also recorded at Kew, Nicolaiew, and Potsdam.

     From the ' Bulletin Mensuel ' of Zikawei, third quarter, 1897, we learn
that in the night of September 2 the two clocks were stopped and the

magnetographs were disturbed at 1.42 (September 1, 17h. 36m. G.M.T.).

Nothing was felt. This may refer to an earthquake recorded at Shide,

September 1, 18h. 29m. G.M.T.

    Although Professor E. C. Pickering writes me that on September 3,

10 and 23, 1898, which are dates for heavy earthquakes in Alaska, and
on September 20, when there was a severe earthquake in Asia Minor,
there were no noticeable changes in the rates of the clocks at Harvard
106 REPORT-- 1900.

                                         ;

observatories at least the unfelt movements of earthquakes may from time

to time have serious effects on timekeepers.

With the object of throwing light upon this subject I shall esteem

it a favour if directors of observatories will let me know whether any

changes were observed or not observed in the rates of pendulum time-

keepers on dates corresponding to those of large earthquakes enumerated

on p. 108, addressing their communications to me at Shide, Isle of Wight,

England.

                                                 IV. Earthquakes and Rain.

     In the British Association Reports for 1899, p. 209, I gave a quota-
tion from Mr. O. H. Howarth respecting a heavy condensation of aqueous
vapour which he observed for three hours after the Mexican earthquake
of January 24, 1899. This was in the form of a heavy mist which settled
over the head of a canon at an elevation of 8,700 feet.

     Mr. Howarth states that in this place such mists are never seen at this

time of the year, it being the middle of the dry season.

     Something similar to this occurred on June 12, 1897, after the severe
earthquake which originated on that day in the highlands of Assam.
Mr. H. Luttman-Johnson, I.C.S., in the 'Journal' of the Society of Arts,
April 15, 1898, describes the weather before the earthquake as having
cleared : the afternoon was lovely, and there was not a cloud in the sky.
Five minutes after the earthquake the residents in Shillong were sur-
rounded with cloud and mist, and they sat up all night with rain beating
upon all sides.

Captain A. A. Howell, I.C.S., deputy-governor of the Garo Hills,

gives the actual rainfall. "The records taken at 8 a.m. showed that for
the twenty-four hours preceding the 12th there was no rain. There was
rain at noon on the 12th, but it cleared off at 2 p.m. The earthquake

occurred at about 5 p.m., and after that until next morning 3'26 inches

fell.

       In considering whether there is any possibility of a connection

between the phenomena here considered we must remember that observa-

tions showing that rain and cloud have followed closely on the heels of

certain earthquakes appear to be confined to tropical and semi-tropical

countries                                 and it is in these countries where sudden showers, indicating the
                                       ;

collapse of critical atmospheric conditions, are frequent. Given, therefore,

such conditions at no great distance above the surface of the earth, which

was probably the condition in the highlands of Assam, and then admit

that beneath the gaseous covering consisting of layers of air of different

temperatures and with different degrees of saturation 10,000 square miles

of mountainous country was moved, or that a much larger ai-ea was thrown

into violent wave-like movement, we recognise that the relationship of

earthquakes and atmospheric precipitation may not be so improbable as is

generally supposed. As the ground rose upwards, the air immediately

above it would suffer compression, and as the ground fell there would be

rarefaction, whilst layers of air differing in their physical state might be

mixed, and a vigorous seismic activity might in this way result in pre-

cipitation.

                  V. Earthquakes and Small Changes in Latitude.

     In vol. xvii. of the ' Seismological Journal of Japan,' 1893, p. 17,
I drew attention to the observation that the period of maxima increase

in latitude in Berlin apparently coincided with maxima of earthquakes

recorded in Japan.

     If we compare the wanderings of the pole from its mean position for

the years 1895-1898 ^ with registers of earthquakes which have disturbed

continental areas or the whole world, we find a somewhat similar relation-
ship. This is shown in the accompanying table, the pole displacements

being measured from Albrecht's figure.

--
108 REPORT-- 1900.

the times at which large deviations in latitude occui". In April, when

these deviations were comparatively small, large earthquakes did not

occur.

    When considering the possibility of any relationship between earth-

quakes and these extremely frequent and practically oscillatory changes
in latitude, there are two points of importance to be remembered.

     The first is that with each of these earthquakes there is a sudden
shifting of a large mass of material at a seismic origin. The molar dis-
placement for the Indian earthquake of June 12, 1897, is estimated by
Mr. R. D. Oldham by an area of 6,000 or 7,000 square miles, and it is
not improbable that earthquakes which have caused the Pacific Ocean to
oscillate for a period of twenty-four hours were accompanied by displace-
ments of larger magnitude.

     The second consideration is that each of the large earthquakes here
considered has been accompanied by surface or distortional waves
Avhich in many instances afiect the whole surface of the globe. These

waves, so far as we can infer from their velocity, period, and maximum

angle of inclination, vary between twenty and seventy miles in length,
and are from a few inched to two or three feet in height. If they attain
the magnitudes here given (see p. 83) they seem certainly sufiicient to

relieve a district in erogenic strain.

   A further test of the suggestion that slight nutational efiects may

result from earthquakes would be to compare observations indicating
small changes in latitude made before and after the times of large earth-
quakes referred to in the report, the more important of which are as

follows :
                O:^ SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.                              109'

more likely to be still in progress than is one which can only be shown
to affect Palaeozoic or Secondary rocks. Not only have the older
movements in many cases ceased long since, and have given place to move-

ments in different directions ; but a fault which has long remained without
movement tends to become closed and re-cemented, so that there is a

considerable likelihood that any future movement may not follow exactly

the same line, even though the strain be in the same direction.

3. The fault should crop out on ground fairly level, and in hard rocks,

otherwise  the  observations  may  be  masked  by  the  slight  irregular  '                               ''

                                                                              creep

of the surface downhill, and no firm foundation for the apparatus be

obtained.

     4. It is desirable that the rocks on the two sides of the fault, though

geologically far apart, should be as like as possible in lithological charac-

ter, so that any surface movements due to change of temperature or
absorption of rain-water should affect the two sides alike.

5. In order to avoid complications through slow solution of the rocks

by percolating rain, a fault bringing together insoluble silicious rocks

would be preferable to any other.

    6. As the records to be obtained may throw great light on movements

of the earth's crust, it is desirable that the fault selected for observation

should be one belonging to a set of disturbances of great magnitude,

having common characteristics, and affecting a considerable area. It is

therefore important that the district chosen should be one which has been

carefully studied geologically, and of which the structure is thoroughly

known.

     These various conditions, added to the consideration of convenience of

access of the locality, availability of a skilled observer, availability of the

land, and other minor points, made a series of requirements not easy to
satisfy, and I will now indicate in what respects the site finally selected

comes up to or falls short of the ideal set before us.

      Consideration No. 2 confines us at once to the only area in Britain in

which large earth-movements of Tertiary date can clearly be proved to

have taken place. This area may be taken to lie between the North
Downs and the English Channel, and to extend as far west as Weymouth

and Abbotsbury. But only the parts of it in which Tertiary rocks are

still preserved will do for our purpose ; the reason being that older move-
ments of the same general character affected the Jurassic and Lower
Cretaceous rocks. These intra-Cretaceous disturbances cannot always be
distinguished from the Tertiary movements, in the absence of the uncon-
formable Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary strata. Thus in the Wealden

area a good many faults are believed to affect the Lower Cretaceous rocks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but they are of no great magnitude, and it is impossible at present to
differentiate those of Tertiary date from the older series.

   We are thus confined, by a process of elimination, to the sharply folded

belt which occupies the southern part of the Hampshire Basin and
includes the northern half of the Isle of Wight. Even over this area it
would only be possible to use Mr. Horace Darwin's apparatus at certain
points ; for much of the country is sharply folded without faulting, and

any earth-movements now in progress could only be measured by careful
levelling and triangulation. Thus we are confined ultimately to a limited

highly disturbed and faulted belt, which extends east and west through
the centre of the Isle of Wight and reappears in Dorset between Studland

Bay and Abbotsbury.
110 REPORT-- 1900.

Within the area thus selected are various sharp monoclinal folds, all

with an east and west axis, and with the strata so bent as to become

nearly vertical. In places the lateral pressure and folding have been so

-violent as to pass into overthrust faulting on a considerable scale. None

·of the Tertiary disturbances in this part of England is a normal drop-

fault ; the supposed north and south Tertiary fault in the Medina valley,
though "often shown in old maps and text books, having no existence.

The date of most violent disturbance in the system of folds above

^alluded to is clearly later than Middle Oligocene ; for in the Isle of

Wight ijhe Hamstead Beds, which belong to that period, and are the

newest Tertiary strata there preserved, are tilted at a high angle. From

various considerations, which need not here be recapitulated, it seems

probable that this set of disturbances commenced in Eocene times, became

most violent in the Miocene period, and died away in Pliocene times.'

Though in our south-eastern counties older Pliocene strata to some extent

have been tilted, tlie disturbance has not yet been shown to affect newer

deposits, or to be still in progress. This last is one of the principal points

which our apparatus should decide.

Consideration No. 1 limits our choice to a small group of faults, not

more than half-a-dozen, and as the apparatus employed needs a fairly

clean-cut fracture, unless the pipes are to be of unreasonable length, it is

only at a few points on these faults that the observations can be made.

We have thus so greatly reduced the number of possible points at which

the apparatus could be fixed, that it will now be simplest to describe the

faults one by one, and point out to what extent they do or do not fulfil

the rest of the requirements.

Working from east to west, the first Tertiary fault met with is in the

main monocline of the Isle of Wight, which occasionally passes into a

thrust-fault of no great extent. In one place the basement bed of the

London Clay is brought against Bracklesham Beds                                                                                                                                                                                             but the strata are too
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

soft and full of water to yield satisfactory fixed points. In the others,

plastic Clays of the Reading Series have slid over Chalk, the bedding being

vertical and the surface slope very high. At no point in the Isle of

Wight could a satisfactory site be found.

Following this disturbed belt westward, we again meet with a sharp

monoclinal fold, passing into a slide-fault, at Ballard Cliff in Dorset.

This is the well-known ' Isle of Purbeck Fault,' which thrusts Chalk with

flints with curved bedding over similar rock with the bedding vertical.

The fault itself is very conspicuous in the cliff-face, curving through about

a tenth of a circle in a height of 280 feet.^ This fault might be a good

one for observation                                                                     but though it is of considerable magnitude, the
                                                                                     ;

locality is by no means convenient of access. The disturbance is, however,

a valuable one to study, for its character is clearly shown in the section.
The other faults with which we are now dealing apparently are all of this

type.

The next Tertiary fault met with is close to Corfe Castle, where in the

sharpest part of tlie monoclinal curve the London Clay has been thrust

over the Heading Beds and abuts against the Upper Chalk. This slide-

fault is of small magnitude, and as in similar slides in the Isle of Wight,

the ground is too steep and the rocks too soft to yield satisfactory fixed
points. Along the same line the junction of the Chalk and Eocene is

again slightly faulted near Lulworth ; but the fault is of small magnitude,

and the adjoining rocks are too much shattered for our purpose. The

Durdle fault runs parallel with and close to high cliffs, so that delicate
observations might be entirely masked by movements caused by the
gradual removal of large masses of rock by the sea on the south and the

consequent rise of the strata qn that side. At Bat's Head the Isle of

Purbeck Fault is finally lost beneath the sea, and the shattering of the

rocks is too great to allow of exact observations. This fault does not

reappear in the Weymouth area.

     There still remains one of the most important Tertiary disturbances

in the district, that known as the Ridgeway fault. This also is an over-

thrust fault cutting through a monocline, or through the north limb of a

sharp anticlinal fold. Its date is clearly later than the Bagshot period ·
its magnitude is great, and if any of the Tertiary faults are still under-

going changes, this one is likely to partake in the movement. It brings

together rocks of very different ages and of varying character, so that the

choice of exact locality for the observations depended on the discovery of
a spot where the fault is a clean fracture, whei'e the rocks on each side
are hard and of fairly similar lithological character, and where the ground
is sufficiently level for the apparatus. Along a good deal of its course

there is much fault rock or broken ground, and in most parts the strata

on one or both sides are soft. These parts would not be convenient or
satisfactory for our purpose. For various reasons the choice narrowed

down to the neighbourhood of Poxwell, where Middle or Lower Chalk
abuts against Lower Purbeck ; or to the district between Upway and
Portisham, a distance of four miles, where Upper Chalk is faulted
against strata close to the base of the Lower Purbeck, or even against
Portland Beds. Of these localities Upway was chosen (fig. 2), for there

the deep lailway-cutting has laid open the structure of the disturbance
and within a reasonable distance, though not too near, was a piece of
fairly level ground, one end of which had been opened for chalk-pits and
the other for quarries in the Purbeck Beds. The railway-cuttintr itself
would not have been satisfactory, for in it a wide dyke of ' fault-rock '
composed of Oxford Clay and Cornbrash, occurs, and south of the fault

there are soft rocks. Besides this, soft strata in a deep cuttinw will
almost certainly be subject to slow ' creep ' to such an extent as entirely

to mask any deeper-seated movement.

The site finally selected proved by an unexpected series of coincidences

to be particularly convenient. It is broken ground, now only used for

rough  pasture  and  not  liable to  be disturbed  by the  plough                          it  beloni-s

the member of the Committee who was prepared to undertake the

recording.

     While our excavations were being made I examined them, and noted

as exactly as possible the geological conditions in the immediate neigh-

bourhood, for the fault varies within very short distances, and has
changed completely in the two hundred yards between the railway
cutting and our selected site. In that short distance the dyke of Oxford

the north side of the fracture, as well as the Wealden and Upper and
Middle Purbeck on the south side. The fault has also become a fracture

of unusual sharpness for one of so great a magnitude.
     In discussing the character and extent of thrust of the fault at

Ridgeway, it should not be forgotten that it does not pass through a

series of conformable strata. The Upper Cretaceous rocks here rest
unconformably on a folded and greatly eroded surface of Lower Cretaceous
and Jurassic strata, so that the local absence of Wealden and of most of
the Purbeck may be due to this unconformity. These intra-Cretaceous
folds have an axis approximately parallel with the much later Tertiary
disturbances. The most important of them is the wide anticline between

Upway and Portland. This is followed northward by a narrow and

sharp syncline, which brings in the Wealden and Purbeck between Upton
and Bincombe, and passes unconformably under Upper Cretaceous rocks
towards the east and towards the north-north-west. Next follows an
anticline, which is almost entirely hidden by the newer rocks. It is
touched at Poxwell, where the Jurassic strata dip northward at a higher
angle than the Upper Cretaceous. It then seems to run beneath the
Chalk parallel to the southern boundary just north of the Tertiary over-

thrust. Its southern limb reappears at Bincombe, but soon disappears
again beneath the overthrust mass of Chalk. The position and character
of these earlier folds, their relation to the Upper Cretaceous overlap, and
the relation of both to the overlap of the Bagshot Beds on to the Oolite,'
are the factors which produced a continuous plane of weakness extending

obliquely downward from the surface deep into the Jurassic strata, as
shown in the diagram (fig. 3).

     The outcome of this geological structure has been that any subsequent
lateral compression in a north and south direction causes the massive
Chalk, over 800 feet thick, to be driven against the wide arch of rigid

Purbeck and Portland rocks extending towards Portland. Any such

movement must tend still more to fold and buckle the already existing
small anticlines and synclines ; but the main arch of hard Upper Jurassic
rocks would offer great resistance, as v/ould the horizontal ihick-bedded
Chalk. Thus the Chalk must approach the main anticline, overriding the
minor folds, taking with it such parts of them as happened to be above
the plane of greatest weakness, and smearing the slide-plane with Oxford
Clay and Cornbrash caught up in the passage over the northern limb of

the anticline.

     The above explanation will, I believe, account for the whole of the
curious phenomena recorded along this line of fault. Granted north and
south compression, any differential movement must be along this plane of
weakness. The extent of the differential movement must also be greatest
at the surface where the plane emerges, and must rapidly decrease down-
ward and northward until the fault entirely disappears. The extent of
the movement in this case is probably about half a mile.

     From the data in the memoirs and maps of the Geological Survey, and

from my notes made more recently, I have constructed the subjoined

geological section across the fault at the point where our apparatus is
fixed (fig. 4) ; but though the underground structure must be not unlike
that indicated, the exact curve of the fault, and also the exact character

of the hidden folds beneath the Chalk, must remain uncertain. The
Eocene deposits are not shown in this section, as they happen to have
been denuded along the line selected. They occur only a short distance
away out of the line of section. . The actual evidence seen at the surface
close to our site will now be described.

    On the south side of the fault the strata dip northward at varying

angles for a distance of about two miles from the crest of the main anti-
cline, the lowest rocks in the district occurring in this anticline north of
Radipole, where the Forest Marble appears at the surface. To this
succeed in order the Cornbrash, Oxford Clay, Coraliian Rocks, and
Kiraeridge Clay, followed at XJpway (at the south border of the map,
fig. 2), where the slope becomes steeper, by Portland Sand, Portland Stone,

and Lower Purbeck Beds. The lower quarries at Upway are in Portland

for at that point the lowest part of a synclinal fold is reached and the

strata begin to rise again.

Higher up the hill in quarry and road- cutting the sections are nearly

continuous, the dip being about S.S.W. at angles varying from 15° to 30°.

Signs of lateral compression are also common, this being particularly

well seen on the west side of the quarry nearest to the fault, where in a

few yards the dip changes from nearly horizontal, with small sharp folds,

to an angle of 15°. At the extreme north edge of this quarry the

Lower Purbeck, and occui* within a few feet of the Portland Rock. The
strike is almost parallel to the fault, though more nearly east and west.

Thus it becomes almost certain that Portland Beds crop out at the

surface immediately east of the Roman road and are probably within less

than 10 feet of the surface at the point where the recording apparatus

crosses tlie fault.

     Taking now the trench in which the apparatus is placed, we will
describe the strata there seen on each side of the fault. The trench is

9 metres long, and at the four observing stations (see Mr. Horace Darwin's

Report, p. 119) sections were exposed to a depth varying from 5^ to 7 feet.

At Station SS (the southernmost) the depth was 5^ feet, of which the top

3 feet was in disturbed ground, the lower 2^ showing hard brownish fine-
grained oolite with fossils, the rock being somewhat shattered, with small

open fissures, which Avere afterwards filled in with concrete. This rock
undoubtedly belongs to the Lower Purbeck ; it seems to dip at a high angle

in a southerly direction, the strike, however, not being parallel with the
fault. The shallower trench between Stations SS and S showed similar

strata, though no fossils or oolitic grains were observed. At Station S the

hole was also 5^ feet deep ; the rock being a hard splintery brown limestone,
more or less nodular and containing small chert nodules. I believe that this

rock corresponds with some cherty limestones which are seen in the large

Upway Quarry, just below the 'dirt-bed' and within 5 or 10 feet of the

base of the Purbecks. Near the fault, however, they are harder and
more crystalline than in the quarry. I was not able to find the earthy
and carbonaceous ' dirt-bed ' at this point, though it is so well seen only
50 or 60 feet away (see fig. 5). The squeezing-out or thickening of a soft
stratum is, however, a phenomenon constantly to be met with near a big
distux'bance, and the absence of the cai'bonaceous seam is probably due to
this cause. The south cheek of the fault consists of brecciated white

limestone with chert. These exposures seem to indicate that the Portland
Stone must occur within 5 feet or so of the surface close to the fault, and

on the strength of the new evidence I have added an inlier of Portland
rock to the map made by Mr. Strahan, Avho agrees with me that such an

addition is necessary.

     The fault itself is represented by a band of fault-rock not more than
2 feet in thickness and quite unlike the wide dyke of mingled Oolite and
Oxford Clay seen in the railway-cutting. In our trench the fault-rock is
a hard mass of breccia consisting of Upper Chalk and fragments of
Purbeck Limestone.

     The north cheek of the fault consists of very hard shattered and

re-crystallised flinty chalk like that associated with the similar disturb-

ances at Corfe Castle and at Ballard Clifi", though at Ridgeway I did not

observe actual calcite veins. Two feet north of the fault I dug out a

specimen of Anancliytes ovatus ; but this echinoderm and a few fragments

of Inoceranuis were the only fossils I could find in the Chalk in our trench.

The flinty character of the Chalk and the presence of the Anancliytes

show, however, that we have passed suddenly from Lower Purbeck to Upper

Chalk, and the character of the Chalk and of the included flints indicates, I

think, that we are at an horizon above the Micraster-zones and probably at

least 300 feet above the base of the Chalk.

   NBetween the fault and Station the Chalk gradually becomes softer

and less crystalline and contains small broken flints, black with moderate

NNrinds. The hole at Station  showed 6 feet of moderately hard Chalk,

with numerous brownish -grey flints ; the Chalk being fissured but not
NNaltered. At Station
                       the hole was 7 feet deep and exhibited Chalk

with numerous flints, the rock being much slickensided and fissured. It

contained a few fragments of Inoceramus. I was not able anywhere to

get a satisfactory dip in the Chalk in the trench or holes ; though the
general impression suggested was of an ascending succession northward,

and of a high dip in that direction.

The general results of the geological examination may thus be sum-

marised. The fault, at the point where the apparatus crosses it, probably

cuts out strata having a thickness of nearly 1,000 feet, made up thus :

                                          Total feet 985

The break, however, is not caused by a normal fault of 985 feet throw.

It is the result of a sliding movement over a cylindrical surface curving

downward and northward from nearly vertical to nearly horizontal.

This view, as pointed out by Mr. Strahan, explains the presence of a

dyke of Oxford Clay and Cornbrash     in the railway-cutting                                                                                    a fact which
                                                                                                                                             ;

cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by normal faulting, even to the

extent of 2,500 or 3,000 feet. The movement along the curve of the

thrust-plane amounts to not less than 2,500 feet, even if the strata are

everywhere vertical to the fault. It is just possible, however, that earlier

faulting along nearly the same line in intra- Cretaceous times brought up

Cornbrash, so that it occurs immediately beneath the Upper Cretaceous

rocks just north of the Tertiary fault. On this supposition, and with

the most favourable angle of dip throughout, the Tertiary thrust may not

exceed 500 feet. The most probable estimate of the extent of the

Tertiary displacement is, however, about half a mile ; a lower estimate

demands an improbable series of fortuitous coincidences, such as we are

not j ustified in postulating.

There is one point that I should like to suggest for future considera-

tion. The disturbances just described result from lateral compression of

the strata in a north and south direction, and it is clear that levelling

across the fractures will only give us one element in that motion. The

horizontal movement must be of much greater magnitude than the vertical,

and could be accurately tested by triangulation. As the folds have always

an east and west axis, and there is no sign of disturbance in other

directions, triangulation across the folds from fixed points lying east and

west ought to enable us to test whether any change is now going on over

wider areas. Even a comparison of the earlier Ordnance triangulation

of the South of England with the later one might throw light on this

Noquestion, if the stations can be identified with suflicient accuracy.

minute re-measurement of a base-line would be necessary for this test.

If the movement is going on at all it must be far greater in a north and

--south than in an east and west direction i.e., it will alter the latitude

but not the longitude. It must therefore distort every triangle which can

be re-observed from two such points as St. Catherine's Down and the top

of Portland.

VII. An atUmpt to detect and measure any relative movement of the strata

  --that may be noiv talcing place at the Ridgeway Faidt near Upivay,

    Dorsetshire. Preliminary Report by Horace Darwin, August 1900.

     The Fault for this experiment was selected by Mr. Clement Reid, and
is described by him in a separate report. It would have been better if
the rock had been harder and more impervious to water ; the solubility
of the carbonate of lime in the rock is also a disadvantage. The site is
easy of access, an essential point in such an experiment ; this, together
with the advantages pointed out by Mr. C. Reid, justify the selection of

the Fault.

     The Fault where the apparatus is fixed is a few yards east of the

Roman road and about 560 yards north of the cross roads in the village

of Upway, Dorsetshire, and is about 360 feet above Ordnance datum.
Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, allowed the apparatus to be fixed
on their property and did all in their power to make the experiment
successful, and the Committee are most grateful to them. I must thank

Mr. Nelson Richardson for the many hours' help he gave me at Upway,

and in arranging for the experiment, and for the readings he took after-
wards. Thanks are also due to Mr. Loveless, the tenant of the land,
for the care he has taken in carrying out the work and the help he gave
in every way.

     Four positions were taken in a straight line approximately at right
angles to the fault ; these positions will be denoted by the letters N.N., N.,
S., S.S. ; N.N. is 9 metres and N. 4^ metres north of the Fault, and S.S.
is 9 metres and S. 4^ metres south of it. The apparatus is arranged to
measure the relative vertical movement of the strata at these four
stations. There are advantages in selecting four instead of two stations.
If there had been only two stations, and the apparatus got damaged at
one of them, the experiment must have been a failure ; also, if there had
been any accidental displacement of the apparatus relatively to the strata
at either of the two stations it might have led to misleading results.
With four stations such damage or movement will probably be detected,
and the results, though less valuable, will not be rendered quite useless,
as would be the case with only two stations.

     The movement of the strata at the Fault may take place in any or all

of the following ways :

     (1) The strata on both sides of the Fault may tilt as a whole without

any slip taking place at the Fault.

     (2) The strata at the north side may tilt and the south side not tilt,

and still no slip at the Fault.

     (3) The strata at the south side may tilt and the north side not tilt,

and still no slip at the Fault.

     (4) There may be slipping at the Fault with no tilting.

     These four movements may be all taking place at the same time, and
the use of four stations will allow of each movement being separated from

the others.

     The apparatus has been designed by me and made by the Cambridge

Scientific Instrument Company, Limited. I have not been able to give
sufficient time this summer to overcome some difficulties which I regret
that I did not foresee, and it is for this reason that no numerical results
120 REPORT-- 1900.

are given in this report. The instrument, however, promises well, and 1

hope next year to give a description of it and numerical results ; now I

only propose to explain its general principle.

   A brass casting is permanently fixed to the rock at each of the four

stations, and it is the relative vertical movement of these castings which

Ais measured.                         stand carrying a microscope can be placed on any of

these castings ; it has three feet, each in the form of an inverted V, and

these rest on three cylindrical pieces forming part of the brass casting.

This is the usual geometrical arrangement, giving six points of contact,

and determining absolutely the relative position of the microscope stand

and the casting. The microscope is about 4 feet long, and thus the eye

is in a convenient position for taking an observation. The microscope is

moved vertically in the stand by a micrometer screw, and carries at its

lower end a needle pointing vertically downward. The micrometer

screw is turned, the microscope is lowered till the needle point touches

the surface of some oil contained in a vessel fixed to the rock, and

the position of the micrometer screw noted. The microscope and stand

are then removed and placed on the other castings, and the observation

repeated ; in this way the relative position of the casting at each station
to the oil surface is measured. The four oil vessels are connected by a

pipe                     the  surface of    the  oil  is   therefore at the                                  same level.                                           The needle
                      ;

point is illuminated by a mirror fixed in the oil vessel, and the light,

leaving it in a nearly horizontal direction, is reflected by a vertical

mirror nearly directly backwards, ajud is then again reflected vertically

upwards through the object-glass and eyepiece of the microscope. On

looking vertically downwards through the microscope, the needle point

and its reflection in the surface of the oil are seen as if the eye were

placed just above the surface of the oil ; and when the micrometer screw
is turned the needle point and its image are seen to approach each other.

The  moment of                        contact  is  perfectly    evident                                      the  needle  and                                      its  image
                                                                                                          ;

appear to run into each other in a confused manner, owing to the dis-

tortion of the oil surface when the needle point touches it. The delicacy

is considerable ; the divisions in the divided head of the micrometer screw

correspond to a movement of -j^^ mm., and it is easy to estimate a tenth

of these divisions, but I do not think that the readings can be trusted to

this amount, and it is proposed only to read to i^^ mm., which is well
within the power of the instrument.

     The micrometer readings give the height of each station above the oil

surface, and from these readings is deduced the movement at each

station relatively to a datum plane. This datum plane is taken at the
mean level of the four stations. The necessary calculations also prevent

any error arising from change of the oil level due to expansion or

evaporation, damage to the needle point, or expansion of the microscope.

     It is hoped that a very small slip at the Fault will be detected and

measured, but even if the movement should ever become as much as
10 mm. to 20 mm., it can still be measured with great accuracy. It is

unlikely that such a movement will damage the lead pipe where it crosses
the Fault ; damage to the pipe, however, can be easily remedied without

impairing the accuracy of the readings. Some readings have been taken,

but  it                  is   feared  that  they      are  not  perfectly                                    trustworthy                                           they may,

however, be useful in confirming later results.

                                            § 1. Introduction.

The term point-group is a dii^ect translation of the German word Punkt-

grujype, first used by Brill and Noether in the year 1873 in their classic

memoir on algebraic functions,' but to my knowledge, although more than

a quarter of a century has elapsed since then, there has been no very
systematic attempt to present the theory of point-groups to English

readers along any of its lines of development. And yet it should prove
of interest even to those mathematicians who do not desire to specialise
in it, for, historically and logically, it touches upon many distinct branches

of pure mathematics. To mention only those which are most directly
brought into connection with each other, we have the intersections of

plane curves, the elimination of variables from systems of equations, the

algebraic theory of correspondences on a plane curve, properties of linear
systems of plane curves, and applications of the theory of functions to

the theory of curves and surfaces in space of any number of dimen-

sions.

     As frequently happens when the progress of a subject has been due
to many different writers, the logical and the chronological divisions do

not coincide. I have therefore in view a dual arrangement of the

subject-matter. In the present instalment of my Report, I have

attempted to sketch this proposed arrangement under its two aspects,
viz- : as an historical outline (§ 2), and as an analysis according to
content (§ 3). This is followed (§ 4) by a detailed account of one of the
historical divisions. I hope in the subsequent portions of the Report to
deal in a somewhat similar way with the remaining divisions, and to
append a complete bibliography.

§ 4. Beill's Memoirs on Elimination and Algebraic Correspondences.

                                                    1863-1873.

     Brill's earliest papers in the Mathematische Annalen are on problems
which arose naturally out of the subject-matter of his Habilitations-

schrift, viz. the transformation theory of algebraic functions in connec-

tion with Riemann's memoirs on Abelian functions. Clebsch and
Gordan, in their treatise on Abelian functions, published in 1866 (the
year before Brill's Habilitationsschrift), had attempted to develop
a theory of the applications of Abelian functions to geometry. Inter-
preting Abel's and Riemann's equations as curves, they expressed
the number p, which plays a fundamental part in Riemann's theory of
Abelian integrals, in terms of the singularities of the corresponding plane
curve, thus identifying it with the number studied by Cayley under the
name of deficiency. They further discussed the persistence of this number

--under bi-rational transformation that is, the simplest type of a one-one

--correspondence and the existence of certain constants (moduli) invariant

under such transformation. Brill adopted their interpretation of the
equations, and his work, though essentially analytical in form, is capable
of direct geometrical application in its results.

     The number of the moduli is the subject of the first two papers. In
the earlier of the two ^ he remarks that Riemann, by analysis, found

     ' Math. Ann., vol. i., pp. 401-406, 1869, ' Note beziiglich der Zahl der Moduln einer
Classe von algebraischen GleichuDgen.'
124 EEPORT-- 1900.

--3 p 3 to be the number of moduli of his ' normal ' function, whereas

Cay ley ' obtained, by geometrical considerations, the number 4 ^^ -- 6 for the
+curve of (2; l)th order, the 'normal' curve of Clebsch and Gordan ; but

--by actually performing the transformation of the latter in the case /;=4
-- --into Riemann's form. Brill shows that there are in fact only 3 p 3

moduli (a result which Cayley verified later.) ^ The second paper ^ was

occasioned by a memoir by Casorati and Cremona,'' in which the trans-

formation of Clebsch and Gordan's form into Riemann's is effected, by

geometrical methods, for the cases jo=4, 5, 6. Brill obtains their results

by different methods, employing the properties of curves in space of three

=dimensions. An example for p 6is3i septic with nine double points ; this

he connects by a one-one transformation with a curve in space of the 8th

degree, quoting Cayley ^ to show that the transformation can be effected

in exactly five ways, corresponding to the five straight lines in space

which meet the tortuous curve of the 8th degree in four points. Similarly

for^^^T, the transformation of a plane curve of the 8th degree can be

effected in twenty-one different ways. These examples are important, as

forming a connecting link between the theory of transformation, in which

they presented themselves, and the theory of elimination, to which they

directly lead ; moreover, within the theory of elimination they suggest

the question of the number of different solutions satisfying a system of

simultaneous equations.

In the year 1871, Brill begins to turn his attention to a wider theory,

that of elimination when stated algebraically, or of correspondences when

stated geometrically. This is shown in the title of a paper,^ which con-

tains proof of theorems required in the succeeding paper ; '^ but neither

of these has any immediate application to our present purpose.

The geometrical side of the theory of correspondences had been

already attacked by Chasles, De Jonquieres, and Cayley, but algebraical

proofs  of  many theorems   were       still  wanting                                                  and, moreover, the  treat-
                                                                                                    ;

ment of the problems in a purely symbolical and analytical manner led

to the establishment of theorems in the general theory of elimination,

which in their turn apply to a region intimately connected with the

-- --theory of correspondences that of point-groups on a curve but at the

date we speak of, still comparatively unexplored.

In Brill's first important contribution to the theory of elimination,*'

he attacks the problem of the number of different solutions which satisfy

a system of simultaneous equations.^ He remarks that Roberts '" and

Salmon '^ confined themselves to a discussion of the degree of the

eliminant in the whole number of variables, not the degree in which

each variable appears. The latter is the more difficult pi-oblem, and

admits of complications in which the interpretation of certain equations

as correspondences is of great value (see infra, p. 129).

In this paper he finds by induction, without a rigorous proof, a

formula for the number of solutions of a system of equations in k inde-

pendent variables (each equation being symmetrical in all the variables),

+the system consisting of a number of equations equivalent to i \ inde-

meaning. When k--i--\ have been so chosen, the 'number of solutions'

means the number of +different ways in which the remaining i \ L,an be

+found to satisfy any i \ equations of the system. The number (see

formula (A), infra) is made to depend on the sums and differences of the

numbers of common solutions of pairs of systems of equations (in square

brackets in (A) below), one system of each pair being of the same kind

+as the original system, but equivalent to fewer than i l independent

equations                                        while  the                             second  system    of  the  pair  is       either  precisely one

valid reasoning in the paper under consideration, and particular cases of

the more general problem, to which formula (A) also applies [i.e. when

there are k pairs of variables, connected by k relations), are solved in

the next paper - by direct evaluation.

When the terms of the right-hand side of (A) come to be actually

evaluated, the particular case, here alone considered (i.e. of k independent

variables), proves capable of direct treatment by algebraic theorems in

elimination proved in the earlier part of the paper, and the final result is

From the point of view of the theory of point-groups, a geometri-

cal problem which Brill solves by means of formula (A) is of interest ; it

is thus stated :

+ --Given a {k i ^)-ply infinite family of curves of order m, viz. :

+a,0](x,y) a2^2(x,y)+ ;·· +f';.+i0i+i(x,y)=O. Assuming k-i-1 of the

points of intersection with a straight line, to find i others such that every
k--curve through these
                        1 also passes through a cei-tain kth point. In how

many ivays can this be done ?

Or, in other words :

    In hov) many loays can k points he chosen on a straight line, so that an

+i-ply iifinite system of curves, selected from a (k i ^)-p>ly infinite system

may pass through them ?

Since the number of solutions is all that is required, the problem is not

made less general by taking the intersections with a definite straight line,

y=0say ; substituting this value for y in the equation from the outset,

we are led to finding the number of solutions of exactly the matrix con-

sidered on p. 125, leading to formula (A), which, since a;,, . . . x,. are k

independent variables, can be directly evaluated as above.                 .

Brill's investigations into the theory of correspondences definitely

commenced in 1872.'' In the introductory remarks he attributes the

origin of this theory (in geometry) to Chasles, who, in 1864, first enun-

ciated the principle of correspondence for points on a straight line :

m' if to every point x there are n points y, and to every p)oint y tliere are
mpoints X, tlben at + n points an x coincides with ay;' and who after-

wai-ds extended it, in 1866, to points on any unicursal curve.^ Cay ley

had given 1 an extension of this principle to curves of any deficiency

«,2 without, however, formally proving it, and it is at this stage that

Brill took up the subject. He gives an algebraic proof of Cayley's formula

for the number of united points of one correspondence on a given curve of

deficiency j), and he finds, moreover, the proper extension to curves

of any deficiency of the well-known algebraic theorem : ' if betiveen the
points X, y of a straight line, there exists a relation ,p{^, y)=0 by means of
which u points x correspond to a j)oint y and X 2yoints j to a point x ; and
further, if by means of a second relation (p'(x, y)=0 k' points x correspond

to \' points y ; then the number of jmirs of jjoints lohich satisfy both
+relations is {<P<P')=kX' >:'\.' The first relation ^(a;, 2/)= is said to establish

a    correspondence (k,  X)  between  the                                        points  on     the  straight   line                 the

second, <p'{x, y)=0, a correspondence (ic', X'), and (ff) gives the number of

pairs of points which satisfy both correspondences.

     Brill's extension is as follows -.--Given a fixed point z on a curve t oj

deficiency p, and two movable points, x, y, on the same curve, and let the

two relations, (x, y,z)=0, (^'{k, y,z)=0 hold, which, regarded asfunctions

curves, selected from a given triply-infinite system, may pass throughJhein.

This is a simple case of the problem already referred to on p. l'J5 (viz.

work out the problem directly in the first place, without using formula

Also, if any two independent curves of the triplj'-infinite system can be

passed through this arbitrary point z and through certain other two x, y,
ony=0, then a singly-infinite number passes through these three points,

and they form one of the triplets whose number is required. To arrive at

two independent curves of the system, take any two fixed points A, B, in

the plane, and consider first the curve through sand A, then that through

Band;:; ; each has still one degree of freedom, but loses this and becomes

perfectly determinate if passed through a common point y on /=0. Let
Mevery curve of the triply-infinite system have
                                                        movable points of
-- Mintersection with /=0 that is to say, points whose co-ordinates depend
--on the variable parameters of the system then these two independent
Mcurves determined by y have each -- 2 points of intersection x with/=0
M --besides z and y ; and in general the
                                          2 a;'s belonging to one curve will

be all distinct from those belonging to the other ; but if y be properly

y=chosen (or, we may say, for certain positions of y on 0) an x of one curve

will coincide with an x of the other, x, y. z thus forming one of the required

triplets, since two independent curves pass through them. The expression

for certain positions ofj oni=0 introduces the idea of the movement of the

point y on/, which necessitates a corresponding movement of the two sets of '
M -- 2 .r's belonging to the two distinct curves ; we may say with reference
M --to each curve, that to every position of y there correspond
                                                                 2 positions

of X ; moreover, since, when confining the attention to the curve through
M --z and A, it is immaterial which of the
                                            1 points is called y, we say
Mthat to every position of x there correspond
                                               -- 2 positions oi y : we
-- --have a symmetrical correspondence (M 2, M. 2)heliveen the ^yoints x, j
Aestablished on f=0 by means of the C7trve through z a7id ; and, similarly,

we have another established by means of the curve through z and B.

But we have already pointed out that for certain positions of y, i.e. of the
M --one of the
                1 points which is common to both curves, there will be an

X common to them as well, and it is the number of such positions of y (or

of this x, since the relation of this particular x and y is reversible) that

we wish to find.

Again, since the original system has three degrees of freedom, the

Asystem through   (or through  B)  has  two degrees of  freedom                                   hence  one
                                                                                               ;

curve of the system can always be drawn to touch /=0 at any point on it,

and no curve can have a double point. In other words, wherever z is

taken ony=0, there is always one position of y which coincides with z (on

the curve touchingy=0 at z), or 2/=~ satisfies the correspondence equation

^ identically once. (If no curve could have been drawn to touch y=0 at

any arbitrary point, y=^z would not satisfy the correspondence equation

identically at all, whereas, if a curve with a double point at any arbitrary

point on/"=0 could have been drawn, then y=z would have satisfied the

correspondence equation identically twice, &c.) The number of times

that y'=z satisfies the correspondence equation is called the ' Wertigkeit'

of the correspondence, and is denoted by    \<f\,j-.    In symmetrical cor-

respondences, such as the one above, x, y, z are all interchangeable, and

therefore [</)]i,,= [</>].,,= [()!)],-,,._

     The value of the ' Wertigkeit ' is written as a subscript to the bracket

(i^^') ; thus, in the language of correspondences, the number of solutions

CO our present problem is the number of pairs of points which satisfy two

Mcorrespondence equations, each given as (M -- 2, -- 2)j. But from this

number must be subtracted those pairs of points which lie on that one curve

Aof the triply-infinite system which passes through both and B as well as

z, for these do not lie on two distinct curves, and therefore not on a curve
       ON THE PKESENT STATE OF THE THEORY OF POINT-GROUPS. 129

of a singly- infinite system. The number of such pairs is obviously the
M --combinations in twos of the
                                 1 points besides z, which lie on/=0, i.e.

it is  --'^ -. If, therefore, we write k^=k'^=\=z\'=M. '2 and

y=7'=l in the formula given on p. 127 for (i^^') (dividing it, however,

by 2, since our correspondences are symmetrical), and then subtract

      -- --'- from this, we obtain the number of triplets, viz. (M 2)^

p - ^(M-l)(M-2)=i(M-2)(M - ?,)-p.
    Now compare the steps of this process with the formula (A) for this

+ = -- --case, i.e. with (3 l)3 [(3);j(3)3] (3 1)3 and we see that the two cor-

respondences employed, exactly similar, were the determinants, the number
of whose solutions was denoted by (3)3, (3)3, while (3 - 1)3 gives the num-
ber of those solutions which needed to be subtracted from the total number.

     In more complicated problems, formula (A) is used at once, and the

evaluation of the number of common solutions of the equations in the
square brackets (the number and form of these equations is given above,

pp. 125 and 126) is performed by interpreting these as correspondence equa-

tions (cf. p. 124), provided we know how many points correspond to one in

each correspondence (they are always symmetrical, as is seen at once from
the form of the determinant) and also the ' Wertigkeit ' of the points

x--y, kc. (Here again, by symmetry \_<f\iy=[<p\:= .... &c., for the

determinant will vanish identically exactly the same number of times
whichever rows are made the same.)

     The other cases to which Brill applies the theory of correspondences

in the paper under consideration are :

     {a) To find the mimher of triplets of points on a given base-curve
through which a doubly-infinite system of curves, contained within a ^-ply
infinite system, can he made to pass.

     (b) To find the number of sets of four points on a given base-curve
through which a triply-infinite system, of curves, contained within a &-ply
infinite system, can he made to pass.

    In the first of these A;=3, i=2 ; in the second A; =4, i=3. They are
both rather more complicated than the one we have considered in detail

the first, namely, involves finding the number of triplets of points which

satisfy three correspondences, for

          = + +. (3-f2)3 [(3 l)3(3)3]-[(3)3(2)3] (l)3,

and the number of independent equations (see p. 126) involved in

+ +DI3 2III3, !|3||] is 1=3, involved in [||3||3, II21I3] is l-f-2=3, and involved

in (1)3 is 3 ; similarly, the second involves finding the number of sets of
4 points which satisfy 4 correspondences, for here we have

       + +(4 3),=[(6),(4),]-[(5),(3),] [(4),(2),]-(l),,

and the total number of independent equations in each term of this

+ + +expression is 4, namely, 3 1, 2 2, 1 3 and 4. Moreover, it is essential

to the final evaluation to take notice of the way in which the 4 inde-

pendent equations are grouped ; the formulae in the theory of correspond-

ences for finding the number of sets of 4 points which satisfy 4 equations

when these 4 are grouped as 3 + 1 differs from that in which they are

+grouped as 2 2 ; but since the difference only appears in the terms

    Although most students of alloys are now convinced that they often

contain definite chemical compounds, yet these 'intermetallic' com-
pounds are still passed over in silence by the authors of books on descrip-
tive chemistry. The cause of this omission lies in the difficulty of isolating
these bodies in a pure state, and in their resemblance to the metals. It
must be acknowledged that just as the metals resemble one another more
than do the non-metals, so their compounds often present a gi-eat
superficial resemblance to their constituent elements. Intermetallic
compounds might well be compared to the somewhat intangible bodies
formed by the union of the halogens with each other and with sulphur.

--Many of these bodies show marked dissociation that is to say, they readily

form systems in true equilibrium with their components ; it is almost

certain that ' intermetallic ' compounds present the same phenomenon when

in contact with liquid alloy.

                      Methods of Studying Intermetallic Compounds.

     The method that naturally suggests itself to a chemist is that of ex-
tracting the pure compounds from an alloy by filtration, by volatilisation
of excess of a volatile metal, or by removing the excess of metal by
means of a suitable solvent. Each of these methods has been employed
with some success.

     Filtration methods are very difficult at high temperatures, but if the
difficulties can be overcome so that the first solid separating from a liquid

as it freezes is isolated, we shall get invaluable information. By the

filtration of a partly solidified solution of gold and cadmium in tin, Heycock
and Neville (') obtained a crystalline residue approximating to the formula

                                                                                                                K2

AuCd, even when the proportions of gold and cadmium in the original

mixture varied within wide limits. Again (-), by alloying gold with excess
of cadmium and distilling off the excess of cadmium they obtained a

residue having the. composition AuCd. Now that many metals have been

wdistilled vacuo this method may meet with success in other cases.

     M. Lebeau (^) dissolves metals in excess of sodium and distils off the

excess of sodium by the prolonged passage of ammonia gas followed by

that of nitrogen. He thus obtains the bodies SbNa^, BiNa^, Sn]Sra4 in a
pure state. He is also succeeding by the same method with the other

alkali metals. M. Joannis (*) some years ago applied a similar method

successfully.

     The method of fractional solution enabled Debray (") to isolate the
bodies PtSn^, RhSng, RuSn;,, by the action of dilute hydrochloric acid on

alloys containing excess of tin. M. Le Chatelier {^) has in the same way

isolated the compound Cu^Sn. He emphasises the opinion that by

choosing a suitable solvent, suggested by electro-chemical considerations,

the method will be found generally applicable. For example, by sub-

jecting alloys of copper and zinc to the prolonged action of a paste of

lead chloride he has obtained crystals of pure ZnqCu. Mr. Heycock, in

a research not yet published, obtained large crystalline grains of PtAl3

by the action of hydrochloric acid on a slowly cooled alloy of aluminium

and platinum. Mr. Stead (^) has isolated in this way crystals of SnSb,
Au4Pb, AusPbg, SnaAs,, and probably of some other alloys. The work

is in some cases not yet published, but he has been kind enough to com-

municate the results for the purpose of this report.

Other cases could no doubt be quoted in which fractional solution

leaves a residue ha^^ing a formula, but there is a great risk of the solvent

attacking the crystals ; and, as Mr. Stead has found, the existence of mixed

crystals, or, at all events, of crystals having a core different from the out-

side, is a sei-ious drawback to this method i-egarded as an independent
method of discovery. It would seem that the proper moment for the

application of these methods comes when by the microscope, by the

freezing-point curve, or by potential determinations the existence of a
compound has been already indicated.

In a systematic study of intermetallic compounds I should therefore

put first that of the chemical equilibrium of the binary system : this is
generally expressed by the freezing-point curve. Next, and perhaps of

equal importance, comes the microscopic examination of the solid alloys.

Thirdly, as more limited in scope, but sometimes more emphatic in its

indications, comes the determination of the difference of electrical potential

existing between a metal and its alloys.
    The method of studying chemical equilibrium which we owe so largely

to Professors Bakhuis Roozeboom and Le Chatelier is now familiar to

most chemists, and in the case of a binary system it can be sufficiently

Adescribed in a few words.  mixture of two substances, A and b, in

certain proportions is melted. It is allowed to cool slowly, and the

temperature is noted at which solid matter begins to separate from

the liquid. This is the 'freezing-point.' It tells us the temperature

--at which this particular mixture becomes saturated that is to say,

comes into equilibrium with a particular solid. By repeating the

experiment with a series of mixtures of A and b we get as many
points as we need for plotting the freezing-point curve. In this curve,

one ordinate is the percentage composition of the mixture expressed

either in weight per cent, of A and b, or, better, in atomic or molecular
ON THE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS CONTAINED IN ALLOCS.                   133

per cents. ; the other ordinate is temperature. It is desirable to observe
not only the first halt in the cooling, but also any lower ones that occur

down to the moment of complete solidification, or even below it. It is

also desirable to isolate by filtration the crystals which form at the freezing

point, and to analyse them. This would give the composition of the

solid and liquid phases which could exist in equilibrium at the observed

temperature. Unfortunately, on account of experimental difficulties,

isolation of the solid phase has not been carried out in the case of alloys,

and a later microscopic study of the wholly solid alloy is a very imperfect

substitute for it.

   We now know pretty well the types of freezing-point or equilibrium

--curves that occur. In the simplest of all cases that in which the two
--bodies a and b neither combine chemically nor form mixed crystals the

·complete curve resembles fig. 1. It consists of two

branches cutting each other at the eutectic angle.      Fig. 1.

One branch, which starts from the freezing-point of

a liquid wholly composed of A, corresponds to the

formation of primary crystals of pure A at each

freezing-point, the other branch to the formation of

primary crystals of pure B. When the liquid, either

from its initial composition or through the separation

of the primary crystals, reaches the composition of

the eutectic intersection, a and b crystallise simul-

tajieously but in separate crystals. Thus the solid

eutectic alloy is a very minute conglomerate, while     Cone
all other alloys contain large primary crystals of

either a or b embedded in this conglomerate. This

has been conclusively demonstrated by the exquisite microscopic work of

M. Osmond (®) and also by that of M. Charpy (^).
     Curves which approximate to this type have been worked (^° *"** ")

out for the pairs Zn.Al, Zn.Sn, Au.Cu, Ag.Cu, and some other

metals. Such curves do not indicate the existence of a compound,

though it would be too much to say that they disprove the existence of

compounds.

    When a compound exists whose melting-point lies in the region above

the freezing-point curve of the two metals, it produces a separate branch

cutting the other two branches. At points on this intermediate branch

the saturated liquid deposits crystals of the compound. The summit

of this branch occurs at the concentration corresponding to the formula

of the compound. If more than one compound exists there is a branch

for each compound, although parts of the branches may be lost by lying

below the curves of more stable bodies.

While the above is the usually accepted view as to the meaning of

summits and eutectic angles in a freezing-point curve, two points may be

noted. The first is M. Le Chatelier's opinion as to the position of the

summit caused by a compound. He thinks ('^) that when a compound

partly dissociates on fusion, the summit caused by its presence may not

be exactly at the percentage composition corresponding to its formula,

and that the formation of mixed cry.stals may have a similar effect on the

curve. This is a matter needing further investigation. The other point

concerns the position of the eutectic angle. While it is well established

that the eutectic alloy is a conglomerate, not a compound, we should be

·wrong to ignore the fact that the angle often comes surprisingly near to

--a simple formula for example, in the AgCu and AuCu curves. Sir George

Stokes has lately recalled our attention to this point. Paterno and
Ampolla (·^) have noticed a number of similar cases in organic

mixtures.

   A good many curves indicating by intermediate branches the

existence of compounds have now been determined, but for the purpose
of illustrating the subject further the curve of AuAl will be taken.

    As can be seen from fig. 2, there are seven branches, each corre-

                                                                    FiG. 2.

AB and IJ, being regarded as those of the two metals, we have five left,
each of which Tnay indicate a compound. The branch def has its
summit exactly at the formula AuoAl. The microscope shows that the
summit alloy e is an almost homogeneous body, and that all solid alloys
whose composition lies between that of d and f contain large crystals of
the E body immersed in a mother substance. As we descend the curve
from the summit the large crystals of E are found to occupy less and less

of the whole alloy, until at d and f they cease to exist. Exactly similar

phenomena show themselves on the branch ghi ; the summit h occurs
at the formula AuAlo, and large crystals of this body are found embedded

--in mother substance in all alloys between g and i.
     These criteria taken together ^(1) the occurrence of a summit at a
formula percentage, (2) the presence of large crystals of the same kind,

--decreasing in amount as we descend the branch on either side are, I

believe, an absolute proof of the reality of a compound. The two bodies
AuqAI and AuAL, as certainly exist as do the two chlorides of copper.

But there are other compounds more obscurely indicated by the curve
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the branch fq has its summit, x, below the branch gh, hence the x

body which crystallises at points on gp never occurs alone in a solid

alloy. The microscope shows that solid alloys between G and H contain

large crystals of AuAl,, surrounded by a coating of the x body, and that

oatside this coating there are large independent crystals of x embedded

in a minute conglomerate of x and e. The fact is that in the first stage

of freezing, while the large crystals of AuAlj, or h, are forming, the

liquid part necessarily gets richer in gold until it reaches the composition

G. From this moment the H

crystals cease to form, and the              Fig. 3.

with the x body, which at

lower temperatures crystallises

independently in large crys- 1000

to be a very common case ; for

example, Mr. Stead finds that

crystals of Cu-^Sii are coated      soo

in the bronzes very rich in         400

MM. Le Chatelier ('*), Gautier, and Gosselin ('°) have traced a number

of remarkable freezing-point curves for pairs of metals, of which

examples are given here. Unfortunately the composition is stated in

percentage by weight, not in atomic per cents.

   --Copper- Aluminium (fig. 3). Here we find two well-marked summits,

one very exactly at CugAl, the other near CuAla.

   --Copper-AntimonT/ (fig. 3). Here there is a well-marked intermediate

summit which, if it were at a formula point, would almost certainly

indicate a compound. M. Le Chatelier attributes the formula CuoSb to

it, but measurement on the curve seems to give the summit the formula
Cu^Sbj. These two curves, and one of SnCu also due to M. Le Chatelier,

are especially interesting, as they were the first high-temperature curves

of this kind with intermediate summits due to compounds that had been

published, and the paper ('·) in which they appeared marks a new

departure in the subject of alloys.

  --Aluminium-Antimony (fig. 4). The maximum point is very much

higher than that of either metal ; it is at 1048° C. with 14'66 per cent, of
aluminium. The curve is remarkable because it shows that nearly all

mixtures melt above the melting-point of either component.

Fio. 4.  curves of great interest, some

         of which were simultaneously

         studied by Heycock and Ne-

         ville (^'), but many of them

         need further work before they

         can be safely interpreted.

                    Perhaps the freezing-point

         curves investigated by M.

         Kurnakov throw as clear a

         light on intermetallic com-

         pounds as any work that has

         been done. This work can be

         readily followed from the two

         diagrams contained in his paper,

         and reproduced in figs. 5 and 6.
         The composition is expressed

         in atomic percentages. The

         first diagram (fig. 5) gives the
         freezing-point curves of amal-

         gams of sodium and potassium.

         In the HgNa curve at least six

         separate branches can be seen,

         each corresponding to the crys-

         tallisation of a difierent solid.

         It would be premature to as-

         sert that each branch proves

         the existence of a correspond-

         ing chemical compound, but

         there can be no doubt that the

         summit G proves the existence

         of the compound NaHg,, a

         body whose melting-point is

         much higher than that of either

         component. Similarly, in the

curve for potassium amalgams, besides minor branches there is a well-
marked summit at the formula KHga-

     The other figure (fig. 6) gives the freezing-point curves of the mixtures
NaBi, NaPb, NaCd. It is unfortunate that so few alloys were examined
on the upper part of the NaBi curve, but the existence of the freezing-
point M above 700° C. makes a compound very probable. M. Kurnakov

seems to have no doubt that it indicates Na-jBi, a body already prepared

by Joannis and by Lebeau. There are two summits on the NaPb curve

one at p, which must be very near the formula Na2Pb and one at p' to

which he does not at present assign a formula. In the NaCd curve we

see two well-marked summits, at o and o', the first being exactly at the
formula NaCdg. It is evident from these curves that the summits of

many of the branches lie below other branches, and therefore correspond

to unstable states. The position of the summit and the formula of the
compound must in such cases be a matter of speculation until experi-
ments of another kind have been made.^

     M. Kurnakov has also studied the crystalline matter which separates

at the freezing-points, and has noted great variations in this as one goes

from one branch to another. He separated by filtration the hexagonal

plates which crystallise at points along the branch bc, and analysed them.

He found, however, that the composition of the crystals varied from
point to point along the branch. He attributes this to the presence of

mother liquor attached to the crystals, and he thinks that the crystals, if
free from mother liquor, would have had the formula NaaHg. This is a

very reasonable supposition, but it may be that he was examining mixed
crystals. The formation of mixed crystals of two bodies which crystallise
isomorphously is certainly common in alloys, and may be the cause of

singularities in the freezing-point curve. Indeed, it is doubtful if we

shall arrive at certainty in the interpretation of such curves until? this

question of mixed crystallisation has been thoroughly studied. M. Le

Chatelier some years ago pointed out the importance of this question and

studied it.

     The curve for mixtures of silver and gold has been quoted as a type
for bodies which form mixed crystals in all proportions. It is a con-

Fig. 6.             tinuous curve joining the

                    points of fusion of the two

l^oL^BlNn^Pl  Na M  components, and diflfers from

                    of two bodies, one or both

                    of which were compound,

                    might be indicated by a

                    continuous curve joining the

                    freezing-points of the two

                    proximate constituents of

                    the crystals. There are

                    probably several such cases

                    in the curves given by M.

                    Gautier. Charpy and Stead

                    have independently studied

                    with the microscope a pe-

                    culiar crystal structure which

                    they conjecture to be due to

                    mixed crystallisation. But

                    no case of isomorphism in

                    alloys lias been worked out

                    in a manner that is con-

                    clusive. Until lately a

                    satisfactory theory of the

                    subject was lacking, but
                    Professor Roozeboom (i°), to

                    whom physical chemists owe

                    so much, has lately investi-

                    gated it, and MM. Van

                    Eyk, Reinders, and Hissink

                    have verified his views

                    in the case of certain mix-

                    tures of two salts. It

                    seems very desirable that

                    students of alloys should

                    begin to work in the light

Atomic percentage.  Anof this theory.  at-

                    tempt will therefore be

made here to state Roozeboom 's view in the simplest case he gives.
     For this purpose we must look again at fig. 1, the curve for a pair of

metals which neither combine chemically nor form mixed crystals. Here

the region above the curve corresponds to liquid states, the line of the
curve to equilibrium between a liquid and crystals of A for the left branch
and B on the right branch ; the region below the curve, but above the
angle, to mixtures of solid a or b with varying liquids ; and, finally, all the
       ON THE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS CONTAINED IN ALLOYS.            139

region below the eutectic angle to solid conglomerates of separate crystals
of A and B. The range of temperature between the first appearance of

crystals in a liquid alloy and its complete solidification is measured by the
vertical line drawn from a point on the curve to the level of the eutectic point.

    Let us now suppose that the two metals, which we will still call a and

B, can form mixed crystals in all proportions. According to Roozeboom

there will be no angle of intersection of the two curves, but the freezing-

points of A and B will be joined by a continuous curve, the points on

Hewhich cori-espond to exactly saturated liquids.       calls this the ' L ' or

' liquid ' curve. But also starting from the freezing-points of A and b,

and lying under the ' l ' curve, a continuous curve can be drawn giving

the composition of the mixed crystals that form at each temperature. He

calls  this  the   s'            or  ' solid '  curve.  The case is represented in fig. 7,
                              '

which, together with figs. 8 and 9, is taken from his paper. To find what

happens at a particular temperature, draw a horizontal line cutting the
' L ' curve in 7i and the s curve in o. These two points of intersection

give the composition of the two phases that can exist together at the
temperature of the horizontal line. In fig. 7 n gives the composition of
the liquid that when it begins to freeze deposits

mixed crystals of the percentage o.                     Fig. 7.

The complete process of freezing can now

be stated. Draw through n a vertical line

mnqz cutting the L curve in n and the s curve

in q. Then n and all points above it correspond

to uniform liquid, q and all points below it to a

uniform mass of mixed crystals (not, as in fig. 1,

to a conglomerate of crystals of A and b). The

temperature range during freezing nis q, and

during the process, if perfect equilibrium is

ensured, the solids formed undergo continuous

transformation from the composition o to that                z

of q, while the liquid remaining at any moment            Cone
changes from n to p, where p is the intersection

--of|L by a horizontal through q. Thus all the areas shaded vertically repre-

sent homogeneous states above l of a liquid, below s of homogeneous

crystals. The part between l and s, shaded horizontally, represents states,

in which a solid is mixed with a liquid.

The L and s curves may have a maximum or a minimum, in both of

which cases they touch each other at the maximum or minimum point, as

in figs. 8 and 9.

The liquid whose composition is that of the maximum or minimum

will solidify completely at one temperature. Hence in the case of the

maximum one might mistake the solid for a definite chemical compound,

and in the case of a minimum for a eutectic mixture. One must remember

that the diagram need not stand for the whole freezing-point curve

of two elements, but for the horizontal space between the two points

corresponding to compounds, and we can treat the compounds themselves

as the components of the mixed crystals. Our copper-tin curve probably

shows such a case in the region between Cu^Sn and Cu^Sn.

     These considerations point to a great danger in the interpretations of
the minor details in complicated freezing-point curves such as those of

Kurnakov, Gautier, and our AuAl curve. Given perfect equilibrium

transformations during cooling, it should be fairly easy by appropriate

experiments to discriminate between a summit due to the existence of a
chemical compound and one due to the form of a mixed crystal curve. In

such cases as Kurnakov's NaHg.j and KHgo, our AugAl, and Roberts-

Austen's AuAlj, where the formula of the summit is an exact and simple

Aone, there can be little doubt.            microscopic examination of the summit

alloy might not help, but that of alloys at some distance on either side

of the summit ought to settle the matter. If they are homogeneous, give

a uniform ignition colour, and etch all over at the same rates, the summit

must be due to mixed crystals ; while if the alloys show primary ci-ystalli-
sation embedded in a mother substance, the primary crystals continually

decreasing in amount as we go down the curve, the summit is probably a

compound. This is the structure we found near the two summits of the
AuAl curve.

But Roozeboom points out as the best method of attacking such

questions the two following series of experiments : (1) Determine not

only the freezing-point of each alloy, but also the temperature at which it

sets to a solid mass. From these data, both of the curves l and s

could be plotted. The setting-point would probably not be very sharply

marked, but a recording pyrometer would indicate its whereabouts by a

greater rapidity in cooling after the point was passed. Cooling-curves

such as those of Sir W. Roberts- Austen might be made to give the

information needed for plotting the s curve. We, in a very imperfect
way, sought for the setting-points in determining our AuAl curves, but

found instead the usual horizontal lines of second freezing-points. The

existence of these renders mixed crystals improbable.

    The other line of research, adopted by Reinders and Van Eyk and

Hissink, is to extract the first crystals that form and analyse them, as

·well as the mother liquor from which they were taken. If this were done

for alloys on either side of a summit due to a compound, we should find

--the crystals having all the same composition namely, that of the com-

pound                             while if  the summit were due  to the existence of  mixed crystals,
                               ;

the solids extracted from alloys of various compositions would differ widely.

There can be no doubt that this process, troublesome though it would be,

is the proper way to attack the interpretation of a complicated freezing-

point curve.

   A few cases out of many may be mentioned where mixed crystals are

probable in alloys : between CugSn and Cu4Sn, in lead-thallium alloys,

in bismuth-antimony, in gold-silver, in alloys containing zinc or cadmium

with either silver, copper, or gold.

   A careful study of some of these cases is probably the most pressing

need at present in intermetallic chemistry. The difficulty of this subject,
whether we use the freezing-point curve or the microscope, is increased
by the uncertainty as to the maintenance of perfect equilibrium at each

stage of the cooling.

                                       Microscopic Examination.

     Osmond, Charpy, and Stead have shown us how much light the micro-

scope throws on our subject.
     The microscopic examination of the pattern shown by the polished

surface of an alloy that has, if necessary, been etched or heated to
produce oxidation colours seems to bring us nearer to the phenomena
than other methods of experiment. It is often quite easy to determine
which crystals formed first in the freezing (the primary crystallisation),

but there are certain types of pattern that are veiy puzzling. Among the

points calling for an answer are the following :

      1 Does the existence of coated crystals, such as one finds in gunmetal
and also bronzes containing more tin than Cu3Sn, indicate the existence

--of a second compound ? The answer is. Yes, in ,some cases for example,

in the AuAl curve and, as Mr. Stead thinks, in the bronzes rich in tin,

where the Cu^Sn crystals are coated with CuSn. M. Le Chatelier has

lately pointed out that in all such cases the solid alloy is not in equili-
brium and that the eff'ects of annealing will generally be great.

     2. Can the existence of series of mixed crystals be detected by the

microscope ?

     M. Charpy and Mr. Stead both describe a similar structure, and are

disposed to attribute it to this cause.

    3. How far will the microscope supplement the very meagre indica-

tions that the curve sometimes gives of a compound ?
     As an answer one can take the portion of our copper-tin freezing-point

curve (fig. 10) between Cu4Sn and Cu^Sn. The curve is almost straight,
the swelling (one cannot call it a summit) corresponding to CugSn being
very slight. But the microscope shows Cu^Sn as a homogeneous body,
while alloys with a little more tin show new crystals embedded in this
and sharply separated. These new crystals increase as we add more tin,
until at CuaSn they fill the whole alloy ; thus the microscope is here much
more decisive in its indications than the curve.

                                       Rontgen-ray Photography.

      Skiagraphs of thin sections of alloy which contain one transparent
metal, such as sodium or aluminium, and one metal moi'e opaque, some-
times give fine views of the crystals in the alloy. This method has the
advantage of showing the structure of the alloy as it is before any etching
or other reagent has modified it. The two photographs shown were taken
some years ago by Mr. Heycock and myself. The first is aluminium

alloyed with ten per cent, of antimony. One sees that a heavy compound
has crystallised out first. This is in harmony with M. Gautier's curve

which presents no branch along which primary crystals of aluminium
 could form. If a series of such photographs had been taken with increas-

ing percentages of Sb, we might have been able to locate the percentage
 at which the compound was pure.
--142 REPORT 1900,

     The other photograph is one of aluminium containing ten per cent, of
nickel. One sees that an opaque body has again crystallised first The
varying thickness of some of the crystals gives them an effect of solidity
which is absent from a surface photograph.

     Unfortunately the alloys have to be very slowly cooled in order to

compounds of A and B exist,

that one nearest in composi-

tion to A will be indicated by

a marked fall in the potential

going from A to B along the

curves showing that this is

the case with the following

pairs :

ZnAg at Zn4Ag.
ZnSb at ZnSb,.

are reproduced in this report
(fig. 11), show that the phe-

nomena are well marked.
The numbers in the figures

     If we compare Hersch-
kowitz's SnCu curve with

our freezing-point curve for
the same metallic pair in
which the indication of the
existence of SnCu^ is of the

slightest kind, we see how
very useful the method may

be in detecting compounds.

It appears, however, that

only one compound of each
metal pair is likely to be
indicated by the method. It
is probable that the method,

if it can be carried out accu-

rately, will give us valuable 0% ID

indications as to the solubility

--of one metal in the other in the solid state a point on which both the

microscope and the freezing-point curve are ambiguous. Although Laurie
was the originator of this method, the work of Herschkowitz has been
quoted, as it is more recent and founded on a clearer theory.

                                         Heat of Formation.

     It is probable that if two metals form compounds whose lieat of

formation is considerable, whether positive or negative, and if we could
determine the heat of formation of a series of binary alloys of these two
metals, we should find a maximum or a minimum heat evolution at

formulae corresponding to those of the compounds. Herschkowitz has
attempted to find these heats of formation by dissolving first the metals,

then the alloy, in a solution oE bromine and KBr in water, and taking

the difference as the heat of formation of the alloy. But his results,
though not unpromising, do not yet throw much light on our subject.
One objection to his method lies in the necessity of crushing his metals
and alloys to ensure rapid solution in the calorimeter. Now, as Mr.
Rosenhain has pointed out to me, it is certain that the crushed alloy,
each fragment of which has been strained, possesses more energy than it
did before crushing, and this may be quite important as compared with

the small heats of formation observed.
     Gait Q^) and other workers have followed similar methods, but the

solvent (nitric acid) used by him does not seem a safe one, as the gaseous

products of solution may be so varied that one can feel no certainty that

the final state was the same in the solution of the metals and of the alloy.
In Tayler's (^"') method of dissolving the metals and the alloy in mercury
there is not this danger, but the applicability of the method is more

limited.

                                   Electric Conductivity of Alloys.

     Since Matthiessen and Wiedemann studied the remarkable changes in

conductivity produced by alloying two metals, this subject has been one
of great ititerest. But it is doubtful if research in this direction will

help us much in detecting the existence of compounds. For the increase
in resistance due to alloying two metals, while partly due to the Peltier

effects at the innumerable surfaces of contact of the crystals forming the
alloy, is also due to the mechanical discontinuities and gaps which exist
in alloys. It would be very difficult to distinguish quantitatively between

the effects due to the two causes. The impossibility of drawing many

alloys into wire, and the changes caused by drawing those which are
ductile, also limit and complicate this method of research.

     Professor Ramsay and M. Tammann in 1890 showed thab small

 quantities of various metals dissolved in mercury gave, for the most part,

 depressions of the vapour-pressure and of the freezing-point, which indi-

 cated that the dissolved molecule contained one atom of the added metal.

 At the same time, Mr. Heycock and I found that this was in general true
 when metals were dissolved in tin. At later dates we extended the

 generalisation to solutions of metals in the solvents bismuth, cadmium,
 lead, and zinc, and tables summarising our results are reproduced in the
 present report. If we could be certain that the dissolved metal did not
 form a chemical compound with the solvent, these results would afford
 very strong grounds for holding that the molecules of the dissolved metals

were in most cases monatomic. But we know now that chemical com-
bination is not uncommon, and it is evident that in dilute solution the
 dissolved metal a will tend to form compounds of the type A b,,,, where b
is the solvent. Hence the problem of the chemical compounds formed by
metals with the solvent metal must be solved before we can safely
dogmatise concerning the molecular weight of the metals when in solution.
To take a special case, one atom of copper dissolved in tin produces the
molecular depression of the freezing-point, but from Mr. Stead's work we

have good reason to attribute this to the presence of a molecule CuSn.

     On the other hand, the abnormal depressions obtained by us in certain

cases point to the probability of the compounds Bi,,As,, Bi Cu^ Cd Ho-,
Cd,,Zn,, Cd,,Pd,, Cd,,K,, Cd,,Au,, Cd,,As,,, Pb,,(Cd, Hg, Bi)^, PblSn;!
Pb,,Na^, most of which have not at present been studied. It is obvious
that n may be zero in any of these.

     The question of the depression of the freezing-point in dilute solutions,

is, however, complicated by the probable appreciable solubility of the
dissolved metal in the solid crystals of solvent, and by all the thermal
difficulties that ISTernst and Abegg have discussed.

     The fascinating question as to the condition of association or dis-

sociation of the molecules of the compounds when melted or in solution
also comes in when we attempt to interpret our tables, or, indeed, when
we examine any freezing-point curve. But it is possible to study inter-
metallic compounds without touching this question, and in the present

report I have thought it best to do so.

     The vast subject of ternary and more complex mixtures has also been
avoided as too complex for the present purpose, although Behrens,
Stead, and especially Charpy, have made most interesting studies of such

mixtures.

     I have to thank Mr. Heycock for continued assistance in drawing up
this report. I have also to thank Mr. Stead and Professor H. Le Chatelier

for valuable information and valuable references.

The work of collecting, verifying, and systematically arranging the titles

of papers bearing on spectroscopy has been steadily carried on during the
past year ; and the Committee ask to be reappointed for one more year,
with the intention of presenting to the Association at its next meeting
the final instalment of the ' Catalogue of Spectroscopic Literature,' com-
menced in 1870. It is proposed to end the catalogue with the present
century, since the very satisfactory character of the proceedings at the
last conference of the delegates appointed to arrange the compilation
of an International Catalogue of Scientific Papers seems to warrant the
conclusion that, as from January 1, 1901, the services of the Committee
will be no longer needed.

--Absorption Spectra and Ghemical Constitution of Organic Substances.

    Interim Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. Noel

     Hartley (^Chairman and Secretary), Professor F. R. Japp, and

      Professor J. J. Dobbie, appointed to investigate the Relation

      between the Absorption Spectra and Ghemical Constitution of Organic

       Substances.

Four informal meetings have been held during the year, and, as
much work is still in progress, it has been considered desirable that an

interim report of that which has been completed should be presented.
This consists of five communications published by the Chemical Society

in their ' Transactions ' since March last. Two of these deal with the sub-

ject of tautomerism and one with stereo-isomerism. The fourth is a
study of ammonia and its derivatives, of hydroxylamine and oximes ; and
the fifth an examination of some closed-chain compounds one of which
contains two nitrogen atoms. Details of the measurements of the spectra
are omitted from this report for the sake of brevity. In connection with
the nitrogen compounds a brief abstract of a previous publication has
been included. It is of interest because it leads towards the conclusion
that there are two distinct classes of albuminoids, some of which have
long been known to act as enzymes or soluble ferments towards the

carbohydrates.

     According to theory, thirteen isomerides of diethyl dibenzoylsuccinate
have a possible existence, but only three have so far been prepared and

studied. On chemical grounds Knorr "^ regards one of the three as an
enolic, and the other two as ketonic esters. He assigns to the enolic or

a-ester the constitutional formula

without deciding which of the three possible stereo-isomeric modifica-
tions of this formula represents the substance examined by him. The
two ketonic esters are structurally identical but configuratively difi'erent.
To one of them, which he designates the para- or /5-ester, Knorr assigns
the formula (a), and to the other, which he designates the meso-, anti
or y-ester, the formula (6).

   A mixture of the ft- and y-esters is readily obtained by adding an

ethereal solution of iodine to the sodium derivative of ethyl benzoyl-
acetate, obtained by the action of metallic sodium on an ethereal solution
of the ester. The two ketonic esters are readily separated from one

another by fractional crystallisation. When either of them is treated

with sodium methoxide, a yellow crystalline meal, consisting of the
sodium derivative of the a-ester, is obtained. The aqueous solution of

this substance, when treated with excess of dilute sulphuric acid at the
freezing temperature, yields the o-ester, which separates as a thick oil
possessing the colour of chlorine gas. The /tester, which was first
described by von Baeyer and Perkin,' melts at 128-130°, the y-ester at
75°, and the former is less soluble than the latter in most solvents. Both
esters are optically inactive, the p-ester by external, the y-ester by
internal compensation. The ketonic esters are neutral to litmus, and
practically insoluble in cold dilute alkalis. In their chemical properties

they are exactly alike.

     The a-ester differs, both in physical and chemical properties, from
the ketonic esters. It is an oily liquid, has a strongly acid reaction,
and dissolves in cold dilute alkalis. It gives a characteristic dirty brown
coloration with ferric chloride, which is not shown by the ketonic
esters, and moreover is unstable, gradually passing into a mixture of
the ft- and y-esters at the ordinary temperature, the change taking place

quickly at 130°.

      f the view put forward by Knorr as to the relation of the three esters
to one another is correct, the ft- and y-esters should give very similar,
if not identical, absorption curves, since stereo-isomerides which differ
only in the configuration of their asymmetric carbon atoms so far as they
have been investigated in essential oils and their hydrocarbons, are not
found to differ either in the amount or the character of their absorption.
The a-ester, on the other hand, having a different constitution, should

exhibit a distinct series of absorption spectra.

   We have photographed and measured the spectra of alcoholic solu-

tions of the three substances, and the results obtained entirely bear out
the conclusions arrived at by Knorr on purely chemical grounds. The
spectra of the ketonic esters are identical. The amount of absorption is

considerable, all rays beyond ^/X 2795 being cut off by a layer 25 mm.

thick of a solution containing 1 milligram-mol. in 100 c.c. of alcohol.
There is also a well-marked band of selective absorption reaching from

^/\ 3824 to ^ /\ 4306 in a layer 3 mm. thick of a solution containing

1 milligram-mol. of the ester in 2500 c.c. of alcohol. This band is very

persistent, and is still distinctly marked in a layer 4 mm. thick of a solu-

tion containing only 1 milligram-mol. in 12,500 c.c. of alcohol.

     The spectrum of the «- or enolic form is quite different from that

of the ketonic esters. The general absorption is greater, a layer 25 mm.

thick of a solution containing 1 milligram-mol. in 100 c.c. of alcohol

cutting off all rays beyond ^/\ 2171. The absorption band of the
ketonic esters is altogether absent, whilst a well-marked band makes its
appearance in a layer 5 mm. thick of a solution containing 1 milli-

     The absorption curves for the ketonic and enolic forms are shown in
the diagram on p. 156.

    When the solution of the a-ester was allowed to stand, and photo-

graphs were taken after successive intervals of time, the transition from
the enolic to the ketonic form could be clearly traced. After an interval
of only three hours, the absorption band of the enolic ester had almost
entirely disappeared, ichilst the amount of general absorption had also
appreciably diminished. Solutions containing 1 milligram-mol. in 100
and 500 c.c. respectively showed after forty-eight hours a great diminution
in the amount of the general absorption, whilst after three weeks the
curve coincided almost exactly with that of the /3- and y-esters, as shown
on p. 155.

     The result of this investigation exemplifies the value of the spectro-
graphic method, and shows how it might be applied with advantage

to the investigation of similar cases of isomerism either to guide the

chemical investigation or to confirm the conclusions drawn from it,
especially when any doubt exists as to whether the isomerism is due

to a diSerence in constitution or merely to a difference in the arrange-

ment of the atoms in space. The amount of substance required for the
experiments is small, and can generally be recovered again from the solu-

tion.

     The esters were prepared by the method described by Knorr.'
The preparation of the /3- and y-esters offers no difficulty : the
a-ester is only obtained when strict attention is paid to all the details

given by Knorr. Two distinct preparations of each of the ketonic

esters and three preparations of the a-ester were made. Each prepara-
tion was photographed several times without any difference being ob-
served in the photographs of the same substance. In the case of the
o-ester the photographs were taken immediately after the completion
of the preparation, as the change to the ketonic form sets in almost at

once.

     The substance o-oxycarbanil, C7H5O.2N, and its alkyl derivatives form
a group of compounds which stand in the same relation to one another as
isatin, carbostyril, and their respective alkyl derivatives.

     o-Oxycarbanil can be prepared by the fusion of o-aminophenol hydro-
chloride with urea, or from its lactim ether by the action of concentrated
hydrochloric acid."* It can also be obtained by the distillation of o-amino-

phenyl ethyl carbonate."* Two ethyl derivatives of o-oxycarbanil are
known. One of these is prepared by boiling o-oxycarbanil for some time

under a reflux condenser with equivalent quantities of ethyl iodide and
alcoholic potash, the other by the interaction of o-aminophenol and ethyl
iminocarbonate. The ether obtained by the first method is considered
to be a lactam, that is, to have the ethyl group directly attached
to the nitrogen atom, because on heating for some time with hydrochloric
acid it takes up water and decomposes into carbon dioxide and the hydro-

    As in the similai* cases of isatin and carbostyril, the chemical evidence

leaves the question of the constitution of o-oxycarbanil itself undecided.

On the one hand, its formation by the distillation of o-aminophenyl

ethyl carbonate is most easily explained on the assumption that it has the

ABSORPTION SPECTRA AND CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION.           157

The present investigation was undertaken with the view of ascertain-

ing whether a comparison of the absorption spectra of the two ethers

with the absorption spectra of o-oxycarbanil would, as in the cases of
isatin and carbostyril/ yield results from which the constitution of the

parent substance might be inferred. Assuming that one or other of the

ethers differs from o-oxycarbanil only in the substitution of the alkyl

group for an atom of hydrogen, the constitution of the two substances

being otherwise identical, we should expect the absorption spectra of the

parent substance and this ether to be practically the same. On the other

hand, the ether which differs in constitution from the parent substance

should give a different spectrum. Groenvik '^ gives 136-138°, Sandmeyer

137°, and Bender 141°, as the melting-point of o-oxycarbanil. Although,

apart from this slight difference, there was no reason to doubt the identity

of the substances obtained by these chemists, we thought it well to ex-

amine specimens prepared independently by two different methods and

selected for the purpose, the substances obtained by fusion of o-amino-

phenol with urea and by the decomposition of the lactim ether with
Wehydrochloric acid.
                         found that the two specimens when heated side

by side in capillary tubes behaved in exactly the same way, softening at

137° and melting completely at 139°-5. Solutions of the two specimens

gave identical spectra.

The spectra of o-oxycarbanil and of the lactam ether are almost iden-

tical. The amount of general absorption is practically the same in both,

and the spectra of both substances show a well-marked absorption band
occupying the same position and persisting, in both cases, through the

eame range of dilution. The spectra of the enolic ether, on the other
hand, show a smaller amount of general absorption, and the absorption

band does not appear until a much greater degree of dilution is reached

than is required to bring out the band in the other two substances. The

range of the band of the enolic ester is also very small. The above curves
drawn from the photographs, show very clearly the relations between

the spectra of the various substances.

The conclusion to which the investigation leads is that o-oxycarbanil

has the same structure as the lactam or ketonic ether, or, at all events

that the lactam structure very greatly predominates, if the assumption is

made that the parent substance in solution is a mixture of two tautomeric

forms. It is worthy of note that in the three cases of this kind which

have now been examined the parent substance possesses the ketonic or
lactam constitution. o-Oxycarbanil, it may be noted, gives no colour

reaction with ferric chloride.

The substances used in this investigation were prepared exactly in

accordance with the directions given in the papers already quoted. Two

distinct preparations of each substance were made and several series of

photographs were taken of the absorption spectra of each preparation.

No appreciable difference could be detected in the various photographs of

the same substance. This is satisfactory evidence of the identity of the
compounds, and also of the purity of these particular preparations.

The Absorption Spectra of Ammonia, Methylam,ine, Hydroxylamine,
                             Aldoxime, and Acetoxime}

It was shown by L. Soret that commercial ammonia, even after many

recrystallisations as sulphate, still shows an absorption band. Hartley

and Huntington (' Phil. Trans.,' 1879, Part I., 267) contirmed this observa-

tion, and, believing the absorption to be due to traces of some constituent

of gas-liquor, examined specimens of what was sold as ' volcanic ' ammonia

of special purity for analytical purposes. Three separate samples were

examined, each measuring half a gallon, with the result that all the rays

beyond '/'^ 2638-2 (A 2747'7) were absorbed by the strong solution in acell

A15 mm. in thickness.  very distinct absorption band was visible on

diluting the liquid with eight volumes of water, and was still seen until

sixteen volumes had been added.

This result appeared remarkable in view of the fact that gaseous

ammonia, at atmospheric pressure, in a tube 1 metre in length showed

no selective absorption, and that ethylamine, even when solutions
containing as much as 33 per cent, of the base were examined in cells
25 mm. in thickness, transmitted continuous spectra with very little

absorption.

Carbamide also showed no absorption band, but transmitted a con-

Atinuous spectrum.^  10 per cent, solution of carbamide in a cell 15 mm.

in thickness transmits all rays to A 2140, rays more refrangible than

X 2750 being slightly weakened.

    When we remember that practically all the ammonia of commerce

is obtained from coal tar, and is liable to contain minute traces of the

volatile bases of the pyridine and other series, which can only be com-

pletely separated with great difficulty, it is obvious that great care must

be taken to obtain chemically pure ammonia for examination before any

trustworthy conclusion can be arrived at as to the character of its absorp-

tion spectrum.

The following investigation was undertaken with the view of definitely

ascertaining whether or not chemically pure ammonia shows selective

absorption. An examination of ordinary aqueous ammonia was first made

Ain order to determine the exact position of its absorption band.  tube

150 mm. long was used. With this thickness of layer a solution containing

5 grams of ammonia in 100 c.c. water showed complete absorption beyond

A^/A 3638 (\ 2749).  layer of the same thickness containing 2'5 grams

of ammonia in 100 c.c. gave a continuous spectrum to '/'^ 3694 {\ 2707),

a broad absorption band occupying that portion of the spectrum

which lies between '/X 3694 (\ 2707) and ^ jX 4306 (X 2322), the spectrum
again showing beyond this point. This band is persistent, being still

traceable in a solution containing only 0'625 gram of ammonia in 100 c.c.

All the samples of commercial ammonia examined showed selective
absorption, but by converting the base into ammonium chloride the

absorption band was found to become less marked in the spectrum after

successive crystallisations of the salt.

In order to^try the eiiect of crystallisation of one of the less soluble

salts, ammonia was converted into oxalate and the salt repeatedly

crystallised. The oxalate was distilled with pure potassium hydroxide and

the ammonia absorbed in pure distilled water, the spectrum of which was

photographed on the same plate as that of the ammonia solution. Much

greater thicknesses of liquid were examined than in previous experiments.

   A layer 200 mm. thick of a solution containing 10'6 per cent, of ammonia

prepared in this way from oxalate transmitted all rays to ^/A. 3638 (/\2749),

but the spectrum was feeble from \IK 2738 (\ 3652) to i/X 3638 (\ 2749).

ANo band was visible.  layer 100 mm. thick transmitted the rays to

V\ 4323 (\ 231 3), but the spectrum was very feeble beyond VX 3904 (X 2561).

    From another portion of the purified oxalate the liberated ammonia

was passed into optically pure hydrochloric acid ; the ammonium chloride

recrystallised several times was then examined, the solution of the salt

employed having the same thickness of layer and containing the same

amount of ammonia as that previously used in determining the position

of the absorption band in ordinary ammonia. It now showed no trace of

selective absorption, the spectrum being continuous to '/X 4666 (X 2143)

with a scarcely perceptible weakness at the extreme ultra-violet end. Pure

ammonia may therefore be obtained without difficulty by the decomposition

of a crystallised ammonium salt such as the oxalate.

Ammonia obtained from Hijdroxylamine.

Ammonia obtained by the reduction of hydroxylamine was next

examined. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride was reduced with a zinc-

copper couple and the ammonia distilled  into pure    hydrochloric  acid
                                                                                       ;

the ammonium chloride thus obtained was subsequently purified by

recrystallisation.

   A layer of 150 mm. of a solution containing 2*5 grams ammonia in

100 c.c. distilled water showed a continuous spectrum to ^/X 4411 (A 2267) ;
the spectrum is weak from '/X 3886 (\ 2573), but there was no indication

of selective absorption.

    As therefore neither ordinary ammonia, which has been carefully
purified by the above method, nor ammonia obtained by the reduction
of hydroxylamine, shows selective absorption, we conclude that the
absorption band of ordinary ammonia is due to the presence of

traces of foreign substances which distil over with it from the gas

liquor.

   We next endeavoured to ascertain the nature, and estimate the

amount, of the impurity to which the band of ordinary aqueous am-

monia is due. The position of the band seemed to indicate the pyridine
bases as the most likely cause of the absorption, and, in fact, we
found that a layer of 150 mm. thick of a solution containing 7"68 grams
of pure ammonium chloride (equivalent to 2*5 grams of ammonia) and

  '00001 gram of pyridine in 100 c.c. water, showed almost exactly the
same amount and character of absorption as a layer of ordinary aqueous
ammonia of the same thickness and strength.

     In a further experiment we found that the addition of the same
amount of pyridine (in the form of hydrochloride) to 100 c.c. of distilled

water produced an identical result, the spectrum being hardly distin-

guishable from that of ordinary aqueous ammonia.' It follows, there-

     ' In this connection it is interesting to note that, although a solution contain-

ing 0000001 gram pyridine in 100 c.c. distilled water no longer showed an actual gap
in the spectrnm, there was a perceptible weakening of the lines of that portion of the
spectrum in which the band of ordinary aqueous ammonia occurs.

fore, that the strong ammonia used (35 per cent. NH3) contains approxi-

mately '000 14 per cent, pyridine.
     Although pyridine is thus shown to be the principal cause of the ab-

sorption, minute traces of its higher homologues and of volatile bases of
other series are also probably present, as the slight differences between
the spectrum of ordinary ammonia and that of pure pyridine appear to

indicate.

Methylamine was investigated by Hartley and Huntington in cells

50 mm. thick. 1

An aqueous solution of methylamine was converted into hydrochloride

Aand the salt purified by repeated recrystallisation.     layer ]50 mm.

thick of a solution containing 25 grams of methylamine as hydrochloride

in 100 c.c. distilled water showed practically no absorption. There was

a slight weakening of the spectrum towards the ultra-violet end, and

one or two of the lines at the extreme end of the ultra-violet were

cut off.

                 Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride.

The hydroxylamine hydrochloride examined was subjected to re-

peated recrystallisation. It gave no precipitate with platinic chloride

in presence of alcohol and ether, and it was therefore assumed to con-

tain no ammonium chloride. The salt is highly diactinic and shows no trace

Aof selective absorption.  layer 150 mm, thick of the solution containing

5 grams of hydroxylamine in 100 c.c. water gives a continuous spectrum

Ato ^ l\ 4125 (A. 242*).  layer of the same thickness containing 2' 5 grams

few of the lines at the extreme end of the ultra-violet.

                 Acetaldoxime,CR.,-CYi.-:^-Oll.

Acetaldoxime was prepared in the usual manner by the action of alde-

hyde ammonia on hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and afterwards purified

by fractional distillation until the boiling point was constant : it boiled at

114-115°. In solution this compound shows no selective absorption, but

Avery considerable general absorption.       layer 150 mm. thick of a solu-

tion containing 125 grams of acetaldoxime in 100 c.c. water absorbs all

Alines beyond '/A. 3323 (\ 3009).  layer 25 mm. thick of a solution con-

taining 1 milligram-mol. in 20 c.c. water gives a continuous spectrum to

'/A 3952 (\ 2530), and a layer 1 mm. thick of the same solution shows a

continuous spectrum to '/'^ 4417 (A. 2264).

                 Acetoxime, (CII^)P:^-0YL.

Acetoxime was prepared in the usual manner by the action of hydrox-

ylamine hydrochloride on acetone, and was purified by repeated recrys-

tallisation from water : it melted at SO-GO"^.

Like acetaldoxime, acetoxime shows no selective absorption, but

general absorption, which is slightly greater than in the case of the

former substance, as was to be anticipated from the presence of an

Aadditional methyl group.  layer 25 mm. thick of a solution of ace-

to ^/\ 388G (\ 2573) ; a layer 1 mm. thick of the same solution to

'//\ 4125 (\ 2424).
     The substances above referred to aflford an excellent illustration of

the intimate relation between the character and extent of absorption

and the constitution of an organic compound. Ammonia is highly

diactinic. The substitution of a methyl group for one of the hydrogen
atoms has the effect merely of very slightly increasing the amount of
continuous absorption of the most refrangible rays. Again, the sub-

stitution of hydroxyl for hydrogen has a similar effect, the group OH,

however, haviiig a greater absorptive power than the group CH3,

When we come to acetaldoxime and acetoxime, we find that, regarding

them as derivatives of hydroxylamine, the introduction of the more
complicated groups -.CH'CHa and :C(CH3)2 respectively for the two
remaining hydrogen atoms of the original ammoiiia molecule, is
accompanied by a great increase in the amount of the general absorption.
Comparing, liowever, acetaldoxime with acetoxime, the latter, which
differs from the former in tlie possession of an additional methyl group,
shows only slightly greater absorption. This is in harmony with previous

observations on COgH groups, and the slightly increased absorption

caused by the introduction of methyl groups for hydrogen atoms ; also the
stronger absorption caused by the replacement of hydrogen atoms by

hydroxyl radicles.

   A diagram drawn to a scale of oscillation frequencies shows at a

glance the length of spectrum transmitted by these substances in different
proportions, and through different thicknesses.

If these formulae correctly represent the constitution of the two forms of
benzaldoxime and their relation to one another, we should expect both

compounds, as stereo-isomerides, to exhibit the same character and

amount of absorption. As a matter of fact, we have found that the

curves of the molecular vibi'ations of the two substances in ethereal

Asolution are identical.  layer 25 mm. thick of a solution of either form

of the aldoxime containing 1 milligram-mol. dissolved in 100 c. c. of abso-

     These results, which are shown in the above curve, confirm the

conclusion previously arrived at, that stereo-isomerides, unlike isomerides

which differ in structure, give identical absorption spectra.

                                                 Dlmetliylpyra-inc.

    In a previous report ^ we gave the results of the examination of the
absorption spectra of thiophen, pyrrole, furfuran, and some of the more
important furfuran derivatives. Each of these compounds contains

two pairs of carbon atoms doubly linked, the chain being closed by a

polyvalent element other than carbon. No trace of selective absorption,

such as is shown by benzene, pyridine, and many of their derivatives,

oould be detected in the spectra of any of these substances.

   We have now extended our investigation to 2 : 5-dimethylpyrazine,

a substance in which not merely one carbon is replaced by nitrogen in the
benzene ring, as in pyridine, but two. It thus belongs to a group not
previously examined.

     From the analogy between the constitution of this substance and tliat
of pyridine, it was anticipated that it would show a marked selective
absorption, and this anticipation proved to be correct. One of the

principal reasons for examining a substance of this constitution lay in the
fact that whilst pyridine contains the group ·C:N- once in the benzene
structure, dimethylpyrazine contains it twice, and the orginal formula

proposed for cyanuric acid '' contains it three times. Accordingly, if this

formula were correct for cyanuric acid and its esters, we should expect
that they would exhibit a powerful absorption band, more intense than

that of pyrazine, just as that of pyrazine is more intense than tliat of
pyridine. But it has been concluded, from a widely extended experience
of the behaviour of such substances under the ultra-violet rays, and
particularly from the results of a recent examination of the absorption

spectra of its derivatives,'' that cyanuric acid does not possess this

structure, but one in which the acid is represented by a ring composed of

to be expected, diketohexamethylene, in which the six carbon atoms are

united with each other by a single bond, as in hexachlorobenzene and

piperidine, likewise showed no bands in the spectrum.

Thi-ough the kindness of Professor Sydney Young and Miss Fortey,

we have recently been enabled to examine a specimen of pure hexamethy-

lene prepared from Galician petroleum. This substance, in comparison

Awith benzene and pyridine, is highly diactinic.                                    layer, 60 mm. thick,

of a solution containing 1 mill.-mol. dissolved in 20 c.c. of alcohol, trans-

mits all rays up to ^ /\ 3920, whilst a layer of the same solution, 10 mm.

thick, transmits practically the whole spectrum. In none of the photo-

graphs of the spectra of this substance could any trace of a banded struc-

ture be detected.

  --Tetrahydrohenzene. Professor Young and Miss Fortey were also good

enough to place a specimen of pure tetrahydrobenzene in our hands for

examination. This substance exhibits somewhat greater general absorp-

tion than hexamethylene, a layer, 60 mm. thick, of a solution containing

1 mill.-mol. in 20 c.c. alcohol absorbing all rays beyond '/\ 3694, while

absorption is still traceable in a layer of the same solution 1 mm. thick.

Like hexamethylene, tetrahydrobenzene shows no selective absorption.

The examination of these two substances thus confirms the conclusion pre-

     The first investigation of albuminoids of animal origin was made by
Soret : it included albumen, white of egg, pure albumen, caseine, and

serine. Absorption bands occur in their spectra in the following posi-

--tions : Albumen (white of egg) X 2880-2650, pure albumen X 2948-

2572, caseine A 2948-2572. Serine exhibits a band similar to that of

caseine.

absorption bands. It is evident, therefore, that the constitution of

albumen, caseine, and serine is very different from that of invertase,

diastase, gelatine, starch, glucose, and saccharose.

     This was of interest in connection with C. V. Naegeli's theory of
fermentation. Naegeli regarded fermentation as a process in which a
ti'ansference takes place to fermentable matter of the molecular or rather

intramolecular vibrations of the constituent substances entering into the

composition of living protoplasm whereby the equilibrium of the molecules
of the fermentable matter became so disturbed as to cause their resolution
into simpler molecules. It appears by no means improbable that the

diastatic ferments may have some such action. From this point of view

it does not appear likely that a substance of the character of albumen,

vyhose mode of vibration, as shown by its absorption spectrum, differs

widely from that of the carbohydrates, could affect the latter, while on
the other hand it is possible that the intramolecular vibrations of inver-
tase and diastase might be communicated to saccharose and stai-ch. That
the sugars are highly diactinic substances is quite in character with what

we know of their constitution and of the spectra of similarly constituted

substances.

     It is of interest to learn that the albuminoid compounds associated
with the carbohydrates are evidently different in constitution from those
forms of albumen found in the animal organism. The probability pre-
sents itself of these albuminoids being derived from the carbohydrates.

--Isomorplious Derivatives of Benzem. Report of the Committee, con-'

    sisting of Professor H. A. MiERS (Chairman), Dr. W. P. Wynne.

     and Dr. H. E. Armstrong (Secretary). {Vraivn up hij the Secre-

        tary.)

The existence of morphotropic relationships between the crystalline

forms of substances which are not isomorphous in the formal sense of the

term has of recent years acquired new importance, the purely geometrical
work of Barlow ' and others having demonstrated the superfluity of the

old view that the units of the crystalline structure are polymerides of the
chemically active fundamental molecule as a means of explaining poly-
morphism and kindred crystallographic phenomena, whilst Fock - has
shown, from the study of the partition coefficients of two isomorphous
substances in equilibrium in a liquid and a solid solution in contact, that
in the case of salts, at all events, the molecular weight in the crystalline

state may be that of the fundamental molecule. Moreover the work of

Paterno ·' and others on the cryoscopic behaviour of substances jjossessing
constitutions similar to that of the solvent indicates with certainty that
isumorphism and morphotropy are phenomena which merge gradually one

into the other.

     The consideration of facts such as these leads to the conclusion that
moi'photropy and isomorphism have a common cause, and that this is
more likely to be discovered by the crystallographic study of substances
showing morphotropic relationships than from the examination jnerely of

materials likely to exhibit isomorphism.

     The benzene series offers exceptional oppoi-tunities for the study of

such questions ; indeed, it is remarkable that the publication of Groth's
important memoir,"' calling attention to the existence of morphotropic
relationships between benzene derivatives, has not acted as an incentive
to really systematic work on the subject.

     The two investigations to be referred to form part of a series which are
being carried on in the chemical department of the Central Technical
College, South Kensington, in order, as far as possible, to determine the
effect on the crystalline form of certain definite changes in the composi-
tion. The work will include the determination of the molecular volumes

     In order to determine the morphotropic effect of substitution upon
the crystalline form of formaniUde the simple anilides of the composi-

tion C,-,H,.NH (CO.X) (X=H, Me, Et, Pr, &c.) as well as several of

their alkyl derivatives, and also a number of the mono- and di-halogen
derivatives, have been crystallographically examined by Mr. L. P. Wilson

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

a list of the compounds measured is given in the accompanying table, in
which the geometrical constants are also indicated. It is evident that a
jDrogressive change in the structural dimensions occurs as each series is
traversed, although in most cases this only becomes obvious on rearranging
the axial ratios, and sometimes on taking simple multiples of the ratios.

throughout the series than in the case in series 1. In series 3, obtained by

displacing the acidic hydrogen atom in parabromoformanilide by either

Me or Et, the ratio a 'h again shows approximate constancy. No simple

relationship is observable between parabromacetanilide and its methyl or

ethyl derivative.  Parabrom-  and  paraiod-acetanilide  are  isomorphous
                                                                                                                  ;

the corresponding chloro-derivative is not isomorphous with them, although

it bears a marked morphotropic relationship to them.^ Group 6 forms a

well-marked isomorphous series.

Otten - has observed that butyranilide is dimorphous, but has not

examined the substance in great detail ; a study of this compound has

shown that the dimorphism is of a very remarkable character. At

ordinary temperatures the anilide sepai-ates from alcoholic solutions in

large transpai-ent crystals of pyramidal habit, which are distinctly

orthorhombic, showing a characteristically orthorhombic interference

figure of small optic axial angle. The axial ratios of such crystals are

a : b : c=0-6920 : 1 : 0-6792. On preserving crystals which had been

measured at a constant temperature of 8° to 11° they have been found to

change gradually, and in the course of three months completely, into

tetragonal crystals, without at the .same time losing their brilliancy and

transparency. The axial ratio a ; c=0-6652 : 1 in these crystals ; they

exhibit the characteristic uniaxial interference figure. On preserving the

definitely tetragonal material at OO" for eighty days the reverse change

occurs, the crystals becoming orthorhombic and biaxial, although the

axial ratios never revert to quite their original values. The density of

the orthorhombic form is 1-130, whilst that of the tetragonal form is 1-139.

The molecular volumes of several of the anilides have been determined,

with the object of examining the relations between the topic axial ratios

of Muthmann ; ^ the ordinary axial ratios seem, however, in most cases to

express the morphotropic relationships just as clearly as the topic ratios.

Iso- and Poly-vior^yhous substituted Benzene-sulphonic Chlorides and Bromides.

It has already been stated ·* that the sulphonic chlorides and bromides

1:3:4derived fi-om the        dihalogen-benzene-sulphonic acids together

form an isotrimorphous series. Dr. Jee's further study of this group has

led to important results. The series includes anorthic, orthorhombic, and

monosymmetric terms, in the manner shown in the following table :--

Orientation
170 REPORT-- 1900.

Of these eight substances, three are stable in the anorthic system,

three in the orthorhombic system, and two in the monosymmetric system.
Change of the one form into the other has been observed in four cases

(ly-, V"., VII., VIII.) on allowing the fused substance to cool on a

microscopic slide ; the direction of the change in each case is indicated in
Athe table by an arrow.
                         labile anorthic crystalline form of dibromo-

benzene-sulphobromide (IV.) has been obtained from solution ; and it has
been found that each of the four sulphochlorides (V.-VIII.) can be caused

to crystallise in the alternative system by admixture with a sulphochloride

which usually separates in that system. It has been possible to determine

the symmetry of all the forms referred to in the table by crystallographic

measui'ement, with the single exception of the labile anorthic form of

dibromo-benzene-sulphochloride, but the existence of this form is indicated
by the dimorphous change which occurs on cooling from the melting point

to the atmospheric temperatui-e.

   --The detailed study of such a series of isoraorphs especially of the

melting points of mixtures and of the conditions which determine the

--separation of the various crystalline forms will be of importance, as it is

likely to furnish informatioia of value in discussing the phenomena pre-

sented by igneous rocks containing isomorphous minerals.

The investigation has been extended by Dr. Jee to the corre-

sponding derivatives of the 1:3:5 dihalogen-bens^enesulphonic acids.

The results obtained indicate the existence of an isodimorphous series

1:3:4having no apparent similarity v.dth the  series. One of the
-- --members of this new series 1 : 3 : 5 dibromo-benzene-sulphobromide has

been obtained in two distinct crystallographic forms, both belonging to

the monosymmetric system. At atmospheric temperature one of these

forms is labile and isomorphous with the corresponding sulpho-chloride,

and with 1:3:5 bromo-chlorobenzene-sulphochloride. The stal^le form
1:3:5of dibromo-benzene-sulphobromide, on the other liand, is iso-

morphous with 1:3:5 bromo-chlorobenzene-sulphobroraide. The deriva-

tives of the symmetrical dichloro-acid have not yet been satisfactorily

measured.

Even in their present incomplete form these results are of considerable

importance as showing the manner in which the occurrence of polymor-
phism may render obscure otherwise well-marked isomorphous or morpho-

tropic relationships. Apparently a substance may crystallise in a whole

series of different forms. A, B, C, D, the particular form obtained under

ordinary conditions being the form stable at the temperature at which the

crystals are grown. Another substance, the immediate homologue of the

first in an isomorphous series, can also assume crystalline forms corre-

sponding with A, B, C, D, etc., but the particular form stable at ordinary

temperatures will not be the same as before, owing to the non-corre-

spondence of the transition temperatures. Consequently the first member

of an isomorphous series may crystallise in a form of type A, the second
member in a form of type B, the third of type C, and so on, the

isopolymorphism completely masking the isomorphism.

--The Electrolytic Methods of Quantitative Analysis Sixth Report of the

     Committee, consisting of Professor J. Emerson Reynolds {Chair-

    man), Dr. 0. A. KoHN (Secretary), Professor P. Frankland, Pro-
    fessor F. Clowes, Dr. Hugh Marshall, Mr. A. E. Fletcher,
    and Professor W. Carleton Williams.

The work of the Committee, appointed in 1894, has hitherto included a

complete bibliography on electrolytic analysis up to the end of 1894 and
experimental investigations on the electrolytic determination of antimony,
bismuth, cobalt, nickel, zinc, and the separation of antimony and tin.

     The present report deals with further work on the determination of
bismuth, and with the determination of iron, its separation from man-
ganese, and the application of the electrolytic method to the determination

of iron in organic products.

     These experiments cover some of the most important applications of
electrolytic analysis which required further investigation, and the
Committee propose to conclude their work with the present report.

     The more recent bibliography of the subject has been summarised by
Neumann.^ The Committee would also refer to Neumann's book on
electrolytic analysis,'^ which has been issued since their bibliographical
report, and an English translation of which has been prepared by
Kershaw ; ^ also to the annual reports on electrolytic analysis published

in the ' Jahrbuch fiir Electrochemie.'

The Determination of Bismuth {Part II.) By Professor J. Emerson
         Reynolds, D.Hc, M.D., F.B.S., and W. C. Ramsden.

In a previous report (1896) it was shown :

     1. That carefully spun platinum dishes were better suited for use
as negative electrodes than any other of the various forms experimented

with.

2. That iri-egular results only could be obtained with simple bismuth-

nitrate solutions containing varying  proportions  of  free  nitric acid                                                           but
                                                                                                                                ;

that good determinations were more easily made in solutions of the

sulphate when electrolysed by currents beginning at 0-08 and finishing

at not more than 0'2 ampere.
     .3. That the best results were obtained in presence of metaphosphoi-ic

acid and of citric acid, both of which controlled deposition in a very

marked manner.
     4. That citric acid is quite as effective as metaphosplioric acid and

possesses the additional advantage that the metal can also be separated in

satisfactory condition from ammoniacal solutions of the citrate.

    Two questions i-emained for consideration, viz. {a) the separation of

bismuth from strong but simple solutions, and (b) from solutions con-

tainin'go other metals.

The work under the tirst head was in progress at the time the former

part of the report was published by one of the present writers and Mr.

Bailey, and was subsequently carried as far as seemed desirable. The

results obtained with moderately strong solutions of bismuth were very

unsatisfactory, even in presence of much citric acid and when treated

Wewith all the care indicated by our former experience.  then proceeded

to detei-mine the major limit of concentration at which good determina-

tions can be made.
     Taking 150 c.c. as the most convenient volume for use in the electro-

lytic capsules employed, we found that excellent results could be obtained

in presence of 2-5 gr. of citric acid, so long as the weight of metal in

150 c.c. did not exceed 0'22 gr. With stronger solutions we failed to
obtain satisfactory reguline deposits, even when the proportion of citric
acid was increased and the current at the commencement of the operation

was reduced to 0'005 ampere, so that the rate of deposition should be very

slow.

     AVe therefore arrived at the conclusion that 150 c.c. of bismuth solution
should not contain more than about 0-22 gr. of metal in the form of
nitrate or sulphate, and that 2-5 to 3-0 gr. of pure citric acid suffice
to control the deposition, provided the initial current used and acting for
some hours be about 0-01 ampere, increased at the end, and for a short

time, to 0-15 or 02 ampere.

                               Scjiaraiiun uf Bismuth fro)n other Metals.

     Extended experience in the electrolytic determination of bismuth in
simple solutions of varying strength led us to doubt that the purely
electrolytic separation of the element from other metals would prove satis-
factory. The results obtained by the present writers have justified this

anticipation.

     The least unfavourable determinations of bismuth in such ndxtures
with other metals as would probably be met with in practice were those
obtained with cadmium and zinc ; but even in these theoretically favour-
able cases it was found that, however feeble the currents used, the deposited
bismuth carried down sensible amounts of the much more positive metals.
The method of experimenting was as follows :

   A carefully measured volume of a bismuth-nitrate solution known to

contain 6-018 gr. of metal per litre, in the form of nitrate, was placed
in a platinum capsule. The special treatment to be applied in each case
was then carried out pure citric acid added, the solution diluted with

                                                                                                    ;

water to about 150 c.c, and a current passed through the liquid of such
strength (generally 0-01 ampere) as to secure a good reguline deposit of
bismuth. The whole of the metal was seldom separated under fifteen to
twenty hours, and was hastened at the end by passing a current of about
0-1 ampere for a short time. The contents of the capsule were then washed
with water and alcohol, and the vessel dried and weighed.

      Of the experiments recorded below, the first three aimed at fixing the
degree of accuracy with which bismuth could be electrolytically separated
from the particular simple nitrate solution used in presence of citric acid.
The citric acid used in work of this kind should be tested for lead, &c.,
before use, as samples are sometimes met with which contain metallic
impurities. The total volume of liquid used was the same in these as in all

other cases, viz. about 150 c.c.

    +Expenment A. 0'2407 gr. of bismuth in solution ?> gr. of citric acid

gave after eighteen hours a fairly firm reguline deposit, which weighed
0-2382 gr.

     Experiment B. 0'1805 gr. of bismuth gave under the same conditions
a perfectly firm deposit weighing 0'1807 gr.

     Experiment C. 0'1805 gr. of bismuth with 2'5 gr. of citric acid gave
an excellent deposit of 0-1804 gr.

   AThe concentration of the solution in experiment was too high, as

already pointed out ; but the results obtained in the weaker solutions used

in B and C were as good as could lie obtained in any determinations of

this class.

     The effect of the addition of sulphuric acid is shown in the next three

experiments.
     Experiment D. 0'1805 gr. of bismuth in solution with 0"5 c.c. of pure

freshly distilled HoSO^ and 2 gr. of citric acid gave, after twenty hours, as
good a deposit as in B, and weighed 0"1807 gr.

     Experiment E. 0'1805 gr. bismuth with the same volume of H.jSOj,
but with 4 gr. of citric acid. The metal came down very slowly from
solution, but in good condition, even when a stronger current was used
for a longer time than usual : at the end the weight obtained; after
twenty-six hours, was 0'1801 gr. The proportion of citric acid used was

therefore needlessly large.

     Experiment F. 0']504 gr. of bismuth in solution, 1 c.c. of H^SO^ and

2 gr. of citric acid gave a good deposit, which weighed 0-1507 gr.

     Therefore good results can be obtained in presence of much more free

sulphuric and nitric acids than would probably be present in actual
analysis, or could be separated from mixed sulphates.

     In the remaining tests cadmium or zinc salts were present.
     Experiment G. 02106 gr. of bismuth in solution, 1 c.c. of 11,80^, 2 gr.
of citric acid, and 0-125 gr. of cadmium in the form of sulphate. Result :
0-2687 gr. The deposit easily oxidised and contained some cadmium,
though the current was kept as low as possible throughout.
     Experiment H. 0-2106 gr. of bismuth in solution, in all respects as last,
gave 0-2986 gr. of deposit containing cadmium.
     Experiment I. 0-1805 gr. of bismuth as last, except that only 0-5 c.c.
of H2SO4 was added, gave a fair deposit, but contained cadmium and

weighed 0-2096 gr.
     Experiment J. 0-1925 gr. bismuth ; treated solution as last, but with

4 gr, of citric acid, gave 02340 gr. deposit, easily oxidised as in the other
cases, and cadmium was found in the film.

     The results with zinc were similar ; for example :
     Experiment K. 0-1504 gr. bismuth; the solution containing zinc in
the form of sulphate instead of cadmium, O'S c.c. H2SO4 and 2 gr. of
citric acid. The metal separated in fair condition, but was easily oxidised

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

it weighed 0-1642 gr. and contained traces of zinc.
     Experiment L. 0'1805 gr. bismuth as last, and with zinc sulphate, gave

0-1851 gr., and contained zinc also.

     Therefore, while bismuth can be determined electrolytically with
accuracy in simple and dilute solutions containing citric acid, and even

relatively large proportions of free nitric and sulphuric acidc, we are
unable to recommend its electrolytic separation from any of the metals
with which we have experimented.
174 REPORT-- 1900.

     Tlie best course, in our opinion, is to separate the bismuth' by any of
the well-known methods in the form of hydroxide, to dissolve the latter
in sufficient nitric acid, and, after necessary dilution with addition of citric
acid, to electrolyse, with the precautions already described.

    The Determination of Iron. ^,y Charles A. Kohn, M.Sc, Ph.D.

     ON THE ELECTROLYTIC METHODS OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. ] /)

     The electrolytic metliods for the determination of iron can in no way

be regarded as comparable with the usual volumetric and gravimetric
methods in their general applicability. Under special circumstances, how-

ever, they may be found advantageous, especially in the determination of

relatively small quantities of iron in organic products, an application
which has been specially studied in the subjoined experiments.

     Of the various methods proposed, that in which the metal is deposited

from a solution of the double ammonium oxalate, first suggested by

Parodi and Mascazzini, and subsequently worked out by Classen, is the

most reliable. When separated from a citrate or tartrate solution, the

precipitated iron contains a considerable proportion of carbon, and the

deposition from phosphoric acid or ammonium pyrophosphate solution is

too slow to be of practical value ; further, it necessitates a high current
density, and the introduction of phosphates into the solution is an obvious
disadvantage from an analytical standpoint.

     The experiments have therefore been restricted to the investigation of

the deposition of iron from the solution of the double ammonium oxalate.
They may be conveniently grouped under the following heads]:

     1. The condifAons under ivJnch iron is deposited from ammonium oxa-
late solutioii and the inost favourahle conditions for its electrolytic deter-

mination.

    2. The influence of ammonium chloride on the electrolytic determina-

tion of iron.

     3. The comjilete separation of the iron when deposited from ammonium,
oxalate solution : the sulphocyanide reaction for iron under the conditions

of the experiments.

    4. The presence of carbon in iron deposited from ammonium oxalate
solution and the determination of its amount.

    5. The electrolytic separation of iron and manganese in ammonium oxa-

late solution.

     6. The electrolytic determination of iron in urine and other animal pro-

ducts.

Classen recommends the addition of 6 to 8 gr. of ammonium oxalate

per gr. of iron in 150-175 c.c. of solution, and conducts the electrolysis

with a CD., 00 of 1-0 to 1-5 ampere and 3 to 4 volts in a warm solution

(40''-60° C). Nitrates, if present, must be removed by repeated evapora-

tion with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid ; free sulphuric acid can be

neutralised by ammonium hydrate ; any free hydrochloric acid is prefer-

ably removed by evaporation on the water-bath. The complete deposition

     In a later paper Classen states that the most favourable condition for

the deposition of iron is with a current N.D.,o,,=l-5 ampere at the ordi-

nary temperature. Neumann ' adds that weaker currents (0-3 to 05 ampere)

can be used, but then a larger proportion of ammonium oxalate must be

added and the current increased to 1-0 ampere at the end of the determina-
tion to ensure the precipitation of the last portion of the iron. According

to Wolman, eight to ten hours ai-e necessary for the deposition of 0' 15 to
0-30 gr. of iron with a C.D.,no=0"3 to 1-0, and finally to 1'5 ampere, and
an E.M.F. of 4 volts at 50° C. The majority of the results recorded by
this method are slightly low, on an average 0-2 to 0-6 per cent, on the

weight of iron taken.

    Variations in current and in the proportion of ammonium oxalate

added constitute the only real differences in the conditions of deposition

recommended, and they bear on the one practical difficulty of the method

the prevention of the separation of any ferric hydrate during the electro-

lysis. As pointed out in a previous report (1896) on the electrolytic de-

termination of tin in ammonium oxalate solution, the electrolyte gradually

becomes alkaline, owing to the decomposition of the oxalate and the for-

mation of ammonium carbonate ; in jiresence of a sufficient excess of

ammonium oxalate the iron will still remain in solution after the latter is

alkaline, but otherwise ferric hydrate separates out and oxalic acid must

be added from time to time during the electrolysis to redissolve it. Such

addition of oxalic acid renders it  necessary  to  watch  the  experiment                                                a
                                                                                                                      ;

further drawback is that the quantity of ammonium oxalate solution

necessai-y leaves little room for any further addition of liquid in an ordi-

nary dish of 175 c.c. to 200 c.c. capacity. Hence the ammonium oxalate

must outlast the deposition of the iron if an addition of oxalic acid is to be

Aavoided.  series of experiments were, therefore, first arranged in which

the time necessary for the solution to become alkaline, the propoi'tion of

metal deposited up to alkaline reaction, and the proportion subsequently

deposited, were noted.

   A ferric chloride solution of known strength was used, made up from

--pure ferric oxide, the method of working being as follows : The slight

excess of hydrochloric acid in the measured portion of the solution was

first neutralised with a few drops of ammonium hydrate, oxalic acid
solution added to acid reaction, and the whole then added to the ammonium
oxalate solution. The additional oxalic acid recorded was either added to

the original solution or at intervals during the electrolysis. The current
density, C.D.ino=l"0 to 1-5 ampere, and electromotive force of 3-5 to 4-0
volts employed in these first experiments are the values hitherto regarded

as the most favourable for the deposition of iron. Both warm and cold
solutions were tried. The ammonium oxalate solution contained 40 gr.

per 1.000 c.c. ; the oxalic acid solution 80 gr. per 1,000 c.c.
     Platinum dishes of about 200 c.c. capacity were used as the cathode

and bored platinum discs as the anode ; the circuits and measurements

were arranged as described in the Committee's third report (1896).
     The following results illustrate the conclusions to be drawn from this

series of experiments :

                         Series I.

     In experiments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 10 c.c. of oxalic acid solution were added
to the solution prepared as stated above and the electrolysis continued
until the mixture became alkaline, when the current was broken and the

deposited metal washed, dried, and weighed in the usual manner. The
solution became alkaline very quickly when electrolysed warm, but on an
average about 25 per cent, of the total iron was deposited in this short

pei'iod of fifteen to twenty minutes. Although alkaline, no separation of

ferric hydrate took place up to this stage, there being sufficient ammonium

oxalate left to keep the iron salt in solution. In experiments 6 and 7
a larger proportion of oxalic acid solution (50 c.c.) was added to the

Horiginal solution, which allowed the electrolysis to be continued for
     hour before alkalinity was reached ; the rate of deposition is evidently

slowed by this increase of free acid. When cold solutions are electrolysed

the deposition is quicker, as shown in experiments 8 and 9 ; the larger pro-
portion of metal deposited is also partly due to the somewhat higher
current and E.M.F. employed, and, taking this into account, the solution
takes longer to get alkaline when electrolysed cold, as would be expected,

Asince the rate of the decomposition of the oxalate will be slower.

comparison of experiments 5 and 8 with the remainder shows that,
with less iron and the same proportion of oxalate, there is an increase

in the proportion of iron deposited, despite the retarding effect of the

                                                                                      !

is done, accurate results can be obtained, our own determinations, which
need not be detailed here, confirming those of previous experimenters. The
continuous attention thus entailed of course robs the method of its

practical value.

    Experiments were made on the use of acid ammonium oxalate instead

of the neutral salt as the electrolyte, and it was found possible to complete
the electrolysis without the addition of oxalic acid, 6 gr. of the acid salt
being added to Q-l gr. of iron as ferric chloride. But there is always a
risk of ferrous oxalate separating out from this solution after the ferric
salt has been reduced, which is extremely difficult to redissolve, so that the
conditions of deposition were not regarded as worth further study.

    By working with a lower current density and allowing the electrolysis
to proceed for six hours, or preferably ovei-night, in cold solutions, it was
found that 5 gr. of ammonium oxalate will outlast the deposition of

0-2 gr. of iron, and these conditions afford a thoroughly satisfactoiy
method for the electrolytic determination of iron. The metal is deposited in
a steel -grey, coherent form, and adheres equally well to a polished or sand-
blasted dish ; the washing and drying can be done without any fear of

o.\.idation.

     After some preliminary experiments it was found that a C.D.mg of
0*4 to 0-5 ampere and anE.M.F. of 3-0 to 3'5 volts are best ; from five to
six hours are necessary for the deposition of 0-1 gr. of ii'on. The following
experiments illustrate the results to be obtained under these conditions

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

Since any iron solution in the ordinary course of analysis is likely to be

acid with hydrochloric acid, a few experiments were made to decide whether

the ammonium chloride formed by neutralising it has any deterrent effect

on the deposition of the metal, since Classen states that it is desirable to

remove free hydrochloric acid by evaporation previous to the electrolysis.

1 gr. of ammonium chloride was added to each of the solutions electrolysed

under                                     the conditions tabulated below                                                                                                                    from the results it  is evident that
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the addition is without influence on the determination of the iron.

= 1-0 ampere, an E.M.F. of 2-5 to 3-0 volts, and the addition of 8 gv. of

ammonium oxalate for 0-1 to 0-3 gr. of iron. From the contradictory

nature of these results it became important to ascertain whether the

accuracy of our own determinations was really due to small compensating

errors.

     To test the complete deposition of the iron in the experiments in
Series II. (p. 178) a small quantity of the solution was withdrawn by a
capillary tube, and tested with potassium sulphocyanide after acidifying
with hydrochloric acid. The reaction is, however, known to be inhibited
by the presence of organic acids, such as oxalic, unless a large excess of

hydrochloric acid is present to prevent the dissociation of the ferric

sulphocyanide ; this addition may so far dilute the solution as to prevent

the detection of small quantities of iron. Further, the metal is present

as a ferrous salt at the end of the electrolysis, and this fact may also be a

cause of any iron present escaping detection. The delicacy of the sulpho-
cyanide reaction was, therefore, carefully studied under the conditions of

the electrolytic experiments, as well as in presence of ammonium oxalate
and of oxalic acid. Our results show that whilst up to 0-4 mgr. of iron
can readily escape detection when the test is made by the usual method

of withdrawing only a little of the solution, 0-1 mgr. can always be
detected with certainty if the whole of the solution, after electrolysis, is
tested by acidifying with 75 c.c. of hydrochloric acid (cone), and then
adding lO c.c. of a 20 per cent, solution of potassium sulphocyanide.

The coloration is quite distinct in presence of ammonium oxalate, oxalic
acid, ammonium chloride, or of the salts remaining after the electrolysis

of the mixture of these salts as used in the deposition of iron under the
conditions of the experiments in Series II. The sequence of the addition

of the reagents in no way affects the delicacy of the reaction, nor is the
addition of any oxidising agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, necessary to
convert the ferrous into ferric iron when solutions containing oxalic acid

or its salts, or the products of their electrolysis, are tested ; in their
presence a little stirring appears ample to completely oxidise small

quantities of iron. As a matter of fact, less than 0-1 mgr. can be

detected thus, but this limit is of course sufficient to check the presence

of iron left in the solution after electrolysis. With this check on the

complete deposition of the metal a series of determinations were made, in
which the iron remaining in solution was determined colorimetrically
by potassium sulphocyanide after the electrolysis.

results showed the presence of 0*2 to 0-3 iiigr. of iron in the electrolysed
solution. Nevertheless, as in the experiments of Series II., the error in
the weight of iron deposited is on the plus side.

4. The Presence of Carbon in Iron deposited from Ammonium Oxalate Solution,
   and the Determination of its Amount. By Charles A. Kohn, M.Sc, Ph.D.,

   and F. J. Beislee.

     To ascertain the presence of carbon in the metal deposited under the

Aabove conditions the following method was adopted :-- solution of ferric

chloride, neutralised with ammonium hydrate, and to which ammonium

oxalate was added, was electrolysed under the usual conditions, a piece of
platinum foil being employed as the cathode. After the electrolysis the
foil was thoroughly washed, then dried, and rolled up for combustion.
The combustion was carried out in an ordinary combustion tube in a
current of oxygen, a solution of barium hydrate being used for the
absorption of the carbon dioxide. In every case a blank experiment was
conducted for one hour before the introduction of the deposited iron, and
the absorption bulbs weighed both at the beginning and end of the blank
experiment ; no difficulty, however, was found in keeping out all traces
of carbon dioxide. The results tabulated below leave no doubt as to the
 presence of carbon in the deposited metal ; the quantity appears to be
 independent of the quantity of iron precipitated, but increases with the

quantity of ammonium oxalate in the solution electrolysed, when this is

 completely decomposed. The results are likely to err on the low side, as
 the combustion of the carbon deposited with the iron is likely to be
incomplete. In order to make sure that the carbon dioxide was not
 derived from any slight residues that might have adhered to the iron from
 the alcohol used in the washing of the deposit, this washing was omitted
 in experiments 3 and 4, and the precipitated metal dried in vacuo after
 washing with water. Further, in experiment 4 the deposited iron, which
 was beautifully crystalline, was detached as far as possible from the
 platinum, and this portion (a) very completely washed with water before
 drying, so as to be certain that the carbon did not arise from any adhering
 traces of the decomposed oxalate solution ; the iron that still remained on
 the platinum was combusted separately (b).

                                                                Series V.

and IV., in which ;") gr. of ammonium oxalate were used, should be

0'7 mgr. too high from this source of error. In the two sets of experi-

ments the values obtained average an excess of 0'2 mgr., and the weight

of metal remaining in solution after the determination is 0'2 to 0"3 mgr.

These compensating errors, therefore, contribute to the apparent accuracy

of  the  method                                  they  are  sufficiently small to  bring  the  process  witliin

the range of practical analysis. This conclusion is in accoi'd with the

experiments recorded by Avery and Dales ; the difference in the Tper-

centage of carbon found is in all probability due to the time of electro-

lysis. It is impossible to reconcile these results with those of Verwer

and Groll ; but that their results, like those obtained by Classen, are low
is undoubtedly to be attributed to the method adopted for testing the

completion of the deposition of iron by means of potassium sulphocyanide.

The origin and direction of the eri'ors arising in the electrolysis of
ammonium oxalate solutions containing iron are clearly shown by our

experiments, and it is unlikely that different conditions prevail when

other metals are present in the same electrolyte. The facts thus esta-

blished must be duly considered in judging of the results obtained by these

methods, especially in such cases as atomic weight determinations.

    The quantities of carbon deposited with the iron were too small to

Weallow of the investigation of its condition of combination.                                  are, how-

ever, inclined to think that it is present as a carbide, for whenever the

deposited metal is dissolved in acid the smell of hydrocarbons can always

be noticed ; also, after the upper layer of the metal has dissolved, the
underlying portion is very often darker in colour and more difficult to

dissolve.

     In the electrolysis of manganese salts in presence of dilute mineral

acids, sodium pyrophosphate, or ammonium oxalate, the manganese is

separated at the anode as hydrated peroxide. This property is of little
value, however, for the determination of manganese itself, because it is
difficult to effect the complete separation of the metal as oxide, and special
conditions must be adopted to cause the precipitate to adhere to the

anode. On the other hand, the difference in the behaviour of iron and
manganese when subjected to electrolysis in ammonium oxalate solution

is attractive as a method for the separation of the two metals.
     The practical difhculty in effecting a separation on these lines is that

the precipitated manganic oxide always carries down some iron with it

this can only be overcome by adopting such conditions of electrolysis that

only one of the metals is separated, the other remaining in solution. By

means of a divided cell Engels states that manganese can be completely

separated as peroxide, using a sulphuric acid solution ; this involves the

subsequent determination of the iron. The chief work on the subject,
however, has aimed at the determination of the iron by deposition on the

cathode, obviously the more useful line of separation.

     According to Classen, the separation is possible if 8 to 10 gr. of

ammonium oxalate are added to the solution of the mixed salts and the
mixture electrolysed warm with a C.D.,(,n of about 1-0 ampere. This

proportion of oxalate is said to outlast the deposition of the iron ; the
manganic oxide does not separate until the mass of the oxalate has been
decomposed, and even with large proportions of manganese only very little

peroxide separates at the anode under these conditions.

Neumann ' and Engels ^ both state that the separation is incomplete, and

Weour own experiments confirm this view.  have not found it possible

to completely deposit iron without a separation of manganese peroxide,

nor to separate the latter free from iron. The presence of even small

proportions of manganese has, moreover, quite a remarkable effect in

hastening the separation of iron as hydrate in the electrolysis of oxalate

solutions. In some early experiments on the determination of iron the

results were from 3 to 4 per cent, too low, and a separation of hydrate

always took place after about two hours ; on testing the precipitate it
was found to contain manganese, derived from the iron wire used in
making up the solution. In the subsequent work recorded above the

iron was always purified from manganese by precipitation as basic

acetate.

    The following experiments show the extent of the error when the

separation is conducted under the conditions most favourable for the

deposition of the iron. The mixed chlorides of the two metals were

neutralised with ammonium hydrate, 5 gr. of ammonium oxalate added,

and electrolysed as usual. In experiments 4, 5, and 6, a CD. ion of only

0*2 ampere was used ; but still the deposition of the iron was incomplete,

and in all cases manganese peroxide contaminated with iron separated

Aat the anode or remained suspended in the solution.     comparison of

the results tabulated on p. 184 shows that the error in the iron increase?!
with tlie proportion of manganese taken.

 C. The Electrolytic Determination of Iron in Urine and other Animal Products.
           Bij Charles A. Kohn, M.!Sc., Ph.D., and G. C. Clat'xon, Ph.D.

     Iron is the only heavy metal present in the body, and the part it plays
in animal metabolism is of special interest. The varied conditions of its
combinations can as yet only be approached by histochemical reactions

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

for its total and quantitative determination the ordinary volumetric,

gravimetric, or colorimetric methods have been applied. As the

quantities present in certain organs and excreta are extremely small,
special importance attaches to the methods adopted for their estimation.
The usual method of procedure is to dry and ignite the product to
be tested, extract the residue with acid, and determine the iron in
the resulting solution. In the case of urine, for instance, a day's
discharge (about 1,500 c.c.) is evaporated and ignited until the
residual ash is quite white, then dissolved in sulphuric acid and titrated
with a dilute permanganate solution, after reduction with sulphurous
acid (Hamburger ·) or with zinc (Damaskin,-' JoUes ^). Gottlieb and
Ludwig '^ employed a gravimetric method in which the iron is precipi-

tated as Prussian blue in presence of a 1 per cent, zinc chloride solution,
the precipitate subsequently decomposed by alkali, and the resulting ferric
hydrate weighed after separation from the zinc by repeated precipitation

with_ ammonium hydrate. More recently Jolles has recommended the

gravimetric determination of iron in urine by precipitation with nitroso-
fi naphthol.-' The great variations obtained by the adoption of these
methods are shown in the following data as to the quantity of iron present
in a day's discharge of normal urine :

    The values found by Damaskin, Lieber and Mohr, and Kumberg are

usually regarded as the most correct, and 1 mgr. iron per diem in normal
urine is looked upon as the average amount.''

    Two sources of error beset these methods of analysis. In the first

place, the very large quantity of iiaineral salts, especially chlorides and
phosphates, left after ignition has a disturbing influence on the titration
with permanganate, especially with such small proportions of iron as
1 mgr. in the total solution ; secondly, it is impossible to completely
remove the organic matter in the ignition, and its presence in solution

affects the titration to a marked extent. These errors, which are of
necessity irregular in character, are still more serious when gi-avimetric

methods are adopted, whilst they make colorimetric methods altogether

unreliable.

The electrolytic determination of iron presents the important advan-

tage over the above by not being afi'ected by these adverse conditions,

and our results justify the conclusion that it is reliable and accurate.

The presence of phosphoric acid does not interfere with the determination.

Any organic matter present in the solution of the ash can be completely

removed by a preliminary electrolysis in presence of sulphuric acid. This

was proved in a series of experiments in which the attempt was made to

effect the deposition of the metal directly in urine without concentration

and ignition of the resulting ash. In order to overcome the frothing due

to the decomposition of the urea in the urine, during the electrolysis, the

latter was first decomposed with nitrous acid, the details of the method of

determination being as follows : 100 c.c. of urine are treated in a flask with

12 c.c. of sulphuric acid (1:5) and T) gr. of sodium nitrite, and gently
warmed. After the decomposition is complete 5 c.c. of sulphuric acid

(cone.) are added, the solution boiled to complete the decomposition of

the urea, and electrolysed overnight with a C.D.ioq=1"0 ampere. The

urine is completely decolorised by the current, a crystal clear solution

resulting, whilst a deposit of carbon quite free from iron takes place on

the cathode. The solution is then neutralised with ammonium hydrate,

oxalic acid added to acid reaction, then 5 gr. of ammonium oxalate, and

boiled. The precipitated calcium oxalate, which does not retain any of

the iron, is filtered off, washed, and the filtrate electrolysed either atGO^C.

present, is used as the cathode, and a platinum dish of about 200 c.c.

capacity as the anode. The deposited metal, which is quite bright and

metallic in appearance, after being washed, dried, and weighed, can be

dissolved off, and the spiral re-weighed as a check on the determination,

whilst confirmatory qualitative tests can, of course, be made with the
resulting solution. In the following experiments known weights

of iron were added to 100 c.c. of normal mine. (The quantity of metal

Apresent in the urine is negligible, less than 0-1 mgr.)    blank experi-

ment was first made, with all the reagents employed in the method as de-

scribed, to determine the contained iron and to make allowance for the

carbon deposited ; the total amounted to 0-2 mgr., which was deducted in

all cases.

forty-eight hours in presence of sulphuric or nitric acid the decolorisa-

tion is incomplete. This direct method of determination is therefore
inapplicable. The results are recorded to prove that the salts and

organic matter are practically without influence on the deposition of

the iron. The only alternative, therefore, is to evaporate to dryness,

ignite, best after a preliminary drying at 180° C, and then proceed as

above, omitting, of course, the decomposition with nitrous acid. Thus

modified the method loses much of its absolute, but none of its relati\e

chloric acid (cone.) is best for the extraction ; the solution is then con-

centrated to remove hydrochloric acid, and electrolysed to destroy all

traces of organic matter ; it is then ready for treatment with ammonium

oxalate and the final electrolysis as described.

The following results with normal urine were obtained by this

method :

Taking a day's discharge at 1,500 c.c, the average amount of iron per

diem in the above experiments is 091 mgr., a value v/^hich confirms the

most reliable of the results given above.

In all cases in which the determination of very small quantities of

iron in organic products is concerned, the exceptional delicacy of the

electrolytic method, its freedom from the sources of error that arise with

other methods on account of the inherent presence of salts and of organic

matter, and, finally, the ready check on the nature and amount of the

deposited metal, render it capable of giving reliable and comparable

Weresults under all conditions.         have made use of it, with advantage,

not only in the analysis of urine, but also in the determination of iron

in liver, spleen, and fjeces, both under normal and pathogenic conditions.

--The Teaching of Science in Elementary Schools. Report of the Com-

     mittee, consisting of Dr. J. H. Gladstone (Chairman), Professor

    H. E. Armstrong (Secretarij), Lord Avebury, Professor W. E.

     Dunstan, Mr. George Gladstone, Sir Philip Magnus, Sir
     H. E. EoscoE, Professor A. Smithells, and Professor S. P.
     Thompson.

It has been the custom of your Committee to give some comparative
tables derived from the return of the Education Department showing the
relative attention given to the teaching of scientific subjects in elementary

schools for a period of years. By these it has been shown that for the
eight years prior to 1890, during which time English Grammar was an

obligatory subject provided any class subject was taken in the school, and
as the Code allowed only two class subjects to be taken for the purpose of
a grant, it was only in those schools where two of these were taken th^t
--188 REPORT 1900.

science teaching could be given throughout the standards. But the effect
of this was that as the other recognised class subjects were History,
Geography, and Elementary Science, and of these Geography was by far the
most popular amongst the teachers, while English History was adopted in
most other cases, Elementary Science scarcely received any attention at all.
It should be borne in mind, moreover, that up to that date Geography itself
was but little taught from a scientific standpoint, the details of topography

occupying the pupils' time almost to the exclusion of the study of the physics

of our globe. In the year 1889-90 the number of school departments in
which English Grammar was taken amounted to no less than 20,304,
while Elementary Science was taught in only 32. Since that year a free
choice of subjects has been allowed, and the wide discrepancy between
these figui'es has been regularly reduced year by year ; in 1890-91
English dropped to 19,825, while Elementary Science rose to 173 ; and
the table below will show the change that has been going forward since
that date. It will be observed that Object Lessons were introduced in
1895, and these were made obligatory in the three lower standards on
and after September 1, 1896. In the report presented by this Committee
last year it was pointed out that the distinction between Object Lessons
and Elementary Science was one of nomenclature rather than anything
else, and now in the Government return for 1898-99 the distinction in
name has been abolished, and all are included under the term Elementary

Science.

     The number of departments in ' schools for older scholars ' for the year
1898-99 was 23,191, all but two of which took one or more class subjects.
But Histoi-y was taken in 5,879 departments, and needlework (as a class
subject for girls) in 6,952 departments, and sundry minor subjects in

1,034, making, with the other three subjects of the table, a total of 66,232.
This shows an average of nearly three class subjects to each department

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but it must be borne in mind that the same subject is not always taken
in all the standards, in which case three or more class subjects will appear
in the return for a single department. That there has been less splitting up
of the subjects between the upper and lower standards is apparent ; and
also that such a subject as Geography must, in some cases, have been
taught by means of object lessons, as otherwise it would have been found
by this time that the figure for object lessons had equalled the number of

departments, whereas the 21,301 is actually considerably less than that
for the previous year. It can hardly be assumed that under the regula-
tions of the Code there was any actual diminution of such teaching.

      It has been previously remarked that 'the increased teaching of
scientific specific subjects in the higher standards is the natural conse-
quence of the greater attention paid to natural science in the lower part
of the schools,' The following table sho-\YS that such is the actual

schools of different sizes and circumstances ; and in the explanatory

memorandum one of their objects is declared to be ' to make the course

of instruction in all schools more comprehensive, so as to give all scholars

the rudiments of general information, while enabling the details of the

instruction to be adapted to the special needs of various kinds of schools.'

It is added that in all schools both boys and girls ' should learn something

of their own country, and be taught to observe and to acquire for them-

selves some knowledge of the facts of nature. ... In country schools

lessons on the objects and work of country life are valuable that would

be inappropriate in town schools, while in the latter the instruction given

in lessons on Common Things and in Elementary Science should be varied

with reference to the probable future occupations of the children. . . . The

introduction of a wider and more generally interesting course of instruc-

tion will, it is hoped, be a welcome relief from the continued repetition

of the restricted course of lessons, which has a tendency to become lifeless

and wearisome.' As an illustration may be quoted Scheme 5, for a boys'

school in a seaside town, in which the course for ' Elementally Science and

-- ACommon Things ' is thus set out : ' Class V. to III. : course of lessons

Since the issue of the Code for this year the Board of Education have

issued a minute establishing Higher Elementary schools. Higher-grade

schools, as they have usually been called, have grown up in all the large

industrial centres during the last twenty years or so, with the approval of

the Education Department, though questions have been raised as to the

right of School Boards to carry them on. All such doubts would Ije set

aside by working under the minute, which provides for a four-year course,

connnencing at a point equivalent to Standard V., and contemplating a

continuance of study up to fifteen yeai's of age. No definite scheme of

instruction is laid down in the minute, as that is to be regulated by ' the

circumstances of the scholars and the neighbourhood,' and the grants will

be assessed at the higher or lower scale according to ' the thoroughness

and intelligence with which the instruction is given, the sufficiency and

suitability of the staff, the discipline and organisation.' Though there are

some inconvenient restrictions which it may be found necessary to modify,

the effect of this minute should be in the direction advocated by your

Committee.

This, however, will depend absolutely upon the will of the Managers

and the consent of the Board of Education, as the minute only provides

that ' the Managers of any school who desire such school to be recognised

as a Higher Elementary School must submit for the approval of the

Board before July 1 in any year proposals for a curriculum and time table,

and supply such other information as may be required by the Board.' In
contrast to this may be quoted the provisions of the Scotch Code for

--Higher Grade Schools, which include the following : ' Such schools or

departments may give an education which is either predominantly
ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 191

-- --scientific and technical Higher Grade (Science) Schools or predominantly

--commercial Higher Grade (Commercial) Schools, or they may give a course

which is recognised by the Department as specially suited to girls or to

special classes of pupils. In all cases the Department must be satisfied

that the school possesses the proper provision of class rooms, laboratories,

and workshops necessary for the pai'ticular type of education to be given

therein. . . . Pupils following the Higher Grade Science course must

take in addition the following subjects : Mathematics, Experimental

Science, and as a rule some form of Manual Work. . . . In the second year

of the Higher Grade Science course not less than eight, and in the third

year not less than ten, hours a week must, as a rule, be allotted to Science,

and at least half of this time must be spent by the pupils in individual

experimental work. For the purjDose of this article three hours of

Drawing or of Manual Instruction, or of both conjointly, will be reckoned

as equivalent to two hours of Science. In the third and following years

Manual Instruction may be dropped, and the pupil should devote himself

to the study of some special branch of Science.' In Appendix V. it is

further stated : ' The course in Science should proceed from elementary

exercises in measuring and weighing, and calculations based thereon, to

the experimental investigation of elementary notions of Physics and

Chemistry. In rural schools, and in summer, some investigation of plant

life and of the elements of Botany should be added. At least half the

time devoted to this subject should be spent by each pupil in practical

work. . . . The Department must be satisfied that the teachers have a

competent knowledge of the subjects which they are to teach in each

subject individually, and in the case of Science that they have had

experience in treating the subject experimentally.'

In the Reports for 1897 and 1898 your Committee referred to the

improvements which were being effected in the teaching of Science in the

London Board Schools, and to Professor Fitzgerald's advocacy of the

extension of the same system to Ireland. The Commission on Practical

and Manual Instruction, of which he was a membei', reported strongly in

favour of such work, and decided that similar instruction should be given

in schools under the National Board of Education. To this end Mr. Heller

(whose transference from London to Birmingham has been already noted)

has been appointed Organiser of Science Instruction in Irish Schools, and

will take up his new duties as soon as he can be released from the Head-

mastership of the Municipal Technical School of Birmingham. The

syllabuses of specific subjects in the Irish Code are similar to those in the

English Code of regulations. For the present a scheme corresponding to

HCourse of the English Code has been introduced in a slightly modified

form, and notes have been added indicating the spirit in which the

Ainstruction should be given.  training laboratory is being equipped in

Dublin at which selected teachers will be taken through a course of

instruction in heuristic methods, and where they will receive the benefit

of the experience gained in the London schools. The training colleges

not under the control of the National Board are also understood to be

sympathetic, so that there is very good prospect that the Science teaching

in National Schools in Ireland will be energetically developed.

The advance which was noted last year in the work of the Evening

Continuation Schools does not seem to have been maintained, as will be

evident from the following table. Nearly all the subjects show a falling

off", except Elementary Physics and Chemistry, Domestic Science and

former contains two, of its bromine atoms in the hydroxylated ring
-which is proved to be the case by their behaviour on oxidation, the tribro-

--monaphthol melting at 159° being convertible into dibromo-, and that

melting at 155° into bromo-phthalic acid so that in the one case the non-
hydroxylated ring, and in the other the hydroxylated ring, is attacked.

     Unexpected difficulties have been encountered in attempting to deter-
mine the position of the second bromine atom in the hydroxylated nucleus
of the tribromonaphthol melting at 155°. This compound affords a
dibromoquinone isomeric with that produced on decomposing the dibromo-
nitroketo-compound derived from dibromonaphthol. Both these dibromo-

quinones are converted into 1:3:4 bromophthalic acid on oxidation.

Consequently the one contains a bromine atom in position 3, and the other

a bromine atom in position 4. When subjected to the action of aniline,

howevei', both yield the same two anilides.

Nor have results yet been obtained by means of alkalies which afford a

solution of the problem.

     The dibromoquinone obtained from the bromonaphthol melting at 155°
is remarkably sensitive to oxidation, being slowly converted into the
dibromohydroxy- quinone when kept ; a result which appears to favour

the view that bromine is present in the tribromonaphthol in position 3.

The dibromoquinone in question may be recrystallised from ethylic acetate,

but if left too long in contact with the solvent it is converted into an

infusible condensation product. This quinone is therefore a compound

which it will be desirable to study in detail.

The tribromonaphthol melting at 155° is acted on with difficulty by

bromine, remaining for the most part unchanged when its solution in

acetic acid is digested with bromine during thirty to forty hours at 100°

to 120°, only a small portion being converted into the tetrabromonaphthol

melting at 172°, described by Armstrong and Rossiter. The tribromo-

naphthol melting at 159°, under similar conditions, is without difficulty

converted into a tetrabromonaphthol melting at 1 84°, which is convertible

into a tribromoquinone isomeric with that obtainable from the isomeric
Atetrabromonaphthol.
                      third tetrabromonaphthol has been obtained in

small quantity together with that melting at 184° by acting directly on

betanaphthol with dry bromine. It is distinguished by yielding a tetra-

bromonaphthaquinone.

Both tribromonaphthols are easily reduced at 100° by a saturated
ON ISOMERIC NAPHTHALENE DEKIVATIVES.                               299

solution of hydrogen iodide, the bromine atom in position 1 being dis-

placed. Two new dibromonaphthols are thus obtained : that from the

tribromonaphthol melting at 155° melts at 137° to 138°, and that from

the isomeric naphthol melts at 127°. On digesting these dibromonaphthols

with alcohol and sulphuric acid under similar conditions that containing

one of the bromine atoms in the hydroxylated ring yields only about 55,

whilst that containing both bromine atoms in the non-hydroxylated ring

yields about 61 per cent, of ether.

   A comparison of the behaviour of the various chloro- and bromo-

betanaphthols towards hydrogen iodide with their behaviour on etheriti-

cation is of interest as showing that both changes are subject to similar

influences ; they therefore may be discussed from the same point of view.

As the reducing eflPect is confined to the bromine atom contiguous to the
OH OHgroup, this alone being displaced by hydrogen, the
                                                         group must

be supposed to be concei'ned in the change. Probably it exercises an at-

tractive influence, and this influence must be regarded as subject to modi-

fication by every change in the hydrocarbon radicle, so that reduction

takes place less readily just as etherification takes place less readily in the

case of the more fully substituted compounds. The etherification of the

derivatives of betanaphthol has been discussed by Mr. Davis from this

point of view in a paper published in the ' Transactions of the Chemical

Society ' early in the present year (77, 33).

        On the Constitution of Gamphor. By A. Lapworth, B.Sg.

                   [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

The question of the constitution of camphor has occupied the attention
of a large number of chemists for many years, and it still presents oppor-
tunities for much speculation. Recently, however, it has come to be fully

recognised that the earlier writers on the subject were misled by the ease

with which benzenoid compounds could be obtained from many camphor
derivatives, and it is now quite clear that the greatest care must be exer-

cised in attributing special significance to evidence based on observations

of this kind.

     The formation of large quantities of ^j-cymene and carvacrol fi'om cam-
phor by the action of phosphorus pentoxide was the basis of some of these
earlier speculations, and to carry the arguments to their logical conclusion
it would be necessary to make the formulae account for the production of
?u-cymene, which is obtained in considerable amount when zinc chloride

or phosphorus pentasulphide is the agent, ^ and also of 1.2.4. dimethyl
ethyl benzene and 1.2.3.5 tetramethylbenzene.^ The formation of
1.3.4 acetyldimethylbenzeneby the action of sulphuric acid on camphor ^

would also require elucidation.

     It appears natural to suppose that, if we are still unable to discover
with certainty the principles underlying the changes referred to, we

should also be cautious in interpreting the meaning of other transforma-
tions which involve any alteration in the structure of closed rings, and it is

now pretty generally recognised that the divergence of opinion which still
exists with regard to the constitution of the camphor nucleus must be due

to the occurrence of unsuspected intramolecular changes during reactions
which are at present deemed susceptible of only one simple interpretation.

     In the case of a problem of this kind in which a very large amount of
experimental material has to be dealt with, some of which appears to
point conclusively to one view and some in an equally unequivocal manner
to another, it would appear to be the most logical course to sift the
material in such a way that the relative value of the evidence on each
side may be compared, and, if possible, so as to gain a clue as to the exact
points at which the tendency appears to change, so that particular atten-

tion may then be directed to those points.

     In the present communication it is proposed first of all to select from
the material those facts which bear directly on the points at issue,
accepting only those conclusions which no longer reasonably admit of
dispute, and then to discuss the significance of the rest of the evidence
relating to the still undecided question of the ultimate structure of the
camphor molecule.

            A.--GENERAL NATURE OF CAMPHOR.

    Camphor has the formula CjoHmO : it is a ketone, as it yields well-

defined hydrazones, an oxime and a seraicarbazone. It is saturated, and
therefore must be considered to consist of two closed carbon rings, of which
one includes the carbonyl or ketone group ^ CO.

    As it will clearly be of importance to be able to refer to either of these

rings, one will afterwards be termed the ketone ring, and the other the
hydrocarbon ring.

         B.--PROPERTIES AND TRANSFORMATIONS

                       OF THE KETONE RING.

      --1. The Ketone Ring contains the Group CHo.CO

    That the carbonyl group > CO of camphor is in direct attachment to

-- --a methylene group CH^ is proved conclusively by the following

considerations :

(a) Formation of Camphoric Add by the Oxidation of Camphor.

    When camphor is treated with the usual oxidising agents it is con-

verted into camphoric acid, CioH,g04, a saturated, dicarboxylic acid.
This transformation is simply explained only by the assumption that the
change proceeds in accordance with the scheme

(b) Formation and Properties of the siynplest Substitution Derivatices of Camphor.

  --(i) Halogen and Nitro-compounds. Camphor ordinarily yields only

mono- and c?i-substitution derivatives (termed a-derivatives) on treat-
ment with the characteristic substituting agent such as the halogen or
nitric acid, and with aliphatic saturated ketones the position of substitution
is at the carbon atom contiguous to the carboxyl group.
                                                                                           ON THE CONSTITUTION OF CAMPHOR.                                                         301

     The a-mono-halogen derivatives, such as a-monobromocamphor, on
treatment with oxidising agent are converted into camphoric acid

                                                                                           /CHBr                                                /COOH

                                                                                           ^CO ^COOH

     The a- di- derivatives are only oxidised with great difficulty, and on

treatment with alkalis are usually converted into the a-j^oio-derivatives.

Thus when a-bromocamphor is chlorinated it yields a mixture of two stei'eo-

isomeric bromochlorocamphors, both of which are converted into a-chloro-
camphor on treatment with alkali, so that both halogen atoms must be
attached to the same carbon atom '

2. The Relation between Camphor and Camphoric Acid is in

     It has been usual in discussing the relationship between these two
substances to dismiss the subject with a few words, but the point requires
much more careful consideration and proof than it is usually deemed
worthy of, and it cannot be insisted too frequently that in dealing with
the mutations of closed-chain compounds, such as the derivatives of cam-
phor, such transformations should be regarded from all points of view,
especially, as in the present instance, where the evidence derived from the
different fields of work cannot be viewed in its entirety until the point is
decided beyond all doubt.

     In the case in question, fortunately, there is no doubt whatever that
the ordinary view is the correct one, as, besides the various modes in
which it is possible to pass from camphor to camphoric acid, which have
already been referred to, the relationship has been established by a series
of simple changes which render it possible to traverse the ground in the
reverse direction. The evidence is as follows : ^

(a) Camphoric Acid readily yields Homocamphoric Acid,

    When camphoric anhydride is treated with sodium amalgam under

suitable conditions, it is reduced to a lactone, campholide, as follows :

and campholide when heated with potassium cyanide yields cyanocampholic
acid, from which homocamphoric acid is easily obtained on hydrolysis.

       3. The Ketone Ring is either a 4- or a 5-Carbon Ring.

     Since camphoric acid very readily affords an anhydride on treatment
with acetyl chloride, even in the cold, it follows that it must be a deriva-

tive of succinic or of glutaric acid, so that it may be represented by one

of the formulae
--304 REPORT 1900.

    In support of this conclusion there may be advanced a number of

well-established facts, and the necessity for the discussion of the points

involved may be made the occasion for introducing the nomenclature

necessary for reference to the derivative of camphoric acid.

    1. Camphor Acid contains only one Hydrogen Atom in the

                a-PoSITION AVITH REGARD TO A CaRBOXYL GrOUP.

                                   (a) Bromination of Camphoric Acid.

     Camphoric acid is capable of affording, by direct bromination, one,

and only one, monobromo-derivative, zc-bromocamphoric acid. From
the study of a very large number of acids it has been ascertained that it
is possible to introduce as many bromine atoms as there are hydrogen
atoms in the a-position with regard to carboxyl groups, and in each

case where the products have been completely investigated it has been
shown that the entrant bromine atoms occupy the a-position. The
conclusion thus derived regarding camphoric acid is confirmed by a
large number of observations, and there is no sufficient reason to imagine
that the bromination of camphoric acid pursues any but the normal

course.

(b) Differential Reactivity of the two Carhoxyl Groups.

     Camphoric anhydride on treatment with ammonia yields exclusively,
or almost exclusively, a-camphoramic acid. This on distillation loses
water, yielding camphorimide, which when subjected to alkaline hydro-

lysis affords only /j-camphoramic acid.

     The reactivity of carboxyl or carboxyl groups in aliphatic compounds

invariably appears great or small according as the adjacent carbon

atom is hydrogenised or not. The above observations, which show that
there is an enormous difference between the reactivity of the carboxyl
groups in the anhydro-camphoric derivatives, are doubtless accounted
for by the fact that only one of the two carboxyl groups of camphoric

acid is an attachment to a hydrogenised carbon atom. On this assump-
tion the course of the changes referred to may probably be expressed

as follows :

     The six forms of camphoric acid are completely explained on the
assumption that in the molecule there arc two asymmetric carbon atoms
which are not equivalent. Designating the two carbon atoms by the

Aletters and B, the six forms may be represented by the combinations,

no internally compensated form being possible :

                    (A,,B,,) and (A,B()--<^- and /-camphoric acid.

                    (A,,B,,) and (A,,B,)...f?- and /-isocamphoric acid.

               +(AjB^, A,B,)... Inactive camphoric acid.
               +(AjB.j A^B,)... Inactive isocamphoric acid.^

     It does not appear that the sign of both asymmetric carbon atoms can

be revei'sed by simple means, but J-isocamphoric acid may be obtained

from c?-camphoric acid fairly readily ; as, for example, by treatment with
phosphorus pentachloride and water successively, whilst the reverse change

may also be effected by suitable means, such as boiling with acetyl
chloride, or by the process of bromination, when ordinary bromocamphoric-

anhydride is obtained.

The readiness with which one of these asymmetric carbon atoms is

affected makes it seem certain that this must be the atom on which a

carboxyl group and a hydrogen atom are attached, as there is here the

only grouping where the existence of tautomerism, or simple internal

Achange, appears possible.  glance at the simple scheme for camphoric

acid, moreover,

                            c

makes it appear highly probable that each carboxyl group is an attach-
ment to one or other asymmetric atom, and the difficulty of conceiving
any simple internal change which would affect the condition of the second
asymmetric atom accounts sufficiently well for the non-occurrence of

inversion in this instance.

     The occurrence of only two enantiomorphously related camphors is
probably dependent on stereochemical considerations, analogous to the
non-formation of anhydrides from ^raws-dicarboxylic acids of the poly-

m ethylene series.

     E.--DEGRADATION OF CAMPHOR DERIVATIVES.

    Whilst the material which has already been dealt with affords us much

useful evidence regarding the structure of the ketone ring, there is little or
none of it which afibrds us any assistance in coming to any conclusions
regarding the hydrocarbon ring. In order to gain any conception as to
the structure of the second nucleus it becomes necessary to consider the

nature of products which are obtained when this ring is broken down in

various ways.

     It will be convenient to refer to each of the various modes in turn,

and to consider the constitution of the products of known character as
they come under consideration.

    When camphor is subjected to prolonged heating with nitric or

chromic acid a large number of products are obtained, of which the more
important are camphoric acid and its oxidation products, namely, cam-
phanic acid, camphoronic acid, and trimethylsuccinic acid, together with
a small quantity of isocamphoronic acid, which is certainly an independent
product, as it does not appear to be produced from camphoric acid under
any circumstances.

  --(i.) Constitution of Camflwronia Acid. From a study of the products

obtained ))y the dry distillation of camphoronic acid Bredt Avas led to
the view that this acid had the structure

and this conclusion has been rendered final by the synthesis of the acid
by Perkin and J. F. Thorpe - in a manner the course of which admits of

only one interpretation.

monoxide, and is converted into a lactonic acid of known constitution,

lead peroxide and acetic acid is converted into a-dimethyltricarballylic

           (b) Oxidation of Camphoric Acid loith Diltde Cold Permanganate.

    When camphoric acid, dissolved in the requisite quantity of soda, is

allowed to remain with cold dilute potassium permanganate solution foi
some months, it is converted into a dibasic acid having the formula

C8Hi20,5 or C(;H[oO (C00H)2 and oxalic acid, the products being in

approximately equivalent amount. This acid yields only additive pro-
ducts with hydroxylamine or hydrazines, so that the lifth oxygen atom

does not possess true ketonic functions. On reduction it yields, first, a

lactonic acid, CgHioO^, and then <i/J/3-trimethylglutaric acid.
     Balbiano explains the behaviour of the acid CgH,20.;; on the assump-

tion that it is an acid possessing the structure of an oxide derived from

    When the two isomeric ethyl hydrogen camphorates (compare C. 1. b.)

are submitted to electrolysis the products consist for the most part of

camphorate (C. 1. b.) on electrolysis yields mostly the esters of two

acids are inactive, and are intraconvertible by processes analogous

to those whereby fumaric and maleic acids may be converted one into the

other.*

and the grounds for this statement are briefly as follows :

     It is inactive, and cannot be separated into active forms. It therefore
does not contain an asymmetric carbon atom.

     It is an o/3-unsaturated acid, as its dibromide loses carbon dioxide
and hydrogen bromide on treatment with soda or sodium carbonate, a
behaviour associated almost exclusively with a/3-dibromo acids. Moreover,
dihydroisolauronolic acid is readily brominated, as usual in the n-position,
and the mono-bromo acid on treatment with alkali affords isolauronolic
acid and a-hydroxydihydroisolauronolic acid.^

     The formation of isolauronic acid, during the oxidation of isolauronolic

acid with faintly alkaline permanganate, hithei'to so difficult to undei'stand,
is easily explained by the use of the foregoing formula, as the first action
of the oxidising agent would result in the formation of an acid derived
from a 1 : 5-diketone, a class of compounds Tery prone to undergo con-
densation in alkaline solution, that is to say, under conditions similar to
those in which isolauronic acid arises : -

liypobromite is converted into a tribasic acid, C,,H].,Ofj, which loses carbon

tricarboxylic acid, homocamphoronic acid, and must therefore be a penta-
methylene and not a tetramethylene derivative ; for since it affords
camphoronic acid (F. 1. a. ii.) on oxidation it could only be one of these.^

     It should be pointed out that the first of the two formulse above given
is almost certainly the correct one, as camphononic acid does not at once
atford an oxime or hydrozones as do the majority of acids having the

carbonyl group in attachment to two CHo groups. Moreover it cannot be

made to combine with hydrogen cyanide, and it is therefore highly pro-
bable that the reactivity of the carbonyl group is affected by its attach-
ment to a carbon atom on which no hydrogen is present.'

elements of formic acid and addition of the elements of sulphuric acid.

              (c) Action of Hiipuhromites on Ihe Isomeric Cianphoraiuic Acids.

is converted into aminodihydrolauronolic acid in accordance with the
equation

COOH.C,H,4.CONH., + Br,, + 2KOH=COOH.C,Hi4.NH.,

This amino-acid on treatment with nitrous fumes yields a hydrocarbon
CgH,4, ^y-lauronolic acid, CsHi.tCOOH, isocampholactone, CgHi402,
and an acid, melting at 180°, which has the formula C,)Hi.iO^.

    Hydroxydihydrolauronolic acid may be obtained from the ethyl ester

of the amino acid by means of nitrous acid and subsequent saponifica-

tion. On treatment with cold chromic acid mixture it loses carbon

dioxide and is converted into a ketone ; a behaviour which appears to
indicate that the hydroxyl group is in the /3-position with regard to the

carboxyl group.

    (ii.) When /3- camphoramic acid is subjected to the action of hypo-

bromite it suffers a change similar to that which the a-acid undergoes,
and is eonvei'ted into amino- dihydrocampholytic acid. This, on treat-
ment with nitrous acid, yields a hydroxy-acicl and subsequently campho-
lytic and isolauronolic acids. The elimination of the «Z/o-carbonyl group
in this manner, therefore, leads to results similar to those already

mentioned."*

     i. I^ORMATION AND PROPERTIES OF THE CaMPHOLENIC DERIVATIVES.

     The isomeric substances n- and /3-campholenic acids are obtained in
several ways, the most important of these being the dehydration of cam-
phoroxine by various methods, when their nitriJes are produced in large

quantities :

                      C,,,H,,:N.0H=C,,H,5 .CN + H2O.

     Interesting, also, is the fact that u-campholenic acid is found amongst
the products obtained by the action of sodium amalgam on /3-dibromo-
camphor.

          C,oH,,Br,0 + 2H + H20=C,,H|, . COOH + 2HBr.

    The campholenio acids are undoubtedly both unsaturated monobasic

acids containing one closed carbon f;hain. The o-acid is optically active,

whilst the /3-acid and all its derivatives ai-e quite                              inactive                                  so  that both
                                                                                                                          ;

the asymmetric carbon atoms of camphor have been involved in the change

whereby this substance is produced. Both the «- and the /3-acids have the

double or ethylenic linking at the y- or t-pusition, as both are readily

converted into lactones when treated with dilute acids.

    a-Campholenic acid may be converted into /3-campholenic acid by several

processes, and invariably becomes inactive during the process. It would

appear from this that /3-campholenic acid is a secondary product of

change.

    Each acid, on oxidation with potassium permanganate, is converted

into a dihydroxydihydrocampholenic acid by addition of the elements of

hydrogen peroxide in the usual way. When these dihydroxy acids are

distilled they are converted by loss of water into new substances, pre-

sumably ketonic acids, the a -acids affording pinonic acid, which is an

u-Dihydroxydihydrocampholenic acid is dextrogyrate and on oxidation

with chromic acid yields inactive isoketocamphoric acid, and with nitric

acid gives isodiketocamphoric acid. Both of these latter contain acetyl
groups, and isoketocamphoric acid is converted into bromoform and iso-

camphoronic acid (E. 1. a. ii.) on treatment with cold hypobromite. These

changes are expressed by Tiemann ^ as follows :

     This scheme expresses the foregoing facts in a highly satisfactory
manner, including the cessation of inactivity with the passage from
fi-dihydroxydihydrocampholenic acid to isoketocamphoric acid, and

appears, moreover, to be the only mode of doing so. The inadequacy of
any formula for campholenic acid or pinonic acid which does not

contain the group

is shown by the fact that one of the products obtained by oxidising pinonic

COOHacid is hydroxytrimethylsuccinic acid,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   .

/3-Dihydroxydihydrocampholenic acid (of course inactive, since /3-cam-

pholenic acid has this property) on further oxidation with dilute per-

manganate yields oxalic and y-acetyldimethylbutyric acid, which affords
a-dimethylglutaric acid on treatment with alkaline hypobromite. Tiemann

expresses these facts in the following way :

     Such change as that assumed in the transformation of the di-
hydroxy-acid is obviously inadequate without furtlier proof. Moreover
the inactivity of /j-campholenic acid receives no explanation whatever, as
it is scarcely conceivable that the asymmetry of the carbon atom to which
the activity of « -campholenic acid is clue has been in any way destroyed.

     Proceeding backwards in a logical manner from the fact of the
formation of y-acetyldimethylbutyric acid and oxalic acid, we are led
almost inevitably to the formula for /3-campholenic acid which was first
suggested by Bouveault,'- namely

               P.--THE FORMULA OF CAMPHOR.

     The earlier speculations regarding the constitutional formula of
camphor require no special discussion at the present time, as they are of
merely historical interest, and there is no doubt that the first great
advance was made by Bredt in his paper on 'The Con.stitution of
Camphoronic Acid,' ·'' and the value of his deductions has been greatly
enhanced since the achievement of the synthesis of this acid by Perkin
and Thorpe,'' which provided a complete proof of the formula suggested for
it by Bredt.

     Starting from the formula of camphoronic acid, as it is generally

agreed we may do, and taking into account the fact that camphor readily

yields cymene by the action of various agents, Bredt was led to advance
the formula associated with his name. This formula has since been
assailed by several chemists, notably Noyes, Tiemann, Bouveault, Blanc,

                                                                                         ' See also Tiemann, £er., 28, 1079, 216G, &c.

Walker, and Perkiii, but the formula suggested by Tiemann must now be

regarded as quite out of the question ; whilst the formula specially

advocated by Perkin, whilst greatly preferable, is now known to have
no probability in its favour. It is significant that the chemists who at

the present day strenuously advocate the acceptance of any formula other

than Bredt's have made a special study of isolauronolic acid.
     Latterly chemists have come to regard it as definitely established that

camphor contains the grouping

                                       CMe.O

                         CMe,,
                                    C

and it is easily demonstrated that besides three formula containing this

complex, only one other structure for camphor can be devised which

contains the grouping of carbon atoms of camphoronic acid, and also

conforms to the established conditions referred to in B, C, and D. 'Jliat

but nothing further can be said in favour of it.

   Conclusive proof that the above trimethylpentamethylene nucleus is

present in camphor is afibrded by the fact that camphononic acid, which

is obtainable from camphor in three entirely different ways, two of these

involving no change in the hydrogenised nucleus, undoubtedly has the

of which the second, as has already been stated, has nothing further in

its favour, and it does not appear possible to explain by its use the

properties and constitution of many important products obtained by

degrading the camphor molecule in the various ways detailed in E.

It is quite clear, therefore, that in the light of our present knowledge

only two formulre for camphor can be regarded as in the slightest degree

probable, namely, the Bredt and the Perkin-Bouveault formulae ; and
although it might at first sight appear an easy matter to decide between

two formulte so different in configuration, each still finds support in
Aapparently incontrovertible evidence.
                                        list of the facts to which each

formula appears capable of ready application may be dealt with in turn,

only those points being taken which appear to be of use in coming to a

decision as to the relative value of the two formulae.

represents a substituted adipic acid, derivatives of which are almost

invariably incapable of affording anhydrides when treated by the ordinary
processes. Using the Perkin-Bouveault formula, homocamphoric acid

would have the structure

which is that of a glutaric acid, and should therefore be expected to yield
an anhydride fairly readily, unless the structure is that of a trans-acid, an
assumption which appears to be excluded by the fact that d-camphorie
acid from which it is easily obtained is a cis-acid, the corresponding
ti'ans-aciA being represented by iso camphoric acid.

    As pointed out by Bredt and Kosenburg,' Wislicenus - and Perkin

and Crossley,-' the formation of considerable quantities of ketones by
distillation of the barium or calcium salts of dibasic acids, in the simple
manner here observed, is met with only amongst the derivatives of adipic,
pimetic, and suberic acids, and never amongst those of glutaric acid, so
that here again the Perkin-Bouveault formula appears inadmissible.

of only two simple explanations, one of those being the assumption that

and not only is this the case, but the derived formula of camphononic
acid is in complete accordance with the disinclination of the carbonyl
group to form additive complexes (compare E. 2. a. ii.).

     The Perkin-Bouveault formula is, in tliis instance also, inapplicable,
unless, as usual, a special assumption is made to meet the case. Thus,
no doubt, it might be held that an intermediate compound having the

formula

                                    .CO-CH. CO.COOH

     This formula ofifers simple explanations of the following points, for
which the Bredt formula appears inadequate.

(a) The Formation of Isolauronolic Acid from Camphoric Acid in
                                        several Ways.

     The formation of this acid by elimination of the aZZo-carboxyl group
from camphoric acid is readily explained by the use of this formula :

/CMe, . CMe . COOH         CMe, . CMe

     The change represents the formation of acids having the formula proved
by Blanc to be correct for isolauronolic acid, and of course affects both
asymmetric carbon atoms, thus explaining the complete disappearance of

optical activity during their formation.

     (b) The formation and properties of ^-campholenic acid.

In explaining the production of a campholenonitrile from caraphor-

oxime, as represented by the Perkin-Bouveault formula, we are led in a

most simple manner to the formula, which, as was pointed out by Bou-

veault, is the most suitable one for )8-campliolenonitrile which can be

devised :                       CMe.,--CMe CN

whilst it is clear that the use of Bredt's formula would require the
assumption that isomeric change of a somewhat obscure character had
taken place. If this formula be the correct one, /3-campholenic acid, as
might be surmised from a consideration of its inactivity and its oxidation

products, is in reality homoisolauronolic acid.

(c) The Formation and Troperties of Hydroxydihi/drolauronolic Acid.

    By the use of the Perkin-Bouveault formula the action of hypobromite

on rt-camphoramic acid would be represented

CH.,

      CH2--CH . CONH,                     CH2--CH . NH2

and the formula so deduced for the amino-acid repi'esents a /3-amino acid,
which should naturally afford a /3-hydroxy acid on treatment with nitrous
acid. Since a /3-hydroxy acid would yield a /3-ketonic acid on oxidation,
the elimination of carbon dioxide and production of a ketone are easy to

understand (compare E. 2. c. i.).

   A consideration of the whole of the preceding facts leads to the con-

clusion that it is impossible to reconcile the results obtained in the various

departments of camphor chemistry without having recourse to the

assumption that, at certain points, intramolecular change takes place,

involving new arrangements of the carbon atoms. Thus, to take only one
example, the structure of the a- and /3-campholenic acids cannot be re-
presented by two formulae which differ only in the position of the double
binding as Tiemann suggested, for one acid clearly contains the grouping

                            : CMe . CMe^         CC

     The formation of isocamphoronic acid on the one hand and of iso-
lauronolic acid on the other is also incapable of explanation on any other
grounds than that of intramolecular change ; and it would appear advis-
able, therefore, to consider the whole of the evidence from a broad stand-
point, and, having decided which is the more probable view, to endeavour
to ascertain the points at which difficulties first arise, and only then to
seek for explanations. It is obvious that it would be altogether ill-advised
to adopt the usual course and to take any one derivative, however well
established its structure may be, and however simple its apparent mode
of derivation, and to use this as the basis on which to form our conclu-
sions, employing a forced explanation for each inconvenient fact in turn.

      Looking at the question, first, from a general point of view, without
regard to ultimate structure, it must be obvious that the probabilities are
greatly in favour of the view that the ketone ring in camphor is a penta-
methylene nucleus, as witness the readiness with which the substance is
obtained from homocamphoric acid. Moreover the properties of homo-
camphoric acid itself approach more neai-ly those of an adipic than glutaric
acid, since under no circumstances does it appear to yield an anhvHride.

                                                                                                                      Y2
824 REPORT-- 1900.

The general properties of camphoric acid are those of a glutaric acid, as its

In'omo-derivative at once yields a stable lactone ; a behaviour altogether
inconsistent with the view that it is an a-brominated succinic acid.

     The supporters of the succinic acid formula for camphoric acid have
raised the contention that bromocamphoric acid is a /3-brominated acid
containing the complex

                             CHBr . CPI . COOH

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   :I

and in support of this advance the fact that its anhydride on treatment
with water or sodium carbonate loses carbon dioxide and hydrogen bromide,
yielding a small quantity of lauronolic acid, a behaviour certainly in
accordance with the view that it is a /3-bromo-acid. The necessity for
such an assumption, however, is in itself clearly an argument against the
succinic formula, since the bromination of a saturated acid in the /3-posi-
tion is unknown. Moreover on this assumption bromocamphoric anhy-
dride itself still contains an a -hydrogen atom, and should be capable of
further bromination, a surmise altogether at variance with the facts. It

is much more probable that the formation of lauronolic acid is due to an
idiosyncrasy of the compounds involved, and little or nothing is known of

the behaviour of cycloid a-bromo-acids in this respect.
      It obviously cannot be urged that the formation of lauronolic acid is

evidence in favour of the presence of the complex

                             CH2 . CBr . COOH

                               C . C COOH

                                          C

as such an acid would afford an isomer of lauronolic acid, possibly campho-
lytic or isolauronolic, and containing the complex

                                CH., . C . COOH

                                                                                                                                                                                        II

and, in fact, that it does not do so isi in 'tself evidence against the
succinic formula for camphoric acid.

     It may therefore be stated that the general properties of camphor and

camphoric acid are of a kind which should be expected were Bredt's
formula the correct one.

     Comparing now the weight of evidence in favour of the two formulae

as elicited by examination of the exact structure of the degradation pro-
ducts of camphor, Bredt's formula is seen to be favoured in a high degree,
and only the structure of isolauronolic acid and of /3-campholenic acid
(probably, as has been pointed out, homoisolauronolic acid) appears to

militate strongly against its acceptance. It is especially significant,
moreover, that the /3-campholenic derivatives are produced, probably in

all cases, as secondary products from the a -derivatives, and the behaviour

of the latter is in strict accordance with the requirements of Bredt's

formula.
      It is certainly difficult to understand the behaviour of hydroxydihy-

drolauronolic acid, but until more is known of this acid it is possible to

attach undue significance to the point.
     It is impossible to overlook the fact that the Bredt formula affords an

excellent explanation of the behaviour of a very large number of camphor
derivatives, and is, in fact, the only formula which will do so, and that the
same words apply to the Perkin-Bouveault formula when the remainder,
namely, isolauronolic acid and /3-campholenic acid, are referred to.

     Since the constitutions of the two different series of compounds appear
to have been established with such a high degree of probability, one is led
to the belief that there may, after all, be some close connection between
the two series which has escaped observation owing to the occurrence of

--unsuspected isomeric change a phenomenon which it is generally admitted

must be the cause of the present divergence of opinion on the matter.
     It does not require much consideration to observe that if this explana-

tion be correct the isomeric change must occur during the formation of
isolauronolic acid, and in the transformation of the a- to the /3-cam-
pholenic derivatives, so that a comparison of the probable formulae of

     It is fairly clear that the apparent change consists in the migration of
a' methyl group to an adjacent carbon atom in both cases. The alteration
of the position of the double binding in the campholenic derivatives is of
little consequence, as the change is probably preceded by the formatioix
of a lactone in some cases, of an imide in others, and these derivatives

contain no double binding. Possibly the change in the former case may

be represented

changes apparently characteristic of complexes which contain several
adjacent methyl groups. It is well known, moreover, that in the forma-
tion of benzenoid derivatives from hexamethylene compounds the methyl
groups usually appear to move to adjacent carbon atoms ; as, for example,
in the change of isolauronic acid into paraxylic acid

It may be urged that the conditions under which isolauronolic acid is

produced from camphor are not such as would be expected to produce

deep-seated isomeric change, but such a contention is altogether insufficient

to seriously militate against the great probability that it does actually occur

ifli this instance. It is easy to cite evidence that isomeric changes of very

unexpected character do occur under conditions which would at first sight

appear to be insufficient to produce them, such as, for example, the change

of c(-dibromocamphor into bromocamphorenic acid when warmed with an

alcoholic solution of silver nitrate on the water bath, which certainly

involves the absorption of a carbon atom into a ring somewhat in this

manner :

i Finally, whilst it appears unlikely that any simpler explanation than

         that here suggested can be offered, the question clearly awaits further
         investigation ; but it seems unlikely that the correct solution will be
         obtained until the attention of investigators is directed to the examina-
        tion of the points at which isomeric change probably occurs, since the
        discovery of isolated facts in favour of either formula can only add to the

        number of those already known, and can scarcely be regarded as conclusive

         whilst strong evidence in favour of the other formula can be brought
         forward.

    The curious properties of lauronolic acid (2. a. ii.) may possibly be

accounted for by the occurrence of a change of structure similar to that
above suggested in the cases of /3-campholenic acid and isolauronolic acid,
and by applying a similar rule, the change might be represented

  I. 071 the Pleistocene near Toronto. By Professor A. P. Coleman . . . Z2%
 II. On the Pleistocene Flora of the Don Valley. By Professor D. P. Penhallow 384

During the past year the Committee has suffered a severe loss through

the death of its distinguished chairman, Sir J. W. Dawson, but the work
has been continued by three of its members. Dr. Ami has taken charge

of the Ottawa valley deposits, Professor Penhallow has examined the
fossil flora from both Ottawa and Toronto, and the Secretary has con-
tinued his investigations near Toronto. The following report on the
Pleistocene near Toronto has been prepared by the Secretary, and that

on the Flora of the Don Valley by Professor Penhallow.

1. On the Pleistocene near Toronto. By Professor A. P. Coleman.

     Since the preparation of the last report two new localities near
Toronto have proved of interest, one near a bend of the Don a little east

of the well reported on last year, the other a series of sand deposits in

the western part of the city. The outcrop at the bend of the Don just
north-west of Toronto was discovered years ago by Dr. G. J. Hinde, who
had described so excellently the section at Scarborough Heights, and who

has been good enough to hand over his material to the Secretary. Until
last year, however, it was not certainly proved to be interglacial. The

section at the bend of the Don is of special interest, since it occupies an

interglacial valley about 700 feet wide, having steep walls of Hudson
River (Cambro-silurian) shale, rising 8 or 10 feet on the eastern side and

--16 feet on the western. The section is as follows :

4. Coarse gravel with boulders and no shells, 4 to 8 feet .  . 37 to 40

3. Brown clay with sandy layers containing unios, &c., 4 or 5 feet 33 or 34

2. Blue clay with sandy layers containing shells and wood, 6 feet 29

.231. Coarse shingle with clay and peaty layers, 4 feet .
...River Don, above level of Lake Ontario  .

                                                             .19

     The lowest layer goes below the level of the Don, so that the bottom

ot the section is not exposed. The third layer corresponds exactly in
materials and fossils with the unio beds referred to in last year's report,
which are in place 100 yards to the west, and there overlie a thin sheet

of boulder clay resting on a cliff of shale 16 feet in height. Beds 1 and 2

contain trees of a warm climate, as determined by Professor Penhallow,

and twelve species of freshwater shells, according to determinations
kindly made by Dr. Dall of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington,
two of the shells, Unio (Quadrula) pyramidata and Anodonta grandis,
being new to the Toronto formation.

     The most important feature of this section is the evidence afforded tliat
CANADIAN PLEISTOCENE FLORA AND FAUNA.                                 329

a period of erosion, during which the floor of Hudson River shale was cut
down more than 16 feet, preceded the deposit of the lowest warm climate

beds. This, with the downward extension of the interglacial beds, as

described in previous reports, for at least 15 feet, lengthens the time

necessary for the interglacial episode considerably.

The new deposits in the western part of the city are exposed partly

in cuttings for sewers, but chiefly in two large sandpits, now worked

energetically because of the increase of building operations in Toronto.

These exposures lie from three to four miles west of the Don and are

either interglacial or preglacial, since more or less boulder clay overlies
them, though wave-action on the old Iroquois shore, 160 feet above the
present Lake Ontario, has removed part of the overlying till.

Sections at the sandpits near Christie and Shaw Streets show

30 to 40 feet of sand and gravel tumultuously cross-bedded, as if formed

in a rapidly flowing river or near the shore of a large lake. The upper

part of the stratified sand is often contorted and broken into irregular

masses immediately under the till. The more gravelly layers contain a

few shells, c\n.QQ.j Campelomadecisa, Valvata sincera, species of Pleurocera

Aand Sphaerium, and occasionally fragments of unios.         few mammalian

remains have occurred also, fragments of a tusk of mammoth or mastodon,

and an atlas vertebra of an animal not smaller than an ox, having been
found within the past year. The latter bone could not be determined by

comparison with the skeletons at hand in the Biological Museum of

Toronto University, and so was sent by Mr. Archibald Pride of the

Biological Museum, to whom it had been referred, to his brother in

Dublin. There it was considered to belong probably to Bison americanus.

Toronto is the most easterly locality in Canada where remains of this

inhabitant of the prairies have been found.

    As these stratified sands differ greatly from any of the interglacial beds
of the Don or Scarborough, though underlying apparently the same sheet
of till, it seemed possible that they were preglacial. To settle this point it

was decided to sink a well to bed rock from the bottom of the Christie Street

sandpit, using the grant of 10/. to the Committee for this purpose. As the

sand below the bottom of the pits is heavily charged with water, it was
necessary to drill the well and sink a pipe as the work progressed. After

thirty-eight feet of rather uniform sand had been penetrated, a layer of
cemented gravel or conglomerate put an end to the work with the appliances
employed.

     Another well was sunk half a mile to the south, near a stream which
had cut through forty feet of till. Here the drill reached the underlying
Hudson River shale, giving a complete section of the drift, as follows :

    As no boulder clay was found beneath the sand, the question remained

undecided whether the beds are interglacial or preglacial ; but the open-
ing of a sewer on Dupont Street, half a mile north-east of the sandpits, has
330 REPORT-- 1900.

since provided evidence favouring the interglacial age of the sands. At

the sewer stratified sand, evidently a continuation of the deposits just
mentioned, contains clayey sheets with thin bands of peaty material con-
taining remains of beetles, mosses, seeds, plates of mica, &c., precisely like

the peat from the cold climate series of Scarborough and the Don

valley. Since these peaty layers are probably equivalent in age to the

peaty clays east of the city, we may suppose that the sandy deposits of

the western part of Toronto are also interglacial, in the upper part evi-
dently belonging to the cold climate series, but perhaps representing the

warm climate deposits at lower levels. It is clear that the conditions in

Western Toronto must have been different from those to the east,
since here a great thickness of stratified sand replaces stratified clay.

This may be explained by supposing that an interglacial Humber river

brought from the west sand and gravel into the great lake then occu-
pying the Ontario Valley to mingle with the clayey delta materials of the
interglacial Laurentian river flowing from Georgian Bay to Scarborough.

     Just beneath a thin sheet of till in the Dupont Street sewer the upper

end of the ulna of a mammoth or mastodon was found, the bone having

been polished and scratched by glacial action, suggesting that it lay on
the surface when the ice advanced for the last time. Some pieces of wood
occurred near by, but lower down in the section.

   We may now sum up the results obtained by the Committee and

former investigators of the Toronto formation, so as to show the series of
events recorded, the thickness of the deposits, and the fossils obtained from
them.

     In most places the Toronto formation is found to overlie a bed of cha-
racteristic boulder clay containing rocks brought from long distances to
the north or north-east, and covering the eroded surface of the Cambro-

silurian rocks of the region. This boulder clay probably belongs to the

lowan till sheet of the United States. After the retreat of the ice there
was an interval of erosion shown near Shaw Street, and in the interglacial
i-iver valley at the bend of the Don ; followed by the deposit of clay, sand,
and gravel containing trees and unios of a warmer climate than the
present, the greatest thickness amounting to thirty-three feet in the Don
valley, and to thirty-five feet below Lake Ontario at Scarborough.

     These beds have nowhere been found at a higher level than fifty feet
above Lake Ontario, and the upper sands and gravels were probably laid

down in shallow water, since they are browned and sometimes cemented

with oxide of iron.

     Conformably upon the warm climate beds are a series of beds

containing trees and other fossils, especially beetles, suggesting a cooler
climate than the present ; not Arctic, however, but cold temperate.
These are best shown at Scarborough Heights, where stratified peaty
clays starting a few feet below the level of Lake Ontario have a thickness
of ninety-five feet, followed by fifty-five feet of stratified sand. It is pro-

bable that part at least of the seventy feet of sand found in the western
part of Toronto is of the same age. The interglacial lake at this stage
must have stood at least 150 feet higher than Lake Ontario.

   A long period of erosion followed the draining of this lake, during

which river valleys a mile or more in width were cut through the delta
deposits at Scarborough to the depth of more than 1 50 feet comparable to

those cut by the Don and Humber since the Glacial period.

      Finally a fresh advance of the ice, probably belonging to the Wisconsio
CANADIAN PLEISTOCENE FLORA AND FAUNA.                         331

stage of American geologists, covered the Toronto formation with a com-
plex series of layers of boulder clay and stratified sand and clay reaching
a thickness of 200 feet at Scarborough Heights.

      Accounts of the fossils of the Toronto formation have been given in
previous reports of this Committee and in various articles in geological
journals, but in this final report it is thought wise to give a more complete
list of the species collected, including a large number that have not yet

been published. As the trees will be taken up in Professor Penhallow's

report, the present list is confined to the interglacial fauna. The forms -

occurring in the lower, warm climate beds will be given first, and after-

wards those of the cool climate.

complete account of the new species, with ligures, will be published shortly

by the Canadian Geological Survey. The new species confirm Dr. Scudder
in the opinion expressed when the first set of specimens was described,

' that on the whole the fauna has a boreal aspect, though by no means

so decidedly boreal as one would anticipate under the circumstances.'
The Committee warmly appreciates the kindness and patience of Dr.
Scudder in working up this fragmentary and difficult material.

In all at least seventy-eight species of animals are known from the

cool climate beds, seventy of them extinct, and the total number may

reach eighty-seven                                                                         while  in  the  lower warm climate beds    at  least fifty

species are known to exist. Only four of the seventy- eight species

recognised in the upper beds occur also in the lower beds; so that 124

species of animals, chiefly insects and molluscs, but including also the

caribou, bison, and mammoth or mastodon, have been found in the Toronto

interglacial formation. If we include the flora, with its numerous forest

trees, it will be seen that there are ample materials for reconstructing the
life of the time and for determining the climate. That the Toronto
formation is interglacial has been proved beyond doubt, and that it

represents an interglacial period lasting thousands of years is scarcely

doubtful. Two points are of special importance in this connection. In

the first place, there was a considerable interval of erosion after the

eai-lier withdrawal of the ice before the warm climate beds began to be

deposited, and there was a long time of active erosion after the cool

climate beds had been formed before the ice advanced for the second
time. These times of erosion, with the long intervening time when the
valley of Lake Ontario was filled with fresh water to a depth of 50
to 150 feet greater than at present, demand not only a great lapse of
time but also important warpings and changes of level in the St. Lawrence
valley. In the next place it is striking that none of the scores of species
of plants and animals found is characteristic of an Arctic or even sub-
Arctic climate. All of them might live in Ontario to-day except a few
which require a warmer climate, i.e. they all belong to climates rano-inf

from warm temperate to cold temperate, meaning by the latter the climate

of the north shore of Lake Superior or of the lower St. Lawrence. The
deposits seem to have been formed, not during the earlier retreat of the
ice, nor during its second advance, but during a temperate era, when in
all probability eastern Canada was as devoid of permanent icefields as
it is to-day. Our investigations go far ta prove that between the two
--334 REPORT 1900.

advances of the ice there was a long temperate interval during which
even the heart of Labrador, 700 miles to the north-east, must have been
free from glaciers.

II. The Pleistocene Flora of the Don Valley. By Prof. D. P. Penhallow.

     Special studies relative to the pleistocene flora of Canada have now

 been carried on since 1889, the first report on the subject having been

made by Dawson and Penhallow in 1890.' Other contributions have
been made from time to time, but upon the occasion of the meeting of
the British Association at Toronto in 1897 a special impetus was given

to this work by the appointment of a Committee, to whom a grant was

made for the purposes of investigation, particularly in the neighbourhood
of Toronto. Under these favourable conditions much material has been
brought together, chiefly from the immediate vicinity of Toronto, and its
determination has thrown much important light upon the climatic con-

ditions of the various geological phases through which that region evidently
passed in interglacial times. During the past decade or more, other
important material has been gathered from various localities-- often most

widely separated-- throughout the Dominion. As the work of the
Committee is now practically completed, it is considered wise, in this

final report, to bring together all the information from these various
sources and endeavour to ascertain its bearing upon questions of current
interest and importance.

      Plants from eighteen special localities have been studied, ranging
from Manitoba to Cape Breton, and particular attention has been directed
to those from at least twelve of these locations, chiefly from the vicinity
of Toronto.

     Eighty-three species in all have been studied, the largest number from
any one locality (Taylor's Brickyard) being twenty-seven. In several
instances only one or two species have been obtained from a locality, in
which cases they afford no definite conclusions respecting the climatic

conditions of the locality ; but in other cases the character of the vegeta-
tion is such as to leave no room for doubt as to the climatic conditions
involved. In the Valley of the Don, numerous collections from the same

localities have resulted in a constant diminution in the number of dis-
coveries, until latterly the total absence of anything new has brought the
conviction that the flora of the region has been exhausted, and an in-
spection of the accompanying table will at once serve to disclose the extent
of the flora in each locality examined. The explorations of the past year
have added nothing new to our knowledge of the flora of these localities,
since the various plants found have proved to be only such as had been
previously determined. There is therefore little to be added to the
observations made in previous years, but attention may be directed to a
few considerations of interest which appear upon comparison of the various

localities studied.

     Of the eighteen localities under observation, five are so distant from
one another and from all others as to bear no obvious relation to each
other, or else the piant-remains are so few as to render them of little
value except from the general standpoint of geographical range. These
localities are Cape Breton, Rolling River (Manitoba), Solsgirth and Leda

River (Manitoba), and Moose and Missinaibi Rivers. The
thirteen localities are so situated as to bear a more or less definite relation
to one another, and all lie within the limits of the Pleistocene Sea which
extended up the valley of the St. Lawrence, and occupied the area of the
present Great Lakes. It should be kept in mind in this connection, how-
ever, that saltwater forms are to be met with only as far west as Green's
Oreek, near Ottawa, while freshwater types prevail in all the more
western localities, which thus correspond in a general way with the de-
posits of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Manitoba, and other western

    At Gi-een's Creek, near Ottawa, and at Besserer's Wharf, a few miles

below on the Ottawa River, numerous plant remains are found enclosed

in clay nodules, but their very fragmentary character often renders their

determination most unsatisfactory. These two localities, although sepa-

rately treated, are in reality one and the same, since the deposit at each

place is of the same nature, and was undoubtedly laid down at the same

in place. 35"71 per cent, are land plants, drifted in by tributary rivers,

and 28*57 per cent, represent semi-aquatics and marsh plants from adjacent

land areas. The vegetation, as a whole, is identical with that now found
in the same i-egion, from which we may infer similar climatic conditions.

    At Scarborough Heights, near Toronto, the flora is rather remarkable

for the complete absence of aquatic types, showing the drift character of
the entire deposit. Fourteen species in all have been found there, and of

these six are trees, while the remaining eight embrace mosses, equiseta,
and herbaceous or half-shrubby plants. The vegetation as a whole is of

a decidedly more boreal type than that now flourishing in the same region,

and, if anything, somewhat more northern than that which is to be found
in the deposits at Green's Creek and Montreal. This points to a climate

equivalent to that of northern Quebec and Labrador, as we know it
to-day, and somewhat colder than the climate at Green's Creek and

Montreal during Pleistocene time.

    In the Don Valley no less than eight separate localities have been
examined. Some of them, as at Simpson's, proved practically ban-en of

results so far as plant remains were concerned, owing to the uncontrollable

influx of water. Others again, as at Taylor's Brickyard and the Don

River, proved to be exceptionally rich in material, and afforded some of the
most valuable results obtained. Within this area no less that thirty-ei«ht

species have been recovered, and they point conclusively to the existence of

climatic conditions diff"ering materially from those which now prevail, and of
a character more nearly allied to that of the middle United States of to-day.

     The Erie Clays at Hamilton, Ontario, have afforded only one example
of plant life, and this does not materially aid us in any conclusions relative

to climatic conditions, since it is a type having a somewhat wide ran^e
within the warmer zone, represented by the more southern types of the

Pleistocene flora.

Only one species appears to have disappeared in Pleistocene time. Acer

pleistocenicum, which was abundant in the region of the Don, bears no

well-defined resemblance to existing species. With this one exception, it

is a noteworthy fact that all the plants of the Pleistocene flora were such

as are now represented in the same localities, or, in the case of the Don

Valley, by plants which find the northern limits of their distribution at or

near that region, and the somewhat unequal distribution thus indicated

at once suggests definite climatic changes during Pleistocene time, as

represented by the northern and southern migration of particular types of

plants. This has already been referred to in previous reports and publi

cations, but it may be repeated at this time that the definite and abundant

occurrence of JIaclura aurantiaca, Jimiperun virr/iniana, Quercux obtusi-

loha, Quercus ohlongifolia, Asimina triloba, Chamaecyparis Sphaeroided,

and Fraxinus quadrangulata points without question to the pi'evalence of

a much warmer climate than now prevails, while, on the other hand, the

equally abundant occurrence of boreal types at Scarborough points to
the existence of a colder climate at the time these deposits were laid
down. It is therefore clear that in the region of Toronto during Pleisto-
cene time there were at least two distinct periods, characterised, on the
one hand, by a climate equivalent to that of the middle United States at
the present day, and, on the other hand, a climate equivalent to that of
northern Quebec and Labrador. According to stratigraphical evidence
obtained by Professor Coleman, these changes followed the recession of

the ice sheet in the or-der given, from which we are to conclude that the
climate of the Don Valley is now intermediate between that of the first

and second periods, approaching the former.

    On the other hand, again, the flora of Green's Creek and Besserer's,
as also that of Montreal, is practically identical with that now existing in

the same localities. It thus represents a climate colder than that of the

Don period, but somewhat warmer than that of the Scarborough period, but

present evidence does not enable us to ascertain if these deposits were

laid down before or after the Scarborough deposits. The following sum-
mary will probably assist iu conveying a clearer idea of the distinctive

dififerences in the vegetation of these three periods.

--Exploration of Irish Caves. Interim Report of the Committee, con-

     sisting of Br. R. F. ScHARFF (Chairman), Mr. E. Lloyd Praeger
      (Secretary), Mr. G. Coffey, Professor Grenville Cole, Professor
     D. J. Cunningham, Mr. A. McHenry, and Mr. R. J. Ussher.

Owing to various circumstances, especially illness of some of the
members, the Committee were unable during the past year to commence

the exploration of the caves in the west of Ireland. These caves promise
to yield satisfactory results, and the Committee recommend that they
should be reappointed, with a renewed grant of 20/.

It is to be regretted that since the meeting at Dover no individual
reports have been received from members of the Committee, and that the
lamellibranchs collected at Eccup only have been examined and named.

     The Secretary suggests that the most important points to settle are
the faunas of (a) the beds which occur between the Millstone Grits and
the Massif of Limestone in the South Pennine area, and (b) the fauna
which occur in the shales between the Millstone Grits and the upper beds

    Limestone in the North Pennine area. This would settle at once the
correlation of Pendleside Limestone and its equivalent in the Yoredale
series of Wensleydale.

     Mr. B. jN". Peach has been at work on the faunas of the Calciferous
Sandstone series of Fife, and it is hoped that a full detailed report will
be received next year. It would be well if a grant could be made to
employ a collector to woi'k the shales of Pendle Hill, and if possible in
Swale and Teesdalc.

   --The Committee regret to report the loss, )jy death, of two of their

number the late Professor AUeyne Nicholson and G. H. Morton. Mr.
Morton was an ardent worker at Carboniferous geology, and had
specially confined his attention to North Wales ; a full list of Carboni-
ferous fossils from this district was to have been prepared by him this

year.

                                   APPENDIX.

                      Interim Report hy Dr. Wheelton Hind.

      In the ' Geological Magazine,' 1898, Dec. IV. vol. v. pp. 61-69, I gave

a brief sketch of what was known of the Life Zones of the Carboniferous
 deposits of Europe, and at p. 68 showed the following table, which

represented the main results of my inN-estigatious up to that date.

842 REPORT-- 1900.

    Further work has convinced me of the correctness of these main zonal

divisions, and observations on the subdivision of the lower part of Zone 3
are approaching to some degree of exactness.

    With regai-d to the subdivision of group 4 I am in hopes that
Edmondia sulcata and Allorisma monensis may be found to indicate an

horizon in Zone 4 ; but as yet these fossils have not been found in the
 South Pennine area.

      I consider interesting the discovery of CypricardeUa rectangidaris,
C. Anna-, Niicidania atfenuata, Ctenodonta sinnosa, and other shells in
shale above the Underset Limestone, nine standards near Kirk by Stephen,

and a very similar fauna at the same horizon on Wild Boar Fell. C.
rectamjularis with an identical fauna is found to be common in the Lower
Limestone. Series of Strathavon and the Upper Limestone series of

--Orchard near Glasgow : a full description of the section and position of

the fossiliferous beds was published at p. 358 in Part IV. of my mono-

gi'aph on ' British Carboniferous Lamellibranchs,' 1899.

--Jieqislration of Ti/pe Specimens of British Fossils. Beport of the

      F. Whidborne, Mr. R. Kidston, Professor H. G. Seeley, Mr. H.

     Woods, a.nd Dr. A. iS. Woodward (Secretanj).

PuBiNG the past year the Committee have received a list of type-fossils in
the Norwich Museum, compiled by INIr. Frank Leney. The Museum of
Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, has published a first instalment of a
list of the type-fossils contained in its collections (' Type Specimens of
Eocene and Oligocene Fossils,' by H. A. Allen, appended to the Annual
Report of the Geological Survey of Great Britain for 1899).

--Ossiferous Caves at Vphill. Report of the Committee, consisting of

     Professor Lloyd Morgan {Chairman), H. Bolton (Secretary),
     Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, Professor S. H. Reynolds, and
      E. T. Newton.

The excavation work of last year was continued until the approach of
winter, by which time the lower caves were worked out, nothing new

being added to the discoveries reported to the Association at the Dover

 meeting.

      The caves were found to lie along the bedding planes of the limestone,
and had clearly formed part of a subterranean drainage system, the
material in them being derived presumably from caves on higher levels.

     Systematic search has been made for caves of habitation higher up the

 hill, but hitherto with no success.

     Work has therefore been arrested. It is hoped to secure a visit and

report from Professor Boyd Dawkins before further exploratory work is
commenced.

     The Committee have, up to the present, incurred an expenditure of
451. 14s. 2c?., 30?. of which has been met by the grant made in 1898 ^t

 Bristol.

     The Committee do not feel justified in requesting a grant for future
work, but they seek reappointment with a grant of 10^. (the sum not

claimed last year) to cover expenses already incurred. It ia their inten-

tion to further examine the ground as quarrying proceeds.

--Erratic Blocks of the British Isles. Rejoort of the Committee, consisting

    Professor T. G. Bonney, Mr. C. E. De Range, Professor W. J.

     Sollas, Mr. R. H. TiDDEMAN, Rev. S. N. Harrison, Mr. J.
     HoRNE, Mr. P. M. Burton, Mr. J. Lomas, Mr. A. B. Dwerry-

    HOUSE, Mr. J. W. Stather, and Mr. W. T. TUCKER. (Drawn vp

       hy the Secretary.')

The records of boulders observed during the past year have been derived

principally from Yorkshire, thanks to the activity of the local organisation

which has for so many years occupied itself with the investigation ; but the

Committee is hopeful that other areas may be subjected to an equally

stringent examination. Work had been commenced in the county of

Durham under the stimulus of an enthusiastic worker, the late Dr. Taylor

Manson, of Darlington ; and though the Committee has to deplore his
removal by death before any definite results were obtained, it is expected

that the movement which he initiated will be productive of valuable

contributions to the knowledge of a rich and scarcely touched field.

    An important advance aflfecting much of the eastern side of England,

and particularly the counties of Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire,

is marked by a visit paid to the Cheviot country by the Yorkshire

Geological and Polytechnic Society at the instigation of members of tlie

Boulder Committee of the county. The object of this excursion was to

study the igneous rocks of the Cheviots, with a view to the recognition

of any erratics of similar types, and to determine how far the ascription

to this source was correct of a series of porphyrites which form a very

considerable proportion of the far travelled boulders of Yorkshire. It

was found that an even larger number of types of erratics could be traced

Ato the Cheviots than had been anticipated.  large number of specimens

were collected, and the Secretary of this Committee will be glad to furnish

sets of examples to any geologists willing to assist in the investigation of

the boulders of the East of England.

   A very important further result was obtained from the excursion.

In the report for 1897 reference was made to the identification by

Professor Brogger of the Sparagmite Sandstone of Scandinavia in a series

of Yoi'kshire eiTatics submitted to him. In subsequent reports occurrences

of a similar rock in various localities in Yorkshire have been mentioned,

but some doubt has been felt regarding the identification, and all such

records have been given with a ' ? '.

This caution has been justified by the discovery that a sandstone

precisely resembling some of the erratics of Yorkshire constitutes a signi-

ficant proportion of the stones in the ' foreign ' drift of the country about

"Wooler and Ingram in the Cheviots. It is referred to in the Geological

Survey Memoirs of the district under the name of ' Greywacke Sandstone,'

and its source is given as in the Silurian area of the Tweed Valley.

The Committee is carrying out the investigation in conjunction with a

Committee of the Yorkshire Geological and Polytechnic Society.
     The present is merely an interim report, as the work is still in

progress.

     It was decided that the first piece of work should consist of an
investigation of the underground flow of water in Ingleborough. This
hill forms with its neighbour, Simon's Fell, a detached massif, which is

peculiarly suitable for investigations of this nature.

     The summit of the group is formed of Millstone Grit, then follow
Yoredale Shales and Sandstones, the whole resting on a plateau of

Carboniferous Limestone.
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF UNDERGROUND WATERS OF CRAVEN. 347

Many streams rise on the upper slopes of the hills and flow over the

Yoredales, but without exception their waters are swallowed directly

they pass on to the Carboniferous Limestone, to reappear as springs in

the valleys which trench the plateau.

The Committee iirst turned its attention to tracing the water which

flows into Gaping Ghyll.

It was generally believed that the water issued at a large spring

immediately above the bridge at Clapham Beck Head and immediately

below the entrance to Ingleborough Cavern.

    On April 28 specimens of the water from this spring were taken for

analysis before the introduction of any test.

    Two cwt. of ammonium sulphate was then put into the water flowing

into Gaping Ghyll, and at the same time the amount of the water was

Agauged and found to be equivalent to 251,856 gallons per diem.              few

hours later a second quantity of two cwt. of the same substance was

introduced.

HOn the same day          lb. of fluorescein in alkaline solution was put

into a pot-hole known as Long Kin East, about 1,300 yards north-east of

Gaping Ghyll.

In view of the important influence which the direction of the joints in

the limestone had been found to exercise over the flow of underground

water, ^ the direction of the joints in the limestone clints in the neighbour-

hood of Long Kin East was taken, and was found to be N.N.W. to

S.S.E., and to run in such a direction as to lead to the probability that

the water would reappear at the springs at the head of Austwick Beck,

and these were consequently watched.

    The ammonium sulphate put in at Gaping Ghyll reappeared at the
large spring at Clapham Beck Head on the morning of May 3, and
continued to flow until the evening of May 6, when the water again
became normal. Thus the time occupied by the ammonium sulphate in

travelling from Gaping Ghyll to Clapham Beck Head, a distance of one

mile, was about five days.

    No ammonium sulphate was found in any of the other springs in

Clapdale.

This result proved beyond doubt that Gaping Ghyll was connected

with Clapham Beck Head.

    The fluorescein put in at Long Kin East showed itself at Austwick

Beck Head, but not at any of the neighbouring springs, on May 11, having

taken over thirteen days to travel, the delay being probably due to the
small amount of water flowing at the time of the expei'iments.

     These results are of considerable importance, as they definitely reveal

two lines of divergent movement of these undergi'ound waters, and
indicate a subterranean watershed of much interest. The influence of

the master-joints of the Carboniferous Limestone in determining the

direction of flow of these underground waters was also, as at Malham,

clearly shown.

     The next set of experiments was carried out by the joint Committee
on June 8 and following days.

     In order to confirm the results in connection with the Gaping Ghyll

to Clapham Beck Head flow, and further to ascertain more definitely if

348 REPORT-- 1900.

there existed any connection, between Gaping Ghyll and the smaller

springs in Clapdale, 10 cwt. of common salt was put into the waters
of Gaping Ghyll on June 4, and a further 10 cwt. on June 5, samples

of the water from each of the springs being taken several times a day
until June 25.

     One pound of fluorescein in alkaline solution was introduced into the
stream flowing through Ingleborough Cave on June 8 at 10 P.M., at the
point where the water plunges down a hole in the floor of the cave, and
marked ' Abyss ' in the 6-inch Ordnance map.

     Five cwt. of ammonium sulphate was introduced into a sink on The
Allotment about 500 yards N.E. of Long Kin East on June 9, at 3 p.m. ;

and at 3.15 p.m. on the same day 1 lb. of fluorescein in alkaline solution
was poured into the stream which flows past the shooting-box on The

Allotment and sinks near the Bench Mark 1320"1.
     The fluorescein introduced into the abyss came out at Clapham Beck

Head, and possibly at Moses "Well and other springs in Clapdale, but this
point requires further investigation, the evidence being as yet somewhat

unsatisfactory.

     The salt from Gaping Ghyll appeared at Clapham Beck Head on June
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, being at its maximum on June 18, but not

at any of the other springs.

     The ammonium sulphate put into the sink on The Allotment appeared
at Austwick Beck Head on June 22, the other springs in the neighbour-

 hood being unafiected on that day ; but on the 24th and 25th there were
 slight increases in the amount of ammonia in two small springs in Clap-

dale, viz. the small spring below Clapdale Farm, and Cat Hole Sike. As

 one of these streams is close to the farmyard, and the other was at the
 time nearly dry and flowing through pasture-land, no importance is

 attached to these slight increases.

      Of the fluorescein put in below the shooting-box no trace has since
 been found, and the same is the case with ^ lb. of methylene blue intro-

 duced into Grey Wife Sike, above Newby Cote.

       Several most interesting problems still await solution in this area, one
 of them being the relations of the Silurian floor, which underlies the
 Carboniferous Limestone of the plateau, to the flow of undergi'ound water.

      The two sinks Gaping Ghyll and Long Kin East are only about 1,300
 yards apart, and yet the waters of the one take a direction quite distinct
 from those of the other, and eventually emerge in a separate valley, the
 distance between the springs being 1^ miles, the great mass of Carboni-
 ferous Limestone known as Norber, a hill upwards of 1,300 feet in height,
 lying between the two valleys.

      In Crummack Dale it is seen that the Silurian rocks form a ridge
 running in an approximately N.W. and S.E. direction, and unconformably

 overlain by the Carboniferous Limestone.
       If this line be continued it separates the Gaping Ghyll to Clapham

 Beck Head flow from that of Long Kin East to Austwick Beck Head.
       Thus it appears that this ridge of Silurian rocks forms an underground

  water-parting, which the Committee hopes to be able to trace further

  across the area.

       The magnitude of this undei'taking will be to some extent realised
  when it is stated that upwards of 400 samples of water have been tested
 for common salt, ammonia, and fluorescein, making in all upwards of

  1,200 tests.
       ON THE MOVEMENTS OF UNDERGROUND WATERS OF CRAVEN. 349

     The whole of the grant of iOl. has been spent upon the investigation,
and a small sum in addition.

     The experiments which have been carried out have indicated which
are the most suitable reagents for use in different cases, and it is conse-
quently hoped that future investigations will be carried out at rather less
cost than has been the case up to the present.

     The Committee asks to be reappointed, with a grant of 601.

Mh --Irish
Remains. Fourth Report of the Committee, consisting of

Professoi* W. Boyd Dawkins (Chairman), the late Deemster

Gill, Rev. Canon Savage, Mr. G. W. Lamplugh, and Mr.

P. M. C. K.EB.U0T)E(Sec7'etary), appointed to examine the Conditions

under ivhich Remains of the Irish Elk are found in the Isle of

Man. (JDravm up lyij the Secretary.')

The Committee deeply regret the loss in October last of one of their

number, Deemster Gill, by whose pressing desire it was that the first
excavation was made near St. John's in 1897, when their efforts were
rewarded by the discovery of the perfect skeleton of ' Irish Elk ' now in

Castle Rushen.'

     The following paragraph was added to our last report after it was in
type, and the bone in question exhibited at our Dover meeting, but by
some accident it was omitted from the report as published, so we insert

it here. ' At a depth of about nine feet below the surface, at the bottom
of the silt (Bed C of our first report), and just above the white Chara-

marl, were found two fragments of bone, which were forwarded to out

Chairman, who has identified one as the scapula of Bos longifrons, and

in a letter to the Secretary adds : "This establishes the presence in the
island of an animal which was domesticated and introduced into the

 British Isles in the Neolithic age. It proves that this deposit in
 which it occurs is not earlier than the Neolithic age." '

     At the end of October last another trench, 12 yards by 3, was cut

 across the Loughan ruy, Ballaugh,^ parallel to and about 2 yards north-

west of that of last year. At a point about 4 yards from the north-east

 end the marl was found at a depth of 10 feet 3 inches, just over a foot
 deeper than in last year's trench, showing the dip towards the north-west.

      In the peat, which extended from the surface to a depth of 3 feet,
 were several pieces of timber, the largest being about 1 5 inches diameter at
 the root : this bed rested upon silt, which extended to a further depth of
 7 feet. It varied slightly in different parts, here more sandy, there moi'e
 loamy, but was reaUy all one bed, the bottom of which consisted chiefly of

 small fiat water-worn stones. At a depth in this bed of 6 feet, that is to

 say, about 9 feet from the surface, was a layer of leaves about half an inch

  thick.

       In this layer, on the south-east side of the trench, about 3 yards from
 its south-west end, was found a fragment of antler, thickly covered with
 the blue phosphate which appears to be confined to this leaf-deposit. All
  around it were minute decayed fragments of bone or antler.

       Three or four yards away, at a depth of 10 feet from the surface,

' See Report 189S.                     - Ibid., 1897.
  3'SO REPORT-- 1900.

  being about 3 inches from the white marl bed, but distinctly in the silt,
  was another fragment of antler : this was in the north-west side of the
  trench, and about a yard from its south-west end.

       The marl was struck at a depth of 10 feet to 10 feet 3 inches ; and at a
  point from 9 to 12 inches within it, that is to say, about 11 feet below
  the present surface, there was still another antler fragment, some 3 yards
  further south-east than the last, in the south-west end of the trench.
 Immediately below this the marl was bluish black, exactly as it was
  round the head of the skeleton found near St. John's (Close-y-Garcy).
 This darkened marl was from 9 to 10 inches thick, and extended over an
 area from the south-west end of tlie trench of about 3 feet square. All
 through it were crumbs of decayed bones, doubtless ' Irish Elk.'

      Beport of the Committee, consisting of Professor James GeIkie
      {Chairman), Professor T. G. BonneV, Dr. Tempest Anderson,
      Mr. Godfrey Bingley, Mr. H. CoaTEs, Mr. C. V. Crook, Mr.
      E. J. Garwood, Mr. J. G. Goodchild, Mr. William Gray, Mr.

      Mr. R. Welch, Mi*. H. B. Woodward, Mr. F. Woolnough,

     and Professor W. W. Watts {Secretary). {Drawn up by the

        Secretary.)

 The Committee have the honour to report that during the year 309 new
 photographs have been received, bringing the total number in the collec-

 tion to 2,655.

      In addition to this 12 prints and 10 slides have been given to the
 duplicate collection, making a total of 331 photographs received during

 the year.

      Five misplaced prints have been renewed by the kindness of Miss
 Andrews, Mr. Brown, Mr. Coomara-Swamy, and Mr. Bingley.

      The usual scheme showing the geographical distribution of photographs
is appended. There are no new counties in the list except Anglesey and

--Meath, but the following counties are now much better represented than

hitherto : Buckingham, Essex, Gloucester, Somerset, Pembroke, Inver-
ness, and Clare. The scheme of the main collection has been most
carefully checked with the prints, catalogues, and printed lists, all doubtful

numbers have been weeded out, and it may be taken to represent

accurately the actual state of the collection. Eor this reason it is not
quite consistent with previous schemes, when these precautions have not
been possible. Three photographs have been assigned to old numbers,
namely, 191, 399, and 400, and the missing photographs hitherto assigned
to these numbers cancelled.

     Mr. A. S. Reid has continued his photographic survey of the Island of
Eigg and contributed a set of photographs taken there.

     Mr. Greenly sends a valuable set of photographs taken under the
auspices of a Committee of the Association in order to preserve a reliable
and unbiassed record of the disappearing sections of elevated drifts on
Moel Tryfaen, in Carnarvonshire.

     Mr. Coomara-Swamy contributes a considerable series taken on the
mainland of Inverness and in Skye,
ON PHOTOGRAPHS OF GEOLOGICAL INTEREST.  351

     Mr. S. H. Reynolds has illustrated the recent work of himself and
Mr. Gardiner at Clogher Head with a group of admirable photographs,
and he also sends groups from the areas of Clifton, Bath, and the Dorset-
shire coast. Mr. Monckton also contributes photographs from the last
district and several others.

ai-e given in List III. Twelve prints and ten slides have been received,

Aand the whole collection now numbers 336 prints and 111 slides.  list

of donors to this collection is appended to the list, and to each of them

the Committee expi-ess their thanks.

     The duplicate collection has been sent to the following Societies during

--the year : The Limerick Field Club, the Leeds Geological Association,

the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, the South-Eastern Union of Scien-
tific Societies, the Faraday Society of the Morley Memorial College, and

the annual conversazione of the Birmingham Philosophical and Natural

History Society.

   A request was received from the Science and Art Department that

the Committee would exhibit a typical series of geological photographs at

the Paris Exhibition. An appeal was sent to photographers, who

Aresponded with their usual readiness.  small set was got together and

sent to Paris, where it is now exhibited. It has received the award of a

--silver medal in Class XII. The following contributed prints or lent

negatives for this purpose : Mr. R. Welch, Mr. Godfrey Bingley, Mr. A.

Strahan, Mr. C. A. Defieux, Mr. C. J. Watson, Mr. A. A. Armstrong,

Mr. A. K. Coomara-Swamy, Mr. A. S. Reid, Mr. R. McF. Mure, Mr. H.

L. P. Lowe, Dr. F. J. Allen, Mr. W. Jerome Harrison, and Mr. W. T.

Tucker.

The question of publishing a typical series of geological photographs

has been considered by the Committee, and as a sufficient number of

subscribers has been obtained it has been decided to proceed to the issue

of twenty photographs annually for three years, both as prints and lantern

Aslides.  committee of selection, consisting of Professor Bonney, Mr.

Garwood, Dr. Mill, Mr. Teall, Mr. H. B. Woodward, and the Secretary,

has made a provisional selection of representative photographs. It is
hoped that the first set may be issued within the year. The subscribers*

list includes a large number of foreigners and colonials. The list v/ill be

closed on September 12, 1900.

Applications by local societies for the loan of the duplicate collection

should be made to the Secretary. Either prints or slides, or both, can be

lent, with a descriptive account of the slides. The carriage, and the

making good of any damage to slides or prints, are expenses borne by the

borrowing society.

    ELEVENTH LIST OF GEOLOGICAL PHOTOGRAPHS.

                                 (To AuGtsT 25, 1900.)

     This list contains the geological photographs which have been
received by the Secretary of the Committee since the publication of the
last Report. Photographers are asked to affix the registered numbers,
as given below, to their negatives for convenience of future reference.

Their own numbers are added in order to enable them to do so.

      Copies of photographs desired can, in most instances, be obtained
from the photographer direct, or from the officers of the Local Society
under whose auspices the views were taken.

     The price at which copies may be obtained depends on the size of the

print and on local circumstances over which the Committee have no control.
     The Committee do not assume the copyricjht of any pliotographs

included in this list. Inquiries respecting photographs, and applications
              ON PHOTOGRAPHS OF GEOLOGICAL INTEREST.                  855

for permission to reproduce them, should be addressed to the photographers

direct.

     The very best photographs lose half their utility, and all their value

as documentary evidence, unless accurately described ; and the Secretary

would be grateful if, whenever possible, such explanatory details as can

be given were written on the forms supplied for the purpose, and not on

the back of tlie pltotograpli or ehetvliere. Much labour and error of tran-
Ascription would thereby be saved.
                                      local number by which the print

can be recognised should be written on the back of the photograph and on

the top right-hand corner of the form.

    Copies of photographs should be sent unmounted to W. W. Watts,
Mason University College, Birmingham, and forms may be obtained from

him.

The size of photographs is indicated as follows :

      L = Lantern size.               1/1= Whole plate.

      1/4 = Quarter-plate.            10/8 = 10 inches by 8.

      1/2 = Half -plate.              12/10 = 12 inches by 10, &c.

                            E signifies Enlargements.

* indicates that photographs and slides may be purchased from the donors, or

obtained through the address given with the series.

On the Geological Age of the Earth. By Professor J. Joly, D.Sc, F.E.S.

                [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

On account of a certain small amount of arithmetical complexity involved

in the statement of the method of estimating the age of the earth by
solvent denudation, I have had a brief summary of it put into print, all

the quantities involved being calculated into the metricid system of units

(see Appendix). With this in your hands I may be permitted to leave

figures aside in the few remarks I have to make.

In this method, as the President of the Geological Section has already

stated, the sodium contained in the sea is assumed to be a measure of the

total amount of solvent denudation since the oceans were formed, and

the amount of sodium annually supplied by the rivers is taken as a

Whymeasure of the rate at which this denudation has been effected.

attention is restricted to the sodiiom need not be enlarged upon further

than to say that every other element supplied by solution of the rocks is

again rejected by the sea to an extent which renders it unavailable.

It will be found on reference to the summary that allowance is made

for the efiects of the probable amount of active acid primevally uncom-

bined, on the basis that sensibly the whole o£ the chlorine now in the
ocean was then existent in the form of HCl. This amounts to a sub-

tractive correction of under 6 per cent, on geological time. After con-
sideration of all the facts, I do not think any further concession to the
popular assertion, that 'the sea was salt from the first,' can be made.

   A deduction is also suggested for direct solvent denudation by the sea.

The correction is taken as between 3 and 6 per cent., the basis of correc-
tion being the ratio of the tide- swept area to the total rainy land area,
and some experiments which appear to show that over the same area of
rock surface the rate of marine solution cannot be more than twenty times
the rate of atmospheric denudation These experiments are communicated
to this Section. They are somewhat incomplete, but their rough indica-
tion may be accepted as sufficient for the present purpose.

     Allowance is also made for the transport of sodium from the sea to the
rivers through the atmosphere. Data are required in order to define this

allowance more precisely.
     The brief review of the method before you also refers to the rock-salt

deposits. These appear to be quite negligible compared with the enormous

mass of chloride of sodium row in the ocean-- suflicient to cover the entire

land area to a depth of 122 metres--unless deposits of this substance, far
greater than anything at present dreamt of, are discovered.

     Some other possible sources of error are considered, but these will more

fitly be referred to further on.

  -- --It is a confirmation of the general validity of the method that accept-

ing with slight modifications -Mr. Mel lard Reade's estimate of the total
mass of detrital sediments, and a mean soda content of these sediments,

based on a very considerable number of analyses, we find that the resulting

total mass of contained sodium added to the soda equivalent of the sodium

now in the ocean suffices to restore to the adequate mass of parent
igneous rock a soda percentage approximately equal to that of the mean

igneous ci'ust-rock of the earth. In other words what sodium is con-
tained in the ocean is approximately equal to the amount which would
have been wasted from such a mean igneous rock upon its degradation

into the probable mass of detrital sediments.

     Finally we find the method affords on the basis of the best data

available a duration since subaerial denudation began of between ninety

and one hundred millions of years.

      Professor Sollas has really referred to the weakest point in this estimate

when lie questions the sufficiency of the data affording the annual river
supply of sodium. However, there is much reason to believe that the

--nineteen rivers-- a fair admixture of great and small ones aflbrd an

approximation to the nature of what the world's rivers yield in the form
of dissolved matter to the ocean. The want emphasises Professor Sollas's
demand for more experiment, and Sir Archibald Geikie's for geological
co-operation. The data required are really of the easiest to obtain.

     The method is, of course, based on the principle of uniformity, but the
generalised nature of the measure of uniformity a,ct\i3l\y reqxaived is worthy
of attention. The claim is restricted to the association of atmospheric
loater and of rock over a surface of land approximately equal to the

present rainy area of the globe, the climatic conditions doubtless differing
in each geographical region from age to age, but on the whole preserving

an approximate uniformity in denudative effect, as measured, say, by the
solvent denudative work accomplished per million of years.
ox THE GEOLOGICAL AGE OF THE EARTH.  371

    How far will this measure of uniformity be conceded ? Whether

crystalline or sedimentary rocks jwevail does not appear seriously involved

in the long run, for we find soils derived from the latter actually exposing

larger amounts of alkaline silicates : the higher resistance to disintegra-

tion offered by the crystalline rocks often conferring upon their soils the
role of an exhausted and protective covering. Again, it is only within

fairly wide limits a question of climate, for the rate of solution of the
silicates is so slow that the amount of the solvent present is of less import-
ance than its persistent operation even in minute quantities. The rate of
solution would certainly not increase proportionately to the amount of the
solvent, a very wet climate being very possibly, even probably, less

effective than a warm and damp climate more rarely visited by rains.
    As regards the rainy area exposed to SHhai'rial denudation during past

geological periods, considerable latitude with respect to the effects of up-
heaval or depression is suggested by the fact that the supply of water
evaporated by the ocean is to-day insufficient to ensure drainage from
more than four-fifths the total land area. If to-day 10 per cent, of

the land subsided beneath the ocean, probably but a small change in the

river discharge of dissolved matter would I'esult. The disappearance of
this 10 per cent, of the land would increase the oceanic area but 4 per
cent., and the ' rainless ' areas of the continents would diminish to one-
tenth the total land surface. In short, the rainy margins would

--roughly speaking move inwards. In the opposite case, that of upheaval,

the rainy margin will move outwards. Tlius the deposition or upheaval
of our greatest sedimentary masses was not necessarily accompanied by
any notable variation in the supply of dissolved matter to the sea.

     In short, it would appear that changes of a quite abnormal or cata-
strophic nature must be looked for to seriously affect the average rate of
the operations at Avork. I must refer to the evidence for and against .such

effects.

    As regards hydrothermal actions, due to lingering heat in the primitive

oceans, on Lord Kelvin's figures for the rate of cooling this action must be
negligible. If his figures were multiplied even tenfold, the error could

hardly at most amount to 1 per cent. I may also now refer to the
objection urged by Professor SoUas, that underground temperature may for

long have given rise to a geyser-like action of springs which would have
enriched the sodium supply of the early rivers. If of a serious character
this objection should be supported by more evidence of such solvent actions
than our most ancient sediments reveal. Thus it is remarkable that so far
from the earliest sediments or their probable metamorphosed remains
being the most washed-out of the rocks they are often those possessing the
largest percentages of alkalies. The oldest Cambrian and Silurian sedi-
ments and gneissic rocks of archsean age and probable sedimentary origin
show percentages of alkalies almost comparable to those of the mean
igneous earth-crust and exceeding the average of later sediments and of
sediments at present beiug deposited. I therefore cannot think that any
exceptional solvent actions applied to these sediments when being deposited
or when buried or subsequently when uplifted and exposed to atmo-
spheric denudation can be generally assumed. Gey.ser actions or circula-
tion of underground waters among unfaulted primitive igneous rocks, on
the other hand, would arise only under exceptional conditions. And,

again, we may ask, where in the earlier igneous rock-masses have we

evidence of exceptional geyser-like actions 1

                                                                                                                  BB3

    I may point out here that Daubree's experiments by no means support

the view that crystalline rocks are rapidly attacked by superheated water,

but rather demonstrate the contrary. At a pressure which Daubree esti-

mated at more than 1,000 atmospheres, and at a red heat, water failed to

appreciably attack, after many weeks, sanidine, oligoclase, pyroxene, or

potash mica. The contrary is generally inferred from the general atten-
tion which has been paid to his experiments on glass and obsidian. The
early igneous rock crust from the general prevalence of conditions of slow
cooling would almost certainly have been highly crystalline.

     The notion that exce2)tionaf vidcmisiu prevailed in the earliest times
appears unproved. The traps and dykes of archa!ai\ rocks are not always

--evidence of subacrial outbursts the Lewisian and Torridonian rocks of

Scotland may be quoted as examples, where, although there is much injec-

tion of igneous matter, there is no evidence of corresponding volcanic action.

And, again, it may be well questioned, granting even excessive volcanic
action, how far it would affect the methodical supply to the ocean of dis-

solved alkalies by the rivers.

    Early tides of gigantic height have been rather discredited. Any one

reading Professor G. Darwin's delightful book on ' Tides ' will be struck

with the caution and moderation of the writer. He maintains ' the pos-
sibility that a considerable part of the changes due to tidal friction may

have occurred within geological history,' yet thinks it ' probable that the
greater part of the changes due to tidal friction must be referred back to

pi-e-geological times when the planet was partially or entirely molten.'

Tliis involves, of course, that the epoch of most violent activity prevailed

in pre-geological times before the work of denudation had begun. And
here, again, even admitting higher tides, it may be seriously asked on

what grounds we assume such higher tides to effect solvent denudation

positively rather than negatively. If the tides of to-day rose so as to
encroach five miles further on the coasts, would the loss of soil area re-
sulting compensate for the gain of bare superficial rock swept by the sea ?

A soil but 10 cms. deep may expose an area 50,000 times its superficial area

to the solvent actions of hygroscopic water and rain, CO.^, organic acids, »fec.
      Professor Perry, writing in ' Natm'e,' has suggested the possibility of

diminished sun-heat at a period as recent as some 50 x 10'' years ago. But
so far as I know, Professor Perry has not gone further than to suggest

the possibility of this external interference with the orderly succession of

 events in the earth.

      But finally in regard to all these surmises, interesting and valuable as
 they undoubtedly are, can I do better than to refer to Sir A. Geikie's reading
 of rock-testimony on this point 1 Sir A. Geikie seeks one hundred million
 years as sufficient for the sedimentary history of the earth. His words are

--recent dating from his address to the Geological Section last year. The

 evidence of the sedimentary rocks, he affirms, shows no more stupendous
 mountain upheavals, volcanic eruptions, or greater violence in the sur-
 rounding envelopes of atmosphere and ocean than occurred in more recent

 periods or than we are acquainted with to-day. ' Even in the most

 ancient of the sedimentary registers of the world's history not only is
 there no evidence of colossal floods, tides, and denudation, but there is

 incontestable proof of continuous orderly deposition such as may be
 witnessed to-day in any quarter of the globe. The same tale with endless
 additional detail is told all through the stratified formations down to those

 which are in course of accumulation at the present day,'

If now tlie sodiuiii-methocl affords a correct key to the age of the earth,

Andit remains to criticise methods yielding discordant results.                                                       first, as

I'egards the method by rate of deposition, we find Sir A. Geikie claiming

a period, as we have seen, in perfect accord with that shown by solvent

denudation. Professor Sollas, however, considers the actual record indicates

a shorter period. I think, however, he has very fully and fairly shown

that much difficulty attends the actual measurements as well as the

application of the measurements.

    In the first place it may be observed that the data have been obtained

from an inadequate number of rivers. Again, the detrital matter discharged

by rivers is most difficult to estimate, owing to the rapid variation of

transporting power with current-velocity, and also owing to the fact that

a very large amount of sediment is transported by creeping along the river

bed. Both these facts render measurement so difficult that only the most

painstaking observations could be relied on for an approximate estimate.

And suppose we possessed the required estimate of detrital material, how
are we to dispose of it so as to represent what we may call the average
mode of maximum deposition ? Some rivers form deltas which creep out-

ward year by year. Here the rate of deposition is evidently not balanced

by subsidence. There is in fact no one law of deposition, nor can there

be. Once more, can we ever know the total maximum thickness of the

sediments 1 It must be that the sediments of one period supply in great

part those of the next. The very quantity we estimate in the rivers in

order to find our denominator has been robbed, perchance, from our

numerator. Have we, in fact, when all care is taken, measured the true
maximum thickness, or would sediments long ago removed afford vastly

greater maxima 1 Now observe the method is exposed, here at its weakest

point, mainly to errors of deficiency : and the method in its latest develop-

ment, in the able hands of Professor Sollas, aftbrds but some twenty-six

millions of years, and according to Mr. Wallace twenty-eight millions of

years.

There is another method based on biological progress which seems

to go to the opposite extreme and claims immense periods of time.

Lyell claimed on biological grounds 240 millions of years since the

Cambrian                                                           Haughton,  200  millions ;  Darwin  speaks  of  a  pre-Cambrian
                                                                ;

period as long as the sum of the subsequent geological ages. Professor

Sollas has, with justifiable authority, dealt with this matter. And indeed

we may well ask if the argument does not assume an unwarranted

proportionality in the rates of evolution throughout successive ages.

Surely the organism of later date owes something of its stability to

heredity 1

Ca]\ we assume tliat when trial was less likely to be attended with

error, owing to a less severe competition, species and genera were not

struck off more rapidly than later under more restricted conditions, and
when ages of increasing restraints had impressed upon the gei'm-plasm a

more stereotyped heredity ? It appears difficult to imagine that the
organism as we see it to-day so willing to take advantage of every loop-

hole and fill up every vacancy should have dropped its opportunist

character in early times and failed to profit by the more generous

environment. If this is so, can we accept with Huxley the period

required for the development of the horse as an indication of the length

of the history of ungulates 1 But this argument has been taken up

already l.iy Mr. Adam Sedgwick, who has urged that in the evolution
37i REPORT-- 1900.

of heredity a I'econciliation of the demands of biologists and the restric-
tions placed by the physicist on geological time may be found. His
address to the Zoological Section last year will be fresh in the minds of
all, and I need not further press the point.

     Turning to physical methods we have Professor Darwin's age of the
moon, suggesting a minimum of fifty-seven millions of years, to which
Professor Sollas has referred. Lord Kelvin's method, based on the rate of
cooling of the globe and the observed fall of temperature in the terrestrial

crust, depends for the accuracy of its indication on data regarding the
physical properties of the deeper- lying materials of the earth which we do
not ay yet possess. This has been fully discussed lately by Professor
Perry. The distinguished author of the method has at no time denied
the restrictions placed by our present ignorance on the indications of the
method. The eflfect is not to deprive the method of value, but to restrict
its present functions to the delimitation of certain bounds to our

speculations, which bounds may on the minor estimate be taken as some

twenty millions of years, but which may, according to the density, specific
heat, and conductivity of the deeper-lying materials at elevated tempera-

tures, allow of a much moi'e extended estimate.
     It must be admitted that no one method of approaching the delicate

question of the age of the earth can claim to Imve reached that con-

sistentior status which we look for in scientific results. So much may

possibly have happened during the long past vista which it is hoped to

penetrate that more than a considerable degree of probability may never

be attained by our results. Admitting this, I have to appear perhaps in

the light of an advocate when I state my belief that the method by solvent

denudation is not discredited by the conclusions arrived at by other
methods, in so far as these assign major or minor limits to the age of the
earth, and that none other approaches the question so directly or on such

easily obtained data.

                     [Read before the Congres Geologique International, I'JOO.]

     The method of determining the age of the earth summarised in this
paper is based on the assumption that the ocean has retained substantially
the whole of the sodium committed to it by the solvent denudation of
geological time, and that the supply of the element sodium by the rivers
has on the whole lieen uniform in rate.^

     Hence we derive as a numerator a number expressing the mass of

sodium at present in the ocean, and a denominator expressing in the same
units the amount of this element annually discharged into the ocean by

the rivers of the world.

     The quotient is the geological age of the earth.
     Corrections are applied to both numerator and denominator for any
certain or very probable source of error. These corrections are approxi-
mate only, upper and lower limits of their values being suggested. ^

    ' No other dissolved substance in the ocean conforms to the first of these con-

ditions.

                                   First Approximation to a Numerator.

     According to Professor Dittmar/ if the ocean has a total mass of
1-343 X 10''* tonnes, the sodium chloride in it amounts to 36,566 xlO'^
tonnes. However, on Professor Wagner's- estimate of the area of the
land surface of the globe as 14,456 x 10' square kilometres, and the ratio
of the areas of water and land as 2-54 : 1, and on Sir John Murray's

estimate^ of the mean depth as 3 851 kilometres, the total mass is more
correctly 1-458x10'** tonnes. On these data we can readjust Professor
Dittmar's estimate of the mass of NaCl in the ocean, finding it to be
39,703 X 10'- tonnes, and from this finally arrive at the result that the

mass of sodium in the ocean is 15,611 xlO'^ tonnes.

                                 First Approximation to a Denojtiinator.

    On Sir John Murray's estimate ^ the river water annually discharged

into the ocean amounts to a volume of 27,191 cubic kilometres, and from

--his table of the mean dissolved constituents of nineteen rivers many of
--them principal rivers of the world we find that a cubic kilometre of

average river water contains as sodium salts 7753 tonnes of NaoSO^, 6534

tonnes of NaNOa, and 4061 tonnes of NaCl. Calculating from these the
masses of sodium in each case, and multiplying by the total number of
cubic kilometres, we arrive at 15,976 x 10' tonnes as the total mass of

sodium carried annually into the sea by the rivers.
     The quotient is a first approximation to the age of the earth, and is

97-6 millions of years.

                                         Correction on the Denominator,

      It is convenient to consider this first.

     The mass of sodium chloride carried by the rivers is in part derived
from the ocean by means of the atmospheric transportation of this sub-
stance from the ocean and its precipitation in rain water. Ten per cent.

is allowed as a sufficient deduction for this circulation of the chloride of

sodium. The allowance is thus restricted for the reason that while near
the coasts a very considerable portion, and even sensibly the whole, of the

chloride of sodium may be so derived, in inland areas the amounts of the

salt which fall in rain become very minute.'' It is just in these inland
areas that the chief rivers of the world derive their supplies.

     Applying this correction to the NaCl of the rivers, the corrected river
discharge of sodium is left at 15,542 x 10' tonnes.

with hydrogen. The resulting acid wc assume as probably contained in

Athe original atmosphere and hydrosphere.     primitive accelerated

denudation can be computed on the basis of the probable mass of chloride

of hydrogen and the nature of the lithosphere exposed to attack. The

effects concern the present method only so far as they result in supplying

sodium to the ocean.

The maximum amount of chlorine available as an acid basis may be

derived from the chlorine now in the ocean less what was supplied during

geological time by solution of the rocks.

Referring to Sir John Murray's table/ we deduce from the amounts

of chlorides supplied annually by river discharge '·^ (applying the deduction

of 10 per cent, before mentioned to the sodium chloride) that the rivers

contribute annually 75-5 x 10^ tonnes of chlorine. If now our final esti-

mate of the earth's age is 0-5 x 1 O*" years, the total supply by denudation

lias been 7169 x 10^ tonnes of chlorine.

The total mass of chlorine now in the ocean, calculated on Professor

Dittmar's table and the more recent estimate of the mass of the ocean

(ante) less the amount calculated as above as supplied by tlie rivers sub-

sequently, is 21,123 X 10'- tonnes.-* This amount we assume free to act

as a primeval denuding agent.

According to Mr. F. W. Clarke * the older crust of the earth contained

the following atomic ^percentages, which would be converted to chlorides

by a primeval denudation such as we assume :

present in tlie abundance thought by some, its early effects were jDrobably

compensated by the more active effects of organic acids of later times.

Vegetation, too, has been a source of carbonic acid in the soils during

subsequent periods. It may be observed that the fixation of free CO^ by

vegetation so abundantly in the later Palaeozoic and the increase in the

deposits of limestone rather point to a gradual fixation of this substance

than to any special activity as a solvent in earlier times. On these

accounts we make no correction for the possible presence of this substance

in primeval times.

Rock solution in heated waters persisted for periods relatively so short

as to cause negligible error only. According to Lord Kelvin's calculation

as to the rate of cooling of the solidifying crust, a period of a century

would have been adequate to cool the crust from its melting-point down

to about 8° Centigrade above what it would be without any under-

ground heat. Hence, if the mean rate of solvent denudation was as
much as a thousand times what it is to-day, the result would have been

theaccomplishment of 100,000 years' denudation in the first hundred years.
If now we even lengthened the period of this excessive denudation, ten

times the correction would be no more than about 1 per cent.

  --(b) For Direct Marine Denudation. So far as the sea has directly

acted on the coasts, and on the sediments deposited in it, an error is in-

troduced calling for a subtractive correction on our estimate of geological

time ; in other words, upon our numerator, which is that part of the sodium
in the ocean supplied by sub-aerial denudation only.

The total tide-swept area of the ocean is calculated by Sir J. Murray

and Professor Renard ('Challenger' Report) as 162x10' square kilo-

metres. The ' rainy ' area of the land is about 1 13 x IC' square kilometres.

The ratio of areas is 1 : 700. Hence, the assumption of a marine solvent

denudation having an intensity twenty times that progressing over an

equal area exposed to normal sub-atirial denudation would involve a sub-

tractive correction of rather under 3 per ct-nt. on geological time' The

solvent effects on sediments falling into the nearly, or quite, quiescent

waters beyond this zone are assumed to be small on the grounds of the

rapid flocculation and consolidation of marine sediments, as well as from

the fact that the very minute mineral particles of oceanic sediments show

little of such effects as would arise under conditions of sub-aei'ial denuda-

tion. They preserve, in fact, their soda in substantial excess of their

potash. There is in marine sediments generally almost complete absence

of the moi'e active acid and oxidising effects progressing in the soils. Nor

will the state of consolidation of marine sediments allow us to assume

anything like the enormous surface area, as much as 500 square metres

per litre, e.xposed within the soils.

    On these grounds it is assumed that the correction should not exceed

6 per cent., nor be less than 3 per cent.

Our numerator was left at 14,694 x 10'- tonnes, and our denominator

at 15,.542 x 10^ tonnes. The resulting age of the earth would be 94 x 10"
Ayears.
         subtractive correction of 4 per cent, for marine denudation

leaves the geological age at 90 x 10'' years. Future extension of our

knowledge on the many points raised will, however, modify this number.
Thus, according to Professor De Lapparent's - more recent estimation of

ments on Denudation in Fresh and Salt Water.'

the volume of the ocean, its mass is 1-539 x 10^^ tonnes. This would raise
our result by nearly 6 per cent.

   We sum up the results of our inquiry, then, in the statement that the

probable age of the earth, estimated from solvent denudation, is between
ninety and one hundred millions of years.

        Sock-salt Deposits from the Ocean negligible.

The amount of chloride of sodium in the ocean is sufficient to cover

the entire land area with a layer of solid salt 122 metres deep. Compared

with so great a mass the rock-salt deposits on the land are negligible.

They are, moreover, only in part derived from the ocean, the circumstances

leading to abstraction of salt from the ocean and its retention upon the

land being exceptional. Likeness in chemical composition is no proof

that bedded salts were derived from the ocean. Thus the proportions of

salts in the Great Salt Lake are much the same as in the sea.^

So far as these deposits  are derived  from  the denudation                                                        '

                                                             of ' rainless

regions, and are being gradually conveyed by rivers to the ocean, they

constitute part of the normal supply of sodium to the sea.

                                     Unifonnity of sub-aerial Denudation.

     The uniformitarianism involved in the present mode of calculating the

age of the earth is broadly restricted to the approximate persistence
throughout the past of the present sub-aerial association of water and

rock.

     The rate of solution of the rock -forming silicates is so slow that the
abundance of the solvent or its rate of renewal is a relatively unimportant
factor compared with the surface area exposed. Thus within certain

limits climate will not seriously affect the question.

     The existence of a rainless area, amounting to one-fifth the land
surface, subject to extreme conditions of dryness secures that subsidence

or elevation of land does not necessarily involve corresponding changes in
the area of active solvent denudation, In the first case the more active
margin moves inwards, in the second case it moves outwards.

     The argument that the surface materials of the land areas must have
been growing poorer in alkalies throughout geological time is met by the

fact of the less resistent nature of sedimentary rocks, involving soils richer
in soluble constituents. These are, in fact, more rapidly formed and
removed. Observation shows that on comparing soils from the most
diverse kinds of rocks the rapidly concentrated soils of limestones, or
those derived from sandstones, very generally exceed in percentage of
alkalies soils derived from igneous rocks.- It is within the soils that the

chief work of solvent denudation is accomplished.

       Confirmation in the Soda-content of the Igneous and Sedimentary HocJcs.

   We assume in our present argument necessarily that the sedimentary

rocks were derived from the igneous in the process of denudation, a certain
loss, representing matter gone into solution, occurring. Taking this loss

into account, we may recover from the estimated mass of the siliceous

detrital sedimentaries on the earth's surface the approximate total mass
of the parent igneous rock. This represents a certain mass of soda

     ' Nature, December 28, 1899, p. 204.

(deducible from our knowledge of the mean igneous rock-crust) which is

to be accounted for between what is now represented in the ocean by the
chlorides and what remains over in the detrital sedimentaries. Upon

making the calculations, we find that the sum of the soda in the ocean

and in the sedimentaries would nearly suffice to effect the full restoration

of this constituent to the original rock. There is not quite enough.

The bulk of the siliceous sedimentaries is assumed to be represented

by a layer 1-77 kilometres deep spread over the land area. This on a
specific gravity of 2-5 affords a mass of 64 x lO^*"' tonnes, which we assume

to be 67 per cent, of the mass of the parent rock.'- Hence the parent rock
Wepossessed a mass of 95-5x10"^ tonnes.
                                         restore to this the soda

equivalent of the sodium now in the ocean, 21 '0 x lO''^ tonnes. The

mean soda- content of these sedimentaries determined on the analyses of

over one hundred typical siliceous sedimentary rocks given in Professor

H. Rosenbusch's Elemente cler Gesteinslehre (Stuttgart, 1890) is found to

be 1-47 per cent. This affords 9-4x10'^ tonnes in the layer 1-77 kilo-

metres thick. Restoring this also, the parent mass of igneous rock is

found to have possessed 3-20 per cent, of NaoO. According to Mr.

W.F. Clarke {loc. cit.), the mean igneous rock contains 3-61 per cent, of

soda.

     This approximate agreement between the amount of sodium in the

ocean and that missing from the sedimentary rocks is a confirmation of

the validity of the present mode of deducing the age of the earth. It is
directly opposed to the assumption of an ocean primevally charged with

sodium salts. The negation is the more emphatic, seeing that the loss
revealed by the sedimentary rocks of geological time appears to be

more than sufficient to account for what sodium is to-day in the sea.

The series of periodic surveys for which provision was made at the Bristol

conditions as were described in the First Report of the Committee. Since
the Dover Meeting two surveys were carried out, viz., in November 1899,
and in the first week of March 1900, thus making five quarterly surveys

altogether.

     It has been found impossible to finish the examination of the large
quantity of material collected in time for report at the Bradford Meeting.
The Committee therefore desire to be reappointed (without a grant) in

order that they may present their final report at the Glasgow Meeting.

On entering upon the yeui's occupancy of the Naples Table the advis-

ability suggested itself of sending a circular letter to teachers and others
likely to recommend workers ; and as the result a greater number of

applications were received than it was possible to grant. Among those

which were entertained no fewer than three ultimately overlapped during
spring, and the best thanks of the Committee are hereby tendered to Dr.
Dohrn for his magnanimity, exceeding all precedent, in having arranged
for the accommodation of all woi'kers recommended, this notwithstanding.

The indebtedness of the Committee is further increased by his having, on
their behalf, granted Professor Ramsay Wright, of the University of
Toronto, permission to .spend the leisure of two months' residence in Naples
in tlie study of the methods of capture and preservation in vogue in tho

bay, witli a view to their application at tlie New CJanadian Marine

fStation, the project for which received the support of the British Asso-

ciation. And this has been further increased by his having allowed Miss

A. Vickers to collect seaweeds between October and January, on the
recommendation of the Committee.

     The list of British woi-kers at the Naples Station which accompanies
this Report exceeds, as regards numbers, all previous records, while that

of naturalists of other countries reaches for the year seventy-four in all,

bringing the total of those who have profited by the resources of the
establishment since 1873-74, when Professor Waldeyer and the late
Francis Maitland Balfour began work there, to nearly 1,200 persons.

     The recent addition to the laboratory of a filter, by which half the

sea-water in circulation in the tanks is filtered and «eparatcd from

the rest, has materially increased the facilities for experimental work
now gi'eatly in vogue ; and the fishing capacity is now sufficient to provide
from fifty to sixty workers at a time with all requisite material. In every
department of the establishment, laboratory and library alike, thorough
efficiency and complete success have to be recorded.

     Your Committee hereby apply for a renewal of the grant of 100^. to
enable Mr. H. H. Stewart, M.A., to work at the Annelids, and to aid him

and other competent researchers whom it is hoped to secure to study these
and other organisms they may desire to investigate.

of the Table.

APPENDIX I.

Note by the Chairman of the British Association Committee.

As it is about ten years since a Chairman of this Committee visited

the Naples Zoological Station, and reported on the condition of the insti-

tution,^ it may serve a useful purpose to draw attention here to the facili-

ties for work at this world-renowned laboratory, and to the additions and

improvements effected during the last decade. I am indebted to Dr.

Dohrn, the Director, and to the Secretary, Mr. Linden, for much informa-

tion given me during my recent visit.

Since Dr. Sclater's visit in 1890 additional accommodation has been

obtained by a re-arrangement of the roof of the main building. This

gives space for a second laboratory, a supplementary library, and various

smaller rooms used as chemical and physiological laboratories, for photo-
Agraphy and bacteriology.
                           good deal of the research in recent years,

both on the part of those occupying tables and of the permanent staff,

has been in the direction of comparative physiology, experimental embryo-

logy, and the bacteriology of sea-watei', and all necessar^^ facilities for

such work are now provided.

The number of work-places, in some cases separate rooms, known

technically as ' tables,' is about fifty-five, and of these about thirty-four

are rented annually by States, Universities, or Associations. Germany

takes about ten of these, and Italy seven. There are thi'ee American

tables, and three English (rented by the Universities of Cambridge and

Oxford and the British Association respectively) ; consequently there are
generally about half a dozen English and American biologists at work in
the station ; but Dr. Dohrn interprets in a most liberal spirit the rules as

to the occupancy of a table, and, as a matter of fact, during my recent

visit there were, for a short time, no less than three of us occupying

simultaneously the British Association ' table,' and provided with separate

rooms.

   A work-table is really a small laboratory fitted up with all that

is necessary for ordinary biological research, and additional apjjaratus and
reagents can be obtained as required. The investigator is supposed to
bring his own microscope and dissecting instruments, but is supplied with

alcohol, acids, stains, and other chemicals, glass dishes, and bottles of

various kinds and sizes, drawing materials, and mounting reagentsi

' JS'ature, February 1891, p. 392.
382 REPORT-- 1000.

Requisition forms are placed beside the worker on which to notify his
wishes in regard to material or reagents, he is visited at frequent inter-
vals by members of the staff, and all wants are supplied in the most perfect
manner.

     The Staff of the station consists of :

--1. Dr. Anton Dohrn, the founder and director.

2. Seven scientific assistants viz. Dr. Eisig, Administrator of the

Laboratories ; Dr. Paul Mayer, Editor of the Publications ; Dr. Gies-

brecht, assistant editor and supervisor of plates ; Dr. Gast, assistant

editor  and  supervisor    of  microscopic drawings ;  Dr.  Schobel, Librarian
                                                                                                                                                    ;

Dr. Lo Bianco, administrator of fisheries and preparateur ; Dr. Hollands,

--temporarily in charge of the microscopic sections department all of them

well-known men, each eminent in his own line of investigation. The

post of assistant in the Physiological Department, formerly held by the

late Dr. Schoenlein, is now A^acant ; and in addition to the foregoing
--there are :
               Secretary,  Mr.  Linden ;  two  painters, and  the  engineer
                                                                                                    ;

with attendants, collectors, and others employed in the laboratories, in

the collecting and preserving departments, Aquarium, and elsewhere.

     This seems at the first thought a very large staff, but the activities of
the institution are most varied and far-reaching, and everything that is

undertaken is carried to a high standard of perfection. Whether it be in

the exposition of living animals to the public in the wonderful tanks of
the ' Acquario,' in the collection and preparation of choice specimens for
Museums, in the supply of laboratory material and mounted microscopic

objects to Universities, in the facilities afforded for research, or in the

educational influence and inspiration which all young workers in the

laboratory feel in each and all of these directions, the Naples station has

a world-wide renown. And the best proof of this reputation for excel-

lence is seen in the long list of biologists from all civilised counti-ies who

year after year obtain material from the station or enrol as workers in the
laboratory. Close on 1,200 naturalists have now, since the opening of the

Zoological Station in 1 873, occupied work-tables, and as these men have come

from and gone back to practically all the important laboratories of Europe
and America, from St. Petersburg to Madrid, and from California to

Japan, Naples may fairly claim to have been for the last quarter-century

a great international meeting-ground of biologists, and to have exercised
a stimulating and co-ordinating influence upon biological research which

it would be difficult to over-estimate.

The opportunities for taking part in collecting expeditions at sea are

most valuable to the young naturalist. Dredging, plankton- collection,
and fishing are cai'ried on daily in the Bay of Naples by means of the two
little steamers belonging to the station, and a flotilla of fishing and other

smaller boats. Many of the Neapolitan fishermen are more or less in the

employ of the station, or bring in such specimens as they find in their

work.

But although the work of the Naples Zoological Station is thus many-

Ansided, the leading idea is certainly original research.     investigator

goes to Naples to make some particular discovery, and he goes thither

because he knows he will find material, facilities, and envii^onment such

as exist nowhere else in the same favourable combination. The British
Association Committee consider it most important that these opportunities

for research should be open to British biologists in the future as they have

been in the past, and it is on this ground that they confidently I'ecom-

mend the policy of sending selected investigators to Naples each year

a practice which has led to such satisfactory results in the past and is full
of promise for the future.

a. The Anatomy of the Flatfishes {Heterosomata). By H. M. Kyle, M.A., B.Sc.

     During the period, from October to the third week in December, 1899,
when I had the privilege of occupying the British Association Table at

Naples, the special research which engaged my attention was the Anatomy

of the Flatfishes {Heterosomata). The species examined there were the

     The main conclusions arrived at have been embodied in a paper
entitled: 'On the Classification of the Flatfishes (Heterosomata),' -which.
is in process of publication in the Scottish Fishery Board's Report for
1899. In this paper it is shown that Citharus linguatula, a species very
common in the Mediterranean, is a transitional form between the Halibut
and Turbot groups of Flatfishes. The characters employed as tests of
relationship are chiefly the position and structure of the ventral or
pelvic fins, the position and structure of the olfactory organs, and the
position of the eyes. Further, although Citharus is the only form in
European waters which marks the transition between these two main
groups, the American fauna possesses many similar forms, and the

classification has therefore been altered in order to include these within

one group or subfamily. It is also shown how the various subfamilies of

the Flatfishes are restricted to fairly well-marked zones of distribution.

    In conclusion, I wish to offer my best thanks to the Committee of the
British Association for the opportunity granted me of pursuing my studies

at Naples, and also to the authorities of the station for their kindness
and courtesy.

h. The Structure of certain Poljjcha-te Worms.
        B)i E. S. GooDEicii, M.A. O.von.

During a short visit to Naples last winter, I occupied the Table of the

British Association at the Zoological station. I have to thank the

Committee for this opportunity of continuing my researches on the

structure of PolychiBte worms.

   My observations were restricted almost entirely to the study of living

Aspecimens of Alciojnds, Pli gllodocidt:, J'olygordms, and Saccocirrn)<.

considerable amount of material was also preserved for future use.

The nephridia of the Alciopids were found to closely resemble those

of the Phyllodocids, having no internal coelomic opening, and being pro-

vided Avith bunches of flagellated cells, the solenocytes. The genital

products are carried to the exterior by ciliated genital funnels, which at

Amaturity open into the nepliridial ducts.  detailed description of these

organs is about to be published in the ' Quart. Journ. of Micr. Science.'

Some details were also added to our knowledge of the nephridia of

Polygordius ; and the structure of the interesting, but little known,
Saccocirrus was carefully investigated. The results of this study, which

is not yet completed, will, I hope, shortly be ready for publication.

  c. Observations on Comjiound Ascidians. By W. A. Heedman, D.Sc., F.R.S.

     I occupied the British Association Table for a little over three weeks
in March and April, 1900, with the object of examining in the living
condition certain Mediterranean Compound Ascidians. Probably the

first thought that occurs to any one who has worked at the Naples

Zoological Station, on recalling the time he spent at that celebrated
laboratory, is one of gratitude to Dr. Dohrn and his excellent assistants
for their pei'sonal kindness and help, and of admiration for their highly
efficient administration. I feel that if other workers desire to express

their gratitude, I esj^ecially should do so, for it is probable that I gave

iinusual trouble at a busy period, and it seemed to me that I was treated

with exceptional kindness. In addition to Dr. Dohrn, I desire to thank

especially Dr. Eisig and Dr. Lo Bianco. With the latter I was brought

largely into contact by the nature of ray work.

    During the recent short myvisit, intention was mainly to see and

examine as many species and specimens of Compound Ascidians as possible

in the living condition, and then have them killed and preserved for
histological work later. I was ^iven excellent facilities for collectinji in
the small steamer Johannes Midler, belonging to the station, and twice

-- --sometimes three times evei-y day fresh supplies of material, brought in

by the fishermen, were placed in my aquaria.

     The Compound Ascidians of the Bay of Naples have not yet been
monographed. Some species were described by Delle Chiaje and others
long ago, when the genera were imperfectly known and anatomical

characters were not recorded. Other species have been briefly diagnosed

tnore recently (but without any figures) by Delia Valle. It is now almost
impossible in many cases to tell from these descriptions alone which of
       THi; ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.                                   385

the Mediterranean species agree with those of the Fi-ench coast described
by H. Milne-Edwards, Giard, and Lahille, and with our British species.

     I wished, therefore, to compare these published, but sometimes in-
sufficient, descriptions with living specimens from the original localities

in order to determine, if possible, the systematic positions of the species

and provide myself with figures and anatomical details for comparison
with British species. Fortunately, also, I found that Dr. Lo Bianco had
in his stores a few of Delia Valle's type specimens, or at least specimens
of these species identified and labelled by Delia Valle himself. These I
was permitted to draw and examine. In regard to the other species, of
which there were no authenticated specimens, I soon found that from the

large number of examples they laid before me I was able in most cases

to determine what form the original describer had before him. I then
made coloured drawings of that form and examined its anatomy to settle
to which modern genus it belonged, and samples of every species I
examined and drew were preserved foi' histological purposes. In this way
I hope I have secured the material necessary for an accurate comparison
of a number of the Mediterranean and British species. I have brought
back over thirty sheets of coloured figures, and Dr. Lo Bianco is sending

a collection of bottles to Liverpool.

at Naples :

Report on the Occupation of a Table at the Zoological Station at Naples

                            during March and April 1900.

d. The Anatomy of Phyllirkoe, the Coilenterate Plcmkton, and certain
  Calenterata. By R. T. Gunthee, M.A., Magdalen College, Oxford.

    The Committee of the British Association permitted me to use the
Table hired by the British Association during the summer months of the

present year, for the prosecution of certain researches on pelagic organisms

in which I have been for some time and am at present engaged. Since
it was inconvenient for me to work at Naples during the months of May

and June, I was, by the generous courtesy of the Director of the Zoological

Station, permitted to commence the occupation of the Table during my

Easter vacation at a time when the resources of the station are very

severely taxed by the great concourse of zoologists who annually assemble

there at that season. For this especial act of kindness, in addition to

so many others I have been shown by Dr. Dohrn, I desire to ofier my

hearty thanks.

  --The Table of the British Association was occupied by me for about a

month between March 24 and April 2-5, 1900.

    My attention was principally devoted to a detailed study of the

anatomy of Phyllirkoe and to a daily examination of the Ccelenterate

portion of the plankton of the bay. The general character of the latter
was very similar to what it was on a former occasion when I had the
good fortune to examine it, but owing to the prevalence of westerly winds
during parts of March and April, an unusual quantity of Velella and

Physalia appeared in the bay. All along the sandy foreshore of Cuma,
which is open to the west, sea and beach were remarkably delimited by
Velella; extending as a blue band about a foot or so broad and many miles

in length. In consequence, too, of the same prevailing winds Physalia,
which is extremely rare at Naples, and which has not been taken for

twelve years, as I am informed by my friend Cav. Lo Bianco, appeared in

great numbers, and was probably drifted in from the Atlantic as a con-

sequence of the exceptional meteorological conditions.

I availed myself of the opportunity of verifying the statement that the

characteristic blue colouring-matter of Velella (zoocyanin) may be very

conveniently extracted from the tissues by maceration in a saturated
Asolution of potassium acetate.
                                              solution prepared on March 26, which

has been kept in the dark, still retains its blue colour, and will be sub-

mitted to spectroscopic examination on my return to England. As the

result of the action of the potassium acetate, the ' yellow cells ' or sym-
biotic algse, which are yellow in the tissues of the Velella, turn green. In

several of the species examined the arrangement of these yellow cells was

in groups of 2, 4, 8, or other multiples of 2.
THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.                                387

    Among other observations upon Codenterata, I have observed the

existence of a continuous longitudinal strip of cells with granular proto-
plasm situated in the ectoderm and extending along one side ol the
tentacles of certain Hydrozoa. I have demonstrated the existence of this
band of cells in the tentacles of the medusaj of Carmarina and in those
of the hydropolyps of Obelia, Uiidendrinm, and Aglaophenia, and I have
no doubt that it can be demonstrated in other genera also. This band

of specialised cells can be made obvious by keeping the living animals for
some time in sea-water tinted by methylene blue in the proportion recom-
mended by Zoja.' It was found that certain cells along one side of the
tentacles became stained, thus demonstrating the existence of the above-
mentioned band of differentiated histological elements.

    I was enabled to make very considerable progress with my work on

the anatomy of Phyllirhoe, and to make several observations on the living

animal, which I hope to publish before the close of the present year.

                              By A. II. Reginald Buller, Ph.D.

     I occupied the table of the British Association from March 15 until

April 21.
     The research work undertaken was an endeavour to determine whether

the eggs of the Echinoidea excrete a fluid which attracts the spermatozoa
chemotactically. Bergh ^ states that attraction by a special substance is
probable. According to Strasburger ^ the eggs of the Fucacece (which are
also fertilised after being set free in sea- water) excrete a substance which
attracts the spermatozoa from a distance equal to about two diameters of
an egg.

     The material consisted of the following animals : Arhacia pustulosa
Gray, Echinus microtuberculatus Blv., and Sphxerecltinus granularis Ag.

    No attraction could be observed during artificial fertilisation experi-

ments. Collections of spermatozoa, however, take place in the outer

gelatinous coat of the eggs. Observations were made tending to show
that this is a physical and not a chemotactic phenomenon.

     Experiments were then made in which it was sought to collect in sea-
water the supposed fluid excreted from the eggs. The eggs were left very

thickly placed together for 2-12 hours in a very shallow layer of sea- water,
and the latter, after filtration, introduced by means of an air-pump into
capillary glass tubes. These were then placed in a drop containing motile

spermatozoa. No gathering of the spermatozoa into the tubes could be

observed. One precaution taken was to prove that just before filtration

the eggs could be fertilised.

     In the case of Arbacia it was discovered that when spermatozoa are

introduced into a drop containing freshly extruded eggs they collect into
small balls, often composed of 100 or more individuals. The balls were

Aalso formed after the water had received four successive filtrations.

tactile stimulus appears to play a part in tlie phenomenon.

     When a sufficient numbei' of spermatozoa have penetrated the gela-

 tinous coat of an egg and have become attached by their heads to the
 layer which is subsequently raised and forms the vitelline membrane,

rotation of the egg takes place. During the rotation, which may be in

 any direction, the gelatinous coat does not also rotate.

     By means of the capillary tube method an attempt was made to find

some substance which attracts the spei^matozoa. Various substances,
known to give a chemical stimulus to other organisms, were tested : meat

 extract, peptone, cane-sugar, glycerine, asparagine, alcohol, oxalic acid,

nitric acid, potassium nitrate, sodium chloride, potassium malate diastase,

and distilled water. No definite chemotactic attraction could be observed

in any case.
      Tlae chief results arrived at were :

      1 The spermatozoa of the Echinoidea are not attracted to the eggs by
means of any special substance excreted by the latter. The vast number
of spermatozoa and the large size of the eggs are sufficient to ensure the

necessary contact taking place.
      2. It is not improbable that the spermatozoa are unable to respond to

chemical stimuli by change in the direction of movement.

    It gives me much pleasure to acknowledge my indebtedness to the
staft' of the Stazione Zoologica for supplying me with material and

apparatus during the research.

                               By Professor R. Ramsay Weight.

    In answer to my request that I might be permitted to avail myself of

the arrangement existing between the British Association Committee and
the Naples Zoological Station, the Secretary of the Committee was good

enough to recommend me to the kind offices of the Director, Dr. A.

Dohrn.
     Although the British Association Table was already occupied, I found

Dr. Dohrn anxious to make special arrangements for my accommodation,

and I accordingly took advantage of these from December 20 till the end

of February.

    My object being to familiarise myself with the methods in use at the

station, as well as with the Naples fauna in a living condition, I was
installed in a room adjacent to that of Dr. Lo Bianco. Thanks to his
intimate and extensive faunistic knowledge and to his untiring willingness
to impart the results of his long experience in the conservation of marine

animals, I felt at the close of my ten weeks' stay more than satisfied with

the results I attained. As Dr. Lo Bianco was engaged at the time in
giving instruction in methods to a medical officer of the German Navy, I

was enabled to share these demonstrations and to acquire some expertness
in dealing with those forms which, like the Siphonophora, had long proved
refractory to attempts at preservation until Dr. Lo Bianco succeeded in
elaborating the methods at present in use.

     I hope to be able in the near future to utilise the technical experience

gained at the New Canadian Marine Laboratory which has recently been

brought to the notice of the British Association.

    While expressing my thanks to your Committee, as well as to

Dr. Dohrn and the various members of the staff of the Zoological Station,

for the many courtesies shown me, I desire to record my opinion of the

high efficiency of the station and of the convenience to British naturalists

incident to the partial support thereof by the British Association.

 Natural History and Ethnography of the Malay Penviisula. Report of

     the Committee, consisting of Mr. C. H. Read (Ghaii-man), Mr. W.
     Crooke (Secretary), Professor A. ]Macalister, and Professor W.

       RiDGEWAY.

The Committee have received the following report from Mr. W. W.

 Skeat, the leader of the expedition :

   Report on Cambridge Exploring Expedition to the Malay Provinces of

                   Lotver Siam. Drawn up by W. W. Skeat.

      This expedition was organised to carry out a scientific survey, in which
 Ethnology, Zoology, Botany, and Geology should all have a share, of the
 little-known Malay provinces of Lower Siam, and especially to extend
 the scope of the ethnographical collections and observations referred to in
 the Fourteenth Annual Report of the Antiquarian Committee to the Senate
 (June 6, 1899).

      The party comprised Messrs. R. Evans, of Jesus College, Oxford ; E. F.
 Laidlaw, of Trinity College, Cambridge ; D. T. Gwynne-Vaughan, of
 Christ's College, Cambridge ; R. H. Yapp, of St. John's College, Cambridge

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

 N. Annandale, of Balliol College, Oxford, and myself.
      The inhabitants of these provinces are, for the most part, Malay, but

 Siamese influence becomes gradually predominant to the northward, and
 the process of fusion between these two antagonistic elements presents
 some curious racial problems. But the most interesting subject for
 investigation in these provinces is perhaps presented by the very primitive

jungle tribes of the interior, about whom much valuable information was

 obtained.

     Yet another interesting tribe, of whom no account seems to have yet
been published, is the sacred tribe of the Prams, who claim to have come

 over from India, and to have established themselves in the country

anterior to the coming of the Siamese or Malays. What truth there may
be in their statements will (it may be hoped) now be ascertainable, as a

 copy of their sacred book, containing an account of their origin, was
 obtained by the expedition.

      But the special interest of the territories traversed centres, perhaps, in

the fact that they have hitherto formed a species of ethnical backwater,
but little, if at all, affected by the ideas of a higher civili.sation. These

ideas, however, are already taking root, and many of the manners and

 customs witnessed by the expedition are becoming obsolescent or are

 already obsolete.

     It is hoped that when the results are known the present expedition

will be found to have achieved results to some extent comparable with
those obtained by the important expedition sent by the Dutch Government
to Mid-Sumatra in 1877-9. The results obtained should also be of value,
for purposes of comparison, with the results of the very successful

Cambridge Anthropological Expedition of Dr. Haddon to the Torres

Straits, Sarawak, and New Guinea.

     Owing to the uncertainty as to the probable reception which the
expedition would experience at the hands of the inhabitants, the good
offices of the Siamese Government were bespoken by the Foreign Office

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and I have much pleasure in recording the extreme hospitality and

enlightened help which the expedition consequently received from the local

authorities, in some cases, perhaps, under rather difficult circumstances.

The warmest thanks of those interested in the expedition are due to

H. E. Phya Sukhum, the High Commissioner for the Ligor Circle of the

Siamese-Malay States ; to Luang Phrom and Kun Rat, the special com-

missioners attached to the expedition as escort ; to the Commissioners and

Rajas of Patalung, Singora, Patani, Raman, Jala, Jering, Nawng Chik,

Ligeh, Teluban, and Kelantan, the Sultan of Kelantan, the Sultan of

Trengganu, and the Sultan and Raja Muda of Kedah.

   We reached Singora on March 27, 1899, and were most hospitably

entertained in his own house by the High Commissioner, H. E. Phya

Sukhum. Next day we proceeded up the Inland Sea. This is a very

shallow lake, or, perhaps, rather chain of lakes, part of which is salt and

part fresh water. It measures, roughly speaking, some sixty miles in

length, and in the broadest part is not less than twenty miles wide. Some

dredging was done here by Messrs. Evans and Annandale, and the Bird's

Nest Islands were visited, observations made, and photographs taken of

the curious cave-dwellings of the island guards.

    At Lampam (Lumpumm) a short stay was made by Messrs. Evans

and ''^aughan, Mr. Annandale and myself proceeding into the interior to

try to meet with a small Sakei (jungle) tribe of Pangans who were

reported to have been seen in the vicinity, and to photograph some of the

Siamese tree-graves, which method of burial, in accordance with instruc-

Ations from Bankok, is fast becoming obsolete.  forced march Ijy

night on elephants brought us to the spot too late to overtake the

wild men, who had moved away, no one could say whither, the night

before our arrival. Mr. Annandale was able, however, to photograph

their late dwelling-place, which consisted of a cave under a projecting

rock, near the summit of a lofty hill. He also took photographs of the

tree-graves. These are usually cigar-shaped wrappers, or rather ' shells '

made of laths, and suspended horizontally at a height of 6 to 8 feet

from the ground between two tree-trunks, branches, or posts. The corpse

is exposed in one of these shells (the heels being generally left higher than

the head), and allowed to decay till the bones are clean, after which the

bones should be collected and burnt. Box-like receptacles on posts

(as among the Madangs of Borneo) are occasionally substituted for the

wrappers. On this journey some strange articles of diet were served up

to us, among them being red ants, toads, bee-grubs, and a species of
cicada. The manner in which the latter are caught is peculiar. Two or

three natives gather at night round a brightly burning wood tire, one of

them holding a lighted torch. The others clap their hands at regular

intervals, and the cicada;, attracted by the noise and guided by the light,

ily down and settle upon the people as they stand by the tire. In the

' wat ' (Siamese temple) at Ban Nah Mr. Annandale noticed that one of the

small tigures of Buddha which had been deposited in the temple as an

offering, contained a fossil shell, and this clue, carefully followed up, led

to the discovery of the quarry from which the fossil had been taken. The

formation is of the Cretaceous age, and a number of specimens showing

fossiliferous traces were secured here , well-authenticated finds of fossils
in the Malay Peninsula have been of the rarest possible occurrence.

    On this same journey a couple of young leopard- or panther-cubs were

picked out of their nest in a hollow tree by the roadside, and it being.
ON NATURAL HISTORY AND ETHNOGRAPHY OF MALAY PENINSLLA. o95

found difficult to feed them they were, on reaching Lampam, suckled by

a Siamese woman, who claimed to have previously suckled a bear. On

reaching Lampam we found that Messrs. Evar.s and Vaughan had pro-

ceeded to the ' Tale Noi,' or ' Little Lake, at the end of the Inland Sea,
Weand followed them accordingly.
                                  did not overtake them, but our visit

to the ' Little Lake ' was of great interest. In one of the local ' wats ' or

temples a human embryo was found among the offerings. We also came

upon a small isolated tribe called ' Pram ' {1 Brahm) people, who claimed to

be a sacred tribe of Indian origin, and appear to have been hitherta

undescribed. They retained several peculiar customs, notably that of

burying their dead in a sitting posture, with the top-knot tied to the top

Aof the coffin.  copy of a sacred book, describing the origin of the tribe

and the story of their migration, was obtained with difficulty. It is said

to be written in an Indian language, which they themselves no longer

understand. Their dress consisted of a white robe, a white shoulder-

cloth, and a peculiar white two-peaked turban or cap. Their chiefs

claimed that they were the oldest inhabitants of the country, and that

they were not constrained to make obeisance even to the sovereign.

After a few days' further stay in Singora, where we rejoined Messrs.

Evans and Vaughan, we proceeded to Patani in the commissioner's yacht,

arriving after a good passage just in time to witness part of the gorgeous

pageantry of a Malay ' royal ' wedding, between the Raja of Patani's

sister and the ' Paja Muda ' of Ivelantan.

At Patani we were lodged in a big brick building ordinarily used as a

Anschool.  unfortunate accident here greatly handicapped the photo-

Agraphic work.   big iron-bound shutter fell from its fastenings with a

crash inside the building, and striking our best camera, so injured it

that it had to be sent to Europe for repairs, a matter of months, and an

irreparable loss so far as photographic work was concerned. It had just

been used for taking a photograph of the Raja of Patani, who had mo«t

fortunately just returned to his house. Mr. Evans also had a narrow

escape.

    On the 28th we left for Bukit Besar, or Negiri (Indragiri), an isolated

mountain about -3,000 feet high, on which several days were spent. This

was known to the natives as a haunted mountain possessing a pond near

the summit, on which are said to grow certain magical shrubs, one of
which is believed to be the means of conferring perennial youth on its
finder, and another to be one of the most powerful love-charms in the
world. These treasures are guarded by a host of demons, and the natives
expressed great fear of them until the ascent to our camp (at a height of
about 2,000 feet) had been successfully accomplished, after which their
fears rapidly subsided. Mr. Evans got his first specimen of Peripatus
here, and Mr. Vaughan also did well with the mountain flora.

     On our return to Patani Messrs. Vaughan, Annandale, and Evans

proceeded up the Patani to Biserat in Jalor (Jala), which proved an
excellent collecting-ground. I stayed at Patani for some days longer;

and visited the very extensive saltpans near the river mouth, the Patani
potteries, and the grave and shi-ine of the celebrated local saint of Cape

Patani, about all of which much information was gained. Of the latter
many miracles are told, and his grave-posts (at the head and foot) are
still believed to make prophetic movements, one instance of which I was
enabled to test on the spot. Two very curious rods, such as are used in

divination, were here obtained.
396 REPORT-- 1900.

On the 26th I rejoined the rest of the party at Biserat, and then

visited the magnificent limestone caves, a very complete collection of

whose fauna was made by Mr. Annandale. These caves included the fine
Gua Gambar, or Statue Cave, which contains a recumbent figure of Buddha,

nearly 100 feet long, as well as a number of other statues in a sitting

posture. Extensive zoological and botanical collections were also made at

Biserat by Messrs. Evans and Vaughan. An exhibition of devil dancing

was here witnessed.

Smallpox having now set in badly and two deaths occurring in the

village, collecting became more difiicult, and presently the Raja and his

household retired to the hills, and many houses were closed by means of a

rattan, carried round outside the fence of the compound, whilst slipknots

of jungle-grass (lalang) were hung across the gate, and a couple of stems

of a bitter-tasting tree, called the Bedara Pahit, buried crosswise on the

threshold.

     One of the annual ceremonies for the purification of a village was
here witnessed, and many ethnological specimens and much information

obtained. On June 6 Mr. Evans fell ill, and as he took long to recover,

Messrs. Annandale and Vaughan proceeded to Kota Bharu, in Raman,

whilst Mr. Evans and I went down to the coast.

After spending a few days at Patani, we went to Jambu in Jering.

Here, too, I witnessed the annual ceremony for the purification of the

village, at which the launching of a spirit-boat, about a yard and a half

long, formed the chief feature. Before leaving Jambu I paid a flying
visit to Teluban. On returning to Patani we were rejoined by Messrs.

Vaughan and Annandale, and proceeded by the overland route through

Raman Ligeh and Ulu Kelantan, and up the Lebih, a tributary of which

stream, the Aring, takes its rise in the neighbourhood of the Tahan

Mountain, which it was one of the objects of the expedition, if practi-

cable, to ascend. The expedition therefore started from Biserat on July 6,
and proceeded to Kota Bharu, the chief town of Raman.

Halts of some days' duration for transport purposes were made at Kota

Bharu, Tremangan, Belirabing, and Aur Gading (a village below the

rapids on the Lebih river), but on August 10 the expedition reached the

village of Kuala Aring, having covered in thirty-five days (only about half

of which were spent in travelling) a distance of about 200 miles. The

first eighty or ninety miles were performed on elephant back, the remainder

by means of boats or bamboo rafts. Mr. Vaughan, who had only joined

the expedition for the first six months, left us at Belimbing.

    At Kuala Aring I found the local authorities so opposed to giving

information about the route to the mountain that it appeared to me safer

to try to find the way for myself than to put the expedition at the

mercy of local guides. I therefore left Messrs. Evans and Annandale at

the village, and set out to scout with two of the Malays belonging to the

expeditionary staff" I decided to attempt the mountain from the Pahang

side, and ascending the Lebih to its headwater crossed the watershed by
way of Bukit Batu Atap, and descending the tributaries of the Tembeling

eventually reached a village called Kampong Pagi, where I spent four or

five days in fruitless attempts to obtain guides from the wild tribes in the

neighbourhood. They were afraid to go, but I obtained the services of

six of the local Malays as carriers (two of whom absconded at the end of

the first day's march), and proceeded up the banks of the Tahan river

Myuntil the foot of the mountain was reached.   original plan was to
ON NATURAL HISTORY AND ETHNOGRAPHY OF MALAY PENINSULA. 397

ascend some of the high crags in the vicinity of the mountain, and thus
ascertain its locality, but at the end of the first week's march, finding that
we were on what appeared to be a spur of the main range, I decided to

Wego forward and ascend it as far as circumstances would permit.

therefore climbed the range peak by peak, but were at length stopped by
a formidable subsidence or break, which forced us to return on our tracks
for a day's march before we could circumvent it. Eventually, after a
march of about eleven days since our entry into the river, we reached the

highest point that we could compass, about 200 feet to 300 feet below the
peak, when we were stopped by an overhanging wall of rock which, after

Weseveral attempts, we found ourselves unable to scale or circumvent.

got sight, however, here of a hitherto unrecorded companion peak to the
Tahan Peak, which was identified as Gunong Larong, or ' Coffin Moun-

tain.' At this time we had barely enough rice even on short rations to
last three days, and the descent, till we reached the nearest human habita-
tion, took five. Our difficulties were further increased by fog, rain, and

fever.

     The rains were exceptionally heavy, the Tahan river being three times
ill flood during our ascent of the mountain, and as they had set in earlier
than usual, it appeared, under the circumstances, unadvisable and unsafe
to commit the rest of the expedition to the ascent of the mountain.

     Mr. Annandale therefore, who had been waiting at Kuala Aring ^vith

a view to participating in the ascent of the mountain, if practicable,

returned to Europe, and Mr. Evans remained in camp with Mr. Yapp, who
had arrived during my absence. Mr. Laidlaw accompanied me up the Aring

river, and there took photographs and full measurements of several persons

belonging to the wild tribes, w^hile a good deal of information about their
manners and customs, as well as a vocabulary of nearly 600 words, was
collected by myself.

     On our return, we all descended the Lebih on rafts, as far as its

juncture with the Kelantan river, and thence descended the latter as far
as Kota Bharu, the capital of the important East Coast State of Kelantan,
and the seat of its Raja.

     On the way down the river we measured and photographed several
more Sakeis. At Kota Bharu Messrs. Laidlaw and I stayed for about a
month, Messrs. Yapp and Evans proceeding to Trengganu, in order to pay

a short visit to the coral islands off that coast.

    Much important ethnological work was done at Kota Bharu. Investi-

gations were conducted into Malay methods of industry, and a devil-
dancing performance was witnessed by jNIi". Laidlaw and myself, at which
the name of the winning bull at a coming bull- fight was correctly pro-
phesied. Full anthropological measurements were taken by Mr. Laidlaw
of ten or twelve Kelantan Malays, notes made of the colour of their skin,
eyes, hair, (fee, and experiments made as to their colour vision.

    On leaving Kota Bharu we proceeded to Trengganu, where we met
Messrs. Evans and Yapp, who reported having had a narrow escape from

drowning off the Redangs through the swamping of their boat. Mr.

Evans was unable to swim, but I am thankful to say that both he and
Mr. Yapp succeeded in holding on to the boat until they were picked up
by some Malays, who went to their assistance. They were about half a

mile from shore at the time.

    At Trengganu ray investigation of Malay industries was continued,,
and much useful information obtained. The most interesting was perhaps
398 REPORT-- 1900.

--the method of manufacturing damasked krisses the details of which were

carefully studied. Measurements were also taken of at least ten of the
Trengganu Malays, and full observations recorded.

     On leaving Trengganu, we proceeded to Singapore, where a few days

were spent, and a visit paid to one of the villages of the ' Orang Laut ' (the
old piratical stock of sea- gipsies, who were once the terror of the Straits,
and who were found by Sir Stamford Raffles living in their boats round
about the island of Singapore, when it was proclaimed a British Colony).

     By the first available steamer we proceeded to Penang, whence Mr.
Evans proceeded to Pulau Bidan, an island off the Kedah coast, to collect
marine zoological specimens, and Messrs. Yapp and Laidlaw made the
ascent of Gunong Inas (a hill, upwards of 5,800 feet high), in Perak, a

difficult trip, the successful accomplishment of which reflects credit on

Mr. Yapp, who, as the senior member of the staff after Mr. Evans's

departure, took charge of the remainder of the pai*ty in my absence.

They both brought back with them extensive collections (zoological and
botanical). Mr. Evans returned to Penang on Christmas Eve, having
used up the remainder of his outfit, and returned to Europe a few days
later, having completed his year's work.

     As soon as I was able to go up country, I proceeded to Kedah,

and there, after a short excursion up the coast to Satal and Perils,
made two expeditions into the Sakei country, near the headwaters of
the Muda. Here I had the good fortune to find a tribe of from
twenty to thirty individuals living in a long barrack-like shelter of palm-

leaves. From them, and from a neighbouring tribe, I obtained much

valuable information as to their mannei'S, customs, and language, as well
as full measurements of a few individuals, and some probably unique
phonographic records of their songs, which are of an extremely simple
 .nd primitive character. I also, with difficulty, procured the skeleton of
an adult male. In all the States visited by me, investigations were made

into the leading Malay industries, and much valuable material bearing on
this subject was collected. Wherever possible, statistics were obtained
showing the extent and nature of the development of trade and the stage
of civilisation which had been I'eached by the people. Many of the leading
Malay industries, such as that of weaving, are being rapidly modified
by the introduction of European methods and appliances, and it is now
the rarest and most difficult thing to obtain cloth actually made of home-
spun thread, the use of Singapore silk and aniline dyes being already

almost everywhere the fashion.
     In addition to the above, the departments of ethnology studied

included religious and medical ceremonies, children's games, legends,
languages and dialects, under each of which headings a mass of material
was collected.

In accordance with the intention announced in the last report, Mr.

R. C. L. Perkins has again been sent to the islands by the Committee.

His departure from this country was delayed for some months by the out-

bieak of                             plague at  Honolulu                                          but  this                                                                              difficulty having disappeared, he

     Mr. Perkins finds that great changes have taken place in the islands
during his absence, and that the forests are being extensively destroyed

remunerative there.

The Committee ask for reappointment.

pied the table for six weeks, and Mr. Aders for three weeks, during the

past summer. Mr. Darbishiie's report to the Committee is given below.

    An application for the use of the table during the month of September

has been received from Mr. R. C. Punnett, B.A., in order that he may

continue some investigations on which he is at present engaged on the

pelvic plexus of elasmobranch fishes.

                                                Mr. Darbishire's Report.

My original intention was to study the life-history and habits of the
crab Pinnotheres, which is a well-known inhabitant of mantle-cavities of

certain lamellibranchiate                       molluscs                                               but during my visit to                                                                                                                                                                                                        Plymouth
                                                                                         ;

no breeding females could be found, and my observations were limited to
the determination of some new points in the habits and structure of the
Amale of Pinnotheres pisurn.
                                                                                                  specimen of this was dredged in company
with some Cardium norvegicum, from which it presumably came. The
habits of the male were very interesting to observe in view of the seden-
tary habits of the female. It could swim forwards for a long time and at
a good speed, and with an accurate sense of direction. It swam in a
manner hitherto undescribed in crabs by rowing with its last two pairs of
thoracic legs, each of which has a double row of hairs on its posterior
 400 REPOKT-- 1900.

 edge. As the female is said to be blind I made many experiments to>

 determine the sensitiveness of the male to light. It was conclusively
 shown that the male is not only not blind, but is extremely sensitive ta
 light in that it avoids extremes both of light and darkness, and in an
 area offering various degrees of illumination invariably takes up a
 moderately illuminated position.

      As more specimens of Pinnotheres could not be found, I decided to

 study the myology of Calanus. It would be out of place to give here the
 details of the musculature of this copepod, but it is intei-esting to note
 that the arrangement and comparative size of the muscles tend to support
 Prof. MacBride's recent statements as to the movements of C'alanns and
 other copepods, viz. , by means of their second antennae and pleopods, and
 not by means of their first antennae. I tried nuuverous methods for demon-
 strating the muscles by using various stains, fixing agents, and mounting
 media. The most successful was to cut the animal in half sagittally, after
 fixation with corrosive sublimate, stain in borax carmine, and mount in
 glycerine jelly (Brady's solution). This shows the muscles of the trunk

 clearly.

       I take this opportunity of thanking the British Association for the
 use of their table at the Plymouth Laboratory, and Mr. Garstang and Dr.
 Allen for their ever-ready help and suggestions.

--Coral Reefs of the Indian Regions. Interim, Repm't of the Committee,

     consisting of Mr. A. Sedgwick (Chairman), Mr. J. Graham Kerr,

     Professor J. W. Judd, Mr. J. J. Lister, and Mr. S. F. Harmer,

      appointed to investigate the Structure, Formation, and Ch'oivth of

       the Coral Reefs of the Ind/ian Region.

The Committee have received the following report from Mr. J. Stanley

Gardiner :

    The expedition under my charge has been carrying out work during

the last eighteen months in the Laccadives, Maldives, and Ceylon.

     During the month of May 1899 I toured through the raised coral-

reef ai'eas of Ceylon and round the coast. In the north of the island

these form a succession of higher and higher raised reefs down to Dam-

bula, broken only by isolated flat-topped peaks of older rocks, on the sides
of which the successive elevations are sometimes clearly visible in hori-
zontal lines of wave action. It is only in the topography of the older,
often much dolomitised country that the previous existence of either
barrier or isolated reefs is indicated. The greater part is formed of a
mixed reef sand, and appears before elevation to have borne a consider-
able resemblance to the large mudflats round the islands of Viti Levu
and Vanua Levu, in the Fiji group.

     Round the coast of Ceylon, especially to the south, a recent elevation
of five to twenty feet was found in broad flats by the sea. These are
now invariably being washed away down to the low- tide level, at which

they persist, to a certain extent, as fringing reefs of varying breadth.

The greater part of the west and south coasts is devoid, however, of any
reef-growths, the shore being rocky or formed of fine siliceous sand. In

May 1899 the rocky shore near Bentota was seen to be covered with
       ON CORAL llEEFS OF THE INDIAN REGIONS.                         401

small coral colonies, which were evidently a growth of the previous

north-east naonsoon. In September these had completely disappeared,

having been washed away in the south-west monsoon. At Galle, Talpe,

and Weligama numerous recently living colonies of corals, particularly

of the genera Porites and Pocillopora, of four to eight months' growth,

were found completely silted up with sand and dirt of all sorts.

   A noticeable point about the reefs immediately round Ceylon is the

comparative absence of reef-building nuUipores, which are a marked

feature of all isolated oceanic reefs. In connection with this an attempt

was made to examine the shoals two to six miles off the south and south-

west coasts of the island, which indicate with the soundings the possible

upgrowth of a barrier reef. The weather, however, at that season was

so unfavourable that I was unable to dredge, land, or anchor on any.

>Subsequent visits to south India and north Ceylon indicated clearly a

former land connection between the two. The so-called Adam's Bridge

and the islands of Manaar and Ramasserim, which the former joins,

appeared indubitably to be the remains of a formerly elevated limestone

Hat, which has been more or less cut down by the sea to the low-tide

level. The coast lines, too, of Ramasserim and to the north of the Jaffna

peninsula were also probably at one time continuous.

The months of June, July, and August 1899 were spent in Minikoi,

an isolated atoll, the most southern of the Laccadive group. Here I

was accompanied by Mr. L. A. Borrodaile, who proposed to study various

points connected with the Crustacea and Chsetopoda. Unfortunately Mr.

Borrodaile, who had been collecting these forms in Ceylon, almost at

once succumbed to the climate, and after five weeks returned to Ceylon,

whence he was at once ordered home. Every part of the island was

visited : a survey was made and numerous cross-sections were run.

From these it was clear that there had been an elevation of the original

reefs to a height of at least twenty-five feet above low-tide level.

Numerous observations were made on the currents at different depths

within the lagoon in reference to its shoals, &,c. Work on this point

could seldom be carried on outside the reefs, as originally intended,

owing to the heavy north-westerly winds which prevailed. The lagoon

was dredged to ascertain the distribution of its corals, and a few water

samples and temperature observations were taken.

Considerable attention was paid at Minikoi to the sand-feeding organ-

isms, especially Holothuria?, Enteropneusta, and Sipunculida. These forms

appear to be largely instrumental in finely triturating the sand, the small

particles being subsequently carried out of the lagoon in a state of suspen-

sion. The boring organisms, too, are very important in causing the decay

of dead coral and rock, especially in the lagoon. These, accordingly,

do not form points of attachment for fresh reef growths to arise, and

owing to the larger surface exposed are the more readily dissolved by the

water. Indeed all evidence collected showed that the lagoons of atolls
may be, and are, very generally formed by the solution of the central

rock of originally more or less flat reefs.

In October 1899 I left for the Maldive group, to which I was accom-

panied by Mr. Forster Coopei", who assisted me in all the work and very

largely took charge of the dredging. The Sultan lent us a schooner of
about eighteen tons, which we at once fitted out in Male, subsequently

cruising through the northern atolls during the months of November,
December, and part of January. About a hundred islands in the atolls

of Goifurfehendu (Horsburgh), S. Mahlos, N. Mahlos, N. Miladunmiadulu,
S. Miladummadulu, Fadiffolu, and Male were visited. Xumerous sound-

ings were made and dredgings everywhere taken. Horsburgh Atoll and
the two atolls of Mahlos Madulu in particular were thoroughly worked

over.

Parts of January and February 1900 were spent at Hulule, a small

Aisland at the south-east corner of Male Atoll, this being the month of
Ramazan.  thorough survey of this island and its reefs was made, the

whole fuiming an atoll of the second order, an atollon on the rim of an

atoll. Large collections were obtained of the fauna of this atollon from all

Adepths, together with observations on many special points.          set of
corals of known period of growth was collected from an artificial passage

through the reef to the landing-place of the island.

In February Mr. Forster Cooper took the schooner off for a short

dredging cruise in Male Atoll, while I remained in Male making special

observations on the water temperature, currents, food, etc.
     In March I was unfortunately obliged, owing to illness, to return to

Ceylon, where I spent some time in hospital. Mr. Forster Cooper mean-

time continued the work, taking the schooner and dredging the atolls of

S. Male, Felidu, Mulaku, Kolumadulu, and Haddumati.

      In April I returned with the s.s. Ileafaee, a vessel of about 350 tons,
which I had chartered. Mr. Forster Cooper was relieved in Haddumati

WeAtoll and joined the steamer, the schooner ]>eing sent back to Male.

then pi'oceeded to Huvadu (Suvadiva) Atoll, which we entered by a

northern passage. The lagoon to the east was dredged and sounded, the

Apositions of islands and reefs observed, and four islands visited.  move

was then made to Addu Atoll, the outer slopes of which and also the

lagoon were dredged and sounded. The islands were charted in with the

assistance of Captain Molony, and the majority were visited by some

member of the party. On returning to Suvadiva the south and west sides

of that atoll were dredged. On account of the heavy weather we were

prevented from seeing Mulaku, which we had especially desired to visit,

Proceeding north to Male we skirted Haddumati Atoll and crossed

Kolumadulu, then visited and dredged S. and N. Nilandu Atolls, sub-

sequently anchoring in Felidu and Ari. The passages were sounded

between the following atolls : Kolumadulu and S. Nilandu, S. and N.

Nilandu, Mulaku and Wattaru, Wattaru and Felidu, N. Nilandu and

Ari, S. and N. Male. Three further lines of soundings were run across

the central basin between the east and west lines of atolls.

More than three hundred dredgings were taken, and in addition large

and,_we believe, very complete collections were made of the reef-fauna at

Minikoi and Hulule, four natives at least always accompanying and

assisting us in this work. The collections of land-fauna we believe to

be equally complete from these islands. Collections of the plants of

five separate Maldivan islands are now in the hands of Mr. J. C. Willis,

Peradeniya Gardens, Ceylon.

   A large number of anthropological measurements and considerable

ethnological collections were procured, of which we hope to give the Asso-

ciation an account at some subsequent meeting.
ON BIRD MIGRATION.                                   403

--Bird Migration in Great Britain and Ireland. Third Interim Report

    of the Committee, consisting of Professor Newton (^Gliairman),
     Rev. E. P. Knubley (Secretary), Mr. John A. Harvie-Brown,

     Mr. R. M. Barrington, Dr. H. 0. Forbes, and Mr. A. H. Evans,

     appointed to worh oid the details of the Observations of Migration
     of Birds at Lighthouses and lAghtships, 1880-87.

Referring to its Interim Report of last year your Committee has the

satisfaction of stating that Mr. William Eagle Clarke, of the Museum of

Science and Art in Edinburgh, has been diligently continuing the

hiborious task he undertook of working out the details of the collected

observations in accordance with the scheme indicated in the Report made

at Bristol in 1898, and has fui-nished your Committee with the following

Statement, together with a Summary of the observations as regards
(I.) the Song-Thrush {Tiirdus musicits) and (II.) the White Wagtail

{Motacilla alba), which throws such a light on the Natural History and

especially the movements of those two species as has never been possessed

before.

    Your Committee feels that a great debt of gratitude is due to Mr.
Clarke for the courage and perseverance which he has shown in grappling

with the enormous mass of statistics necessary to afford the results so

lucidly and concisely summed up by him. Your Committee trusts that
its feeling may be shared by the Association generally, and that as a
consequence a grant of money may be renewed, if only to defray the

outlay which is involved by the prosecution of Mr. Clarke's labours.
Remuneration for his invaluable .services, which the Association will
remark he is willing to continue, is unfortunately not to be thought of.

     In its Report last year your Committee mentioned that one of its
members (Mr. R. M. Barrington) was printing the results obtained from
the Irish Lights, continued on his own account since 1887. That gentle-

man has since prepared for publication, at the cost of a stupendous amount

of labour, an Analysis of these results, which he hopes will appear before

the end of the year, and your Committee desires to call early attention to

what cannot fail to be one of the most important contributions to the

study of Bird Migration ever made.  ^

Your Committee respectfully requests reappointment.

                            Statement fxcrnished to the Committee.

                              By Wm. Eagle Clarke.

     The extraction of the records of occurrc noes of birds in Great Britain
and Ireland, culled from the voluminous periodical and other literature
published during the period covered by the inquiry, 1880-1887 inclusive,

has at length been completed, and has resulted in many thousands of

useful and important observations relating to the movements and occur-
rences of birds in both maritime and inland localities being added to the
data amassed by the Committee.

      This additional information includes not only a set of valuable records

for the inland counties of Great Britain and Ireland, which was a great
desideratum, but also comprises data relating to the occurrence of a con-

                                                                                                                  Du2

--siderable number of rare and critical species made by ornithologists data,

in fact, that it was impossible to obtain from the light-keepers, whose
knowledge of birds is, naturally, limited.

     Since the year 1891 Mr. Harvie-Brown and myself, with the valued

assistance of Mr. Lionel W. Hinxman and Mr. T. G. Laidlaw, have

prosecuted an inquiry into the movements of birds in Scotland, and the
investigations are still proceeding.^ In addition to the observers at the
liwht-stations, we have enlisted the services of a number of ornithologists.
This again has resulted in the acquisition of much useful supplemen-

tary information.

    Now that the data have been made as complete as possible, the time

has arrived when, for the first time in the annals of British Ornithology,
it is possible to write an authoritative history of the migrations of each

British bird, for few indeed among our native species are entirely

sedentary.

     This is the task I now propose, with the approval of the Committee

and of the British Association, to undertake.

     I submit herewith a Summary of Details of the various migratory

--movements of two species (I.) the Song-Thrush (Turdus musicus) and

--(II.) the White Wagtail {Motacilla alba) as examples of my method of

treatment.

                                        Sum/mary of Details.

                                      I. Song-Thriish (Turdus musicus).

   --Introductory. The Song-Thrush furnishes us with a most excellent

example of the complex nature of the phenomena of bird migration as
observed in Great Britain and Ireland.

      The various movements of this species cover a period of nearly ten
months of the year, June indeed being the only month in which the Thrush
does not figure as a migrant in the records amassed by the Committee.

      During this period it plays a varied role as a migratoiy bird, being a
 summer visitant, a bii'd of passage in spring and autumn, a winter
 visitant, a winter emigrant, and lastly, it is chiefiy to be regarded as a
 rare casual visitor to the most northerly of the British Isles, namely, the

 Shetlands.

      In addition, the Thrush is a permanent resident in certain districts,
 more especially in the gardens and immediate neighbourhood of cities and
towns, where even in Scotland a number remain througliout the year.
Such residents, however, probably form the minority of our British

Thrushes.

    --AuUhmn Emigration of Suinmer Visitors. At the end of summer- and

 in the early autumn a considerable number of the Thrushes which have
 reared their broods with us, especially those which inhabit the elevated

 districts, emigrate towards the south.^

      ' The Keports appeared in the Annals of Scottish Natural History for 1893,
 pp 147-164; 1894, pp. 146-153; 1895, pp. 207-220; 1896, pp. 137-148; 1897,
 pp. 137-151 ; 1898, pp. 200-217; 1899, pp. 140-158; 1900, pp. 70-87.

      - On July 8, 1882, five Thrushes struck the lantern at Slyne Head Lighthouse

 (west coast of Ireland), one of which was killed. In 1885, on July 3 and 11, several

 Thrushes are recorded at the Inner Fame. On all these occasions the weather was

 very unsettled, and thunder prevailed.
     3 Mr. T. G. Laidlaw, whose home in Peeblesshire lies 900 feet above the sea,

 informs me that the Thrushes leave that district ' to a bird ' in the autumn, and

 return during the early months of the year.
ON BIRD MIGRATION.  405

     Some of these may not proceed at once beyond our southern counties,

where the length of their sojourn is determined by the climatic con-

ditions of the season ; others depart forthwith for more southern regions
beyond our limits.

      Throughout August, but chiefly towards the end of the month, there

are clear indications at the light-stations that Thrushes are quietly

slipping away from Britain. There are no marked movements recorded
for this month, but there is unmistakable evidence that a gradual and
steady emigration is in progress on all the coasts of Britain. From the

Irish coasts, however, this happens only rarely during August, the birds

usually departing later in the season. These earliest emigrants are gene- <
rally observed in small numbers, and either alone or occasionally in
company with ' "Warblers ; ' sometimes a few are killed at the lanterns.

     In September and October the emigratory movements are more
general and more pronounced in their nature ; but it is not until the
weather breaks up in the latter month that any ' rush ' is recorded.

mDuring these months, especially in September, the Thrush departs

company with various species of summer birds, and its emigrations are
recorded from all sections of the British and the east and southern coasts
of Ireland. The Thrush is, however, emigratory to a lesser degree in the

Sister Isle than in Britain.

     In. October the migratory movements of the Thrush are often of a very
complex nature, and are diflicult to interpret. The most complicated
movements are those during which emigration, immigration, and passage
are in progress simultaneously, a phenomenon which sometimes happens
under peculiar weather conditions.^

     Later in the year the emigratory movements, which doubtless include

many of the recently arrived immigrants from the north of Europe, are

dependent on and synchronous with more or less severe weather con-
ditions, and these will be duly treated of in the proper place.

   --A^itumn Immigration and Passage. There is no evidence whatever of

the appearance of the Thrush upon our shores, as an immigrant from
North-western Europe, until the end of the third or the beginning of the
fourth week of September, when it arrives with great regularity "* in
company with the first Redwings {Turchcs iliacus) ; occasionally Red-
breasts {Erithacus ruhecula), Goldcrests (Eegulus cristatus), Woodcock
(Scolo2)ax rusticula), Jack Snipe {Gallinago gallinula), and Short-eared
Owls (^Asio accipitrinus) are observed at the same time.^

     The immigrations continue during October, during which month there
are lulls, followed usually by two very pronounced ' rushes ' to our shores,
when for several successive nights Thrushes pour in upon our eastern sea-

board in vast numbers. These ' rushes ' occur as a rule (1) about the
middle of the month, and (2) again during its fourth week.

     These immigratory movements are confined to the east coast of
Britain, from the Orkneys to Norfolk. North Ronaldshay, the most

     ' As early as August I, 1884, six Thrushes struck the lantern of Dhuheartach
Rock Lighthouse, two being killed.

     * Professor Collett, Oversigt af Christiania Omegns ornithologislie Fauna, p. 27,
says that the Thrush departs from the Christiania district during September, and
continues to do so until the first days of November. Statistics for S.W. Norway
would be preferable, as being more intimately associated with those for Great Britain,
but unfortunately they do not appear to be available.

            ,

north-easterly of the Orkneys, and the extreme southern portion of the

main island of Shetland are annually visited, but these stations mark the

northern limit of the Thrush's regular distribution during migration in

Britain, for the bird is recorded very rarely further north, and is practi-

cally unknown in Unst. The Thrush's travelling companions are chiefly

its congeners the Redwing {Turdus iliacus), Fieldfare {T. pilaris), Ring

Ousel  {T.  torquatus),  and Blackbird (?'.  merula)                                  and also the Brambling
                                                                                   ;

(Fringilla montifringilla), Goldcrest {Begulus cristatus), Redbreast

{UrifJiacus riibecula), Woodcock {Scolojyax rusticula), &c.^

     Along with these species many Thrushes perish at the lanterns of the

lighthouses and light- vessels, especially when the night is hazy, with light

rain.

     Unlike its congeners just named, it is somewhat remarkable that the
Thrush does not occur as an immigrant in numbers in November. The

immigi'ation of the Thrush practically ceases with the great arrivals which

characterise the latter half of October, though stragglers do arrive up to

the middle of November. After this the autumn immigration of the

Thrush entirely ceases. Many of the immigrants upon arrival proceed

south, as birds of passage, along our eastern and southern coasts, and

finally quit our shores, the majority to seek more southern lands, others

to cut across St. George's Channel to winter in Ireland. Others, again,

remain as winter visitors, and work their way to Western Britain - and
Ireland after an overland passage. Many of the birds, however, quit our

islands, after a longer or shorter sojourn, under the pressiire of severe

--weather conditions.''
      Winter Movements. The great emigratory movements of the winter

commence in October,'' and are continued during November, December,

January, and February.-'' They are synchronous with outbursts of cold,

snow, or of extremely unsettled weather. Such untoward conditions

may    prevail  generally  over  our  islands, or  they may                           be  circumscribed
                                                                                                                                                   ;

ancl their influence on the emigrations of the Thi'ush is in more or less

direct consonance with their distribution.
     In genial months little or nothing is recorded. In others the few

local movements are traceable to topical weather conditions. But sooner

or later during each season great outpourings take place, often extending

over several successive days and nights and affecting all our coasts. The

Thrushes aflfected are not merely our would-be resident birds, but a very

     ' For the weather conditions controlling the movements of the British autumn

immigrants, see the ' Digest of Observations,' Brit. Assoc. Jtep., 1896, pp. 469-471.

     - The Thrush is a -winter visitor only to certain isles off our western coasts, among
others Tiree in the Inner Hebrides. From careful observations made on that island
by Mr. Peter Anderson, we learn that this bird makes its first appearance there for
the winter on dates varying from October 4 to 30, some considerable time after its

first arrival on our shores.
     ' It has been stated that a small dark race of the Thrush occurs on passage on

the east coast of England. These birds are supposed to be of Hebridean origin.
I. have never seen specimens of such a race, and I do not believe that they can have

found their way to our eastern coast from the Hebrides. I have examined a number
of Thrushes from Barra in the Outer Hebrides, where the bird is a resident, and do
not find them to differ either in size or colour from the ordinary mainland form.

     · In 1886, as early as October 4 and 6, there were great emigratory movements on
all our coasts, due to extremely unsettled weather, with thunder in the N. and N.W.,
accompanied on the 5th by a great fall of temperature--a fall of fifteen degrees below

that of the previous daj"-.

     ^ There are also movements during March in some years ; but they are of a local

nature, and are not to be regarded as emigratory.
ox BIRD MIGRATION.  407

large proportion of them are no doubt the immigrants lately arrived from
the north, which, as winter visitors to our islands, remain until compelled
to move further south or west.

     The first move on these occasions is to the coast, where some tarry,
and even remain to perish ; while others pass down both the east and
west coasts of Great Britain, many of those following the former route,

sweeping along the south coast westward, and crossing the Channel for

the Continent. Many again seek Ireland, from which, however, emigra-

tions are also recorded.

     Should the cold spell be of great severity, or be unduly prolonged and
widespread, then a still further exodus takes place (observed chiefly on

the west coast of Great Britain and east coast of Ireland), and many

perish even in such usually safe retreats as the Scilly Isles, and at

Valentia, or other isles off the west coast of Ireland, which are largely

sought on such occasions. No doubt, too, many of these emigrants perish

in their continental haunts, for after winters of almost arctic severity,

such as that of 1880-81, ^ the Thrush was conspicuous by its absence, or by
its rarity, in most districts in our islands.

  --Spring Immigration. Among the voluminous records relating to the

movements of this species during February, there are many which clearly
indicate that the Thrushes which left us in the early autumn to winter in
countries to the south of us commence their return to our islands for the

spring and summer.

     These immigrations are performed by small parties during mild periods
of the month, and are chiefly observed on the southern coasts of England
and Ireland.

     Such return movements are continued during the first half of March,
when immigrant Thrushes, in company with Blackbirds [Turdus merula).
Larks {Alauda arvensis), Pipits [Antkus pratensis), Starlings (Sturnus vul-
garis), Lapwings Vanelhis vulgaris), and Curlews {Niimenius arqitata), are

                                                    (

recorded from the south coast of England northwards to the Western
Isles of Scotland, and from the south and south-east coast of Ireland.

     The arrivals on the south coast of England take place during the night

or early morning. In Ireland they are recorded for both the hours of
darkness and during the daytime, and the birds are noted as proceeding

in a north-westerly direction at the south-east stations.

     In most instances the return is a gradual one, performed by small
companies, and at intervals, but occasionally in March in ' rushes ' with

the other species already mentioned.

   --Spring Emigration. Towards the end of March the Thrushes which

have wintered in Tiree and other western islands off the coasts of Scot-
land and in Ireland ai'e recorded as taking their departure.

     It is not, however, until April that the spring emigratory movements
from the mainland of Britain set in. Then the birds which have
wintered in our islands leave our shores to return to their summer
haunts in Northern Europe.'^

      Throughout April, but chiefly during the first three weeks of the

     ' During this winter twenty days of hard frost and sixteen days of deep snow
prevailed on the west coast of Ireland. It was much more severe elsewhere.

      - Other severe seasons covered by the inquiry, during which great move-
ments and much mortality among our Thrushes are recorded, are those of 1885-6 and

1887. The first half of March, 1886, was remarkably severe, and many Thrushes

 perished even in our southern counties.

      ^ In 1885, on March 28 and 29, a few Thrushes in company with Blackbirds ap-
 peared at North Ronaldshay, the most north-easterly island of the Orkneys.
408 REPORT-- 1900.

month, the emigratory movements of the Thrush are pronounced, and are
almost entirely confined to the northeast coast of England and to the
eastern and northern stations of Scotland . Some movements are also in
evidence on the west coast of Britain, where the birds departing from
Ireland and the Hebridean Islands are observed.'

    On these occasions the Thrush is noted as emigrating in company with

Blackbirds {Tiirdus mertiJa), Fieldfares (T. pilaris), Redwings {T. iliaciis),
and Redbreasts {Erithacus rubecula).

     During April the British emigratory movements doubtless become
merged with those of the Thrushes which are on passage along our coast-
line, proceeding from their more southern winter to their more northern
summer quarters.

  --Spring Birds of Passage. The first undoubted appearance of the Thrush

as a bird of passage takes place at the end of March, when the birds which
have wintered in South-western Europe, and are en route for breeding
quarters to the north of our isles, arrive on the south coast of England in
company with Blackbirds (Trtrc??iS7wer?/.?a), Fieldfares (T.pi^aHs), Redwings
{T. iliaciis), Wheatears (Saxicola oenanthe), ' Warblers ' (Sylviidce), Larks
{Alauda a^-vensis), Starlings (Siurnus vulgaris), and, occasionally. Wood-

cocks (Scolopax riisticula).

     These early arrivals do not appear to proceed to North- Western Europe

instanter,- for, as we have stated, there are no March emigrations. The
passage continues throughout April, when the voyageurs pass northwards
along our eastern seaboard, where they are joined by many of our British

emigrants of the same species ; and it is often a matter of difficulty to
distinguish between these classes of migrants during certain movements

in April.

     In the years 1881, 1883, and 1885 there were a few movements which
carry the date of passage into May, the 10th of that month being the
latest date on which the northern migration of the Thrush is recorded.*^

     Such is the history of the Song- Thrush as a British migratory bird,
when the tangled skein of its various movements has been reduced to order
through careful study.

     The main facts elicited are :

     1. That many Thrushes leave us at the end of summer and during the
autumn, indicating that a very considerable number are summer visitors

to our islands

           --;

     2. That the first immigrant Thrushes winter visitors and birds of

--passage appear on our shores from the N.E. during the latter days of

September

in spring in the Christiania district.

^ From March 19 to 26, 1898, the Rev. O. Pickard-Cambridge, F.E.S., records an

increasing number of Thrushes around his rectory at Wareham, on the coast of Dorset.

On the 25th the land was fairly covered with them, and there must have been 200 or

more in one field. On the 26th there were even more. On the 27th there were fewer,

and by the evening of the 28th all had departed. Xool., 1898, p. 264.

                                    II. White Wagtail (Motacilla alba).

     The White Wagtail as a British migrant presents several points of

interest.

     As a summer visitor it is somewhat rare, and has only been recorded

to breed occasionally in some of the more southerly counties of England.
     It is chiefly as a bird of passage that it visits our islands, and is then

en route to and from northern breeding haunts which lie both to the N.E.
and N.AV. of us, namely, in Scandinavia, Faroe, and Iceland. It occasion-
ally reaches Southern Greenland.

     As a migrant it is one of those species, few in number, which are more

abundantly and generally observed on our western seaboard and its
vicinity than on the east coast.

   --Spring Immigration. The White Wagtail arrives on the south coast of

England in small parties during March, sometimes during the early days
of that month. ^

     ' The earliest date with which 1 am acquainted relates to this bird's occurrence

near Plymouth on March 3, 1872.
410 REPORT-- 1900.

     The immigrants continue to arrive on the English shores of the
Channel until late in April, and in certain seasons have been observed in
numbers on the west coast of Cornwall as late as the first half of May.

     On arrival on our southern seaboard the birds, which are most

abundant on the westerii section of that coastline, usually tarry for some
little time before resuming their journeys. In due course, however, they
pass inland or northwards along both the east and west coasts, especially

--the latter.
     Spring Passage. During March there are few records of the White
Wagtail's appearance on either the east or west coast of Great Britain.
With April, however, the regular passage northwards sets in, and continues

--until about the middle of May ' not beyond, so far as regular passage is

concerned.

     On the west coast we are able to trace the birds from Cornwall along

the Welsh coast to the Solway and Clyde areas, and occasionally north-
wards to West Ross. ' AYagtails ' are, however, observed regularly on

passage at Cape Wrath, the N.W. limit of the mainland of Scotland,
down to the middle of May. I have little doubt that these recoi'ds
relate to this species. Passing thence to the western islands, we pick up

the lines of flight first at the important rock station of Skerryvore, and
then at the Hebrides, in whose outer and inner islands, or certain of them,
it is a bird of double passage. Here it has been observed at Barra,

Monach, Lewis, Tiree, and Coll. At Barra (a southern island of the outer
group) and at Tiree (one of the inner isles) it is quite common on passage
in both spring and autumn ; and from these stations we have during late

years been furnished with a valuable set of observations, and have

examined many Hebridean specimens obtained on both islands at each of

 the seasons.

     At the Monach Isle, with the exception of St. Kilda, the most western
of the Hebrides, the White Wagtail is recorded as occurring not unfre-

quently during April and early May.
      Intimately connected, no doubt, with these far western British move-

 ments are those observed in Ireland. Here, however, our present know-
ledge is only of a fragmentary nature, for the few observations made in
 the sister isle all relate to the coast and isles of a single county, namely.
 Mayo, where the White Wagtail has been occasionally seen on passage
 during April and early May.'*

      It is stranife that there is not a sinsle instance on record of the White
 Wagtail's occurrence on the east coast of Ireland, though I can scarcely
 bring myself to believe that the bird does not occur there on its migratory

 journeys.

      Passing to the east coast of Great Britain, we find little or no infor-

 mation for its southern section, not even for that county which has
 always been remarkable for ornithological research and for its able
 ornithologists, namely, Norfolk. Here it appears to have occurred merely
 on two or three occasions, and in the springtime only.

       ' At the island of Tiree, Inner Hebrides, it has been observed passing north in

 considerable numbers as late as May 15.

       " The following are the spring records for Tiree kindly furnished to Mr. Harvie-

 Brown and myself" by Mr. Peter Anderson: 1893, April 7 and May 1 ; 1894, April 7,
 12, and 30 ; 1895, May 8 and 5 ; 1896, April 23 and 24 ; 1897, April 28 and 30 and
 May 1 and 4 to 8 ; 1898, April 19 and 26 ; 1899, May 3 and 15 (many).

       ^ The most important of these Irish movements was witnessed passing along the
  shores of Killala Bay early in May, 1898 (Saunders, Bnll. Brit. Orn. Club, vii. p. 58).
ON BIRD MIGRATION.  411

     In Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, so far as actual records are concerned,

the White Wagtail is decidedly uncommon on passage in the spring.
    It is not until we reach the coast of Haddingtonshire that we have

any adequate information regarding the passage of the present species
along the east coast. Here, thanks to information privately supplied to

me by my friend Mr. Wm. Evans, it is possible to find the bird in

numbers, sometimes in considerable numbers, by looking for it, in April
and at the beginning of May. I have myself seen the bird in both

spring and autumn on the southern shores of the Firth of Forth.
     North of this the only definite record for the eastern mainland known

to me refers to its occurrence at Inverness during April.

     In the northern isles of Orkney and Shetland there are a considerable
number of records of Pied Wagtails (J/, lugubris) during the late days
of Api-il and early May, for the Pentland Skerries in Orkney and for
Whalsey Skerries and Dunrossness in Shetland, which, I have little dovxbt,
from the lateness of the dates, refer to the passage of the White Wagtail.^

     Saxby - records the bird from Unst on two occasions in spring, namely,

for June 1854 and May 1867. I am, however, not a little dubious as to

the identity of certain migratory flocks of Pied Wagtails which that

observer mentions as appearing in the spring on their way north, and
again in September on their way south, for that bird is an uncommon

--species in Scandinavia.''
     Autumn Vassage. The return movement from the north is initiated by
the appearance of the White Wagtail upon our coasts from mid-August
onwards. The earliest date I have is for August 15, 1894, at Barra. From

this date until the middle of September it occurs in parties proceeding

south at the Hebridean stations of Barra and Tiree ' with great regu-

larity.

     The autumn passage, however, is not a prolonged one, and the latest
record for the bii'd's occurrence in Britain, known to me, refers to a pair

of adults observed in Oxfordshire on September 27, 1885.''
      The return movement probably aff'ects both the east and west coasts

of the mainland, as the data faintly indicate. It is remarkable, however,
that outside the Hebrides and the Forth area our information is of a very
meagre nature, and the bird does not appear to have been observed on
the east coast of England, or anywhere in Ireland in the autumn.**

      ' During a visit to the southern portion of Shetland in the latter half of September,
1900, I found the White Wagtail abundant on passage ; not a single example of the

Pied Wagtail was observed.

     - Birds pf Shetland, p. 81.
     ^ At Heligoland the spring passage of the White Wagtail commences at mid-
March, and continues until the early days of May.
     * The Hebridean records (1892-1899) for the autumn migration of this species

are as follows :-- 1892, September 1 ; 1893, August 24, 25, and 29 ; 1894, August 15 ;

1896, August 24 ; 1897, August 17 and September 2 and 3 ; 1898, August 24, Septem-

ber 7 and 15 ; 1899, August 18.
      ^ Since the above was written, a single bird was noted in Southern Shetland on

October 3, 1900.

    « On the west shores of the Continent the autumn passage is regularly observed.
At Heligoland it commences at mid-August, and continues until mid-October.

     During our ill-fated visit to the island of Ushant, which lies immediately to
the south of our extreme south-west coast, in early September 1898, Mr. Laidlaw

and I saw many White Wagtails on migration. On some days as many as two
hundred came under our notice, and parties of from twenty to thirty were not

uncommon.
412 REPORT 1900.

The White Wagtail is frequently noted in company with its Pied and

Yellow congeners (il/. lugubris and M. raii). It sometimes occurs at the

lanterns of the lighthouses along with other species ; thus at Skerryvore,
on September 8, 1897, several were killed during a rush of 'small birds,'

Wheatears (Saxicola oenanthe), and Pipits [Anthus pratensis), and their

ivings sent to me for identification.

It appears to me that the White Wagtails which traverse our western

shores and isles are probably en route to and from their western summer

haunts in the Faeroes and Iceland. That such is the case is rendered likely

not only by the routes followed in Britain, but by the dates of arrival

and departure as recorded for Iceland.'

    On the other hand, the comparatively late date on which this bird is

observed in the autumn in Southern Scandinavia,^ and the fact that its

numbers are so few on our eastern seaboard, seem to indicate that the

main route to north-western continental Europe does not lie on the

British coasts.

There can be little doubt that the White Wagtail is still much over-

looked as a British bird, or confounded with the Pied Wagtail, a species

Wefrom which it was not differentiated for many years.  have thus even

yet much to learn concerning its distribution in most districts of Great

Britain and Ireland.

In certain areas, notably in the Hebrides, our knowledge has been

considerably advanced during recent years, thanks to the excellent

observations made by Dr. MacBury and Mr. Peter Anderson.

     The main facts connected with the migration of the White Wagtail

are :

     1. It appears on the southern coast of England dui-ing March and
April, sometimes in early May.

   --2. During April and May as late as the middle of the latter month
-- it occurs on passage on the east and west coast of Great Britain, and

has been at that time occasionally observed on the north-west coast of

Ireland.

     3. The return passage commences with mid- August, and is over by

mid-September.

     4. The west coasts of Britain, and especially those of the Hebridean
Islands, form the main route followed by the migrants.

     5. The bird has not been observed on the east coast of Ireland at any
season, nor has it been observed anywhere in Ireland during the autumn

passage.

     ' In 1886 the species was first observed at Keykjanes on April 24, next on the
29th, and abundantly on May 9. Lastly, on August! 3 (Gunnlaugsson, Ornis, 1895,
p. 344). Grondal says it is the first sunamer visitor, and comes in April to the
Reykavik district, where one was shot as late as September 7, 1879 (Ornis, 1886,
p. 358). The bird evidently leaves Iceland early in the autumn. Along with
jyir. Backhouse, I spent the month of September 1884 in the south-east portion of the
island, and we only observed this species on one occasion, namely, a family party
seen on the coast on the 10th.

     - Professor Collett (^Orersigt af Christiania Omegns ornithologiske Faima, p. 84)
states that it arrives d\iring the first half of April, and leaves at the end of Septem-
ber and first days of October. It is occasionally observed in October, and exception-
ally as late as November 15.

     6. It has not been observed on the east coast of England durincr the
autumn passage.

    7. Much has yet to be learned concerning the White Wagtail as a bird

of passage in districts in which it is presumed to be rare or unknown.

received only for two stations, namely, Zomba, which is in the immediate

charge of Mr. J. McClounie, the director of the scientific department, and

Lauderdale, the residence of our esteemed correspondent, Mr. John W.
Moir. No reports from Fort Johnston have been received, and those from

thirteen other stations are more or less incomplete, owin^ to the occa-

sional absence or the illness of the observers. Dr. James E. Mackay, of

the London Missionary Society, whose valuable report for Kambola we
published last year, has, we regret to say, given up his meteorological work,

owing to ill health and the impossibility of finding a trustworthy native

assistant. He writes : ' I see no way to get regular observations, and

have, with great regret, resolved to gi\'e it up rather than provide unre-

liable and worthless reports.'

  --British East Africa. Returns from ten stations have been received

including three months' observations from Nairobi, to the north of

Machako's. The returns from Fort Smith, in Kikuyu, and from the

neighbouring Scottish missionary station being incomplete, we defer their

publication until next year, as we hope shortly to receive the returns for
the missing months. No report has been received from Golbanti, on the
Tana River. As an instance of the extent to which an injudicious exposure
of the thermometers may afiect the returns we refer to the ' Notes ' on those

REVISION OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONSTANTS OF SEA-WATER. 421

--The Revision of the Physiccd and Chemical Constants of Sea^ Water.

    Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir John Murray (^Chair-

     man), Mr. J. Y. Buchanan, F.R.S., Dr. H. K. Mill, Mr. H. N.
     Dickson (Secretary). (Brawn lup Inj the Secretary.)

The Committee was appointed to co-operate in the investigations under-

taken by Dr. Martin Knudsen at Copenhagen, at the instance of the

Committee appointed by the International Conference held at Stockholm

last year, with the view of making authoritative determinations of the

constants used in reducing observations of the physical and chemical

conditions of sea-water in different parts of the globe.

The grant placed at the disposal of the Committee has been expended

in defraying part of the cost of Dr. Knudsen's researches.

Dr                    Knudsen reports  that  the  work  of  obtaining samples  of  water  from
                   .

different regions has been completed, except with regard to those from the

East Greenland polar current, the northern part of the Baltic, and the

Indian Ocean, which it is hoped will be received in about a month's time

The samples have been collected in six-litre bottles, prepared by standing

full of hot water for a month before use . Dr . Knusden and his assistants

began preliminary work in September last, and since May the regular

analyses of samples have been carried on by himself, two chemists, and three

physicists. The results obtained so far indicate that the methods em-

ployed are adequate in scope and precision, and sufficient progress has been

made to justify the expectation that the work will be completed and pub-

lished within the time arranged by the Stockholm Committee.

The Committee do not ask to be reappointed.

The markets in which organised dealings for future delivery are carried
on are concerned with many kinds of I'aw produce. It appears to the

Committee that the circumstances of the markets which are concerned
Avith such products as wheat, maize, cotton, and the like are so different
from those in which the metals are dealt in, that no advantage would

result from presenting an investigation of the two groups on common
                                                                 --

lines. The one group of commodities manifests the general characteristic

that the supply is not continuously produced, but that, speaking broadly,

the supply for a year depends upon the results of a harvest which falls
within a limited part of the year ; the demand for consumption is, how-

ever, one which exists throughout the year, being rovighly continuous.

The work of dealers in these commodities is, therefore, to arrange

relations between a spasmodic supply and a continuous consumption.

With products of which metals may be taken as the type, there does not

exist the same dependence of supply on the I'ound of the seasons.

Demand fluctuates ; but supply can, if necessary, be organised so as to
provide a continuous output calculated to meet a steady demand of large or

of small dimensions. It seems reasonable to suppose that the influence of

the market organisation for future dealings on price and supply will not

follow identical lines in cases so widely contrasted. As, further, the

interest in the subject referred to the Committee is, in the main, derived

from the questions raised in reference to farm products (and particularly

in reference to grain), the Committee propose to confine their report to

this section of the material which the reference to them might be con-

sidered to cover. Should the questions connected with future dealings in

metals appear of sufficient interest, a separate investigation may be

directed into that subject by a committee suitably constituted.

The problems which arise in connection with future dealings in produce

are in some respects not unlike some of those which are discussed in Sir

Robert Giffen's essay on Stock Exchange Securities, ^ but diiferences

fundamental in their nature distinguish the cases of stock and produce

dealings. If no other difTerence existed, the fact that the existing

supply of raw cotton (for example) will be, in the main, used up in the

course of a year, while at the end of a year the bulk of the existing Stock

Exchange securities will still be found in existence, would differentiate

the two problems sufficiently. The influences which determine the level

of values are certainly not identical in the two cases, so that the points

which are of greatest importance in the discussion of the Stock Exchange

will not necessarily need to be equally fully considered here, nor will the

conclusion in regard  to  what  Sir  E.  Giffen designates '                                                                                                     '

be capable of simple application to what is sometimes called ' fictitious

grain.'

    It may be not superfluous to sketch the leading features of the market
organisation, the influence of which we seek to trace. In so doing, it will
be necessary to remember that we have not simply to consider bargains,

the fulfilment of which is contracted to take place at some future date.
It need not be argued that such bargains are regularly made in every
department of life, and that no very special interest attaches to the
investigation of the influence of the custom of making contracts which,
from the nature of the case, are incapable of instant fulfilment. More-

over, such contracts are, in many cases, eminently speculative, though
greater speculation may occur in cases, where no .such conti-act is made.

not unnecessary to recall such facts, inasmuch as some confusion frequently

arises in reference to the relation of 'futures' and 'speculation.'

     As stated, then, the problem which needs investigation is not the

influence on price movements of forward contracts, such as the purchase

and sale of a cargo of wheat actually on passage which may be sold in

anticipation of its arrival, but of an entirely different class of contracts.

In these contracts one leading feature is that the goods bought and sold

are not dealt in by sample, but their quality is determined by reference to

certain standards established by some responsible organisation. In wheat

the standard may be, for example, as in London (for American wheat),

No.  1, Northern, or, as is usual in  Liverpool,  No.  2,  Winter  (or  Spring)
                                                                                                      ;

in cotton, it may be what is known as middling uplands when American

cotton is in question, ftdly good fair for Egyptian, and similarly in re-

gard to other commodities. The buyer need not be able to discriminate

between good and bad wheat, he may conceivably not be capable of dis-

tinguishing wheat from bai-ley, but the quality of the wheat to which he

becomes entitled is nevertheless determinate. Rules are laid down by the

Associations of Grain Dealers in leading centres such as Chicago, Duluth,

New York, Liverpool, <fcc., for maintaining the standard according to

which any actual parcel of wheat is determined to be of standard gi ade or

not, the American centres further grading into several classes, under

Government supervision. One distinction between dealing by sample

and dealing in standard grades is that in the former case slight differ-

ences would be likely to exist between the qualities to which any two

bargains had reference ; in the latter case all bargains in a standard
grade are on the same level in the matter of the quality of the produce

which is capable of being used for their fulfilment. Further, by custom

or by rule, the quantity dealt in on any contract is, if not the same,

always a multiple of a standard quantity, e.g. 4,800 or 5,000 centals of

wheat in London and Liverpool respectively.

     If, then, the date named for delivery be the same for any two con-

tracts (and the custom of naming, not a day, but a month, or two

months even, within which delivery may be made, helps to produce ready

coincidence in this matter), the only point of difference remaining is the

price. Different contracts for the delivery in one and the same month of

the same number of units (of wheat or cotton or other produce) of the

usual standard grade will, except in the matter of price, be as nearly

identical and as interchangeable for all practical purposes as two bonds of

a municipality for equal amounts, if not as much so as two Bank of England

notes of the same denomination. To the man who has bought and sold

equal amounts of the same grade for the same period of delivery there

remains no concern in the actual goods ; he is concerned merely in the

relation of the prices of the sale and purchase.

     But a further development of the organisation of markets whei-e this

class of business is largely transacted is also of importance, as affecting

the facilities for carrying on such dealings, namely, the establishment of

Clearing Houses, and the introduction of a system of periodical settle-

ments. These are effected daily in some cases, weekly in others, while in

some markets no settlement takes place before the term of the bargain

has expired.

     To indicate the purpose and operation of clearing-houses and short settle-

ments, reference to a hypothetical example may be made. Suppose that

Ain January sells 50,000 centals (or, say,10,000 quarters) of wheat to B,
 424 REPORT-- 1900.

 (The standard grade need not be here specified, provided that the fact that

 the bargain is one in wheat of a named standard grade be remembered.)
 The wheat is to be delivered in May, and the price to be paid is, say, 6s.

 per cental. Suppose the term to i-un out and that B has not found a

 convenient opportunity of reselling at a profit-- in fact, that he expected

 Whenthat the price would rise, while it falls steadily and persistently.
 May comes B must either take charge of the wheat and pay for it in full,

 or, if he has no facilities for doing so, will be forced to sell ; in fact, the

 latter may be his only means of providing the funds with which to pay

 for his purchase. If the price has fallen to 5s. 6d., he realises l,250l

 less than he needs to make this payment. Should this be not a solitary
 contract, but one of a score, averaging equally bad results, the dealer, if
 not a wealthy. man, may find it difficult to provide the means of paying
 for his purchases, and his bankruptcy may prevent such payment being

 made.

     The holder of the wheat. A, may find that such Ba failure of leaves

 him to sell the wheat as best he can, and face the loss the risk of which

 his sale to B ought to have removed from his shoulders. The short-settle-

 ment system aims at reducing the risk of loss due to the assumption by
 weak dealers of risks greater than the funds at their "disposal enable them
 to cover, and thus at rendering business more secure, and, being more se-
 cure, capable of being carried on with nari'ower profits. The parties to the
contract may (or in some cases must) deposit a sum of money sufficient to
 cover any probable loss due to variation of price for a short time, and,
if prices vary beyond what the deposit can make good, must increase the
deposit. Thus, in the above case, the deposit may have been, say, o per

 cent, of the contract price, or 750/. Should the price fall so as to indicate
to one party the loss of the whole of this margin in case of realisation at

the price of the day, he may decide that it is better to accept so much of

loss than to risk a greater, and he is helped to this decision by the need of

providing the means of meeting a greater loss, should it occur. The man
who would be most likely to fail to meet his obligations on their maturity
being, in general, the man most likely to find it difficult to spare the
deposit money from his business capital, is precisely the man who is, so to

speak, warned off by the pressure of the need to maintain the deposit.
In the case assumed, were the official price to fall to 5s. lid. on some
day shortly following the conclusion of the contract, the buyer would be
required to find 50,000 pence, or 2081. 6s. 8d., and to pay it, together
with a further margin. Should a further fall occur he would need to pay
a corresponding sum, while, in case of a recovery, he would be entitled to

receive part of his deposit again. This necessity to face losses as they

occur may be a hardship to a man whose ultimate forecast of profit is

realised, should the market go against him steadily and heavily for a con-

siderable part of the period between the contract and the due date of its
fulfilment. Yet, on the whole, the short-settlement system and the putting

up of margins do certainly tend to prevent men from assuming risks
beyond the power of their means to cover. The fact that, to persons who
would have no desire to make a contract for future delivery of goods and

to accept delivery in due course, a facility is afibrded to operate on the
market and to attempt to snatch profits fron day-to-day fluctuations in

prices, the daily (or weekly) settlement enabling them to make their
attempt and be very shortly free of all responsibility in regard to it, not
needing even to wait for the distant delivery month for the realisation of
ON FUTURE DEALINGS IN RAW PRODUCE.  425

       the profit (if any) they may make, has been used to cast odium on the

         system of short intermediate settlements. It is true that the system does
        offer facilities for speculation in mere price- movements as distinct from

        dealing in commodities, but the other fact must also be borne in mind
        that it serves to check wild speculation by weak dealers unable to meet
        the losses which they were nevertheless very ready to face before the

        system was introduced.
             The example of direct dealing between two persons, which has been

        used, will not serve to give an accurate idea of the situation. It is

       common to have a large number of persons involved in such transactions.

     ANot only have we selling to B, but B to C, C to D, and so on for a

        score of links perhaps. The liquidation of such a transaction is greatly

I facilitated by bringing the first seller and the last buyer into direct relations

         with each other, since the intermediate dealers are concerned (unless in
         case of a failure to fulfil contracts) only with the differences between
        the prices at which they have bought and sold respectively. Thti
        unravelling of the complex series of payments and passing of delivery

       orders, &c., which, in a long series, involved delay and difficulty when
       no organisation for the purpose existed, is, in many leading markets,
       accomplished through the medium of a clearing-house. It is unnecessai-y
        to describe the organisation in any detail,' though the existence of these
        facilities must be borne in mind, inasmuch as purely speculative transac-
        tions, as well as the process of dealing in which actual delivery of goods

         takes place, appear to profit by them. In particular, one feature has
        attracted some attention and provoked adverse criticism, namely, that
        where the necessities of business bring about a state of things in
        which the original seller becomes in turn a buyer of the same delivery,
        the series of dealers, A, B, C, D, ikc, ends as well as begins with A, and
        the passing of any warehouse receipt or other form of claim to a specific
        lot of goods becomes a mere form. The interests of all parties in such
        a closed ring are confined to price differences. The settlement of such

       transactions by the process of ' ringing out,' when an invoice and a formal
        tender are passed round the ring, appears to some to indicate an objection-
       able facility afforded to those who practically bet on price-changes, and
        it is apparently desired in some quarters to suppress these facilities in

         order to suppress the transactions thus described.

             The result of the elaborate organisation of markets for dealing in
        futures in commodities is that it has become possible to buy or sell for
        future delivery without difficulty, and at prices publicly and regularly
       quoted. Those who desire to ensure supplies of any commodity for
        which a market so organised exists can do so without difficulty, while
       those who desire to secure themselves against future fluctuations in the
        price of raw produce, whether as buyers or sellers, are provided with
        the means of doing so.

             Attention must be particularly given to the use of dealings in
        futures in providing insurance against price-changes, for no small
        amount of importance attaches both directly and indirectly to this.
        It accounts, in part, for the fact, so troublesome to some critics, that far

        larger amounts of produce are sold for future delivery than could possibly
        be delivered. The tenderable quality is determinate, and though there

below the standard quality are, as in some cases, permitted, the limits

of such deficiency in quality which are acceptable are narrow, and a

pecuniary allowance must be made for the deficiency.

The purchase or sale of regular futures- contracts is made, however,

to serve as a hedge against too great loss from the variation in price

of classes of produce not actually deliverable on such contracts, and,

indeed, for some dealings in goods produced from the raw material to

which contracts refer. This use of the futures-contract depends on the

fairly close accord between the movements in price of different quali-

ties of the same commodity. The accord is not exact, but it generally

suffices to render the hedge effective in some degree. To illustrate, we

take the spot prices of middling American cotton and good fair Per-

nambuco at Liverpool on March 29 and May 17 of the current year.

The former stood at 5j%o?. at the earlier date, 5^d. at the later. The
Pernambuco quotations were Qd. and 5^d. Of the variation of -Id. shown
in the latter price, y/jrf. were shared by the former. Hence, in a great

degree, futures in American would have served as a hedge against

variations in price of Pernambuco almost as well as against variations

in price of American itself. As a direct insurance in dealings in the same

commodity as that named in the futures-contract, that contract is

obviously serviceable. An importer who purchases a shipload of wheat,

anticipating to sell it on arrival at a certain price, will sell futures
to an amount corresponding to the quantity of actual wheat he has

bought. If the price has fallen when the goods arrive, the amount received

from their sale will be reduced, but, on the other hand, the cost of

repurchase of the futures-contract will have also fallen, and to an

amount which will cover the bulk, if not the whole, of the loss on the

sale of the actual grain. So, also, in case of a forward sale, the risk of

loss through price-variation may be eflfectively insured against by a

pui-chase and subsequent resale of a futures-contract.

The facility of dealing in these contracts, then, affords a means of

reducing risk of financial loss in the handling of the actual produce,

both that which is of such quality as to be tenderable on the contracts,

and that which is not of such quality. Its use in covering the latter class

of dealings leads to a considerable excess of dealings in futures over actual

deliveries of tenderable grades. Now, in considering the influence on

prices of the modern system of dealings in futures, the reduction of the

risk assumed by various sections of dealers must be given a prominent

place. The margin of profit which is sufficient to support dealings of

a comparatively safe character is much smaller than that necessary

when risk is considerable. Even though the goods pass through the

hands of more numerous dealers than formerly, the cost of handling

have been unable to obtain any satisfactory means of determining to what

extent the cost of handling (apart from elevator charges and freight

charges) has been reduced, but we have seen no reason for supposing tha.t

it has been increased, as seems to be suggested by some who direct atten-

tion to the large number of hands through which a futures -contract may

pass, and the accumulation of commissions which is suggested in conse-

quence. The fact that dealings in wheat futures in Liverpool, for

example, amount to from twelve to twenty or thirty times the amount of

the wheat actually tendered against these dealings, does not necessarily
imply that every quarter of imported wheat has to bear the weight of a
score of commissions to brokers for handling futures-contracts.

     It seems hardly necessary to repeat at length what has been sufficiently

often made clear, that the futures- contract entered into by a dealer who
actually proposes to demand delivery of, or make a tender of, the produce

represented by it, cannot be distinguished from the contract entered into

by a dealer who does not propose to handle either the goods named in the

contract or any other goods in respect of the price-variations of which

the said contract may be used as a hedge. The point may be made clear

by giving an example of the actual form used, selecting for that purpose

The examination of this form will suflSce to show that it would be a

practical impossibility to distinguish the simple gambling from the (so-

called) legitimate dealings for the purpose of suppressing the former.

Apart from objections to gambling as gambling, the allegations as to the

effect of modern dealings in futures appear to attribute to them influences

of two kinds : (a) that they tend to depress prices, and are in fact respon-
sible for much of the fall in price of such commodities as wheat and cotton

which has taken place in the    last  twenty-fiye      years                     (6)  that they cause
                                                                              ;

determined by the transactions of dealers handling the actual goods alone.

It will be convenient to consider these views separately, and to make such

comparisons of the actual course of market-prices as seem most likely to

throw light on the subject.

First is the influence on the general price-level. The reason for

asserting that this has been depressed by dealings in futures appears to

be, when the statements of the advocates of this view are considered,

chiefly that other causes are inadequate to produce the result actually

Weexperienced.  do not think it is necessary to support our dissent from

this view by indications of the influences to which the fall in some prices,

especially those of wheat, maize, and other grain, should be attributed.

To do so would be to travel far outside the matter referred to us. It will

suffice to say that we hold it to be necessary to show how the operation

of the futures- market can depress the general price-level of the goods dealt

in. In only one way can we admit a real depressing influence, and that

is through reducing the cost of handling : i.e., the price may be reduced to

the consumer without a reduction of price to the producer of the raw com-

modity by cheapening the marketing (as well as the freight) charges.

Such a reduction of price would reduce the return to all those producers

between whom and the consuming regions but little expense of carriage

intervened. It is an important point to examine, therefore, whether the

return received by the American farmer in the great wheat-producing

--areas has been reduced largely whether it has been reduced as much pro-

portionately as have prices generally. This is a point not very easy to

determine. The U.S. Department of Agriculture compiles a figure

which is given as the average farm-price of wheat at the beginning of

December. Comparing this with the average export-price of wheat from

the U.S., we have (see for extended table Appendix) :--

Y,,,,_,,        Average farm price. Years ending          Average export price.

two prices. The freight-rates from Chicago to New York,^ compiled by

of the all-rail rate of over 12 cents per bushel, of the lake-and-rail rate

     The reduced cost of transportation seems, in the light of these figures,
capable of accounting for all, and maybe more than all, the diff"erence
between the fall in the farm and export prices. If these figures were
really representative, the conclusion would be that charges other than
freight have possibly increased, since the fall in price falls short of the

fall in freight, by the all-rail routes, between Chicago and New York.

It is not, however, satisfactory to compare the fall of price at a parti-

cular date in the year on the farm with the average fall registered in a

Ayear.  distinctly useful corrective to the idea that the prices of recent

years at places near the great producing regions are without precedent, is

afforded by the record of monthly averages of prices of wheat at Cin-

cinnati which are given in the ' Cincinnati Price- Current ' (for table see

Appendix). The range of prices of the ten years 1844-53 would compare

quite closely with those of the past fifteen years. The lowest figures, those of

1894, do not touch the level reached in the course of 1846. It is true that

--for long periods-- for example in the dozen years ending 1882 the fluctua-

tions of price centred about a level some 50 per cent, above that about which

the fluctuations of 1844-53, or those of the years since 1885, have centred.

But it does not seem necessary to invoke the aid of the modern market

organisation to account for a return to the level of half a century ago.

It is further of importance to recall the fact that in another great

staple, cotton, the lowest prices of recent years hardly fell below those

registered early in the century. The table of average prices of middling

American cotton, which is given in the Appendix {cf. p. 435), shows that,,

whatever may be the influences which have depressed the prices of cotton

of late years, the level reached is practically that of the period before the

American Civil War. Any suggestion of the need of an influence from

the futures-market to produce the actual result would appear unnecessary.

It may be granted that absolute certainty cannot, on this point, be
Areached from the examination of statistical compilations.
                                                            considera-

tion of the matter from the point of view of the probable influence of an

active futures-market, however, shows no point where a permanent de-

pressing influence can arise. The facilities for short-selling are, it is

true, considerable, but the 'bear' must cover his sales, and hence he

must, in the end, support the market by buying. And, it may be added,

the organisation aflPords as great facilities to the ' bull ' as to the ' bear,' so

that, whatever the effect on the fluctuations of price, the increase of both

buying and selling would hardly produce a strong pressure which, in the

long run, is all in one direction. The depressing effect of sales of wind-

wheat is hardly the same as in the stock markets is produced by the in-

troduction of fictitious securities. The sales, as stated, must be covered

by purchases, and that within a limited time. Hence the nature of the

commodities ' fictitious wheat ' and ' fictitious securities ' is not the

same.

   A not uninstructive illustration is afforded by the recent experience

of the Berlin market. As a result of the Bourse Law of 1896, the active
dealings in that market have been restricted within very much narrower

limits than formerly. The form of contract which is no longer legal there
is still legal in Liverpool, London, Amsterdam, and elsewhere, and to these

centres much of the business formerly transacted in Berlin is practically

transferred. Berlin is cut off from that close contact with the world-

market which was maintained so long as the methods of transacting busi-
ness there were similar to those in use elsewhere. The result is shown in

the annexed table (p. 430), showing the average level of price in Liverpool,
Amsterdam, and Berlin in each of the last eight years, from which it will
be seen that the check on futures business in that market has certainly

not raised the price there relatively to that on the great markets of the

world. Berlin prices have shown, indeed, a smaller excess over those
representing the free markets of Europe since than before the Bourse

Law. It should be added that there has been no change in the customs
duty on wheat or rye to nullify the comparison.

ployed. It seemed possible, however, that some serious fluctuations

would escape notice in this measui-e, in cases where rapid but only

Aterised the market quotations.
                                 few very large variations seemed

capable of outweighing numerous smaller but quite serious movements.

To avoid possibility of a misleading result, therefore, the mean actual

difference between each quotation and that immediately following it has

also been calculated, and forms a second measure of the degree of varia-

bility of the price. In these comparisons the movements of wheat prices

have been deemed suflicient.

The available series of daily quotations did not extend over a

sufficiently long period to make their use for our purpose quite satisfac-

tory. To test in some degree how far less frequent quotations might be

used without greatly disturbing the index obtained, some calculations

were made of the Standard Deviation for certain daily quotations and

other weekly quotations. The results indicate that the relative intensity
of fluctuations may be fairly well measured by weekly prices.

It may be added that the S.D. of a series of weekly prices coincided

with remarkable closeness to that of a monthly series derived from them

over a period of half a century. The percentage of standard deviation to

Weaverage price is not widely different in the two cases.      have, there-

fore, considered that the relative steadiness of prices may be sufficiently

indicated from the weekly prices afforded in the Gazette Average Price of
English Wheat. Has the English farmer been subject to a less or greater

degree of fluctuation in the price of his wheat since futures-markets have
dominated those prices ?

      In the diagram annexed (see Appendix, Plate IV.), and in the tables
which accompany it, the comparison over fifty years is shown. Calendar
years have been used because the use of a fixed date from which to reckon
the cereal year introduced the difficulty that it sometimes threw price-

movements of two harvests into one so-called cereal year. Were the

cerea,! year able to be taken, the fluctuation shown might be somewhat
reduced. The computation of the S.D. for these years, making each
year begin with September, has been made, and no great difference"would
be shown had those results been plotted on the diagram in place of
those for calendar years. The summary of the tables in the Appendix

is as follows :

for the disturbance due to the Leiter corner, the period of comparative

from violent fluctuations, sets in precisely at the time when the organisa-

ponents attribute malign results.

This Committee was appointed at the Ipswich Meeting of the British

Association in 1895, to consider repeated complaints that screws of the

British Association thread, proposed by the Committee of 1882, obtained

commercially, were not satisfactorily interchangeable. It was evident

that the difficulty arose from the want of proper gauges, or other ready

means of testing screw threads, and the Committee at once took steps to

find out how these could be obtained. In a report presented at the Dover

Meeting of the Association last year (1899) were described the eflbrts we

had made to secure the production of these gauges, and to make them
Wegenerally available in a commercial way.
                                            reported that a high degree

of accuracy in dimensions, though not in form, had been attained in a
small number of specimens submitted to us by the Pratt and Whitney

Company ; that these were the product of exceptional skill and care ; and

that they were only obtained after long delay. These gauges were suffi-

ciently good for all practical requirements, and had gauges of the same

character been generally available some years before, it is probable that

the complaints which led to the appointment of this Committee would

never have been made. Taking into consideration the difficulty that had
been met in obtaining these gauges ; the representations made by the
manufacturers of the difficulty in producing them, and of the comparative

ease with which a flat-topped thread can be accurately formed ; and the

fact that such screws are used in foreign countries for the best class of

engineering work, we reported that the form of the British Association

thread was unsatisfactory, and recommended that the Committee should

be reappointed to consider its modification.

   A proposal to alter the form of an established and generally satisfac-
ON THE SMALL SCKEVV GAI!GE.  437

tory system of screw threads may cause some apprehension among users
of them, and the Committee, many members of which are intimately

acquainted with the trouble and inconvenience incidental to a change of

 the kind, recognise that very substantial reasons are required to justify it.

They think it desirable that the considerations which have led them to
make this proposal should be fully stated.

      Consideration of the exact cause of the difficulty found in the con-
 struction of gauges for the British Association thread showed immediately
that it was due to the rounded tojj and bottom of the thi-ead. There is
no difficulty in making any given angle between the straight portions or
sides of the generating tool or chaser, but to arrange that these straight

lines shall, at definite points, turn smoothly into circular arcs of a given

radius is a matter of some difficulty. The difficulty has been met with a
good deal of success. The original threads, cut by Mr. Lehmann, and
those produced recently by the Pratt and Whitney Company, are admirable
specimens of workmanship, especially when the small size of the pieces
is considered ; and to the careful work done by Mr. Lehmann in the years
following 1 882, when originating the threads, the success they have
achieved is largely due. The production, however, of chasers, even if it
can be repeated indefinitely, does not end the difficulty. The hardening
of the screws produced by these tools introduces some inaccuracy. They
are no longer perfectly straight, perfectly cylindrical, or of perfectly
accurate pitch, and the only way to correct them is by grinding. The
inaccuracies produced by hardening are not of sufficient importance to
affect the use of taps, and in the case of die-plates the errors produced in
the diametei's are corrected by opening or closing the die ; but for gauges
corresponding to modern ideas of mechanical accuracy the errors pro-
duced by hardening are considerable, and much greater than those found
in screws whose forms can be finally obtained by grinding. With the
British Association thread this process does not seem to be practicable
except perhaps in single specimens, and in this lies the inherent defect of

the thread.

   A way out of the difficulty ia offered by the adoption of a flat-topped

thread, but before this can be discussed it is necessary to consider what
are the peculiar advantages of the rounded thread, which have brought it
into general use, and led to its adoption by the original Committee. The
British Association thread was taken with a slight modification directly
from Professor Thury's SavIss system, which had been constructed by
finding a formula to represent the average existing practice among Swiss
clockmakers. Sir Joseph Whitworth formed his sj'stem of screws in a
similar way by averaging the English engineering practice of his time. It
appears that the object in view in both these cases was to regularise exist-
ing practice, not to effect a reform ; and that an alteration in the form of
thread in common use was not contemplated. The same was done in
America for the United States thread, so far as the pitches and diameters
were concerned, but the form of the thread was determined by Dr. Sellers
on general considerations. The origin of the round thread in the British
Association system was in the common practice of the Swiss workshops

when the rule was constructed. Now, whatever may be the prescribed shape

of the thread, it is certain that small screws, produced on screw machines,

will have rounded tops, and if a new rule for American threads were con-
structed from the shapes of ordinary small screws found in the United
States, the form obtained would have a rounded top, notwithstanding that

they are all supposed to represent the flat-topped Sellers thread. Since
--438 REPORT 1900.

a screw machine tends to produce rounded threads, and the natural course

of trade conditions tends to the reproduction of current forma, the common

use in Switzerland of screws with rounded threads does not necessarily
show that such a form has especial merit, or had originally been delibe-

rately designed. It may be only the result of working conditions.

Professor Thury, in defining his thi'ead, chose a form which could be easily
produced with fair accuracy, is perfectly etlicienc, and can be conformed

                                                                  Fig. 1.

 to in practice, but we venture to think it fails to meet other important

 conditions

      To ascertain the conditions which should determine the form of a
 screw thread, consider the mode of action of a screw holding two pieces
 together. In fig. 1 the screw serves to hold the plate a to the solid
 part u, and a small part of the thread is drawn on a larger scale below.
 The action of the screw depends on the tensile strain due to the pressure
ON THE SMALL SCREW GAUGE*  439

produced over the surfaces aa, a a, . . . , and the compression produced
there by the act of screwing up relieves any pressure over the surfaces
hb, bb, . . . , Contact and pi-essure at the points c c c . . . depend on
the relative diameters of the screw and the tapped hole. The spaces
shown in the figure along the surfaces b b, b b, . . . ai-e of course greater

than would occur in a well-titted screw. Now if the thread may be looked

upon merely as a means of supporting the tensional strain on the bolt,
without offering much frictional resistance to screwing up, it is clear that
this will be most efficiently done if the pressure is evenly supported over
the whole of the working surface of the thread a a, a a, . . ., and within
the assigned dimensions of the thread this surface should be as large as
possible. Contact and pressure at the points c, c, . . . depending on the

respective diameters of the screw and the tapped hole may interfere with

the fair contact of the working surfaces, involve extra resistance to screw-
ing up, and, so far as the support of the tensional strain is concerned, serve
no useful purpose. The best design for the thread, in view of its function
of supporting the tension, is that which secures most perfectly a continuous
working contact over the surface a a, a a, . . ., and freedom frooi pressure
at other points. These conditions are met best by a thread having straight
sides, a flat top, and a clearance space at the top and bottom of the thread
such as is shown in fig. 2 (p. 441). The provision of straight sides gives
a form to the originating tool which can be j^roduced with more ease and
accuracy than one of a curved form, and assists to secure correspondence
between the surfaces of the sci'ew and nut : the provision of a flat top gives
the largest possible area to the working surface within the given limits of
the thread : the provision of a clearance space at top and bottom removes
the possibility of any interference with the fit of the working surface by
irregularities of form at those points, and avoids unnecessary friction.

Screws with straight sides and flat tops are perfectly satisfactory in in-
strument practice, are employed in France and Germany for the most
important engineering work, and are uni'v'ersal in America for work of all

Wekinds, for instrument work as well as heavy engineering work.

understand that the provision of clearance is well recognised in the practice

of American and French engineers, who use the Sellers thread, and Mr.

Hewitt, at Prescot, gives a very liberal clearance in the screws manu-

factured by him. The ease with which such threads are originated is a
point in their favour, though it would be of small importance if it were
shown that the thread is practically defective in other ways.

     As regards the reduction of the sectional area of the core by the pro-
posed deepening of the thread, the figures tibtained by Messrs. Gorham and
Price, corroborated by common experience, show that screws give way
under tension by breaking across the core rather than by stripping their

 threads or those of the nuts ; and it has been urged against the proposal to
 deepen the thread that it weakens the screw in its already weakest part.
 The reply to this is that the strength of the screw is really determined by

 the strength of the core, and that the British Association series is so
 closely spaced that a screw can always be found whose core is of the
 required size. Moreover, in well-designed work, screws have so large a
 factor of safety that a reduction of the section of the core by an amount
 varying from 8 per cent, in large screws to 12 per cent, in small screws
 will not generally be a matter of great importance, though it will be
 remembered tliat the resistance to torsional fracture varies inversely as

 the square of the sectional area.

                                                                                            ,

The adoption of a flat-topped thread with a clearance would, we

believe, completely obviate the difficulty of producing satisfactory gauges,

the question to which the attention of this Committee was originally
directed. The construction of these is referred to later in the report.

Other elements of the screw have received the attention of the Committee

as follows.

Mr. George M. Bond, of the Pratt and Whitney Company, has

expressed to the Committee a strong opinion that the angle of 60°

employed in the Sellers thread is most suitable for screws because of the

ease with which it is formed. Tools can be ground without ditficulty,
and with great accuracy, to any desired angle, and Mr. Bond's reason

appears to the Committee insufficient of itself to justify a change in

practice. Considering, however, the extent to which screws of tlie

Sellers form are employed in foreign engineering work, the Committee

desired to obtain some evidence of the exact value of the particular angle

of 60°, since, if this angle wei-e found to possess a great advantage over

the angle of 47^°, the adoption of the Sellers thread would have the

additional recommendation of bringing the small screw pi'actice into line

with an already extensive engineering pi'actice, while giving effect to the

conclusions already reached by the Committee of the desirability of clear-

ance and a flat-topped thread. Some experiments on lines suggested by
Mr. Crompton have been carried out by Messrs. J. Marshall Gorhain

and AV. A. Price, and their results are printed as an appendix to this
report. They concluded that an angle of 47V' is better for ?^-crevvs than
an angle of 60°, on the ground that it offers much less frictional resistance

to screwing and unscrewing on a given tensional load, and the general

tendency of this observation is corroborated by tiie practice of using a

thread for the leading screws of lathes, the screws of carpenters' clamps,

and of screw jacks, in which the working surface is perpendicular to the

axis of the screw. Another consideration leads us to think it undesirable

to adopt an angle of 60°. The advantage of bringing small screw-practice

into line with that of foreign engineers will only be fully gained if their

rule for the size of the flat top of the thread is also adopted. This rule

gives a maximum possible clearance of -108 pitch when the thread is cut

Vto a perfectly sharp -"it the bottom. This clearance would be sufficient

V<ut tools with perfectly .sharp points are maintained with difliculty, and

Ait would not generally obtain.  tool of 47^°, ground to give a clearance

of -1 of the pitch, has a flat at the point one-seventh of the pitch wide.

For small screws Professor Thury's angle of 47V° had the same sanction

of practice among clockmakers as a larger angle had among engineers

when  it was  adopted  by Dr. Sellers                                                                              and  though  it is often  difficult  to

assign exact reasons for the particular practice of practical men, yet it

caimot be disi-egarded unless the reasons for its use are quite clear, and

Wearc sliown to be insufficient.  see no sufficient reason to change the

preseiit angle of 47.\°, especially as a change of angle would make existing

stocks and tools altogether useless in conjunction with the existing form.

The existing series of pitches and diameters, with their designating

numbers, is generally approved, and the Committee have received no sug-

gestion that it is otherwise than satisfactory.

Thus far it has been assumed that, given the necessary tools, all forms

of thread can be produced with the same ease. This, however, does not

apply to the small screws used in watches, which are produced by turning

the blanks into a hard die without cutting edges. In such a process

re-entrant angles, or to make it flow past sharp corners. On this point

Mr. C. J. Hewitt writes to the Committee respecting the proposed altera-

Ation of the British Association thread : ' die of this operating character

for screws Hatted top and bottom soon loses its contour, and needs con-

stant replacement ; and in addition my experience leads me to believe

that it requires more force than a rounded thread ; therefore it sets up

or in English measure below -059 inch. The Committee propose to
modify the form of thread of the screw of the large section only.

     The above considerations lead the Committee to propose to replace
the present form of thread of screws from No. to No. 1 1 inclusive by
the form shown in tig. 2.

thread. It will be observed that the flat part of the side, or the working
surface, is increased by nearly 60 per cent. Accurately formed screws

of this pattern for special purposes can be cut on the lathe with much

greater ease than those with a rounded thread. The screw is cut with

a single-point tool from a cylinder, and in the larger sizes the nut can be

cut with a single-point tool from a cylindrical hole. The difficulty of

forming chasers of a complicated form is entirely avoided. These observa-

tions apply equally to the construction of taps and plates, and of gauge-

pieces. Given that the pitch of the screw and the angle of the thread

are accurate, and the sides straiglit, the ht of the screw in a correct gauge

is determined by the length of the diametral line terminated by the in-

clined sides of the thread, and this dimension is called the effective diameter

of the screv. If this dimension is the same in the screw and the nut, they

will fit without shake independently of the exact values of the external

and internal diameters,                               or of the exact form  of the ends                                                    and the lengths
                                                                                                                                        ;

of the effective diameters of screws and nuts are definite numerical

measures of their fits one with another. The point which it is important

should be right is the straight between A' and B in both nut and screw.

The nut must not pass A', nor the screw pass B ; but so long as the nut
is cut as far as B or farther the shape of the excess does not matter. The

same thing holds with the screw at A', but here excessive clearance is

objectionable because it weakens the core of the screw.

In constructing plug-gauges for testing nuts the straight sides of the

thread can be corrected after hardening by grinding with a lap, and

this process corrects at once the irregularities of pitch Mid angle, and is
continued till the effective diameter is reduced to the desired value. The

top of the thread, being cylindrical, presents no difficulty. The form of
the bottom of the thread is immaterial, since the clear hole in the nut is
most conveniently tested with a cylinder plug- gauge. In the specimens

submitted to us last year by the Pratt and Whitney Company this
cylinder was constructed in one piece with the screwed plug.

      In ring or nut gauges for testing screws a slit is cut through the
tapped hole, and closed with a screw. The hole can be polished by a
corresponding screwed piece, but could only be con-ected by grinding by
the use of very refined appliances. After polishing the slit is closed to
fit a prepared screwed plug, and the clear hole brought to its correct value
with a lap. The process is not so satisfactory as with a plug-gauge, but

the pieces which the ring is designed to test can be satisfactorily measured

in other ways, so that the gauge is of less importance.

The effective diameter of a screw is readily measured in a micrometer

gauge between a conical point and a V notch, both having an angle of
An47^°.
         instrument of this kind constructed for 60° is figured in tool-

makers' catalogues.

     Ordinary taps for nuts or for the working holes in larger pieces will

be different in form from the screws, and diSerent from the taps employed
to make dies or screw-plates. The ordinary dies or plates in a workshop
ON TflE SMALL SCREW GAUGE.  443

used for makiiag sci-ews will not be suitable for making taps. In small

workshops this may sometimes cause mistakes, but in shops having a

se23arate tool-room this extra specialisation should present no difficulty.
     Objections have been raised to the above proposal on three grounds.
     It has been represented to us that in finely fitted work the screws

should fit their holes perfectly and all over, and that the existence of a
clearance gap all round the edge of the thread is inconsistent with a high
standard of workmanship. This objection is evidently to some extent a
matter of opinion, and it is always possible to use taps of the same form

as the screws, so that the screws will fit the taps all over as in a non-

clearance system.

     It has been objected that the introduction of the proposed system will
seriously interfere with existing stocks of screws and the repairs of existing

instruments. In fig. 2 it is' shown that the new thread differs from the

B Bold one by the addition of the small corners, (j h, h k, to the screw,

and d A' e, e A' f, to the nut. In making screws and nuts with dies and
taps, these corners will always be rounded off' to some extent, though the

re-entrant angles at A B' will be as sharp as the tool which makes them.

In some screws and nuts prepared experimentally to test this point, the
outer edges of the thread were fairly rounded, and they were perfectly
interchangeable with the B.A. screws of an existing manufacturer's stock.
The Committee believe that screws made to the proposed new thread will,
owing to the inevitable rounding, be interchangeable with existing stocks
in a great majority of cases, and that only in cases where great care has
been taken to work closely to the old standard will any difference be

noticed.

      It has Ijeen objected that the proposed thread is unsuitable for such

work as bicycles and small arms which are subject to violent concussion
and vibration, whereby the screws are liable to be shaken loose and to
drop out ; and the case of alternating current arc lamps has been Jiien-
tioned to the Committee as one in which the same thing is liable to occur.

Mr. O. P. Clements of the Birmingham >Small Arms Company contri-

butes a paper to the Mechanical Section on the practice of his firm in the
manufacture of screws for bicycle parts, for which it is found necessary

to use rounded threads fitting very closely all over. It is clear that no

one form of thread can be suitable for all purposes, and we have direct
evidence that the form of thread we propose does not fail in instrument
work in the way Mr. Clements anticipates that it would do in bicycle work.

    We beg to report that the system of screw threads recommended by

the British Association for the use of instrument makers, and knoAvn as
the British Association screw threads, should be modified in the following
way for all screws from No. to No. 11 inclusive.

   --For screws. That the designating numbers, pitches, outside diameters,

and the common angle of 47 1° remain unchanged ; but that the top and

bottom of the thread shall be cylindrical, showing flats in section, and
 that the depth of the thread shall be increased by one-tenth of the pitch,
 the diameter of the solid core being, in consequence, diminished by one-

 fifth of the pitch.

   --For nuts. That the designating numbers, the pitches, the diameters

 of the clear holes, and the common angle of 47i° remain unchanged ; but

 that the top and bottom of the thread shall be cylindrical, showing flats
 in section, and that the depth of the thread shall be increased by one-

 tenth of the pitch.

     1. With a steady pull on the specimens the torque required to turn
both screws simultaneously in their nuts was measured. This was ascer-
tained by means of a small spring balance acting by a lever on the hexa-

gonal sleeve F.

     2. The pull of the testing-machine was then steadily increased until
one of the screws was pulled through the nut.

bi"ass nut, at a strain much below the calculated breaking strain. The
form of the fracture was in every case that of the dotted line c, shown in
fig. 3. Professor Unwin, to whom this point was submitted, supposes

that this has no bearing on the strength or weakness of the j^articular
forms of thread used, but was due to internal strains in the steel produced
by the water-hardening, and to a slight bending force acting with maxi-

mum effect at the point where the screw enters the nut. The spherical

seats of the collars C C will not, he points out, wholly prevent the occur-
rence of this force. He suggests that had the screws been hardened in

oil this probably would not have happened. The sectional area of the
cores of the screws was "09.5 square inch, and the breaking strain was
expected to be about 1.3,.500 lb. Those that broke where they entered
the nut broke at 5,600 lb. (60° screw), 5,860 lb. (50° screw), and 5,330 lb.
(40° screw) respectively. In a subsequent test one of them broke along
the line d (fig. 3) at 10,280 lb. Fortunately, in every case a sufficient
length of the screw was left after the accident to put on another nut, and
in each case a satisfactory result was obtained in a subsequent trial, the
screws being drawn thi'ough the nuts without being themselves broken.

     The forms of the screws tested are shown in figs. 5 and 6. The

diameters, both at the top and the bottom of the thread, were the same in

all the screws, and also in all the nuts. The screw threads were in all

cases flat-topped, with slightly rounded, but nearly flat, bottoms. The

pitch of the screw was the same in every case, 16 to the inch. The three

threads had angles respectively of 40°, 50°, and 60°. Each screw was cut

with a single point tool, ground to the correct angle from a cylinder pre-

viously turned to the correct diameter. The nuts were cut with single

point inside turning tools, also accurately ground, in a cylindrical hole

previously bored to the correct diameter.

AThe outside diameter of each screw was -i\- inch (-4375) ; and the inside
diameter of each nut was "3575 inch.       clearance of "005 inch was

given at the top and bottom of the thread in every case.

     In these experiments only one screw and one nut were used in each
pull, the connection to the otlier side of the hexagonal sleeve Ijeing made

with a h" steel bolt. Two nuts of each size were sheared. In this case

no measurements were taken of twisting torque.

(4 threads) made from hard drawn rod.

     2. Another similar screw sheared the nut at 10,820 lb. Area sheared

300 square inch. Shearing force per square inch 36,070 lb.

     In all cases the nut was sheared along the outside surface of the screw,

not at the bottom of its own thread, so that the hole left was a tight fit

for the screw which had been pulled through.

      Tliese figures suggest the following conclusions :

      1. That the angle of a flat-ended thread has little effect on the resist-

ance of the nut to shearing, except so far as it aflects the area of the
surface to be sheared ; and the advantage possessed by the 60° thread
over the others is only due to the fact that its flat top is narrower than

theirs, and the base of the nut thread correspondingly wider. From
analogy with the relative behaviour of sharp and blunted dies used in

stamping, it seems that a flat-topped thread with sharp edges should shear

a nut more easily than a rounded thread.
     2. That the strength of the thread of the nut, compared with that of

the core of the screw, is such tliat generally in practice nuts are stronger

than their screws.
     For example, a flat-ended thread of the dimensions of No. B.A. of

40-ton steel will break before it strips the thread from a hard drawn brass
nut ji^ inch thick. So a similar screw of the dimensions of No. 6 B.A. of
the same steel will break sooner than strip a brass nut jV inch thick.

     With steel nuts the nut will generally be very much stronger than the

screw.
      3. Considering (a) that the holding strength of a screw bolt is generally

determined (and that especially in small screws) by the resistance of the
bolt under tensile stress ; and (b) that, as ascertained by Professor Martens,
the resistance of a screw bolt to fracture is very largely dimiuished by

simultaneous torsional stress ; it is desirable that such resistance as may

be desired to tightening or loosening a bolt should be obtained by means
of the friction of the under surface of the nut or screw head, and that the
friction of the threaded surface of the screw itself should be as small as

Apossible. From this point of view experiments indicate that an angle

of thread of 40° or 50° is to be preferred to an angle of 60°, and that

especially so in the case of small screws.

     The authors of this Report are under a great obligation to Professor T.
Hudson Beare for his kind assistance in ascertaining the breaking strains

of the specimens.

    of Professoi- E. A. Schafer (Chairman), Professor E. Kay

    and Professor A. B. Macallum (Secretary). (Drawn up hij the

       Secretarif)

The work of the Committee was directed along the following lines :

   --1. 27ie Localisation of Phosphorus hi the Cell. In this investigation

a wide range of animal and vegetable forms was employed as material,

and solutions of molybdate of ammonia in nitric acid were used to localise

the phosphorus as a phospho-molybdate compound, the distribution of the

latter being revealed after the preparations were treated with solutions of

phenylhydrazine hydrochloride. The results show that the element exists

in cells in at least five states of combination : (a) As a nuclein or nucleo-

proteid in which the phosphorus is firmly combined in both cytoplasm

and nucleus, (b) As a derivative (nucleinoid) of nuclein or nucleo-

proteid, in which the phosphorus is much less firmly combined. Examples

of this are found in smooth muscle fibre in the dim bands of striated

mu.scle fibre, in the substance constituting the zymogen granules in

secreting glands, and in the outer limbs of the retinal rods and cones,

(c) As an inorganic metaphosphate dissolved in the cytoplasm of some

cells, and apparently derived from a and b. (d) As lecithin, which is

present in every cell, and markedly in nerve tissue, (e) As an inorganic

orthophosphate in the tissues of various organs, e.g. liver, spleen, kidney,

intestinal mucosa, placenta, itc. In the demonstration of the occurrence

of these compounds of phosphorus, the length of time required to demon-

strate their presence is an important factor ; and, further, the metaphosphate

and orthophosphate may be removed from a preparation in a couple of

hours by the action of dilute nitric acid, while lecithin may be extracted
by repeated treatment with hot alcohol. By making preparations of cells

and tissues with the molybdate method, both before and after the action

of dilute nitric acid, as well as before and after extraction with alcohol,

it was found possible in every case to ascertain tlie occurrence of one or

all of these five classes of compounds in a cellular element.

   This investigation has given a very large number of results which are

of too detailed a character to be referred to specially here, and referejices

to which are iiow being incorporated in a special j^aper for publication.

One generalisation from these observations may, however, be in place

here. The organic, usually iron-free, compounds of phosphorus, which are

almost universally present in the cytoplasm of nucleated cells, bear a

derivative relation to those which ai^e in the nucleus, and which contain

'  masked                                    iron,  while  in  non-nucleated  organisms  the  comj^ounds of  iron
                                          '

and phosphorus are found in the cytoplasm in all cases in a diffused form,

but in some also as gi-anules (Cyanophycese and the Yeasts). From the

chemical point of view the nucleus is therefore an organ for containing

the iron-holding nucleo-proteids, and it is therefore an organ of secondary
and later origin in the development of the primal cell organism.

  --2. Tlie Relation of the Iron to the other Elements in the Ghrotnatin or

Nuclein Molecule. In this the point to be determined was whether the
iron atom is directly united to a carbon atom, as it presumably is in

        1900.
450 REPORT-- 1900.

haemoglobin, which is derived from chromatin, or, as Ascoli ^ claims, to the
phosphorus as a polymetaphosphate of iron. For this purpose quantities
of iron holding nuclein, prepared from lamb's testicles, were subjected to
the action of water at 160° to 170^ C, under pressure for four to eight
hours. This brings about a decomposition of the nuclein, setting free the
metaphosphoric acid as the ortho acid. It was found that in the first
four to six hours nearly all the phosphorus of the compound appears in
solution as ortho-phosphoric acid, with traces of iron, the rest of the iron
appearing to be still in organic combination in other decomposition
products either in solution or undissolved. If the iron were combined
with the meta-phosphoric acid it ought to appear as ferric phosphate,
which is soluble in the presence of ortho-phosphoric acid. In the absence
of this result it must, therefore, be held that the iron is directly associated
in the nuclein molecule with some other element, probably carbon.

   --3. On the Localisation of Oxidising Enzijmes in the Cell. For this pur-

pose vmicellular algiv, and more particularly Sjyirogyra, were used. The
tests for these enzymes ai'O not sufficiently delicate to enable one to de-
tect their distribution micro-chemically, but it was found that on subject-
 ng masses of the living Spirogyra threads washed -with distilled water
to various degrees of pressure in a specially niade hydraulic \iVQSs one
obtained solutions of the various ferments the position of each of which
in the cell is approximately determinable by the jaressure used. For ex-
ample, with an initial low pressure the fluid or solution expressed was
largely, if not wholly, from the spaces in the cell surrounding the chro-
matophore and the stellate cytoplasmic mass which contains the nucleus,
while with a considerably greater pressure one obtains cytoplasmic and

nuclear fluids in a second solution, and with the maximum pressui'e the

cytoplasmic and nuclear structures, but not the chromatophore, are disin-
tegrated to a certain extent and pass into the fluid expressed as suspended
material, which, if kept in this condition for three or four days, partially
dissolves. This forms the thiixl solution. In testing for the occurrence
of oxidising enzymes in these solutions various j-eadily oxidisable reagents
were used as indicators, but the one which gave results most to be relied
upon was guaiacum in absolute alcohol, a drop of which added to a solu-
tion of an oxidising enzyme results in the production of a blue solution in
from a few minutes to half an hour. It was found that an oxidase is
present in solution No. 1 in considerable quantities, but sparingly in No.
2, and it is not demonstrable in No. 3. In the first solution an aero-
oxidasc occurs in small quantities, that is, an oxidase which is active
only in contact with air. Traces of an aiiro-oxidase were found in the

second solution, but ncjt in that obtained with the maximum pressure.

In the last, however, was found abundant evidence of the presence of a
peroxidase, that is, of an oxidase which renders guaiacum solutions
(emulsions) blue only in the presence of liydrogen peroxide. This same
solution also was found to contain a catalase (Loew), that is, a ferment
which liberates oxygen from hydrogen peroxide, but which does not
oxidise guaiacum emulsions. From such experiments it would appear
that the peroxidase and catalase are very intimately associated with the
protoplasmic and nuclear structures of the cell while the oxidase and
aero-oxidase are in media external to the protoplasm. It is important
to note that the chromatophore does not yield an oxidising ferment or

catalase.

    4. On the Jlici-o-chemistri/ of OxypldJe Granules, by Dr. J. J. Mac-

--kenzie. Observations on the eosiiiophilous cells of the bone marrow of

the cat and frog and on the same variety of cells from the ccelomic cavity
of the frog show that although there is obtained in the granules a distinct

iron reaction with ammonium sulphide when the preparation is kept in a

mixture of this reagent and glycerine at a temperature of 5.'J-60° C. for
7 to 10 days the reaction is not nearly so marked as in the nuclear chromatin
of the same cells and is less readily demonstrated. The method in which
acid alcohol is used to liberate the iron from its ' masked ' condition, and
htvmatoxylin to demonstrate the liberated iron, does not reveal the iron
in these granules ; at most with this method one finds a slight reaction in
the perigranular protoplasm, but not in the granules themselves. These
g»ranules give a reaction for phosphorus when they are treated with a

nitric acid solution of ammonium molybdatc for some liours, and sub-
sequently with a solution of phenylhydrazine hydrochloride. The reaction
is much more marked than that in the nuclear chromatin. It is evident

from these oljservations that the substance forming the eosinophilous

granules is a nucleo-proteid containing traces of iron, and that it is

probably a derivative of nuclear chromatin.

   --5. Oii the Micru-chemistry of the Nucleus, by Dr. F. H. Scott. It

was found that the non-chromatiii and non- nucleolar portions of the
nuclei in gland cells which constitute the lanthaniu of Heidenhain and
the ozdematlii of Reinke, though soluljle in gastric juice, give evidence of
the presence of ' masked ' iron and organic phosphorus in small j^rojjor-
tions. Similar evidence was obtained in the case of the non-nucleolar and
non-chromatin portions of the nuclei of nerve-cells. It is probable that
lanthanin or osdematin, while unlike a nucleo-proteid in some respects, is a
closely related compound.

     During the past year the following papers, including observations on
the micro- chemistry of cells made during the last two years, were

                            Summary of Br, Scott's Paper.

     The Nissl granules were found to contain * masked ' iron and organic
phosphorus and to be unaffected by treatment with artificial gastric juice.

They are therefore constituted of a nucleo-proteid in many respects allied

to chromatin. It differs, however, from the nuclear chromatin which is
basophile and from the substance forming the oxyphile centre of the
nucleoli and the material diffused through the nuclear cavity in fully
developed nerve-cells. The latter substance also contains organic phos-
phorus and ' masked ' iron, and is digestible in artificial gastric juice.
These three nucleo-proteids are derived from the original kinetic chromatin
of the neuroblast, and the substance forming the Nissl granules is the only
nucleo-proteid of the three that diffuses from the nucleus. In some forms
this diffusion does not take place in the fully developed cell, or does so

                                                                                                       Gf G

only to a very slight extent. In this case few or no Nissl granules are

found ; a condition which is veiy much like that observed in the not fully

developed nerve-cell, and therefore embryonic. This condition is markedly
illustrated in the nerve-cells in Caudate Amphibia.

                                 Summanj of Professor Macallunis Observations.

In the CyanophyceK the cell, which is non-nucleated, contains two

zones, a central and a peripheral. The latter contains the colouring matter,

and in its vesiculated cytoplasm there is a compound which gives evidence

of containing traces of organic phosphorus and ' masked ' iron. On the

other hand, the central body gives marked reactions for these two elements

which are united in a compound diffused throughout its structure. This

compound stains with lijematoxylin like chromatin, and as it resists disres-

Antion it is probably chromatin.                      iron-holding nucleo-proteid constitutes

the red granules of Btitschli, but it differs from chromatin in that it is

digestible with artificial gastric juice. Another variety of granules,

called ' cyanophycin ' granules, found only in the peripheral layer, are

formed of proteid free from iron and phosphorus. The only substance

in the Cyanophycea; which resembles fully the chromatin of the cells of

higher organisms is that holding iron and phosphorus and diffused in the

central body.

In the yeast all the iron and phosphorus, in addition to being diffused

throughout the cytoplasm, are also localised in small granules and cor-

puscles which have been held to be nuclei and nucleoli by various observers.

The substance which constitutes these and that in which are combined the

iron and phosphorus diffused through the cytoplasm are different from the

chromatin of higher organisms, in that they are soluble in artificial gastric

juice                       but  they are  the  only  chromatiia-like  substances  present  in  the
                         ;

yeast- cell.

     In Beggiatow tlie compounds containing ' masked ' iron and organic
phosphorus are uniformly diffused throughout the cytoplasm, and when

granules which stain with hematoxylin occur they also are found to con-

tain iron and phosphorus in a corresponding form of combination.

Weigert series extending from the fillet decussation to the dorsal cord.

The reason for investigating these regions was to ascertain whether

so-called motor-cells differed from ' sensory ' ones in any definite structural
characteristics. Nothing was discovered by which one kind of cell could

be distinguished from the other, and it has become evident that Nissl's

classification is a purely artificial one. All cells show a distinct fibrilla-

tion, and the basophil ' Nissl-substance ' lying between the bundles of

fibrils.

Motor cells, as a rule, have a greater development of the dendra, and,

in consequence, the fibrils coming from these processes in coursing through

the cell break up the available space in a regular, uniform manner, and

hence there results a more regular arrangement of the basophil granules.

In sensory cells, on the other hand, because of the special development of
one or two dendritic processes one frequently notices on that side of the

nucleus looking towards the biggest dendron a pyramidal (in section tri-

angular) area, occupied by non-differentiated plasm, and formed by the

divergence of the fibrils coming from the big dendron and sweeping round

the nucleus. In these cells, as seen most characteristically in the Locus

cveruleus, Substantia nigra, lateral horns of the spinal cord and the antero-

mesial visceral group of cells, Nissl's granules form relatively coarse aggre-

gations towards one side of the cell. At one time it was thought that a
certain appearance first described by Mann in 1894 ' in the occipital lobe

of the rabbit, since then rediscovered by Roncorini and discredited by

--Levi viz., the presence of crescentic bodies on one side of the nucleus

would allow of a ready distinction between nerve-cells in the cerebrum

and those found in the lower centres. This, hov/ever, was found not to
be the case, for the same appearance is seen throughout the whole length
of the spinal cord right down to the coccygeal portion. The examination

of the dorsal and lower regions of the cord was made possible through the
kindness of Miss M. Purefoy FitzGerald, who placed at our disposal the

complete series of sections she is tabulating at Oxford.

    As to the real existence of these ci'escents there cannot be the slightest
doubt, for Levi's suggestion that we are dealing with a folding of the

nuclear membi'ane is readily disproved by making ti-ansvei'se sections of
the cells in the Cornu Ammonis at right angles to their long axis, and
staining them by Mann's eosin-toluidin-blue method, when these crescents

in question appear one in each nucleus as distinct swellings in the nuclear
membrane, while the latter is not stained at all. In addition to the com-

mon crescentic type one may frequently see in surface views branches

running outwards from the main central portion. The significance of
these figures is probably as follows : F. H. Scott ^ has shown that the
jSTissl's substance is a nucleo-proteid, which .amongst reptiles remains
throughout life intranucle.ar, Ijut which in other vertebrates is found out-
side the nucleus. T.aking these facts into consideration, we .ai'e led to con-
clude that the crescent is a specially modified part of the nuclear membiune
through which normally the nucleo-proteid is passed out into the body of
the nerve-cell. Tliat similar nucleo-proteids do pass out in ordinary
epithelial cells has been ascertained in inflammatory conditions of the
epidermis,- and in gland-cells generally.'^

     On comparing epithelial witli nerve cells we find in both a system of

fibrils which runs right through the cell ; secondly, material secreted by the
nucleus and occupying a position Ijetween the fibrils, and lastly a system of
intracellular lymph channels (Holmgren). During the last year the existence
of these channels in the nerve-cells of the spinal, sympathetic, and central
nervous systems of the rabbit, cat, and monkey has been confirmed by using
erythrosin instead of eosin in conjunction with toluidin-blue. Holmgren
holds that these canals serve to carry a free supply of lymph to the nerve-

cell, while Mann suggests that they are tubes which carry away from the

 cells and towards the fields of conjunction ensymes for tlie elaboration of

the lymph, so as to make the latter directly assimilable by the cell
 processes. Nissl's bodies, then, are zymogen granules secreted by the
 nucleus, stored up during rest, and discharged during activity.'

      Golgi's intracellular network in sj)inal ganglia and the anterior horn

 cells of the spinal cord may he demonstrated by fixing tissue in '2}j per

 cent, potassium iodide saturated with iodine, and then taking them through
 aceton into }3arafiin. The network seems in the spinal ganglia to form a
 framework on which Nissl's substance is deposited. The latter is removed
 by the potassium iodide, while the framework remains.

       Other points Avhich the serial sections have brought out are :

      1. The mesencephalic (so-called descending) root of the fifth nerve
 arises from cells which are quite distinct from the cells of the Lociis
 coer^ilens. Their axis cylinders have very distinct nodes of Ranvier.

      2. The sensory decussation, as shown in the fillet, is only a more pro-
 nounced condition of a general arrangement, holding good for the whole
 length of the cord, the decussating fibres being derived from a small-
 celled nuclevis situated on a level with, and lateral to, the central canal.
 The afferent fibres to it correspond to Pal's dorsal bundle. The two nuclei
 are connected by a commissure of very fine meduUated nerve-fibres run-
 ning dorsally to the well known anterior white commissure.

       .3. Stilling's sacral and cervical nuclei, Clarke's dorsal column, Blu-
 menau's nucleus, Deiter's nucleus, and the cells of the mesencephalic root
 of the fifth nerve seem to belong to the same system, which lies dorso-
 laterally, and is characterised by large cells. The nucleus above referred
 to under No. 2, the gracile and cuneate nuclei proper, the mesial trian-
 gular nucleus of the eighth nerve, and the Loons coernhvs form a dorso-
 mesial system containing small cells.

ON ELECTRICAL CHANGES IN MAMMALIAN NERVE.  455

--Eledriccd Changes in Mammalian Nerue. Report of the Committee,

     consisting of Professor F. Gotch (Chairman), Professor E. H.
     Starling, Dr. J. S, Macdonald (Secretanj). (Braion up hij the

       Secretary.)

The experiments performed witli the assistance of grant from the Asso-

ciation have been directed towards the acquisition of information as to

the effect upon the demarcation current of mammalian nerve of
alterations in resistance, such as are found in mammalian nerve accom-
panying changes of volume and of blood-pi-essure in the vessels supplying
the nerve. The nature of the changes of resistance is easilj' determined
but the effect of such a change in presumably causing not only an altera
tion in the magnitude, but also in the distribution of current and dif-

ferences of potential in the nerve, is not easy to calculate.

     Not only this, but it is impossible even to decide the direction of
change (addition or subtraction) in the demarcation current which would
be produced by any alteration of the internal resistance of the nerve.

     Knowledge of an exact character is required for this purpose, defining
the limits of the demarcation source and the extent to which the source is
short-circuited in the tissues of the nerve itself. It was felt that such
knowledge must be based entirely upon experiments upon nerve, and as
far as possible upon the particular nerve for which the information was

desired.

     With this object a large number of experiments have been performed
upon excised mammalian nerve. The nerves after removal were placed
upon a number of non-polarisable electrodes (four to seven), the potential

differences between each pair of electrodes determined, as also the resist-
ances of the whole nerve and the sections into which it was divided by
the electrodes. The electrode upon which the cross-section lay was then

permanently connected by a wire or through a known resistance to one of

the other electrodes, and the differences of potential between each possible
Dair of electrodes determined again after the formation of this circuit.

    An analysis of the data gained by determination of the various resist-

ances divides the facts of experiments into the following groups :

     (rt) The resistance per centimetre determined from the measurement
of resistance of any given length of the nerve varies with that length,

being smaller for the greater length.

     (b) The resistance of the whole nerve directly determined is a smaller
value than its resistance calculated from a summation of the resistances
of the several sections between pairs of electrodes.

     (c) The resistance of that section of the nerve bounded by the cross-

section gives a smaller value for the resistance per centimetre of the nerve
than any other section.

    An observation of these facts has led to a routine method for calcu-

lating the resistance of any short length of nerve when the resistance

required is not that to a current entering and,leaving at the extremities
of the short length, but the gross longitudinal resistance to a current

travelling in paths parallel to the long axis of the nerve. The resistance
obtp,ined from the longest available stretch of nerve provided with a cross-
                                             .

section at either end and calculated into resistance per centimetre is the

standard of gross longitudinal resistance, and multiplied by the length of

short piece of nerve gives the value required.

The determination of the differences of potential, or, as it is preferred

to call them, the available E.M.F.'s between pairs of points on nerve, and

calculations based upon these and upon the known resistances, have given

interesting information

(«) When the cross-section is connected to a point on the longitudinal

surface, the current found in the outer circuit passing from longitudinal

surface to cross-section can be found traversing the nerve from cross-

section to longitudinal surface, by the new differences of potential acquired

by intervening points on longi-

Atudinal surface of nerve.                       <ral-

vanometer circuit between two

such intervening points shows a

current reverse in direction to

that in the outer circuit, and

the difference of potential be-

tween two such points is exactly

that which would be the case if they are considered simply as points upon

a circuit, the only source of E.M.F. in which is the P.D. between the

extreme points, and with a certain fraction of the total resistance between

them                         which fraction  is  that  given  by  the relation of  the portion of  the
                          ;

gross longitudinal resistance of the nerve between the points to the

resistance of the primary external circuit and the resistance of the nerve
subtended by its points of application.

If there is a pre-existing difference of potential between the two

intervening points (longitudinal current) before the primary external

circuit is formed, this ditierence remains and subtracts from the difference

of potential caused by the closure of this circuit. It is concluded from

this that the soui'ces giving rise to the two phenomena are separate, and

capable of existing simultaneously with an opposition of effects.

     Further, by tracing the differences of potentials round the circuit
formed by permanently joining tlie cross-section to a point on the longi-

tudinal surface it is possible to define the limits of the demarcation

source.

In consequence of the behaviour of points possessing a difference

of potential, the cause of longitudinal currents, an examination has
been made of electrotonic currents, and it is found that quite simi-

larly the closure of a circuit placed for the observation of an electrotonic

current creates differences of potentials in intervening points of nerve due

to a passage in the nerve of a current in the reverse direction, which

reverse current may be observed by connecting up the intervening points

through a galvanometer ; and that in this case also the differences of
potential in intervening points can be calculated from a knowledge of that

portion of the gross longitudinal resistance which lies between them.

   --In all these cases the currents observed demarcation current, longi-
--tudinal current, electrotoiiic current can be demonstrated in this exact

manner to be new creations, the result of the connecting up of the observa-

tion circuit. The institution of the external circuit not only provides for

the first time a current through this external circuit, but also the traverse
of the same current in a return, and therefore reverse, direction through

(6) Experiments have also been performed with reference to the

question of the dependence of the E.M.F. of demarcation source upon tlie

sectional area of the nerve and number of individual tibres contained in it.

It has been found that the laying of two nerves side by side with their

cross-sections upon the same electrode does not increase the available

E.M.F., whilst adding to the current by a diminution of resistance but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

that if one of the nerves is drawn along the other and away from this

electrode, so that the cross-section of one remains upon the electrode, but

that of the other is removed from it, but lies in contact with the longi-

tudinal surface of the first nerve, then there is an increase of the available

E.M.F. This summation of the E.M.F.'s, due to either singly, increases

with the distance between the two cross-sections up to a certain limiting

distance when the maximum summation is reached, It is believed that

from the details of such experiments interesting evidence can be obtained

of the position and limits of the demarcation source and current within

the nerve.

The experiments also provide a considerable amount of evidence as to

the dependence of the available E.M.F. between cross-section and longi-

tudinal surface upon the distance of point on longitudinal surface from

the cross-section. It is believed that the E.M.F, increases up to a certain

point when a maximum is i-eached, and that this maximal value is obtained

until the second cross-section at other end of nerve is approached.

It is also believed that a similar law is true for longitudinal currents,

as also for electrotonic currents, namely, that with the proximal electrode

upon a fixed point the removal of the distal electrode further and further

from this point produces the same kind of variation.

In addition it is reported that in reference to the further error to which

it was conceived the variations -of blood-pressure in the blood-vessels of a

--mammalian nerve might give rise namely, to electromotive phenomena

--similar to those recorded in case of the carotid and femoral arteries

number of experiments have been conducted to decide the causation of

this phenomenon. It was considered for purposes of further experiment

that its causation might be due to (1) changes in the muscular walls of

arteries                            (2) variations  in  a  conceivable  current  due  to  frictional  How
                                 ;

through the peripheral vessels.

Experiments carried out upon these two lines have produced some

evidence in support of (1), but none in support of (2). In case of the

latter supposition the perfusion of saline solution through excised organs

under varying pressure was not found to be productive of any current

changes other than such as might be explained by changes of resistance

&c., which were also measured.

quantity, in the urine. Tlie full results are not, however, ready for

publication.

      In the second class of experiment, an animal was brought into nitro-
genous equilibrium and the substance administered, either by addition to
the diet or by subcutaneous injection.

     These latter experiments are of necessity very laborious, and slow in
yielding results. They are, moreover, only in their commencement.
Nevertheless, very interesting facts promise to arise out of them. For
example, a pronounced form of glycosuria seems to be caused by the
subcutaneous injection of arginin. The work has, however, not yet been
controlled, and it would obviously be premature to go further into the

facts.

     Hithei'to, the necessary arginin and lysin have been generously placed

at my disposal by Professor A. Kossel, of Maiburg. These substances

are, however, very expensive to produce, and it can hardly be hoped that
a sufficient supply will in future be available from this source. The
experiments are also in themselves more costly than those of former
years. For these reasons, as well as on account of the important results
which they promise to yield, it is deemed necessary to apply for an

increased grant, viz., of 40^.

     The secretary has been responsible for the carrying out of the work.

--Vascular Snpply of Secreting Glands. Beport of the Committee, con-

     sisting of Professor E. H. Starling {Chairman), Dr. J. L.
     Bunch (Secretary), and Dr. L. E. Shore, on the Effect of
      Chorda, Stimulaiion on the Volume of the Sitlmaxilla.ry Gland.
     (Bravm up bi/ the Secretary.)

Changes in volume of the submaxillary gland may be brought about

both by variations in the flow of blood to the gland and of secretion from
the gland. Not so long ago it was believed that a distinct causal relation-
ship existed between vascular supply and secretion ; that fluid was
secreted from the gland as a result of increased intracapillary pressure,
and the discovery by Claude Bernard of the vaso dilator action of the

-- --chorda tympani the chief secretory nerve then known lent additional

weight to this theory. But the theory was disproved by Ludwig, who
showed that the dog's submaxillaiy could be made to secrete by stimulation

of the cervical sympathetic nerve, though such stimulation caused vaso-
constriction and not vaso-dilatation, and that the pressure in the gland
duct could exceed the pressure even in the carotid artery. Other facts
were discovered, such as the paralysis of the secretory fibres of the
ON THE VASCULAR SUPPLY OF SECRETING GLANDS.  459

chorda by atropine, although the vaso-dilator hbr'es of the nerve remained
unaffected, and the secretion which can be obtained as a result of chorda
stimulation unaccompanied by vaso-motor changes after degeneration of
the nerve for two or three days.

     It cannot, however, be said that the problem of secretion has lost its

complexity even now, for we know that secretion may be accompanied by
\ aso-eonstriction or by vaso-dilatation ; that it may in .some cases bo

paralysed by quinine or atropine, in others not ; and that in the same

gland stimulation of one nerve may give rise to a secretion having quite

different characteristics from that brought about by excitation of another

nerve.

     In order to investigate the action of the chorda on the volume of the
submaxillary gland I have employed a plethysmograph of very simple
construction, devised by Professor 8chafer, which consists of a gutta-
percha box with one side of glass, thus enabling the gland to be kept
directly under observation, and any flushing or pallor of the superficial
vessels to be accurately noted. The vessels and gland-duct enter the box
on one side through an opening sufficiently large to prevent any pressure
being exerted upon them, and the rest of the aperture is closed by cotton-
wool and thick vaseline. Only a very small portion of the duct where it
emerges from the hilum is contained within the plethysmograph, and the
box is so supported by means of a clamp that the portion of duct outside
it is quite loose, and no contraction of the longitudinal fibres of the duct
can pull upon or otherwise affect the volume of the contents of tlie box.
The 1)ox is connected with a tambour or piston-recorder, which writes on
a smoked paper, by an indiarubber tube attached to a glass tube which
passes through one side of the box, the whole apparatus being filled with

Aair. lateral tube leads from this connecting tube, and is closed with a

spring clip, so that the pressure within this air-tight system can be raised

or lowered at any moment. The tracings obtained in many cases show

most distinctly both heart-beats and respii-atory curves.
     The chorda was exposed after division of the digastric muscle, ligatured,

and cut, and the peripheral end stimulated by means of Ludwig's elec-
trodes, which were left in situ. In some cases, tlie chordo-lingual nerve
was divided centrally and the peripheral end stimulated ; any injury to
the more slender chorda through manipulation was thus avoided. The
nerve was excited by currents of different strengths, and with varying rates
of repetition of this stimulus, and the anaesthetic was varied in different
experiments. With a moderately weak stimulus excitation of the chorda pro-
duced considerable diminution in volume of the gland and a fall of the lever
of the piston-recorder. The fall was preceded by a short latent period when

the gland was secreting freely, and rapidly reached its maximum when
the stimulation was a short one. When the current was shut off the

lever still remained at its lowest point for a short time, which varied in
duration according to the length of passage of the current. The gland
then very gradually again increased in volume, and the lever rose until it
once more reached the base-line. This recovery in volume was succeeded
liy dilatation of the gland and further rise of the lever to a point well
above the base-line, after which it again gradually fell. The extent of
this dilatation varied according to the previous diminution in volume of

the gland, being greater and more prolonged when the diminution of
gland volume had been well marked, but the after-rise of the lever did

 not equal in extent or duration its previous fall. This diminution in
460 REPORT--1900.

gland volume was accompanied by a free flow of secretion from the duct,
the amount of which was measured, and by marked dilatation of the

^'essels of the gland.

     With a stronger stimulus the latent period was shorter, the flow of
saliva greater, and the diminution in volume of the gland more abrupt
and of greater range. The recovery of volume was also slower, and the

after dilatation more marked. When the excitation was a long one, more

especially with a strong current, the recovery of the gland was consider-

ably prolonged, and the rise of the lever a very gradual one. As long as

both gland and nerve remained in good condition successive stimulations
of the chorda repeated as soon as the gland had returned to its original
volume still continued to produce the same effect, with but little difference
in diminution of volume in response to stimuli of the same strength and
duration. If, however, the nerve was stimulated a second time, either
immediately after the first excitation or while the lever was still rising,
the resulting diminution in volume of the gland was less than that pre-
ceding it, this difference being greater the more quickly the second

excitation succeeded the first. When the secretion produced by chorda

stimulation was scanty and viscid, in spite of the accompanying active
vaso-dilatation, stimulation of the nerve caused either a very small fall
of the lever or a preli)ninary fall succeeded by a rise. In some cases,
more especially when there was some obstruction to the free escape of
blood through the veins, and also scanty secretion, chorda excitation gave
rise to increase of volume of the gland, owing to the increased flow of
blood to the gland more than compensating for the small amount of
secretion leaving it. After the administration of small doses of atropine
intravenously, sufficient to paralyse the secretory fibres of the chorda
(8-12 mg. for a dog of 7 kilos.), stimulation of the peripheral end of the
divided chorda caused no flow of secretion from the duct, Ijut an active
dilatation of the gland and a rise of the piston-recorder lever to an extent
about equal to the previous fall of the same lever brought about by a
stimulus of the same strength and duration before any atropine had been

administered.

     The absolute increase or diminution in the volume of the gland under
various conditions was estimated by calibration of the piston-recorder,

the rise or fall of the lever for fractional parts of a cubic centimetre

being marked out on a scale. The volume of the gland in cubic centi-
metres was determined from the diff'erenoe between its weiglit in air and
in water, and the amount of secretion produced by nerve stimulation or
otherwise was also determined by connecting the cannula in the duct with
a glass tube graduated in fractional parts of a c.c. In order to determine
the total diminution in volume of the gland, due to chorda stimulation,
the diminution in volume of the gland was first detei'mined in an etherised
dog before the administration of atropine, and then the increase in
volume of the same gland after the administration of a dose of atropine
sufficient to paralyse the secretory fibres of the chorda. By adding the
two amounts together the total loss of gland contents due to chorda

stimulation was obtained. On comparing this with the amount of secre-
tion poured out in the same time we found that at least -,"^ of the

seci-etion was derived from the extra-vascular portions of the gland.
Since there is no diminution in the lymph flow from the gland, but rather
a slight increase during the period of stimulation (Bainbridge), we must
conclude tli^t the effect of the secretory nerves is simply and solely upon the

socretory cells, the increased exudation from the blood-vessels which must

in the last instance supply the fluid for the secretion being a secondary

phenomenon determined entirely by the metabolic thanges of the cells, and

lagging behind these to a veiy considerable extent.

The Committee, acting in conjunction with the Childhood Society for

the Scientific Study of the Mental and Physical Conditions of Children,
have, through the assistance of that society, been able to use the cards
recording the 'cases with any abnormal nerve-sign,' as seen 1892-94;
that is, 2,851 boys, 2,003 girls, as found among 26,287 boys, 23,713 girls

examined.

As. a new method of research these cases are arranged in primary

groups containing the children who presented nerve-signs in (1) the face

only                   (2) the           hand  only                   (3)  eye-movements  defective  only ;                                                   and (4)  a

group showing nerve-signs in other parts of the body only.

In making a rapid examination and report on children examined in

schools, it may be convenient to classify nerve-cases in four groups as

presenting signs in (1) face (defect of expression, overaction of the frontal

muscles, knitting the eyebrows, muscular relaxation about the lower

eyelid)                             (2)  in  balance  of              the  hand  or  finger twitches                                                     (3)  irregular
                                 ;                                                                                                                    ;

of the body. Twenty-one nerve-signs have been observed and defined ; ^
the cases presenting these signs are here grouped in classes under the
headings named according to the parts of the body in which they are seen.

     The tables given in the appendix may now be described.
     The total number of children with any class of nerve-signs is obtain-

able by adding the eight primary groups presenting that class, thus :

Among the children 7 years and under, adding the eight lines enumerating

signs in the face gives a total of 343 boys, 179 girls. Again, addition
of the three lines enumerating signs in face and cyo- movements gives a
total of 21 boys, 20 girls, with the two classes of nerve-signs.

     The numbers in each primary group of nerve-cases are given in the
last column of the table, and are distributed again as primary groups
according to the main classes of defect observed associated with the

                     Thus :

    Column headed B gives cases with nerve-signs only.

   AB= Nerve-signs associated with development defect only.

      BC=]Srerve-signs associated with delicacy only ; children pale or thin.

   BD= Nerve-signs with mental dulness only.

   ABC = Nerve-cases with develoj^mental defect and delicate only, i.e.

not dull or backward.

    From these tables the compound groups am be formed by addition of

the primary groups composing them, and from these the correlations of
the classes of nerve-signs with the main classes of defect can be obtained
after the method explained in Dr. Warner's paper, published in the
'Journal of the Royal Statistical Society,' March 189G.

    Among the nerve-cases here reported on, the relative frequency of

nerve-signs in the face, the hand, and in eye-movements is shown to be

as follows :

--Silchester Excavation. Eeport of the Committee, consisting of Mr.

     Arthur J. Evans (Chairman), Mr. J. L. Myres {Secretary),

    and Mr. E. W. Brabrook, appointed to co-operate with the Sil-

     chester Excavation Fund Committee in their Excavations.
The Committee has to report that the excavations at Silchester in 1899
were begun on May 5, and continued, with the usual break durin the

harvest, until November 16.
     The examination of the south-west quarter of the town having been

completed in 1898, it was resolved to continue the excavation of the
northern half of the site. To suit the convenience of the tenant, the
operations of 1899 were restricted to the insula (XXI) east of insula I
                        ON SILCHESTER EXCAVATION.         467

(which was excavated in 1890-1), and to another insula (XXII) north of

XXI, extending nearly as far as the town wall. The total area examined

was about 5^ acres. The block plan shows the parts already excavated in

shaded tint.

XXIInmda      appears to have been enclosed by walls on all four sides.

In addition to two houses occupying the northern corners, it had on its

eastern side a large house of the courtyard type, with another small house

to the south of it. At the south-east angle of the insula was situated an

oblong chamber with an apsidal end, perhaps the meeting room of some

trade guild. Other traces of buildings were found along the south side.

The south-west angle unfortunately underlies the modern roadway through

the city, and could only partly be examined. The western side contained

two small square structui'es. With regard to the houses, that at the

north-west corner was discovered in 1864 by the Rev. J. G. Joyce, who

communicated an account of it to Archceologia. It was, however, only

partly excavated by him, and additional chambers have now been found

on the south and east. The north-east house is one of the corridor type

that has become a courtyard house by later additions. In one of the

added rooms was a hypocaust of peculiar plan. The large house on the

east side is of interest from the several changes it has undergone, as well

as on account of the traces of a series of mosaic pavements of simple

character. The small house to the south is remarkable for the number of

pits and wells found beneath it. From these were extracted several whole

vases, some of an early type and excellent design.

Instda XXII, tliough equal in size to the other, contained a large

amount of open ground in the centre and north-west. As there were no

.signs of a street on its eastern side, the portion excavated may form part

of a larger inaiila. Near the south-west angle was a good-sized house of

the corridor type, with a large chamber at one end terminating in an apse,

Awhich had a hypocaust beneath it.  square chamber of some size which

had been added on one side has foundations of huge blocks of ironstone,

and the same material has been used in what appears to have been a re-

construction of the western part of the house. Besides this house, por-

tions of three others were found. Two of these were of very little interest.

The remains of the third inckide a square block subdivided into two

chambers of unequal size, with an apse attached to one side All these

had been warmed by hypocausts.

    As usual, a number of wells were met with, lined with wooden framing

towards the bottom. No architectui-al remains of any importance were

met with, save a piece of coping, part of a fluted Purbeck marble pilaster,

and a fragment of a white marble slab. The finds in bronze, iron, glass,

and bone were as numerous as usual, but do not call for special notice.
From the pits examined an exceptionally large number of entire vessels of

pottery were recovered, the total being about eighty. They include scA'eral

p.seudo-8amian vases of unusual quality, an inscribed drinking cup of

Castor ware, some large vessels of the coarse ware which is so seldom

found entire, &,c., etc. The coins found were not very numerous.

   A detailed account of all the discoveries was laid before the Society of

Antiquaries on May 3, 1900, and will be published in ^lrc/u«;o%irt, LVII.

A special exhibition of the antiquities, &,c., found, was held, as in former

years, at Burlington House.
     The statement of accounts for the year 1899 shows a total expendi-

tui-e of 515^. Os. 7d.

The work of the past year has furnished conspicuous evidence of the

great importance of securing ethnological data with as little delay as
possible. While this is eminently true with respect to the white popula-

tion, which is experiencing new and marked changes almost every year, in

consequence of the introduction of foreign elements, often in large
numbers, it is more particularly true with respect to the native Indian

population. In many localities the original blood has become so diluted
by intermarriage with whites that it is often a matter of great difficulty

to find an Indian of pure blood. Proximity to settlements of white
people has resulted in a more or less profound impress upon the social
life and tribal customs, which are fast becoming obsolete and forgotten.

The old chiefs who have served as the repertories of traditionary know-
ledgo are rapidly passing away, and with their death there disappears

the last possibility of securing reliable data of the greatest value. Con-
spicuous instances of this kind have been brought to notice during the
jjast year, especially in the case of the British Columbia Indians, whose
ethnology is of the greatest interest and importance in consequence of

their possible connection with the people of Eastern Asia. At present

the great difficulty of securing competent and willing investigators is one
of the most serious obstacles to be contended with, and it is believed that
the often considerable expense involved in the prosecution of such work

is largely accountable for this condition of affairs.

     It is gratifying to note that the Department of Education for Ontario
has lately taken a very practical and active interest in ethnological studies
in that province, and that it provides for the publication of the results of
research in its annual reports. During the past year Mr. A. F. Hunter,

resume of this work shows that much light has been thrown upon the

extent, characteristics, and condition of the Indian population in prehistoric
times. Evidence has latterly been accumulating to indicate the presence
at one time of numerous aboriginal settlements in localities which were

very sparsely inhabited when first visited by the white explorers. One of

the most fruitful fields in Ontario for the archaeologist is afforded by the

sites of the numerous Indian villages which abound in the northern

portions of Simcoe County, more especially in the townsliips of Tiny and
ATay.
       very interesting report on the subject was issued last year by

Mr. Andrew F. Hunter, M.A., relating to the Huron Indian relics found

in the former township, which has just been supplemented by a similar

publication in regard to the discoveries in the adjoining municipality of

ATay, both being issued as appendices to the Educational Report.

special interest attaches to the investigations made in Tiny, as it includes

the spot where Champlain and the early missionaries landed on their

arrival in the Huron country, the researches of Mr. Hunter being carried

on with a view to the identification of those villages described by these

pioneers of civilisation and Christianity. In the territory identified as

occupied by the Bear nation, belonging to the Huron confederacy, which

embraces Tiny and a portion of Tay township, there were no fewer than

forty-nine villages, and twenty-four bone -pits or aboriginal burying-

places, have been unearthed. The villages, however, were not all occu-

pied at the same time. Thirty-nine of the number bear evidences that

Athe inhabitants had had some contact with Europeans.  detailed

description is given of the various village sites and bone-pits, and the

more interesting and valuable of the relics discovered, with numerous
Aillustrations.
                 site to which particular importance attaches is the ruins

of the second fortified Jesuit mission of St. Marie, on Christian Island,

with the remains of an extensive Huron village surrounding it. The

population is estimated to have been from 6,000 to 8,000 in the winter of

1649-50, when it was decimated by famine and disease.

' Considerable difi'erence of opinion has prevailed as to the spot where

the early missionaries Brebeuf and Lallemant were tortured and burned

by the Iroquois during the war which almost exterminated the Hurons,

and those interested will find many facts bearing upon the controversy in

the report dealing with the township of Tay. Mr. Hunter's own view,

after a painstaking survey of all the evidence obtainable, is that the site

of St. Louis II., where the missionaries were captured when the village

was burned, is on the farm of John McDermitt, lot 15, concession IV.,
where extensive ash-beds have been found mixed with relics. The identity

of the village appears to be established by its size, as indicated by the

ground, and its location as described by the old writers. Mr. Hunter is

inclined to regard the site on the farm of Charles E. Newton, lot 11,

concession YL, as that of St. Ignace II., the village to which the captured

priests were taken, and where their martyrdom, so powerfully described

by Parkman, took place. It has been known locally as the " Jesuits'
Field" for many years, and there are the usual traditions of buried

treasure which gain currency wherever relics of the past are brought to

light. Much interesting information with regard to less notable sites and

the frequent discoveries of Indian remains throughout the township are

also embodied in this work.'

     In Appendix I. Mr. B. Suite continues his study of the early

French settlers in Canada, covering the period 1632-66. He traces the

origin of these immigrants from different parts of Fi-ance, and it thus
becomes possible to establish with great accuracy the relative importance

ing generations.

     In Appendix II. Mr. Hill-Tout follows up his very careful study of
the N'tlaka'pamuQ, appended to last year's report, with a similar close
investigation of another and markedly different division of the Salish
stock in British Columbia, the Sk-go'mic. These people previously in-

habited Howe Sound and Burrard Inlet in large numbers, but they are
now much reduced, and appear to be rapidly passing away. Over ninety
villages at one time inhabited are enumerated. Much attention has been

given to the language, which had not heretofore been seriously investi-
gated, and which shows numerous grammatical and other peculiarities.
Mr. Hill-Tout's work, in fact, constitutes a very important local contribu-
tion to the ethnology of the native races of the west coast.

     This report is accompanied by nineteen photographs of Indians, taken
by Mr. Hill-Tout, partly of the Sk-go'mic and partly of neighbouring
tribes, in which he is now further pursuing his investigations.

     The ancient settlement of Huron Indians at Lorette, near Quebec,

has always been an object of great interest to the ethnologist, although
prolonged and intimate contact with the whites of the neighbourhood
has resulted in marked alterations of a physical and social character.
These alterations have progressed so far as to make trustworthy studies
an exceptionally difficult matter, but the Committee felt that no oppor-
tunity to secure such data as might yet be available should be lost, and
in Appendix III. Mr. L. Gerin presents the results of a very careful

investigation into the actual social condition of these Indians. He

brings this into comparison with their original condition, tracing out

the influences which have produced great changes among them during

their prolonged residence in the province of Quebec, subsequent to the

abandonment of their old home. The condition of this community of
Hurons offers a marked contrast to that of the originally similar Iroquois
community near Montreal, their evolution in modern times having been
almost in opposite directions ; a circumstance explained by their environ-
ment in the two cases. The report is accompanied by photographs
showing the present conditions of village life, which will be kept on file

for future reference.

                                 APPENDIX I.

              Early French Settlers in Canada. By B. Sulte.

    Following my statement of last year, I beg to submit, first, the result
of my observations respecting the number of actual settlers in 1632-66.

     In 1632 there were twenty-nine men ' in the colony, who were either

married or who married soon after, and became heads of families. These

Aare the roots of the Canadian tree.        few Frenchmen engaged in the fur

trade formed a distinct group outside of the scope of this paper.

     In 1640 the ' habitants ' numbered 375,' distributed as follows :

     Married men, 64 ; married women (three born in Canada), 64 ; widower,

1;   widows,     4;  unmarried men,  35 ;   boys (30 born  in Canada),   58             girls
                                                                                     ;

(24  born    in  Canada),  48 ;  nuns, 6 ;  Jesuits, 29 ;  other  Frenchmen, 66
                                                                                                                          ;

iotal, 375.

              ' I have published a biographical sketch of each of them.
                 ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                              471

    According to my calculations, the ' habitants ' did not exceed 600 in

1650, besides 40 Jesuits, 40 Jesuits' servants, and 20 other Frenchmen.
     The population in 1653 appears to have been distributed in threo

groups : Quebec, 400 ; Three Rivers, 175 ; Montreal, 100 ; total, 675.

   We must add the usual contingent of French traders, which was very

small at that time on account of the war of the Iroquois.
      It is mentioned in letters dated from Canada, 1661-63, that the entire

population (inhabitants, Jesuits, and others) did not exceed 2,500. This

embraces the large immigrations of 1662, 1663, which mark a new de-

parture in the whole affairs of Canada.
     The reader is referred to the statement in the last Report, covering the

period of 1608-1645, with regard to the origin of the 122 men who first
settled in the colony. I will now show the origin of 475 more during
1646-166G. These are men who came from France, were already married

or married in Canada, and founded families in the colony :

Nnrth-vxst nf i^ra)ic^.--Bretagne, 20 ; Maine, 22 ;           Normandie, 136
                                                                                                                                   ;

Picardie,  10 ;  Ile-de-France,  25 ;  Touraine,  8;  Anjou,  IS            total,  239.
                                                                         ;

total 2 1 2.

     East o/ France.--Champagne, 6 ; Nivernais, 2 ; Berry, 3 ; Dauphine,

4 ; Auvergne, 5 ; Lyonnais, 4 ; total, 24.

     During the same period, 1646-1666, I lind 100 marriages without any

mention of the origin of the contracting parties ; but we may safely infer,

from the synopsis just given, that they must be added to the 475 whose
origins are known, and distributed according to the relative proportions

of that statistic.

    Therefore from 1608 to 1666 we have examined 697 men who came

from France with their wives, or marrying once settled in the colony.
     Until about 1645 the greatest number of them came from the north of

river Loire ; after that the south-western provinces gradually balanced

the emigration from the north

1646-1666. North of Loire, 231 ; south of Loire, 220.

    Immigrants from Touraine, Poitou, Rochelle, Aunis, Saintonge, An-
goumois, Bordeaux, found their way to Canada after 1650, so that the
Normandy influence was absolute until about 1660, when Poitou and

Rochelle came in for a large share.

The first official census was taken in 1666, and considered imperfect at

Newthat time. It gives 3,215 souls for all the        France.

The census (nominal) of 1667 says 3,918 souls. These last figures

represent the 697 heads of families above mentioned. The following

statement is a resume of that valuable document :

Families, 668 ; males, 2,406 ; females, 1,512 ;       married (625),                1,250
                                                                                                            ]

strong and populous tribe, numbering, when white men first carae^ into

contact with them, many thousands. Some of their larger o'laimmitq, or

villages, contained as many as seven hundred people, and that less than

Wefifty years ago.  gather this from the early white settlers themselves.

The original home and territory of the Sk-qo'mic seems to have been

on the banks of the river which gives them their tribal name, and

along the shores of Howe Sound, into which the Skuamish runs. Their

settlements on the river extended for upwards of thirty miles along the

banks. Their northern neighbours were the Lillooets or Stktlumn tribe

and the Tcilkotin division of the Dene stock. Their southern neighbours

were the Lower Fraser tribes. According to one of my informants the

Indian villages that used to exist on English Bay, Burrard Inlet, and

False Creek were not originally true Sk-qo'mic. They were said to be
Howallied by speech and blood to the Lower Fraser tribes.
                                                           far this is

correct seems impossible now to say. SkqO'raic is everywhere spoken

throughout this territory, and has been as far back as our knowledge of it

goes ; and the Sk-qo'mic villages, according to my informants, extend to

and include Ma'li, at the mouth of the Fraser, which place Dr. Boas was

informed by the River Indians belonged to them, and which he has

accordingly included in their teiritory. It was probably the dividing

line, and, like Spuzzum, farther up the river, was composed partly of the

one division and partly of the other.

     Our first knowledge of the Sk-qo'mic dates back to rather less than a

century ago. The first white man to sail into English Bay and Howe
Sound and come into contact with them was Captain Vancouver. He

recorded briefly his impressions of them in the diary of his voyage to this

coast, a short extract from which may be of interest in this first formal

account of the tribe. He writes thus :

                                                                                             Friday, June 15, 1792.'

     ' But for this circumstance we might too hastily have concluded that
this part of the Gulf was uninhabited. In the morning we were visited
by nearly forty of the natives, on whose approach from the very material
alteration that had now taken place in the face of the country we
expected to find some difterence in their general character. This conjec-

ture was, however, premature, as they varied in no respect whatever, but
in possessing a more ardent desire for commercial transactions, into the
spirit of which they entered with infinitely more avidity than any of our

former acquaintances, not only bartering amongst themselves the diflerent
valuables they had obtained from us, but when that trade became slack
in exchanging those articles again with our people, in which traSic they
always took care to gain some advantage, and would frequently exult on

this occasion. Some fish, their garments, spears, bows and arrows, to

which these people wisely added their copper garments, comprised their
general stock-in-trade. Iron in all forms they judiciously preferred to any

other article we had to ofier.'

     They have not altered much in these points of their character .since
Vancouver's visit, and many of them have to-day, I am told, snug little
sums judiciously invested by their good friend and spiritual director, the

late Bishop Durieu, in safe paying concerns. It is only fair to say, how-
ever, that they deserve to be prosperous. They are probably the most

great credit upon the Roman Mission established in their midst.

      I obtained the following list of old village sites, not 10 per cent, of

which are now inhabited. The list is not perfectly complete. There

were a few more villages at the upper end of Burrard Inlet which have

been long abandoned, and whose names my informants could not recall.

My enumeration contains in all some ninety-three villages, each of

which, according to Chief Thomas of Qe'qlOs and others, was formerly a

                                                   Social Organimtion,

    The social organisation of the Sk-qo'mic lias lieen so much broken up
and modified by missionary and white influence that it is difficult now
to learn any details about it. The tribe appears to have been divided,
like the N'tlaka'pamuQ, into a number of ukivmHuq, or village communi-
ties, each of which was governed by its own local chief. I could gather

nothing of their beliefs with regard to the origin of their different villages :
they seem to have none or else to have lost or forgotten them. Of the
origin of the tribe as a whole and some of the chief events of their

existence I gathered an account a few years ago from an ancient member
of the tribe, who was born a year or so after Captain Vancouver's visit

mto them 1792. This was published in the ' Proceedings of the Royal

Society of Canada,' 1897-98. Briefly it tells how the first Sk-qo'mic man
came into existence ; how later the tribe was overwhelmed by a flood,
and only one man and his wife escaped in their canoe, which landed on
the mountains contiguous to the present Sk-qo'mic territory ; and how

later again a severe and prolonged snowstorm caused, by cold and famine,

the death of the whole tribe save one man and his daughter. From these

two the Sk-qo'mic trace their tribal descent.

      The people were divided into the usual threefold division of chiefs,
nobles, and common people. The lines, however, between the.se classes

were not absolutely rigid. According to my informants a member of the

lower class, if a woman, could rise to the class above her by marriage
with a member of that class, the wife usually taking the rank of her

husband if not a slave. But a man of the lower rank, even if he suc-
ceeded in marrying a woman of the middle class, could only become a
 member of that class by undergoing a long and severe training, in which

 daily washings and scrubbings of the body played an important part.
 This was evidently a form of initiation the further particulars of which

 I could not learn. As a rule the chiefs and their families and immediate
 relatives formed a class or caste apart, the title of chief or headman
 descending from father to son, patriarchate prevailing among the

 Sk-qo'mic. Consequently a chief usually married a chief's daughter or

 daughters. But this rule was sometimes broken, and a woman of a lower

 class was taken to wife. In these cases the chieftainship would properly

 descend to one of the chief's brothers or his son, and not to his own son.
 This was the rule. But it was possible to bi-eak this also and transmit
 the headship of the tribe to his own son by giving many ' potlatch ' feasts,
                         --

and thus securing the goodwill of tlie tribe in his son's favour, The son,
too, upon his father's death, would also give a feast and make handsome
presents to all the influential men of the tribe, the result of which would
be that he would be elected to the rank of chief, and be allowed to succeed
his father in the chieftaincy of the tribe. From this it would seem that
children took their social rank from their mother rather than from their
father, which looks like a trace of matriarchate, or mother-riglit. It is
clear from their folk-tales, however, that these class divisions were not
hard and fast, but that members of a lower caste could by the per-
formance of certain acts pass into that above it. Of seci'et societies I
was unable to obtain any information whatever, and whether such

formerly existed among the Sk-qo'mic-- of which I am extremely doubtful
it seems impossible now to say. Among the chiefs there were some of
higher rank than the others, as among the N'tlaka'pamuQ. The supreme
sul'm of the tribe was known by the title Te K'laplla'ndii, and had his
headquarters at the mouth of the Hom'ultcison Creek, now called Capilano
by the whites. He was local chief also of the Homu'ltcison sept. Next
in rank to him came one of the Skuamish River chiefs. He likewise had
a proper title, being known a,s Te Qutsila'noQ.^ I was unable to learn
what special signification these titles liad. It is possible we may see in

them the special names of two powerful gentes. The gentile system of
the Sk-qo'mic, if such existed, is not at all clear. The distinction between
what might be regarded as a gens, or a sept, or a mere tribal division is

very difficult to determine.

    I could gather nothing satisfactory from any of my informants on this

head. Heraldic and totemic symbols, according to .some of them, were
never used in the old days ; but yet I was informed by others that some
of the old houses had carved posts or columns, and that the figure of a
bird or some otlier animal would sometimes be placed on a pole in front

of the house or fastened to one of the gable ends. They also, sometimes

at least, used masks in certain of their dances, if we may rely upon the
information on these points in their folk-tales. The tribe, as my ethno-
graphical notes show, was formerly divided into a number of subdivisions,
or d'kwumuq. Whether each of these should be regarded simply as a
tribal subdivision, as among the N'tlaka'pamuQ, or as a gens, as among
the nortliern tribes, is doubtful. Each division had its own proper name
in every instance, I think, a geographical one-- derived from some local

physical peculiarity, exactly as among the N'tlaka'pamuQ. In every
ukinimnq there existed the same threefold division of the people into

three classes, and in some instances the total number of souls in each
village would amount to several hundreds. Generally speaking, each
community would be made up of several families or clans. The members

of these clans were not bound together, as the gentes of the northern

     ' The distinctive part of this title bears a remarkable resemblance to the esoteric
term by which one of the Nootka deities was invoked by the chiefs of that tribe.
Dr. Boas has recorded the name of this being under the form Ka'tse. The two forms
so clearly resemble each other as to suggest some connection between them ; and

in this connection I may remark that the more I extend my studies of the Salish
and Kwakiutl-Nootka, the stronger is the conviction forced upon me that between

these two stocks there is a deeper underlying racial connection than the structural
differences of their language would seem to indicate. Morphologically speaking,

they seem to Lave little in common ; but that little steadily increases with our larger

analytical knowledge of their languages, and their vocabulary reseciblances are
pir^ny and f.?r-rcaching.

tribes, by common totems or crests. They comprised the blood relatives

of any given family on both sides of the house for six generations.
After the sixth generation the kinship ceases to hold good and the

clanship is broken. Under this arrangement an individual's relatives

were legion, and he would often have family connection in a score or

more different okwiunuq. Among the present Sk-qo'mic almost all of

them are related in this way to one another, and their cousinships are

endless and. even perplexing to themselves. Marriage within the family
or clan as thus constituted was prohibited, but members of different clans

in the same village could intermarry with each other. If each village

community is to be regarded as a separate gens having a common origin

-- --from some common ancestor which I think is extremely doubtful tlien

marriage among the Sk'qo'mic was not forbidden to members of the same

gens. For my own part I am disposed to regard these separate communi-

ties as mere subdivisions of the tribe which were effected at different
periods in their tribal existence, and generally, probably, from the same

causes which have all over the world led to the founding of new homes
and new settlements, viz., increase andsti-ess of population. The evidence

in favour of regarding these divisions as distinct gentes having each a

sepa.rate origin and soringing from a separate ancestor, as among the
northern tribes, is scanty and doubtful. This view is strengthened by
the traditional origin of the tribe, which makes them all spring from a

common pair. I do not desire to be understood as asserting that totemic

agentes did not formerly exist among the Sk-qo'mic, as Dr. Boas seems to

hold. All I say is that after diligent inquiry from several of the chiefs

and others I could myself find no evidence of it. I could not learn that

any particular group or family bore names peculiar to that group or
family, or possessed privileges not shared by the others other than the
right to certain dances and their accompanying songs the origin and

source of which was some personal dream, or vision, or experience of their

own or their parents. But the ownership of these dances differed in no
way from the ownership of a canoe or any other piece of property, and
constituted no kind of bond or union between the owner of them and

others of the tribe or ukwumuq.

The only peculiar name that I could learn other than those of the

supreme chiefs was that borne by the offspring of female slaves by their

masters. This was the term std'cE-m, and was a word of reproach.

Polygamy was commonly practised among the Sk-qo'mic, the number
Aof a man's wives being limited only by his rank and wealth.
                                                                  chief

would frequently have four or five wives. Each wife had her own

Aquai-ters in the house, which included a fire and a bed of her own.

favourite wife would rank first. She would be regarded in consequence
with jealousy and hatred by the others. The husband would sometimes
eat with one, sometimes with another. Infidelity in wives was punished
by cutting the soles of their feet, or, in some instances, by stoning them

to death.

                                               Moiiuary Customs.

    The burial custoii'is of the modern Sk-qo'mic are now commonly con-
ducted in the same way as our own, few, if any, of the older ceremonies,

--·which are discountenanced by the priests, being observed. In former

days the following customs were universally practised : "When life had
left the body the corpse was taken out of the house and washed by some

elderly friends of the family. It was then doubled up and placed In a

box coffin before it had grown rigid. In the case of chiefs the body was

sometimes placed in a canoe instead of a box. It was then taken to the

burial-ground whether it were day or night. If it were night-time

torches would be used. The box containing the corpse was then placed

in a roughly constructed cedar-slab shed, after which everybody returned

home. The immediate relatives of the deceased followed the corpse,

accompanied by the other members of the family or clan, together with

Vhoall their friends, and a band of special mourners,  are engaged for the

occasion. All those who followed the corpse to the graveyard must

paint the breasts of their garments with red paint. If this were not

done a scarcity of fish would be the result at the next salmon run. The

moui-ners are of both sexes, and all cry aloud. The period of mourning

lasted generally about a month. If, however, the deceased were very

dear to the survivors, the mourning would be kept up longer. When a

chief died the whole community turned out to mourn, and almost every-

body followed the corpse. The hired mourners are paid for their services

with blankets or skins. If the friends of the deceased are wealthy a

feast is held immediately after the disposal of the body, and the mourners

are then paid. If, however, the relatives of the deceased are poor, then

no feast is given at the time, and the payment of the mourners is also

deferred until such occasion as a sufficient number of blankets and skins

has been collected, and they are in a position to hold the feast. It was

customary to choose the occasion of some big ' potlatch ' gathering, when

everybody would be present.

When the relatives of the deceased have returned from the grave-

yard they burn cedar {Thuya gigantea) and salal-berry {GauUheria Shallon)

branches and whip the whole dwelling with boughs, particularly that part

where the body lay, to drive away the presence of death, sickness, and

ghosts, all of which are supposed to linger there.

Some three or four days after the burial it was not unusual for the

witches and wizards of the tribe to declare that the ghost of the dead had

returned from the land of spirits for something to eat. The relatives of

the deceased are informed, and they iraaiediately gather all the best food

they can procure, and take it, sometimes to the burial-ground and

sometimes into the woods, and spread it out on a big blanket made from

the wool of the mountain sheep or goat. The witches and medicine-men
now invite the shade of the dead to eat. Presently they assure the

relatives that the .spirit is satisfied. The food is then either distributed

to the poor and old, or else it is consumed in a fire built for the occasion.

The customs to be observed by the immediate survivors of the

deceased differ somewhat according to sex. If a woman had lost her

husband she must fast for one whole day. At the close of the day a

neighbour would bring in a large piece of dried fish. The widow must
now bite four mouthfuls from this piece of fish, while it is held in the

neighbour's hands, without touching it herself except Avith her mouth.

After she had eaten her four mouthfuls of fish she might partake of other

food, but nmst be careful to abstain from eating it before her children.

.Should the food bo eaten in the presence of the children it avus believed

that they would all shortly die, the act being regarded as equivalent to

' eating up their life.' This rule must be strictly observed for the space

of a month. For the same period she must bathe the first thing every

morning and scrub her body with boughs, after which she must blow on
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                                  479

the tips of her fingers four times successively if she desired to get stout or

fat, and if she wanted to become thin she must suck in the air from the
tips of her fingers the same number of times. Another practice she must
observe was to place tsutzctcai' c (spruce-boughs) under her bed, and also
hang some at the head of it. ' She must also eat her food off these boughs
for at least a month. The widow always accompanied the corpse of her
husband to the burial-place. Her blanket is painted for the occasion with
streaks of red paint, as is also the crown of her head. Excessive weeping
sometimes made her so weak that she had to support herself with a staff
(t'tcdtc) while walking to and from the graveyard. The customs to be

observed by the widower were simpler. He must likewise bathe every

morning at daybreak, and must also abstain from eating before his
children for the space of a month ; but his head was not painted, only his
blanket ; and he puts the tsutzctcai'e only at the head of his bed, and not
under it. Some three or four days after the burial all the relatives of the
deceased, except the widow or the widower, must cut their hair. The
severed hair is always carefully collected and buried. After the ceremony
of hair-cutting is over all those who have attended the funeral go in a
line to the river or the inlet, according to the locality, and walk down
into the water till it is up to their breasts ; then at a word they all dip
together once and come out again. If they are wearing blankets at the
time they cast these aside, but otherwise do not trouble to disrobe.

     It was customary for widows and orphans some time during the
mortuary rites to take a small white pebble and roll it in their mouths
four times. This was supposed to prevent the teeth from decaying.

Birth Customs.

It was customary among the Sk'qo'mic women to retire to the woods

when they were about to give birth to their children. Usually a woman

went quite alone or accompanied only by her husband. Midwives were

called in for the first child, but afterwards only in cases of difficulty or

when the labour was unduly prolonged. Usually the woman would fulfil

her daily duties to within an hour of the child's birth, and be ready to

take them up again a few hours afterwards. In the case of first children

parents of standing would engage three or four midwives or experienced

women for the occasion. Each had her own special duties to perform.

These were prescribed by long- established custom. It was the office of

one to sever the umbilical cord and dispose of the after-birth ; of another
to watch and care for the baby ; and of another to ' cook the milk ' and
generally look after the mother. They were paid for their services im -

mediately after the event by the husband with gifts of blankets. This

honoraiium was also prescribed by usage, the number of blankets given on

the occasion depending on the husband's social position. Immediately

after the birth of the child it is washed all o\er in cold water and then

--wrapped in the softest slo'wi (inner bark of the cedar Thui/a gigantea

beaten till soft and fine) and placed in a cradle of cedar-wood. This
--Acradle was constructed in the following manner :
                                                     piece of cedar-wood

about thirty inches long and ten or twelve inches wide, was first taken
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

a second, and shorter, but considerably broader, piece was then bent over

this in the form of an ai'ch, and fastened in this position to the longitudi-

nal edges of the other, thus forming a kind of pocket. The lower piece,

--480 REPORT 1900.

or bed of the cradle, extended about iouv inches beyond the other at the
foot, and about six inches at the head. The extension at the foot was
bent upwards till it reached an angle of thirty or forty degrees, and
fastened in this position to the upper piece by lacing. ' This formed a kind
of foot-board the object of which was to keep tlie baby from slipping
down out of the cradle and allow at the same time the liquids to escape.
The head of the cradle was left open. The child passed the first year of
its life in this receptacle, never leaving it except to be washed twice daily.
It was both fed and dandled in its cradle. If the mother had outside
work to do, the cradle was usually slung to her shoulder or to a swing-pole.
In carrying it the weight was borne on the hip. It was during this

cradle existence of the child that the cranial deformation formerly piactised

by this tribe took place. This was effected by fi'ontal pressure, pads or

bands of slu'wi being tied across the anterior part of the cranium and held
Athere by thongs fastened to the bottom of the cradle.
                                                                                                     pad was also tied

across the tojj of the head about the line of the coronal suture to prevent

the head from rising to a ridge here, as was common among the Siciatl

tribe, the Sk-qo'mic regarding this as ugly and unsightly. The immediate

effect of this pressure was threefold. It caused a Hattening of the occi-

pital regioii by contact with the cradle-board ; it gave a peculiarly receding

sweep to the frontal bone, a line of beauty in Sk-qo'mic eyes ; and it pro-

duced a compensatory bulge  of  the  head  laterally                                                 the  genei'al effect of
                                                                                                  ;

all which was to make the head appear abnormally short and the face

unusually broad. This practice of cranial deformation has now, I believe,

been wholly given up by the Sk-qo'mic, though the infant still passes the

greater part of the lirst year of its existence in a cradle as formerly. On

one of my visits to the Sk-qo'mic I observed an Indian mother nursing

her baby in a rush-made cradle with open top. This, I was informed,

was the style now commonly used. Should the birth take place in the

winter, or when it was not convenient for the mother to retire to the

woods, a temporary screen of reed mats would be put up in the general
Adwelling, behind which the woman would give birth to her child.
                                                                                                          very

peculiar custom obtained among the Sk-qo'mic in the case of first-born

children. The mother might not feed the child from the breast for

four days. Her breasts must first be steamed with a decoction of the rind

of the elderberry {Sambucus racemosa), and then covered with poultices

of the same material. This was kept up for four days, its object being to

' cook ' the mother's milk. The process, called in the Sk-qo'mic imo'tlkwai

mlukivum^:^'' cooking the breast,' was sometimes repeated at the birth of

the second child, only on this occasion the infant was not deprived of the

breast. It was thought that the mother's milk was harmful to the child

before the fourth day and before it had been 'cooked.' This strange

custom amongst others may perhajDS have had something to do with the

high death-rate among the old-time children. In earlier days, before

contact with the whites, it was not at all uncommon for a mother to give

birth to a dozen children ; but there were few households Avhich contained

a family of children of more than half of that number. It is true female

children were commonly strangled at birth if there were too many girls

-- --in the family. This unnatural practice war, effected by the parents them-

selves usually by the mother by stopping the nostrils and placing a gag
Myof sluici in the child's mouth.

fate at her birth, and was only spared at the earnest solicitations of an

elder sister.

After the birth of the child, when tlie woman had passed the after-

birth, she was taken or went down to the river or inlet and bathed in the

icy-cold water, no matter what time of year or what kind of weather it

Mywas.                             informant stated that she had been thus taken to the river and

Y.-ashed all over after the birtli of her lirst child in the month of January,

when the water was covered with ice and the ground with snow. Ablu-

tive ceremonies played a vei-y important part in the lives of the old-time

Sk'qO'mic, as we may easily gather from their old customs. J\Ien, women,
and children bathed constantly. Among the young men it formed an
important feature in their training. Each sex had its own special bathing
place, men and women, or boys and girls, after childhood never bathing

together.

     The birth of twins was a very special event, twins always possessing,
it was believed, supernormal powers, the commonest of which was control
of the wind. It would seem that the birth of twins was usually presaged

by dreams on the part of both parents. In these dreams minute instruc-

tions would be given to the parents as to the course they must pursue in
the care and up-bringing of the children. These they must follow im-

plicitly in every particular. If they were neglected it was thought and
believed that the twins would die. If the event took place in winter a

fire must be built in the woods, but the husband must on no account
touch or have anything to do with it.^ Immediately after the birth
both husband and wife must bathe in cold water, using the tips of spruce,

fir, and cedar branches to scrub themselves with. After this they must

remain in seclusion, apart from the rest of the tribe, for a month. Any

breach of this rule was regarded as a grave offence, which was bound to
bring severe punishment upon the offenders. The hair of twins was sup-
posed never to be cut. If for any reason this rule was departed from,
great care had to be taken to bury all that had been cut off. Neglect of
this, it was believed, would bring about a severe winter. Throughout the
whole childhood of the twins the greatest care had to be taken of them.
If at any time wind was desired for sailing, the bodies of the twins ·'.vould

be rubbed with oil or grease, after which, it is said, the wind would im-
mediately rise. The taai'anTd; a kind of small fish which I was unable to
identify, and which periodically visits the Sk-qo'mic River in large
numbers, are said to be descended from a pair of twins (see the story
of the origin of the tsai'annk below, under ' Folk-lore ').

    When a woman desired to give birth to a son she would place during

her pregnancy a bow and arrows under lier bed. If a daughter were
desired a needle and some of the utensils used in weaving would take the
place of the bow and arrows. Another custom to ensure the same end was
for the woman to chew, in the early days of her pregnancy, the leaves of
certain kinds of willow and other shrubs. These leaves were distinguished
as ' male ' and ' female ' leaves.

When a woman desired to bear no more children she adopted one or

more of the following practices. She would get out of bed immediately

after giving birth to her child and stand for some time up to her arm-

pits in the icy cold water of the inlet, or river, or sound, according to her

locality                           or she would bury the after-birth on the beach  at  ebb-tide  just
                                ;

    the line of land and water. Another practice was to han^j the after-
birth on the branch of a tree and keep it there for a twelvemonth. Still
another was to turn round three times and kick the after-birth before it
was disposed of. Usually the mode of disposing of the after-birth was

by burying it secretly in the ground. Among tlie Sk'qo'mic it was never

burned, as among some tribes. lo was believed that the mother would
' swell up ' and die if the after-birth were burned. It is said that a
woman once destroyed the after-birth in this manner with this melan-
choly result ; hence its disposal in this way was ever afterwards most

carefully avoided.

Marriage Customs.

Formei'ly, when a young man took a fancy to a girl and desired to

make her his Avife, the custom was for him to go to the house of the girl's

parents and squat down with his blanket wrapped about him just inside

the door. Here he was supposed to remain for four days and nights

without eating or drinking. During this period no one of the girl's

family takes the slightest notice of him. The only difference his presence

makes in the house is to cause the parents to keep a bright fire burning

all night. This is done that they may readily perceive that he takes no

advantage of his proximity to the girl to make love to her or otherwise
molest her during the night. On the fourth day, if the suitor is accept-

able to the pai'ents, the mother of the girl asks some neighbour to

acquaint the youth that they are willing to accept him as their son-in-

law, and give him the girl. To himself they still say nothing, nor in any

way take the slightest notice of  him                     and  as  no communication  of any
                                                       ;

kind can take place between the girl's people and the young man at this

stage of the proceedings, this neighbour now cooks a meal for the fasting

lover and informs him at the same time that his suit is acceptable to the

family, and that the girl will be given to him in the usual way.

After the young man's acceptance by the girl's parents in the manner

described the youth would then return home, and in a few days come

back for his bride, accompanied by all his friends and relatives. If

he were just an ordinary young man of the tribe, of no particular

standing, he would bring with him one canoe-load of blankets ; but if he

were a person of rank, such as a chief's son, he would bring two canoe-

loads of blankets with him. These he would distribute to the bride's

relatives. He and his friends are now entertained for the rest of the day

by his pi'ospective father m-law, and acconimodation is afforded them for

the night, the inmates of the house sleeping on one side of the building

and the visitors on the other. On the following morning, after a good

meal has been indulged in, all go down to the beach to where the bride-

groom's canoe is moored, the parents of the bride taking with them a

number of blankets, which they put in the canoe. If the bride is a person

of rank the whole course from the house to the beacli is covered with a

line of blankets for her to walk upon, and two old women, as maids-of-

honour, lead her down to the canoe. The bride is dressed for the occasion

in all the bravery of bright-coloured blankets and what other ornaments

she may possess. Over her head, completely enveloping her, a blanket

is thrown as a kind of bridal veil. Behind her come the female slaves of

her father's household, carrying all her personal belongings, such as mats,

baskets, blankets, wooden platters, spoons, (fee. The bridesmaids now

place the bride in the bow of the canoe, after which etiquette demands
ON THE ETHXOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                    483

that the bridegroom shall reward them for their services by a gift of one

or more blankets each. When this has been done the parties separate,

the girl's family and friends going back to the village, and the youth with

his bride and friends returning home. If the girl were the daughter of
ordinary parents she would have to dispense with some of these cere-
monies, such as the walking on blankets, &c. Some days later the bride

and bridegroom and his friends return to the bride's old home, where a

feast is held. After the feast is over they separate again, and some time

later the girl's parents and friends pay a I'eturn visit to her husband's
home, bringing with them blankets and other presents equal in number

and value to those bestowed upon themselves. These are distributed to the

son-in-law and his friends, after which all partake of a second feast, which

closes the marriage ceremonies, and thereafter the girl and youth are

regarded by all as man and wife.

Sometimes the suitor is not acceptable to the girl's parents, and after
Aa family council has been held he is rejected.
                                                 friendly neighbour is

called in as before to act as intermediary and convey to him the decision

of the pai-ents, only on this occasion she provides no meal for him. If

the youth has set his heart on tlie girl he will now try and induce her to

elope with him. If she refuses to do this, he has perforce to give her up

and seek a wife elsewhere. If, however, she consents, he seizes the first

opportunity that offers and carries her off to the woods with him, where

they remain together for several days. If the objection to the young man on
the part of the girl's parents is not deep-rooted, he is now permitted to keep

the girl as his wife on payment to them of a certain number of blankets.

If, however, they object even now to have him as a son-in law, they take

the girl from him, and it is understood on both sides that he is to trouble

her or them no further.

    With regard to the suitor's fast of four days and nights I questioned

my informant whether the old-time youths of the tribe really and truly
abstained from food and drink on these occasions. He assured me they

undoubtedly did, and that it was a matter of honour with them to eat or

drink nothing during the whole period, the significance of their absti-

nence being that they were now men, and could readily endure the hard-

ships and privations incident to manhood. Apropos of this custom he

related to me an instance of what befell a certain luckless youth who
sought surreptitiously to break his fast. The family of the girl whom

he sought to take as wife had all gone out on the third day, leaving him

squatting in his place by the door. They had gone across the inlet to

pay a visit to a village on the other side. The absence of the whole

family tempted the famishing youth to take advantage of his temporary

opportunities to satisfy the cravings of his stomach. So he left his post

and ran down to the beach and hastily dug up some clams. As he was

in the act of eating these a little girl told him that the family was

returning on the water. In his haste to eat the clams he had prepared

he swallowed one whole, and it stuck in his throat and choked him so

that he died. His melancholy end was regai'ded by everybody as richly

deserved, aad his fate was held up thereafter as a warning to succeeding

generations of young men.

These customs are no longer kept up among the great body of the

Sk'qo'mic. Mari'iages among them are now conducted very much after

Athe manner of the whites and solemnised by the priest.  ievf of the

heathen Sk-qO'mic, who still hold by their old tribal cuitoms, continue to

marry their daughters in this way ; but these are few in number, and,

generally speaking, the marriage customs as here described are only a
tradition in the tribe.

   A child usually received no name in babyhood, but when about three

years old the elders of the child's family or clan would choose a name for
it from among those of its ancestors. This name it would bear through
life if a girl, but if a boy, and the son of some person of rank and wealth,
some years later his parents would give a ' potlatch,' and then he would
I'eceive a new name. This was quite commonly that of his own father or

of his paternal grandfather, whether they were alive or dead.
     The names of dead people were tabooed. That is to say, it was a

breach of custom and good manners to mention the name of a dead person

in the presence of the deceased's relatives or connections. This custom

gave rise to inconvenience at times. It was quite common for men to be

called by the name of some implement or utensil. An individual once

=bore the name of Sk-u'mEl 'paddle.' When he died, as they might

not use this term before his relatives, they had to make use of the term
qautllums when they wished to say ' paddle.' I did not get the significa-
tion of this new term. Another person bore the name Slnk-cEn=i ' moccasin.'

When he died a new word had to be coined, and to-day both terms are

in common use for moccasin.

     The stories give us examples of the names used formerly. I append a
few specimens of these here :

Tcla'tmuq = owl.       Cauk- = skull.
                       SQeils = copper.

    When a girl arrived at puberty she would call her mother's attention

to her condition. The mother at once informed the father, who calls the
family and relatives together. They discuss the matter and arrange
what course the giii is to follow.^ First of all they take two strands of
the wool of the mountain sheep or goat and tie them to her hair, one on

each side of her forehead. This is a public notification of the girl's con-

dition, which everybody understands. She is now set to ' pull ' wool or
hair without food or drink for the space of four days. She was kept
without water during this period, because it was believed that if she
drank water when in this condition she would spoil her teeth. She must

abstain from washing or bathing, and must never go near the fire during

the four days.^ When in this condition her mother, or grandmother, or
some other woman would pull out all the irregular hairs from the edges

of her eyebrows so as to make them fine and even. The denuded parts

were always rubbed with the girl's saliva to prevent the hairs growing

again. When the four days were up some old women would take her in

hand, and bathe her head and body in hot water, and scrub her with

same procedure.

branches till her skin was almost torn off and her body was sore and
covered from head to foot with scratches from the severe treatment she
had received. The prickly brambles of the trailing blackberry {Rubiissp.)

were often employed for this purpose, and my informant told me that it

was no uncommon thing for a girl to toss and turn in agony the night
following this bath, unable to close her eyes in sleep for the pain and

smarting of her body.
     If she were the daughter of a chief or a noble she would be bathed by

the sQd'vi'tEn or siu (medicine man or woman). These would be paid for

their services with gifts of blankets or skins.

    The object of these heroic measures was to make the girl ' bright and
smart.' After the bath she was given food and drink and permitted to
come to the fire. Sometimes a friend of the family would mark the
occasion by putting a nice new blanket over the girl's shoulders. After

her meal her face would be painted with streaks of red paint, and the
girl would then go to the forest and pull down the branches of all the
cedar and spruce trees she passed and rub her face and body with their
tips, and then let them spring up again. The object of this practice was
to make her charming and attractive in the eyes of men. She would also
take a quantity of fern-roots of the edible kind [Fteris aquilina) and
offer them to the biggest trees she could find. This was supposed to give
her a generous nature and keep her from becoming stingy and mean.

     After a girl had arrived at puberty she was never allowed to play or
mingle with the boys. She was kept indoors at work all day long. The
lot of a girl among the Sk-qo'mic in the olden days does not appear to

have been an enviable one.

   A girl or woman during her monthly periods was ' bad medicine ;

that is, she was supposed to carry ill-luck with her. If she entered a
sick-room the invalid was sure to get worse ; and if she crossed the path

of a hunter or a fisher he would get no luck that trip.

    When people were sick they were rubbed with dog-fish oil.
    When the sci'eech-owl (cai'u) was heard hooting around a house it

was regarded as a sure sign that some of the inmates would shortly die.

Cai'u signifies 'ghost,' or 'shade.'

                                                                            Dn-elllni/x.

    The dwellings of the old Sk-qo'mic were of the communal kind,
whether they were the ordinary .slab and cedar-board structure or whether
they were the winter keekwilee-house. As far as I have been able to
gather, only the upper tribes on the Sk-qo'mic River used the sk'umi'n, or
keekwilee-house. That this structure was known to them is clear from
the name of one of their villages, which signifies in English ' keekwilee-
house.' The lower tribes commonly used the cedar structure all the year
round. Each village contained one and sometimes two of these placed at

right angles to one another, or in parallel lines according to the local

peculiarities of the village site. Some of them, in the more populous
villages, were of enormous length, extending in an inibroken line for
upwards of 600 feet. Houses of two or three hundred feet in

length were very ordinary dwellings. In width they varied from 20
 to 40 feet. The walls, too, were of variable height, ranging from S to

 15 feet when the roofs were gabled. If the roof contained but one slope,
 then the higher side would rise to 25 or even 30 feet. Both sides and
roof were built of cedar boards or slabs split with hammer and wedges
486 EEPORT--1900.

from the cedar trunk. The cedar (Thuya giyantea) of British Columbia
lends itself readily to operations of this kind, and the task is not as
difficult as might be imagined. The white settlers almost everywhere
build their houses, stables, fences, and barns of cedar split by themselves
in this way. I ha\'e seen boards split out as smooth and uniform as if
they had been cut out with a saw and planed. In the native dwellings
the boards were held in place by withes or ropes made from young cedars
or from the branches of older ones. There were no windows in these
buildings ; sunlight and air came in through the doors or by the roof, a
part of which was pulled down a few feet to let the smoke out and the
air and light in during the day in fine weather. These structures are
open from end to end without partitions or divisions of any kind. The
chief quite commonly occupied the centre of the dwelling. Next to him,
on either side, came his brothers and other notabilities, and beyond these
the baser folk. Each family had its own allotted space at tlie side of the
dwelling and its own fire. This sjaace was commonly just ample enough

to allow of the Ijeds of the family being arranged around three sides of a
square with an open front towards the tire and centre of the room

thus  . The bed was raised by a kind of platform or bed-stand about

two feet from the ground. In the space beneath were stored roots
and such-like commodities. Above and over the beds shelves were hung.

On these were stored the dried fish and utensils of the family. If the

family were one of position and wealth, several large cedar l)oxes would
be found lying about. These would contain the blankets and skins and
other valuables of the owners. To separate the beds of one family from
another, hanging curtains of grass and reeds were suspended on either
side, but the front was left open. The beds of the Sk-qo'niic consisted of
reed mats and slo'wi, i.e., the inner bark of the cedar beaten till fine and
soft. Rolls of the same material formed their pillows. Their coverings
were, for the poorer class, mats of the same materials. For the wealthy
these were supplemented by mountain- goat blankets and dressed deer-
skins. The Sk-qu'mic husband and wife ditl not sleep side by side, but
feet to feet. If the bed space was coniincd the feet of ojie would reach
to the head of the other ; but usually this was not the case, plenty of
room being allowed.

     In winter it was customary to keep the fires burning all night, large

logs being placed upon them for the purpose. On the occasion of feasts

and dances the hanging mats about the beds would all be taken down,
the beds themselves serving for seats or platforms for the drummers and

spectators.

     The Sk'qo'mic housekeeper possessed cooking pots of both cedar and
basketry. Food was served in large shallow cedar troughs or dishes.
Smaller platters of the same material were also in use, likewise spoons,

though these were also made of horn. When eating they sat on mats or

squatted on their haunches. Of baskets they had a great variety. Some
of these were made from the split roots of young cedar, spruce, or fir trees,
others from the bark of the alder and birch.

                                                                    Dress.

      Tlie dress of the Sk'qo'mic in prse-trading days did not differ materially

from that of other tribes of this region. The men commonly wore high
                 ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  487

leggings and waist-cloth. Over their shoulders, when they were not
actively engaged, they wore, toga-fashion, a native blanket. The women

of the nobler class wore a dressed deer-skin shroud or smock, which

reached from the shoulders to below their knees ; inferior women wore
only short petticoats of woven slo'ioi. Moccasins were worn at times by
both sexes. The women sometimes covered their heads with a plaited

conical hat with broad sloping brim. This served also as a receptacle for

berries and other small things if no basket were at hand. The exterior of
these hats was commonly figured in red and black paints or dyes. Some
of the older women may still be occasionally seen wearing them, but they
have gone out of use generally.

                                            Taltiioinij and Painting.

    In earlier days the men used to paint themselves for dancing and other
ceremonies. I could not learn that the men ever tattooed their bodies.

A favourite decoration was that effected by sprinkling particles of mica

over their faces and bodies upon a groundwork of grease. This gave

                         Markings on right arm above back of the hand.

their bodies a glistening appearance. They obtained the mica for this

purpose from disintegrated granite. The women commonly employed a

kitid of red clay for facial decoration. This they smeared over their

cheeks, chins, and foreheads. When confined only to the cheeks and not

too lavishly put on the effect was not displeasing to the eye. It gave

them a ruddy, comely appearance. The old women of pagan habits still

decorate themselves in this way. The women were accustomed to tattoo

themselves on the arm or wrist and lower leg. The markings were

always simple and generally crude, bearing no resemblance whatever to

the elaborate and fanciful designs of the Haida and other northern

AIndians.  copy of the markings on the arms of one of my informants,

is given above.

                                                           Games.

     The Sk-qO'mic had a variety of games. I obtained some information
on some of these. The commonest and most popular were the ball games
488 REi'OKT-- 1900.

Of these they had two called k-t'k-qua and tcqui'la. The former was a
kind of lacrosse, and the ball was caught and thrown with an instrument
similar to the lacrosse stick. The other was a kind of football. They
played also a game called tckivle. Tliis was a kind of shuttlecock and
Dattledore, and a favourite pastime of the girls. Tliey were acquainted
also with ' qamoi'lts,' or the ' cat's-cradle ' game. But dancing and
dramatic impersonations of animals were their favourite pastimes, and
these played an important part in the tribal festivities in earlier days.

                                                                                                   IJanccs.

The SkqO'mlc had three kinds of dances, called respectively mP'tla,

koiiohs, and skaip. The hrst was the common dance, which any one

could perform                                                                    the  second  was  characterised by spasmodic  shakings  of
                                                                              ;

the head on the part of the dancer ; the third had for its distinguishing

feature a shaking or violent trembling of the hand, which was held aloft

in the air during the dance. In this dance the dancer spits much biood,

or something which has the appeai'ance of blood. I have not myself

seen a dance of this kind, so cannot say whether it is really blood or not.

As they appear to be none the worse after the dancing is over they pro-

bably do not spit blood. "NVhen dancing they invarial>]y sing. These

dance-songs are private property. No one can use another person's song

unless permission has been given, or unless it belongs jointly to more

than one person. These dance-songs are acquired by inheritance or they

are learnt in dreams. Dreams or visions are the original source of all

Atheir dances.                                                                   person dreams of a certain dance, and on the next

occasion introduces it. Not every one is a dancer ; only those who are

by mental temperament fitted for the part ever become noted dancers.

AThe reason of this is simple.                                                                     dancer during the performance of his

dance is not in a normal condition of mind. He or she is practically in a

hypnotic trance state. On the occasion of a dance the dancers come

forward as they are moved or promj^ted by self-suggestion or the mental

suggestion of the waiting audience. They sit passive Avaiting for the

'psychological moment,' just precisely as do the sitters in a ' mediumistic

circle.' The monotonous beating of cedar boards oil all sides, which is

their dance music, has the effect of sending some of them into hypnotic

trances. First one and then another heaves a deep sigh, or utters sounds

indicative of mental disorder ; some swoon outright, and have to ha
brought to a dancing condition by the dashing of cold water over them

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and some start off in a kind of frenzy, and dance from tire to fire all

round the building till they fall exhausted from their exertions.

    Dancers had to undergo a certain training. When young men or women

desired to become dancers they had first to subject themselves to a four

days' fast. In this condition it was easy for tJieni to pass into the

hypnotic state. In the case of the girls in particular they would in-

variably swoon away on the fourth night, v/hen the dance would be held,

and the s<j07n'tj^n and the s'Jd woidd work upon them to restore them to

consciousness. Presently a girl would come out of her swoon with a

deep sigh and begin singing, and then start off dancing for half an hour.

This dance she is supposed to have learnt in her trance. When she has

finished her ^performance she is driven out into the forest among the

trees. The purpose of this is that she may learn a new dance from the

bushes and trees, which they think are able to hold communication with

the neophyte in hen present state and impart to her some of their know-
            ox TlIK ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  489

ledge. After a while she returns to the building again and performs a

new dance. When a novice performs his or her tirst dance it is called

their luiv.sd'lktl. Nearly all the spectatoi's of the dances beat time with

sticks on loose cedar boards placed on the beds. The movements of the

dnncers are various, agility and endurance being more aimed at than

what we should call grace. Prancing like a high-stepping horse is a

Annoted feature in some of the men's dances.  old resident of the dis-

trict, Mr. Jonathan Miller, now postmaster of Vancouver City, but who

formerly had much to do with the Indians in his capacity of provincial

constable, informed me that at the close of one of their dances, whicli

took place about thirty-eight years ago at the village of QoiQoi (=masks),

in Stanley Park, which then had a population of 700, and now contains

but one family, a noted medicine-man, or sQom'tEti, gave a performance.

He came into the circle with a small living dog in his teeth. As he
danced he devoured the creature piecemeal. He bit the skin from its

nose and tore it backwards with his teeth till he reached the throat.

He then tore off pince after piece of the flesh and danced round the

building, devouring it as he went. This dance was known as the ' dog-

dance.' This is no longer practised even by the pagan bands, as far as I

can learn.

     There was a custom among the Sk-qo'mic of ' bringing out ' a girl, not
altogether unlike the custom among ourselves. In the case of a girl who

had lost her mother when she had reached the age of puberty she was

publicly ' brought out ' at the next dance, and sang and danced her

mother's song and dance before the whole community. She was attired

for the occasion in a special garment or head-dress. When the people

were assembled for the dancing an elderly man of the girl's family would

proclaim aloud that Soand-.so was going to dance and sing her mother's

song. Her brothers or her cousins would now prepare and robe her.

This ceremony was called sd'yTniiaitl, and consisted in placing upon her

head a kind of Acil composed of tails made from the wool of the moun-

tain-goat, which hung down all round her person, and bobbed and

swayed as she moved. The garment was called no y Fi dieu . If the girl

were a good industrious si.ster the brothers would .show their esteem and

regard for her by seating her on a pile of blankets, afterwards to be

given away to mark the occasion. Usually the ceremony took place in

the house, but sometimes a platform would be erected on several canoes

joined together on the water, and the dance would take place there.

When the announcement would be made of the dance all the people

would show their pleasure by clapping their hands much as a Avhite

audience does. In earlier times the girl danced on a blanket, which

was afterwards S(iii1s, or scrambled for by the onlookers, each wildly

endeavouring to get a piece of it. Every one who secured a grip of the

blanket was entitled to cut off all he held in his hand. These pieces of

blanket were not prized as mere souvenirs of the occasion, as might be

thought, but rather as precious material to be rewoven into another

blanket. That is the reason why blankets at potlatches and other feasts

were cut into pieces if there were not enough Avhole ones to go round
among the guests. Mountain-goat wool was a valuable commodity,
and not easy to secure hence the value of even a small piece of blanket.

                                                                                                                       ;

This sQiilg, or scrambling, was always an exciting scene, and because of

an accident that happened on one of these occasions to the debutante by

the over-eagerness of the crowd to get at the blanket, it was afterwards

always suspended over the girl's head while she danced, and when she
had finished it was taken down and thrown to the audience, who

litei'ally cut and tore it to pieces. In later times, after the intro-
duction of Hudson's Bay blankets, the pieces secured from the sadls of
these were sewn together to make baby blankets of.

                                                                   Fotlatches,

     The Sk'qu'mic in common with other tribes of this region were given

to holding ' potlatclies.' These have been so often described tliat it is un-
necessary to give au account of them here. They were the occasion of

great gatherings. Whole tribes from long distances would be invited
sometimes. Representatives from Lytton and Kamloops in the interior,
and from the upper coast and Vancouver's Island, were present on one

occasion at QoiQoi. Over 2,000 in all sat down to the feast. An immense

quantity of property was distributed on this occasion, estimated by Mi*.

J. Miller, who was present, to be worth over |)^5,000. On another and

later occasion chief SemEla'no, the head of one of the confederated bands
at the mouth of the Fraser, gave away ^3,000 in silver and 2,000

blankets.

                                                               Wars.

     The Sk'qo'niic would sometimes wage war svith their northern neigh-
bours the Stlatlumii or Lillooets. They had also to defend themselves
from marauding bands of Chilcotins, but their most dreaded enemies were
the U'keltaws, a I (and of the Kwakiutl tribe. These latter were long the
scourge of the coast from the northern end of Vancouvei 's Island to the
Columbia, and from the mouth of the Fraser up to Yale. There is not a
tribe on the Fraser that has not memories of evil times and bitter losses
caused by the visits of this band. Only on one occasion is it recorded
that the Sk'qo'mic got the better of their foes, and that since the white
man's time and the advent of lirearms. It is told that the yk-qo'mic
scouts brought timely wai-ning of the approach of two war canoes of
U'keltaws. The Sk-qO'mic at that time had a courageous and resourceful

leader in their head chief Kiapila'noQ. He assembled a number of the

bravest men and best shots of the tribe and hid them in a log hut built
for the purpose at the mouth of the narrows leading into Burrard Inlet.
On the flats immediately in front of the hut he placed some of the women

and children, who were to jDretend to be gathering drift wood. When
the U'keltaws came into the narrows they at once perceived the women

and children, and, thinking to secure these for slaves in the apparent

absence of the men, they landed. The women and children now tied

towards the woods, drawing their pursuers after them close to the hut.
The hidden Sk'qo'mic now opened tire upon the U'keltaws and killed
every one without harm to themselves. The very name of this band was
a terror to the other tribes, and the mothers would frighten their children
into silence and quiet by saying the U'keltaws were coming for them.
In most of the villages they had palisaded enclosures to retire into when
hard pressed by this enemy.

                                                                  Food.

     The principal and staple food of the Sk'o'mic was salmon. These,
fresh in season and dried out of season, were to them what bread is to the
European and rice to the Oriental, and great was the distress and famine
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                      491

        if the salmon catch was poor. Their traditions tell of troubles of this
        kind occasionally. They also hunted the deer with dogs, and occasionally
        secured a mountain -goat or two. In hunting the deer they did not shoot
        or trap them. The dogs were ti-ained to drive them into the water, where

       they were easily despatched by men in canoes. Some of the men were
       skilful with the bow and arrow, and secured by this means many duck,

        &c., but it was in fishing the tribe excelled. Fruits and roots of various

       kinds were also eaten by them. This we may gather for ourselves from
       their folk-tales. I was unable to secure the native names of many of

      these. Sucli of those as I did get will be found in my vocabulary of

         Sk'qo'mic tei'ms below, with their botanical equivalents. I could not

        learn that any family or village had exclusive rights over fishing, hunting,

       or berry and root grounds. These seemed to be common to all alike.
       Neither could I hear anything of ' First Fruits ' ceremonies as among the
        N'tlaka'pamuQ and River Indians. The chiefs used formerly to pray for
       the tribe or village to Te tcitl sla'm, the upper chief, but I could learn no

        particulars of these prayers. They have been in contact, more or less

       close, Avith white men for over two generations, and this intercourse, with
       the influence of the missionaries, has broken down and thrust aside many
       of their old pagan beliefs and practices, many of which are not known at
      all by the younger men and women, and almost forgotten by the older

       ones. Like the other tribes of this region they were fond of fish- oils, and

       particularly salmon-oil. They extracted oil from the sturgeon, the seal,

I the salmon, and the dog-fish. They stored these oils away in bottles made

       from the sounds, or air-bladders, of certain fish. They used this oil for a
       variety of purposes besides food. One of these was the anointing of
       the bodies of sick persons and also the bodies of twins when wind was

          desired.

P/ii/sica/ Characteristics,

With the exception of about a score of photographs of men and boys

of the yk'qo'mic I regret to say that I can add no new matei-ial to our

knowledge of the physical characteristics of this tribe. Dr. Boas's earlier

work along these lines among them so prejudiced their minds against

anything of the kind that I found it impossible to do anything with them,

more particularly after the death of the late Bishop Durieu, who had a

great influence over them. The good Bishop had made an appointment

with me just before his death sickness, and had promised to exercise his

influence in my behalf, and I was sorely disappointed to learn of his

death. He told me himself that on tlie occasion of Dr. Boas's visit many

of the Indians ran away and hid themselves in the woods rather than sub-

mit to the examinations. I made an effort, however, and chief George

' rounded ' me up a score or so of children of all ages, but the mothers of

them came upon us before I had measured the first boy's head and dragged

them all ofi". After this I gave up the attempt to do anything with them

in this way. I may say, however, that, like the N'tlaka'pamuQ, they are

of which is distinctly and markedly Mongolic. I regret being unable to

secure a good specimen of this type among my photographs.

     Archaeological investigation carried on within the territory of the

Sk"q6'mic has resulted in revealing to us, among other things, one fact of
--492 REPORT 1900.

special importance. This is that the shores and hays of Burrard Inlet
and English Bay have been occupied by rude communities of people for^

--very considerable period of time. The midden heaps here the chief monu-
--ments of the past in this region are of two kinds or classes, and clearly

belong to two distinct periods. There is the class represented by the
refuse heaps seen in the vicinity of every camp site on the coast, and
which, generally speaking, are composed almost wholly of the shells of
various bivalves, mostly of the clam and mussel kind, and which are
clearly of modern or comparatively modern date ; and there is the class
composed of fewer shells, which are mostly fractui'ed and partially decom-
posed, numbers of calcined stones and large quantities of ashes and other
earthy matter. The latter accumulations bear every characteristic of age,

and are undoubtedly of ancient date. I believe these two classes of

middens are to be found everywhere on this coast. Wherever I have

gone  I  have  always  met with  them                         and  Dr. G. M. Dawson  has  also
                                                           ;

mentioned them as occurring on the Queen Charlotte Islands in his

paper on the Haidas. At all events they are particularly characteristic of

this region, and are perhaps the most interesting feature of its archreology.

Evidence of an anatomical kind has been secured from the middens of

this older class in the neighbouring district of the Eraser, which leads us

to believe that a pre-Salishan race once occupied these shores and bays

and formed these heaps. Crania, of a type Avholly different from those
recovered from the burial-grounds of the modern tribes, have been dug

up in some of these older heaps. The Sk'qo'mic territory is particularly

rich in these evidences of a distant past. On both shores of Burrard
Inlet, on English Bay, and around False Creek, the remains of many of

these ancient middens are to be found. In some instances they have
been partially Avashed aWay by the tides, owing to a subsidence in the

land since the heaps were formed. In some places the decaying stumps

of old cedar and fir trees of immense size are seen embedded in the midden

mass. There can be no doubt that many of these stumps ai-e over half a
millennium old. They are the remains of what is locally known as the

first forest. In numerous instances I have found them and tlie middens
overlying the glacial gravels and claj's with no intervening mould or soil
between them, while all around in the same vicinity the vegetable mould

covers both the gravel and the middens themselves to a depth of from

six to twelve inches. Indeed tlie presence of these old camja sites can

often only be discovered by examining the strata of the banks facing the

tides.

    There is a second reason which leads me to regard these older heaps

as prie-Salishan formations. They are not included by the Sk'qo'mic
among their old camp sites in the enumeration of their ancient o'k-irumriq,

or villages. There is nothing in the Sk'qo'mic traditions which indicates

that they were ever occujiied by members of the Sk'qo'mic tribe. In my

ov/n mind there is no doubt whatever that they are centuries older than
the oldest known Sk'qo'mic refuse heaps or camp sites, and were formed

by a preceding race. The relics recovered from these ancient middens
are not, however, distinguished in any marked manner from those found
elsewhere on more modern sites. They represent the usual specimens
of bone and stone weapons and utensils, rough and crude specimens being
found side by side with finely wrought and polished ones. But if they
do not differ in any special manner from known Sk'qo'mic specimens

neither do they, for the matter of that, except in the kind of stone
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                           493

employed, from the remains of ancient peoples elsewhere. Many stone

arrow and spear points have been picked up on the beach adjacent to the

heaps, from which they have been obviously washed by the action of the

tides, which have at some points almost demolished the midden piles.

Jade or nephrite adzes, axes, and chisels have also been picked up in the

same vicinity ; and lai'ge numbers of spear and arrow heads ' in the
rough ' are unearthed from time to time. These latter were apparently

hoards or magazines. They can be picked up on the northern shore of

Stanley Park at low tide by the score. They are not to be confounded

with the waste chips of the arrow maker's workshop so characteristic of

      some prehistoric camp sites. They are clearly the raw material of the

I spear and arrow point maker, all showing evidence of having been skilfully

   --broken for the pui'pose from water-worn boulders of dark basalt. No

       one could mistake their purpose their outlines are too obvious. In

form, material, and colour they differ radically from the ordinary pebbles

and stones of the beach.

As these old middens in the Sk'qo'mic territory resemble in most of

their features, except extent and mass, the great middens of the Lower

Fraser, I would refer those who desire to learn more of them to my
paper on ' Prehistoric Man in British Columbia,' published in the ' Trans-

actions ' of the Royal Society of Canada for 1896, in which I have treated

of these middens at some length.

Since the Sk-qd'mic have come under the influence of the missionaiies

they have not only buried their dead in proper graveyards, but have

also gathered up and interred in the same place such remains of their

dead as could be recovered from their former burial-places. It is difficult,

therefore, to secure anatomical material from this region. Some ten or

twelve years ago, when the Vancouver City authorities were making the

road which now runs round the edge of the penisula which constitutes

Stanley Park, they opened one of the larger of the later or Salish

Amiddens, utilising the material for the road bed.  considerable number

of skeletons was disinterred from the midden mass during the operation,

the larger bones and crania of which were gathered up and placed in

boxes which were afterwards hidden in the forest where I discovered

Athem a few years later. The crania had then fallen to pieces.  boxful

of these bones I shipped later to the Dom. Geol. Survey Museum

at Ottawa. From the fact of these bones being found thus inhumated

as well as from the recovery of a skeleton in a fair state of

preservation in the same heap by myself, it would seem to appear that

burial by inhumation sometimes took place in former times even by the

Sk'qo'mic themselves, though this was not the prevailing custom when

we first came into contact with them. There is, however, no record of

burials of this kind in the tribal recollection that I could learn, the

traditional method of burial being that already described in my mortuary

notes, and it is quite possible these burials in the midden mass were

due to the presence of some pestilence or epidemic such as their traditions

speak of, and such as we know on good testimony caused the inhumation

of a large number of corpses in the Hammond midden on the Fraser

a few generations ago. The tribe inhabiting this district was almost

decimated by small-pox. So terrible was the scourge that they abandoned

their village site after burying all their dead in a big hole. In digging

the foundations of his house, the rancher who now owns this spot came

upon this pit of bones, and in consequence chose another site for his
--494 REPORT 1900.

dwelling. In the traditional history of the Sk'qo'mic we learn of some

terrible sickness which killed off whole villages and caused the abandon-

ment of many o'kwumuqs. The presence of these human remains in the

midden in the park may be due to this or some similar cause. No

relics, as far as I could learn from the man who had charge of the road

makin»5 were found with the bodies ; which fact would seem to indicate
that they had not been buried in the usual way. I have never discovered
or heard of any mounds or tumuli within the territories of the
Sk-qo'mic such as are found on the banks of the Lower Fraser and
elsewhere. It is extremely doubtful if any such exist among them. Of

the old weapons or utensils the stone pestle-hammer is the only one now
found among them. I have frequently seen the older men using this

tool ; indeed they prefer it to our hammers. I once showed some of the

youn^^er men some stone arrow and spear points. They did not know
what they were or what they had been used for. They had a very
ingenious way of keeping their wedges from splitting under the repeated
blows of the hammer when splitting cedar boards, etc. Tliey bound the
head of the wedge in a most skilful manner with a ring of twisted

fibres or split cedai-root which answered the same purpose and almost
as effectively as the iron ring on our mallets and chisels. Besides
wooden wedges they also used horn ones. Several of their modern tools
are fashioned after the pattern of the ancient ones, notably the steel
adze they employ in canoe-making and the women's salmon knife.
The latter is of the half-moon shape, and generally foi^med from a piece
of a saw, and corresponds in everything but material to the prehistoric

slate knives of the middens.

    There is a point in canoe-making which the Sk'qo'mic share in common

with the other coast tribes of this region to which I cannot recall that
any pi-evious writer has drawn attention, but which very aptly illustrates
the skill and judgment displayed by our British Columbia Indians in
their adaptation of means to ends, and upon which a few remarks
will not be out of place here. In shaping the canoe from the solid log
the outlines marked out by the builder are very different from those

the canoe takes when finished. When looked at from the side just before

the steaming process preparatory to spreading the beam has been
effected it is seen to have distinctly convex gunwales which rise
<^radually in the centre six or eight inches above the line of the bow and
stern, while the bottom of the canoe is correspondingly concave. The
object of this is to insure the gunwales having the proper sweep and
curve from bow to stern after the spreading process has taken place,
and to prevent the bottom bellying out in the centre, fi-ora the same
cause. The greater the beam is spi-ead the higher must the gunwales
rise at the centre, and the greater must be the concavity of the
bottom. In large canoes where the beam is six or seven feet, and

the lof originally perhaps less than five feet through, to allow of
this spread of two feet or so, a very considerable convexity in the
wunwales and a proportionate concavity in the bottom of the vessel are

necessary. This spreading of the canoe is in itself a very nice task,

calling for much judgment and care. It is effected by partially filling

it with water and then dropping in heated stones till the water is at

boiling heat. On the outside of the canoe, and in close proximity to its

sides, fires are also kept up, care being exercised that the sides of the

canoe are not burnt in the process. The heat of the fires and ths
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  495

steaming and soaking give a certain degree of elasticity to the cedar,
and prevent the thin sides of the canoe from splitting or cracking under
the strain of the spreading. The sides are kept apart and in the proper
position by fixed narrow thwarts. The native canoe-builder knows to a
nicety just what convexity and concavity to allow respectively to the
sides and bottom in every instance, and rarely errs in his calculations.

Not every Indian is a canoe builder of the first order, the art requiring
nice judgment and an experienced eye, and our admiration may well
be excited by the ingenious method the canoe-builders adopt in over-
coming the difficulties imposed upon them by the narrowness of the
log. Tn the hollowing out of the log the canoe-builder again shows his
skill and nice judgment. The thickness of the sides and bottom of a
canoe is generally under an inch. To the onlooker nothing seems easier
than to miscalculate this thickness, and pare off too much or too little
in places. Yet the native canoe-builder never does this, but chips out

his canoe as uniformly as if it had been turned out of a mould, his only

aid being his finger-tips. He feels the sides and bottom from time to

time as he goes along by the tips of his fingers, placing a hand on each

side of his work. By this means he can tell to a nicety the exact thick-

ness of the shell. The Sk-qo'mic have five different canoes, each called
by a special tei'm. One at least of these, the Chinook canoe, is a
borrowed form. I cannot say if the others originated with themselves.
They have of late years added a sixth to their number. This new one is
a racing canoe, built on the lines of our four-oared outrigger. I saw
one of these at the Mission across Burrard Inlet, the beautiful, graceful
lines of which would do no discredit to a first-class yacht-builder. It
was hollowed from a cedar log in the usual way, and outrigged
like a regular shell, and was altogether a splendid piece of native

workmanship.

                                     LINGUISTICS.

    The following notes on the languages of the Sk.-qo'mic will be the more welcome

inasmuch as they constitute the tirst serious attempt, as far as the writer has been
able to learn, to give the peculiarities of the structure of this dialect. While the

Sk-qo'mic possesses many of the characteristics common to the Salish tongue, its
dialectal differences are so many and great as to mark it off into a distinct class of
its own. It shows resemblance to both the Alkome'lEm dialects of the Lower Fraser

on the one hand and to the dialects of the tribes of the interior on the other, but is
quite distinct from any of these, and possesses a grammatical formation, character,
and vocabulary whuUy its own, which renders it impossible for its speakers to hold

extended converse with the neighbouring tribes without the aid of the trade jargon.

Though my studies of this tongue have extended more or less over the whole period
of my residence in these parts, it is only during the past year that I liave given any-

thing like connected thought to the work. Having found an intelligent helper this

spring in my studies in the person of a half-breed named Annie Carrasco, I have

taken advantage of her assistance to gather a fairly extensive list of phrases and
sentences illustrative of the laws aiid structure of the language. From these and

from the story of the SmailEtl, which I have written in the original Sk-qo'mic, a fair

knowledge of this dialect may now, with the aid of my notes, be obtained.
    My method of working was to supplement the services of Mrs. Carrasco with

those of one or more full-blooded Sk-qo'mic. These were generally a woman named

Annie Kivers and Chief Thomas of Kuk-aios. My notes, therefore, will, I trust, be

free from those errors which sometimes creep into our studies of the native tongues
when only the services of half-breeds, with limited and imperfect knowledge of the

language, are employed. There are many ways of expressing the same thoughts
and ideas in Sk-qo'mic as in other torgues. 1 have, however, in my grammar notes
 Bought to record at all times the correct or ' classic ' formsi ColloquiallsmB and
--496 REPORT 19UU

' slangey ' phrases are quite common, and these are active factors of change in tlie
Sk-qo'mic language as in others. Chief Thomas and others of the older men informed

me that the language had, changed considerabl}' during the past fifty years, and that
every generation of speakers brought in new phrases and espressions, some of which

die out and are forgotten, wliile others are perpetuated and in time become 'classic'
or correct forms of speech. It is clear, therefore, that precisely the same laws
prevail in the speech of barbarous, unlettered peoples like the Sk-qo'mic as in the
language of cultivated and literary stocks.
                6N THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OP CANADA.            497

syllable signifies ' hair,' but with the accent on the final syllable, sa sk-umai', it means
' dog.' It seems impossible to lay down any general rule for the position of the
accent. In words of two syllables the accent is perhaps oftener placed upon the
former than upon the latter syllable ; but the exceptions to this usage are so many
tliat it hardly constitutes a rule. Speaking generally, the place of the accent may be
said to depend upon the composition of the word. If the word be composed of
different radicals having special or independent signification, then the accent will be
found on the most important element or radical in the synthesis ; as stlEntlanaio'tl =
girls, where the accented syllable signifies 'youth,' the idea to be brought out in the
compound. If we want to say ' women ' instead of ' girls ' this final syllable is
wanting, and the accent falls on the second syllable ; as stlEntla'nai. But there
are many exceptions to this rule also, for in the compounds sua-tci'ca = step-mother
and sua-ma'n = step-father we have the accent on 'mother' and 'father' respectively,
and not, as by the rule we should expect to find it, on the first syllable siia- = step, as

in English. An analysis of the 550 words, more or less, of my vocabulary of the

Sk-qo'mlc seems to show also that syllables containing a long vowel oftener take the
accent than syllables containing a short vowel ; but whether this is a mere coincidence

or due to the superior importance of the syllable in question I am unable to

determine.

                                                             Tone.

     In monosyllabic terms a tonic accent is at times plainly discernible. It resembles
one of the rising tones in Chinese. Father Morice has pointed out the same
peculiaritj' in several of the dialects of the Dene. There, however, the function of
tone is the same as in Chinese and marks a difference of meaning in words of the

same form and sound ; but in Skqo'mic this is not so. What purpose this tonic

accent subserves in the Sk-qO'mic dialect is not at present clear to me.

                                     NUMBER.

The Sk'q6mic contains no true plural : its place is supplied by a distributive formed

as in N'tlaka'pamuQ by amplification of the stem, either by reduplication, epenthesis,

or diaeresis. Reduplication in the Skqo'mic is not so strong a feature as in

N'tlaka'pamuQ, epenthesis and diseresis occurring oftener. The plurals of both nouns

and adjectives  are  formed in this  way                     as
                                                          ;

but in the sentence ' I have ten houses,' the numeral takes the common form u'pKH.
It is the same with two = d'nos, which is amplified in the same way by the reduplica-

tion of the initial vowel. I could not learn that this modification took place with

other than the word horses, though it is possible my informant's memory may have

been at fault. It is quite clear, however, that these modified forms are not commonly

used.

                                  INSTRUMENTAL NOUNS.

   We find the same suffix -tsn employed in the Sk-qo'mic to mark instrumentality

as in the N'tlaka'pamuQ, though not always applied to corresponding expressions

    These terms are very interesting and instructive, throwing much light upon the
method of noun formation which is extremely simple in Sk'qO'mic.

                           AGENT NOUNS.

     These nouns are differently formed from the corresponding class in the N'tlaka'-

pamuQ, which takes a suffix in -utl. Here we find the particle prefixed and quite

different in form ; as

nuqskoi'lEc, a shooter,    from koilac, to shoot         to hunt
nuqspipi'atotl, a hunter,
nuqstEkw'un'p, a digger,     ,, pla'totl or plpia'tOtl,
nuqtze'tzap, a worker,       ,, tEkwu'n'p, to dig
nuqte'tcEm, a swimmer,
nuqska'tzut, a runner,      ,, tze'tzap, to work
nuqslu'lo, a singer,              te'tcEm, to swim
nuqsqai'aqai, a laugher,
nuqca'm, a crier,              ,,
nuqsme'tla, a dancer,
                             ,, sk-atzut, to run
                             ,, slu'lo, to sing

                             ,, sqai'aqai, to laugh
                            ,, ham, to cry
                             ,, me'tla, to dance

                                  COMPOUND NOUNS.

    While there are numerous instances of compound terms in the Sk-qo'mic vocabu-

lary, the composite connotive noun is not a distinguishing feature of the language.

An analysis of my collection of words shows that a preponderating number of them

are of the simple, denotive class of monosyllabic or dissyllabic form. Incorporation

or polysyntheticism scarcely finds a place in Sk-qo'mic, the compound forms partak-
ing rather of the character of the Greek and Latin compound terms in English than
the ponderous syntheses of the Dene and Algonkin. The new compound term
employed by the Sk-qo'mic to express the idea of a garden is a fair example of the
formation of their composite terms. Formerly they had no gardens of their own,
and so had to coin a word when they took up hon iculture. This term is ns-pEn-
ma'i, which is formed by the juxtaposition of these independent monosyllabic
 radicals which signify respectively ' where ' ' get,' ' fruit ' or ' vegetables,' and the

 whole thus means ' the place where one gets fruit or vegetables.'

     Other examples may be seen in the terms employed to express the seasons of the
 year, where we have the same simple juxtaposition of independent radicals. The

 analysis of the composite terms in Sk-qo'mic is, therefore, relatively an easy task. For
 example, the word sentlqOyatc, meaning ' thumb,' is thus resolved : sentl = first or

 oldest qO = finger yatc = the composite form for ' hand.' This last element is
                                 ;;

 necessary in the synthesis to distinguish the word from 'big-toe,' which would be thus

 written, sentl-qo-cin, cin signifying ' foot.' And so with the word for ' little finger,'
 sant-qO-yatc, where saut = ' youngest' or ' last.' Again, the word expressive of the

noise made by people talking, which is snd'-nsitt, is thus resolved into two inde-

pendent radicals                                                                                               snd'  =  ' name ' or ' word,' and  nsut  =      · noise ' or                               ' sound.'  Compare
                                                                                                            :

with this the word tcS'anstit, which means ' noise ' as made by children playing

together. Numerous other examples may be found in the vocabulary.

                                                                                                                              Gendee.

Grammatical gender is not entirely wanting in the Sk'qO'mic as amongst the

N'tlaka'pamuQ. The article and the personal pronoun of the third person singular

(which, strictly speaking, is rather a demonstrative than a true pronoun) and the

possessive pronoun of the tirst person singular have distinct masculine and feminine

forms.  Thus  ts,' a,'                                                                                         or    ' the '  (masc), tlk;  ' a ' or  ' the '  (fem.)                                tai  or  te,  he' ; '  d'tU,
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

'she;' tEn, 'my' (masc); Ueh,, "my' (fern.). These possessives, monosyllabic

though they be, are compound forms derived from the articles te and He and n, the

characteristic element of the first personal pronoun. It is the same 'n or eti = ' my,'
as we find in N'tlaka'pamuQ, and which appears so constantly in the irregular' verbal

forms of the first person singular in all our Salish dialects. The usage of these

pronouns is interesting. The function of gender is peculiar. As gender is wanting

to the Sk-qo'mic substantive, there can be no agreement between the possessive and

the thing possessed, as in the classic tongues. The gender of the pronoun in any

given sentence depends entirely upon the sex of the speaker. A woman must

always say <Zk«, and a man ^£71. Thus, tlEnVdva, 'my house,' by ihe woman, and

fEH lam by the man. This is the general usage of the two forms. Even in such

instances as when the speaker uses terms which are applied exclusively to males or

females, such as ' husband,' ' wife,' ' father,' ' mother,' ' brother,' ' sister,' &.C., where

the distinct form gives a kind of gender to the word, the possessive does not agree

in gender with the substantive, as might, on the analogy of classic usage, be ex-

pected. It would be impossible for a man to say ' tlsti tcuwa'c,' my' wife,' or a
woman to say ' tsji sko',' ' my husband ; ' the combination would be ridiculous. There

is, however, an interesting exception to this general rule. Whenever a general term

expressive alike of 'male' and 'female' is employed, then both men and women

place tlEu before the word when they are speaking of a female, and tem when they

are referring to a male, thus: tlE7i weh, 'my daughter,' and tE7i viEn, ' m}' son,'

the function of the possessive here being to give the gender to the noun.

The function of the article is quite different from that of the pronoun, the form

employed in any given expression depending in no way upon the sex of the speaker.

It conforms rather to classic usage, and its gender is ' governed ' by the gender of

the noun it is qualifying. But, as I have already stated, as there is no grammatical

gender of the noun in Skqo'mic, the division into masculine and feminine terms is

rather a mental than a formal process. Of neuter forms there are none, the distinc-

tion being impossible to the Indian mind. In his conception every object in nature,

animate and inanimate, is a sentient being, possessing a character and individuality

of its own, and has therefore male or female attributes. The Sk-qo'mic child learns

to distinguish in his mind masculine 'ideas' from feminine ones just in the same

unconscious way as he learns his mother's tongue, and in ordinary discourse has no

more trouble over his article than a French child has over his. Indeed, in the

matter of concord the use of the article in the Sk qo'mic and French closely agrees,

but in Sk-qo'mic the article has usages peculiar to the language, being used in a

variety of ways unfamiliar to us in the French. For example we fiijd it in such

sentences as the following: ' netl tE Harry,' 'it is Harry;' 'netl tlE Mary,' 'it is

Mary.' It is also employed wiih the personal pronouns in certain expressions where

it seems to have a prepositional force, thus : ' hauq mekauq haua tls uns ? ' (or tu

uns, according as the ' me ' is male or female), ' Will you not come mith me 1 ' and

also with the personal and possessive pronouns generally (see under ' Pronouns '). It

is also invariably placed before proper and tribal names, closely resembling in this

respect in form and function the usage of the article in Polynesian. Besides these

grammatical distinctions of pronominal and demonstrative gender we find the

ordinary distinctions of separate words to denote male and female objects,

thus :

        sue'ka, man                                                                                                                                     stla'nai, woman

                                                                           '

500 REPORT-- 1900.

    In animal terfhs 1 could not find this distinction. When speakirig of dnimals, If

it is necessary to distingnish sex, it is done by placing modified forms of the terms

for ' man ' and ' woman' before or after the class word, thus :

sueawe'ka sk-umai', dog                              stla'tlenai sk'umai', bitch.

sQecen sueawe'ka, deer                               sQecen stla'tlenai, doe.

     In this respect the Sk-qo'mic agrees closely with the N'tlaka'pamuQ. In both
dialects it is obt^ervable that the modification of the qualifying word, though an

amplilication of it, differs from that which marks the plural. The reason of the redu-

plication here is not c'ear. There are a few terms used of male and female alike

without distinction of form in the use of which, if there is a possibility of ambiguity,

the pronominal forms tai and il'tli are added, thus :

stao'tl, child.                                                     wa'nim, orphan.

sia'atEn, widow (a'tli).                                            si'ya, lover.
      ,, widower (tai).

                                          Case.

     The Sk-qo'mlc noun agrees here with the N'tlaka'pamuQ, and ordinarily under-

goes no modification for case. In certain expressions modified forms of the
inflectional personal pronouns are added to a word to mark possession or ownership,

as in the N'tlaka'pamuQ, thus :--

mytEn, tlEn, or 'n-lara,                  house lam-tcit, our house
                                                                          ;;

tE-lam or E-lam, thy house ;              lam-yap, your house
                                                                                                                                       ;

(tE) lam-s, his house ; (tE) lam-s-wGt, their house.

     There is a very close resemblance here to the N'tlaka'pamuQ, though some of the
pronominal elements differ and the ' present ' and ' absent ' forms of the pronoun are

wanting in the Sk-qo'mic.

    The object noun when not the name of a part of the body is invariably distinct
from the verb, and undergoes no modification whatever, and commonly follows the

verb as in English, thus :

nE-qol'-nuq-ilas tEn sk-umai', ' he killed my dog ;

no' wet             yu'itl,  ' they  are  making  a             ;'

                                                     fire

me'ska tEn ya'siauk-, ' give me my hat ;

nE-hOi-nuq-uas tEn lam, ' he has completed my house.'

    When, however, the object affected by the verbal action is a personal pronoun
other than the third persons, or is a noun descriptive of a part of the speaker's body,
then the object suffers modification, and is incorporated in the verbal synthesis.
But this incorporation is of a much looser character than in the typical incorporative

tono-ues or even in the kindred dialect of the N'tlaka'pamuQ. In the latter the

incorporated object, both noun and pronoun, is placed between the stem of the verb
and the personal inflection. In Sk-qo'mic the verb stem and subject pronoun are
always found together, and the object, whether noun or pronoun, is added to these

terminally as a suffix, thus :

                             Noun Object.

    The Sk-q6mic, in common -with most of our native tongues, is rich in synonyms

and synonymous expressions. Nearly every one of the above pronominal expressions
can be otherwi.-e rendered. I append a few of these :- -

                                                        'n-tles-tcap,   I love you ;  or, again, tcin-tletcap, I love you
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

                                                        wut-tlesas, he loves me ; tcuq-uii-tle stum tE etsi-wet, they love thee

                                                        tle-sto'mi-tcan-wit, I love you ; tles-tcan-wet, I love thee.

                                                        tum-tle-etsi-tlE-nemutl, they love us.

     It will be observed that when the object is in the third person no incorporation
takes place. This is the same as in the N'tlaka'pamuQ and other dialects. This is
due to the fact that the personal pronouns for this person are yet scarcely differen-
tiated from the demonstratives from which they are derived. This is plainly seen

in the absence of a distinct and independent subject pronoun lor the third person in
the pronominal inflections of the verbs. The Salish dialects are just at that stage
of development when the formation of distinct pronominal forms for the third person
takes place. The N'tlaka'pamuQ has a partially developed subject-pronoun for its
transitive verbs, and is thus a stage in advance of the Sk qo'mic, but neither has

distinct forms for the third person for theverbumsubstantiviim or for intransitive verbs.
     It will be seen in the above incorporative nouns that the .synthetic forms differ

less from the independent forms in the Sk-qo'mic than in N'tlaka'pamuQ, and this

holds good of all the nouns. A few are derived from different roots, which it is

interesting to note are often those which belong to independent forms in others of
the Salish dialects. The Sk'qo'mic incorporative noun is generally an attenuated
form of the independent noun. It is interesting to note that in the ' face' synthesis
we have the root as it appears in the N'tlaka'pamuQ compound. It is only in com-

pounds that this radical appears in Sk-qo'uiic, and the same may be said of many
others. As I observed in my remarks on N'tlaka'pamuQ, this preference for one

synonymous form over another in the various divisions is one of the chief causes of
the lexicographical dissimilarity in the Salish dialects. If we compare, for example,

the words for ' house ' in Sk'qo'mic and N'tlaka'pamuQ, we find the vocabulary form
in the former is Idm, and in the latter icl'tvQ, of which the essential root is tuQ. I

cannot say if lam, appears in any form in N'tlaka'pamuQ, but tuQ certainly does in
various compounds in Skqo'mic, thus making it perfectly clear that this is one of
the primitive Salish roots expressive of ' house.' Thus, we have it as the sufBx in
the class numerals when counting houses: samjj-tuQ, 'two houses'; tcanau-tnQ,
' three houses,' &;c. ; also in the compound signifying ' potlatch-house,' tla'anukauiw'g.
Again, a house with carving in or upon it is called stcu'two. It is seen also in the
compound for window and other words. I have dwelt upon this point rather because

it confirms my contention that the onl}' way to institute comparisons in American

tongues is by the resolution of compound terms into their constituent primitive
radicals. Till this is done we can never know what tongues are really related and
what are not,

    All of these may be used objectively as well as subjectively. There is another

form for the third persons. I have found it only as an objective, thus :

    Te meni'tl, he; a'tli mEni'tl, she ; etsi mEnEni'tl, them. Besides these there is

an  ' absent                                            form,  thus  :
                                                     '

    Ku^, he                                             Q'tla, she.     These latter forms appear in such sentences as the follow-

is not a common form, and the regular method of marking the absence of the third
person is by prefixing the particle wk (see below).

The distinction in the possessive, marking the absence or presence of the object

seen in N'tlaka'pamuQ, is wanting in the Sk-qo'mic. In the latter dialect there is but

the one common form, but it possesses a masculine and a feminine for the first person

singular, which is unknown in N'tlaka'pamuQ. The function of this gender I have

already dealt with on p. 499. Besides tEn and tlEn we find for this person two

other forms used alike by males and females. These are seti and hSun. According

to my informants they can be used almost in any expression in the place of the regu-

lar tED and tlEn forms. I found them in such expressions as ms-qOi-nuq-fids seu

my mysk'umai', 'he killed
                   dog ; ' liuEti m.EtniiEn, '                                                sons.'

In conjunction with the verbum substantivum and a demonstrative, they are thus

expressed :

mynetl 'n lamti, this is                 house ; netl so'otl lam ti, this is our house.

,, u-lam ti, ,, thy ,,                             ,, ti lam-yap, this is your house.

   ,, lam-s ti, ,, his ,,                          ,, ,, lam s-wet, this is their house.

                   Substantive Possessive Peonouns.

These forms are used in answer to such questions as ' Whose is this ?

               netl 'n-swa,              it is mine ; netl so'otl,                                         it is ours.

     In the perfect and future tenses and in certain other constructions the tcin and
tcit of the first person singular and plural undergo a modification and change to
tcan and teat respectively.

     There are modifications of all the pronominal forms in the conditional, dnbita-
tive, desiderative, and other moods of the verb. iFor these irregular forms see

under ' Verbs.'

                   Construction of Peonouns with Verbs.

   The transitive verb forms are not in Sk-qo'mic distinct from the intransitive and
verbum substantivum forms as in N'tlaka'pamuQ. The only difference between the
two forms is in the third person, which takes the characteristic terminal -s or -es in
both numbers, and this only in the past and future tenses, thus : nE-k-o'k-Ot-iJ«, he

struck (it) ; nE-k-o'k-ot-ES-wc'i, they struck (it).
     It will be observed that the pronoun in Skqo'mic precedes the verb in regular

constructions ; in N'tlaka'pamuQ it follows it. In certain constructions the pronoun is

placed after the verb in Sk-qo'mic. When so placed a different sense is given to the
expression, thus : ' Niim-tcin tlatown ' means ' I am going to town,' but ' tcin-niim tla
town ' means, on the contrary, ' I have been to town,' or, I am going back from town.'

Again, in answering a question, it is usually suffixed ; thus in answer to the question,
' otcuq Esk'oi ? ' ' are you sick ? ' the answer would heii'd-tcan Bsk-vi, or shortly u'd-tcav
In such instances the vowel is always changed to a. This applies equally to the

plural form.

     In Sk-qO'mic there is no difference between ' this ' and ' that,' these ' and ' those,'

             Dr. Boas has recorded the form nltl as ' this,' nitl or netl, as I write it, is a com-
        pound term, and signifies ' it is ' or ' this is,' or ' that is,' ne being a form of the

I verbum substantimim. He has also recorded in his short vocabulary of the Sk-qo'mic

        in the Sixth Eeport on the North-Western Tribes of Canada, 1890, masculine and

        feminine forms for 'that,' to' nltl (masc), qu'nltl (fern.). I have been unable to dis-

         cover these myself in the Sk-qo'mic.

formed. The common cardinal numbers are :

                1. 'ntco                             The 'teens ' follow regularly.

                                                         Okdinals.

    With the exception of ' first ' and ' last ' the ordinals do not in Sk-qo'mic differ in
form from the cardinals. For ' first ' they say yawu'n, and for ' last ' they use the
term aaut or avt.

                                    Class Numerals,

              The following forms are employed when counting houses though not exclusively

so            and it would appear that the younger people use the independent  forms as often
           ;

as the composite.

                                    1 house na'tcatuQ.

For counting trees they use the following ;

                      1 tree 'ntce'wa.
                      2 trees anoso'wa.
                      3 ,, tcanBte'wa.

When counting canoes the following may be employed :                     '

                                                 1 canoe natcakoitl.
                                                  2 canoes Samakoitl.
                                                       3 ,, tcanakoltl.

     It will be observed that the method of forming the class numerals in the
Sk-qo'mic differs considerably from that employed in N'tlaka'pamuQ. I find no

instance of reduplication of the stem.

     It will also be observed that 'two,' kc, is sometimes expressed by u'nos and
sometimes by sama' or tsama'. The former of these terms is peculiar to the
Sk'qo'mic and their northern neighbours the StlatlumH, according to Dr. Boas's
hfalish Comparative Vocabulary. The latter is found in the SEQua'pmuQ of the
interior, and also among the Coast Salish. I could find no trace of either in
N'tlaka'pamuQ, where cai'a is uniformly employed to express ' two' &c.

                      Numeral Adverbs.

     These are not so regularly formed as in the N'tlaka'pamuQ, though we find the
same characteristic sufiix ' -atl ' in both, thus ;

once natcauq.                                  9 times tssEsa'tl.

twice tsama'.

thrice tcEnauq.

4 times qauEtsna'tl.

5,,  tsi'etca'tl.
6,,  t'a'qatca'tl.
7,,  t'a'qosa'tcatl.
8,,  t'qa'tcatl.

' Eleven ' appears under a strange form here.

                                               ADJECTIVES.

     The regular position of the adjective is lefore the word it qualifies, thus : tuta^t,
tE tlk-aitc, ' bright the moon;' haha'tl e'tsi siwe'Eka ' good are these men,' baha'tl
slwe'Eka e'tse, good are these men. In such phrases as ' this house is good ' and
' this is a good house,' they mark the difference thus : hatl tl ufi lam = ' this house is
good ; ' tl iia lam hatl = ' this is a good house.'

     The adiective invariably agrees in number with the qualified word, as in tlie
examples above. Comparison of the adjective is effected in the following manner :

  Positive              Comparative                                          Superlative
                                                                         nao'n hatl, best
hatl, good            {oTra^tcYatl,} moi-egootl

    The superlative is also expressed by tone, the speaker drawing out the positive
forms on a rising note much as little children do with us in English.

     Of the two forms in the comparative the former is clearly the same term as

 first ' in the ordinals ; the latter is a preposition signifying ' above,' ' over,' &c.

                                             ADVEEBS.

    The function and position of the adverb are much the same as in N'tlaka'pamuQ.
When t espresso ' time ' it is invariably placed before the verb, thus :

    Tci'atl i'm§ tce'Ek tE tlk-aitc, ' the moon will ri.se soon; ' tei'atl tcin-l-nam, ' I
must go soon; ' natcavq kuisE's me tEn lam, 'he came tp piv hoiige opce ;' fle'slc't

tcia-trd'a^nam, ' often I ussd to go,'

    The inflexion of the verb in Sk-qo'mic is effected partly by affixing particles and
partly by auxiliary verbs. These, in such sentences as we form in English with the

verhum suhstantlvum and a noun or adjective, are : present tense, w'«; past indefinite,

The Sk-qo'mic employ the regular verb of being characteristic of the Salish

dialects, the simplest and most constant form of which is v'll (see below under the

verbal inflections) ; but besides this regular form we find three others, v, no or niitl,

amand i- (this latter is also seen in the Kwakiutl). Thus : e-fcin-Estu'i, ' I                                                                    sick ;

     In ordinary speech the adjective or noun is not usually reduplicated for the plural.
In formal speech, however, the plural forms must never be omitted.

    These forms may be called the regular or classic forms. It is quite common, how-

ever, in ordinary speech to omit one or other or both of the auxiliary verbs c and
ji'ff, placing the pronoun and adjective in simple juxtaposition, thus: tcin-Esk-o'i,

tcuq-Esk-o'i, &c.

     In the third person of both numbers the form no'a or nau'a is quite commonly
used, thus: no'a Esk-o'i, 'he or she is sick;' no'a ye'yEk', 'it is snowing;' no'a
satsauq-wOt, ' they are happy ' (see other examples below).

     The difference between these two tenses is that the former merely makes a state-

ment of a past sickness without implying anything of the present condition of the
patient, while the latter signifies that the persoij was sick but h?is since recovered,
and is liow well.

Of the various particles which enter into verbal syntheses, there are two in

particular which deserve special mention. These are he and nvq. The former has

an independent existence as an adverb of place, meaning ' there.' The latter I have

not found apart from the verb. The functions of he are various, and at the outset

of my studies I found it very perplexing. It marks, like than in the N'tlaka'pamuQ,

the absence of the thing spoken of ; it marks absence in the third persons when they

are the subjects of conversation, and it marks absence in time also, both past and

future. As may be seen from the paradigms of the verbs, it is the regular sign of

the past indefinite. It occurs also in such phrases as ' next morning ' =: iiE-h od'il.

Nvq was also a source of trouble to me at first. In writing down phrases to bring

out the inflections of the traneitive verb, I found that the verb ' to strike ' {kukotEs')

was sometimes given to me as ku'kot, and sometimes as ku'kEnuq. The explanation

given me by one of my informants only misled me. She did not understand it

herself. After further study and comparison it became perfectly clear. I found

that nuq could be affixed to every transitive verb. Its functions are exceedingly

interesting. Primarily it is employed by the speaker to inform you that the action

spoken of took place without his knowledge or observation if done by yourself, and

if done by some one or something else without your knowledge or observation as

well. For example, I may desire to tell you that I have hurt my face when doing

something. If you are jaresent at the time and observed the accident I should use

the form e-tcm-maqtlos, but if you had not observed it or were not present when it

happened and I wished to tell you of it, I must then say, e-tcin-nuq-viaqtl-os. Again

if I desired to tell you that I killed ten deer yesterday when you were absent, I

must say tcin-kui-7i'uq ts OpEti, &c. Or, again, I have just been told, it may be, that

some one dear to me is dead of whose sickness or condition I was unaware. I am
sad in consequence. If I am questioned as to my sad looks I must reply tein-pEna-

miq tE a skua'lEwan, which literally rendered means, ' I have just become possessed

of a sore heart.' If my sadness had been of long standing, the cause of which was

known, I should answer tcin-c-apis tE a skua'lEwan, which signifies that ' I am

holding all the while a sore heart.' Other interesting examples may be seen in the

story of the Smai'lEtl, given below, page 512, in the Sk-qo'mic text. In the

paragraph where we are told that the girl saw the following morning that the slave

bore the imprints of her painted hands upon his shoulders, the nE-kwatc-7i«(7-iia-s

form is employed to express the surprise of the girl in learning that it was the

slave's back she had painted. She had placed her hands knowingly on her ravisher's

shoulders in the dark without knowing who he was, hence niiq was necessary here
to mark her surprise. Another good instance is seen in the paragraph which tells

of the chiefs perception of his Daughter's condition, 7ifiq bei g necessary here to
show that up to this time he had been miaware of what had taken place. A somewhat

different function is given to it in the concluding paragrapl) of the story, where the

descendants of the pair are said tn be very keen-scenttd, the term nuq-B'vEks-WKt

here literally meaning that they are alile to smell things before they can see them

or otherwise know of their presence. One of my informants gave me to understand

that  the  ' kokot                                           form  signified  an  accidental  striking,  and  that  ' k'ok  Enuq  '  implied
                                                      '

intentional or purposive action. I doubt much if this is correct, as the language

contains regular purposive and accidental particles. For example, if I desire to

say that I have been purposely struck by some one, I must use the following form of

expression                                                   'ntsa-ansas, ' he struck me with intention.'  If accidentally struck then
                                                          :

I say 'ntsa-numcis, ' he accidentally struck me.' Again, ' he struck me with a stick in-

tentionally ' is rendered by nE k-Ok-otsis ; but ' he struck me with a stick by accident
512 REPORT-- 1900.

by HE k'ok'-numcis. Another interesting distinction between accidental liurt to

myself by my own action and intentional hurt by the action of some one else is thus
marked. If I want to say I have accidentally struck my eye and hurt it, I say
tcin-tsa tEn k-ulom, but if I want to say some one else has purposely struck my eye I

must use the expression 'ntsa tEn kulOm. The difference of action is here brought
out by the use of different pronouns. iiiKn apjiended to a verb stem signifies duty or
necessity = our ' must ' or ' ought.' Before leaving the particles it will be of interest

to point out that 7w'i, the regular sign of the future in the N'tlaka'pamuQ, is seen in

the Sk'qo'mic dialect only in exhortative forms, while the Sk'qO'mic future eJi- is, as

far as I am aware, wholly absent in the N'tlaka'pamuQ.

ears till they become long and pointed, and at his arms till they equal his

legs in length. They then take the pointed bone he had been at work

upon and thrust it into one of his feet, in consequence of which this bone

(stnumk'SEn) is found in the feet of all his bestial descendants to this day.

After this they clap their hands and make a noise like a deer, and he in-

stantly loses his original form and becomes a deer, with antlers springing

from his forehead. Thus did Qais create the deer for the Sk-qo'mic. The

creature starts off in fear and runs from them with the swiftness of the

wind. When he had gone some distance he stopped and looked back,
whereupon Qais beckoned to him to return. Said the eldest : ' He runs

too fast ; the people who come after us will never be able to catch him.

We must make him go slower.' When the deer comes back to them they

take him by the hind legs and knock his hoofs together several times.

They then clap their hands again and send him oft' a second time. On

this occasion he does not run so fast. ' That will do,' said they ; ' he is all

right now.' From here they paddle on till they come to an old man who

appears to be fishing for salmon with a long double-pronged fish-spear.

He carries also a big basket with him. The Qais stop and watch his

proceedings. They find that he does not spear the salmon, but merely
feels for them and rubs his spear against them, bringing away each time

a little of the slime from their bodies. This he wipes off with some moss

into the basket. When they see what he is doing they go up to him and

take his spear away from him. From their pockets they then produce a

ml'dtc (a barbed spear-point) and put it on the spear, saying as they do

so : ' See, grandfather, this is the proper way to fish.' And as they speak

Qais feels in the water with the blunt end of the spear for the salmon,

and when he touches one he turns the spear quickly about and plunges it

into the salmon. They then return the old man his spear and tell him to
catch his salmon as they had shown him. The old man gets angry and
says : ' I don't want you to tell me what I ought to do. I like my own
method best, and I prefer the slime to the fish.' When he makes this

strange statement they are convinced that he must be a person of a very
undesirable character, who ought to be checked in his evil ways. They
therefore take his spear from him and break it in two. The two halves
they set against his legs one on each side. The point of the spear they
push up his nose. They then pull at his head till his neck is much
elongated, after which they clap their hands and utter the cries of a crane,

and the old man is immediately turned into a bird of that species and

flies away. Thus did Qais bring the crane into being.
     They continue their journeyings till they come to a high bluS" on the

sea shore. Here they land, and the youngest resumes his own form.
They now build a house for themselves and propose to stay a while there.

When the house was completed the eldest suggests the making of a trap

to catch the Sun. Said he : 'I will make a trap and snare the Sun. I

want to have a talk with him.' He then transforms his youngest brother

into a salmon, and secures him to the shore by a line ; the salmon sports
about in the water and looks a very fine fish. Presently Snu'k'um (sun)
perceives the bait set for him, and descending in the form of an eagle
pounces upon it and carries it oft", breaking the line which held the salmon
to the shoi-e as he did so. The three brothers were unconscious of what

was occurring, having been cast by Snu'k"um into a deep trance. When

they awakened from their trance their youngest brother had disappeared.
Qais was not to be beaten by Snu'k'um in this way, so he now transforms
520 KEPORT--1900.

the third brother into a whale and secures him in the same manner as the

salmon had been fastened, only with a stouter line. No very long time

after this Snu'k-um seeing the whale in the water came down and seized
it as he had the salmon. Again the two remaining brothers are cast into

a deep sleep. When the Sun had got up as far as the line permitted he

was jerked back again to the water screaming. This continued till the
brothers presently awoke. The eagle could not get away from the whale

now because his claws had become entangled in the skin. So the two
brothers pull on the line and bring the whale to the shore. Qais now said

to the Sun : ' Don't try to get away, I want to have a talk with you ; that

is why I set those traps for you.' When the Sun perceived that he had

been outwitted by Qais he consents to stay a little while and talk with

them. Qais now questions him concerning the place where the salmon
come from. Snu'kum points across the water and tells them the home of
the salmon is a long, long way off in that direction. Qais tells hiin that
he wants to go to the salmon country, and asks what he must take with
him on the journey. The Sun instructs him to gather a great quantity of
'medicine,' and take that with him and all would be well. Qais now
releases the Sun, who flies off into the clouds. Qais then set about

gathering herbs for the ' medicine ' which Snu'k-um had said was
necessary for him to take, after which he and many of his people set out

in their canoes for the salmon 'country. For many days they paddle in

the direction pointed out by Snu'k'um and finally come to an island.
This they are prevented from approaching by enormous quantities of
floating charcoal which block the progress of the canoes. One of the
young men, thinking the charcoal is compact enough to sustain him,
jumps out of the canoe upon it, but instantly sinks through and is
drowned. After much trouble they get away from the obstruction and
paddle round to the other side of the island. Here they perceive what
looks like a settlement. They see smoke of all the colours of the rainbow

rising into the clouds. This is the country they are seeking, the home of
the salmon people. They draw into the beach, which is very broad and
smooth, and leaving their canoe go forward towards the settlement, Qais

taking with him his medicine. When they arrived at the village Qais

presented the chief, whose name was Kos (spring salmon), with some of

the medicine. Now at the back of the village was a creek in which Kos

kept a tcea'k' (salmon trap), and just before Qais and his followers landed
Kos had bidden four of his young people, two youths and two maidens,
to go into the water and swim round and enter the salmon trap. Obey-
ing, they walked into the sea with their blankets drawn up over their
heads, and as soon as the water reached their faces they bacame salmon
and leaped and sported together just as the salmon do in the running
season, making their way in their frolics towards the trap in the creek.
When, therefore, Qais and his followers had landed and met the salmon
 chief, he ordered some more of his people to go to the trap and take out
 the salmon and cook them for his guests. This they did, cutting them open

and spreading them on a kind of wooden gridiron to roast. ^ When the lish

     ' This gridiron was formed as follows: A shallow trench was dug about twenty

 inches wide, the length varying with the number of fish to be roasted, in which a
 fire of dry wood was kindled. On either side of the trench stakes were driven in at
 intervals. These were about three feet high. On the top of these, and parallel
 with the trench, were then fastened slender poles, and across these again directly
 over the flames other transverse ones. On these latter the split salmon were laid
 and roasted.
             ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                                                   521

were l-eady Kos invited his guests to partake of them, begging them at the

same time to set the bones carefully aside and not lose or destroy any.

The visitors accepted the invitation and soon disposed of the cooked

salmon. After they had finished their meal some of Kos's people came

and carefully gathered the salmon bones together, which each of those

who had eaten of the fish had piled in a little heap by his side, and took

them down and threw them into the sea ; whereupon the bones were
immediately transformed back into the four young people again, who

presently came up out of the water and joined the others. The salmon

chief entertained his visitors with salmon-feasts for four successive days.

Now the care which Kos took over the salmon bones excited the curiosity

of one of Qais's followers, who, on the second day, stealthily hid and kept

back some of the head bones of the salmon he was eating. After the

meal was over the bones were gathered up as before and cast into the

water, but when the four young people came out of the water this time it

was observed that one of the youths was covering his face with his hands.

This youth went up to Kos and told him that all the bones had not been

thrown into the water, and that he was in consequence lacking the bones

of his cheek and nose. When Kos heard this he inquired among his

guests if they had thrown away any of the fish bones while eating, and

pointed out to them the condition of his young man's face. The youth
who had kept back the bones, alarmed at the consequence of his act, now

brought them forward, pretending to have just picked them up from the

ground. The day following the seagulls were seen to be gathering in

great numbers about some object that was floating on the water a little

distance from the land. Kos sends some of his young men to see what

the attraction is. They presently discover it to be the corpse of a young

man. When Kos is informed of the nature of the floating object he asks

Qais if any  of  his  party  had  been  drowned                                 Qais  answers  that  one  of
                                                                             ;

his young men had fallen into the water on the other side of the island

and been drowned. Upon hearing this, Kos bids his young men bring

the floating corpse ashore with ropes. This they do, and Qais discovers

that the seagulls have pecked out its eyes. Now although Qais had

power to restore the corpse to life, he had no power to replace the lost

eyeballs. So when he observes their absence, he asks the salmon chief

if he could supply him with new ones. Kos answers that he can, and

offers him a pair of Tsick-ai-saimon eyes. Qais tries these and finds them

too small. Kos then offers him a pair of Tsd win- saAmon eyes. But these

also are too small. The chief then hands him a pair of Kod'k-Enis-
salmon eyes, and these are found to be just the right size. Qais now

sprinkles the corpse with some of his medicine, and the young man is

immediately restored to life. On the fourth day Kos makes a great

Kld'acEn (feast), and gives to every one of his people a little of the

medicine which Qais had presented to him. They were overjoyed to

receive it, having seen its virtue exercised upon the corpse of the drowned

man. During the feast Qais spoke thus with Kos : ' I have come to visit

you for the purpose of asking you to let some of your people come to

mine. They are very poor and wretched, and have scarcely anything to

eat,' ' Very good,' replied Kos, ' I will do as you request, only you must

take care of them and be careful not to allow any of their bones to come

near a corpse.' Qais promised compliance with this request, and next

day set out with his followers on his return. To Qais the time spent

with the salmon people seemed only four days, but it was really a whole
522 EEPORT-- 1900.

year. As he was leaving Kos said, ' I and my tribe will visit you first

in the season.' ' After Kos,' said the tsuk-ai (popularly known as the

Andsockeye), ' I will come.' '  after the tsuk-ai I will arrive,' said the

tsdivin (cohoe). ' I will follow next,' said the kudk'Enis (dog-salmon).

'I will come last of all,' cried the tlau'etcin (humpback), ' and I shall not
come regularly like the others, but just now and again.'

Hence, according to Indian belief, the irregularity of the runs of the

last-named species.

    When Qais got back he assembled a great concourse of people and.

told them that for the future they would have plenty to eat ; that the

Salmon had promised to come to them every year. After this he recalls

that his youngest brother had been carried off by Snu'k'um and seeks to

learn from those present if any of them could climb up beyond the clouds
to Snu'k -urn's house. They all reply that no one could climb so far.
But among them was one cleverer and smarter than the rest, named

Tu'mtum (Wren ?). He possessed a fine bow and many arrows. He

now comes forward and says to Qais, ' I can shoot up there and make a

chain of my arrows.' Qais was delighted with the plan, and bade him

begin at once. Tu'mtum thereupon shoots an arrow into the clouds, and

they hear it strike against the sky where it remained. He shoots again,
and the second arrow lodges in the notch of the first. He continues

shooting in this way, each arrow striking and fixing itself in the last until

the chain thus formed reached to the ground. Qais now takes some of
his ' medicine ' and sprinkles it on the line of arrows, and the whole

becomes rigid and stout and strong.^

     KOd'tEii, the mouse-man, now comes forward, and offers to climb up

first. Qais consents, and be swarms up followed by To'tlum, the flea,

after whom come Me'tcin, the louse, 'Ske'Eks, the woodpecker, and the
rest of the company. When they reached the summit of the ladder they

perceive a big house. This was Snu'k-um's dwelling. They seek to

enter, but find it securely fastened and too strong to break into by main

force.

     After some consultation it is decided to leave the matter of forcing
an entrance to Koa'tEn, To'tlum, and Me'tcin. Koa'tEn sets to work
and soon gnaws himself a hole to enter by, and the other two force

themselves through a small crack in the boards. When they get inside

Snu'k'um is just getting into bed. The fleas get into his blankets and
worry him, the lice into his head and do the same, and the mice
make such a disturbance that he is unable to get to sleep. They keep
him awake tossing and turning till after midnight, and then being very
weary he falls into a deep sleep in spite of them. They bite him again
and again, but cannot wake him. Koa'tEn then opens the door to Qais
and the others. Q.iis discovers the head and bones of his brother, and

returns to the ground with them. He now sprinkles some of his

' medicine ' upon them, and his brother conies to life again.

    When he had done this he pulled down the ladder, and many of those

who were still upon it fell down and were killed. The Qais having come

together again, the youngest resumes the form of a canoe, and they

paddle away to another part of the country. On their way they come

     ' It is worthy of remark that in one of the Haida folk-tales access to the upper
regions is gained by an arrow rope constructed, as here, by shooting one arrow into
the notch of another (see Second Report of the Committee under the writer's notes
on the Haida Beliefs, &o.).
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                      523

upon a couj^le of men paddling about in a canoe. One, whose name was

TE'Ucapsuni (duck), sat in the bow, and the other who was called

Ela's (sea- cucumber) in the stern, he being the captain. Said Qais to

Wethem : ' Where are you going 1 ' TE'ltcapsum replies, '  are out

trapping,' and becomes so frightened that he immediately dives into the

sea. Qais now takes the bait the pair were using, and when TE'ltcapsum

comes to the surface some little way off throws it at him and strikes him

on the head with it. Where it struck a white spot immediately appeared.

TE'ltcapsum looked round to see what had happened, and Qais throws

a second piece at him, and hits him this time on the nose. Again a

white spot appeared. The duck now takes to flight, crying out in fear

as he goes ' anin, nin, nin, ninJ Ela's observing Qais's action now also

takes to the water and dives down to the bottom and remains there.

Qais seeing this calls out to him, ' Very well, my friend, if you want to

stay down there do,' and therewith he transforms him into a sea-

cucumber (Holothurian). Thus originated the white-headed duck and

the sea-cucumber.

     After these events they went up towards the head of the Sk-qo'mic

River. On their way they perceive a village and three Fort Douglas
men (membei's of the Stlatlumn tribe, whose territory is contiguous to

that of the Upper Sk-qo'mic), who are 'packing' something on their

backs. Qais transforms these men and their packs into three big

boulders which are to be seen at this village to this day. Going on

from thence they come to a mountain, down the slope of which they

perceive SkOd'watc (sturgeonj coming. Him also they change into stone.

A little after, as they still journeyed on, they come upon K-ivinl's (whale),

and he too is transformed by them into a rock. In course of time

they arrived at the spot where the village of ''nku'k-Efenatc now stands.
There they saw two men in their canoes. These, both men and canoes,

they turn into stone ; hence the name n'ku'k-Epenatc, which signifies the
place of the stone canoes. Some time after this they meet a man

carrying a spear. They request him to give them his weapon, but he

refuses to do so, and him they likewise turn into stone, where he may be
seen to this day with his spear in his hand. At this point my informant's
memory gave out, and he could tell me no more of the doings and trans-

formations of the Qais.

                                                                Tsai'anuk.

    There was once a man who was the father of twins. One night he

dreamt a strange dream. In his dream he was bidden to collect the

bones of all the fish that frequented the Sk-qo'mic River. He was to

place them in a box divided by partitions, a pattern of which was
shown him in his dream. The bones of each kind of fish were to be kept

separate in the divisions of the box. On awaking he set about his task.
When the box was ready he filled each division of it with the bones of

different kinds of fish, and then placed the box in a large hole of a living

tree, whose trunk he had hollowed out for the purpose. He then

covered up the aperture so that the box could not be seen. Shortly after
this he died, and from that time onward no fish came into the river.

Many years later a man chanced to pass by the tree in which the box
of fish-bones was hidden. When he approached the tree, his senses were

taken from him, and he wandered round and round the place in a kind
of trance. In this state he was shown the box hidden in the tree, and
                 '

524 HEPofiT--1900.

instructed \\?hat to do with it and its contents. Wlien he came out of
his trance, he cut away the bark which had grown over the hole
completely and took out the box and opened it. The various divisions of
the box no longer contained bones, but only a little dust. Some of this
dust got on his hands and fingers, and he took some moss and went down
to the river and washed his hands in the water with the moss. As he
washed a gale of wind arose, and little fish darted out from the moss in

hundreds. He now put the box back into the hole in the tree again and

went home. It was evening when he arrived, and his wife, who had been
alarmed at his long absence, asked him where he had been all day. Not

desiring to tell her yet of his strange adventure he said that he had gone
to the river and had fallen asleep on the bank. Early next morning he
goes down to the river where he had left the moss, and where the little
fish had so suddenly appeared, and found to his great joy that the waters
were teeming with fish, amongst which was a new kind afterwards
called tsai'aniik. It would seem that the people had been aware of the
reason of the disappearance of the fish from the river, and had a tradition
among them that they would return again some day when the dust of
the boaes, which had been hidden away by the father of the twins,

should be found and placed in the water. The man now saw from the

quantity of the fish in the river that he had truly l>rought back the

fish, and ran home and told his wife. From that time on the people of
this village had plenty of fish, which aroused the jealousy of the other
villagers, and one day the box containing the bone dust was stolen by
some one and taken to another villace. This brought about the death of
the man who had first found the box, for on its being taken from the
tree a gale arose which overwhelmed his canoe and drowned him.
From that time the people on the river every year put a little of the bone
dust in the water and never lacked fish again.

     I was unable to identify the tsai'anuk. They are a kind of small

fish like smelts or oolicans, but differ from these in that they are never
found floating dead on the water, and they come and go in a mysterious
manner. The Sk'qo'mic always regarded them as the descendants of the
twins. Twins, according to the beliefs of the Sk-qo'mic, had power over

the wind; hence the rising of the wind when the bone dust was disturbed.
If any one ate tsai'anuk and sicHivas (oolicans) at the same meal he
would drop dead, the Sk'qO'mic believed.

                    (The Son of the Bright Day.)

Long time ago a shaman named TcuIq had two daughters. One fine

day the two girls got in their canoe and went out on the water. When

they were some distance from the shore they ceased paddling and lay

down in the canoe one at each end. They then began to sing. Their

song was addressed to a certain mysterious youth who was supposed to

--live at the bottom of the water. The words of the song which they

repeated many times were as follows :

Atcina' ! AtcinI' ! Atcina' ! Kwi'na yatesi its tEm

                  Kwina'-si-a'll - - - i,

-- O Owhich, freely translated, may be rendered as follows ; '
                                                  dear !        ray I

We have been told that a handsome young man lies below ! Oh that he

would come up !

When they had been singing a little while they saw a form rising
ox THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA,                          525

tlirough the water. It was young AiEt (black cod). Said the girls to
Wehim when he came to the surface : '
                                       don't want a man like you with

big bulging eyes. You can go back again.' They sang again, and

presently Tsacile'uk (rock-cod) came up. As soon as they perceived him

they derided him, saying : ' Do you think we want a man like you ? Go
down again, you big-mouthed creature.' Rock-cod, much mortified at

their treatment of him, sank slowly to the bottom again as they continued

their song. Presently they perceived a bright and fiery form rising to

the surface. The waters glowed as if a great fire burnt beneath. ' This

must be he,' said one to the other. But when this glowing body rose to

the surface they saw it was only Tuk-to'q (red cod). The girls are angry

and disappointed as he appears, and revile poor Tuk-to'q bitterly. ' You

big-eyed, gaping-mouthed, short-waisted, ugly creature, get out of our

sight and don't come here deceiving us again.' Tiik-to'q sank slowly to

the bottom again.

And thus it was with one fish after the other that came to the surface

at their singing : each and every one the girls dismissed with scornful,

abusive words. At last came Kus, the prince of fishes (spring salmon),

but he fared no better than the rest. When they saw his graceful silvery

form come shooting tlirough the water they cried out to each other :

' This must be he. How bright and shining he is ! ' But when he got

close to the canoe they perceived that they had been mistaken. 'We

Wcdon't want you, Kos,' cried they. ' You have a black mouth.  don't

like black-mouthed men. Go away and hide your black mouth.' They

cc ontinue their singing as Kos disappears. Presently they see an arrow

{sma'al) come shooting up out of the water. As it falls back they paddle

towards it, each eager to seize it first. The younger of the sisters grasps

it first. They now sing again, and a little later a second arrow shoots up

as before. This time tlie elder sister is the first to get it. Then a third

appears in the same manner, and after that a fourth. Each sister

succeeds in getting one of these, so that they now have two arrows apiece.

They sing their song again, and presently a bow (tb'qoatc) and quiver

{iciau'q) are thrust up. These the younger of the two manages to secure

first. Once again they repeat their song, and a few moments later they

behold a golden form, bright and shining like the sun, coming up from

the lower depths. This at last is he whom they desired. He is MEn-tlE-

Saic'lF.m (Son of the Bright Day). They paddle towards him, and when

the canoe has approached near enough he springs into the centre of it.

He looks from one sister to the other to see which possesses most of his

property. Perceiving that the younger sister had most, he goes to her end

of the canoe and sits down by her side, and the girls then paddle back to

their landing. When they arrive the elder sister, who is greatly disap-

pointed and jealous of the other, springs out first and runs to her father

complaining that her sister has taken her si'ya (lover) from her. TcuIq

smiled and told lier not to distress herself, that neither of them would

have him long. It would appear that TcuIq used his two daughters as
decoys to attract young men to his house, where he wickedly destroyed

them in various ways by his shanianistic powers. The younger daughter

being well aware of this takes advantage of her sister's absence to warn

her lover of what awaited him at her father's hands. Said she to him as

they were approaching her father's dwelling : ' Take care of yourself

Myever, think you are free from danger. Another danger awaits you.

father will spread a fine handsome bear skin rug on the ground for you

to sit upon. In the hair of this skin are fixed many sharp claws of the

grisly bear (tlatla'lEm) so skilfully hidden that no one would suspect

their presence. Should any one, however, be unwary enough to throw

himself down on the skin, these claws will tear and rip him to pieces. Be

careful of yourself, therefore, when my father invites you to sit down on

this rug and avoid the claws.' MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm thanks the maiden for

her warning, but tells her not to fear for him ; that his medicine is stronger

than her father's. Before entering the house MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm filled his

clothes with pieces of rock and siones. "When they got to the door the

girl gave a sudden leap and passed safely through. MEn-tlE Saie'lEm,

observing her action, did the same, and passed through without harm to

himself ; but the door springing to after him caught the end of his quiver as

it trailed in the air and cut off the end of it. The shaman looked up and

Ahaccosted the youth thus : '  ! stuta'tl (prospective son-in-law), you have

arrived, have you 1 Come and sit down on this rug.' And with that he

shakes out a fine bearskin and spreads it on the floor. MEn-tlK-Raie'lEm

throws himself on the skin, as if he had no suspicion of its hidden dangers,

and rolls about upon it as if he sought to find the most comfortable

position, breaking off as he did so all the points of the sharp claws with

the stones he had placed inside his gai'ments. He was thus able to lie

upon the rug without harm. They talk together for a while, and then,

as night had come on, they retire to rest, MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm and his bride

occupying the same bed. Before they rose next morning she warns him

that a third trial awaits him. ' In the yard yonder,' said she, ' my father

has a big canoe he is in the course of making {tcatwi'tl). It is of rock

and not of wood. In it is a deep crevice or fissure, down which my father

will purposely drop his Qohai't (chisel) to-morrow morning and request

you to dive in and bring it out. When any one does this the crevice

closes over him and he is buried alive in the rock. I am greatly alarmed

for your safety. Hitherto no one has escaped this trap of my father's.'

The young wife is very sad and cries as she tells her husband of the danger

ahead of him. MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm bids her be of good cheer and not to be

anxious for him. ' I shall do as your father desires me,' said he ; 'his

medicine cannot hurt me.' Presently the shaman calls out to the young

man : ' Saq (son-in-law), I want you to come and get my chisel for me
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

it has dropped down a deep crack myin tcativi'tl. He got up at once,

but before leaving his wife he requests from her some stau'dk- (pipeclay) ^

which he hides upon his person. He now goes out to the old man, who

points out to him the deep crevice into which his chisel has, as he declares,

fallen. The young man takes a leap into the fissure, and as he enters he

throws the stau'ok- back over his shoulder, and the next moment the cleft

closes over him. The shaman perceiving the ataic'ok- come from the rock

imagines it to be his son-in-law's brains, Aviiich have been squeezed out by

the pressure of the rocks upon his head as they closed upon him, and goes

off laughing, saying as he went : ' I got him that time, sure.' Meanwhile

     ' Dr. G. M. Dawson obtained a .specimen of this substance from the Sk-qo'mic on
Eurrard Inlet in 1875, and found it to be a diatomaceous earth, and not true jpipe-

clay.

the youth finds himself in a kind of hollow or cave in the rock, on the

floor of which he perceives a great number of human bones, the remains

of the shaman's former victims.

     Picking up the chisel he goes to the end of the cave, which opens to

him, and he passed out with the tool in his hand. He hurries after the

old man and overtakes him before he has reached the house. ' Saq '

(father-in-law), said he, ' here is the chisel you lost.' The shaman takes

the chisel, laughs, and says : 'You beat me that time, son-in-law.' The

night following this when the others had gone to rest the shaman, who

possesses a little dog, calls the creature to him and holds converse with it

in this wise : ' I am going to transform you into a swd'kwil (loon) and

put you out on the water in the morning for my son-in-law to shoot at.

You must take care to dive when you see his arrows coming, and each

time you rise to the surface again come up farther off.' MEn-tls-Saie'lEm's

wife was still anxious and troubled for her husband's safety. Said she to

him                        ' None of our young men ever escaped from the rock-trap before, so
                        :

I do not know what mischief my father is plotting against you now. I

feel sure he will not desist from his attempts to kill you, and I am fearful
of what may befall you.' MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm comforts her by assuring her

that her father cannot really harm him, do what he will. Early next

morning the shaman takes the dog to the beach and, muttering man-ic

words over it, transforms (siuwen) it into a loon, which enters the water

near the shore and begins to swim and dive about just in front of the old

man's landing. He now returns to the house and bids his daughter wake

her husband and ask him to go to the beach and shoot a loon which is

sporting about there close to the shore. MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm gets up and

goes to the beach, taking his bow and arrows with him. His arrows have

the faculty of striking and killing whatever he shoots them at. He takes

aim at the loon and shoots. The seeming bird dives as the arrow reaches

it. To the young man's surprise the loon is not killed, only wounded, the

arrow merely breaking its flesh and passing on beyond. The youth asks

his wife to get him a second arrow. The loon having come to the surface

again, though farther off, he shoots the second arrow at it, but meets with

no better success than before, merely wounding the bird without killino'

Heit. asks for a third and yet a fourth arrow, but the loon is still alive

and passing out of sight. Perceiving now that his father-in-law was

working his medicine against him, and having shot away all his arrows '

he adopts another plan. Said he to his wife : ' Has your father got a
sgum 1 _' (big cedar pot or kettle). ' Yes,' replied she. ' Fetch it for me
and bring it down here to the beach. I will go after the loon in it.' She

did as he bade her, and he set out after the wounded loon in the tub.

He took his bow with him, and as he passed his arrows which were float-
ing on the surface he picked them up. He now shot them at the loon

again, but with the same result as before. He could only wound the loon,

which swam farther out at each shot. The old shaman had watched the

proceedings thus far without saying a word or doing anything. As the

loon and his son-in law pass from their gaze he stands up and takes his

bearskin garment, shakes it, and turns it several times and then puts it
on again. Consequent upon this action there arose forthwith a great
storm, and the wind caused the waves to rise mountain high. The youno-

wife is greatly distressed thereat, and believes that she will never see her
husband again. She continues for a while to gaze seaward, but nothing
but the mountainous billows meets her eyes, and presently she seeks the

shelter of the house, believing MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm to have been over-

whelmed by the waves. In the meantime the latter pursues and presently

comes up with the loon. This time he succeeds in killing it. As it ex-

Ahpired it barked like a dog. '  !      said  MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm,  ' now  I  under-

stand why I could not kill you before. Very well, you shall serve my

purpose now.' By this time the storm has reached him, but he is in no wise

alarmed at it. He commences to sing, and the tempest at once subsides

immediately about him. Within a certain radius the water is as calm as

a sheltered pond. As soon as he had secured the dog-loon he makes for

home again. On his way he kills a great number of ducks which the
storm had driven shorewards. He shoots so many that they overKU his

boat. He utters s'mwe'n words o\'er them and they shrink at once to a
small compass. He then fills the canoe again, after which he makes

directly for the shaman's landing-place. The tempest is still raging all

about him on every hand as before. When he reaches the shore he finds
it deserted. Everybody is indoors, having given him up for lost. He

enters the house, and when his wife perceives him she is overjoyed at his

return. He tells her he has killed the loon her father wanted and bids her

go to the s<jum and bring it up and cook it for her father. She goes down

to the landing and takes up from the bottom of the tub what appeared to

her to be a single bird. But when she held it in her hand another

appeared in its place. She picks up this also only to find the same thing

occur again and again. Presently her arms are full, and yet a bird re-

mained in the bottom of the tub. She goes to the liouse and tells her

husband. ' Take your big basket,' said he, 'and pack them up on your

back.' She does so, and when at last she has exhausted the supply tlie

house is half full of ducks. MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm now utters slilwen words

over them again, and they are reduced to apparently a few only. These

he takes and plucks and afterwards roasts them. In plucking the loon

he said to it : ' When your master takes you up to eat you I want you to
bark like a dog.' When the birds were cooked MEn-tlE-Saie'lEM made a

cedar dish and placed them upon it and laid it before the shaman, who

began at once to partake of them. When he commenced he thought he

could easily clear the dish, but as soon as he has eaten one, another

appears in its place. Presently he takes up the loon, and as he was

eating it, it barked like a dog, and the old man knew at once that his son-
in-law had outwitted him again. Said he to MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm : ' You

have beaten me again, son-iai-law.' In his greediness the shaman had

overeaten himself and now became very ill. Early next morning he calls

out to his daughter to come to him. ' I am very sick,' said he, ' and 1

want your husband to go into the woods and gather some yit-hcd'n

(salmon-berries, jRubus sp.) for me.' Now it was winter time, and not

even a green leaf could be found, much less fruit. The daughter tells
her husband what her father had requested him to do. At first he would

not get up, but lay and thought out a plan of action. This time his

patience was exhausted, and he determined to punish his wicked, selfisli

father-in-law. When he had thought out his plan he got up and requested

his wife to get him some slo'ioi (finely beaten iniier bark of the cedar,

Thuya gigantea). She gives him some. As he leaves her he tells her

not to be alarmed.  my' I am likely to be delayed in             quest,' said he.

' What your father desires is not easy of accomplishment at this season of

the year.' He directs his steps towards the forest and pushes his way

throush the thick underbush till he arrives at the foot of a mountain.
        ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA,       529

Here he comes to an open glade {sivU'weJc) where many yit-twd'nai Csal-
mon-berry bushes) are growing. He halts here, procures some bark of

the klo'lai or alder tree (Alnus rubra), and chewing this blows the juice

from his mouth upon his wad of sluwi, thus dyeing it red. But only the

outer bark is stained red, the inner remaining yellow. He now proceeds

to tie little tufts of it to the salmon-berry bushes, some of the tufts

being red and some yellow. Next he transforms these tufts of do'ivi into

salmon-berries, some of which are red and some yellow. This originated

the salmon-berry, and thus it is that the fruit of one bush is red and that

of another yellow. But the fruit was not yet ripe. To I'ipen it he needs

some assistance. So he next proceeds to call upon some of his ancestors

to help him. He invokes them in the following terms : ' Come to me,
my grandparents, and help me ripen this fruit ! ' The grandparents
whom he calls upon for this purpose are the titc-titcEuTs, or humming-

bird {Trochilus S]).), the S^k'ukumkum, or humble-bee [Bombus sp.), and

the Qit,^ or wren (Troglodytes hiemalis ?). The two former were males,

the latter a female. The bumble-bee is the first to respond to the

invocation. He buzzes round and round in the air in lessening circles
until he alights upon the salmon-berry bushes. He is followed by the

humming-bird, and he again by the wren. They all three set to work at

once to ripen the berries. He begs them not to loiter over their work,
as he wants the berries in four days at the latest. When the fourth

day arrived all the berries were ripe and ready for picking. He had

brought a small woven basket (iealeuk-) with him. This he soon filled,

putting into it only red berries. When it was full he uttered sluwe'n

words over it, and the berries immediately sank down, leaving room for

more to be added. When it was full the second time he put it aside and

makes another little receptacle from alder-bark (pia'ko). This he fills

in the same way with the yellow berries. When full he sprinkles over

the fruit some of the needles of the hemlock-spruce. As he does so

he converses with the needles and instructs them in this wise: ' Some of

you must stick to the berries, and when my father-in-law eats them you

must stay in his throat and not let him swallow you or spit you out.

You must then begin to grow, and go on growing till you come out

through the top of his head.' On the red berries he sprinkles no leaves,

intending these for his wife and sister-in-law.

    He now starts homeward after thanking his grandparents for the

help they had given him. He has not picked all the berries that were

ripened, and as he leaves he bids them enjoy what is left themselves. On

tlie aftei-noon of the fifth day he arrives home with his two baskets of

berries. He calls to his wife and says : ' Has your father any cedar-

plates  (Qdplyoitl)  1       The wife answers that he has, and brings him one.

                          '

On this he now pours out the yellow berries, some of which have the

little needles of the spruce still sticking to them. The basket of red

berries he gave to his wife and sister-in-law. He then presents the dish

of yellow berries to his father-in-law, saying as he does so, 'Here, Saq,

are the berries you desired : they have cost me some trouble to procure

for you.' The old shaman grumbled when he saw hoyf few, they seemed,

' I could eat twice that quantity,' said he. But to his surprise he finds
the fruit more than he can consume. Eat as many as he will, some still
remain on the platter. Presently he begins to cough and spit. Some of
the spruce needles have got into his throat and he cannot dislodgo them.

Between his spasms of coughing he cries out : Ah' ! son-in-law, you
have beaten me this time.' Saying this his eye (for it seems he possessed

but one) begins to start from his head, and presently a young hemlock-
spruce burst through his crown and speedily grew into a big tree.
MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm then called his wife and sister-in-law, and said to them

We' will go away and leave your wicked father now.' They forthwith

pack up their belongings and start off. When they get outside of the

house MEn-tlE-Saie'lEm gives a great kick to the back of it, and the
whole structure falls in and is transformed into a big rock with the tree
that grew from the old shaman's head still standing up, and apparently
growing out of it.

     This boulder, which the Indians used to look upon as an enchanted

rock, is said to be situated near Nanaimo. Even now the older Indians

believe that the shaman is still shut up in it. They declai'e they can

sometimes hear him saying, ' You have beaten me this time, son-in-law,'

and if any one passing by on the water were to revile it, or call it
opprobrious names, such as ' old one-eye,' they believe a tempest similar
to that the old shaman brought upon MEn-tlE-Saie'lEtn when he went
after the loon would immediately arise and drown all in the canoe.

    From the fact that this rock is situated within the borders of the
SnamaimuQ, as well as from the hero's name being doubtful Sk-qo'mic,

it is pretty certain this story has been borrowed from the SnamaimuQ.

                                Te Qoitcita'l, tJie Seiyent- slayer.

   A long time ago many people lived at Stamis, a village at the mouth

of the Sk'qo'mic River. The son of the chief had just been married.
The night following the marriage, just before daybreak, the old people

heard the cry of Te Sino'tlkai (a huge double-headed water-serpent) as he
passed from one side of the mountain to the other. The old people woke
up the young couple who were sleeping together by tlu-owing cold water
over them, and told the young man that he ought to get up and go after
the Sino'tlkai. The youth was deeply oQended at this treatment on his

wedding night, and would not at first stir ; but presently he said to his
wife, ' I will do what they wish. I will follow the Sino'tlkai and kill it.

Don't be alarmed during my absence. I shall be away only four days.'
He was really absent four years, though the years seemed to him as

days. So he got up and took his bow and arrows and blanket and went

after the serpent. When he came upon the creature's trail the stench

which it had left behind it in its passage was so terrible, and the buzzing
of the flies whicli the smell had attracted so annoying, that he was
obliged to keep some distance off. From time to time as he went along
he bathed himself. After a while he came upon the serpent, which was
lying lengthwise across a small lake. Its heads rose up on one side, and
its tail on the other. Qoitcita'l would not bathe in this lake where the
serpent lay, but sought out another spot a little way off. The serpent
stayed here testing the lake's capacity for the space of two whole days
as it seemed to Qoitcita'l. In reality a whole year thus passed away.

It then went on again followed by Qoitcita'l as before, who bathed
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  531

himself frequently as he went along. They came to several other small

lakes, all of which the serpent tried as before, but none of them was

big enough for its purpose. Thus the third year passed, which to

Qoitclta'l seemed as another day. At last the serpent came to a lake
large enough for it to swim about in. Into this the Sino'tlkai dived. On

the edge of the lake Qoitcita'l built himself a house and watched the

serpent which from time to time came to the surface of the water to

disport itself. One night Qoitcita'l dreamt that he killed the serpent

with a big heavy spear made of resinous pine-wood. In his dream he

seemed to be in a large canoe, and he possessed two of these heavy

spears. So when he awoke he built himself a canoe, and made a couple

of spears after the fashion of those he had seen in his dream. When he

had finished his canoe he launched it on the lake. The serpent was not

visible at the time, so he allowed the canoe to drift about as it would.

By-and-by the serpent came to the surface again at some little distance

from Qoitclta'l. He at once paddled quietly towards it. The serpent's

two large heads were now raised in the air with its great mouths agape.

When it opened its mouths it was like the opening of two fiery ovens
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and the cries it made on these occasions were exceedingly terrifying.

Qoitcita'l paddled towards the nearest of the heads and struck it. just

at the junction of the neck with one of his spears which remained sticking

in it. He then hastily paddled towards the other and did the same with

it, and the serpent sank to the bottom of the lake. Qoitclta'l there-

upon went into a trance and remained in that condition for some time.

While he was in this state the water of the lake rose up and carried hira

to the top of a high mountain. When he came out of his trance, in

which he had learnt many secrets and much strange knowledge, he

looked intently at the water which immediately began to sink, and in

a little while the whole lake was dry. He now descended the mountain

and got down to the bed of the lake across which he perceived, stretching

from side to side, the trail of the serpent's bones. These were now clean
and free from flesh, and some of them were curiously shaped. Some

had the form of swords, and some of blanket-pins or brooches. He took

--possession of two of these one of the sword kind and one of the brooch

kind--and returned to his house on the edge of the lake. Having now

accomplished his task he determined to return home. He accordingly

 sets his face homewards. To get home he had first to pass over many
 mountains and rivers. One day he perceived a flock of mountain- sheep
 on a ridge before him. Thereupon he takes his new sword, which

 possessed magic properties, and waves it in the air, and all the sheep

 straightway fall down dead. He now skins them all, and dries their
 hides. When they are dried he packs them up and takes them with

 him. There are many hundreds of them, but his magic enables him to
 carry them all easily. As he journeyed on he came to a certain mountain
 which it was necessary for him to cross But his passage over this was
 hindered by the presence of a huge snail which barred his way whenever

 he sought to cross it. He tried every means to pass this creature, but

 always failed. At last it occurred to him to use the Sino'tlkai-bone

 brooch, which like the sword possessed magic properties. He now points

 this at the snail, and it immediately shrivels up like a green leaf in the

 fire, and dies. At last after much travelling he comes to the head of
 the Sk'qo'mic River, at the mouth of which his own village is situated.
 BetAveen the head and the mouth of the river there are many o'kwumHq,

or villages, which he has to pass on his way. The first village was on the

side of the river opposite to his own. When he got over against it

he covered himself with a white blanket and sat down to rest and

await events. The people of the village soon perceive him and cry out

to one a.nother wondering what the strange white oJaject is. Said one to

the other, ' Let us go and see what this white thing is on the other side

of the river.' They all come down to the river's edge. Qoitcita'l now

stands up and waves his magic sword in tlie air, and all the people

shrivel up as the snail had done, and fall down dead. He now crossed

over the river and took a Qok'u'lstEii, or large basket used for gathering

herbs, and filled this with the leaves of certain plants and herbs. He

then broke these up and bruised them, and made therefrom some

powerful medicine the magic properties of which he had learned in his

trance. With this he sprinkles all the dead, and they are immediately

restored to life again. After this the people take a number of canoes

and construct from them a large raft. On this they place Qoitcita'l and

present him with a great number of blankets. They also give him one of

the girls of the village for a wife. Qoitcita'l accompanied by some of the

people of the village now goes down the river. At every village they

come to Qoitcita'l kills all the inhabitants by waving his sword as he

had done at the first place, and afterwards restores them to life. At

each stopping- place he is presented with many gifts, and a girl for wife,

and  some  of  the  people  accompany  him                     so  that  by  the  time  he  has

reached his own village the raft is loaded with people and presents, and

he possesses nearly two score wives. ^ When he arrived at Sta'mis he

does the same there as at all the other places and kills everybody, his

own parents and first wife included. Then he brings them all back again

Heto life except his wife.  does this to impress the people Avith his

power. His wife had taken another husband, and so to punish her for

her want of trust in him he would not restore her to life. He now takes

Aall his new wives and presents into his father's big house.                            great

feast is then held and all the visitors are generously entertained for

many days. There was no scarcity of food or game, for Qoitcita'l had

only to go into the woods and wave his magic sword before him and

everything immediately fell dead at his feet. From this time on Qoitcita'l

became a great man and the chief of his d'kwumuq.

                              Te Sdoqivd'otl, or the Deserted Youth.

   A youth was once undergoing his h-v:aiija sut, or training for medicine-

man. He had led an isolated life in the forest, according to the custom
of novices, for some time, and had eaten no food for several days. Now

it happened that just at this time there was a scarcity of food in the
village to which he belonged, and a party of girls had gone into the
woods to dig Snotluk' (Pteris aquilina) for food for themselves. They
had secured some roots and had roasted and eaten them in the woods,
throwing aside the hard cores.^

     As the youth was wandering round in the woods he came upon the

     ' Wives acquired in this way are called b}- a special name to distinguish them
from those obtained in the ordinary manner. This term is Amitla,'ntEm, and means

' presented ' or ' freely given.'

spot where the girls had roasted their fern-roots. All around him lay

the discarded cores. The sight of these was too much for the young

man's hungry stomach, and he sought to appease his cravings for food by
gnawing at some of them. This occurred towards the end of his ti'aining.

When he had completed his k-waiyd'sot he returned to the village. Now

when the elders of the village learnt that the girls had been in the woods

roasting SQo'tluk- near where the youth was undergoing his training it

entered their minds that he might break his fast upon the remains of
their meal. So when he returned home his parents undertook to test
him. They did this by di-awing scarifying knives all over his body. In
the process one of the fern-root cores was drawn out of his flesh, at sight

of which his father was shocked and scandalised. He informs the people

of his discovery, telling them he is greatly ashamed and grieved at his

son's wicked deception. It is decided that he must go back to the woods
and go through the whole procedure from beginning to end over again.
So he returns to the training-ground and enters upon a second course of

fasting and exercise. No one expresses any sorrow for the youth except

his old grandmother, who cries when she learns that he is sent back in

disgrace to repeat his trying ordeal once more. Among the pei'sonal
belongings of the young man was a little dog which was much attached

to him. This dog the old grandmother called to her side one day, and
told it that the people had determined to go away from the village and
abandon her grandson, who had disgraced them by breaking his fast

during his kwaiya'sot. ' When your master returns,' said she to the dog,
' he will find the village deserted and all the fires out. I am A'ery sorry

for him and want to help him all I can. I intend to keep all the cores of

my Sqo'tluk and make them into charcoal and bury it in a big clam-shell,
and when my grandson returns you can tell him where to find it, so that
he will not be without fire.' You must stay behind when the people go,
and wait for your master and do as I instruct you. When I have buried

it I will show you the spot.'

    It was as the old woman had told the dog. The whole village felt
that they could not harbour a youth who had brought such shame upon

them, and so, at the suggestion of Sk-auk-, the Raven, they determined to
go away to another camp and leave the youth to his own resources. To
make their desertion of him the more complete and exemplary, when they
are ready to start they take water and pour it upon all the fires and so
put them dead out. Just before they did this the old grandmother, unob-
served by any one, converted her fern-root cores into charcoal and buried

it in a clam-shell near one of the posts of the dwelling, and bade the dog,
which was observing her, remember where to bid his master look for it.

They all now go away, taking their belongings with them, the little dog
alone remaining behind. Some time afterwards the youth, having com-

pleted his course of training, returns once more to his home. When he

perceives the abandoned state of the village he quickly comprehends what
has happened, and walks up and down, crying, feeling heart-broken at
their desertion of him. His little dog tried again and again to attract his

scarcity and famine the Indians had frequent recourse to these roots, and dug up
and ate large quantities of them, the old people and children having little else
indeed to subsist upon.

        It would appear from the precaution here taken by the old grandmother that
the preservation of fire was a matter of supreme importance in the early days of the

tribe, and the procuring of it afresh a task of much difficulty and trouble.
534 REPORT-- 1900.

attention and lead him to the spot where the buried cores were smoulder-
ing in the clam-shell ; but for a long time his master would take no notice
of him. Presently, when his grief had somewhat subsided, the importunity
of the dog and its unusual behaviour aroused his attention. For the dog,
on perceiving that it had at length attracted its master's notice, had run
to the foot of the post where the fire was secreted and begun vigorously
scratching there, looking up at its master the while and barking excitedly.

Said the youth to himself : ' I believe my grandmother has buried some-
thing there for me.' He then went to the spot and speedily discovered
the hidden charcoal, with which he soon made himself a big lire. He

now made a bow and some arrows for himself, and shot many small birds
and chipmunks {Tcmiias striatus), and from the skin of these, when dry,
he made himself a garment to cover his nakedness. ^ After this he makes

a big box in front of the house, in which he sits and looks about him.
     One morning just about sunrise he is sitting with his gay robe wrapped

about him, when he perceives the Sun coming down to him. When his

visitor got near he said to SQoqwa'otl : ' That's a fine coat you have on.

I would like to make an exchange with you. My garment has magic

qualities, and whoever wears it need never want for food.' 'All right,'

said the youth, ' I'll exchange with you. I am badly in want of a coat

of that kind just now.' The exchange is forthwith made, and each puts
on the other's garment. Then, said the Sun to the youth, ' If you dip

one corner of my cloak in the water when you want something to eat, you

will always be able to obtain any amount of slau'it (herrings). Be
careful not to dip too much of the garment in, or the fish will choke the
stream.' After this the Sun returned to his own country, carrying with
him the youth's cloak. On the morrow SQoqwa'otl goes down to the

water to try the ' medicine ' of his new garment. He dips one corner in

as the Sun had instructed him, and immediately the water swarmed with

--fine fat herrings. He straightway makes a tli'taniEn a kind of rake, on

the spikes of which the fish are impaled as it is drawn through the water.
With this he catches great quantities of the fish, after which he threads

them on strings and hangs them up to dry. He continues at his task till

he has filled his father's house with them. In like manner he then pro-

ceeds to fill the houses of all tlie others in the village except Sk-auk- the

Raven's. He had become aware by some means that the proposition to

desert him originated with the Raven, so he would not give him any

herrings. On the contrary, he filled his house with the stinking, rotting
entrails of the fish he had cleaned, by way of taking his revenge upon
him. When he had stocked all the houses with dried herrings, K'ldk-a,

the Crow, paid a visit to the village one day, and, being hungry, soon dis-

covered the entrails of the herrings and began eating them. When

Sqoqwa'otl jiereeived the Crow, he asked him if he knew where the people

of his village had settled, and whether he had seen his grandmother.

, Yes,' answered the Crow, 'I know where your people went. They are

living on the other side of the water, and every day I hear your grand-

mother crying for you.' ' Ah ! 'said the youth, 'I am sorry for my grand-

mother, and I want you to take these four herrings and give them to her,
when she is outside and nobody is looking, and tell her to come over here,
where there is laow plenty of food. I know they haven't much over

there.' The Crow undertook to do as the youth requested, and started off

on his mission. He finds the old woman sitting in the bow of a canoe
crying to herself. He alights on the edge of the canoe and cries out to

her in the following words : ' K'ciq, k-dq, ts tcatcEld'tltEn ts uni-mun-mats,
-- Hekdq ' ' Plenty, plenty food where your grandson is, plenty.'
                                                                                          then

disgorges the four herrings which he had carried in his gullet. The old

woman quickly comprehends the message her grandson had sent by the
Crow, secretes the fish on her person, and goes home. At night, when all
were abed and, as she supposed, asleep, the old woman approached the

fire and in the shadow of the big night log - produced the herrings and

began to roast them over the embers. She thought that no one would

observe  her at  this  time                          but  it  so  happened  that  one of  the children
                                                  ;

woke up and saw her. The child lay near the father's head, which was

raised some little distance from the bed by the head-rest, thus leaving a

space between his neck and the bed. Looking through this space, the

child observed the grandmother cooking and eating her herrings. She

presently roused her father and told him what the old woman was doing.

The savoury smell had by this time filled the whole building and aroused

everybody. The father demands from the old woman how she came by

the herrings she had been stealthily cooking. At first she made no reply,

and he had to ask her the same question three times before she would

respond. She then told him that the fish came from her deserted grand-

son, and that the Crow had brought them to her that afternoon with the

message that there were plenty more at the old village. On the following

morning the chief calls all the people together and tells them of the herring

incident, and that his son whom they had deserted was living at the old

Hevillage in plenty.   proposes that they shall all return thither, as food

is scarce in their present quarters. It was agreed that they all return.

So they started ofi" for their old ukioumuq in their canoes and in due time

arrived at the landing-places. They came in single file, one canoe behind

another. As they drew near the shore, the youth donned his wonder-

working cloak. To those appi'oaching he now had the glorious, resplen-

dent appearance of the noonday sun. They could not look upon him as

he sat in front of his dwelling for the dazzling splendour of his garment.

Before they landed, those who had kEmkd'mai (daughters) dressed them

in their best and gayest blankets, for the purpose of presenting them to

the youth as wives. Among these was Raven, who had two daughters.

These he not only dressed in their best blankets, but also painted their

foreheads. Presently, when all were ready, they landed, and the chief led

forward his daughter and offered her to the young Shaman as his wife.

The others in turn did likewise, Raven among the rest. He accepts all

but Raven's daughters. These he scornfully rejects, and tells Raven to

keep them, that he doesn't want them, and will have nothing to do with

them. He then bade the people go to their old dwellings and they would

find plenty of food awaiting them there. His many wives he takes to his

own house. When Raven and his rejected daughters arrive at their home

origin, hence the difference in the form of the expression. I called my informant's

attention to this, but his explanation was that this was the crow's way of talking.

they find it full o£ the stinking entrails of the fish with which SQoqwa'otl
had filled their neighbours' dwellings. They are so hungry that they are

fain to appease the cravings of their stomach by eating the foetid mass.
Thus did SQoqwa'otl revenge himself upon Raven for his part in the

people's desertion of him.

    When everybody had once more assembled about his dwelling

SQoqwa'otl invites them to come down to the water's edge with him.
Upon their arrival there he turns his cloak about and dips one corner of
it into the water, and immediately the spot teems with fish. At first the

people are too astonished to seize the fish, but presently they fill their

canoes with them. From that time onward the people of this village

never lacked for food, and SQoqwa'otl's cloak brought him much honour
and renown, and he became a great man among them.

               SmEna'tl, or the Story of the Chiefs Daughter.

     The chief of a certain large village once possessed a big dog. This

dog was not a common dog. He was really a wizard, who had assumed

this form for evil purposes of his own, though no one in the village was

aware of the fact. One night he stole to the bed of the chief's daughter

and ravished her in her sleep. When some little time had passed the

girl found herself with child without any knowledge of the person who

had brought this shame upon her. Suspecting that her ravisher would

visit her again, she takes some red paint and mountain-sheep's tallow, and,

mixing the two into a paste, smears the palms of her hands with it.

Before she has discovered the author of her trouble her father perceives

her condition and questions her concerning it. She is unable to give him

any satisfactory explanation, and he is much grieved and ashamed. The

following night the dog- wizard visits her again, but before he leaves her

on this occasion she presses her paint-smeared hand upon his shoulders.

In the morning, when all the young men of the tribe are engaged in their

exercise on the village ground, she scrutinises their backs and shoulders

to see if any of them bear the imprint of her hands in red paint. She

passes them all in review before her, but cannot perceive the sign she is

looking for on any of them. The evening of that same day the dog is

lying before the fire, and the girl, wishing to occupy the dog's place, takes

a stick and tries to drive it away. At first the dog will not stir, but

eventually it consents to get up and move off. As it does so, she is greatly

surprised to see marked upon its shoulders the imprint of a pair of hands

in red paint.  In her astonishment she cries out,  myOh'                      father, I  have
                                                                           !

discovered my ravisher. Look at the dog's shoulders ; it must be he.'

The father looks at the dog and perceives the paint-marks upon his back.

' Very well, daughter,' said he ; 'if that is the father of your child you
cannot live with me any longer.' Thei-eupon the chief goes some little dis-

tance from the village and builds his daughter a house apart by itself. When

it is ready he sends her to live there. The chief is greatly ashamed ; and
when later his daughter gives birth to twelve puppies he is so deeply

mortified by the whole circumstance that he calls his people together and

tells them that he wishes to go away out of sight and sound of his dis-

graced daughter and her unnatural offspring, and proposes a change of

settlement. They agree to his plan, and presently all pack up their

belongings, take their canoes, and paddle away to a near village. Near

their old settlement is a point of i land or promontory [Sk-'utuks-sn, cf.

radical for nose) stretching out some way into the water and hiding the
ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  537

view beyond. They determine to settle beyond this point, -where they

will be out of sight of their old camp. In the meantime the poor deserted

girl does the best she can in her lonely state for her strange family. Of

the twelve puppies two only are females, all the rest are males. When

they are old enough to run about the mother returns with them to her

father's house in the abandoned village. One evening she split some

pitch-wood for torches, and, lighting one of these, she went down to the

beach to dig for clams. She had not long been engaged at her task when

she heard sounds of singing and dancing coming from the village. She

rushes back to see what it all means, and as she nears her own dwelling

perceives the sounds to come from it. At the door one of the two young

bitches is standing. AVhen the latter sees her mother approaching she

warns the others within the house, and the sounds at once cease. The

mother's suspicions are, however, roused, and when she enters the house

she asks them who had been singing. She gets no response to her question

from the puppies, who are now speechless. She is sure, however, she

had heard the sound of human voices, which indeed she had, for her

progeny partook of the wizard-nature of their father, and had the power

to throw off their dog-natures at will. This they had done in their

mother's absence, and had sung and danced to the following words : ' Our

mother thinks we are dogs, but we know better.' This they repeated

many times. As soon as the sister who was watching informed them

that their mother was returning they stopped their singing and dancing,

put on their dog-skin coverings, which they had thrown aside for the

occasion, and resumed the form and character of puppies once more.

Hence when their mother questioned them they made no response. After

looking round the place she returned to her work on the beach. This

time she took a mat with her. When she got to the beach she

stuck the torch in the mud and made to go on with her digging as

before. Her intention was, however, to return to the house unobserved,

and learn if possible the meaning of the dancing and singing she had

heard before, and which now began again as soon as she had got to the

beach. To this end she took her shdq (clam-digger) and, planting it

firmly in the ground behind the flaming torch, hung upon it tiie mat she

had brought for the purpose, thus shutting off the light from the village,

and causing a line of shadow to appear between the beach and the house.

Under cover of this she stealthily makes her way back to her dwelling.

She sees one of the bitches standing in the doorway as before, but, being

in the deep shadow of the mat, she herself is not seen by the watcher.

She is thus able to get close to the building. She steals round behind it

and peeps in through some chink in the wall, and is greatly astonished to

see all her children, except the watcher at the door, in human guise, with

their dog-raiment thrown aside. She enters suddenly from the rear,' and

before they are aware of her presence, pounces upon their dog-garments

and casts them into the fire, where they are quickly consumed. Thus she

breaks the wizard's charm and overcomes his ' medicine,' and her children

retain thereafter their human form. She now reproaches them for the

deception they had practised upon her. ' It is entirely due to you and

your dog disguises,' said she, ' that I have been deserted by all my people

myand left in  present forlorn condition.' They all listen in silence for

     ' As the old houses had but one door or means of ingress and egress, this entrance

on the part of the mother from behind is not clear. My narrator was himself avi are

of this discrepancy, but was unable to explain it.

some time, and then the eldest boy says they are sorry for her and will

now help her and make her happy and comfortable. O' mother ! ' said he,

' I know what I will do for you : I will become a great hunter and kill

lots of mountain-goats for you.' The second then chimes in ' O mother !

I know what I will do : I will build you a nice house with carved posts

(Stutna). The third then says, ' O mother ! I will become a great fisher

and catch lots of whales and seals, <fcc.' In like manner each declares in

turn what he intends to do for her. The fourth would be a canoe-builder

and build them all canoes. The fifth a bear-hunter and bring them many

bear-skins. The sixth a song-maker and dancer and make songs and

dances. The seventh a bird-hunter and bring home many birds. The

eighth a transformer (suiwe'n) and wonder-worker. The ninth would be

a great chief and look after everything belonging to the village. The

--tenth would do a little of everything in short, would become a ' Jack-of-

ull-trades.' The mother listened to them all without making any remark.

The two girls now chimed in, and the elder declared that she would be a

great basket-maker and make all kinds of baskets for her mother ; and
the younger, that she would be a berry and root gatherer and keep

the house supplied with berries and roots. The day following they

undertook the special task they had allotted themselves. The hunters

brought home their different kinds of games and presented it to their

mother, while each of the others presented her with some specimen of

their craft or handiwork. From this time onward they lived in comfort and

happiness. One day the mother, fearing they might on some occasion go

round the point of land and come in contact with her former associates

and friends, with whom she now desired to have no dealings, warned

them never to go in that direction or they would get into trouble and

danger. This caution served but to awaken their curiosity, and one day,

when they wei'e out on the water in their canoes, one of them remarked to

the others, ' I believe that village round the point belongs to our mother's

people ; let us go round and see.' The others agreeing, they make for

their grandfather's settlement. It was then early in the day, and in

their canoes they had many seal which the fisher brother had caught that

morning. When they had got round the point they perceived an old man

sitting on the beach. They direct their canoes towards him and land

close by. The old man observed their movements, but did not speak to

Wethem. Presently one of them accosts him in these words : '  think

our grandfather lives here and we have come over to see ; can you tell
us ? ' The old man then asks them where they come from. They tell

him, from behind the point, where they live alone with their mother. The

old man, who is really the chief, their grandfather, perceived at once that

they must be his daughter's children who were born as puppies, and

declares himself to them, telling them he is their grandfather whom they

are seeking. They are glad to learn this, and present him with all the

seals they had brought in their canoes. The old chief now calls some of

his people and instructs them to unload the visitors' canoes and bring the

Heseals up to his house.  is feeling very joyful and happy (tsa'stauq).

' Come into my house, grandchildren,' said he to his grandsons, ' and let

me tell my people of your arrival.' They follow him into his big house,

where the rest of the people soon assemble. The old man presently

informs them that the strangers are his grandsons, the children of his

deserted daughter, and proposes that they shall all go back to the old

settlement. The idea is accepted, and he tells his grandsons that they

      will return to the old village, and will arrive there with all their belong-

     ings early next morning. The young men then bid him good-bye, and set

      out to return to their mother to tell her the news. It is late in the day
     when they arrive, and their long and unusual absence has caused her
     much worry and anxiety. She has almost given them up for lost when
     they are seen approaching the landing. She questions them concerning
     their delay, and learns that they have visited her father and given him

I all their seals (d'suq), and that he and all the rest are coming back to
     occupy their old quarters on the morrow. Next morning, while they are
     busy preparing to receive them, the son, who was a sluwe'n, said to his
     mother : 'What will you do to the people to-morrow, mother? I know
    what I shall do to make them feel my power.' His mother made no reply,
     but, knowing her son's wonder-working abilities, she was curious to see
     what he would do. Presently the canoes were seen approaching the chief
    landing-place. When they were almost near enough to land, the sluwe'n
     began to exercise his magic power, and caused a strong out-flowing
     current to take the canoes and carry them far out into the gulf and then
     bring them back again. This he did four times before he would allow them

I to land, and it was evening when they left their canoes. The sons now
     make their mother sit down in the foreground of the village on an elevated
     seat and pile up heaps of blankets by her side. The sixth son then opened
     the reception ceremonies with special songs and dances. In the first
   --dance two bears appear one a cinnamon {k'tlaluin) and the other a black
     bear (miaqutl). This was a bear dance. These are followed by mountain-
     goats, after which all the brothers dance and sing together. The second
    brother, who was skilled in carving, danced in a mask of his own carving. '^
     The visitors, who had remained in their canoes, looked on, and pronounced

     the entertainment a great success and the character-dancing very fine.

     After these performances are over the people land, bring up their belong-

    ings, and occupy their old quarters in the village. From this time

     onward they live together in amity, and the ten brothers are accorded
     by genei'al consent the rank of chiefs.^

     Once there were two brothers named A'tsaian and Cukguklako's.
Each one had six sons. All the sons were fine tall men except one.
The youngest son of Cuk9uklako's was somewhat deformed, having a
large protuberance on one side of his stomach. One day all twelve of
the youths started off into the mountains. They climbed three successive

dramatic entertainments of the kind described in this story, which has apparently
been evolved from the tribal consciousness to account for the origin of these particu-

     - The bestowal of the rank of chiefs as a mark of honour and esteem upon the

myten sons of the chief's daughter, as here related, bears out the statements of

--informants on social customs viz. that children of a chief's daughter take the rank

of their father. Although their mother was a smend'tl or ' princess,' they could not
take her rank, as their father was of inferior birth. The conferring of this special
privilege upon the wizard's sons shows us also, however, that men of inferior class,
by possession and exercise of superior natural gifts, or by the performance of public
services, could upon occasion be elevated by tribal consent to the rank of chiefs, as
in the case of Te SQoqwa'otl, the hero of the story of that name.

mountains, anrl after they had passed the third they saw in the distance

before them, on the brow of the opposite slope, a strange o'kwumuq

(village). As they stood regarding it and wondering what people lived

there, they presently observed a man rolling a big copper ring down the

mountain-slojje opposite them, and, as soon as it had reached the bottom,

drawing it back again with his breath. When they saw this beautiful

ring, which glinted and shone in the sunlight, they determined to possess

themselves^ of it. To this end they adopted the following plan : The

eldest of A'tsaian's sons was to go down into the valley to the spot

where the ring stopped, and seize it when next it came down. The

brother next to him was to follow after, but was not to go so far. All

the rest were to do likewise, each being some little distance from the

other, the deformed youth being last and consequently nearest home.

They adopted this plan to make sure of securing the ring, being all

quite well aware that its owner would not lightly part with it, and

Athat the attempt might end disastrously for some of them.  little

while after each had taken his place the ring came rolling down the

hill again. As soon as it reached the bottom, the youth stationed there

sprang out of his hiding-place and caught it up and immediately ran

towards his next brother with it. As he ran he found himself impeded

in his movements by the breath of the man who was pulling the ring

back again, and he had great difficulty in getting along. The owner of

the ring perceived that something had gone amiss with it, and came

down to see what was the matter. He soon discovered the youth

struggling off with his ring, and straightway made after him to recover

his treasure. By this time the young man had reached the spot where

his second brother was hiding, and just as the wizard was about to seize

him he threw it to this brother, who immediately ran with it towards the

next. Eeing fresh, this one made a good start, the more so as the wizard

stopped to punish his brother by cutting out his heart. This he ate as

the youth fell dead at his feet. He then started after the other, and

came up to him just as he got to the next brother and passed the ring

on to him. This one met the same fate as his elder brother, and like-

wise had his heart cut out and eaten. And thus it was with all of them

except the last, who, as soon as he obtained possession of the ring, took

the lump which caused his deformity from his side and threw it at the

wizard. ThereujDon a dense fog arose, and while his pursuer tried in vain

to find him he hasteiaed hoiiiewards, recrossed the three intervening

mountains safely, and presently got near the village. As he^ approached,

he called out to his father Cuk9uklako's and to his uncle A'tsaian that

all his brothers and cousins were killed. His father and uncle were in

the house at the time, and when they heard him shouting they climbed

up through the smoke-hole ' to the roof to hear what it was he was

saying. As soon as they understood the full import of his terrible news

they threw themselves down into the fire to mark their deep grief,^

whereupon their eyes shot out like fiery sparks and went, the I'ight ones

northwards, and the left ones southwards. Immediately upon this the

day became clear and fine. The youth now enters the house and relates
his own and his brothers' and cousins' adventures, and displays the
wonderful copper ring. A'tsaian takes the ring from the lad, and says :
' I know what we will do with this hoop. I will hammer it down thin

into a copper cloth for armour.' He therewith takes the ring and

hammers it down till it is as thin as a piece of cloth. They now

determine to go over the mountains to the strange village and have

their revenge upon the wizard. A'tsaian wraps the copper cloth ^ about

his body and fastens upon his head a pair of mountain- sheep horns, and
thus equipped they all tliree start out. They make for a cliff opposite

the wizard's village. When they have reached this spot Cuk9uklako's

and his son hide themselves, while A'tsaian walks to and fro on the

edge of the cliff on all-fours as if he were a mountain-sheep grazing on

the herbage. He is soon discovered by the wizard, who, taking him for

a sheep, tires his arrows at him. The copper covering A'tsaian has on
prevents the arrows from piercing or injuring him. After the wizard
had shot all his arrows he climbed the cliff to see why the sheejD had not

fallen. He walks backwards and forwards upon the brow of the cliff
picking up his arrows. As he does this, A'tsaian runs at him and prods

him with his horns, and finally pushes him over the cliff so that he falls
down and is killed. Cuk^uklakO's and his son now come out of their
hiding-place, and the three descend the cliff to where the wizard's body is
lying. They now proceed to cut him open, and inside they find the

eleven hearts of their dead children. These they take and convey to
their original places in the bodies of their sons. They then make some
powerful medicine and restore the youths to life again, after which they

all proceed home. When they reach their own village, A'tsaian converts
the copper cloth into the figure of a boy, whom by the utterance of

magic words he presently brings to life. This boy grows into a powerful

man and becomes a great and famous hunter. Being made from copper
gives him a decided advantage over other men, for, however much he
falls or is knocked about, he is never hurt or injured. He is known by
the name Saeils.

               Te Skaul", the Baven.

Once upon a time Raven lived by himself in a village of his own.

Near by his dwelling was a stream in which he bad set his salmon-trap.

One day, on going to the trap, he found a fine salmon in it. When he

took it home, and was cutting it open, he perceived that it contained two

tlkoi (milt, or soft roe). He is delighted, and dances about with joy and

Ka Kacries! !  Says he now to himself, ' They shall be my wives.'  He

hangs the tlkoi upon the beams of his house, but cooks and eats the

salmon, leaving only the tail end of it. Having eaten so heartily, he feels

dull and sleepy, and throws him.self down by the fire, with his back

towards it, and goes to sleep. AVhile he sleeps he calls to the tlkoi to

come down from the beam on which they are hung. They come down

and are changed into two comely young women with very white soft skins.

They laugh at Raven, and make fun of his scorching back and feet, which

are cracking from the effects of the heat. They presently look about for

something to eat, but can discover nothing but the scanty remains of

Raven's meal, the salmon tail. This they quickly dispose of, Raven

continuing to sleep heavily all the while. Said one to the other, ' I wish

I could find Skauk-'s comb ; I should like to comb my hair.' The other

expressed the same wish, and they both look round for Raven's comb.

Presently they discover a little basket containing what they sought, as

well as other of Skauk-'s belongings, such as needles, paint, &c. This

they appropriate. They comb their hair and paint their faces, laughing

all the time at the slumbering Raven, who is snoring heavily. Said one,

' What is the good of a husband with cracked feet and back ? Let us go

away and leave him.' The other agrees, and they start off, carrying

Raven's little basket and its contents with them. The day is very hot.

They walk along the beach at the edge of the water towards a distant

promontory. As they proceed they shake out some of the paint which

the basket contains, and which, being fine, is scattered all about the beach.

Since that time the beach always shines and glistens in the sunlight.

Just about the time that they were nearing the distant point of land

Raven wakes up. The first thing he did was to look up and see if his

tlkoi were in their place. He finds them gone. He then looks for the

salmon-tail he had left over from his dinner, but cannot find it either.

Then he searches for his paint-basket, but it, too, is missing. Says he to

himself, ' I think the tlkoi must have taken them. I'll go and see if they

are outside.' With that he leaves the house and goes down to the water

and looks up and down the beach. He perceived the two young women

just approaching the distant promontory. ' Ah,' said he, ' they are

leaving me. I must go after them and bring them back.' Thereupon he

set out to overtake the fugitives and bring them back. But as the fire

had burnt and cracked his feet badly while he lay in his heavy stupor, he

finds he cannot walk fast. He is obliged to stop frequently and bathe

them in the cold water. In a short time the young women pass from his

sight beyond the point, and he realises that he has lost them. ' I cannot

myovertake them,' says he ; '  feet are too sore.'    And with that he hobbles

back to his dwelling again, crying and groaning as he went. In the

meantime, when the young women had rounded the pi'oraontory they hear

a peculiar noise. This noise resembled the sounds which a Fort Douglas

(Stlatlumn) woman is said to make with her lips when she wishes to

amuse her child or keep it from crying. They look about them, but at

first can perceive no one. Presently, however, they discover two old

women who are trying to stop the crying of a baby they have in charge,

the mother of whom is away in the woods picking berries. Said one of
the girls to the old women, who are both blind, ' You don't seem able to

stop the child from crying. Here, give it to me.' The old women gave

up the child, thinking the girl was the mother returned from her berry-

wathering. The two girls carry off the child. Some little time after the

mother returns and demands her baby from the old women. Not seeing

her child,  she  cries out,  ' What  have  you  done  with  my  baby ?                                Replied
                                                                                                   '

one of the old women, ' Why, we gave it to you just now.' This state-

ment makes the mother angry, and she takes a big stick and beats the

old women, crying out that she had been robbed of her child. As she

strikes them, one of the pair turns into a sleme (some kind of bird which

I was unable to identify), and flies away making the sound peculiar to its

kind ; the other is transformed into a Cauk- (skull). This the angry

mother throws into the woods, saying as she does so, ' You can't stay

here.' ^ The mother searches all round for some trace of her child. She
walks all night, and early next morning comes upon the girls' tracks.

Presently she finds the dead body of her child on the ground, but the two

tlkoi women who had taken it had entirely disappeared.

                                       Storii of SmEmEfsB'n and Kaiq, the SkunJc and the Mink.

Near by the village of Stapas (Gambier Island, Howe Sound) stands

a large isolated boulder. This rock a very long time ago, the old

Indians believe, was a big tld' anuhautil' q or potlatch- house, owned by

Mink (Putorius (Lutreola) vison) and his sister Skunk (Mephitis mephitica).

It was transformed into a huge boulder after the occurrence of the

events in the following story. One day Kaiq (Mink) called his sister

SraEmEtse'n (Skunk) to him and bade her store up all her tsu'som - in a

number of boxes. SmEmEtse'n did as she was instructed, and filled

several boxes with the pungent fluid. These Kaiq fastened down in an

air-tight manner and stored them in a pile in one corner of the house.

After this he sent out invitations to all the animals and birds and fish of

the district to come to a big potlatch he was going to hold. On the day

appointed the guests ga,tiiered iia Kaiq's tla amikautu' q. The building

was big enough to hold them all easily, but unfortunately for the Whale

the doorway was too narrow for him to get through. Kaiq, prepared for

this dilemma, requested him to put his head and shoulders in and remain

in that position. With some difficulty the Whale complied with Kaiq's

request, and jammed himself in so tight that later, when he wished to

retire, he was unable to do so. Now the Mink was on very bad terms

--with his neighbours the Wolves indeed, he mortally hated the whole Wolf

family, and had actually killed one of them a few days before the feast.

He now takes the tail of the dead Wolf and winds it round his head like a

wreath and opens the proceedings with a dance. The song which Kaiq

sings as he dances is all about the tsu'som of his sister. Skunk. The visitors

presently remark to one another, ' What a dreadful song Kaiq is singing !

Kaiq, however, continues to dance and sing, making his way gradually

i-ound the building towards the corner where the boxes of tsu'som were

stocked. When he is close to the boxes Skunk quickly opens them, as

she had been previously instructed by Kaiq, and lets the tsu'som escape.

No one .suspects the vile purpose the two have in view. They think they

are unpacking their blankets and other presents to give them. But

presently the pungent, suffocating effluvium fills the whole building, and

they realise, too late, what has been done. Unable to get out because of

the huge form of the whale blocking the doorway, after many frantic

struggles they nearly all succumb to the terrible choking stench, four of

them only escaping alive. These ai^e little Louse (MEtcin), who crawled

into a crack in the building and thus avoided the effects of the effluvium

Mallard-ducks since that time always fly skyward when they first rise on

the wing.

     After this trick of Kaiq and his sister, his tld'anibkauta' q with all its
contents was transformed into a big boulder, and the tail of the whale
may be seen, as the old Indians think, to this day stretching out as a

Te Sia'tlinEQ, the llain-Man.

     Sla'tlniEa lived in a big house apart by itself. The inmates consisted of

liimself, his son, and two old women, the name of one of whom was Cauk'

(skull). Not very far away in a neighbouring village lived Skauk", the Raven.

For some time past Skauk- had been trying to find some way to induce

Sia'tlmEQ to make some rain. The season had been extremely hot, and

the sun had dried and scorched up everything. Evei-ybody had suffered

of^reatly from lack of water, all the streams in the neighbourhood ha.ving
been dried up for some time past. But nothing he had done hitherto had

induced Sia'tlmEQ to take any notice of him or open his door. It was the

opening of the door of Sla'tlmEQ's dwelling that caused the rain. If the

door stood ajar it rained softly ;  when it was half open it rained  heavily
                                                                                                              ;

and when it was wide open it came down in torrents. Skauk' sat in the

sweltering heat, parched like the whole land with thirst, revolving in his

mind how to get the rain-maker to open his door, and so save the people

from perishing. Said he to himself, ' I must try and steal his son and

then I can make terms with him, so that we shall not be subject to these

terrible periods of drought.' But Sla'tlmEQ's house was very strongly

built, and for a long time Skauk- does not see how he can manage to

effect an entrance. At length he forms a plan. He calls to him To'tlum,

the Ilea, ME'tcin, the louse, and Qud'tEU, the mouse, and reveals to them

his intention and asks for their aid and co-operation. They promise to
assist him and do what he desires of them. One evening they all set out

together in a big canoe, To'tlum, ME'tcin, and Qoa'tEn bringing with them

all their relations, so that the canoe was full. They presently arrive at

Sla'tlmEQ's house, which contains no opening save the door, which is

fastened very securely from the inside. It was dusk when they arrived,

and Sia'tlmEQ and his household had just gone to bed. ' Now,' said

Skauk- to the others, ' you must manage to get in and keep Sia'tlmEQ

and his household from going to sleep till towards morning. They will
then sleep the heavier, and we shall be able to do what we want without

wakinw any of them. I will wait outside, and when you have wearied

them out and at last permit them to go to sleep Qoa'tEn must open the

door and let me in and I will carry off the boy, and then we can make

our own terms with his father.' Responded they, ' Oh, we'll get in all

ri"-ht. Strong as Sia'tlmEQ has made his house, he cannot keep us out.'

Thus saying, To'tlum sought and found a crack in the boards and,

creeping through this, was soon in, followed by all his people. ME'tcin

and his people did the same, while Qoa'tEn and his friends found a knot-

hole, through which they forced their way. When they were all inside

they proceeded without delay to make things uncomfortable for the

inmates. The fleas got into their blankets and bit their bodies, the lice

into their hair and did the same there, and the mice kept up such a
scratching and gnawing that fro'm the three causes together it was im-

possible for any of them to go to sleep. They tossed and turned, scratched
       m tME ethnological survey of CANAttA.                    5-i5

      their bodies and hfeads, and shook their blankets again and again, but all
     to no purpose ; and not until late in the night, when the mice ceased their
      noise, and the fleas and lice left them, did they get any sleep. Then, worn
     out and heavy with sleep, all sank into deep slumber. QOa'tEn now
     opened the door and let in the waiting Skauk", who quietly takes the rain-
     maker's sleeping son in his arms and carries him down to the canoe. In

      leaving Sla'tlmEQ's dwelling Skauk" sets the door ajar, and the rain at

     once beo-ins to fall lightly. As soon as the child is placed in the canoe

     they leave the place and return to Skauk''s house. When they arrive

      Skauk- takes the still sleeping boy to his house and lays him on his bed.
      About the time that Skauk- and his friends got home Sia'tlmEQ woke up

     and found his door ajar. He soon discovers that his son is missing. He
I is much grieved and goes out and looks about. As he does so he opens

      the door wide and leaves it in that position, thus causing the rain to

     descend in torrents. Suspecting who had robbed him of his child, he

     presently takes his canoe and makes for Skauk-'s landing. When he

      arrives he anchors his canoe, but does not get out of it. The rain does

      not incommode Sia'tlmEQ in the least. Although he has come some

      distance in his canoe, and it has been pouring all the while, not a drop has

      fallen upon him or in his canoe. Wherever he is no rain falls within
      a certain radius of him. The creeks and streams are now full of

     water, and the whole land is drinking in the long-desired rain. When

      Sia'tlmEQ reached the landing he asked the people if they had seen or

      knew anything of his son. ' Yes,' they reply, ' he is here. Skauk- has
      him.' "Tell Skauk- to come to me,' said the rain-maker, who still sat in

      his canoe. Skauk- comes down to the water's edge. Said Sia'tlmEQ to

     him : ' You have my son here, I learn. Why did you steal him away 1 '

       'Yes,' replied Skauk-, ' your son is here, but I did not steal him. I only

      brought him here because we were badly in want of water, and I did not

      know how otherwise to get you to give us rain. I do not wish to rob you
      of your child,' continued he. All the people were dying for want of

     water. You would not open your dwelling to me, and so I got some of
     my friends to help me, and together we found a way to open your door,
     and while you slept I brought away your son. But I am willing to

      restore him to you if you will be friends with us and give us rain whenever

      we want any. I cannot bear to see all the people die and all the berries
      and roots fail us for want of water.' Sia'tlmEQ replied : ' Very well, I will

     be good friends and do as you request, only give me back my son.' Skauk-

      gives the rain-maker back his child, and the two return to their own house.
      Before Sia'tlmEQ left he promised to open his door every now and again

     from that time on. Said he : ' I will keep my door shut for five or ten or

       perhaps twenty days, then I will open it again for a little while and you

      shall have plenty of rain.' As soon as he got home he closed his dwelling

      and the rain ceased at once. About a week after he opened it again for

       some time and the rain again fell. This he did from time to time, and

       has ever since continued to do so ; and thus it is that the rain falls on

      some days and not on others, and we have periods of wet alternating with

       periods of dry weather.

things had gone 6n for a long time when Skauk", the Raven, determitled

to make his brother K'waie'tEk share his precious treasure with the
rest of the world. So one day he made some torches, and lighting some

went down to the beach when the tide was out and sought for sk'Oe'tsai
{Echini). Having found as many as he required, he took them home and,

after eating their contents, placed the empty shells, with their spines still

attached to them, on a platter. These he stealthily takes to his brother

K'waie'tEk's house and spreads them over his doorstep so that he cannot

come out without treading upon them and running the spines into his

feet. Next morning when K-waie'tEk came out of his dwelling he trod

upon the sk'oetsai shells and ran several of the sharp spines into his

naked feet, which made them so sore that he was obliged to keep indoors

and nurse them. Later in the day Skauk' came along ostensibly to pay
his brother a friendly visit, but really to see how far his stratagem for

procuring the Skoail, or Daylight, had been successful. He finds K'waie'tEk

laid up unable to walk, with his feet very painful and much swollen.

' What is the matter, brother K"waie'tEk 1 ' said the Raven. ' Oh,'

responded he, ' I think some of your children must have been playing on

my doorstep last evening and left some sk'oe'tsai thei-e ; for this morning

I trod upon some as I was leaving the house and the shells must have

pierced my feet, and they are so sore and swollen in consequence that I
can't put them to the ground without pain.' ' Let me look at them,' said

Skauk' ; 'perhaps I can find the spines and take them out for you.' So

saying, he took hold of one of his brother's feet and pretended to take out

the sea-urchins' spines, which had embedded themselves in the flesh, with

his knife. He dug the instrument in so roughly, and gave his brother so
Ammuch pain, that the latter cried out in his agony. '
                                                        I hurting you 1

questioned Skauk-. ' It is so dark I can't properly see what I am doing.

Open your Skoail-box a little and I shall be able to see better.' K'waie'tEk

did as his brother suggested, and opened the lid of the box in which he

kept the Daylight a little way. Skauk- continued, however, to hack

away at his foot under pretence of taking the spines out, and presently

K-waie'tEk cried out again. Said the Raven, ' If I hurt you it is your

Whyown fault.  don't you give me more light 1 Here, let me have the

box.' His brother gave him the box, cautioning him the while to be
careful and not open the lid too wide. 'All right,' said Skauk", and he
opened the lid about halfway. Then he made as if to continue his

operation on his brother's feet, but as soon as he turned round he swiftly

threw the lid of the box wide open, and all the Daylight rushed out at

once and spread itself all over the world, and could never be gathered

again. When K-waie'tEk perceived what his brother had done, and that

his precious Skoail was gone from him, he was much distressed, and cried

and wept bitterly and would not be comforted.

Thus it is that the Seagulls to this day never cease to utter their

plaintive cry of k'n-ni  i, k'n-ni  i.

     Once upon a time a number of children were swimming and playing

--about in the shallow water on the beach. The children were of all ages

some quite young, others older. One of the oldest of them, a big boy
named Tetke'tsEn, was sitting on the beach watching the others, and

making some arrows for himself. He was sitting with his back to the

forest, so did not observe that a Ka'k'laitl, or huge witch, was stealing

upon them out of the woods. When she got to him she caught him up

and threw him over her shoulder into her big tso'maicin (basket made

from woven snakes). The lad retained his hold of his knife when she

dropped him into the basket. She next proceeded to where the other

children were huddled together in a territied group and threw them also,

one by one, over her shoulder into the tso'maicin, and cai-ried them off

into the forest. She had not proceeded far, however, when Tetke'tsEn,

making use of his knife, cut a hole in the bottom of the tso'maicin, and

dropped the smaller children one at a time through the opening on to the

ground. They made some little noise as they dropped, thus attracting

the Ka'k'laitl's attention. She called out to Tetke'tsen to know what it
meant. Said she, ' What is that sound (kumin) I constantly hear ?

Tetke'tsEn replies quickly, ' It is only the noise of your heels as you

walk,' and continues dropping the little ones through the hole, bidding

them run home as fast as they could as he did so. By the time the

Ka'k'laitl reached her dwelling in the forest none but the bigger children,

who were too stout to pass through the aperture, remained in the basket.

These she takes into her house ; after which she builds an enormous fire,
putting into it a great number of big stones. These soon got red hot

from the fierce heat. Next she takes some pitch and smears it over the

eyes of the children, so that they cannot raise their eyelids or see what

is going on. While she was busy over the fire Tetke'tsEn had warned his

companions against this trick of the Ka'k'laitl, and had instructed them

to screw up their eyes very tight ( Yd- Ya') when she attempted to pitch
them. Some of them were careful to regard his injunctions, but others

were heedless and closed their eyelids but slightly (mukm'uk). When

Tetke'tsEn's turn came he screwed his eyelids together so closely that

but little of the pitch got on the lashes, and, on trying a moment after if

he could open them, found to his great satisfaction that he could without

much difficulty. He then tells the others to open their eyes. Some of

the others are able to do so a little ; others are not able to separate their

lids or see at all. The Ka'k'laitl now places them in a ring round the

fire at some little distance from it. In the space between it and them

she then commences to dance and sing, arranging at the same time the

heated stones as she circles round the fire. The words of her song are

'ntsaqals ts std'okwitl.^ Tetke'tsEn replies, ' Come opposite me, grand-

mother, but keep your eyes closed or the heat of the fire will bui-n them.'

She continues dancing and singing till she gets between him and the fire.

Then he opens his eyes, and, springing forward, gives her a great shove

and pushes her into the fire, and she falls on the burning stones. ' Open

your eyes,' said Tetke'tsEn to the others, ' and come and help me keep

her down.' They respond to his call, and taking up the spare firewood

heap it upon her, covering her up entirely with it. She screams out,

Tied camps Tetke'tsEn !  TlCd  camps  Tetke'tsEn  !        ' Take me out, Tetke't-
                                                        '

WesEn ! Take me out, Tetke'tsEn ! ' Replied he, '          are trying to, grand-

mother, but you are so heavy.' They continue to pile on more wood,

which, presently blazing up, consumes the Ka'k'laitl. But even when her

body is consumed her bones still cry out ' Tldl camps Tetke'tsEn ! ' for she

cannot die. They watch the fire burn down and then collect the ashes.

These Tetke'tsEn blows upon and scatters abroad, and they are turned

into little birds (tciica'c) known locally as ' snow-birds.' Those who could
not open their eyes for the pitch now cried out to Tukte'tsEn to help them.
At first he could do nothing for them, but on looking round the Ka'k'laitl's

dwelling he discovers some oil and grease. He rubs their eyelids with

some of this, and thus dissolves the pitch, so that they can again open

them and see. After this he takes them all home to their parents, who

had given them up for lost.

                       Te Sk'lcm, the Beaver.

Once upon a time, long ago, Sk'lau had a large family of boys. Not

far off from Sk'lau's dwelling there lived all alone a woman named

Quvie' luioit (Frog). It was winter time and the weather was very cold,

snow covering all the land and thick ice all the water. Sk'lau called his

sons to him and bade them go and gamble (g-a'-g-Eltq) with the Ice.

' Play hard,' said he, 'and don't give up till you have won.' So the boys

gamble with the Ice and play continuously without break for two days

and nights. On the second night Sk'lau goes to the dwelling of QumE'-

lOwit and tells her he wants her for his wife. QumE'lowit gets angry and

reviles him bitterly. She strikes him and sends him away. Sk'lau is

very sad and cries, saying ' c'a'h ! c'a'h ! ' As he goes home he hears his
boys singing over their gambling. ' Haril ila kaitl-kaitl mdiyu I Hani

-- --ua kaitl-kaitl mdiyu I ' Ice crack open ! Ice crack open ! ' repeat they.

Presently the ice began to groan and crack, and by morning the water

is open and the ice gone. When Sk'lau perceives the open water he

plunges in, frisking and leaping like a Salmon. Presently the rain begins

to fall, increasing in violence as Sk'lau leaps and sings. In a short time

the water rises and overwhelms the house of QumE'lowit, who becomes

greatly alarmed for her_ safety, and calls out to the Beaver in her fright.
--' Anutltchi, Sk'lau I

--sent, Beaver ! I consent, Beaver ! Consent, consen - - - nt ' screamed

she.  The only notice  Sk'lau takes of  her now is to call back :              Co'                                co !
                                                                                                               !

I am not such a bad fellow, after all, eh 1 Like to marry me now, would

you ? ' QumE'lowit's house is now full of water, and she struggles with

difficulty on to the roof of it. Sk'lau continues his plunging and leaping,

and when the water is about to wash her off the roof-top she seizes a log

that is floating by and jumps on to it and is carried away. After she

had floated about for some time the log is stranded in a strange country.

Not far off she sees a large house. She goes forward and peeps in.

Within, reclining on his bed, she perceives a man with a very round head

and big face. It was the Moon-man. She enters the building and seats

herself on the side of the fire farthest from the Moon. Said he now to

her, 'Come and sit at the foot of my bed.' ' Do you think I came here,'
responded she, ' to sit at the foot of your bed ? ' ' Come and sit on my

lap, then,' returned he. ' Did I come here for that purpose, do you think ?

mywas her reply. ' Come and sit on  breast, then,' said he again ; ' perhaps

that will please you.' ' I did not come here for that purpose either,'

was her response to this invitation. ' Well, come and sit on my forehead

then ?' To this she consents, and thereupon jnmps up on his face, where

she has remained ever since. '^

                                Te Smai'lEtl, or Wildinen Story.

    Once there was a chief who had an only daughter. He possessed also
a male slave. Now this slave was accustomed to sleep at the foot of the

daughter's bed, his bed lying crosswise at the foot of hers. One night he
crept to her side and ravished her while she slept. Some little while later
she found herself with child, but was wholly ignorant of the person who
had brought this shame upon her, not knowing that the slave had lain
with her in her sleep. AVhen she once realises her condition she is
anxious to find out who had visited her, and suspecting that the intruder
would pay her another visit some night, she takes some paint and smears

it all over the palms of her hands. Shortly after the slave pays her a

second visit. As it is dark she cannot discover who he is, but before he

leaves her this time she presses her paint-smeared hands upon his shoulders
and leaves thereon an impression of them without his knowledge. In the
morning she is greatly surprised to find that it was the slave who had

visited her and whom she had painted on the shoulders. When the chief

became conscious of his daughter's condition he was overwhelmed with
shame. And, on learning who it was who had caused this disgrace to fall
upon him, he took both the guilty slave and his hapless daughter away in
his canoe, and, arriving at a certain lofty clifi" which overhung the water,
he landed them at its base and left them there to perish together. But,
although the cliflf ' was always regarded as inaccessible, in some mysterious
way the pair managed to climb it. After they had reached the top they
travelled inland amongst the mountains till they came to a lake. Here
they stopped and built themselves a house, and here the girl gave birth

to her child. In course of time many other children were born to them,
and when these had come to maturity, as there were no others with whom

they could mate, they took each other to husband and wife, and in time a
large community grew up around the lake. Though living in a wild state,
without proper tools or other utensils, they never forgot their mother's

speech, but always conversed together in Sk-qo'mic. The men were ex-

ceedingly tall and very keen of scent and great hunters. They always
dressed in garments made from the untanned skins of the animals they
had slain. From this habit they were called by the Sk-qo'mic, Smai'lEtl,

or wild people.

                     The Hurons of Lorette. By LltoN G^RIN.

     Two distinct races of aborigines were found by the French explorers

 at the opening of the seventeenth century occupying the basin of the

 St. Lawrence :
      1. The Algonquins, nomadic hunters, roving over the lower valley and

 the northei-n highlands.

      2. The Huron-Iroquois, more sedentary, having some development of

 version as a borrowed form wliich has crept up the river. It is doubtful if the frog
 is much known within the limits of the ' Dry Belt ' in which the N'tlakapamuQ, for
 the most part, reside. It will be remembered that the events in the N'tlakapamuQ
 version took place near Spuzzum, the lower boundary-line of the tribe which is
 immediately contiguous to the upper divisions of the ' Stalo,' or lower Fraser tribes.

      ' The cliff, at whose base the girl and the slave are said to have been left by the

 irate father, is on the right-hand side of the North Arm of Burrard Inlet. Some

agriculture and a better defined organisation, settled in the region of the
three great lakes, Ontario, Erie, Huron ; the Hurons, to the north of
Lake Ontario i the Iroquois, to the south of it ; the Neutrals, to the
north of Lake Erie ; the Eries (or Cats), to the south of the same lake.

     The Hurons (otherwise called Wyandots) alone numbered some
25,000, and their villages were spread from Toronto to the Bay of
Quinte, and from Lake Ontario to Geoi'gian Bay.^ From the north-
westerly projection of that territory to which they had been driven by
degrees, the Hurons, after their overthrow by the Iroquois about 1650,
were dispersed in all directions. Broken fragments of the nation became
the foundation stock of the small Wyandot communities still extant in the
Indian Territory of the United States,^ in Essex (Ontario), and at Lorette,

near Quebec.

     This paper is the result of an inquiry carried on during the summer of
1899 into the social conditions of the Hurons of Lorette. The object was

specially to ascertain the present status of the race, the degree of its

variation from the primitive type, and the influences which brought about
such variation. The method followed was that of social oljservation as
initiated by Frederick Le Play, perfected by Mr. Henri de Tourville, and
propounded by VEcole de la Science Sociale of Paris, and its leader, Mr.

Edmond Demolins.

     The facts descriptive of the present social conditions have for the most
part been collected by the writer in the course of two short visits to
Lorette. As for the historical and general scientific data which supple-
ment and explain the former, they wei'e obtained from original sources,
reference to which is made.

                                                      Fhysical Features.

     Lorette (also called Indian Lorette, or Jeune Lorette, to distinguish it

from I'Ancienne Lorette) lies 46° 51' N. lat. by 71° 21' W. long., on the
north side of the river St. Lawrence, eight or nine miles inland N.W. of

Quebec.

    At this point three natural zones are observable in close succession :

     1. Lorette itself stands on the brow of an elevated terrace which
marks the southerly limit of the Laurentian formation, and from which
the river St. Charles descends through a steep and narrow gorge.-* That
terrace, which extends some eight or ten miles towards the north, has a
flat and almost horizontal surface ; but its soil, though generally deep, is
sandy and rather poor. The land has been partly cleared of woods, but
agriculture has not developed over it to any great extent. Along the
upper course of the river St. Charles, back of Lorette, no farms are to be

fishers, which answers to the lake of i he story. The Skqo'mic firmly believed in
the existence of these Smai'lEtl. The old Indians say they sometimes saw them
when out hunting. Whether such a community once really existed it is impossible
now to say. But, at any rate, no such tribe or people has ever dwelt in the moun-
tains in the memory of the oldest settlers here.

distance back of Lorette. The ' Chateau d'Eau ' is said to stand at an altitude

130 feet greater than the citadel built on the rock which overlooks Quebec.

 seen, but instead, an after-growth of scrubby spruces and the summer
 villas of some professional men of Quebec.

       2. To the south of Lorette, and overlooked by it, there stretches a belt
 of land eight miles wide ; a low plain through which the river St.
 Charles slowly winds its way to its estuary ; a valley scooped out between
 the sandy terrace just described and a narrow ridge which forms the
 north bank of the St. Lawrence. The soil of that second zone is generally

 deep, fertile, and particularly well adapted for agricultural pursuits. As

 evidence of that, fine expanses of cultivated fields interspersed with
 comfortable farmhouses, cosy villages, and glittering church steeples
 are to be seen along the lower course of the St. Charles, over its rich bottom

 lands or loamy hillsides.
      3. Towards the north the sandy terrace of Lorette merges into a vast

 mountainous tract which extends to Hudson Bay and the Atlantic
 Ocean, interrupted only by the valley of Saguenay and Lake St. John.
 These North Laurentian highlands present a succession of rocky, rounded
 summits cut by narrow valleys, with sparse, limited areas of shallow soil.

A land well adapted for the production of timber, especially for the

growth of the Coniferpe, and originally a tract abounding in fur-

 bearing animals, but over the greater part of its extent offering little

inducement to agricultural settlers, who of late years only have taken a

foothold within its borders.

      In other words, Lorette lies at the meeting point of two great regions
widely different in their productions and capabilities : the Champaign
region bordering on the St. Lawrence, and the North Laurentian high-
lands ; the former restricted and narrowing, the latter, on the contrary,
expanding at this point of the valley. Lorette is still within the Champaign
region, not, however, on its inner fertile zone, but on its outer sandy
zone ; and adjoining it, or in close proximity to it, there are, on the one
hand, a fine agricultural country, on the other a rugged wilderness.^

     The geographical position of the Hurons of Lorette is very similar to
that which was occupied by their ancestors, in the vicinity of Lake
Simcoe, during the first half of the seventeenth century. Though some
400 miles to the west of Lorette, and 150 miles nearer to the equator,
the old Huron country was situated alike on the border of that
great Laurentian formation, betwixt mountain and plain, with to one

side a vast natural hunting ground, and to the other deep soils invit-

ing tillage.

     However, as regards soil and climate, the habitat of the ancient
Hurons was more favoured than the sandy terrace of Lorette. Cham-

plain and the early explorers who ascended the river Ottawa and its
tributary, the Mattawa, and by way of lake Nipissing, French River and
the shores of Georgian Bay, reached the Wyandot settlements adjoining
Lake Simcoe, were much impressed by the pleasantness and fertility of

that country compared with the rocky solitude they had just traversed.
They write in glowing terms of Huronia, its extensive clearings, its fields
of maize, sunflowers, and pumpkins, its fruit trees, in the midst of gentle

hills and verdant plains watered by many a stream. The soil, though

     ' In the mapping of the natural zones surrounding Lorette the publications of

the Geological Survey of Canada have been very helpful. The map showing the
superficial deposits between Lake Superior and Gaspe (Atlas, 1863) and the map of

geological formations in the province of Quebec attached to Dr. Ella's report for

1887, are here specially referred to.

somewhat sandy in places, they say, is on the whole well, suited to the
growth of Indian corn.^

     To-day the counties of East and North Simcoe, which comprise the
greater portion of the later settlements of the Hurons, support a farming
and trading population of over 65,000 whites. They are thriving sections
of a highly prosperous province.^ In contrast the sandy terrace back of
Lorette, even up to this time, is sparsely settled, and, like the Laurentian
highlands to the north, remains almost untouched by agricultural

enterprise.

                           Labour.

     Sixty-two families, or about 300 men, women, and children, make

up the resident population of Indian Lorette.^ The forms of labour

through which these people support themselves are as follows, in the

order of decreasing importance : (1) Hide-dressing ; (2) moccasin-making ;

(3)  snovvshoe- and  canoe-making                                                        (4)  basket-making  and  fancy  wares
                                                                                      ;                                                           ;

--(5) hiring out as guides ; (6) hunting and fishing ; (7) farming.
    Hide-dressing. From 10,000 to 15,000 hides are dressed yearly at

Lorette. These hides are for the most part imported. East India elk
and antelope making the bulk ; caribou {Tarandxis ranrjifer) and cow, the
produce of the region, are used in certain quantities, as also a few moose

pelts.

     The dressing processes are very simple. The green skins are first

steeped in water, mere barrels sunk in the ground in an open field

serving the purpose. Once thoroughly soaked the skins are scraped ; the
inner (meat) layer and the first outer (hair) layer of the hide are thereby

removed. (The scrapings are sold to manufacturers of glue.) Then

other labourers take the skins and wash them in soap emulsions, and

afterwards sprinkle them with oil. Codfish oil is used for this. The

skins are then rubbed with sand-paper, and finally passed through a

smoke-house, similar to that used in the curing of hams. At viirious

stages of preparation the skins are put up to dry on scaffolds made of

poles connected by rails to which hooks are attached. These scafTolds, or

' chantiers de peaux,' are a characteristic feature of Lorette. Not only

do they cover two or three large fields adjoining the village, but, as well,

smaller patches within the village plot. With the smoke-house and the

hide-wringer they constitute practically the whole plant required for the

dressing of hides.

     The hide-dressing industry at Lorette is centred in three or four fairly

large establishments managed by private enterprise, and in connection

with which the manufacturing of moccasins and snowshoes is carried on.
The head of each concern owns or rents the grounds and buildings, owns

the plant, purchases the green hides and accessories from importers in

Quebec, and pays his help wages by the day or month. The hides thus

dressed are not sold, but utilised on the same premises, principally in the

manufacture of moccasins.

   --Moccasin-'making. The output at Lorette in 1898 was about 1-10,000

pairs.i The first operation is the cutting of the hide. It is done, in work-
shops connected with the dressing-grounds, by the boss himself or by
specially skilled workmen under his supervision. These workmen are
paid by the day or piece. The work is performed by means of a sharp
knife and various wooden forms. It requires some skill to make the most
of a hide, to cut out of each skin the greatest possible number of bottoms,
tops, and uppers with the smallest possible proportion of useless cuttings.
This is the main operation in the hide-dressing and moccasin-making
business, that which is left to the boss, or head of the industry, whenever
he takes a hand in the work. The three processes which follow, viz. (1)
embroidering of the top piece, (2) turning up of the bottom piece and
sewing-on of the top, and (3) sewing-on of the upper piece, are not accom-
plished by men at the workshop, but in the village homes by women
making a speciality of one of the above operations. They are paid by the

piece.

     Moose-hair, dyed in bright colours, serves for embroidering the top

piece. Twenty-five to thirty cents per dozen pairs are the wages paid
for that work, and a woman, besides attending to her daily house-work,

may find time to embroider from one to two dozen pairs a day. The

second and third processes above mentioned are each paid for at about

the same rate as the first, and an equal amount of work may be accom-
plished by hand at each one of them by one person in a day. By means
of a sewing-machine three dozen pairs of moccasins may be sewed in a
day's work. To increase their earnings in that way, some of the Lorette

women have provided themselves with sewing-machines. When shoe-

maker's thread is used instead of the ordinary, the wages paid run as high
as one dollar a dozen pairs. The moccasins are then returned to the
central workshop, where, by means of three simple apparatus, holes are
punched through the uppers, eyelets fastened on to one side, and hooks to

the other. Laces are made of strips from the edgings of the hide.
Finally the moccasins are packed and shipped to distant points. They
are sold wholesale to large dealers in towns and cities throughout Canada
and the United States ; in late years large quantities have been for-
warded to the Klondike.

  --Snoioshoe-viaking. Seven thousand pairs of snowshoes were turned out

at Lorette in 1898 ; but the demand was larger than usual that year
consequent on the opening up of the Klondike. That same year as many
as 20,000 hides were dressed in the locality and 12,000 dozen pairs of
moccasins manufactured. The following year there was a marked falling
off in the demand, especially of snowshoes, the Lorette snowshoe not
having been found of as suitable a shape as other makes for use in the
Klondike. Cow-skin is largely used for the netting of the snowshoe, and
ash wood for the frame.

      It should be noted that in the various industries carried on at Lorette
there are not only Hurons engaged, but a number, quite as large, of
French Canadians residing at St. Ambroise, across the river. This is

particularly the case with the moccasin-making industry, in which many
French Canadian women take a hand. Snowshoe-making is an exception
to the rule ; it is still a distinctive Huron industry, only two French

Canadians beinog trained in the art.

      About twenty-five canoes are made and sold every year. Fine birch

 bark suitable for canoe-making is not very easily found within reasonable

 distance, and most of the canoes turned out at Lorette are made of

 canvas purchased from Quebec dealers.
      Some years ago lacrosses were manufactured in certain quantities

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

 but very few are made now. Toboggan-making is also an industry of

 the past here. Competition has killed it, toboggans manufactured at

--Montreal and elsewhere being considered of better quality.
      Basket-making and Fancy Wares. With ash wood and sweet hay the
 Huron women manufacture baskets of ornamental designs and various
small wares : fans, boxes, i-eticules, toys, itc. The men occasionally lend
 a hand in preparing strips of ash and discs of various woods, but the
women and girls practically have the industry to themselves. Contrary
 to the preceding, this industry is not a traditional one of Lorette : it was
 introduced here from the Abenakis Reservation of St. Francis (on the
south shore of the St. Lawrence) some fifteen years ago. It has hot
developed to the same extent as hide-dressing and moccasin-making, and
is still essentially a home industry. Several families have large displays

 of these Indian wares in their houses. Part of the output is disposed of,
as in the case of moccasins and snowshoes, to dealers in large cities ; the

bulk is sold by the Hurons themselves to visitors in their village, or taken
by them to summer resorts and centres of population, and there retailed.

      Of late a severe blow was dealt to this businesss through the with-
drawal by the United States Government of the privilege exempting Indians

--from paying duty on their wares when entering that country.
      Guiding. Several of the Lorette Hurons hire out periodically to
parties of sport seekers on hunting or fishing excursions into the interior.
This is a favourite occupation of many of the men. While thus engaged
they earn one dollar and twenty-five cents per day, besides tlieir living

expenses.

   --Hunting and Fishing. Like the preceding a favourite occupation of

the Hurons, though (except for a very few) it is not any longer an
important means of livelihood. In 1898, the revenue derived from
hunting by the Lorette community was estimated at 800 dollars, and that
from fishing at 100 dollars.^

     Beaver, otter, marten, mink, and caribou are still found in faii'ly large
numbers over the vast unsettled tract which extends towards the north.
The upper courses of the rivers St. Charles, Jacques-Cartier, Ste. Anne,

&c., which lead into that wilderness, are much interrupted by rapids, and
canoes cannot be much used as means of conveyance. The hunters

proceed on foot, sometimes right across the streams. Otter and beaver
are the most valuable of the fur-bearing animals. The furs are generally
sold undressed to large dealers in Quebec. Caribou are found in
abundance, and they provide good meat, but their skin is of little value.

The skin of the moose is worth three or four times as much ; but moose
is scarce now in this part of the countiy. To find it hunters have to

cross the St. Lawrence and reach the plateaus of Northern New Brunswick

and of Maine. They do so by railway.
     The Hurons of Lorette bitterly complain of interference with their

hunting privileges on the part of the whites through governmental
regulations, leases to clubs, and the creating of a national park north of

Quebec. Forest rangers are on the look out, and frequently confiscate the

pelts and destroy the traps of the Indian hunters.

  --Farming. The Huron villagers do not seek any appreciable part of

their income from agriculture, nor even from those more simple opportuni-

ties afforded by country life. Only three or four families keep a cow

each, and some hens ; only a few have a small kitchen garden ; the others
purchase from French Canadian farmers the very milk, eggs, and vege-

tables they consume. Only one of the villagers keeps horses.

Two miles to the west of Lorette village there is a reserve 1,600

arpents (1,350 acres) in area, on which six or seven Huron families are

supposed to be farming. Although they may occasionally turn out a few

pairs of snowshoes, they do not resort to industries in at all the same

measure as do the Lorette villagers. At the same time they can hardly

be considered farmers. Much the greater part of the reserve is still bush.

Each farm comprises a few arpents (at most ten or twelve) of cleared

land, on which the only growth to be observed, apart from a small

garden and potato patch, is a miserable field of very thin hay overrun by

the ox-eye daisy. In rare instances a crop of a few bushels of oats may

be added. When any farm animals are kept, the stock comprises one

cow (exceptionally two), one horse (if any), one or two porkers, and about

as many hens. Attracted to one of these homesteads by the rather better

appearance of the house and the barn compared with the hovels on most

of the other clearings, we were disappointed to find that the husbandry
Wethere carried on was of the same general undeveloped type.

see any stock, but were met by the fierce barking of three or four dogs

coming out in succession from under the doorsteps. ' They are very good

hunting dogs,' the people told us by way of apology.

For the Hurons of the reserve a more congenial means of living than

Weagriculture is hunting.   had an hour's chat with Thomas Tsioui, a

typical old Huron. Three of his sons still living are hunters as much as

conditions permit ; he himself spent the greater part of his early life in

the woods. At one time he was a noted long-distance runner at the

Quebec and Montreal fairs.

In 1898, the revenue derived from farming by the whole Huron com-

munity was estimated at 870 dollars.^ The revenue obtained from their

farms and from the chase are insufticient for the support of these Hurons

of the reserve, and they would be in utter misery were it not for some

additional revenue from various sources : drawing firewood from the
reserve to the Lorette villagers, day labour performed on the railway and

elsewhere in the vicinity, and oftentimes the very material help provided

by their women folk.

    With all that, a large proportion of the Lorette Indians have been
forced to seek elsewhere their means of livelihood. The Huron com-

munity reckons 142 absentees against a resident population of 300. That

is to say about one-third of the total number has left for other parts of

Canada or for the United States. Now and then some of these effect

their return to their old abode, while others start out in their turn.

The means of living of our modern Hurons as just described do not at

amounted to 27,.500 dollars, and wages earned to 9,000 dollars, giving for the Hurons

(1899) the returns were as follows : Manufacturing industries, 18,000 dollars ; wages,

first sight appear to have any connection either with the previous social

status of the race, or with the physical features of its present habitat.
In a general way, with the ancient Hurons, agriculture and hunting were
the principal means of living ; to-day at Lorette, labour in both these
forms has been almost entirely given up. In their stead manufacturing

--industries have grown industries, besides, which do not depend for their

raw material on the resources of the locality, and which find in the

vicinity a market for only a very small portion of their output.

However, from a perusal of the documentary evidence available, old

and new, and from what could be gathered in conversation with men and

women at Lorette, I obtained some insight into the process of evolution

from which the labour system of the Hurons has resulted.

Their ancestors in Western Ontario supported themselves chiefly by

hunting, fishing, and agriculture. The young men were hunters and

warriors                                          the  older  male members  of  the tribe, fishermen ;  the women,
                                               ;

tillers of the soil, growers of maize, beans, pumpkins, sunflowers, and

tobacco. Besides, the Hurons were trained in the practice of a number

of home industries. The men built huts made of saplings, and which in

the words of Parkman ' were much like an arbor overarching a garden

walk.' 1 The men, as well, made their own bows and arrows, fishing

nets, stone axes, bark canoes, toboggans, snowshoes, and lacrosses. The

Hui-on women ground the corn, smoked the fish, spun the wild hemp for

the fishing-nets, dressed deer skins, and from them made moccasins, which

they embroidered handsomely, and out of the furs of the beaver, the

porcupine, &c., prepared various articles of clothing.^ In some of these

industries tlie Hurons were not found as expert as their neighbours of

Algonquin stock, but they surpassed these in commercial aptitudes, having

from time immemorial acted as middlemen between the tribes to the

north and those to the south in the exchange of various commodities, and,

after the advent of the French, becoming the purveyors and carriers of

their fur trade.^

     After taking up their abode in the vicinity of Quebec, the Hurons
were subjected to new conditions, the result of the close neighbourhood
and competition of the French colonists, combined with the physical

features of the country. These conditions in the first place tended to

keep them away from agriculture.
     The traditional mode of farming of the Hurons was very imperfect.

It consisted in the production through female labour of supplies of

vegetables and maize for family needs. No live stock, no beasts of

burden, were kept. Thus, being without the means of manuring the land
or drawing fuel long distances, they had to change their location as soon

as the fertility of the soil and the supply of firewood within a limited

area were exhausted. Such had been the practice in the old Huron
country ; such it continued to be with the Huron refugees about Quebec.

But here, while the Indians were always free to desert their village site
for a new one farther inland, they were no longer at liberty to retrace
their steps. The influx of white settlers at their back prevented them
from moving in any but one direction. In that way the Hurons, who
after their arrival amongst the French colonists had been located on the

lowlands bordering the river St. Lawrence, receded gradually from the

                                                  1 Jesviis in JVm'th America, Little Brown, Boston, Int. XXVI,

ffontj until in 1697 they found themselves evicted from tlie fertile belt,

relegated to the sandy terrace close on the mountain tract. Under such
conditions they could not be expected to make any great advance in

agriculture.^

     While both the social and the physical environment about Quebec
tended to check the agricultural progress of the Hurons, these same con-
ditions at first favoured their propensity for the chase and for warlike

occupations. At their doors that great Laurentian mountain tract

extended, abounding in fish, game, fur-bearing animals ; and for all these
natural productions Quebec offered a near-by and ready market. Besides,
their close association with the white settlers enabled them to obtain

assistance and employment in various forms. As long as the French

regime lasted, and for half a century more under the British rule, the
Hurons appear to have supported themselves chiefly through the sales of
furs and allowances for military service. References to them in the
documents of that period (the writings of the missionaries excepted) are
mostly all in connection with the fur trade or with war parties.^ In
1730, a church was built for their use, and their contributions were paid

Ain furs, apparently their most valuable and abundant commodity.^

conspicuous feature of Lorette to the present day is a large, low, massive
stone structure, which is said to have been originally a post of one of the
fur-trading companies, and which subsequently became the property
of a noted Huron chief, Picard, himself a trader in furs.

     During the whole of the eighteenth century the traditional industries
of the Hurons do not appear to have been developed beyond the measure
of the family needs. It is not until the early part of the nineteenth
century that we notice a change in this respect. The facts adduced
before a committee of the legislative assembly of Lower Canada in 1819
and 1824 show that for some years previous the Hurons of Lorette had
been sustaining themselves to some extent through the manufacture and
sale of moccasins, snowshoes, toboggans, fur articles of dress, and various
fancy wares.'' This new feature had been brought about as a result of
the constant decline of their agriculture, and more especially, at a
subsequent date, by the decline of the chase itself, as also by the
reduction of the war allowances. It should be noted, moreover, that as
the Hurons, under the influence of environment, were slowly improving
their mode of living, larger and more regular returns than those ensured

by hunting were necessary to keep them in comfort. By manufacturing

they enhanced the value of the furs, and thus made up in part for their
greater scarcity and for the deficiency in the returns from other sources.
For many years these industries were carried on by the Huron families
in a very small way, at first exclusively by the women, and then by both
men and women, but on a small scale. Both hunting and plot farming

were prosecuted in conjunction, but the latter especially remained at a
very low stage, or even decreased, v/hile the manufacturing industries all
the time wez'e growing.-^

Soaie twetity-five or thirty years ago there took place an important

--social phenomenon which completed the transformation of the labour

system of the Hurons the sjireading throughout Canada of the world-

wide commercial and industrial evolution, the introduction of machinery,

the building of railways, the extension of great transportation agencies.

Man's power of production was thereby increased a hundredfold, and

distance suppressed, so to speak. While some of the minor industries of

Lorette, such as toboggan- making and lacrosse-making, received their
death-blow from the new order of things, it instilled a new life into some

--others hide-dressing, moccasin and snowshoe making. No longer

dependent on local conditions, no longer restricted by the short supply of

raw material at hand or by the limited demand from near-by markets,

these industries attained the high degree of development which we have

Aseen.  new industry, fancy basket-making, was introduced. The

development of manufacturing industries thus brought about, with the

opportunities for constant earning of wages at generally pleasant tasks,

in turn became a further cause of desertion of agriculture. Even hunting
is no longer considered a regular means of livelihood, and is largely

replaced by the more profitable occupation of guiding through the woods

sportsmen from the cities.

   A Huron woman, ninety years of age, with whom I conversed at

Lorette, had witnessed many phases of that evolution of labour. She

remembered the time when patches of Indian corn, pumpkins, beans, and

potatoes were grown in connection with almost every home in the village.
The women did most of the garden and field work, while the men did

very little but hunt and play lacrosse. She saw agriculture given up

gradually, while the Hurons were taking more and more to manufacturing.

Notwithstanding the evolution through which their labour system has

been made to pass, the Huron community as a whole exhibit traits
retained from the previous social status. The men are less industrious

than the women : they still entertain a dislike for agriculture and steady

work ; they abstain from working in factories.

                       Property,

The property held in trust for the Hurons of Lorette comprises :

(1) the village site, about 20 arpents in extent ; (2) adjoining the latter,

a common covering,  9  arpents                                      (3)  two  miles from the village, the
                                                                 ;

reserve proper, 1,600 arpents (1,350 acres) in extent ; and (4) some thirty

miles back of Lorette, the Rocmont Reserve, in the county of Portneuf,

9,600 acres in area.

     1. The village plot is subdivided into small lots, each family being
entitled to an area sufficient for a house, besides a width of 30 feet in

front and 3 feet at the back of that house.

     2. The common was originally, as indicated by its French name, ' Clos
des Cochons,' a pasture for hogs. It still continues to be owned in common
by the Huron community, but is now used almost solely as a hide-dressing
ground by Mr. Maurice Bastien, who has erected thereon sheds and drying

scaffolds.

     3. The 1,600 arpents reserve also remains undivided. It was granted
to the Hurons for their supply of fuel. The greater part is still bush.
Six or seven families, as we have seen, have taken up their abode there as
farmers ; but the farming carried on is of such a primitive character
ON TSe ethnological SURVEY OF CANADA.  559

that it has not been found necessary to trace any boundaries between the

various farms.

     The above three areas were allotted to the Hurons about the end of
the seventeenth century, or the beginning of the eighteenth, by the Jesuits,
under whose charge they were placed. The deed confirming the grant
was not passed till 1742 (for the last) and 1794 (for the two others). It
is all that is left to the Hurons of the seigniory of Sillery.^

     4. The Rocmont Reserve is wholly a mountainous forest tract set apart
by the Canadian Government in recent times for the support of the
Hurons of Lorette, but neither occupied nor worked by them. However,
they derive some revenue from it, the cut of pine and spruce over its
area being leased out every year to lumbermen, and the proceeds usually
paid to the ' band ' in the form of allowances.

     It is a remarkable fact that all this property is still held in common.
With the Hurons of Lorette private ownership of land does not exist.
Neither have they any desire, as far as I could ascertain, to individually

--own land. To my knowledge only one Huron to-day holds privately

some land not in the reserve, but adjoining it. In the past, as well,
such cases of private ownership have been exceedingly rare.

    On the other hand, at Lorette almost eveiy family owns the house in
which it lives, at any rate so long as it continues to occupy it. Mov-

ables, wearing apparel, &c., are, of course, also recognised private property,
as are wages and earnings from various sources.

     This system of property of the Hurons of Lorette does not differ
materially from that of their forefathers. The ancient Hurons, as we
have seen, did not put much labour on the soil, and correspondingly their
hold on the soil was of a weak and limited sort. From Champlain and
Brebeuf we learn that they had no permanent tenure of land, as evidenced

by their change of abode at frequent intervals. At the same time, with

--them all movables as, for instance, the produce of the chase, the
--earnings from trade were subject to family or individual appropriation.

Inequalities of wealth from this source were quite apparent in the Huron
villages of old. Even monopolies were recognised by the ancient Hurons,
inasmuch as individuals who had opened a trade or discovered a market

were granted for themselves and their kindred the exclusive right of
carrying on that trade or supplying that market, or were permitted to

levy tribute on those desirous of taking advantage of the new opening.

A difference, however, from the conditions of things in existence to-day

at Lorette was the prevalence of theft in the Huron villages of old and

its lax repression.^

     After their removal to the vicinity of Quebec, the Hurons, as we have

seen, did not take more energetically to the cultivation of the soil ; on the
contrary, under the new conditions they gave up little by little the practice
of agriculture. Similarly they did not develop any greater aptness to hold

 land either privately or collectively.

      In 1651, the King of France bestowed on the Christian Indians settled

in the vicinity of Quebec (of whom the Hurons were the nucleus) a grant

of land covering three miles in width on the river St, Lawrence by twelve
miles in depth, the seigniory of Sillery. Of course, the Hurons were

      ' The originals of the deeds are in the archives of the Department of Indian
 Affairs, Ottawa. I have to thank Mr. Samuel Stewart and Mr. D. C. Scott for their

kindness in facilitating my inquiry.

quite unprepared to tftke advantage or retain posseSsioii of such ail extent
of territory, especially in a region where arable land was rather scarce
and greatly in demand. They allowed themselves to be dispossessed
piecemeal of the land itself, and of the seigniorial dues attached to it as
well, and were left with holdings totally inadequate for their support and
advancement.

     In short, the system of property of tlie Hurons of Lorette is character-
ised by the absence of private holdings and the limitation of the collective
holdings. These conditions are the direct outcome of the forms of labour
which they retained or adopted under the combined influence of their own
traditions, of the physical features of the country around Quebec, and of
social environment and competition.

      These property conditions, in their turn, have had far-reaching effects

on the further social evolution of the Huron community. They permitted
its being closely surrounded and permeated in its home life by outside
(principally French Canadian) notions and manners. The village of
Lorette is inextensive, and so penetrated by the adjoining settlements,
that on its outskirts, at many points, Huron homes almost join those of
white neighbours, and it is often a difficult matter to say where the line
of demarcation passes. The consequences of this close neighbourhood will

appear presently.

                                                             Family.

     The family group at Lorette is quite restricted. Each household, as a
rule, consists of a single family, comprising only a few persons ; for
instance, the husband, the wife, and two or three young children ; in other
cases an aged couple alone, or possibly assisted by a grown-up daughter or

son. When barely eight or ten years old the Huron boy or girl takes to

manufacturing fancy wai-es at home, and soon acquires a ti'aining in the

various arts. At twenty or twenty-two they marry, and take up house

separately from the parents. If they have decided to remain at Lorette,
and are not already provided with a lodging there, they apply for a lot
from the village council, and build a house for themselves. In recent
years the development of industry has induced several newly married

couples to take up their home in their native village ; a new street, or
rather lane, had to be opened, and still another will be opened soon.

     The restricted family group of the Hurons of Lorette is very unlike
the patriarchal household of their ancestors, wherein eight or ten, or even
as many as twenty-four, families lived under one roof.^ Apart from that
close material grouping into large households, there existed, among the

--ancient Hurons, social groups much more comprehensive clans founded

on consanguinity. At one time there were as many as twelve clans,
among which the Huron families were distributed.

     ' The unit of the Wyandot social and political systems,' writes Mr.

W. E. Connelly, whose knowledge of the Wyandots settled in the Indian

Territory of the United States is most thorough, ' was not the family nor
the individual, but the clan. The child belonged to its clan first, to its

parents afterwards.' ^

     The clans were not mere local organisations ; they were ramified
throughout the whole territory, throughout the whole nation ; so that
"while the people, for purposes of livelihood, were dispersed in distant

                                 ' Champlain, vol. iv. p. 74.

villages, and for purposes of government were divided into five or six

tribes or sub-nations, still they held fast together by the strong bond of

the clan founded on family relationship.

   A peculiar feature of the Huron-Iroquois clanship was that it existed

and was transmitted, not through the men, but through the women of the
tribe or family. The Huron child did not belong to the clan of his
father, but to that of his mother. In the same way the possessions of a
deceased Huron warrior did not go to his sons, but to his brothers, or to
the sons of his sisters ; that is, to members of his own clan.

    At Lorette to-day no trace is to be found of the old Huron clanship
in the social institutions ; even the memory of it is almost effaced. The
members of the band whom I questioned on the subject were not totally

ignorant of the clan system, but they invariably connected it with male
descent. One Huron, ninety years of age, and another seventy-six years

of age, told me they belonged to the clan or ' compagnie ' of the Deer,

their reason for saying so being that their father had belonged to it.

Another claimed to be of the ' compagnie ' of the Tortoise, also because

his father had been of that clan ; and to remove my doubts he added :

' How could I belong to a Huron clan through my mother, who was a

French Canadian ?

     Old Thomas Tsioui (whose name has been mentioned previously)

expressed somewhat similar views to me. His contention is that the
Tsiuuis are the only genuine Hurons at Lorette ; that all the others are
descendants of French Canadians who stole their way into the Huron

community. As I objected that the Tsiouis themselves could not claim
pure Huron extraction, their mothers and grandmothers in most cases
being French Canadian women, the old man argued with great warmth
that man, and not woman, the husband, not the wife, made the race.

He was seemingly unaware that this was the very opposite of the Huron
doctrine, and that his use of such an argument was good proof to me that

he was no longer a Huron in respect to some of the fundamental traditions

of the race.

   A simple phenomenon which marks the evolution of our Hurons from

the patriarchal community and clanship of their ancestors to the reduced

family group of to-day is the adoption of distinct family names, trans-

mitted from father to son. With the old Hurons there did not really
exist any permanent family names other than the general designation of
each clan. Each individual was given a name distinctive of himself and
of his clan as well, but which, as in the case of the first name with us, he
did not transmit to his progeny. ' Each clan,' writes Mr. Connelly, ' had
its list of proper names, and this list was its exclusive property, which no
other clan could appropriate or use. . . . The customs and usages govern-

ing the formation of clan proper names demanded that they should be
derived from some part, habit, action, or some peculiarity of the animal
from which the clan was descended. . . . Thus a proper name was always a

distinctive badge of the clan bestowing it. When death left unused any

of the original clan proper names, the next child born into the clan, if of

the sex to which the temporarily obsolete name belonged, had this name

bestowed upon it.' ^

     After the missionaries had converted the Hurons to the faith they
introduced Christian names, which for many generations were used

       ' Connelly, Ontario Archxologioal Re2)ort, 1809, p. 107.

1900.
562 REPOM-- 19U0.

concurrently with clan designations, but in the end superseded them.
Most of the family names at Lorette are Christian names which have
become permanently attached to the various households : Romain, Vincent,

Gros-Louis, Bastien (for Sebastien). It was in the early years of the

present nineteenth century that family names became permanent at
Lorette, and transmissible from father to son. There are to-day 21

families of Tsiouis, 13 Picard, 12 Gros Louis, G Vincent, 4 Bastien, 2
Romain, besides 3 de Gonzague (of Abenakis extraction), and 1 Paul (of

Malecite extraction).

     From the organisation of the family group, if we turn to its internal
management, we find, in the first place, that the parents' authority over the
children is of limited extent. Very little restraint is put on the children.

Constant intercourse between the various households in that crowded
village tends to lessen the action of each separate group over its children.

These, at an early age, as we have seen, acquire a training in handicraft
and become important factors in the welfare of the family, or at any rate
independent of it for their livelihood. In that respect the Hurons of
Lorette still resemble to a certain extent their primitive ancestors, who
allowed their children great freedom, and never chastised them.^ Among
the ancient Hurons the laxity of parental rule was the natural result of

the development of hunting and of warlike pursuits, in all of which the

young men had necessarily a superiority over the older members of the
family. With the Hurons of Lorette the same lax family government

continued to prevail, owing to the long maintenance of the chase as their
principal means of living, only to be displaced in recent times by industries
which afford to the young great facilities for the establishment of separate
independent homes.

     Nevertheless morals are not bad. They are certainly greatly in
advance on what they were in olden times. But the result is due almost

--wholly to outside influences religious action and social environment. The

morals of the ancient Hurons were of a very low order : debauchery was
rampant in their villages.- When, after their overthrow by the Iroquois,
they fell under the rule of the Jesuit missionaries, a strict code of monastic
morality was enforced upon them.^ The greater number submitted to it,
not, however, through any strong personal sense of duty and self-respect, but
impelled by fear of exclusion from the reserve or of the infliction of some
public penance. Accordingly, under the British regime, as soon as the
.strong hand of the Jesuit was withdrawn, the Huron morals relaxed, and,
under the influence of the corrupt elements from the near-by city, fell to
a very low plane. In the course of the nineteenth century Lorette
became ' the constant resort of the dissipated youth of Quebec, and the
scene of midnight orgies and profligacy of the worst description, until the
extent of the evil attracted the attention of the police authorities, who
took measures to repress the mischief.' ' Since, under the combined
influence of religious preaching and of better social environment, they
have gradually impvoved in self-restraint and self-respect. Illegitimate
births are now of rare occurrence. Many, howevei-, are still addicted to

liquor.

Very little, indeed, remains of the old Huron traditions. The tenets

of the Catholic faith have stamped out the pagan myths and superstitions

of primitive times. While these Hurons have not attained a very

high degree of religious development, they have drifted far away from

--the beliefs of their ancestors. The only trace and a doubtful one

at that--I could find of their past faith was the vain boasting of one of

their old men, who wished to impress me with his medical skill : he had

the power, he told me, of stopping or quickening at will the How of the

blood through the sick man's body. Was this a faint recollection of the
old-time medicine man and sorcerer ?

The Huron tongue is no longer spoken at Lorette. French has

replaced it. Even the older members of the tribe, in answer to my

inquiries, had the greatest difficulty in recalling a few disconnected

words. Some of them could barely tell the meaning of their own Huron

name which on exceptional occasions they affix to their every-day French

name. Even the few Huron words thus preserved in their family

nomenclature do not appear to be rightly pronounced by them ; in many

names the letter ' L' has been introduced, and this their ancestors did not

make use of. For instance, hahn-yohn-yeh, the old Wyandot word for

bear,^ has been  changed  at  Lorette  to  hahn-yohn-len                                                  Ovvawandaronhe,
                                                                                                       ;

Odiaradheite, and Tedcheandahe '^ have become respectively Wawendarolen,

Ondiaralete, and Teachendale. As far back as fifty years ago, the Huron

tongue was already out of general use at Lorette."* From Franquet we

learn that about the middle of the eighteenth century a number of the

Hurons could speak French.^

The Huron boys and girls show marked aptitudes for commerce,

industrial arts, and even the line arts ; but they seldom develop these

talents to any degree, though opportunities are sometimes odered them of

doing so. They nearly all have line voices and a good ear for music
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

some of them have shown taste as draughtsmen or painters. The greater

number, however, lack the steadiness of purpose which would be neces-

sary to make the most of their talents.

                                                Mode of Living,

    As regards food, shelter, clothing, hygiene, recreations, the people of
Lorette may be considered to-day as having the same habits as the Fi-ench

Canadians of corresponding classes.
     The greater quantity of the food consumed by them is obtained from

itinerant traders or from dealers who supply the French Canadians of 8t.
Arabroise as well. I happened to take a meal at the home of one of the
poorest Huron families settled on the reserve, and still remember how I
enjoyed that simple lunch of milk, butter and bread, cream and preserved
fruit, which was daintily served in clean china or glass and on neat linen.
From the accounts left by Kalm (1749) and Franquet (1752) we may
safely draw the conclusion that, about the middle of the eighteenth

century, after one hundred years' intercourse with the French, the Hurons,

as regards the food consumed and its preparation, retained much of the

tastes and coarseness of their piimitive ancestors.'
     The houses at Lorette are generally small, losv-roofed, wooden build-

ings whitewashed. They are disposed in double fows, aloiig harrow lanesi,

and most of them devoid of yard, garden, or outbuildings. Sometimes

these houses are too close to one another for the comfort of their

occupants. On the other hand there is an air of cleanliness about them,

and with few exceptions, they appear to be as well kept as the tidiest

French Canadian farmer's or mechanic's home. The Hurons gave up

their old style of long narrow huts made of bark and saplings, and took

to building, after the manner of the early French settlers, log and board

houses, shortly after their removal (the last in the series) to Jeune Lorette,

that is between the years 1700 and 1720. '^ Kalm, in 1749, found them

living in houses comprising each two rooms (kitchen and bedroom), but

very scantily furnished, so much so that the beds were left without sheets

or covering. The Hurons at night were content with wrapping them-

selves up in the blankets they had worn all day. They were provided with

stoves, says Franquet. but the heat they supplied only served to render

unbearable to all but Indians the tilthiness of the surroundings.'^

The clothing in use by the Hurons of Lorette is the same as that

of the French Canadian working classes. The old Huron style of

dress, even that of the later period, has been abandoned. I was able to

discover one member only of the band, a Huron lady in the nineties,

who still retained the traditional costume of the last century : the short

skirt, with the ' mitasses ' (leggings) and the moccasins. The costumes

in which the ' warriors ' and chiefs parade on exceptionally solemn occa-

sions, are almost wholly artificial in their make-up. Ordinary cloth and

printed calicoes are used for the purpose, and in the ornamentation of the

various parts no trace is seen of the mythical and symbolic forms charac-

teristic of the primitive art of the Huron-Iroquois. Kalm and Franquet,
about the middle of the last century, found the Huron women of

Lorette still clinging to the old Huron form of dress ; but the men,

though usually wearing the blanket, at times would don articles of dress

borrowed from the French.^

Notwithstanding the close grouping of the houses in the village,

the hygienic conditions at Lorette are fairly good ; a result due in great
part to the measures taken by the village council and the people themselves

for the sanitation of the surroundings. There has been much admixture

of foreign blood. For several generations past the Hurons have inter-

married with the whites, principally with the French Canadians. The

Huron physical type has been greatly altered, but not entirely blotted

out. The massive build and high stature which, we are told, were preva-

lent features among the old Hurons, are not now common at Lorette
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

neither are the cheek bones and nose unduly prominent, as a rule ; but

the rather dark olive complexion, the almond-shaped eyes, and the stiff

flat hair are often observed, and perhaps more so in very young children

than in the grown-up people.

The amusements indulged in are largely the same as those of the

AFrench Canadians in the neighbourhood.        typical initiative on the part

of the young men of Lorette was the organising among themselves and

equipping of a brass band. The numerous dances which were still gone

through on all great occasions, about the middle of the last century,* have

long since been forgotten. Shooting the arrow was a favourite sport with

the Huron boys, even up to the early years of the nineteenth century. No

more is seen of it now. Even lacrosse, the Huron national game, which
has become the favourite sport of so many Canadians, is no longer played

at Lorette.

               Village and State,

     Lorette is not well provided with the elements which give variety and
activity to village life, and help to build up the framework of municipal
government. The employers of labour are very few, and nearly all out-
siders, French or Scotch Canadians. In the same way the bulk of the

trade which is done at Lorette in connection both with the provisioning

of the families and the output of their industries (the smaller class of

Indian fancy wares excepted) is carried on by their white neighbours of

St. Ambroise.

     There is, however, a very notable departure from this condition of

things in the enterprise shown by Mr. Maurice Bastien, of Huron descent,

who operates the largest hide-dressing and moccasin and snowshoe-
making establishment in and about Lorette, and at times gives employ-

ment to some fifty people. In other respects also does Mr. Bastien set a

good example for his kinsmen to follow. He is almost a total abstainer

from alcoholic beverages. He has bought and partly cleared and improved

some fifty arpencs of land adjoining the village plot, on which he now cuts

every year about 20 tons of hay, reaps about 150 bushels of oats and

buckwheat, pastures nine cows and some horses. An interesting

experiment which he is carrying on for the firm of Renfrew, fur dealers,

of Quebec, is the breeding of butt'aloes from stock obtained in the State of

New York. Mr. Bastien proposes to have one or two of his sons to take
Aup agriculture as a means of livelihood.
                                           further proof of his spirit of

enterprise and progress is the building, at his own expense, of a system

of waterworks whereby each family in the Huron village is enabled to

secure in its own house, at the low rate of four dollars per annum, an

abundant supply of pure water.
     Education does not provide more leaders than do industry and com-

merce. The school for girls and that for boys are each under the care of
a female teacher paid by the Canadian Government. The school house

is built on the site, and partly out of the material of the priest's house
erected by the Jesuits in the early years of the eighteenth century. The

progress at school of the girls is said to be satisfactory, that of the

boys not so. There are very few persons of culture, or even ordinary

education, at Lorette. The professional men whose services may be

required all reside in neighbouring villages. Mr. Paul Picard, a retired

Civil Service employe of the Quebec Government, and the son of a noted

Huron chief, resides here. He was employed as a diaughtsman, and at
one time was a public notary. He is particularly well informed on the

history of the Huron community, and a staunch defender of the rights of

his kinsmen.

   A feature of Lorette is its quaint little church, the greater part of which

dates hack to 1730.' There is no resident missionary, but the parish priest

of St. Ambroise, near by, ministers to the religious welfare of the Huron

community. An early morning service is held every Sunday and a

sermon preached. The singing and preaching are done in French, The

               ' L. St. G, Lindsay, B.mic Canadienne, 1900, p. 1?2.
56G REPORT-- 1900.

priest receives an allowance of 225 dollars from the Canadian Govern-
ment for his services in this connection.

     Five chiefs (one head chief and four second or sub-chiefs) manage the
public affairs of the Huron community under the supervision of the
Department of Indian Affairs. These chiefs in council frame regulations

for the maintenance of order, the repression of intemperance and pro-

fligacy, the care of public health, the construction and repairs of school
houses and other public buildings, the locating of land on the reserve,
&c. They are elective, and their term of office is for three years.

     The above system of government is not the traditional one of the
Hurons. It was introduced in recent years by the Canadian Government

under the provisions of the Indian Act.' In former years the Hurons

elected six chiefs or more : one grand chief, one second chief, two council

chiefs, and two chiefs of the warriors. These chiefs were elected for life.

If we go still further back, to the seventeenth century, we see that the

ancient Hurons had many chiefs ; war chiefs and chiefs entrusted with

various    administrative                                                                                        functions                                             and  all were to  a  certain    extent
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

hereditary and to a certain extent elective.^

At the present time the head chief of the Hurons of Lorette (elected

quite recently) is Frangois Gros-Louis. Maurice Bastien, Gaspard Picard,
Maurice Tsioui are three of the sub-chiefs.

     The Hurons of Lorette are under the tutelage of the State. Their
landed property is held in trust for them by the Department of Indian
Aff"airs. The latter also has the management of the revenue derived
from part of these lands, and out of which expenses of a public character
are to be paid. The Department is kept informed, and generally acts
through an agent, who resides on the reservation-- Mr. A. 0. Bastien, an
intelligent and educated Huron.

There has been of late years much dissatisfaction and strife in the

AHuron community over the management of public affairs.                                                                                                                                           party, con-

sisting chiefly of a large number of the Tsiouis, think they have not had

their proper share of tha funds. They find fault with the chiefs, the
agent, and the Department as well. They refuse to attend meetings,

to take part in elections, and are intent on electing chiefs of their own.

   A remarkable fact is that the Hurons as a whole show no desire of

being enfranchised. Even the malcontents scorn the idea. Under

present conditions the Government meets all expenses in connection with
church and school and other matters. Practically they have no taxes to
pay, not even roads to maintain, the way-leave over the reserve being
granted to residents of neighbouring parishes on condition that they
take charge of the road. Enfranchisement, they say, would only add to
their burdens and render them more liable to be swindled out of their
property by the more unscrupulous of their white neighbours.

Before concluding, it will be of interest to make a rapid review of the

influences which, acting on the primitive Huron type, brought it to its

present stage of social transformation. These influences may be classed

under  three  heads                                            (1)                                               Early  trade                                          relations  with   the  French     and

1. The first series of influences (commercial intercourse and religious

preaching) exerted themselves over the ancient Hurons previous to their

leaving their old abode in Westei'n Ontario. Commerce introduced into

the Huron villages by the early French discoverers, or, at least, greatly

developed by them, upset the balance of the traditional system of 'labour

of the Hurons, by reducing the relative importance of agriculture as a

means of livelihood for them. Thereby the Hurons were rendered less

sedentary, more nomadic, less apt to fortify their villages and to hold

the country against invaders. The young and able-bodied men were kept

much away from home by their hunting and trading expeditions, leaving

the towns insufficienuly protected against attack, while themselves heavily

laden with furs or other goods, but scantily equipped with arms and

ammunition, fell an easy prey to Iroquois war parties.

Again, commerce, by reducing the importance of agriculture in the

labour system of the Hurons, weakened the clan organisation, on which

the whole Wyandot social fabric rested. Female clanship was dependent

for its strength on the social prestige of the women and this in turn was
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

largely dependent on the development of agriculture, which was left to

their charge.^ The preaching of the new religious dogmas by the RecoUet

and Jesuit missionaries and the conversion to the faith of a number of

the Hurons also tended to undo the binding action of clanship. For

clanship in its origin was blended with the religious beliefs of these

primitive people                                                                each clan  was  under the special protection of  a  pagan
                                                                             ;

myth, and the preaching of the Gospel released the hold which these

myths had on the minds of the Hurons. In that way were the strong

family ties which bound together the scattered parts of the "Wyandot

confederacy loosened, and the Hurons rendered less capable of strong

united action. In that way were the Iroquois enabled to defeat one after

the other the disconnected groups and bring about the utter dispersal of

the Huron nation. Such is the social significance of the facts set forth in

the early accounts.^

Of the five or six tribes, or suboi'dinate nations, which made up the

Wyandot confederacy, only three (the nation of the Bear, that of the

ARock, and that of the Rope) repaired towards Quebec.                                           few years later

two of these tribes were forced by the Mohawks and the Onondagas to

join their respective nations ; and the nation of the Rope was finally the
only one to remain with the French.^ From this sole tribe, very much

disorganised and reduced in numbers, and still fui'ther reduced by sub-

sequent wars, did the present Lorette community spring.

2. The physical features of the country about and back of Quebec,

characterised by the restricted area of the arable belt and the development

of the mountain and forest tract, had the effect of keeping the small
Huron group away from agriculture, of turning it more completely towards

the chase and those industries dependent on the chase and the forest for

their raw material. Thereby the Hurons were prevented from acquiring

any greater fitness for heavy and steady labour, and from developing any

greater ability or desire to hold land.

     3. The close neighbourhood and competition of the white settlers had

two quite distinct effects on the Hurons. On the one hand, their influence

united with that of physical environment in checking the agricultural

development of the Hurons and retaining them in the lower forms of

labour and property. On the other hand these conditions of close inter-

--course with the white settlers brought about by the reduced area of the
--Lorette holdings transformed the home-life, and in the end materially

improved the entire mode of living, of the Hurons.

     The Iroquois community, settled at Caughnawaga, in the vicinity of

Montreal, provides an interesting subject of comparison ; for, though origi-
nally of the same social type as the Hurons, their evolution in recent times

has been in quite the opposite direction.

     In conclusion, the greatest weakness in the social organisation of the

Hurons, and the one which should be remedied first, is that resulting from

Antheir property conditions.                                                                                  ever-recurring theme of conversation

among young and old at Lorette is the endless series of their grievances,

all more or less connected with property rights : grievances against the

Jesuits for having dispossessed them, or allowed them to be dispossessed,

of their seigniory of Sillery grievances against the British Government
                                                                                                      ;

for not having restored them to their rights after the conquest grievances
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

against some of their deceased chieftains, for having laid hands, so they

declared, on parts of the common land grievances also against some of
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

                                                                                                                                                                       ;

grievances against the Provincial Government for invading their hunting

grounds                                        and, finally, grievances against the Federal Government and its

agent for alleged maladministration of the reserves and the revenues

therefrom. The limited extent and collective ownership of the holdings

have had the effect, not only of helping to keep the Hurons away from

agriculture and bringing about over-density of population in the village,

but also of concentrating the minds and energies of individuals on petty

common rights and privileges (to the detriment of initiative in more

fruitful pursuits) and of breeding a harmful spirit of discontent.

     It seems that much would be done for the betterment of the condition

and the more normal development of these Hurons were it found possible

to carry out the plan suggested by Sir James Kempt as far back as 1830,

and further recommended by the Government Commissioners in 1847
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

that is, if land in the vicinity of Lorette and suitable for agriculture were,

on pi'oper terms, put at the disposal of the Hurons, on which some of them

at least, under intelligent and kindly supervision, might be made to acquire

proficiency in farming and aptness for the management of property. Thus

would they become a less dependent, a more contented and prosperous

community.

    of Professor J. B. Farmer (Chairman), Professor E. W. Phillips

     (Secretary), Professor F, 0. Bower, and Professor Harvey

      Gibson,

The Committee learn from Mr. J. Lloyd Williams, to whose assistance

they have again devoted the whole of the grant of 20^. placed at their
disposal, that during the past year he has investigated the following

subjects :

     1. The germination of the zoospores has been studied in Laminaria,
Alaria, and Chorda. Some interesting additions have been made to
our knowledge of reproduction in the Laminariacese, and particularly of

the cytology of the process. Incidentally the medullary tissues of the
above and of other genera of the family have been studied.

     2. The life-history and cytology of Dictyota have been further studied.
Additional notes will be presented to the meeting of the Association, and

the full results will be published during the winter. Taenia, Padina,
and Haliseris are being studied for comparison.

     3. The study of the life-history and cytology of Ilalidrys has been
completed, and the results are awaiting publication. The cytology of
the reproductive process in Himanthalia and Cystoseira is being investi-

gated.

     4. The natural history of the Fucacere has been further studied, and
it is hoped to publish the observations before the end of the year.

     5. The study of the nuclei of the reproductive cells of the Ecto-
carpacese has been commenced, with a view of ascertaining whether there
is reduction of chromosomes at any stage.

      6. Cultures of nearly all of the above are carried on in the laboratory,
and careful record kept of their relation to light, heat, air, and pressure.

     Your Committee are of opinion that Mr. Williams is doing excellent
work, and that the grant has been wisely used.

      Mr. Williams hopes to bring some of his observations on the germi-

 nation of the zoospores of Lamiuariacete before the notice of the Section
 at Bradford.

on Vegetable Assimilation and Respiration.

     Enough progress has been made in various directions to allow of the
results being brought forward, and the author is engaged in preparing
them for publication. The first to appear will be those treating of (1)
the influence of the available amount of plastic substances on respiration

This being the last year of the century, the Corresponding Societies
Committee of the British Association think it a suitable occasion for a
brief review of the proceedings which have taken place at the Conferences
of Delegates of the Corresponding Societies since they were reconstituted in
the year 1883. The Report of the ' Local Scientific Societies Committee,'
stating that ' the delegates of the various Corresponding Societies shall
constitute a Conference,' &c., appears in the Repoi-t of the British Asso-
ciation for 1884 ; the first Conference of Delegates officially recognised as
a department of the Association was held at Aberdeen in 1885, and a
report of its proceedings is given in the Birmingham volume (1886).^
Thence to, and including, the year 1893 the Reports of the Conferences
are one year behind. Thus the discussions at the Edinburgh meeting in
1892 are given in the Nottingham volume of 1893. But in the Oxford
volume (1894) appear Reports of the Conferences held both at Nottingham
and at Oxford ; and since 1894 the Reports of the Conferences of Dele-

gates may be found in the Report of the British Association for the year

in which they occurred. The chief subjects considered at the Conferences
are here given, ordinary sectional discussions being noticed when they
were the only discussions of the Conference.

and as some Delegates were not present during the discussion, copies of
the following letter were sent to every Delegate nominated to the Dovey
Conference ;

  --Dear Sir, At the second meeting of the Conference of Delegates at

Dover, September 19, a discussion took place as to the best means of
improving the proceedings at these meetings. It was ultimately decided
that any recommendations from the Delegates on that matter, if sent in
not later than November 7, would be considered by the Corresponding
Societies Committee at their meeting later in that mouth,

                                                             I am, dear Sir,

                                                                    Yours truly,

                                                                                  T. V. Holmes,

                                                            Sec, Cor. Soc. Com. Brit. Assoc.

     When the Corresponding Societies Committee met on November 24,

1899, twelve replies to the above letter had been received from the

representatives of fourteen societies; and in March 1900 some addi-

tional recommendations were received from the Yorkshire Naturalists

Union.

     The various suggestions mostly deal either with proposed alterations

in the times of meeting, with the desii-ability of a room in which Delegates

might hold informal discussions between the meetings of the Conference,

or with improvements in the proceedings at the Conference.

     As regards the days and hours on which the Conferences have hitherto

been held, the Committee found it so difficult to suggest any others which

might not prove to be accompanied by still greater disadvantages that

they have refrained from proposing any alteration in them.

     The Committee considered it not desirable to propose to alter the rule

of the British Association that only members, not associates, can become

Delegates.

     The Committee agreed that it is desirable when possible that a room

shall be provided at the Bradford and other future meetings of the

Association, in which Delegates may meet, become acquainted with each

other, and hold informal cliscussions between the meetings of the Con-

ference.

     As regards a suggestion that an agenda paper should be sent to the

Corresponding Societies some time before the British Association meeting

in order that Delegates might come better prepared to the Conference,

it was decided that although the circular issued in Jul}' is inter alia an

agenda paper, it would be well to add a clause to it asking that the

Secretary of each Corresponding Society receiving it should bring the

subjects for discussion at the Conference before the notice of the Delegate

of the Society.

     It was also decided by the Committee that the circular drawn up

some years ago by Dr. Garson stating the rules respecting the Corre-

sponding Societies and the advantages granted to them should be reprinted

and  sent  to  the  Corresponding  Societies  in  March                              and  that  at the
                                                                                  ;

                       First Conference, Bradford, September 6, 1900.

     The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Prof.
E. B. Poulton (Chairman), Rev. J. O. Bevan, Dr. Garson, Mr. J. Hopkin-
son, and Mr, T. V. Holmes (Secretary).

     The Report of the Corresponding Societies Committee, a copy of which
was in the hands of every Delegate present, was taken as read.

     The Chairman remarked that all present must have received the
agenda paper, and have noted that the subject for discussion that day
consisted of two resolutions which had been brought forward by the
Yorkshire Naturalists' Union. In the Report then circulated there were
comments bearing on the subjects of these resolutions which the
Committee wished should be discussed thoroughly on that occasion.

     The resolutions were :

     1. That the Conference of Delegates be allowed to meet on the first

day of the British Association Meeting, and make their own arrangements

for subsequent meetings and order of business.
     2. That it is desirable, in order to make the discussions of the

Conference of Delegates more useful to the local Societies, that they
should have the power of deciding the subjects for discussion at the
meetings of the Conference, and it is suggested, therefore, that a circular
be sent by the Committee every year to each of the Corresponding
Societies, asking them to send a list of subjects for discussion (not more
than two or three) at the forthcoming meetings. The Committee then
to send to the Corresponding Societies a schedule containing the titles of
all the subjects proposed for discussion, asking each Society to mark such
of these subjects as it deems most desirable to discuss at the Conference

meetings. On receipt of this information the Committee will then

arrange the list of subjects in order of precedence as indicated by the
support given to each subject by the Societies ; and a copy of this should
be sent to the Delegates or Societies as an agenda paper before the first
meeting of the Delegates.

     Mr. Harold Wager, representing the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union,
which comprises a large number of local Societies, said that the Union
had called together a committee consisting of a number of their more
prominent members, and they had formulated the two resolutions, copies
of which had been distributed. It was considered most important that

the representatives of the local Societies should, if possible, themselves
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  575

suggest the subjects for discussion. Much good work had been done at
these Conferences, but those whom he represented thought that if direct

suggestions from the local Societies were invited, the wants of the Societies
would be more advantageously considered than they had been in the past,
and that they would come into closer touch with each other.

     Staff-Commander Dubois Phillips, Pi..N., thought that the resolutions
.somewhat contradicted each other. According to the first resolution, the
Delegates were to meet on the first day of the meeting of the British

Associcition, and make their own arrangements for subsequent meetings
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and the second resolution laid down hard and fast lines with regard to
the subjects for discussion and their order. The opinion of the Council
of the Society he represented was that Delegates should not come there to

discuss subjects such as could be discussed in the various Sections, but

that the Conferences should rather be business meetings to consider
questions such as that of copyright. It would be a very good thing to

ascertain the views of the various Societies as to the best subjects for

discussion. He thought that if the first Conference took place on the

first day of the British Association meeting very few Delegates would be

present at it.

     Mr. J. Hopkinson said that many of the proposals contained in the
resolutions had already been carried out. Last March a circular was sent

to each Corresponding Society asking it to send to the Corresponding
Societies Committee a list of subjects for discussion at the Bradford Con-

ference. Why, therefore, should there be a resolution stating that this

should be done 1 Only one Society had responded to this invitation by

suggesting a subject for discussion. And Mr. T. V. Holmes added that

the one subject sent in (Dew-ponds) would be discussed at the second

Conference.

      Mr. Hopkinson remarked that the first day of the British Associa-
tion meeting would be an exceedingly awkward time for the first
Conference on account of the meeting of the General Committee, and of

the delivery of the President's Address on that day. And not only was

 that day impracticable for the first Conference, but it would also be impos-
sible to arrange then what should be done subsequently. Arrangements of
this kind must be made months beforehand. In his opinion the first resolu-
 sion was impracticable, while, as regards the second, the most important
parts of it had already been carried out by the Corresponding Societies

 Committee.
      Dr. Garson said that practically Thursday was the first day of the

 British Association meeting, and that very few Delegates were ever likely
 to be present at a meeting on Wednesday. The Corresponding Societies
 Committee were always glad to get assistance from the Delegates in the
 choice of subjects for discussion, and the complaint of the Committee
 had long been that the local Societies did not take a sufficiently active part

 in such matters.

      Mr. G. P. Hughes could not agree with the first resolution, as members

 often arrived late on Wednesday. He thought some of the stipulations

 in the second resolution should be adopted.

      Mr. William Gray said that the main object of these Conferences was
 to encourage local Societies so as to make their local arrangements to
 promote the chief object of the British Association, the advancement of
 science. The British Association should jDoint out what matters they
 wished the local Societies to investigate. At the first meeting of the
 5?5 REPORT-- 1900.

 Conference the Bi'itisih Association Committee should receive a feport
 from each of the Societies, and at the next meeting the Delegates should

 have an opportunity of making suggestions. At the opening Conference
 the British Association Committee should learn how far the local

 organisations were competent to conduct the investigations put before

 them by the Association. At the second the Delegates should consult
 among themselves as to the best way in which any deficiencies pointed

 out at the first meeting might be remedied.

      Mr. Eli Sowerbutts remarked that the Delegates had not hitherto had

 sufficient opportunities of becoming acquainted with each other. He had

 been a Delegate about fifteen years, and knew, perhaps, four of the other
 Delegates. It was seldom that the same Delegate came year after year.

 He thought the simplest thing would be to pass the first resolution and to

 omit the second, though somewhat doubtful whether the result of passing
 the first resolution would be of any importance. But he wished a room
 to be recognised during the meetings of the Association as one in which
 the Delegates might meet informally, sit, chat, or write their letters
betvveen the formal Conferences. The Societies they represented might
then combine for mutual assistance, and they, the Delegates, might also
more efficiently aid the work of the Association.

      Mr. T, V. Holmes wished to call attention to the paragraph at the
bottom of the third page of the Report in their hands : ' The Committee
agree that it is desiralile, when possible, that a room shall be provided
at the Bradford and other future meetings of the Association in which
Delegates may meet, become acquainted with each other, and hold

informal discussions between the meetings of the Conference.' He had

to add that the room in which they were then assembled was that in
Avhich the Delegates might meet at any time.

     Mr. Wager proposed a vote of thanks to the local Committee for
providing the room. The motion was seconded by Stafl'-Commander

Phillips and carried unanimously.

    Mr. W. Bayley Marshall formally moved that the meetings of the

Conference be held as heretofore on Thursday and Tuesday. There
would then be fixed days of meeting, and the Delegates could arrange to
attend accordingly'.

    Mr. Hembry seconded the motion. He thought it might be possible

for the Corresponding Societies Committee to arrange with other Com-

mittees that no important business should be transacted elsewhere during

the meetings of the Conference.

     The ( 'hairman remarked that they would do their best.

     Mr. Hembry added that Delegates did not always receive communica-

tions intended for them which were sent to the Secretaries of local

Societies. He thought it would be a good plan to send to the Delegate of

this year notices referring to next year, because in all probability the
Delegate of this year would be selected next year. If not, he could hand

on to his successor the papers he had received. He considered that an

addition might be made to the second resolution to the effect that a

circular be sent every year to each of the Corresponding Societies and to

the Delegate of the present year.

   A Delegate who had been instructed by his Society to support the

resolutions of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, supposed that the mover
of the resolutions did not mind whether their first meeting was on

Wednesday or Thursday. An amendment which he desired to move was
       CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.                                      577

that the first meeting should be on Thursday, and that the Conference of

Delegates should then decide themselves the dates of the subsequent

meetings.

    Professor Henry Louis seconded the amendment.
    Mr. Vaughan Cornish thought that business discussions rather than
scientific papers were required. Not two, but three, bodies were trying

--to do business together the Corresponding Societies Committee, the

Corresponding Societies, and the Delegates. His opinion was that it
would be well for the Committee to recognise the Delegates rather than

the Societies.

     Dr. Abbott said that it occui-red to him that the Delegates might meet
on Thursday morning at a breakfast. There was little probability that
any other social function could be arranged. The Committee should

encourage the formation of Unions of Local Societies.
    Mr, Barrowman favoured the proposition that the Conference at its

first meeting should arrange the following meetings.
     The Chairman remarked that it was evident that the Conference did

not wish to listen to papers such as might be brought before the Sections
of the Association. They desired rather to discuss the methods of pro-

cedure which would make local Societies successful. The Committee were

in general agreement with the spirit of the two resolutions. He gathered

from certain remarks which had been made that the local Societies were
often to blame for not giving Delegates copies of circulars sent by the

Committee to the Secretaries of the Societies long before the British

Association meetings took place. The present days for the Conference
seemed to be the best that could be chosen, and they had the advantage
of being known beforehand. The debate had been most useful in showing

the nature of the questions which the Delegates desired to discuss at these

Conferences.

    Mr. W. Gray said that the local Societies did not do their duties

adequately because those duties were not clearly defined by the British

Association Committee. He thought that the Committee should ascertain

at the first Conference each year how far each Society had acted in
accordance with the requirements of the Committee. The proceedings at

the second Conference might be settled by the Delegates themselves.

The Chairman remarked that the new questions which had been raised

should have been sent in months ago when the resolutions of the Yorkshire

ANaturalists' Union were received by the Committee.  discussion on

them might be initiated under a heading such as ' What are the aims and

scope of a local Society 1

    Mr. W. Gray thought that the grant of a room in which Delegates

might meet at any time was an immense advantage, which might remove

altogether the necessity for a second meeting.

Mr. T. V. Holmes (Secretary) stated that in consequence of the discussion

at Dover as to the best ways of improving the proceedings at the Con-

ferences of Delegates, he wrote to the thirty-seven Delegates inviting

suggestions which could be placed before the Committee a month later,

but received answers only from twelve.

The Chairman said that, as he believed, the British Association did-

not intend that local Societies should work on any special or peculiar

lines in relation to itself. The Association wished that local Societies

.ihould do local work, and endeavoured to assist them by means of these

Conferences, by the exchange of its Report for their .Proceedings, and

by publishing in its Report the titles of papers read before and published

by the Societies.
     Mr. H. Wager, after briefly reviewing the discussion, remarked that

though the i-esolutions had secured a considerable amount of general
acceptance, he did not think it desirable to put them formally to the

meeting.

     The Chairman agreed to this course, which he considered to be the

best under the circumstances. He thought that the discussion would prove

to be very useful.

    Mr. W. Gray proposed, and Staff-Commander Phillips seconded, a vote

of thanks to the Corresponding Societies Committee for providing the
room in which they were assembled for informal intercourse between the
Delegates. It was carried unanimously. The motion proposed by Mr.
Bayley Marshall, and seconded by Mr. Hembry, ' That the meetings of
the Conference be held as heretofore on Thursday and Tuesday,' was also

carried.

                                    Copyright.

    M)'. Walton Brown brought forward the question of copyright. Lord

Monksweil had introduced into Parliament a Bill dealing with the

subject, and, so far as scientific Societies were concerned, the Bill ignored

some important points. In the first place there was no provision that

a Society should have any copyright in the publication of its own Trans-

actions, though he believed Societies might obtain copyright if they paid

their contributors. He had offered to give evidence before the Com-

mittee considering this Bill, but the Committee replied that they accepted
his evidence, and did not think it necessary to examine him. Then the

Bill proposed to make the insertion of abstracts of foreign scientific
papers a breach of copyright ; an innovation that would weigh heavily on
several scientific Societies which made a special point of publishing

abstracts.

    Mr. Sowerbutts thought that this was one of the most important

matters that had ever been discussed at a Conference. Copyright ques-

tions  were  extremely  involved,   and  difficult  to    understand                                                but   there
                                                                                                                 ;

could be no doubt of the injustice of the present state of things, and that

it would be confirmed by the Bill then before Parliament. The expense

of printing papers was by no means a slight one.

    Professor Henry Louis pointed out that the British Association dis-

claimed copyright for itself. It was, however, a matter of vital import-

ance to each Society represented at that Conference.

     After some remarks from the Rev. J. O. Bevan and the Chairman,
the following resolution, moved by Mr. M. Walton Brown and seconded

by Mr. Sowerbutts, was carried unanimously :

    ' That the matter of the proposed Copyright Bill be referred, through

the Committee of Recommendations, to the General Committee, so far as

it  affects (1)  the copyright  of  scientific Societies  in  their                          Transactions
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and (2) the publication  of     abstracts of  scientific  papers                             and                    that  they
                                                                                          ;

be requested to take such action as will protect scientific Societies.' '

    The Conference then adjourned.

     ' The resolution was by an accident not sent to the Committee of Recommendations,
but it has been arranged that it shall be brought before the Council for consideration.

       Second Meeting of the Conference, September 1 1

The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Mr. W.

Whitaker (Vice-Chairman), Rev. J. O. Bevan, Dr Horace T. Brown, Dr.

Garson, Mr. J. Hopkinson, and Mr. T. V. Holmes (Secretary).

   CThe Chairman briefly introduced Professor L.  Miall, who read the

--following Address :

       Dew-ponds. By Professor L. C. Miall, F.R.8.

I lately undertook a new edition (the 83rd or 84th) of White's ' Natural

History of Selborne,' and found it necessary to consider the account of

the Hampshire dew-ponds which is to be found in Letter XXIX. tu

WeBarrington. '  have,' he says, ' many such little round ponds in this

district, and one in particular on our sheep-down, three hundred feet

above my house, which, though never above three feet deep in the middle,

and not more than thirty feet in diameter, and containing perhaps not

more than two or three hundred hogsheads of water, yet is never known

to fail, though it affords drink for three hundred or four hundred sheep,

and for at least twenty head of large cattle beside.' This account, of

which I quote one sentence only, led me to inquire a little into this

curious subject by correspondence, by reference to the rather scanty

Myliterature which already exists, and by personal visits.   inquiries

are, I must admit, very imperfect, but they may be the means of inducing

people whose opportunities are better than mine to collect fuller informa-

tion.

White's account of the dew-ponds of Hampshire is largely confirmed

Aby more recent observation.  good description of such ponds is to be

found in a prize essay on ' Water Supply,' by the Rev. J. C. Clutterbuck.

He says that the tops of chalk hills, where no surface-water or springs

can furnish a supply, are often chosen as the sites of dew-ponds.

They ' are constructed by persons of experience and skill. At the spot

selected an excavation is made in the surface of the chalk, either round or

rectangular, from thirty to forty feet or more in diameter, from four to six

feet deep. The bottom, of a basin shape, is covered in portions with clay

carefully tempered,^ mixed with a considerable quantity of lime to prevent

the working of the earthworms.'-^ As the portions are finished they are

protected from the action of the sun and atmosphere by a covering of

straw. When the whole bottom of the pond is so covered with an efficient

and impermeable coating or puddle a layer of broken chalk is placed upon

it to prevent its injury by cattle or other means. Their cost varies from

When30^. to 50^.  all is finished water is introduced by artificial means.

If there is a fall of snow this is collected and piled up in the pond as the

readiest and least expensive method of accomplishing the object. . . . Ponds
so constructed and filled have been known for periods of twenty or thirty

years never to become dry. The summer of 1864 was a notable exception.'

Dew-ponds are often dug on the very ridge of a down, or else by

choice on the northern slope, which is the inland slope in most of the

     ' Chalk-puddle is occasionally used instead, but is believed to be less efficient
and less durable.

    - It may be doubted whether the purpose of the lime is to prevent the working
of earthworms, which cannot live beneath a pond. It is an old practice to spread

wet clay with lime in the belief that it prevents slipping.
                                                                                                                  PP2

south-eastern counties. It is generally held that moist winds throw down

their water most abundantly just beyond the summit of the first range of

hills which they meet. In the case of the downs of Hampshire and

Sussex the inland slope has the further advantage of being sheltered from

the sun and all the warmer winds, so that it is the fitter for the con-

densation of water-vapour.

Mr. Clutterbuck believes that dew-ponds are ' not easily accounted for

by recognised physical causes.' It is plain that the water which collects

on the summit of a chalk-down is not drawn from springs, for the

saturation -level is hundreds of feet below. Nor is it due in any important

Ameasure to surface-drainage.  small collecting area is furnished by the

Amargin of the pond, but this rarely equals the water-surface.       dew-

pond may occupy the summit of the ridge so precisely that there can be no

collecting ground worth speaking of.

     Hales's view (quoted by White) that more than twice as much dew is

deposited upon water as upon an equal surface of moist earth cannot be

accepted as it stands. He does not take into account circumstances

which may greatly affect the rate of cooling, and consequently the amount

of condensation, such as the depth of the water. It may often be observed,

for instance, that when a copious dew has been deposited upon the seats

of an open boat none is to be seen on the bottom. Contact with a large

body of insufficiently cooled water (as of a deep lake) has kept the bottom

of the boat at a temperature above the dew-point.

    Water is so bad a conductor of heat that some difficulty may be found

in understanding how a pond can cool sufficiently during a summer night

to act as an efficient condenser. But though water conducts heat very

badly, every surface layer, as it cools by radiation, becomes denser, and

sinks. Continual replacement of the surface layer by convection-currents

may thus cool down the water as effectually as if the heat were freely

Aconducted away.       shallow pond on a hill-top may in the course of a

few hours become cold enough to act as an efficient condenser.

Water vapour, liquid water, and ice are all good absorbents of dark

heat-rays ; it may be inferred that they are good radiators of dark heat-
rays. This perhaps does not admit of experimental proof. The radiation
from water in a pond is complicated by so many circumstances, such as

the absorption of heat by the water vapour whicli the pond gives off, and

the sinking of the water as it cools, that no determination by direct

methods is possible.

There is a good deal of testimony to the effect that a dew-pond

prospers best with a depth of about 4 feet. If it is deeper it shrinks to

such depth as will cool down during a short summer night, i.e. about

i feet ; if it is nmch shallower it dries up altogether in a drought. This

account, though probable in itself, needs to be scrutinised further. I

know as yet of no facts to the contrary, and several in its favour.

Dew-ponds abound in Sussex and Hampshire, and are not uncommon

on the chalk hills of Berkshire and Wiltshire. But on the chalk hills of

Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire few or none are

to be found. This may be connected with the distance from the sea in a

N.E.-S.W. line. The S.W. winds, which bring the chief part of our

atmospheric moisture, can reach the South Downs almost direct from the

sea, while they can only reach the chalk hills of the Midlands and the

North of England after traversing a great extent of country and crossing

many ranges of hills.
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  581

    The few that have been mentioned to me as occurring in the Midland

counties all turned out on inquiry to depend obviously on surface
drainage, usually from a hollow in a neighbouring hard road. It is thus
with the ' meres ' of Derbyshire which appear, from such information as I
have been able to procure, to be always fed from adjacent collecting
grounds. If any one can furnish an unexceptionable example of a true dew-
pond on a chalk-down, or other hill, which is distant a hundred or even
fifty miles from the south coast, the news would be welcome.

     Those who believe that dew-ponds in all cases owe their existence to
rainfall alone (and among these was that eminent meteorologist, the late
G. J. Symons, F.R.S.) bold that, owing to elevation, the temperature of

the water in such ponds is very nearly coincident with the dew-point, so

that evaporation and condensation balance each other. Whether such a
temperature of the water is regularly maintained day and night through-

out a season of drought cannot, I believe, be established by existing
thermometric observations. I doubt whether it can be established by

general reasoning. Before we can accept the view that dew-ponds are
replenished by rain alone, we must refute or explain two facts, both of
which are supported by strong testimony :

     1. That dew-ponds do not dry up when the low-level ponds of the
same district are evaporated. Not only do the dew-ponds replace in some
way the loss due to evaporation, but they supply large flocks of sheep.
If it is contended that during summer droughts the hill -tops are regularly
visited by local clouds which are precipitated as rain, the frequency and

substantial yield of such clouds need to be better established than at

present.

     2. That dew-ponds cannot in the first instance be filled by rain (see
Mr. Clutterbuck's prize essay). This statement, if it can stand inquiry,
seems to be decisive against the sufficiency of rainfall.

    On the other hand the restriction of dew-ponds to an area quickly

and directly reached by south-west winds blowing from the sea, supports,

it would seem, the view that what we call dew-ponds are really rain-
ponds. Moisture-laden winds favour cloud-formation and rain, while we

have no reason to suppose that they favour dew-formation, but rather

the contrary.

     Mr. Clement Reid, F.R.S., of the Geological Survey, sums up his
wide experience of dew-ponds in these words :

     ' The conditions that are required for a permanent dew-pond do not
seem generally to be understood, failure or success appearing to be the
result of chance rather than of any clear comprehension of the principle

on which the dew-pond acts. On comparing, at the end of a long
drought, the dried-up ponds with those that still contain water, we find

that, other things being equal, the best dew-pond has the following

characteristics :

     ' It is sheltered on the south-west side by an overhanging tree, often
only a stunted ivy-covered thorn or oak, or by a bush of holly. Or else
the hollow is sufficiently deep for the south bank to cut off much of the
sun. The depth or shallowness of the water does not appear to make so
great a difi'erence as would be expected.

     ' The open downs, even in the middle of summer, receive much heavier
dews than would be expected, or than are met with on the lowlands.
582 KEPORT-- 1900.

Thick sea-mists often cling to their tops for several hours after sunrise,
·while the plains below are already dry and sunny. It is only by noticing
the large amount of moisture intercepted and dripping from the over-
hanging boughs as the sea-mist drifts slowly past that one can realise

how prolific a source this must be. The amount condensed in this way

might be tested by a rain-gauge of wide aperture.

    ' When one of these ponds is examined in the middle of a hot summer

day it would appear that the few inches of water in it could only last
a week. But in early morning or towards evening, or whenever a sea-
mist drifts in, there is a continuous drip from the smooth leaves of the
overhanging tree. There appears also to be a considerable amount of
condensation on the surface of the water itself, though roads adjoining

may be quite dry and dusty. In fact, whenever dew is on the grass, the

dew-pond is receiving moisture ; and this moisture, owing to the shade of
the overhanging tree, is partly preserved throughout the day ; so that

sheep or cattle may drink daily from a small shallow pond which receives

no rain, and yet the pond be not exhausted unless the nights are excep-

tionally dry.'

We Wenow want observations by the thermometer.             should be glad

to know the temperature of the water of the pond at various depths, as
taken hourly through a summer night ; the temperature of the surface

of the ground (free from grass) a few feet  away from the  pond                                        the tem-
                                                                                                    ;

perature of the air at various small heights above the hill-top, as well as

in a neighbouring valley ; and also the relative humidity of the air as

determined by wet and dry bulbs. If a small party would make such

observations during a few clear still nights in hot summer weather, some

Weblanks in our knowledge would be filled up at once.      should be glad

to know how the level of a dew-pond varies during a spell of sultry

weather. Observations on the clouds and mists of the summits of the

downs are also much to be desired. Day observations would have their

use too, and should not be omitted.

Is it too much to ask that residents in the south-eastern counties will

Ainvestigate these matters for us ?  party of a dozen meteorologists

who would choose a time of settled hot weather, and give a week to the

inquiry, would throw much light upon a question of considerable scientific

and practical importance.

While so many data are wanting, it would be unwise to express a

confident opinion as to the relative importance of rain and dew in the

supply of water to the ponds of the chalk downs. No scientific man will

willingly decide any question on indirect evidence if direct evidence can

be got.

     The Chairman remarked that they would all unite' in thanking

Professor Miall for bringing before them the subject of dew-ponds in so

complete a form. He should like to have a little further information as

to the habit of sprinkling with lime with the object of keeping out earth-

worms. He wished also to know on what grounds Professor Miall said that

evaporation from the surface of dew-ponds was slight. His own impres-
sion was that evaporation would be somewhat rapid. Professor Miall

had spoken of the limited area within which dew-ponds existed. It was
singular that this limited area was one of low rainfall. Dew-ponds were
numerous in Berkshire, where they were made in the way described by
Professor Miall. While the Hertfordshire chalk was largely covered by

clay with flints, the Berkshire chalk was not.

     Mr. Clement Reid said that the question of the water supply in dew-

ponds was, like many other questions of water supply, much mixed up

with curious ancient superstitious observances analogous to the use of the

divining rod. He did not think that dew-ponds were formed in anything
like the scientific manner pretended by their makers. He had been

working during the last few years in a country where dew-ponds were

particularly abundant, and there had been several successive years of
severe drought. Nearly all the more recently made dew-ponds were dried

up, but a number of the older ones had not dried up. He did not think

that the older ponds were better made than the newer ones, but that a

process leading to the survival of the fittest was always gding on. When

a dew-pond dried up a new one became necessary. The farmers were
constantly making new ones, and sometimes, by accident, they got a satis-

factoiy site. It was an unfortunate thing that they were almost entirely

without meteorological observations on the high ground, where dew-ponds

abounded, our rainfall stations being almost invariably at a low level.

As to the question of dew or mist he did not feel qualified to speak. He

wondered whether it was possible that the film of scum constantly seen
on the surface of dew-ponds had any influence in protecting the water

from evaporation. Dew -ponds, being entirely isolated from running

water, were very important from a biological point of view. They could
watch the population of a pond becoming more numerous and varied, and
note how the higher animals and plants took the place of the lower which
first appeared. Dew-ponds and other isolated ponds would give much
valuable information as to the rate of dispersal of the aquatic fauna and
584 REPORT-- 1900.

Hora of a district, and their7observation with this object was a matter

which might well be recommended to all local scientific Societies.

    Mr. Vaughan Cornish said that in Berkshire the dew-ponds were

frequently in open situations and not under trees. He would bi'ing the

matter before the notice of the Dorsetshire Field Club, and he hoped they

might be able to make some systematic observations on dew-ponds.

Mr. John Hopkinson noticed that Professor Miall held that the margin

of the jDond had very little effect in increasing the amount of rain col-

lected, but he believed that, as a rule, the area of the margin was at least

equal to that of the surface of the pond. There was thus twice the

area for rainfall that would be given if the water-covered surface alone

were reckoned. It was difficult to form an idea as to how water was

contributed to these ponds by dew, as dew would require a surface cooler

than the air oh which to condense, whilst the water in the pond would

usually cool more slowly than the air above it. The water being also

warmer than the surface of the ground surrounding it, dew would not

so readily condense on it. He believed that observations had been

made, but he was not aware that any one had actually seen the dew

accumulating on the side of a pond and trickling down into it. The

margin had certainly very little, if any, effect as regards the amount of

Adew received.  distinction must be drawn between dew and mist :

the latter would probably increase the amount of water in a pond. As

to the level of these ponds, he believed that it varied considerably from

time to time. Where there were trees overhanging the pond there would

be a considerable deposition of dew, but he thought that the majority of

these ponds were not surrounded by trees. As to evaporation from
tlie ponds, mist was to be seen at times rising from their surface. He

believed that the average rainfall where dew-ponds were situated was

between twenty-five and thirty inches per annum. But there were

scarcely any rain-gauges on the high ground where dew-ponds existed,

and there was probably more rain on the hills than in the valleys. He

did not know of any dew-ponds in Hertfordshire, though there was a

considerable area around Royston and Hitchin where there was bare

chalk. He thought the subject extremely interesting, and one which
might be profitably studied by the local Societies. Among other results

their investigations might some day enable farmers to fix upon the best

possible sites for their dew -ponds, and so prevent the waste of a consider-

able amount of money.

Mr. Clement Reid remarked that the ponds which had stood the severe

drought had generally trees on their margin.

     Mr. J. Brown said that in order to form an accurate estimate of what
was gomg on it would be necessary to consider the amount of water con-

sumed by the animals drinking at the pond. There were no dew ponds

in Ireland.

The Chairman remarked that dew-ponds were only made in a country

like that of the higher chalk districts, where the rocks were absolutely dry.

    Mr. W. Gray said that there was a great deal of superstition about

water, and some of the accounts of dew-ponds which never failed, &c.,

probably owed much to that source. There were wells in Ireland the

water of which it was said would not boil, and the people never used

it for cooking, because they thought that it would be useless for that

purpose. This notion evidently arose from the fact that the water from a

deep-seated source is of the same temperature in summer and winter, and
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  585

tlie inference of some people was that it would be of no use to attempt to
change the temperature artificially.

     Mr. W. M. Watts said that with regard to the mixture of lime with

clay in the sides of a dew-pond, he did not think that was necessary to
make them impervious ; but lime was frequently mixed with sandy
material to prevent it from slipping in the slope of a reservoir embank-
ment. With regard to the amount of dew, that could hardly exceed one
inch and a half per annum.

     Mr. James Barrowman was not aware that there were any dew-ponds
in Scotland. One point to be considered was whether the superficial area
of the pond had anything to do with its success.

     Mr. Hopkinson thought that it was of considerable importance in the
construction of these ponds that in the summer the receiving area was
usually more than double the evaporating area.

     Mr. G. P. Hughes said that dew-ponds were unknown in his district.
It occurred to him that they might prove useful in the future both in Aus-

--tralia and in South Africa dry countries where the dews were very heavy.

     The Rev. E. P. Knubley remarked that Wiltshire was a country of

dew-ponds. He suggested that all the Delegates should be supplied with

a list of questions, which they might attempt to answer by the date of the
next meeting.

     Professor Louis remarked that the exact composition of the water in
these dew-ponds was one of the essential points to be examined.

    Professor Potter said that in Warwickshire there were many ponds

which it was almost impossible to suppose could be fed by surface
drainage. In Suffolk there were a great number of small ponds which
formed the water-supply of villages, and were covered over and not
supplied by rain. In the south of Portugal there was a well-defined
wet season of short duration and a prolonged summer, in which no rain

fell at all. In that country there were many rock pools, and from the

scarcity of the rainfall and the excessive heat it was impossible to suppose
that these pools had been fed entirely by the rain.

     Professor Miall replied, and expressed the hope that the Corresponding
Societies would take up the subject and furnish additional information on
dew-ponds.

     The Chairman requested the Delegates to bring the subject before
their Societies. Mr. Vaughan Cornish remarked that he would see what
could be done in Hampshire and Berkshire to induce people to take the
matter up. The Rev. E. P. Knubley added that he would try to interest
some residents in Sussex.

                                                  Section C.

     Mr. Monckton, representing Section C, drew attention to the labours
of two Committees who wished to obtain the co-operation of the Cor-
responding Societies in their work, the Geological Photographs Committee

and the Erratic Blocks Committee. As regards geological photographs,

the county of Yorkshire and the scientific Societies of Yorkshire were
pre-eminently first in the work up to the present time. The number of
geological photographs in the British Association's collection was 2,655,
the number received during the past year being 309, In this list he did
not include a certain number of duplicates and lantern slides. It was so
obvious that the taking of geological photographs was a work which could
be most usefully done by members of the Societies that he need say
nothing more on that head. Then the Committee for the Investigation of
586 REPORT-- 1900.

the E)Tatic Blocks of the British Isles wished for the active co-operation

of the members of the Corresponding Societies. Indi\idual workers could

greatly aid this investigation, but the most effective assistance would be

given by the organisation of local Boulder Committees. He would there-

fore suggest that the Delegates should impress their respective Societies
with the importance of organising local Boulder Committees, and of com-
municating the results attained to the Erratic Blocks Committee. It
might be useful to add that the Secretary of the Geological Photographs

Committee is Professor W. W. Watts, and the Secretary of the Erratic

Blocks Committee Professor P. F. Kendall.

                      Section D.

DThe Rev. E. P. Knubley said that Section was anxious to encourage

the Corresponding Societies to go on observing birds, and especially the

Amigration of birds.  new light had been thrown on the migration of

birds by the observations of lighthouse and lightship keepers. Until

recently it was thought that all birds had the same lines of flight, but

now it was known that there were sevei'al. It was now known that the

common thrush went backwards and forwards from our islands during

about ten months of the year. It was found that the wagtail came

regularly along the western coast, but was unknown on the east. It was

desirable that they should learn how long the commonest English birds

sat upon their eggs before hatching them. No one at present could

answer that question. Then the subject of the food supply of birds was

one which might well be studied. The life histories of insects was also a

most interesting subject to work at.

                                                   Section E.

     Mr. Sowerbutts said that he had some suggestions to make, though he

could not precisely say that he made them on behalf of Section E. He

thought that the Corresponding Societies should be placed permanently
on the list so long as they conformed to the rules of the Association, and

not be elected for a year only as at present. Secondly, the Delegate

should be held responsible for the carrying out of anything required by

the Association, and should be the correspondent with the Secretary of
the Corresponding Societies Committee. It should also be his duty to
report to the Society he represeated on the subjects in which the British

Association desired the co-operation of the Corresponding Societies.
Before the end of the year he should forward to the Corresponding

Societies Committee a copy of his report. And he should forward to the

Secretary of the Corresponding Societies Committee before March in each
year the name of any subject that his Society might wish should be con-

sidered by the Corresponding Societies Committee. He also proposed

that a Delegate about to resign his post might introduce a new Delegate
on sending his name to the Secretary of the Corresponding Societies
Committee, the new Delegate not having the power of votiiig, and not
becoming a member of the General Committee. Other questions also

needed consideration. How long, for example, should a Corresponding

Society remain on the list which did nothing asked for by the British

Association 1 He thought that any Society which did not send a Delegate
year after year should cease to be connected with the Association. And

 he would strongly urge also the enforcement of the Delegate's duty of

.reporting to his own Society and sending a copy of the report to the

 Secretary of the Corresponding Societies Committee.
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  587

     The Chairman remarked that he was afraid they would be told that
by regulations of this kind they were interfering with the internal
management of the Societies.

     Mr. Sowerbutts said that had always been a difficulty, but if the
difficulty were not overcome the work of the Corresponding Societies

Committee could hardly be carried to a profitable issue.

                                              Section H.

     Mr. E. Sidney Hartland, representing Section H, brought before the
notice of the Conference the work of the Anthropological Photographs
Committee, whose object was to collect photographs of objects of anthro-

pological interest. At present the collection was to be placed in the

rooms of the Anthropological Institute. The Committee thought that
there must be in all parts of the country a considerable number of photo-
graphs of this kind of interest to students, but not at present available.
They wanted photographs of prehistoric stone monuments, stone im-
plements, primitive pottery, and of objects connected with local supersti-
tions, &c. Objects of this kind were frequently to be met with in local
museums. Sometimes they belonged to the locality, sometimes not. But
at present their existence there was known only to the local men, and the
Committee wished to make them available for all students of anthropology.
The Secretary of the Committee was Mr. J. L. Myres.

     The Rev. J. O. Bevan said that though the hour was late he wished
to bring forward a proposition. It was ' that the Committees of the
Corresponding Societies be invited to lay before their members the

necessity of carrying on a systematic survey of their counties in respect
to ethnography and ethnology, botany, meteorology, ornithology,
archaeology, folklore, &c.' This kind of work was being done in part at

various places, but at present little was known of it by any central body,
and thence probably there was some confusion and overlapping. The

Society of Antiquaries were prepared to assist any local Society willing to
take up the archseological survey of a county. The Committee of the
British Association which was concerned with the ethnography and

ethnology of the country was dissolved at the Dover meeting. He hoped

that the Committees of the various local Societies would appoint members
according to their several aptitudes to take up specific work, and that the
Corresponding Societies Committee should be in a position to know what
was being done, so as to regulate and co-ordinate the work and give it

direction. He wished that some record might be kept of the resolution by

placing it on the minutes.
     The Chairman said that the only difficulty of putting the resolution

was that the meeting was then so small that it would be hardly fair to

take a vote. He suggested that the resolution should be referred to the

Committee to deal with.
     It was resolved that all the matters touched upon by Mr. Sowerbutts

and Mr. Bevan should be referred to the Committee.

     Mr, Hembry suggested that at future meetings matters connected with

the different Sections should be taken before the reading of a paper on any

special subject.

     The Chairman said that this question might also be referred to the

·Committee.

            The President delivered the following Address:
       It is fitting that before entering upon the business of the Section we should pause
        to take note of the losses which our department of science has recently sustained.
       The fame of Bertrand, apart from his official position as Secretary of the French
       Academy of Sciences, was long ago universally established by his classical treatise
        on the Infinitesimal Calculus : it has been of late years sustained by the luminous
        exposition and searching criticism of his books on the Theory of Probability and
       Thermodynamics and Electricity. The debt which we owe to that other veteran,
       G. "Wiedemann, both on account of his own researches, which take us back to the
        modern revival of experimental physics, and for his great and indispensable

       thesaurus of the science of electricity, cannot easily be overstated. By the death

        of Sophus Lie, following soon after his return to a chair in his native,

       country Norway, we have lost one of the great constructive mathematicians of the
       century, who has in various directions fundamentally expanded the methods and

        conceptions of analysis by reverting to the fountain of direct geometrical intuition.
        In Italy the death of Beltrami has removed an investigator whose influence has
        been equally marked on the theories of transcendental geometry and on the pro-

       gress of mathematical physics. In our own country we have lost in D. E. Hughes
       one of the great scientific inventors of the age ; while we specially deplore the
       removal, in his early prime, of one who has recently been well known at these
        meetings, Thomas Preston, whose experimental investigations on the relations

        between magnetism and light, combined with his great powers of lucid exposition,
        marked out for him a brilliant future.

              Perhaps the most important event of general scientific interest during the past
          year has been the definite undertaking of the great task of the international

       coordination of scientific literature; and it maybe in some measure in the pro-

        longed conferences that were necessitated by that object that the recently
         announced international federation of scientific academies has had its origin. lu
         the important task of rendering accessible the stores of scientific knowledge, the
         British Association, and in particular this Section of it, has played the part of
        pioneer. Our annual volumes have long been classical, through the splendid
         reports of the progress of the difierent branches of knowledge that have been from

        time to time contributed to them by the foremost British men of science ; and our
         work in this direction has received the compliment of successful imitation by the

          sister Associations on the Continent.

teen this year notably augmented by tlie very successful international congresses
of mathematicians and of physicists which met a few weeks ago in Paris. The three

volumes of reports on the progress of physical science during the last ten years, for

which we are indebted to the initiative of the French Physical Society, will pro-

vide an admirable conspectus of the present trend of activity, and forma permanent

record for the history of our subject.

    Another very powerful auxiliary to progress is now being rapidly provided by the

republication, in suitable form and within reasonable time, of the collected works

of the masters of our science. AVe have quite recently received, in a large quarto

volume, the mass of most important unpublished work that was left behind him by

the lato Professor J. C.  Adams                                  the zealous care  of Professor Sampson has worked
                                                              ;

up into order the more purely astronomical part of the volume ; while the great

undertaking, spread over many years, of the complete determination of the secular

change of the magnetic condition of the earth, for which the practical preparations

had been set on foot by Gauss himself, has been prepared for the press by Professor

Vv^ G. Adams. By the publication of the first volume of Lord Rayleigh's papers

a series of memoirs which have formed a main stimulus to the progress of
mathematical physics in this country during the past twenty years has become

generally accessible. The completed series will form a landmark for the end of the
century that may be compared with Young's ' Lectures on Natural Philosophy '

for its beginning.

The recent reconstruction of the University of London, and the foundation

of the University of Birmingham, will, it is to be hoped, give greater free-

dom to the work of our University Colleges. The system of examinations

has formed an admirable stimulus to the eflective acquisition of that general

knowledge which is a necessary part of all education. So long as the examiner

recognises that his function is a responsible and influential one, which is to

be taken seriously from the point of view of moulding the teaching in places

where external guidance is helpful, test by examination will remain a most valu-

able means of extending the area of higher education. Except for workers in

rapidly progressive branches of technical science, a broad education seems better

adapted to the purposes of lite than special training over a narrow range ; and it is

difficult to see how a reasonably elastic examination test can be considered as a
hardship. But the case is changed when preparation for a specialised scientific

profession, or mastery of the lines of attack in an unsolved problem, is the object.

The general education has then been presumably finished ; in expanding depart-

ments of knowledge, variety rather than uniformity of training should be the aim,

and the genius of a great teacher should be allowed free play without external

trammels. It would appear that in this country we have recently been liable to

Weunduly mix up two methods.                                     have been starting students on the special and

lengthy, though very instructive, processes which are known as original research at

an age when their time would be more profitably employed in rapidly acquiring a

broad basis of knowledge. As a result, we have been extending the examination

test from the general knowledge to which it is admirably suited into the specialised

activity which is best left to the stimulus of personal interest. Informal contact

with competent advisers, themselves imbued with the scientific spirit, who can

point the way towards direct appreciation of the works of the masters of the science,

is far more effective than detailed instruction at second hand, as regards growing
subjects that have not yet taken on an authoritative form of exposition. Fortu-

nately there seems to be now no lack of such teachers to meet the requirements of

the technical colleges that are being established throughout the country.

     The famous treatise which opened the modern era by treating magnetism and
electricity on a scientific basis appeared just 300 years ago. The author,
William' Gilbert, M.D., of Colchester, passed from the Grammar School of his

native town to St. John's College, Cambridge : soon after taking his first degree,

in 1560, he became a Fellow of the College, and seems to have remained in resi-

AHdence, and taken part in its affairs, for about ten years.                       through his subse-

quent career, both at Colchester and afterwards at London, where he attained

the highest position in his profession, he was an exact and diligent explorer,

first of chemical and then of magnetic and electric phenomena. In the words of
the historian Hallam, writing in 1839, ' in his Latin treatise on the Magnet he
not only collected all the knowledge which others had possessed, but he became
at once the father of experimental philosophy in this island ; ' and no demur

would be raised if Hallam's restriction to this country were removed. Worlsiog

nearly a century bi-l'ore the time when the astronomical discoveries of Newton had

originated the idea of attraction at a distance, he established a complete formu-

lation of the interaction of magnets by what we now call the exploration of their

fields of force. His analysis of the facts of magnetic influence, and incidentally of

the points in which it diflers from electric influence, is virtually the one which

AFaraday re-introduced.  cardinal advance was achieved, at a time when the

Copernican Astronomy had still largely to make its way, by assigning the

behaviour of the compass and the dip needle to the fact that the earth itself is a

great magnet, by whose field of influence they are controlled. His book passed

through many editions on the Continent within forty years : it won the high

praise of Galileo. Gilbert has been called ' the father of modern electricity by

Priestley, and ' the Galileo of magnetism ' by Poggendortf.

    When the British Association last met at Bradford in 1873 the modern theory

which largely reverts to Gilbert's way of formulation, and refers electric and

magnetic phenomena to the activity of the aether instead of attractions at a

distance, was of recent growth: it had received its classical exposition only two

years before by the publication of Clerk Maxwell's treatise. The new doctrine
was already widely received in England on its own independent merits. On the

Continent it was engaging the strenuous attention of Helmholtz, whose series of

memoirs, deeply probing the new ideas in their relation to the prevalent and

fairly successlul theories of direct action across space, had begun to appear in

1870. Daring many years the search for crucial experiments that would go

beyond the results equally explained  by  both  views  met  with  small  success                               it
                                                                                                            ;

was not until 1887 that Hertz, by the discovery of the aethereal radiation of long

wave-length emitted from electric oscillators, verified the hypothesis of Faraday

and Maxwell and initiated a new era in the practical development of phy>ical

science. The experimental field thus opened up was soon fully occupied both in
this country and abroad ; and the borderland between the sciences of optics and
electricity is now being rapidly explored. The extension of experimental know-

ledge was simultaneous with increased attention to directness of explanation ; the
expositions of Heaviside and Hertz and other writers fixed attention, in a manner

already briefly exemplifled by Maxwell himself, on the inherent simplicity of the

completed aet'hereal scheme, when once the theoretical scaftbldiug employed in its

construction and dynamical consolidation is removed ; while Poyncing's beautiful
corollary specifying the path of the transmission of energy through the sether

has brought the theory into simple relations with the applications of electro-

dynamics.

Equally striking has been the great mastery obtained during the last twenty

years over the practical manipulation of electric power. The installation of

electric wires as the nerves connecting difl'erent regions of the earth had attained

the rank of accomplished fact so long ago as 1857, when the first Atlantic cable
was laid. It was largely the theoretical and practical difficulties, many of them

unforeseen, encountered in carrying that great undertaking to a successful issue,

that necessitated the elaboration by Lord Kelvin and his coadjutors of convenient

methods and instruments for the exact measurement of electric quantities, and

thus prepared the foundation for the more recent practical developments in

other directions. On the other hand, the methods of theoretical explanation have

been in turn improved and simplified through the new ways of considering the

phenomena which have been evolved in the course of practical advances on a

large scale, such as the improvement of dynamo armatures, the conception and

utilisation of magnetic circuits, and the transmission of power by alternating

currents. In our time the relations of civilised life have been already perhaps
more profoundly altered than ever before, owing to the establishment of practically

instantaneous electric communication between all parts of the world. The

employment of the same subtle agency is now rapidly superseding the artificial

reciprocating engines and other contrivances for the manipulation of mechanical

power that were introduced with the employment of steam. The possibilities

of transmitting power to great distances at enormous tension, and therefore with

very slight waste, along lines merely suspended in the air, are being practically

realised ; and the advantages thence derived are increased manifold by the almost
automatic manner in which the electric power can be transformed into mechanical

rotation at the very point where it is desired to apply it. The energy is transmitted

at such lightning speed that at a given instant only an exceedingly minute portion

of it is in actual transit. When the tension of the alternations is high, the amount

of electricity that has to oscillate backwards and forwards on the guiding wires

is proportionately diminished, and the t'rictional waste reduced. At the terminals

the direct transmission from one armature of the motor to the other, across the

intervening empty space, at once takes us beyond the province of the pushing and

rubbing contacts that are unavoidable in mechanical transmission ; while the
perfect symmetry and reversibility of the arrangement by which power is delivered

from a rotatory alternator at one end, guided by the wires to another place many

miles away, where it is absorbed by another alternator with precise reversal of the

initial stages, makes this process of distribution of energy resemble the automatic

operations of nature rather than the imperfect material connections previously in

Wetise.  are here dealing primarily with the flawless continuous medium which

is the transmitter of radiant energy across the celestial spaces ; the part played

by the coarsely constituted material conductor is only that of a more or less

imperfect guide which directs the current of sethereal energy. The wonderful

nature of this theoretically perfect, though of course practically only api)roximate,

method of abolishing limitations of locality with regard to mechanical power is

not diminished by the circumstance that its principle must have been in some

manner present to the mind of the first person who fully reahsed the character of
the reversibility of a Gramme armature.

In theoretical knowledge a new domain, to which the theory as expounded

twenty years ago had little to say, has recently been acquired through the experi-

mental scrutiny of the electric discharge in rarefied gaseous media. The very

varied electric phenomena of vacuum tubes, whose electrolytic character was first

practically established by Schuster, have been largely reduced to order through

the employment of the high exhausnons introduced and first utilised by Crookes.

Their study under these circumstances, in which the material molecules are so

sparsely distributed as but rarely to interfere with each other, has conduced to

enlarged knowledge and verification of the fundamental relations in which the

individual molecules stand to all electric phenomena, culminating recently in the

actual determination, by J. J. Thomson and others following in his track, of the

masses and velocities of the particles that carry the electric discharge across the

exhausted space. The recent investigations of the circumstances of the electric

dissociation produced in the atmosphere and in other gases by ultra-violet light,

the Rontgen radiation, and other agencies, constitute one of the most striking

developments in experimental molecular physics since Graham determined the

molecular relations of gaseous diffusion and transpiration more than half a century

ago. This advance in experimental knowledge ot molecular phenomena, assisted

by the discovery of the precise and rational effect of magnetism on the spectrum,

has brought into prominence a modification or rather development ot Maxwell's

exposition of electric theorv, which was dictated primarily by the requirements of

the abstract theory itself; the atoms or ions are now definitely introduced as

the carriers of those electric charges which interact across the aether, and so pro-

duce the electric fields whose transformations were the main subject of the original

theory.

    We are thus inevitably led, in electric and sethereal theory, as in the chemistry

and dynamics of the gaseous state which is the department of abstract physics

next in order of simplicity, to the consideration of the individual molecules of

matter. The theoretical problems which had come clearly into view a quarter of

a century ago, under Maxwell's lead, whether in thp exact dynamical relations

of sethereal transmission or in the more fortuitous domain of the statistics of

interacting molecules, are those around which attention is still mainly concentrated

--but as the result of the progress in each, they are now tending towards consolida-

tion into one subject. I propose leaving further review of the scientific aspect of

the recent enormous development of the applications of physical science for hands

--more competent to deal with the practical side of that subject to ofier some re-

marks on the scope and validity of this molecular order of ideas, to which the

trend of physical explanation and development is now setting in so pronounced a

manner.

     If it is necessary to offer an apology for detaining the attention of the Section
on so abstract a topic, I can plead its intrinsic philosophical importance. The

hesitation so long felt on the Continent in regard to discarding the highly de-

veloped theories which analysed all physical actions into direct attractions between

the separate elements of the bodies concerned, in favour of a new method in which
our ideas are carried into regions deeper than the phenomena, has now given
place to eager discussion of the potentialities of the new standpoint. There has

even appeared a disposition to consider that the Newtonian dynamical principles,

which have formed the basis of physical explanation for nearly two centuries,

must be replaced in these deeper subjects by a method of direct description of the

mere course of phenomena, apart from any attempt to establish causal relations

the initiation of this method being traced, like that of the Newtonian dynamics

itself, to this country. The question has arisen as to how far the new methods
of sethereal physics are to be considered as an independent departure, how far

they form the natural development of existing dynamical science. In England,

whence the innovation came, it is the more conservative position that has all along

been occupied. Maxwell was himself trained in the school of physics established

in this country by Sir George Stokes and Lord Kelvin, in which the dominating

idea has been that of the strictly dynamical foundation of all physical action.

Although the pupil's imagination bridged over dynamical chasms, across which

the master was not always able to follow, yet the most striking feature of Max-

well's scheme was still the dynamical framework into which it was built. The

more advanced reformers have now thrown overboard the apparatus of poten-

tial functions which Maxwell found necessary for the dynamical consolidation or

his theory, retaining only the final result as a verified descriptive basis for the

phenomena. In this way all difficulties relating to dynamical development and

indeed consistency are avoided, but the question remains as to how much is

thereby lost. In practical electro-magnetics the transmission of power is now the

most prominent                                                                           phenomenon                                                               if formal  dynamics  is  put  aside in  the  general
                                                                                                                                                               ;

theory, its guidance must here be replaced by some more empirical and tenta-

tive method of describing the course of the transmission and transformation of

mechanical energy in the system.

The direct recognition in some form, either explicitly or tacitly, of the part

played by the aether has become indispensable to the development and exposition

of general physics ever since the discoveries of Hertz left no further room for doubt

that this physical scheme of Maxwell was not merely a brilliant speculation, but

constituted, in spite of outstanding gaps and difficulties, a real formulation of the

underlying unity in physical dynamics. The domain of abstract physics is in fact

roughly divisible into two regions. In one of them we are mainly concerned with

interactions between one portion of matter and another portion occupying a dif-

ferent position in space ; such interactions have very uniform and comparatively

simple relations                                                                         and the reason is traceable to the                                                  simple and uniform constitution
                                                                                      ;

of the intervening medium in which they have their seat. The other province is

that in which the distribution of the material molecules comes into account. Set-

ting aside the ordinary dynamics of matter in bulk, which is founded on the

uniformity of the properties of the bodies concerned and their experimental deter-

mination, we must assign to this region all phenomena which are concerned with

the uncoordinated iiotions of the molecules, including the range of thermal and in

part of radiant actions ; the only possible basis for detailed theory is the statistical

dynamics of the distribution of the molecules. The far more deep-seated and

mysterious processes which are involved in changes in the constitution of the indi-

vidual molecules themselves are mainly outside the province of pliysics, whiL-h is

competent to reason only about permanent material systems; they must be left to

the sciences of chemistry and physiology. Yet the chemist proclaims that he can

determine only the results of his reactions and the physical conditions under

which they occur                                                                      the character of the bonds which                                         hold atoms in       their chemical
                                                                                   ;

combinations is at present unknown, although a large domain of very precise

knowledge relating, in some diagrammatic manner, to the topography of the

more complex molecules has been attained. The vast structure which chemical

science has in this way raised on the narrow foundation of the atomic theory is

perhaps the most wonderlul existing illustration both of the rationality of natural

processes and of the aualytical powers of the human mind. In a word, the com-

plication of the material world is referable to the vast r.mge of structure and of

states of aggregation in the material atoms ; while the possibility of a science of

physics is largely due to the simplicity of constitution of the universal medium

through which the individual atoms interact on each other.

The reference of the uniformity in the interactions at a distance between

material bodies to the part played by the agther is a step towards the elimination

of extraneous and random hypotheses about laws of attraction between atoms. It

also places that medium on a different basis from matter, in that its mode of

activity is simple and regular, whereas intimate material interactions must be of

illimitable complexity. This gives strong ground for the view that we should not

be tempted towards explaining the simple grcup of relations which have been found

to define the activity of the rether, by treating them as mechanical consequences of

concealed structure                                                                   in  that medium                                                      we  should rather rest  satisfied  with  having
                                                                                                                                                        ;

attained to their exact dynamical correlation, just as geometry explores or corre-

lates, without explaining, the descriptive and metric properties of space. On the

other hand, a view is upheld which considers the pressures and thrusts of the engineer,

and the strains and stresses in the material structures by which he transmits them

from one place to another, to be the archetype of the processes by which all mecha-

nical eftect is transmitted in nature. This doctrine implies an expectation that we
may ultimatelj' discover something analogous to structure in the celestial spaces,

by means of which the transmission of physical effect will be brought into line

with the transmission of mechanical eftect by material iramework.

At a time when the only definitely ascertained function of the aether was the

undulatory propagation of radiant energy across space, Lord Kelvin pointed out

that, by reason of the very great velocity of propagation, the density of the radiant

energy in the medium at any place must be extremely small in comparison with the

amount of energy that is transmitted in a second of time : this easily led him to the

very striking conclusion that, on the hypothesis that the aether is like material

elastic media, it is not necessary to assume its density to be more than 10"i^

of that of water, or its optical rigidity to be more than ten 10'^ of that of steel

or glass. Thus far the aether would be merely an impalpable material atmosphere

for the transference ot energy by radiation, at extremely small densities but with very

great speed, while ordinary matter would be the seat of practically all this energy.

But this way of explaining the absence of sensible influence of the aether on the

phenomena of material dynamics lost much of its basis as soon as it was recognised

that the same medium must be the receptacle of very high densities of energy in

the electric fields around currents and magnets.' The other mode of explanation

   We^ can here only allude to Lord Kelvin's recent most interesting mechanical

illustrations of a solid a3ther interacting with material molecules and with itself by
attraction at a distance : unlike the generalised dynamical methods expounded in
the text, which can leave the intimate structure of the material molecule outside the
problem, a definite working constitution is there assigned to the molecular nucleus.
It is pointed out in a continuation that is to appear in the Phil. Mafj. for September,
that a density of sether of the order of only 10"^", which would not appreciably affect
the inertia of matter, would involve rigidity comparable with that of steel, and
thus permit transmission of magnetic forces by stress ; this solid rether is however,
as usual, taken to be freely permeable to the molecules of matter.
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.    G19

is to consider the .letber to be of the very essence of all physical actions, and to
correlate the absence of obvious mechanical evidence of its intervention with its

regularity and universality.

    On this plan of making the sether the essential factor in the transformation of

energy as well as its transmission across space, the material atom must be some

kind of permanent nucleus that retains around itself an sethereal held of physical

Weinfluence, such as, for example, a field of strain.  can recognise the atom only

through its interactions with other atoms that are so far away from it as to be

practically independent systems ; thus our direct knowledge of the atom will be

confined to this field of force which belongs to it. Just as the exploration of the

distant field of magnetic influence of a steel magnet, itself concealed from view,

cannot tell us anything about the magnet except the amount and direction of its

moment, so a practically complete knowledge of the field of physical influence of

an atom might be expressible in terms of the numerical values of a limited number

of physical moments associated with it, without any revelation as to its essential

structure or constitution being involved. This will at any rate be the case for

ultimate atoms if, as is most likely, the distances at which they are kept apart are

lai'ge compared with tho diameters of the atomic nuclei ; it in fact forms our only

chance for penetrating to definite dynamical views of molecular structure. So

long as we cannot isolate a single molecule, but must deal observationally with an

innumerable distribution of them, even this kind of knowledge will be largely con-

fined to average values. But the last half-century has witnessed the successful

application of a new instrument of research, which has removed in various direc-

tions the limitations that had previously been placed on the knowledge to which

it was possible for human eflbrt to look forward. The spectroscope has created a

new astronomy by revealing the constitutions and the unseen internal motions of

the stars. Its power lies in the fact that it does take hold of the internal relations

of the individual molecule of matter, and provide a very definite and detailed,

though far from complete, analysis of the vibratory motions that are going on in it

these vibrations being in their normal state characteristic of its dynamical consti-

tution, and in their deviations from the normal giving indications of the velocity

of its movement and the physical state of its environment. Maxwell long ago laid

emphasis on the fact that a physical atomic theory is not competent even to con-

template the vast mass of potentialities and correlations of the past and the future,

that biological theory has to consider as latent in a single organic germ containing

at most only a few million molecules. On our present view we can accept his

position that the properties of such a body cannot he those of a ' purely material

system,' provided, however, we restrict this phrase to apply to physical properties

as here defined. But an exhaustive discovery of the intimate nature of the atom

is beyond the scope of physics questions as to whether it must not necessarily

involve in itself some image of the complexity of the organic structures of which

it can form a correlated part must remain a subject of speculation outside the

domain of that science. It might be held that this conception of discrete atoms

and continuous sether really stands, like those of space and time, in intimate

relation with our modes of mental apprehension, into which any consistent picture

of the external world must of necessity be fitted. In any case it would involve

abandonment of all the successful traditions of our subject if we ceased to hold

that our analysis can be formulatir-d in a consistent and complete manner, so far as

it goes, without being necessarily an exhaustive account of phenomena that are

beyond our range of experiment. Such phenomena may be more closely defined

as those connected with the processes of intimate combination of the molecules:

they include the activities of organic beings which all seem to depend on change

of molecular structure.

    If, then, we have so small a hold on the intimate nature of matter, it will appear
all the more striking that physicists have been able precisely to divine the mode of

operation of the intangible sether, and to some extent explore in it the fields of

physical influence of the molecules. On consideration we recognise that this

knowledge of fundamental physical interaction has been reached by a comparative

process. The mechanism of the propagation of light could never have been studied

in tlie free tetlier of space alone. It was possible, however, to determine the way in

which the characteristics of optical propagation are modified, but not wholly

transformed, when it takes place in a transparent material body instead of empty

space. The change in fact arises on account of the sether being entangled with

the network of ma^erial molecules ; but inasmuch as the length of a single wave of

radiation covers thousands of these molecules the wave-motion still remains uni-

Aform and does not lose its general type.  wider variation of the experimental

conditions has been provided for our examination in the case of those substances

in which the phenomenon of double refraction pointed to a change of the sethereal

properties which varied in  different directions                                                                        and minute study of this modifica-
                                                                                                                     ;

tion has proved sufficient to guide to a consistent appreciation of the nature of

this change, and therefore of the mode of sethereai propagation that is thus altered.

In the same way, it was the study and development of the manner in which the

laws of electric phenomena in material bodies had been unravelled by Ampere

--and Faraday, that guided Faraday himself and Maxwell who were impressed
--with the view that the asther was at the bottom of it all in their progress towards

an application of similar laws to aether devoid of matter, such as would complete a

scheme of continuous action by consistently interconnecting the material bodies

and banishing all untraced interaction across empty space. Maxwell in fact chose

to finally expound the theory by ascribing to the iether of free space a dielectric

constant and a magnetic constant of the same types as had been found to express

the properties of material media, thus extending the seat of the phenomena to all

space on the plan of describing the activity of the asther in terms of the ordinary

electric ideas. The converse mode of development, starting with the free aether

under the directly dynamical form which has been usual in physical optics, and

introducing the influence of the material atoms through the electric charges which

are involved in their constitution,^ was hardly employed by him ; in part, perhaps,
because, owing to the necessity of correlating his theory with existing electric

knowledge and the mode of its expression, he seems never to have reached the

stage of moulding it into a completely deductive form.

The dynamics of the sether, in fact the recognition of the existence of an aether,

has thus, as a matter of histor}^, been reached through study of the dynamical

phenomena of matter. When the dynamics of a material system is worked up to

its purest and most general form, it becomes a formulation of the relations between

the succession of the configurations and states of motion of the svstem, the assist-

Weance of an independent idea offeree not being usually required.                                                       can, however,

only attain to such a compact statement when the system is self-contained, when

its motion is not being dissipated by agencies of friciional type, and when its con-

nections can be directly specified by purely geometrical relations between the

coordinates, thus excluding such mechanisms as rolling contacts. The courseof the

system is then in all cases determined by some form or other of a single fundamental

property, that any alteration in any small portion of its actual course must produce

an increase in the total ' Action ' of the motion. It is to be observed that in

employing this law of minimum as regards the Action expressed as an integral

over the whole time of the motion, we no more introduce the future course as a

determining influence on the present state of motion than we do in drawing a

straight line from any point in any direction, although the length of the line is the

minimum distance between its ends. In drawing the line piece by piece we have to
make tentntive excursions into the immediate future in order to adjust each element

into straightness with the previous element ; so in tracing the next stage of the

motion of a material system we have similarly to secure that it is not given any

such directions as would unduly increase the Action. But whatever views may

be held as to the ultimate significance of this principle of Action, its importance,

     ' In 1870 Maxwell, while admiring the breadth of the theory of Weber, which is

virtually based on atomic charges combined with action at a distance, still regarded

it as irreconcilable with his own theory, and left to the future the question as to

--why ' theories apparently so fundamentally opposed should have so large a field o|

truth common to both.' 'Scientific Papers,' ii. p. ?28.

not only for mathematical analysis, but as. a guide to physical exploration, remains

fundamental. When the principles of the dynamics of material systems are refined
down to their ultimate common basis, this principle of minimum is what remains.

Hertz preferred to express its contents in the form of a principle of straifrhtness of

course or path. It will be recognised, on the lines already indicated, that this is

another mode of statement of the same fundamental idea : and the general equiva-

lence is worked out by Hertz on the basis of Hamilton's development of the prin-

ciples of dynamics. The latter mode of statement may be adaptable so as to avoid

the limitations which restrict the connections of the system, at the expense, however,

of introducing new variables ; if, indeed, it does not introduce gratuitous complexity
for purposes of physics to attempt to do this. However these questions may stand,

this principle of straightness or directness of path forms, wherever it applies, the

most general and comprehensive formulation of purely dynamical action : it involves

in itself the complete course of events. In so far as we are given the algebraic

formula for the time-integral which constitutes the Action, expressed in terms of

any suitable coordinates, we know implicitly the whole dynamical constitution and

history of the system to which it applies. Two systems in which the Action is

expressed by the same formula are mathematically identical, are physically pre-

cisely correlated, so that they have all dynamical properties in common. When

the structure of a dynamical system is largely concealed from view, the safest and

most direct way towards an exploration of its essential relations and connections,

and in fact towards answering the prior question as to whether it is a purely

dynamical system at all, is through this order of ideas. The ultimate test that a

system is a dynamical one is not that we shall be able to trace mechanical stresses

throughout it, but that its relations can be in some way or other consolidated into

accordance with this principle of minimum Action. This definition of a dynamical

system in terms of the simple principle of directness of path may conceivably be

subject to objection as too wide; it is certainly not too narrow; and it is the

conception which has naturally been evolved from two centuries of study of the

dynamics of material bodies. Its very great generality may lead to the objection

that we might completely formulate the future course of a system in its terms, with-

out having obtained a working familiarity with its details, of the kind to which we

have become accustomed in the analysis of simple material systems ; but our choice

18 at present between this kind of formulation, which is a real and essential one,

and an empirical description of the course of phenomena combined with expla-

nations relating to more or less isolated groups. The list of great names, including

Kelvin, Maxwell, Helmholtz, that have been associated with the employment of

the principle for the elucidation of the relations of deep-seated dynamical pheno-

mena, is a strong guarantee that we shall do well by making the most of this clue.

Are we then justified in treating the material molecule, so far as revealed by

the spectroscope, as a dynamical system coming under this specification ? Its

intrinsic energy is certainly permanent and not subject to dissipation ; otherwise

the molecule would gradually fade out of existence. The extreme precision and

regularity of detail iu the spectrum shows that the vibrations which produce it

are exactly synchronous, whatever be their amplitude, and in so far resemble the

vibrations of small amplitude in material systems. As all indications point to

the molecule being a system in a state of intrinsic motion, like a vortex ring, or a

stellar system in astronomy, we must consider these radiating vibrations to take

place around a steady state of motion which does not itself radiate, not around a

Nowstate of rest.  not the least of the advantages possessed by the Action prin-

ciple, as a foundation for theoretical physics, is the fact that its statement can be

adapted to systems involving in their constitution permanent steady motions of

this kind, in such a way that only the variable motions superposed on them come

into consideration. The possibilities as regards physical correlation of thus intro-

ducing permanent motional states as well as permanent structure into the con-

stitution of our dynamical systems have long been emphasised by Lord Kelvin ; ^

pendently by Kelvin and Routh about 1877 ; the more recent exposition of the

theory by Ilelmholtz has directed general attention to "what is undoubtedly the

most significant extension of dynamical analysis which has taken place since the

time of Lagrange.

fether into the system has not a&ected its application. It is therefore a reasonable

hypothesis that the principle forms an allowable foundation for the dynamical

analysis of the radiant vibrations in the system formed by a single molecule and

surrounding sether ; and the knowledge which is now accumulating, both of the

orderly grouping of the lines of the spectrum and of the modifications impressed

on these lines by a magnetic field or by the density of the matter immediately

surrounding the vibrating molecule, can hardly fail to be fruitful for the dynamical

analysis of its constitution. But let it be repeated that this analysis would be

complete when a formula for the dynamical energy of the molecule is obtained, and

would go no deeper. Starting from our definitely limited definition of the nature

of a dynamical system, the problem is merely to correlate the observed relations of

the periods of vibration in a molecule, when it has come into a steady state

as regards constitution and is not under the influence of intimate encounter with

other molecules.

    It may be recalled incidentally that the generalised Maxwell-Boltzmann

principle of the equable distribution of the acquired store of kinetic energy of the

molecule, among its various possible independent types of motion, is based directly

on the validity of the Action principle for its dynamics. In the demonstrations

usually offered the molecule is considered to have no permanent or constitutive

energy of internal motion. It can, however, be shown, by use of the generalisa-

tion aforesaid of the Action principle, that no discrepancy will arise on that

account. Such intrinsic kinetic energy virtually adds on to the potential energy of

the system ; and the remaining or acquired part of the kinetic energy of the

molecule may be made the subject of the same train of reasoning as before.
    Let us now return to the general question whether our definition of a dyna-

mical system may not be too wide. As a case in point, the single principle of

Action has been shown to provide a definite and sufficient basis for electro-

dynamics yet when, for example, one armature of an electric motor pulls the
                                                     ;

other after it without material contact, and so transmits mechanical power,

no connection between them is indicated by the principle such as could by virtue

of internal stress transmit the pull. The essential feature of the transmission of
a pull by stress across a medium is that each element of volume of the medium
acts by itself, independently of the other elements. The stress excited in any

element depends on the strain or other displacement occurring in that element

alone ; and the mechanical efi'ect that is transmitted is considered as an extraneous

force applied at one place in the medium, and passed on from element to element

Wethrough these internal pressures and tractions until it reaches another place.

have, however, to consider two atomic electric charges as being themselves some

kind of strain configurations in the tether ; each of them already involves an
atmosphere of strain in the surrounding sether which is part of its essence, and

cannot be considered apart from it ; each of them essentially pervades the entire

space, though on account of its invariable character we consider it as a unit.

Thus we appear to be debarred from imagining the sether to act as an elastic

connection which is merely the agent of transmission of a pull from the one

nucleus to the other, because there are already stresses belonging to and consti-

tuting an intrinsic part of the terminal electrons, which are distributed all along the

medium. Our Action criterion of a dynamical system, in fact, allows us to reason

about an electron as a single thing, notwithstanding that its field of energy is

spread over the whole medium ; it is only in material solid bodies, and in problems
in which the actual sphere of physical action of the molecule is small compared

with the smallest element of volume that our analysis considers, that the familiar

idea of transmission of force by simple stress can apply. Whatever view may
Transactions of section a.  G23

ultimately commend itself, this question is one that urgently (lem<ands decision.

A very large amount of effort baa been expended by Maxwell, Ilelmholtz,

Heaviside, Hertz, and other authorities in the attempt to express the mechanical
phenomena of electrical action in terms of a transmitting stress. The analytical

results^ up to a certain point have been promising, most strikingly so at the

beginning, when Maxwell established the mathematical validity of the way in
which Faraday was accustomed to represent to himself the mechanical interactions

across space, in terms of a tension along the hues of force equilibrated by an equal

pressure preventing their expansion sideways. According to the views here deve-

loped, that ideal is an impossible one ; if this could be established to general

satisfaction the field of theoretical discussion would be much simplified.
     This view that the atom of matter is, so far as regards physical actions, of

the nature of a structure in the tether involving an atmosphere of sethereal strain

all around it, not a small body which exerts direct actions at a distance on
other atoms according to extraneous laws of force, was practically foreign to the
eighteenth century, when mathematical physics was modelled on the Newtonian
astronomy and dominated by its splendid success. The scheme of material

dynamics, as finally compactly systematised by Lagrange, had therefore no direct

relation to such a view, although it has proved wide enough to include it. The
remark has often been made that it is probably owing to Faraday's mathematical

instinct, combined with his waut of acquaintance with the existing analysis, that the
modern theory of the a3ther obtained a start from the electric side. Through his
teaching and the weight of his authority, the notion of two electric currents

e.xerting their mutual forces by means of an intervening medium, instead of by
direct attraction across space, was at an early period firmly grasped in this

country. In 1845 Lord Kelvin was already mathematically formulating, with
most suggestive success, continuous elastic connections, by whose strain the fields

of activity of electric currents or of electric distributions could be illustrated
while the exposition of Maxwell's interconnected scheme, in the earlier form in
which it relied on concrete models of the electric action, goes back almost to 1860.

Corresponding to the two physical ideals of isolated atoms exerting attraction at
a distance, and atoms operating by atmospheres of sethereal strain, there are, as

already indicated, two ditt'erent developments of dynamical theory. The original
Newtonian equations of motion determined the course of a system by expressing
the rates at which the velocity of each of its small parts or elements is changing.
This method is still fully applicable to those problems of gravitational astronomy
in which dynamical explanation was first successful on a grand scale, the planets

being treated as point-masses, each subject to the gravitational attraction of the

other bodies. But the more recent development of the dynamics of complex
systems depends on the fact that analysis has been able to reduce within manageable
limits the number of varying quantities whose course is to be explicitly traced,

through taking advantage of those internal relations of the parts of the system that
are invariable, either geometrically or dynamically. Thus, to take the simplest

case, the dynamics of a solid body can be confined to a discussion of its three com-
ponents of translation and its three components of rotation, instead of the motion
of each element of its mass. With the number of independent coordinates thus
diminished, when the initial state of the motion is specified the subsequent course of
the complete system can be traced ; but the course of the changes in any part of
it can only be treated in relation to the motion of the system as a whole. It is just
this mode of treatment of a system as a whole that is the main characteristic of
modern physical analysis. The way in which Maxwell analysed the interactions
of a system of linear electric currents, previously treated as if each were made up
of small independent pieces or elements, and accumulated the evidence that they
formed a sing-le dynamical system, is a trenchant example. The interactions of
vortices in fluid form a very similar problem, which is of special note in that the
constitution of the system is there completely known in advance, so that the two
modes of dynamical exposition can be compared. In this case the older method
forms independent equations for the motion of each material element of the fluid,
aud so requires the introduction of the stress--here the fluid pressure--by which

dynamical effect is passed on to it from the surrounding elements : it correspdnds
to a method of contact action. But Helmholtz opened up new pfround in the abstract

dynamics of continuous media when he recognised (after Stokes) that, if the dis-
tribution of the velocity of spin at those places in the fluid where the motion

is vortical be assigned, the motion in every part of the fluid is therein liinemati-
cally involved. This, combined with the theorem of Lagrange and Cauchy, that
the spin is always confined to the same portions of the fluid, formed a starting-

point for his theory of vortices, which showed how the subsequent course of the

motion can be ascertained without consideration of pressure or other stress.
     The recognition of the permanent state of motion constituting a vortex ring as

a determining agent as regards the future course of the system was in fact justly
considered by Helmholtz as one of his greatest achievements. The principle had
entirely eluded the attention of Lagrange and Cauchy and Stokes, who were the
pioneers in this fundamental branch of dynamics, and had virtually prepared all
the necessary analytical material for Helmholtz's use. The main import of this
advance lay, not in the assistance which it aflbrded to the development of the
complete solution of special problems in fluid motion, but in the fact that it con-
stituted the discovery of the types of permanent motion of the system, which could
combine and interact with each other without losing their individuality/ though
each of them pervaded the whole field. This rendered possible an entirely new
mode of treatment ; and mathematicians who were accustomed, as in astronomy,
to aim directly at the determination of all the details of the special case of motion,
were occasionally slow to apprehend the advantages of a procedure which stopped
at formulating a description of the nature of the interaction between various
typical groups of motions into which the whole disturbance could be resolved.

     The new train of ideas introduced into physics by Faraday was thus consolidated
and emphasised by Helmholtz's investigations of 1858 in the special domain of hydro-
dynamics. In illustration let us consider the fluid medium to be pervaded by per-
manent vortices circulating round solid rings as cores : the older method of analysis
would form equations of motion for each element of the fluid, involving the fluid
pressure, and by their integration would determine the distribution of pressure on
each solid ring, and thence the way it moves. This method is hardly feasible even
in the simplest cases. The natural plan is to make use of existing simplifications by

regarding each vortex as a permanent reality, and directly attacking the problem
of its interactions with the other vortices. The energy of the fluid arising from the
vortex motion can be expressed in terms of the positions and strengths of the vor-
tices alone ; and then the principle of Action, in the generalised form which
includes steady motional configurations as well as constant material configura-
tions, affords a method of deducing the motions of the cores and the interactions
between them. If the cores are thin they in fact interact mechanically, as Lord
Kelvin and Kirchhoff" proved, in the same manner as linear electric currents would
do ; though the impulse thence derived towards a direct hydro-kinetic explanation
of electro-magnetics was damped by the fact that repulsion and attraction have to
be interchanged in the analogy. The conception of vortices, once it has been
arrived at, forms the natural physical basis of investigation, although the older
method of determining a diitribution of pressure-stress throughout the fluid and

examining how it aff'ects the cores is still possible ; that stress, however, is not simply

transmitted, as it has to maintain thechangesofvelocityof the various portions of the

fluid. But if the vortices have no solid cores we are at a loss to know where even this
pressure can be considered as applied to them ; if we follow up the stress, we lose
the vortex yet a fluid vortex can nevertheless illustrate an atom of matter, and we

can consider such atoms as exerting mutual forces, only these forces cannot be consi-
dered as transmitted through the agency of fluid pressure. The reason is that the

vortex cannot now be identified with a mere core bounded by a definite surface, but

is essentially a configuration of motion extending throughout the medium.

     Thus we are again in face of the fundamental question whether all attempts to

orbits into physical astronomy.
      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.      625

 represent themecaanical interactions of electro-dynamic systems, as transmitted from
 Soint to point by means of simple stress, are not doomed to failure ; whether they

   o not, in fact, introduce unnecessary and insurmountable difficulty into the theory.
 The idea of identifying an atom with a state of strain or motion, pervading the region
 of the EBther around its nucleus, appears to demand wider views as to what constitutes
 dynamical transmission. The idea that any small portion of the primordial
 medium can be isolated, by merely introducing tractions acting over its surface and
 transmitted from the surrounding parts, is no longer appropriate or consistent : a
 part of the dynamical disturbance in that element of the medium is on this hypo-

--thesis already classified as belonging to, and carried along with, atoms that are

 outside it but in its neighbourhood and this part must not be counted twice over.

 The law of Poynting relating to the paths of the transmission of energy is known to
 hold in its simple form only when the electric charges or currents are in a steady
 state ; when they are changing their positions or configurations their own fields of

 intrinsic energy are carried along with them.
      It is not surprising, considering the previous British familiarity with this

 order of ideas, that the significance for general physics of Helmholtz's doctrine of

 vortices was eagerly developed in this country, in the form in which it became
 embodied through Lord Kelvin's famous illustration of the constitution of
 matter, as consisting of atoms with separate existence and mutual interactions.

 This vortex-atom theory has been a main source of physical suggestion because
 it presents, on a simple basis, a dynamical picture of an ideal material system,
 atomically constituted, which could go on automatically without extraneous sup-

 port. The value of such a picture may be held to lie, not in any supposition that

 this is the mechanism of the actual world laid bare, but in the vivid illustration
 it affords of the fundamental postulate of physical science, that mechanical
 phenomena are not parts of a scheme too involved for us to explore, but rather

present themselves in definite and consistent correlations, which we are able to dis-

entangle and apprehend with continually increasing precision.
      It would be an interesting question to trace the origin of our preference for a

 theory of transmission of physical action over one of direct action at a distance.

It may be held that it rests on the same order of ideas as supplies our conception
of force ; that the notion of effort which we associate with change of the motion

 of a body involves the idea of a mechanical connection through which that effort
is applied. The mere idea of a transmitting medium would then be no more an
ultimate foundation for physical explanation than that of force itself Our choice
between direct distance action and mediate transmission would thus be dictated
by the relative simplicity and coherence of the accounts they give of the
phenomena : this is, in fict, the basis on which Maxwell's theory had to be judtjed
until Hertz detected the actual working of the medium. In-^tantaae.ou^ transnis-

sion is to all intents action at a distance, except in so far as the law of action may
be more easily formulated in terms of the medium than in a direct geometrical

statement.

     In connection with these questions it may be permitted to refer to the eloquent
and weighty address recently delivered by M. Poincare to the International Con-
gress of Physics. M. Poincare accepts the principle of Least Action as a

reliable basis for the formulation of physical theory, but he imposes the condition
that the results must satisfy the Newtonian law of equality of action and
reaction between each pair of bodies concerned, considered by themselves
this, however, he would allow to he satisfied indirectly, if the effects could
be traced across the intervening asther by stress, so that the tractions on the

two sides of each ideal interface are equal and opposite.^ As above argued,

this view appears to exclude ah initio all atomic theories of the general type
of vorte:^ atoms, iu which the energy of the atom is distributed throughout

standpoint of Hertz's posthumous Meohanih approximates, however, to that hero
mamtained.] The problem of merely replacing a system of forces by a statical stress
is widely indeterminate, and therefore by itself unreal; the actual question is
whether any such representation can be coordinated with existing dynamics.

the medium instead of teing concentrated in a nucleus ; and this remark seems to
go to the root of the question. On the other hand, the position here asserted is

that recent dynamical developments have permitted the extension of the principle
of Action to systems involving permanent motions, whether obvious or latent, as

part of their constitution ; that on this wider basis the atom may itself involve a

state of steady disturbance extending through the medium, instead of being only a
local structure acting by push and pull. The possibilities of dynamical explanation
are thus enlarged. The most definite type of model yet imagined of the physical
interaction of atoms through the aether is, perhaps, that which takes the aether to
be a rotationally elastic medium after the manner of MacCullagh and Rankine,
and makes the ultimate atom include the nucleus of a permanent rotational strain-

configuration, which as a whole may be called an electron. The question how far

this is a legitimate and eSective model stands by itself, apart from the dynamics
which it illustrates ; like all representations it can only cover a limited ground.
For instance, it cannot claim to include the internal structure of the nucleus of an
atom or even of an electron ; for purposes of physical theory that problem can be put

aside, it may even be treated as inscrutable. All that is needed is a postulate of

free mobilit}' of this nucleus through the aether. This is definitely hypothetical, but
it is not an unreasonable postulate because a rotational aether has the properties of

a perfect fluid medium except where diSerentially rotational motions are concerned,
and so would not react on the motion of any structure moving through it except
after the manner of an apparent change of inertia. It thus seems possible to hold

that such a model forms an allowable representation of the dynamical activity of
the aether, as distinguished from the complete constitution of the material nuclei
between which that medium establishes connection.

     At any rate, models of this nature have certainly been most helpful in Max-

well's hands towards the eifective intuitive grasp of a scheme of relations as a
whole, which might have proved too complex for abstract unravelment in detail.

When a physical model of concealed dynamical processes has served this kind of

purpose, when its content has been explored and estimated, and has become
familiar through the introduction of new terms and ideas, then the ladder by

which we have ascended may be kicked away, and the scheme of relations which
the model embodied can stand forth in sevei-ely abstract form. Indeed many of
the most fruitful branches of abstract mathematical analysis itself have owed their
start in this way to concrete physical conceptions. This gradual transition into

 abstract statement of physical relations in fact amounts to retaining the essentials

 of our working models while eliminating the accidental elements involved in
 them; elements of the latter kind must always be present because otherwise the

model would be identical with the thing which it represents, whereas we cannot

 expect to mentally grasp all aspects of the content of even the simplest phenomena.
Yet the abstract standpoint is always attained through the concrete; and for
 purposes of instruction such models, properly guarded, do not perhaps ever lose
 their value : they are just as legitimate aids as geometrical diagrams, and they
 have the same kind of limitations. In Maxwell's words, ' for the sake of persons
 of these diiferent types scientific truth should be presented in different forms, and
 should be regarded as equally scientific whether it appear in the robust form and
 the vivid colouring of a physical illustration, or in the tenuity and paleness of a
 symbolical expression.' The other side of the picture, the necessai-y incomplete-
ness of even our legitimate images and modes of i-epresentation, comes out in the

despairing opinion of Young (' Chromatics,' 1S17), at a time when his faith in the
 undulatoi-y theory of light had been eclipsed by Malus's discovery of the pheno-
 mena of polarisation by retlection, that this difficulty ' will probably long remain,
to mortify the vanity of an ambitious philosophy, completely um-esolved by any
theory: ' not many years afterwards the mystery v.^as solved by Fresnel.

      This process of removing the intellectual scafiolding by which our knowledge
is reached, and preserving only the final formulae which express the corfelations
of the directly observable things, may moreover readily be pushed too far. It
asserts the conception that the universe is like an enclosed clock that is wound up
to go, and that accordingly we can observe that it is going, and can see some of
                                                                                                                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                            627

ita more superficial movements, but not much of them ; that thus, hy patient obser-
vation and use of analogy, we can compile, in merely tabular form, information as

to the manner iu which it works and is likely to go on working, at any rate for

some time to come ; but that any attempt to probe the underlying connection is
illusory or illegitimate. As a theoretical pi-ecept this is admirable. It minimises

the danger of our ignoring or forgetting the limitations of human faculty, which

can only utilise the imperfect representations that the external world impresses on

our senses. On the other hand such a reminder has rarely been required by the

master minds of modern science, from Descartes and Newton onwards, whatever

their theories may have been. Its danger as a dogma lies in its application.

Who is to decide, without risk of error, what is essential fact and what is intellec

tual scaffolding ? To which class does the atomic theory of matter belong ? That

is, indeed, one of the intangible things which it is suggested may be thrown over-

board in sorting out and classifying our scientific possessions. Is the mental idea

or image, which suggests, and alone can suggest, the experiment that adds to our

concrete knowledge, less real thin the bare phenomenal uniformity which it has

revealed ? Is it not, perhaps, more real in that the uniformities might not have

been there in the absence of the mind to perceive them ?

No time is now left for review of the methods of molecular dynamics.

Here our knowledge is entirely confined to steady states of the molecular system :

it is purely statical. In ordinary statics and the dynamics of undisturbed

steady notions, the form of the energy function is the sufficient basis of the

whole subject. This method is extended to thermo-dynamics by making use of

the mechanically available eni^rgy of Rankine and Kelvin, which is a function of

the bodily configuration and chemical constitution and temperature of the system,

whose value cannot under any circumstances spontaneously increase, while it

will diminish in any operation which is not reversible. In the statics of systems

in equilibrium or in steady motion, this method of energy is a particular case of

the method of Action ; but in its extension to thermal statics it is made to include

chemical as well as contigurational changes, and a new point appears to arise.

Whether we do or do not take it to be possible to trace the application of the

principle of Action throughout the process of chemical combination of two mole-

cules, we Cfrtainiy here postulate that the static case of that principle, which

applies to stei^dy systems, can be extended across chemical combinations. The

question is suggested whether extension would also be valid to transformations

which involve vital processes. This seems to be still considered an open question

by the best authorities. If it be decided in the negative a distinction is involved

between vital and merely chemical processes.

It is now taken as established that vital activity cannot create energy, at any

rate in the long run which is all that can from the nature of the case "be tested.

It seems not unreasor£.ble to follow the analogy of chemical actions, and assert

--that it cannot in the long run increase the mechanical availability of energy that

is, considering the organism as an apparatus for transforming energy without

being itself in the long run changed. 13ut we cannot establish a Carnot cycle for
a portion of an organism, nor can we do so for a limited period of time ; there
might be creation of availability ace mpanied by changes in the organism itself,

but compensated by destruction and the inverse changes a long time afterwards.

This auiounts to asserting that where, as in a vital system or even in a simple

molecular combination, we are unable to trace or even assert complete dynamical

sequence, exact thermodynamic statements should be mainly confined to the

activity of the existing organism as a whole: it may transform inorganic material

without change of energy and without gain of availability, although any such

statements would be inappropriate and unmeaning as regards the details of the

processes that take place inside the organism itself.

In any case it would appear that there is small chance of reducing these ques-

tions to direct dynamics                                                                                            we should rather  regard  Carnot's principle,  which  in-

the conditions of permanency are unknown except in the simpler cases. The only

mode of discussion that is yet possible is the method of dynamical statistics of mole-

cules introduced by Maxwell. Now statistics is a method of arrangement rather

than of demonstration. Every statistical argument requires to be verified by com-

parison with the I'acts, because it is of the essence of this method to take things as

fortuitously distributed except in so far as we know the contrary ; and we simply

may not know essential facts to the contrary. For example, if the interaction of

the fether or other cause produces no influence to the contrary, the presumption

would be that the kinetic energy acquired by a molecule is, on the average, equally

distributed among its various independent modes of motion, whether vibrational

or translational. Assuming this type of distribution to be once established in a

gaseous system, the dynamics of Boltzmann and Maxwell show that it must be

permanent. But its assumption in the first instance is a result rather of the

absence than of the presence of knowledge of the circumstances, and can be

accepted only so far as it agrees with the facts ; our knowledge of the facts of

specific heat shows that it must be restricted to modes of motion that are homo-

logous. In the words of Maxwell, when he first discovered in 18G0, to his great

surprise, that in a system of colliding rigid atoms the energy would always be

equally divided between translatory and rotatory motions, it is only necessary to

assume, in order to evade this unwelcome conclusion, that · something essential to

the complete statement of the physical theory of molecular encounters must have

hitherto escaped us.'

     Our survey thus tends to the result, thnt as regards the simple and uniform

phenomena which involve activity of finite regions of the universal fother,
theoretical physics can lay claim to constructive functions, and can build up a
definite scheme ; but in the domain of matter the most that it can do is to accept
the existence of such permanent molecular systems as present themselves to our
notice, and tit together an outline plan of the more general and universal features
in their activity. Our well-founded belief in the rationality of natural processes
asserts the possibility of this, while admitting that the intimate details of atomic
constitution are beyond our scrutiny and provide plenty of room for processes that

transcend finite dynamical correlation.

1. Note on M. Cremieu's Experiment. By Prof. G. F. FitzGerald, F.R.S.

    M. Cremieu has shown that, if his experimental methods can bear criticism as
·well as they seem to do, there is no induced electromotive force on a coil of wire
Burroundins a rotating disc when the strength of an electric charge on the disc is

chano-ing. He has deduced from this the conclusion that there is no magnetic

induction through the disc due to the moving charge such as Rowland's experi-

ments showed. This note is to point out that too little is known of the theory of
the ethereal effects of a charge of electricity forced to move by mechanical actions
for us to be quite sure that both M. Cremieu's and Rowland's observations may
not be true-- Je., that it is possible that a charge of electricity, while it is being
accelerated by moving matter, may produce such an action on the surrounding
ether as to neutralise the electric force that would otherwise be produced by the

changing magnetic induction due to the moving charge.

     3. On a Method of Investigating Correspondences between S2^eclra.

                                By Hugh Ramage.

     The method is graphical ; spectral lines are plotted as abscissre, and the atomic
weights of the elements, or functions of the atomic weights, as ordinates. Con-

 necting lines are then drawn tlirougli homologous spectral lines. The spectra
 studied by the author in this way are chiefly those emitted by the metals in the
 oxyhydrogen and oxycoal gas flames. These spectra are much simpler than those
 of the same metals in the electric arc or spark, and may be regarded as the funda-
 mental spectra of the metals. They are therefore the most suitable spectra for

 comparison.

     As the flame spectra of the metals have not been fully investigated some linea
 have been selected, to make the diagrams more complete, from arc and spark
 spectra. In these cases the selection was made after a study of the character ot
 the lines in these spectra. Later experimental work on flame spectra has con-
 firmed the selection of some of these lines, and the work on the Zeeman efl'ect, of

 Preston on magnesium, zinc, and cadmium, and of Lord Blythswood and Dr.
Marchant on mercury, confirms it in the spectrum of the latter metal. The
formulae and work of Eydberg and of Kayser and Kunge lead to the selection of
the same lines in all cases, and with these formulte as guides it is possible to
e.'stend the work to other lines and spectra. This has been done, but only to a

--limited extent at present. The diagrams exhibited were drawn (1) from atomic

weights and oscillation frequencies, and (2) from the squares of the atomic weights
and oscillation frequencies.

     The diagrams show very clearly that the spectra of similar elements are very
closely related to one another. That the spectra of potassium, rubidium, and
Cffisium are more closely related to one another than to those of lithium and sodium,
and that there is also a break between the spectrum of magnesium and those of
zinc, cadmium, and mercury, and between that of aluminium and those of gallium,
indium, and thallium.

     The connecting lines of the difl'use subordinate series of potassium, rubidium,
and caesium approach in the more refrangible lines measured to straight lines,

while those of the principal series are nearly straight lines in the second diagram.

     The lines joining the homologous lines of doublets and triplets approach one
another as the atomic weight decreases, and, in the second diagram, intersect in
points near the line of zero atomic weight. These curves give exact information
regarding the function of the atomic weight which determines the differences, in
oscillation i'requencies, between the lines in doublets and triplets.

     Equations are given, after the form of Rydberg's, for the principal series of
lithium and sodium and of potassium, rubidium, and caesium, and the calculated
numbers are in close agreement with the observed numbers.

                      By George J. Burch, M.A.^ F.R.S.

It is well known that white objects seen against a red background look greenish-

blue, and orange against a blue background.

--AThis phenomenon is shown in a striking manner in the following experiment
due to Hering :  small white diss is viewed with the left eye against a red

background, and another similar disc is viewed against a blue background with the

right eye. The discs are so placed as to occupy different positions in the field or

view. The result, when the light has been properly adjusted, is that the observer

sees an amethyst-blue disc and a topaz-yellow disc against a pale purple ground.

     The reason of this is demonstrated by the author in the following experiment :

Two pieces of glass, one red and the other blue, are inserted in a stereoscope in

place of the usual slide, each glass having two small squares of black paper on it.
Viewed binocularly the four squares appear as two. In front of the instrument,

but out of the direct line of sight, are two adjustable slits, and over the eye-lenses

of the stereoscope are two diffraction gratings. The position of the slits is so

arranged that the spectrum of the first order of the left-hand grating falls on the

two spectra, which can be adjusted to the same intensity, being thus seen side by
side, one with the left eye on a red ground, and the otlier with the right eye on a
blue ground. The red glass produces partial red blindness of the lefc eye, and the

spectrum seen by it lacks red, the other colours being unaltered. And for a similar

reason the spectrum seen by the right eye lacks blue, the effect being more notice-
able owing to the contrast of sensation in the two eyes. In the author's opinion
this experiment nffords further confirmation of the views of Scherffer, Darwin, and

Youns: in regard to contrast.

6. A Quartz-Calcite Symmetrical Doublet. By J. W. Gifford.

     The difficulty in constructing lenses of crystals consists chiefly in the double
refraction, whicti causes confusion. As quartz is a positive, and calcite a negative,

crystal, they tend to correct one another, altliough the separation of the lines in

quartz is only one-twentietli of that in calcite. Both lenses are cut with their
flxes corresponding to the axes of the crystals. The wave-length situated at the

point of greatest actinic activity is about 2748, as found by averaging the position

of bright lines of the principal spectra as follows :

7. The Production of an Artificial Light of the same Character as Day-

    light. By Arthur Dufton, M.A,, B.,Sc., and Walter M. Gardner,

     Bradford Technical College.

    It is a matter of common experience that many colours alter in appearance
when seen by artificial light.

    The extent to which colours may vary under different illumination is perhaps not
commonly known, but is well illustrated by the range of dyed cloths exhibited.
Amongst other patterns, one which is green by daylight becomes red-brown by

gaslight                             a violet  changes  to  purple ;  a  grey to  heliotrope ;  a  shade of  tan to a
                                  ;

brick red. Particularly striking is a pattern woven from specially dyed yarns,

which appears a uniform green colour by daylight, but which is figured by

gaslight. Seen by the light of the electric arc, the patterns show similar but less

marked changes.

  _ It may be of interest to indicate briefly how such peculiar changes of colour

arise. The colour of a body depends in the first place on the nature of the

incident light. In monochromatic red light a red appears much the same as in

daylight, but a yellow changes to red, a green is almost black, while blues and
violets become red.

     Gaslight shows a continuous spectrum from red to violet, but compared with
daylight is of a strong orange colour due to an excess of rays in the red, orange,
and j'ellow It does not, however, necessarily result that all colours appear
redder by gaslight. It is, indeed, well known that the majority of colours change
little by gaslight. This is due to the adaptability of the eye ; if the light becomes
redder, the eye becomes less sensitive to red ; if the light is deficient in gi-een, the
eye_ becomes more sensitive to green. Persons working by gaslight soon cease to

notice its intense orange colour. It results that a grey produced by mixture of
black and white appears grey under any illumination, and simple colours, such as
reds, oranges, and some greens giving light confined practically to one part of the
spectrum, undergo little change.

Generally, however, the colour of a body is due to a mixture of light from

different parts of the spectrum. All violet colours are transparent, not only for

violet, but also for blue and red light ; all blues transmit not only blue, violet, and

green light, but also more or less red. Consequently, whenever a blue or violet is

used in the production of what is called by artists a 'tertiary' colour, the general

Aresult is a colour having bright bands in diflerent parts of the spectrum.

mixture of red, blue, and yellow to produce a neutral grey will show bright

bands in the red and green-- complementary colours, resulting in a proportion of

white light. According to the exact position and intensity of these bands the

grey will become redder or greener or may even remain unchanged by gaslight.

Generally colours become redder under artificial light. This is due not merely

to the redder character of artificial lights as compared with daylight, but to the

peculiar transparency of colouring matters for red light. Among reds and yellow,

--we have many theoretically perfect colouring matters a perfect yellow being one
having sharp absorption in the violet and blue, and perfect transparency for green,
Ayellow, orange, and red rays.
                                                            perfect blue would be transparent for violet, blue,

and green, and opaque for the rest of the spectrum.

Apparently such a blue can only be obtained by means of cupric salts. All

other blue dyes and pigments we have examined agree in being more or less

transparent for red light. Even greens transmit some red. This peculiar trans-

parency of colours for red light is of primary importance in colour-matching. All
                                                                                                        --

dyers knovt Low persistent is the tendency to tlie development of ted in tlie

production of compound shades.

The need of an artificial light which should so closely resemble daylight as to

show colours in their true relationship has long been felt by workers in colour.

At present the electric arc light is largely used for colour work, but, as we have

seen, it is far from satisfactory.

The peculiar character of daylight is due essentially to the modification

produced by the atmosphere in the light from the sun. Light from a north sky

as usually adopted for colour work is deficient in red, orange, and yellow rays,

and consequently the light from a clear north sky is intensely blue.

Starting with the electric arc light as being nearest daylight in character, we

have attempted to imitate by direct absorption the effect produced by scattering

in the atmosphere.

--The light of an arc lamp consists of two distinct parts : (1) The light from
the glowing carbons                                                                                     the light of the arc itself, characterised by its richness in
                                                                                                ;  (2)

violet rays. In lamps of the enclosed arc type the length of arc is increased, and

consequently such lamps give a light richer in violet rays. Although arc lights

vary somewhat in the proportion of violet light, they all agree in being richer

than daylight in the amount of red, orange, and yellow rays, compared with the

amount of green and blue. Owing to the peculiar transparency of colours to red

light already noticed, it is of primary importance that the proportion of red light

should be carefully adjusted. Small variations in the amount of violet light are

of minor importance, owing to the eye being less sensitive to such rays, and also

because in mixing colours there is not the same tendency to develop a band of

violet as we have seen occurs in the red, since yellow colours generally have

complete absorption in the violet.

The required absorption of the less refrangible rays can be effected by means
Aof blue cupric salts.
                                                                                                        solution of copper sulphate shows strong absorption at

the extreme red of the spectrum, the absorption extending with diminishing

intensity into the green.

     For practical purposes the light from the arc is modified by passage through

pale blue glass coloured by means of copper. This coloured glass may conveniently

take the form of a globe replacing the ordinary globe of the arc light.

 1. On the Statistical Dynamics of Gas Theory as illustrated by Meteor
            Sivarms and Optical Rays, By Dr. J. Larmor, F.R.S.

     Imagine a cloud of meteors pursuing an orbit in space under outside attraction

--' in fact, in any conservative field of force. Let us consider a group of the

meteors around a given central one. As they keep together their velocities are
nearly the same. When the central meteor has passed into another part of the

orbit, the surrounding region containing these same meteors will have altered in

shape ; it will in fact usually have become much elongated. If we merely count
large and small meteors alike, we can define the density of their distribution in

space in the neighbourhood of this group : it will be inversely as the volume

occupied by them. Now consider their deviations from a mean velocity, say that

of the central meteor of the group ; we can draw from an origin a vector repre-
senting the velocity of each meteor, and the ends of these vectors will mark out a
region in the velocity diagram whose shape and volume wUl represent the

character and range of the deviation. It results from a very general proposition
in dynamics that as the central meteor moves along its path the region occupied
by the group of its neighbours multiplied by the corresponding region in their

velocity diagram remains constant. Or we may say that the density at the group

considered, estimated by mere numbers, not by size, varies during its motion pro-

portionally to the extent of the region on the velocity diagram which corresponds

to it.

This is true whether mutual attractions of the meteors are sensibly effective or

not ; in fact, the generalised form of this proposition, together with a set of
similar ones relating to the various partial groups of coordinates and velocity

components, forms an equivalent of the fundamental law of Action which is the

unique basis of dynamical theory.                                                                                                                        is the

to the densities at the group in its two positions. In our present case of mutual
attractions insensible, the volume density is thus proportional to vSco, because vSv

remains constant. Now the number of meteors that cross per unit time per unit

area of a plane at right angles to the path of the central meteor is equal to this
density multiplied by v : thus here it remains proportional to v'^Soi, as the central
meteor moves on. In the corpuscular formulation of geometrical optics this
result carries the general law that the concentration in cross-section of a beam of

light at different points of its path is proportional to the solid angular divergence
of the rays multiplied by the square of the refractive index, which is also directly
necessitated by thermodynamic principles ; as a special case it limits the possible
brightness of images in the well-known way.

   --In the moving stream of particles we have thus a quantity that is conserved in

each group namely, the ratio of the density at a group to the extent of the region

or domain on the velocity diagram which corresponds to it ; but this ratio may
vary in any way from group to group along the stream, while there is no restric-

tion on the velocities of the various groups. If two streams cross or interpenetrate

each other, or interfere in other ways, all this will be upset owing to the collisions.

Can we assign a statistical law of distribution of velocities that will remain
permanent when streams, which can be thus arranged into nearly homogeneous
groups, are crossing each other in all directions, so that we pass to a model of a
gas ? Maxwell showed that if the number of particles each of which has a total

Eenergy is proportional to e~''^ , where h is some constant (which defines the

temperature), while the particles in each group range uniformly, except as regards

this factor, with respect to distribution in position and velocity jointly, as above,

then this will be the case. In ^act, the chance of an encounter for particles of

Eenergies and E' will involve the product g-iiEg-hE' qj. g-h{E+E')^ g^^^ ^^^ encounter
Edoes not alter this total energy + E' ; while the domains or extents of ran^e of

two colliding groups each nearly homogeneous and estimated, as above, by devia-

tion from a central particle in position and velocity jointly, will have the same

product after the encounter as before by virtue of the Action principle. It
follows that the statistical chances of encounter, which depend on this joint pro-
duct, will be the same in the actual motion as are those of reversed encounter in
the same motion statistically reversed. But if the motion of a swarm with

velocities fortuitously directed can be thus statistically reversed, recovering its

previous  statistics, its  molecular  statistics  must  have become steady                                                                               in fact, we
                                                                                                                                                      ;

have in such a system just the same distribution of encountering groups in one

direction as in the reverse direction : thus we have here one steady state. The

same argument, indeed, shows that a distribution, such that the number per unit

volume of particles whose velocity deviations correspond to a given region in the

velocity diagram, is proportional to the extent of that region without this factor
g-hE^ will also be a steady one. This is the case of equable distribution in each

group as regards only the position and velocity diagrams conjointly ; but in this

case eacli value of the resultant velocity would occur witb a frequency propor-
tional to its square, and a factor such as c'^^ is required to keep down very high
values. The generalisations by Boltzmann and Maxwell to internal degrees of
freedom would lead us too far, the aim here proposed being merely concrete
illustration of the very general but purely analytical argument that is fully set
forth in tlie treatises of Watson, Burbury, and Boltzmann.

2. The Partition of Energy. By G. H. Bryan, Sc.D., F.R.S.^

Consider a system of particles in a field of force acting on one another with

forces which are functions of the distances between them. wIf u, v, are the

velocity components of a particle of mass m, V, the potential energy of the system,

the rate of increase of the component of kinetic energy, ^ mu", is given by

        ----d
        ,, ,,.   =^  ~ u dV

        (i mu-)

If the probability of any given motion of the system is equal to tlie probability ot
the reversed motion for given positions of the particles, then since equal positive
and negative values of ti are equally probable it appears that the mean rate of

increase of i mu- estimated from probability considerations is zero. Now form the

second differential coefficient of i 7)iu~ with respect to the time, which may be called

the acceleration of this energy component. AVe obtain

~-U mu-) = - \ -u2[u~ + v-- + w^ 1--
        m\dx)
dl.-^-           \ d.L-                            dij      dzj dic

If we are given the probability that the coordinates of the system may be between

given limits, then a condition for the stationary state is that the mean values of

Wethe accelerations of ^ mir, ^ }izv'-, i mic- are zero.  thus obtain a system of

equations of energy equilibrium for the system, which are sullicient to determine

the mean values of the components of kinetic energy, provided the system is such

that the mean values of products of velocities such as MjVj, ?/jMo, or u^v.^ vanish.

If this is not the case the conditions for a stationary state involve writing down

further expressions for the accelerations or second differential coefficients of these

Telocity products, and equating their mean values to zero.

In this way the mean values of the squares and products of the velocity

components for a stationary distribution are expressible in terms of the mean values

of the squares of the force components, and the second differential coefficients of the

potential energy with respect to the coordinates.

In this preliminary investigation the .simplest possible illustrative examples

are considered. For a system of two particles moving in a straight line and acting

on one another with finite forces, the partition of energy follows Maxwell's law,

and the mean product of the velocities vanishes if there is no external field of

force. If there is a field of external force, this is no longer in general the case.

We thus have some justification for the belief that in a polyatomic gas Maxwell's

law of partition may no longer hold good, and this may account for the experi-

mental result that this law is verified approximately only when translational and

rotational energy are alone taken into account.

The principal advantage of studying the problem of energy-partition from the

consideration of energy accelerations is that it leads to results for a perfectly

reversible dynamical system somewhat analogous to the irreversible properties of

temperature. The property that heat tends to flow from a hotter to a colder body

is represented on this view by the property that when two stationary systems are

allowed to act on one another, then if a certain inequality is satisfied energy is

accelerated from one system to the other, and the direction of the acceleration is

Lorentz published by the University of Leiden.

determined by the sign of tlie inequality. This last is unaltered by reversing the

Telocity componeuts of all the particles.

    In order that a stationary distribution of energy may be possible^ certain con-

ditions represented by inequalities must hold good, and further conditions, which
may or may not be identical with these, must be satisfied in order that the distri-

butions may be stable. These properties may pf rbaps have a physical interpretation
in the notion that change of state takes place when the conditions in question

cease to hold good. Finally, the fact that the Newtonian potential satisfies

Laplace's equation may possibly give an exceptional character to the phenomena of

energy-partition in the cosmic universe. It is also evident that expressions for the

second differential coefficients of squares and products of velocity components may
theoretically be written down for a dynamical system of the most general character,

and applied to determine the partition of energy between the molecules and the

ether.

     3. Note 011 the Propagation of Electric Waves along Parallel Wires.

                          By Prof. W. B. Morton, M.A.

     In the ' Annalen der Physik ' for June 1900, a very complete investigation of

this problem has been published by G. Mie. He finds expressions for the wave-

length and damping of the oscillations, involving a series of ascending powers of the
ratio of radius of wires to distance apart. The object of this note is to point out
that the approximate solution, in which the square of this ratio is neglected, can
be very easily obtained from the known solution for a single wire, as worked out
by Professor J. J. Thomson and by Sommerfeld. The formula for the damping
agrees with that given by Heaviside's simple theory when Lord Rayleigh's high-
frequency values are used for the resistance and inductance. Attention is called
to an error in the formula for the K^ function in the work of Thomson, Sommerfeld,
and Mie, arising probably from an erratum in Heine's 'Kugelfuuctionen.' It afl'ects
the numerical values worked out in Sommerfeld and Mie's papers.

But owing to (4) no physical quantity at .r y s can be immediately affected by the
change at x' y' z'. The change can have no effect whatever at x y z till after the

Fexpiration of the time ;^. If therefore be any physical quantity, we must have

Fu cannot denote energy, which is inconsistent with (5).

^because -^- is not generally small.

3. On the Similarity of Effect of Electrical Stimidus on Inorganic and
    Living Substances. By Jagadis Chundee Bose, M.A., D.Sc, Pro-

    fessor of Physical Science, Presidency College, Calcutta.

If we take a piece of living tissue, say a piece of muscle, and subject it to an

electric stimulus, there will be produced a contraction; the stimulus causes a

rearrangement of the particles of the living substance by which the form of muscle

is changed. On the cessation of stimulus the muscle, recovering from the mole-

cular strain, gradually attains its original shape. The effect of stimulus on nerves

is, however, not apparent ; there is no change of form. The molecular disturbance
due to stimulus can, however, be detected in an indirect manner from certain

electromotive variations that are produced. If now a mass of metallic filings be

taken and subjected to electric shocks, there is no visible change. The substance

appears to be irresponsive or dead to stimulus. Are inorganic substances then

really irresponsive ? Could this apparent want of response not be due after all to

our inability to detect the profound molecular changes that may have nevertheless

taken place in the substance under the action of stimulus ? In nen'es it is seen

that the molecular changes can only be detected indirectly by an electric method.

The author describes an electric method based on the variation of conductivity,

by which the molecular change due to an electi'ic stimulus in an inorganic
substance is detected and measured, CurvBS are in this manner obtained with the

conductivity v.ariation (proportional to molecular effect) as ordinates, and the time

of exposure to the stimulus or the time of recovery from the effect of stimulus as

                                                                        '

of inorganic matter, similar effects being produced not only (I) in all elementary-

--substances metals, non-metals, and metalloids^but also (2) in metallic compounds,

such as the chlorides, bromides, iodides, oxides, and sulphides.
     Comparisons are next made of the molecular response in both inorganic and

living substances under varying conditions :

the various effects of radiation on this artificial retina explain many obscure
phenomena of vision.

      Parallel experiments are then described with the artificial and the real

 retina :

     1. On the effect of short exposure to the action of radiation.
     2. On the effect of intermittent radiation ; on the question of the presence or

absence of ' flicker ' depending on the intensity of radiation and also on the

rapidity of intermittence.

     3. On the peculiarity of the visual sensation curve, as explained by the curve

of effect ou the artificial retina.

     4. Ou the different elements of retinal fatigue.
     5. On certain curious reversal effects.
     C. On after-oscillation and visual recuiTence.
     7. On the novel phenomenon of binocular alternation of vision, and on the

analysis of superposed images by alternate after-vision.

     8. On the persistence of retinal oscillation, and its continuity witli the phe-
nomenon of memory.

      In all the phenomena described above there is seen a remarkable similarity
 of effect of external stimulus on both living and non-living forms of matter. It is
difficult to draw a line and say, ' Here the physical process ends and the physio-
logical process begins,' or ' These are the lines of demarcation that separate the
phj'sical, the physiological, and the beginning of psychical processes.' Iso such
 arbitrary lines can be drawn, there being no abrupt break of continuity.

4. Wireless Telephony. By Sir William Henry Preece, K.C.B., F.R.S.

     The first experiments in this direction were made in the month of February
 1894, across Loch Ness in the Highlands. Ou that occasion trials were made t'">
 determine the laws governing the transmission of Morse signals by the electro-
 magnetic method of wireless telegraph}-, which has formed the subject of frequent
 reports to this Section since 1884; two parallel wires well earthed were taken, one
 on each side of the lake, and arrangements were made by means of which the wires
 could be systematically shortened with a view of ascertaining the minimum lengtli
 necessary to record satisfactory signals. It occurred to Mr. Gavey, who was
 experimenting, to compare telephonic with telegraphic signals, i.e., to ascertain
 whether articulate speech could be maintained under the same conditions as Morse
 signalling. The trials showed that it was possible to exchange speech across the
 Loch at an average distance of 1'3 mile between the parallel wires when the
 l^^no-th of tho wires themselves was reduced to four miles ou each siac of tiie

 water.
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                    G39

What led to this train of thoufrht was the fact that although the volume of

telegraphic current was immensely greater than that of a telephonic current,

whenever, through want of balance as a loop, disturbance was evident then tele-

phonic cross-talk was also manifest. In other words, a weak telephonic current

was apparently as powerful a disturber as a strong telegraphic one.

The sensation created in 1897 by Mr. Marconi's application of Hertzian waves,

distracted attention froui the more practical and older method. Mr. Evershed

and Principal Oliver Lodge had, in the meantime, much advanced the system by

introducing admirable call systems.

In 1899 I conducted some careful experiments on the Menai Straits which

determined tlie fact that the maximum effects with telephones are produced when

the parallel wires are terminated by ' earth " plates in the sea iLself. It became

quite evident that the ordinary inductive eflects are much enhanced by conductive

etl'ects through the water, and that in consequence shorter wires are practical. No

special apparatus seems necessary. The ordinary telephonic transmitters and re-

ceivers were used without induction coils.

     It became desirable to establish communication between the islands or rocks
known as the Skerries and the mainland of Anglesey, and it was determined to

do this by means of wireless telephony. The lighthouse at the Skerries was

Awanted to be in communication with the coastguard station at Cemlyn.  wire

750 yards in length was erected along the Skerries, and on the mainland one of

three and a half miles from a point opposite the Skerries to Cemlyn. Each line

terminates by an earth plate into the sea. The average distance between the

parallel portions of the two wires is 2'8 miles. Telephonic communication is

readily maintained and the service is a good one.

Further experiments with wireless telephony have recently been made by Mr.

Gavey between Rathlin Island, on the north coast of Ireland, and the mainland.

The east and west portions of the island of Rathlin are about eight miles from the

mainland, but a tongue of land projects southward to within a distance of four miles.

Communication was required between the lighthouse near the north-eastern corner of

the island and the mainland, and the question for solution was whether an over-

head line running the whole length of the island from east to west was necessary

southern peninsula would serve. The prelixninaiy experiments th<it h^.ve been
made prove conclusively that communication, both telegi'aphic and telephonic, has

been readily maintained by means of temporary wires established across the neclc

now a practical and commercial sjstem.
    No experiments have yet been made with ships, but it would appear simple to

speak by telephone between ship and ship or between ship and shore to consider-

able distances by means of a circuit formed of copper wire terminating at each

phones.

 5. On the Apparent Emission of Cathode Rays from an Electrode at Zero
                    Potential. By Charles E. S. Phillips.

    It has been noticed by many people who work with X-ray or other vacuum

bulbs that numerous bright green patches occasionally appear upon the inner
surface of the glass walls of a bulb while a discharge is passing, especially during

the process of exhaustion.
     These green flecks varv considerably from time to time in shape as well as in

position, and efforts have fceen made to connect their existence either with want

of uniformity in the composition of the glass or with irregularities in the surface
of the negative electrode.

    I have already, in another place,^ given some account of an experiment made
With the object of clearing up this uncertainty, and now beg to supplement that

work with the following observations as to the cause of the phenomenon. The
experiment just referred to consisted in usino; a pivoted disc of alumimum as the
negative electrode in a bulb containing rarefied air, so that when green patches
appeared a rotational movement of the disc (actuated by means of an external
magnet) would show whether the patches of green moved in a corresponding
manner or not. It was seen that they did so move.

   A distinct feature of the experiment, however, consisted in ascertammg

whether those flecks which persisted after the discbarge had ceased were still
sensitive to movements of the cathode. This also was found to be the case. The
proof, therefore, that the green patches were associated with an emission from the

cathode appeared complete.       that  subsequently          to  the  passage                         j,  a   ,. ,       and,

I therefore venture to bring forward the following suggestions, supported by

farther experiments.

    When a piece of metal is placed in a rarefied atmosphere and, mad^e t,he nega-

tive pole for an electrical discharge passing across the attenuated gas, innumerable
small bricrht specks of light appear over the surface of the metal. It was found

myconvenient in  particular case to use an iron              electrode     for observations                       of this
                                                                                          _

eifect, because it had the advantage of being readily magnetisable from without.

The addition of a similar iron electrode to act as the anode determined the shape

of the magnetic field. With such an apparatus it could be seen that the bright

spots appeared principally upon the cathode while the discharge passed, and that
tlie creation of a magnetic field between the electrodes made visible the individual
luminous streams of gas emanating from those tiny points of light. The paths of

these luminous streams, becoming bent by the action of the magnetic field, followed
the direction of the lines of magnetic force and exhibited a tendency to become

spiral in accordance with well-known laws. In this way a fine layer of sodium

upon the anode was caused to fluoresce through the action of the negatively
electrified particles beating down upon it. One was able, in fact, by this means

to cast shadows of objects placed in the paths of the bent streams, and at a pres-
sure considerably higher than that necessary for the production of the well-known
cathode shadow effects. In the above case, however, the method served to clearly

establish the fact that the bright points of light upon the surface of the cathode

indicated the places from which the jets of gas originated.^
     The number of these jets became less as the fxhauftion was continued, and

individual streams were very clearly seen owing to the action of tlie magnetic

field. When the discharge began to cause fluorescence in the glass of the bulb
some green patches made their appearance, and, in some cases, when the cathode
was magnetised a bright spot, which was previously judged to indicate the origin
of a o-reen patch upon the glass, would shift to a new position upon the electrode.
In all such cases the corresponding patch also moved in a similar manner upon

the  glass.                                                          upon  the                ,,                .,

     At sufficiently  high  exhaustions  the  bright         spots                         electrode         disappeared

euti'relv, although green flecks were still visible upon the glass. But a movemen'-.

as before of the "electrode as well as its magnetisation gave results consistent with

previous observations.          when     the  discharge                                 ,  t,he  b, ul,,b    was  s,topped;,

     Under these conditions,                                     through

-'roen flecks were still visible for about ten seconds.
A° positively charged body was brought up to the outside of the bulb and the
Apatches brightened considerably.             negative charge similarly placed extin-

guished the flecks completely.

     Finally, vacuum bulbs, such as X-ray lamps, &c., exhibiting green flecks while
in operation, were generally found to deteriorate if laid aside for a mouth or two,

in the first place, the bright points of light upon the surface of the cathode are

due to the emission of fine jets of gas ; also that, such jets, if negatively charged,

may he made to cast shadows of objects suitably placed in their paths. It is at

the same time clear that the green flecks referred to above are due, during the

passage of a discharge, to these same jets of gas impinging upon the inner side of

the glass walls, and that, under the conditions existing immediately subsequent

to the passage of the discharge, streams of gas continue to be emitted from

the pores of the electrodes. In spite of the fact that (with the electrodes con-

nected to earth) these streams consist of unelectrified particles, they assume

that property of ionisation during their passage across the space within the

bulb which appears to be essential to the production of local fluorescence in

the glass upon which they impinge.

     This latter eSect, while explaining the process by which a cathode emission

may appear to originate at an electrode with no electrical charge upon it, is one

to which I wish to draw especial attention, for there is reason to believe that the

speed at which the individual particles, constituting the jets, move cannot exceed

the rate at which sound is propagated in the rarefied medium.

     It is therefore interesting to find that, under such circumstances, fluorescence

was produced in the glass upon which the streams impinged.

    As many of the observations referred to here were made during the course o£
an investigation into the diselectrifying action of magnetism now being carried

out by myself at the Davy-Faraday Laboratory of the Royal Institution, I desire

myto express       indebtedness to the managers of that institution for the facilities

which they have kindly placed at my disposal.

6. On VoUa-electromotive Force of Alloi/s^ and a Test for Chemical Union.
                                 By Dr. G. Gore, F.R.S.

HowThe question has been asked, '                                                                                                                                              far does change in physical properties,

such as electromotive force, &c., enable us to detect the existence of a compound

in an alloy ? ' *

     In reply to this I beg leave to say that whilst a (/ain of mean electromotive
force of an alloy when used as a positive plate in a voltaic cell indicates that the

constituents of the alloy are simply mixed together or dissolved in each other a

loss of 7nean electromotive force shows that they are chemically combined.

It is well known that simple dilution of an electrolyte usually dimimshes the

apparent electromotive force of a simple voltaic couple immersed in it. In a

research, however, on 'The Relations of Volta-electromotive Force to Latent

Heat, &c., of Electrolytes,' - I found that in eighteen out of nineteen cases of

--mere dilution of electrolytes with water, on measuring the apparent electromotive

forces of a simple voltaic couple immersed first, in water alone ; secondly, in an

--undiluted electrolyte ; and thirdly, in the same electrolyte diluted a gain of mean

electromotive force was produced by the diluted liquid above that of the tnean

amount as calculated from the separate amounts excited by the water alone and

by the undiluted liquid. And I further found by a similar process in a subsequent

research on 'A Method of Measuring Loss of Energy due to Chemical Union '^

that when the ingredients of two electrolytes (such as an acid and au alkali)

mixed together with strong chemical union, a loss instead oi&gain oimean amount

of electromotive force occurred                                                                                                                                                and that when  two  electrolytes  mixed  together
                                                                                                                                                                            ;

without any degree of such union, as they are considered to do in cases of more

dilution, a gain of tneati amount of such force nearly always took place. Similarly

with metals dissolved in mercury and with solid alloys used as positive electrodes,

     All the facts appear to be consistent with the theory that dilution increases

                             By Professor F. G. Bailt.

A d'Arsonval galvanometer of moderate resistance is used, and a powerful

lantern throws a conspicuous circle of light on to a large semi-transparent scale.

A high resistance and a set of shunts allow of the measurement of electromotive

forces, the scale being adjusted to read directly in volts or multiples, and a range

of '05 volt to 300 volts being obtained. By the omission of the high resistances
the galvanometer and shunts maybe used for ordinary purposes, and may be adjusted

to measure thermo-electric forces. Currents from '5 milliampere up to 30 amperes

are measured by the difference of potential between the ends of a low resistance,

two alternative resistances being used, and the range is improved by the use of

Aresistances in series with the galvanometer.  tapping and a reversing key are

fixed on the box.

                         By John B. B. Burke, M.A.

When a ring or electrodeless discharge is sent through a gas an after-glow is

produced, at pressures within certain limits, in air varying between 0'7 mm. and
A()'02 mm.
            series of experiments was carried out to investigate the cause of

this glow, and it was found that it was due to particles which do not carry a

charge of electricity, but nevertheless produce conductivity in the gas as they pass

through it. They are not stopped in their motion through charged wire-gauze

electrodes, nor by an electromotive force, and yet cause a current to pass between

two such electrodes situated lower down in a long vacuum tube. The glow

diffuses through narrow brass tubing which is well earthed, proving that the glow

itself does not carry a charge. When the diffusion takes place through a brass

tap between two large bulbs the glow lasts three or four times as long in the one

that the discharge has not passed through ; and it was found that the glow in the

former was destroyed instantaneously when a discharge was sent from a small

induction coil between two electrodes in a side tube, showing that the glow was

destroyed by the ionised gas.

The conductivity observed was probably due to the breaking up of the phos-

phorescent molecules by the ions produced by the spark as the glow moved through

them.

      4. Sur les Relations entre la Geomefrie Projective et la Mecanique.
                              Par M. Cyparissos Stephanos.

     Monsieur Stephanos explique et precise le role de la geometrie projective dans la
mecanique, et surtout en statique, en s'appuyant sur ce fait fondamental, peut-etre
non encore remarque, que les seules transformations entre les coordonuees pliicke-
rienues d'une force qui respectent I'^quilibre (c'est-a-dire, qui transforment un
systeme quelconque de forces en equilibre, applique a un corps solide libre, en un
autre svsteme de forces ^galement en Equilibre) sont precisement des transforma-
tions lineaires et homogenes. Les transformations liueaires correspondent dans le
plan aux homographies planes, tandis que dans I'espace elles correspondent aoit a
des homographies, soit a des correlations.

      Cela etant, les considerations et les methodes de la geom(5trie projective (taut
syntlietique qu'analytique) sont indispensables en statique, et surtout en statique
graphique, non seulement pour la coordination des r(5sultats d^ja connus, mais
aussi pour I'assurement general et le progres ulterieur de cette partie de la
mecanique.

      Enfin M. Stephanos attire particulierement I'attention sur les affinites de
I'espace (transformations homographiques qui laissent invariable le plan a I'infini).
Les affinites ont seules cette vertu remarquable de respecter fidelement les
diagrammes de la statique en faisant transformer point par point tout diagramme
de forces en equilibre en un autre diagramme de forces egalement en equilibre.
Par centre les transformations homographiques g^nerales, aussi que les correlations
 de I'espace, donnent imm6diatement les lignes d'action des forces transformees, mais
non leurs intensit^s, dont la determination demande une construction auxiliaire.

     So far as I can learn it was first pointed out by Sommerfeld,' that a Riemann's
surface might be here employed, and with the help of a Multiple Space, problems
in Electrostatics, Electric Conduction, Hydrodynamics, Sound, and Conduction of

mHeat, in which the boundaries are planes meeting at an angle ^, have now been

solved by Images.

     The ideas involved may be illustrated by the potential problem in which the
boundary is the semi-infinite plane 6 = 0.

we have to deal is defined by the range of o< 6< 2it, and the behaviour of the solu-

      Similar ideas enter into the solution of the other questions of this nature :

where the ordinary Image method would reproduce singularities in the original
space, by taking a function of a suitable period (a Riemann's space of the proper

order) this result is avoided.

    The problems in potential involving spherical boundaries may be solved by
Inversion from the above. Hobson has considered,^ by discussion in series, the
direct solution of the cases of the circular disc and spherical bowl. By a method

similar to Sommerfeld's, I have found the solution for the general case.

     Taking the coordinate system employed by Hobson, in which the position of

the point P is defined by

              P  =        l1 og PA,

                                 p^3'

              e= ZAPB,

              (p = azimuthal angle,

the boundary d = constant, represents a portion of a spherical surface, of which the
rim of the circular disc, whose diameter is AB, is the base. If we are dealing with
the space bounded by an infinite plane with a circular hole, we define this
region by

                                               o<d<2n,

and associate with it that defined by

                                                 -2Tr<6<0.
Corresponding to the singularity at {6'), we shall have one at {-6').

factors of all the numbers between (2^^ T 1020), i.e. between 16,776,196 and

16,778,236, which brings them all withia the power of the existing large factor-

tables. This determines the whole of the Hiffh Primes (117 in number) within the

above range, as in table below :

9. On the Symbolism appropriate to the Study of Orthogonal aiid Boolian
     Invariant Systems which appertain to Binary and other Quantics.
     By Major P. A. MacMahon, F.B.S.

     It has been customary to study the theory of invariants by considering the
invariants of the general linear substitution as of primary importance, and to pay
comparatively little attention to the invariant forms connected with the orthogonal
and BooUan substitutions. These latter substitutions are particular, and give rise
to a number of forms which include those which arise from the general substitu-
tion ; so that from one point of view the ordinary invariant theory is a particular
case of the theory of orthogonal or of Booliau invariants. This is the view taken
in this paper ; the orthogonal and Boolian systems are studied by means of six
invariant symbolic factors, and at any time the theory of Clebsch and Gordau
and Aronhold can be derived by restricting attention to the two symbolic factors
employed by them.

10. .4 Quintic Curve ca/nnot have more than fifteen real Points oj Inflexion.

                               By A. B. Basset, F.R.S.

Zeuthen has shown ' that not more than one third of the total number of pointa

of inflexion that a quartic curve can have can be real, I propose to show that a

similar proposition holds good in the case of a quintic curve.

   A quintic curve cannot have more than six double points, nor more than forty

five points of inflexion.

A B ALet
            C be the triangle of reference ; and let be a triple point composed

Bof three real crunodes ; and let be a real crunode. Then the equation of the

quintic is

                           yXa-Mj + ay^s +  =                                   (1)

where «,,, v^, Wg are binary cubics in li and y.
     Since each tangent at the triple point is composed of two real nodal tangents,

the three tangents at this point count as six real stationary tangents. If, however,

each tangent at the triple point has a contact of the third order with its respective
branch (which is the highest contact that a tangent at a triple point on a quintic
can have), each tangent counts three times as a real stationary tangent ; and there-
fore the foregoing singularity reduces the number of real points of inflexion by nine.
In this case, v.^ = ku^, and (1) becomes

                           =(a- + kay)u^ + y'-iv^  (2). . . . .

    If each of the tangents at the crunode B has a contact of the fourth order with

its respective branch (which is the highest contact which a tangent at a node on a

quintic can have), each tangent counts three times as a stationary tangent, and
therefore the foregoing singularity reduces the number of real points of inflexion
by six.

   We shall now show that these two singularities can coexist oo a quintic

     Let

                           "3" ^ (X, lM,v,^y_ ^, yf

                            = (I,  VI,  n, py^l3,  yY

                           ,

then (2) may be arranged in the form

              my^/33{X(a- + kay) + ly'} + /32y{/i(a« + kay) +      . . (3)

respective branches              m/i = pX, = pl

and (3) becomes

={X(a-
                 + kay)  +  ly- (/S''    +  pfi'-y  +  o-/3y-)  + -Bry '(a"  +  A:ay)  + py'                 . (4)
                                      }

     Equation (4) shows that the two foregoing singularities can coexist on a quintic.
Moreover, there is nothing in the preceding equations of condition which prevents

A Bvalues being assigned to the constants which make the singularities at and

real. Hence a quintic can have fifteen real points of inflexion. If, however, a
quintic could have seventeen real points of inflexion, it would be possible to

determine the constants so that C should be a real crunode. This would require

that

                                            = ==jy 0, Zo- 0, -srZ;

in which case the quintic would break up into factors. Hence, fifteen is the

maximum number of real points of inflexion that a quintic can have.

     The fact that in the case of cubics, quartics, and quintics, only one third of the
total number of points of inflexion can be real, leaves very little room to doubt

that this law is universally true in the case of all algebraic curves.

11. On a Central-difference Interpolation Formula.
          By Professor J. D. Everett, F.R.S.

The best-known formulae for interpolation by ' central differences' are difficult

to carry in the memory on account of their unsystt-matic aspect, one law being

applicable to the odd and another to the even terms. This disadvantage does not

attach to the formula here proposed.

     Let M^) and m, be two tabulated values between which a value is to be inserted

at distance p from z/^ and q from u^, so that jo + 9 = 1
    If we regard u,, and u^ as ordmates joined by a straight hne cut in the

required ratio, the ordinate of the point of section is qii^+pUi, which is a first

Aapproximation, exact when second differences vanish.                           second approximation,

exact when fourth differences vanish, is

where in conformity with the notation explained in my paper of last year,^

Afi^<(, ASt<i are the central differences of the second order con-esponding respectively

to u,, «j. This is a sufficient approximation when g\ of the sum of the two central
fourth differences is negligible. The complete formula is

^ (q + r)        ^. . (q-r) r r                        »y{p + r) . . . (j>-r)                            ""

where the numerators and denominators are factorials, all having 2?- + I factors

with unity as the common diflference.
     The only novelty about the formula is the simplicity of its form. Each pair of

terms is equivalent to a pair of terms in the second of the two ceutral-dift'erence
formulse of Stirling (Methodus Bifercntialis, Prop. 20), which is reproduced in

some modern works ; but that formula contains odd as well as even differences.

    Since ^-l is --p, and^> -- 1 is -q, the above formula may be written

the best shape for practical calculatiou, ami which furnishes an intermediate step
in comparing the formula with Stirling's.

     To prove the formula, note first that since the second central difference A8f(.T)

0Tf{x + A.v) -- 2f{.v)+f{.v~Ax) is not altered by changing the sign of Aa;, the
value of AS/(y) is the same when the independent variable pis as when it is q.

    Denote(?^^"^---j|-[) by ct>^(q), so that <p,,(q) = g, and cf>,iq) = (?^^J|(|=1)

    Then AS0r((/) = A8d)r-i(g).

F (p), we have

F(l) = ?/,,     a8F(1 j = a8u^,                A'-S'-F(l) = A^d'ii,.

    FHence (p) coincides with u for all the tabulated values that can be built up

2r + 2 values of which Ug and m, are the two central.

that in each inverse operation A-^ or §-% the arbitrary constant is to be so taken

     12. On Newton^s Contributions to Central Difference Interpolation.
                         By Professor J. D. Everett, F.R.S}

      After a portion of the preceding abstract had been sent to the printer, I
discovered that the two formulae known as Stirling's are really due to Newton.
They are given in Prop. 3 of Newton's ' Methodus Dift'erentialis,' which is the closing
one of a collection of minor treatises by Newton, published, with his permission, in

1711 by W. Jones, who states in the preface that this particular tract has been

transcribed by him from a manuscript in Newton's handwriting.

    I have also found in Lemma 5, which follows Prop. 40 of the third book of the

' Principia,' what is doubtless the earliest statement of the ordinary interpolation
formula, now usually written

     Newton gives it in a geometric shape, x, x--\, x -- 2, &c., being represented by
lines, and he defines Au^, not as «, -- u, but as --u,, u^, with a similar convention

for higher difierences, thus reversing the signs of all odd differences as compared
with modern notation. Owing, 1 presume, to these disguises, the formula appears
to have hitherto escaped recognition.

     Satisfactory progress has been made in the work since the report presented at
the Dover meeting, and it is gratifying to observe that the method of exploring the
air by means of instruments, recording graphically and lifted by kites, which was
initiated at Blue Hill in 1894, is now being extensively used on the continent of

Europe.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  651

    By substituting larger wire as a flying line, and so diminisliing relatively the

wind resistance, and by employing kites that exert a greater component of lift, the
average height of the flights thus far made during the present year has been

increased 1,473 feet and the maximum height 3,350 feet over the corresponding
heights in 1899. From January to the end of July, 1900, records were obtained

during fifteen flights, the average height attained by the meteorograph being 8,875
feet above the adjacent ocean. Twelve of these flights exceeded 3,300 feet, ten
exceeded 6,500 feet, six exceeded 9,800 feet, and two exceeded 13,000 feet. In the
highest flight on Jidy 21, six kites attached at intervals to four and three-quarter
miles of steel wire lifted the meteorograph 15,170 feet above Blue Hill. This
height of 15,800 feet above the sea surpasses the greatest altitude at which

meteorological observations have been made from a balloon in America.' The

records obtained during 1899 have been reduced by my assistant Mr. Clayton ; a

continuation of his studies of cyclonic and anticyclonic phenomena by means of
kites was published as Bulletin No. 7 of the Observatory, and a summary appeared

in ' Nature.'

4. Charts ilhistrating the Weather of the North Atlantic Ocean in the

     Winter o/' 1898-99. By Captain Campbell-Hrpworth, Meteorological

        Office.

     The Meteorological Council, having received a large amount of information
from the logs of Atlantic steamships, have investigated the remarkably stormy
weather experienced on that ocean in the winter of 1898-99, and charts for sixty
consecutive days have been prepared exhibiting the atmospheric conditions over
the sea and a great extent of the adjacent continents. The discussion has shown
that while severe storms were of common occurrence on the ocean America was
suffering an exceptionally cold season, while Europe enjoyed almost unexampled

mildness.

     Through the first few days the charts show comparatively undisturbed weather
on the frequented ocean routes, but from Christmas onward hardly a day passed
without more or less violent gales. The cyclonic depressions passed out to the
Atlantic at various points between Florida and Labrador, some crossing quickly to

--the vicinity of the British Isles, others and particularly the worst one in February
--making very slow progress. Remarks in the logs testify to the tempestuous

character of the season by frequent references to fierce, violent gales of hurricane
force, mountainous, tremendous, and terrific seas, low temperatures, and blinding
squalls of rain, hail, and snow. In the wild weather towards the close of December
waves from 45 feet to 52 feet in height were reported, the s.s. Farkman was dis-
abled, and other vessels sustained damage. At the beginning of January a
hurricane, with terrific squalls, raged on and near the Ray of Biscay, resulting in
various shipping casualties. From January 6 to 10 violent gales were continuous

and damaged many ships. On the 23rd the s.s. Turanian broke her propeller shaft

and sustained other damage during a cyclone with a mountainous cross sea running.
The disturbance centred midway across the ocean on the 30th caused much disaster
to shipping. In the hurricance, with terrific squalls and dangerous seas, the
Cunarder Pavonia was disabled and the s.s. Rossmore sprang a leak.

     The stauiichest ships afloat were unable to withstand the frightful violence of
the hurricanes of February, the powerful Cunarder Lucanta and the Hamburg-
American Co.'s Fiirst Bismarck being delayed about three days, others a longer
time. On February 2 the barometer fell, near the banks of Newfoundland, to
27*74 inches, and a rise of ^ inch was registered on the R.M.S. Lucania in two

352 REPORT-- 1900.

     The western side of the ocean was in great turmoil towards the close of the
period under investigation, a depression skirting the American coast causing

severe hurricanes and snowstorms, a great blizzard blocking up New York, and

for twenty-four hours not a single vessel was able to pass Sandy Hook inward or

outward.

     On February 11 the barometer on the far north of the Atlantic was down to
nearly '2S^ inches, while at the same time there was a reading of 31"42 inches
at Swift Current in Canada, believed to be the highest record known in America.

     There was a very striking difference in the conditions obtaining on the continents
on either side of the ocean. The American winter was characterised by almost
persistent and severe cold in December and February, and to a less extent in
January. As on the ocean February proved by far the worst month, the Weather
Bureau at Washington stating that ' the overshadowing event of the month was
the severe and widespread cold, culminating in a freeze that for duration and
severity stands unparalleled in the history of the Weather Bureau." Temperatures
below zero Fahrenheit were registered over an extensive area, many places went
below --40°, the lowest reported being --61° at Fort Logan, Montana, on the
night of the 10th. Severe frost extended southward to the Gulf of Mexico, both
the swift-flowing rivers and Gulf water at the mouths of the Mississippi being

frozen over.

     Europe, on the other hand, had an exceedingly mild, open season, there being
an entire absence of the usual January cold over the British Isles, while the
temperatures recorded round February 10 were unprecedentedly high, Greenwich,
Brussels, and Paris being higher by several degrees than ever before experienced
in February. At Liege the thermometer rose to 70°-5, or 131^° above the

American minimum of the following night. The exceptionally high temperatures
extended eastward to the Ural Mountains, and even Davos Platz, an Alpine
station at an elevation of 5,120 feet, had five days with afternoon maxima

between 60° and 63°.

              By John Hopkinson, F.E.Met.Soc, Assoc.Inst.C.E.

     This is the third of a series of papers on the rainfall of the English counties,
an account of the rainfall of the South- Western Counties having been given at the
Bristol Meeting of the Association in 1898, and the rainfall of the South-Eastern
Counties having been similarly treated at Dover last year. The counties here
considered as northern are Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland, Westmoreland,
Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cheshire, Derby, Nottingham, and Lincoln. They comprise
an area of 18,383 square miles, which is considerably over one-third that of

England, and more than one-seventh that of the British Isles. The mean

monthly rainfall for the ten years 1881 to 1890 at ninety-four stations in these
counties has been computed, and the mean annual rainfall at 184 stations, being
one to the nearest 100 square miles in each county. Thus, for example, the mean
annual rainfall of the smallest county, Nottingham (837 square miles), is deduced
from the records of eight stations, and that of the largest, Yorkshire (6,836 square
miles), from the records of fifty-eight stations. Each Riding of Yorkshire has
been similarly treated, except that there is one station short of the full number for
the North Riding, one more than the right number being allotted to the East
Riding in order to bring the total for the whole county correct.

 mean 3'75 ins. ; and in the third group the same month is the wettest, with a
 mean fall of 3-20 ins.

      Nottingham and Lincoln are the driest counties throughout the year, except in

 February, when Durham is the driest, and in May, when Durham and Northumber-

 land are drier than Nottingham. Cumberland and Westmoreland are the wettest
 throughout the year, Cumberland usually being the wetter of the two, but in
 January, March, October, November, and December the greatest diflerence between
 them is 05 in.

     There are two methods that may be used to solve the problem, the direct and the

indirect method, via KirchhoS''s laws. The latter seeins preferable, as, on account
of the freedom of choice of a substance, the mathematical work may be simplified
by choosing the simplest kind of substance.

     The substance here chosen is a gas, supposed to consist of atoms carrying
electric charges. As a preliminary the question whether any result can be
obtained from the data is investigated by the method of ' dimensions,' and the

formulae

and

are found.

     In any such formula the constants must have values neither very great nor

very small. This is tested and found to be true. On attempting to carry out the

mathematical calculations suggested, the radiation is found to vary as the tempera-
ture ; a quite impossible result. Various modifications of the nature of the

hypothetical gas selected are considered and dismissed as unsatisfactory.

     The truth of the second law of thermodynamics is made to depend on the con-

stancy of the ionic charges. This indicates that the constancy of the charge i»
due to some fundamental property of the ether. It seems probable that a com-
plete solution of the problem requires a complete theory of matter and electricity.

                         By J. E. Petavel.

Objects of the Eesetirch.--The primary object of the present research is to

extend the work originally done by Bunsen at atmospheric pressures to initial

pressures of one or two hundred atmospheres.

Both the maximum pressure of the explosion and the rate of change of the

Apressure are recorded.  long series of experiments, the result of which will

shortly be published, having proved the very high thermal conductivity of com-

pressed gases, it was important to obtain some further data with regard to the

thermal properties of gases at the highest temperatures and pressures. It is alsa
desirable that some further information with regard to the phenomena of dissocia-

tion at very high pressures should be obtained.
     Finally, it is hoped that, from a practical point of view, the results will be of

use as a contribution to the knowledge of thermodynamics.
     In all heat engines the efficiency is greatly increased by the use of a wicler

temperature interval and higher pressures. Whereas mechanical difficulties, which,
up to recently, had hindered progress in this direction, are gradually being over-

come, the theoretical side of the question has not received all the attention it

merits.

     The Apparatus.--In order to gain some information with regard to the effisct

of the surface of the enclosure, three distinct enclosures are used :

A1° spherical enclosure of 500 c.c. capacity (about 4 in. diameter).
A2° cyhndrical enclosure, 27 in. long, also of 500 c.c. capacity.

3° A spherical enclosure of about 10,000 c.c. capacity.

The first two enclosures are calculated to withstand pressures up to two thousand
atmospheres the third, pressures up to two hundred atmospheres.

                                                                       ;

     ' The experiments have been carried out at the Davy-Faraday Laboratory of the
Royal Institution. Part of the apparatus was provided by the Laboratory, the
remainder being purchased with the funds awarded for this purpose by the Govern-

ment Grant Committee of the Royal Society.
--656 REPORT 1900.

All experiments recorded in the present communication refer to the 500 c.c.

spherical enclosure.

   --The Pressure Gauges. Two distinct gauges are used. The first measures the

maximum pressure attained and in principle is similar to Bunsen's original
Aapparatus.
             piston lifts or does not lift according to -whether the explosive

pressure does or does not rise above the pressure corresponding to the weight with

which the piston is held down. In the present case, however, to diminish the

inertia of the system, the weights are replaced by a gaseous pressure acting on the
opposite end of the piston. The areas of the two piston heads being in the ratio of

50 to 1, an explosive pressure of 500 atmospheres is exactly balanced by a gaseous
pressure of 10 atmospheres acting on the other side of this equilibrium valve. To

render the action of the apparatus as rapid as possible, the travel of the piston is

limited by means of a micrometer screw to two or three thousandths of an inch.

The piston, on coming in contact with this micrometer screw, closes an electric
circuit communicating with an indicator. As an example of the method a series

of observations are given in the table.

      It is hoped, however, that before long a series of experiments will be completed
giving the necessary data for all mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen at all initial
pressures between one atmosphere and L'OO atmospheres.

                O71 the Relations of Radiation to Temperature,

                            By Dr. J. Larmok, F.R.S.

                                                                                                              .

     The key to this subject is the principle, arrived at independently by Balfour
Stewart and Kirchhofi' about the year 1857, that the constitution and intensity of

the steady radiation in an enclosure is determined by the temperature of the
surrounding bodies, and involves no other element. It was pointed out by
Stewart ' that if the enclosure contains a radiating and absorbing body which i?

put in motion, the temperature being uniform throughout, then the constitutions
of the radiation in front of it and behind it will differ on account of the Doppler

effect, so that there will be a chance of gaining mechanical work in the restoration

of a uniform state. There must thus be some kind of thermodynamic compensa-

tion, which might arise from fcthereal friction, or from work required to produce

the motion of the body against pressure excited by the surrounding radiation.

The hypothesis  of  friction  is  now  out  of court  in  idtimate  molecular                                    physics
                                                                                                                                                 ;

while the thermodynamic bearing of a pressure produced by radiation has been

developed by Bartoli and Boltzmann (1884), and that of the Doppler effect by

Wien (1893).
    Application of the Doppler Principle.--The procedure of Wien amounts to

isolating a region of radiation within a perfectly reflecting enclosure, and esti-

mating the average shortening of the constituent wave-lengths produced by a
very slow shrinkage of its volume. The argument is, however, much simplified

if the enclosure is taken to be spherical and to remain so ; for it may then be

easily shown that each individual undulation is shortened in the same ratio as is

the radius of the enclosure, so that the undulatory content remains similar to

itself, with uniformly shortened wave-lengths, whether it is uniformly distributed

as regards direction or not, and whatever its constitution may be. But if there is

a very small piece of a material radiator in the enclosure, the radiation initially

inside will have been reduced by its radiating and absorbing action to that cor-

responding to its temperature. In that case the shrinkage must retain it always,
at each stage of its transformation, in the constitution corresponding to some

temperature. Otherwise differences of temperature would be effectively esta-

blished between the various constituents of the radiation in the enclosure ; these

could be permanent in the absence of material bodies ; but if the latter are

present this would involve degradation of their energy, for which there is here no

room, because, on the principles of Stewart and Kirchhoff', the state corresponding

to given energy and volume and temperatiire is determinate. Thus we infer that

if the wave-lengths of the steady radiation corresponding to any one temperature

are all altered in the same ratio, we obtain a distribution which corresponds to

some other temperature in every respect except absolute intensities.

  --Direct Transformation of Mechanical Eiiergi/ into Radiationr There is one

point, however, that rewards examination. When undulations of any kind are

reflected from an advancing wall, there is slightly more energy in the reflected

    ' Brit. Assoc. Report, 1 871 ; cf. also Eiicycl. Brit., art. ' Eadiation ' (1 886), by Tait.
    = The present form of this argument arose out of some remarks contributed by
Professor FitzGerald, and by Mr. Alfred Walker of Bradford, to the discussion on
this paper. Mr. Walker points out that by reflecting the radiation from a hot body,
situated at the centre of a wheel, by a ring of oblique vanes around its circum-
ference, and then reversing its path by direct reflexion from a ring of fixed vanes

outside the wheel, so as to return it into the source, its pressure may be (theoretically)

utilised to drive the wheel, and in time to get up a high speed if tliere is no load
the thermodynamic compensation in this very interesting arrangement lies in the

lowering of the temperature of the part of the incident radiation that is not thus

utilised.

beam than tliere -was in tlie incident beam, altliougli its leugtli is shorter on

account of the Dopplev effect. This requires that the' undulations must oppose a

resistance to the advancing wall, and that the mechanical work required to push

on the wall is directly transformed into undulatory energfy. In fact, let us con-

sider the mechanism of the reflexion. Suppose the displacement in a directly
incident wave-train, with velocity of propagation c, to be ^ = a cos {mx - met) ; that
in the reflected train will be ^' = «'cos {}n'x + m'ci), where a', vi are deter-

termined by the condition that the total displacement is annulled at the advanc-

ing reflector, because no disturbance penetrates beyond it ; therefore when ,r= vt,-

mwhere v is its velocity, | + ^' = o. Thus we must have a = - a, and m' = ~^ ", in

                                                                                                               c+v
agreement with the usual statement of the Doppler effect when v is small compared

with c. Observe, in fact, that the direct and reflected wave-trains have a system

of nodes which travel with velocity v, and that the moving reflector coincides

Nowwith one of them.                                                                                                                 the velocities d^ldt and d^'jdf, in these two trains are not

equal. Their mean squares, on which the kinetic energy per unit length depends,

are as m^ to m'-. The potential energies per unit length depend on the means of

(d^ldx)'- and (d^'\dxY, and are of course in the same ratio. Thus the energies

per unit length in the direct and reflected trains are as m" to m'-, while the lengths

m mof the trains are as m' to ; hence their total energies are as                                                                                                                                       to 711' in other

words the reflected train has received an accretion of energy equal to 1 --7)i'jm of

the incident energy, which can only have come from mechanical work spent in push-

ing on the reflector with its velocity v. The opposing pressure is thus in numerical

reflected, that is in front of the reflector.

"When V is small compared with c, this agrees with Maxwell's law for the pressure

of radiation. This case is also theoretically interesting, because in the application

to ajther-waves | is the displacement of the njther elements whoso velocity d^jdt

represents the magnetic force ; so that here we have an actual case in which this

vector ^, hitherto introduced only in the tlieoretical dynamics of electron-tlieory,
is essential to a bare statement of the i'acts. Another remark here arises. It has

been held that a beam of light is an irreversible agent, because the radiant pres-

sure at the front of the beam has nothing to work an-ainst, and its worlc is there-
fore degraded. But suppose it had a reflector moving with its own velocity c to

work against ; our result shows that the pressure vanishes and no work is done.

Thus that objection to the thermodynamic treatment of a single ray is not well

founded.

This generalisation of the theory of radiant pressure to all kinds of undulatory

motion is based on the conserv.ation of the enei'gy. It remains to consider the

mechanical origin of the pressure. In the special case of an unlimited stretched

cord carrying transverse waves the advancing reflector may be a lamina, through

a small hole in which the cord passes without friction : the cord is straight on one

side of the lamina, and inclined on the other side on account of the vibration ; and
it is easil}"^ shown that the resultant of the tensions on the two sides provides a

force acting on the lamina which, when averaged, agrees with the general formula.

In the case of an extended medium with advancing transverse waves, which are

reflected directly, the origin of the pressure is not so obvious, because there is not

an obvious mechanism for a reflector which would sweep the waves in front of it

as it advances. In the rethereal ease we can, however, on the basis of electron-

theor}', imagine a constitution for a reflector which will turn back the radiation on

the same principle as a metallic mirror totally reflects Hertzian waves, and thus

obtain an idea of how the force acts.
     The case of direct incidence has here been treated for simplicity ; that of oblique

incidence easily follows                                                                                                             the  expression  for  tlie pressure is reduced in the ratio of

            As already explained, if tlie original state has the constitution as regards wave-

        lengths corresponding to a teniperature,T, the new state must correspond to some

       other temperature T -- ST. Thus we can gain work \>y absorbing the radiation

        into the working substance of a thermal engine at the one temperature, and extract-

       ing it at the other; as the process is reversible, we have by Carnot's principle

          radiation to the temperature.

             Moreover the Doppler principle has shown us that in the uniform shrinkage of
        a spherical enclosure the wave-lengths diminish as the linear dimensions, and

I therefore as Yi, or inversely as T by the above result. Thus in the radiations
         at different temperatures, if the scale of wave-length is reduced inversely as the
         temperature the curves of constitution of the radiation become homologous, i.e.,
         their ordinates are all in the same ratio. This is Wien's law.
             These relations show that the energy of the radiation corresponding to the
        temperature T, which lies between wave-lengtlis X and X + h\, is of the form
        X '"/(yV) 8X. The investigation, theoretical (Wien, Planck, Rayleigh, etc.) and
        experimental (Lummer and Pringsheim, Paschen, etc.) of the form of this function

        general theory of the relation of radiation to temperature. The theoretical
        relations on which this expression is founded have been shown to be in agreement
      ywith fact ; and it appears that the form c^e~''-'^'^ fairly represents (XT) over a wide
         range of temperature. These relations have been derived, as usual, from a
         dynamical discussion of the aggregate intensity of radiation belonging to the
       temperature ; it may be shown that the same results, but nothing in addition, will
         be gained by applying the same principles to each constituent of range SX by
        itself, assigning to each its own temperature.

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 7.

The Chairman delivered the following Address :

It has been decided to form a Department of Astronomy under Section A, and I

have been requested to give an Address on the occasion. In looking up the

records of the British Association to see what position Asutromimy has occupied, I

Awas delighted to fii d, in the very first volume, '  Pteport on" the I'rogres.s of

Astronomy during the Pre-eat Century,' made by the late Sir Geor-e Airy, so

660 HEPOUT-- 1900.

many yeara our Astronomer Royal, and at that time Plumiah Professor of

Astronomy at Cambridge. This report, made at the second meeting of the

Association, describes, in a most interesting manner, the progress that was made

during the first third of the century, and we can gather from it the state of

astronomical matters at that time. The thought naturally occurred to me to give

a report, on the same lines, to the end of this century, but a little consideration

showed that it was impossible in the limited time at my disposal to give more

than a bare outline ol' the progress made.

At the time this report was written we may say, in a general way, that the

astronomy of that day concerned itself witli tlie position of the heavenly bodies '

only, and, except for the greater precision of observation resulting from better

instruments and the larger number of observatories at work, this, the gravitational

side of astronomy, remains much as it was in Airy's time.

    What has been aptiy called the New or Physical Astronomy did not then

exist. I propose to briefly compare the state of things then existing with the

present state of the science, without dealing very particularly with the various

causes operating to produce the change ; to allude briefly to the new astronomy

and to speak rather fully about astronomical instruments generally, and of the

lines on which it is most probable future developments will be made.

In this report ' we find that at the beginning of the century the Greenwich

Observatory was the only one in which observations were made on a regular

system. The thirty-six stars selected by Dr. Maskelyne, aad the sun and moon,

were observed on the meridian with great regularity, the planets vei-y rarely and

only at particular parts of their orbits ; small stars, or stars not included in the
thirty-six, were seldom observed.

This state of aflairs was no doubt greatly improved at the epoch of the report,

but it contrasts strongly with the present work at Greenwich, where 5,000 stars

were observed in 1899, in addition to the aatrographic, spectroscopic, magnetic,

meteorological, and other work.

Many observatories, of great importance since, were about that time founded,

those at Cambridge, Cape of Good Hope, and Paramatta having just been started.

A list is given of the public observatories then existing, with the remark that the

author is ' unaware that there is any public observatory iu America, though there

are,' he says, ' some able observers.'

The progress made since then is truly remarkable. The first public observa-

tory in America was founded about the middle of the century, and n)w public

and private observatories number about 150, while the instrumental equipment ia
in many cases superior to that of any other country. The prophetic opinion of

Airy about American observers has been fully borne out. The discovery of two

satellites to Mars by Hall in 1S77, of a fifth satellite to Jupiter by Barnard iu

1892, and the discovery of Hyperion by Bond, simultaneously with Lassell, iu

1848, are notable achievements.

The enormous amount of work turned out by the Harvard Observatory and its

branches in South America, all the photographic and spectroscopic work carried

out by many difl'erent astronomers, and the new lines of research initiated show

Aan amount of enthusiasm not excelled by any other country.            greater portion

of the astronomical work iu America has been on the lines of the new astronomy,

but the old astronomy has not been at all neglected. In this branch pace has

been kept with other countries.

From this report we gath(>r that the mural quadrant at most of the observa-

tories v/as about to be replaced by the divided circle. Troughton had perfected a

method of dividing circles, which, as the author says, ' may be considered as
the greatest improvement ever made in the art of institiment making.'

    Two refractors of 11 and 12 inches aperture had just been imported into

this country; clockwork for driving had been applied to the Dorpat and Paris

e^uatorials, but the author had not seen either iu a state of action.

The m-thod of mounting iustrumeuta adopted by the Germans was rather

severely criticised by the author, tbe general principle of their mounting being

' telescopes are always supported at the middle, not at the ends.'

' Every part is, if possible, supported by counterpoises.'

          ' To these principles everything is sacrificed. For instance, in an equatorial

I the polar axis is to be supported in the middle by a counterpoise. This not only
     makes the instrument weak (as the axis must be single), but also introduces some

inconvenience into tbe use of it.  The telescope is on one side of  the axis                                          on  the
                                                                                                                   ;

Aother side is a counterpoise. Each end of the telescope has a counterpoise.

telescope thus mounted must, I should think, be very liable to tremor. If a

person who is no mechanic and who has not used one of these instruments may

presume to give an opinion, I should say that the Germans have made no im-

provement in instruments except in the excellence of the workmanship.'

1 have no doubt that this question had often occupied Airy's mind, for in the

Northumberland Equatorial Telescope which he designed shortly after for Cam-

bridge he adopted what has been called the English form of mounting, where the

telescope is supported by a pivot at each side, and a long polar axis is supported at

each eixi. This telescope is in working order at the present time at Cambridge.

    When he became Astronomer Royal he used the same design for what was for

many years the great equatorial at Greenwich, though tlie wooden uprights form-

ing the polar axis were in the Greenwich telescope replaced by iron. It says much

for the excellence of the design and workmanship of this mounting, designed as it

was for an object glass of about 13 inches diameter, when we find the present

Astronomer Royal, Mr. Christie, has used it to carry a telescope of 28 inches

aperture, and that it does this perfectly.

Notwithstanding the greater steadiness of the English form of mounting,

the German iorm has been adopted generally lor the mountiDg of the large

refractors recently made.

There is much interesting matter in this report of an historical character.

As I have already said, the new astronomy, as we know it, did not exist, but

in a report ' on optics, in the same volume, by Sir David Brewster, we find that

spectrum analysis was then occupying attention, and the last paragraph of this

report is well worth quoting : ' But whatever hypothesis be destined to embrace

and explain this class of phenomena, the fact which I have mentioned opens an

extensive field of inquiry. By the aid of the gaseous absorbent we may study

with the minutest accuracy the action of the elements of material bodies in all

their variety of combinations, upon definite and easily recognised rays of light,

and we may discover curious analogies between their affinities and those which

produce the fixed lines in the spectra of the stars. The apparatus, however, which

is requisite to carry on such inquiries with success cannot be procured by indivi-

duals, and cannot even be used in ordinary apartments. Leases of large diameter,

accurate heliostats, and telescopes of large aperture are absolutely neces.sary for

this purpose ; but with such auxiliaries it would be easy to construct optical com-

binations, by which the defective rays in the spectra of all the fixed stars down to

the tenth magnitude might be observed, and by which we might study the effects

of the very combustion which lights up the suns of other systems.'

Brewster's words are almost prophetic, and it Avould almost appear as if he

unk-nowingly held the key to the elucidation of the spectrum lines, for it was not

until 1859 that KirchhoH''s discovery of the true origin of the dark lines was made.

Frauiihofer was the first to observe the spectra of the planets and the stars, and

to notice the different types of stellar spectra. In 1817 he recorded the spectrum

of Venus and Sirius, Hud later, in 1828, he described the spectrum of Mars; also

Castor, Pollux, Capella, Betelgeux, and Procyon.

     Fraunhofer, Lament, Donati, Brewster, Stokes, Gladstone, and others
carried on their researches at a time when the principles of spectrum analysis
were unknown, but immediately upon Kirchhofl"s discovery great interest was
awakened.

     With spectrum analysis thus established, aided as it was later by the greater
development of photography, tht new astronomy was firmly established,

662 REPOKT--1900.

     The memorable results arrived at by Kircbhoff were no sooner publisbed than
they were accepted without dissent. The woiiis of Stokes, Foucault,and Angstrom
at that period were all suggestive of the truth, but do not mark an epoch of

discovery.

     Astronomical spectroscopy divided itself naturally into two main branches, the
one of the sun, the other of the stars, each having its many offshoots. I shall just
mention a few points relating to each. The dark lines in- the solar spectrum had

already been mapped by Fraunhofer, and now it only needed better instruments

and the application of laboratory spectra with KirchhofTs principle to advance this
work still further.

     Fraunhofer had already pointed out the way in using gratings, and these were

further improved by Nobert and Rutherfurd.

    Kirchhoff's Map of the Solar Spectrum, published in 1861-62, was the most

complete up to that time but the scale of reference adopted by him was^an arbi-
                                                                                                                                            ;

trary one, so that it was not long before this was improved upon. Angstrom
published in 1868 his map of the 'Normal Solar Spectrum,' adopting the natural
scale of wave-lengths for reference, and this remained in use until quite recent

times.

     The increased accuracy in the ruling of gratings by Rutherfurd materially im-
proved the efficiency of the solar spectroscope, but it was not uutil Professor
Rowland's invention of the concave grating that this work gained any decisive
impetus. The maps (ffrst published in 1885) and tables (publisbed in the years
1896-98) of the lines of the solar spectrum are now almost universally accepted
and adopted as a standard of reference. These tables alone record about 10,000
lines in the spectrum of the sun, wliich is in marked contrast to the number 7
recorded by Wollaston at the beginning of the century (1802). Good work in the

mproduction of maps has also been done this country by Iliggs.

     Michelson has also recently invented a new form of spectroscope called the
' Echelon,' ^ in which a grating with a relatively small number of lines is employed,
the dispersion necessary for modern work being obtained by using a high order
(say the hundredth) into which most of the light has been concentrated.

      Besides lines recorded in the visual and ultra-violet portions of the solar spec-
trum, maps have been made of the lines in the infra-red, the most important being
that of Langley's, published in 1894, prepared by the use of his ' bolometer.'

Good work had, however, been done in this direction previously by Becquerel,
Lamansky, and Abney ; the last, indeed, succeeded even in photographing a part

 of it.

     The recording of the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum is not all, however.
The application of the spectroscope to the sun has several epoch-marking events
attached to it, notablj' those of proving the solar character of the prominences and
corona, the rendering visible of the prominences without the aid of an eclipse by
the discovery of Lockyer and Jansseu in 18G8, the photography of the prominences
both round the limb and those projected on the solar disc hj the invention of the
spectro- heliograph by Hale and Deslandres in 1890.

     Success has not yet favoured the many attempts to photograph the corona
without an eclipse by spectroscopic means ; but even now this problem is being
attacked by Deslandres with the employment of the calorific rays.

     Spectroscopic work on the sun has led to the discovery of many hundreds of

 dark lines, the counterparts of which it has not yet been possible to produce on the

 earth.

      But besides those ruiknown substances which reveal their presence by dark
lines, there were two others discovered, which showed themselves only by bright
 lines, the one in the chromosphere, to which the name of Helium was given, and
 the other in the corona, to which the name of Coronium was applied.

     The former was, however, identified terrestrially by Ramsay in 1895, though
 the latter is .still undetermined. The revision of its wave-length, brought about
 by the observations of the eclipse of 1898, may, however, result in this element
 being transferred from the unknown to the known in the near future,

     Tlie study of stellar spectra was taken up by Huggins, Rutherfurd, and Secchi.
Kutherfurd ^ published in 1862 bis results upon a number of stars, and suggested
 a rough classification of tbe white and yellow stars ; but Secchi deserves the high

 credit of introducing the first systematic differentiation of the stars according to
their spectra, he having begun a spectroscopic survey of the heavens for the purposes

of classification,'- whilst Huggins devoted himself to the thorough analysis of the
spectra of a few stars.

     The introductinn of photography marks another epoch in the study of stellar
spectra. Sir William ituggins applied photograpliy as early as 1863,^ and secured
an impression of the spectrum of Sirius, but nearly another decade elapsed before

Professor If. Draper'* took a photograph of the spectrum of Vega in 1872, which
was the first to record any lines. With the introduction of dry plates this branch
of the new astronomy received another impetus, and the catalogues of stellar

spectra have now become numerous. Among them may be mentioned those of

Harvard College, Potsdam, Lockyer, McClean, and Huggins. The Draper
Catalogue ^ of the Harvard College, which is a spectroscopic Durchmusterung,
alone contains the spectra of 10,351 stars down to the 7-8 magnitudes, and this has
further been extended by work at Arequipa, whilst Vogel andMiiller of Potsdam"
made a spectroscopic survey of the stars down to tho 7"5 magnitude between --1°
and + 20° declination. This has again been supplemented by Scheiner" ('Unter-
suchungen fiber die Spectra der helleren Sterne '), and by Vogel and "Wilsing *
('Untersuchungen fiber die Spectra von 528 Sternen '). Lockyer'' in 1892 published

a series of large-scale photographs of the brighter stars, and more recently
McClean '" has completed a spectroscopic survey of the stars of both hemispheres

down to the 3^ magnitude. For the study and investigation of special types of
stars, the researches of Dun^r on the red stars made at Upsala, and those
of Keeler and Campbell on the bright fine stars made at the Lick Observatory,
deserve mention. For the study of stellar spectra the use of prisms in slit or
objective prism spectroscopes has predominated, though more recently the use of

specially ruled gratings has been attended by some degree of success at the Yerkes

Observatory.

     Several new stars have also been discovered by their spectra by Pickering in
his routine work of charting the spectra of the stars in different portions of the
skj-. The photographic plate containing their peculiar spectra was, however, not
examined in many cases until the star had died down again.

     Spectrum analysis also opened up another field of inquiry, viz., that of the
motion of the stars in the line of sight, based on the process of reasoning due to
Doppler, and accordingly named Doppler's Pri)icip]e."

     The observatories of Greenwich and Potsdam were among the first to apply
this to the stars, and more recently Campbell at Lick, Newall at Cambridge, and
Belopolsky at Pulkowa have made use of the same principle with enormous

success.

     It was also discovered that there are certain classes of stars having a large
componeut velocity in the line of sight, which changes its direction from time to
time, and in manv such cases orbital motion has been proven, as in the case of

Algol.

     Another class of binary stars has also been discovered spectroscopically and
explained by Doppler's principle. I refer to the stars known as spectroscopic
binaries, in which the spectrum lines of one luminous source reciprocate over those

from tlie other source of light, according as one is moving towards or away from

the earth. This displacement of the spectrum lines led to the discovery of the

duplicity of /3 Aurigae, and ( Urssc Majoris by Pickering.'

Several other such stars have now been detected, notably /3 Lyrse, and

lastly Capella, discovered independently by Campbell - at Lick, and Newall ^ at

Cambridge.

The progress of the new astronomy is so closely bound up with that of photo-

graphy that I shall briefly call to mind some of the many achievements in which

photography has aided the astronomer.

      Daguerre's invention in 1839 was almost immediately tried with the sun and

' moon, J. W. Draper and the two Bonds in America, Warren de la Rue in this

country, and Foucault and Fizeau in France, being among the pioneers of celestial

photography                                                      but no real progress seems to have been made until  after  the intro-
                                                              ;

duction of the collodion process. Sir John Herschel in 1847 suggested the daily

self-registration of the sun-spots to supersede drawings ; and in 1857 the De la Rue

photo-heliograph was installed at Kew. From 1858-72 a daily record was main-

tained by the Kew photo-heliograph, when the work was discontinued. Since
1873 the Kew series has been continued at Greenwich, which is supplemented by

pictures from Dehra Diin in India and from Mauritius. The standard size of the

sun's disc on these photographs has now been for many years 8 inches, though for

some time a 12-inch series was kept up.

     The first recorded endeavour to employ photography for eclipse work dates back
to 1851, when Berowsky obtained a daguerreotype of the solar prominences during

the total eclipse. From that date nearly every . total eclipse of the sun has been

studied by the aid of photography.

In 1860 the first regularly planned attack on the problem by means of photo-

graphy was made, when De la Rue and Secchi successfully photogi'aphed the pro-

minences and traces of the corona, but it was not until 1869 that Professor Stephen

Alexander obtained the first good photograph of the corona.

In recent years, from 1893 up to the total eclipse which occurred last May,

photography has been employed to secure large-scale pictures of the corona.

These were inaugurated in 1893 by Professor Schaeberle, who secured a 4-inch

picture of the eclipsed sun in Chili: these have been exceeded by Professor Langley,

who obtained a 15-inch picture of the corona in North Carolina during the eclipse
of May 1900.

Photography also supplied the key to the question of the prominences and

corona being solar appendages, for pictures of the eclipse sun taken in Spain in 1860

terminated this dispute with regard to the prominences, and finally to the corona in

     In 1876, in addition to photographing the corona, attempts were made to
photograph its spectrum, and at every eclipse since then the sensitised plate has
been used to record both the spectrum of the chromosphere and the corona. The
spectrum of the lower layers of the chromosphere was first successfully photo-
graphed during the total eclipse of 1896 in Nova ZemblabyMr. Shackletoii, though
seen by Young as early as 1870, and a new value was given to the wave-length of
the coronal line (wrongly mapped by Young in 1 869) from photographs taken by
Mr. Fowler during the eclipse of 1898 (India).

     Lunar pliotogTaphy has occupied the attention of various physicists from time
to time, and when Daguerre's process was first enunciated, Arago proposed that
the lunar surface should be studied by means of the photographically produced
images. In 1840 Dr. Draper succeeded in impressing a daguerreotype plate with a
lunar image by the aid of a 5-inch refractor. The earliest lunar photographs, how-
ever, shown in England were due to Professor Bond, of the United States. These
he exhibited at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Dancer, the optician, of Manchester,
was perhaps the first Englishman who secured lunar images, but they were of

small size.*

    Another skilful observer was Crookes, who obtained images of 2 inches

diameter with an 8-inch refractor of the Liverpool Ohservatory. In 1852 De la

Eue began experimenting in lunar photography. He employed a reflector of some

A10 feet focal length and about 13 inches diameter.                  very complete account of

hh methods is given in a paper read before the British Association. Mr. Ruther-

furd at a later date having tried an IH-inch refractor, and also a 13-inch reflector,

finally constructed a photographic refracting telescope, and produced some of the

finest pictures of the moon that were ever taken until recent years. Also Henry

Draper's picture of the moon taken September 3, 1863, remained unsurpassed for

a quarter of a century.

Admirable photographs of the lunar surface have been published in recent years

by the Lick Olaservatory and others. T myself devoted considerable attention to

this subject at one time. Photographs surpassing anything before attempted were

published in 1896-99 by MM. Loewy and Puiseux, taken with the Equatorial

Coude of the Paris Observatory.

Star prints were first secured at Harvard College, under the direction of W. 0.

Bond, in 1850                                                        and his son, G. P. Bond, made in 1857 a most promising start with
                                                                  ;

double-star measurements on sensitive plates, his subject being the well-known

pair in the tail of the Great Bear. The competence of the photographic method to

meet the stringent requirements of exact astronomy was still more decisively

shown in 1866 by Dr. Gould's determination from his plates of nearly fifty stars

in the Pleiades. Their comparison with Bessel's places for tlie same objects

proved that the lapse of a score of years had made no difl'erence in the configura-

· tion of tliat immemorial cluster ; and Professor Jacoby's recent measures of

Eutherfurd's photographs taken in 1872 and 1874 enforce the same conclusion.

The above facts are so forcible that no wonder that at the Astrophotographic

Congress held in Paris in 1887 it was decided to make a photographic survey of
the heavens, and now eighteen photographic telescopes of 13 inches aperture are in

operation in various parts of world, for the purpose of preparing the international

astrographic chart, and it was hoped that the catalogue plates would be completed

by 1900.

Photography has been applied so assiduously to the discovery of minor planets

that something like 450 are now known, the most noteworthy, perhaps, as

regards utility being the discovery of Eros (433) in 1898 by Herr "Witt at the

Observatory Urania, near Berlin.

AVith regard to the application of photography to recording the form of various

nebulae, it is interesting to quote a passage from Dick's 'Practical Astronomer,'

published in 1845, as opposed to Herschel's opinion that the photography of a

nebula would never be impossible.

' It might, perhaps, be considered as beyond the bounds of probability to expect

that even the distant nebulas might thus be fixed, and a delineation of their objects

produced, which shall be capable of being magnified by microscopes. But we

ought to consider that the art is only in its infancy, and that plates of a more

delicate nature than those hitherto used may yet be prepared, and that other

properties of light may yet be discovered, which shall facilitate such designs. For
we ought now to set no boundaries to the discoveries of science, and to the

practical applications of scientific discovery, which genius and art may accomplish.'

It was not, however, until 1880 that Draper first photographed the Orion

Nebula, and later by three years I succeeded in doing the same thing with an

exposure of only thirty-seven minutes. In December 1885 the brothers Henry by

the aid of photography found that the Pleiades were involved in a nebula, part of

which, however, had been seen by myself ' with my 3-foot reflector in February

1880, and later, February 1886, it was also partly discerned at Pulkowa with

the 30-inch refractor then newly erected.

Still more nebulosity was shown b\ Dr. Eoberts's photograph s,'-' taken with his

20-inch reflector in October and December 1886, when the whole western side of the

group was shown to be involved in a vast nebula, whilst a later photograph taken

by MM. Henry early in 1888 showed that practically the whole of the group was

a shoal of nebulous matter.

result from Comet Wells.-

      I propose to consider the question of the telescope on the following lines

(1) The refractor and reflector from their ince]>tion to their present state. (2) The
various modifications and improvements that have been made in mounting these
instruments, and (3) the instrument that has been lately introduced by a com-
bination of the two, refractor and reflector, a striking example of which exists now

at the Paris Exhibition.

    At a meeting of the British Association held nearly half a century ago (1852)

(Belfast) Sir David Brewster showed a plate of rock crystal worked in the form
of a lens whicli had been recently found in Isineveh. Sir David Brewster asserted
that this lens had been destined for optical purposes, and that it never was a dress

ornament.
     That the ancients were acquainted with the powers of a magnifying lens

maybe inferrerl from the delicacy and minuteness of the incised work on their

seals and intaglios, which could only have been done by an eye aided by a lens of

some sort.
     There is,' however, no direct evidence that the ancients were really acquainted

with the refracting telescope, though Aristotle speaks of the tubes through which
the ancients observed distant objects, and compares their efl'ect to that of a well

from the bottom of which the stars may be seen in daylight.^ As an historical fact

without any equivocations, however, there is no serious doubt that the telescope

was invented in Holland.
     The honour of being the originator has been claimed for three men, each of

whom has had his partisans. Their names are Metius, Lippershey, and Janssen.

     Galileo himself says that it was through hearing that some one in Fr.mce or
Holland had made an'instrument which magnified distant objects that he was led

to inquire how such a result could be obtained.
     The first publisher of a result or discovery, supposing such discovery to be

honestly bis own, ranks as the first inventor, and there is little doubt that Galileo

was the first to show the world how to make a tele.scope.'* His fir.st telescope was
made whilst on a visit to Venice, and he there exhibited a telescope viafpufi/ing
three times: this was in May ] GOO. Later telescopes which emanated from the

hands of Galileo magnified successively four, seven, and thirty times. This latter

number he never exceeded.
     Greater magnifying power was not attained until Kepler explained the theory

and some of the advantages of a telescope made of two convex lenses in his
 Catoptrics {IQW). The first person to actually apply this to the telescope was
Father Scheiner, who describes it in his Bosa Ursina (1630), and^Vm. Gascoigne
was the first to appreciate practically the chief advantages by his invciition of the

micrometer and application of telescopic sights to in>trumeiits of precision.
      It was, however, not until about the middle of the seventeenth .entury that

Kepler's telescope came to be neaily universal, and tlien chiefly because its field

of view exceeded that of the Galilean.

     The first powerful telescopes were made by Iluyghens, and with one of these

Le discovered Titan (Saturn's brightest satellite) :" his telescopes magnified from
fortv-eight to ninety-two times, were about 2^ inches aperture, with focal lengths

ranging from 12 to 23 feet. By tlie aid of these he gave the first explanation of

Saturn's ring, which be published in 1659.
      Huyghens also states that be made object-glasses of 170 feet and 210 feet focal

length also one 300 feet long, but which magnified only 000 times ; he ako

    Auzout states that the best telescopes of Campani at Rome magnified
150 times, and were of 17 feet focal length. He himself is said to have made

telescopes of from 300 to COO feet focus, but it is improbable that they were ever
put to practical use. Ca?sini discovered Snturn's fifth satellite (Rhea) in 1672,
·with a telescope made by Campani, magnifying about 150 times, whilst later, iu
1684, he added the third and fourth satellites of the same planet to the list of his

discoveries.

      Although these telescopes were unwieldy, Bradley, with his usual persistency,
actually determined the diameter of Venus iu 1722 with a telescope of 212 feet

focal length.

     AVith such cumbersome instruments many devices were invented of pointing
these mrial telescojies, as they were termed, to various parts of the sky. Huyghens
contrived some ingenious arrangements for this purpose, and also for adjusting and
centreing the eyepiece, the object-glass and eyepiece being connected by a long

braced rod.

      It was not, however, until DoUond's invention of the achromatic object-glass
in 1757-58 that the refracting telescope was materially inqjroved, and even then

 tlie difficulty of obtaining large blocks of glass free from striaa limited the telescope

as regards aperture, for even at the date of Airy's report we have seen that
12 inches was about the maximum aperture for an object-glass.

     The work of improving glass dates back to 1784, when Guiuand began

 e:^perimenting with the manufacture of optical flint glass.

     He conveyed his secrets to the firm of Fraunhofer and Utzschneider, whom he

joined in 1805, and during the period he was there they made the O'G inches

object-glass for the Dorpat telescope.
      Merz and Miidler, the successors of Fraimhorer, carried out successfally the

methods handed down to them by Gulnand and Fraunhofer.
      Guinand communicated his secrets to his family before his death in 182-3, and

they entered into partnership with Bontemps. the latter afterwards joined the
firm of Chance Bros., of Birmingham, and so some of Guinand's work came to

 England.

     At the present day MM. Feil, of Paris, who are direct descendants of

 Guinand and Messrs. Chance Bros., of Birmingham, are the best known manu-

 facturers of large discs of optical glass.

      It is related in history that Ptolemy Euergetes had caused to be erected on a

 lighthouse at Alexandria a piece of apparatus for discovering vessels a long way

 off; it has also been maintained that the instrument cited was a concave reflecting
 mirror, and it is possible to observe with the naked eye images formed by a

 concave mirror, and that such images are very bright.

      Also the Romans were well acquainted with the concentrating power of con-
 cave mirrors, using them as burning mirrors, as they were called. The first

 application of an eye lens to the image formed by reflection from a concave mirror

 appears to have been made by Father Zucchi, an Italian .Jesuit. Ilis work was

 published in 1652, though it appears lie employed such an instrument as early as

 1616. The priority, however, of describing, if not making, a practical reflecting
 telescope belongs to Gregory, who, in his ' Optica Promota,' 1663, discusses the

 forms of images of objects produced by mirrors. He was well aware of the

 failure of all attempts to perfect telescopes by using lenses of various curvature,
 and proposed the form of reflecting telescope which bears his name.

       Newton, however, was the first to construct a reflecting telescope, and with it
 he could see Jupiter's satellites, &c. Encouraged by this he made another of
 6^ inches focal length, which magnified thirty-eight times, and this he presented
 to the Royal Society on the day of his election to the Society iu 1671.

      To Newton we owe also the idea of employing pitch, used in the working of

  the surfaces.

    A third form of telescope was invented by Cassegrain in 1672. He substituted

  a small convex mirror for the concave mirror in Gregory's form, and thus rendered

  the telescope a little shorter.

       Short also, from 1730-1768, displayed uucommon ability iu the manufacture of
                                                                                     ;

reflecting telescopes, and succeeded in giving true paracolic and elliptic figures to

his specula, besides obtaining a bigh degree of polisli upon them. In Short's first

telescopes the specula were of glas-s, as suggested by Gregory, but it was not until

after Liebig's discovery of the process of depositing a film of metallic silver upon

a glass surface from a salt in solution that glass specula became almost universal,

and thus replaced the metallic ones of earlier times. '

   --Shortly after the announcement of Liebig's discovery Steinheil ' and later,

--independently, Foucault - proposed to employ glass i'or the specula of tele-
scopes, and, as is well known, this is done in all the large reflectors of to-day.

I now propose to deal with the various steps in the development of the

telescope, which have resulted in the three forms that I take as examples of the

highest development at the present time. These are the Yerkes telescope at

Chicago, my own 5-foot reflector, and the telescope recently erected at the Paris

Exhibition, dealing not only with the mountings, but with the principles of con-

struction of each. When the telescope was first used all could be seen by holding

it in the hand. As the magnifying power increased some kind of support would

become absolutely necessary, and this would take the form of the altitude and

azimuth stand, and the motion of the heavenly bodies would doubtless sug-gest the

parallactic or equatorial movement, by which the telescope followed the object

by one movement of an axis placed parallel to the pole. This did not come,

however, immediately. The long-focus telescopes of which I have spoken were

sometimes used with a tube, but more often the object-glass was mounted iu a

long cell and suspended from the top of a pole, at the right height to be in a line

between the observer and the object to be looked at ; and it was so arranged that

by means of a cord it could be brought into a fairly correct position. Notwith-

standing the extreme awkwardness of this arrangement most excellent observations

were made in the seventeenth century by the users of these telescopes. Then the

achromatic telescope was invented and mechanical mountings were used, with

circles for finding positions, much as we have them now. I have already mentioned

the rivalry between the English and German forms of mountings, and Airy's

preference for the English form. The general feeling amongst astronomers has,

however, been largely in favour of the German mounting for refractors, due, no

Wedoubt, to a great extent, to the enormous advance in engineering skill.  have

Amany examples of this form of mounting.  list of the principal large refracting

and reflecting telescopes now existing is given at the end of this Address. All the

refractors in this list, with the exception cf the Paris telescope of 50 inches, and

the Greenwich telescope of 28 inches, are mounted on the German form. Some

of these carry a reflector as well as, for instance, the telescope lately presented

to the Greenwich Observatory by Sir Henry Thompson, which, in addition to a

26-inch refractor, carries a 30-inch reflector at the other end of the declination

axis, such as had been previously used by Sir W^illiam Huggins and Dr. Roberts

the last, and perhaps the finest, example of the German form being the Yerkes

telescope at Chicago.

    The small reflector made by Sir Isaac Newton, probably the first ever made,
and now at the Royal Society, is mounted on a ball, gripped by two curved

pieces, attached to the body of the telescope, which allows the telescope to be

Wepointed in any direction.  have not much information as to the mounting of

early reflectors. Sir AVilliam Ilerschel mounted his 4-foot telescope on a rough

but admirably planned open-work mounting, capable of being turned round, and

with means to tilt the telescope to any required angle. This form was not very

suitable for picking up objects or determining their position, except indirectly ; but

for the way it was used by Sir William Herschel it was most admirably adapted:

the telescope being elevated to the required angle, it was left in that position, and

became practically a transit instrument. All the objects passing through the field

of view (which was of considerable extent, as the eyepiece could be moved in

declination) were observed, and their places in time and declination noted, so that

the positions of all these objects in the zone observed were obtained with a

considerable degree of accuracy. It was on this plan that Sir John Herschel made

his general catalogue of nebulae, embracing all the nebulaj he could see in both

hemispheres ; a complete work by one man that is almost unique in the history of

astronomy.

Sir William Herschel's mounting of his 4-foot reflector differs in almost every

particular from the mountings of the long-focus telescopes we have just spoken of.

The object-glass was at a height, the reflector was close to the ground. There was

a tube to o.ne telescope, but not to the other. The observer in one case stood on

the ground, in the other he was on a stage at a considerable elevation. One pole

sufficed with a cord for one ; a whole mass of poles, wheels, pulleys, and ropes sur-

--rounded the other. In one respect only were they alike they both did fine work.

Lassell seems to have been the first to mount a reflector equatorially. He,

like Herschel, made a 4-foot telescope, which he mounted in this way. Lord

Rosse mounted his telescopes somewhat after the manner of Sir William Herschel.

The present Earl has mounted a 3-foot equatorially.

A 4-foot telescope was made by Thomas Grubb for Melbourne, and this he

mounted on the German plan. The telescope being a Cassegrajn, the observer is

Apractically on the ground level.  somewhat similar instrument exists at the

Paris Observatory. Lassell'.^ 4-foot was mounted in what is called a fork mounting,

as is also my own 5-foot reflector, and this in some ways seems well adapted for

reflectors of the Newtonian kind.

   We now come to the Paris telescope. This is really the result of the combina-

tion of a reflector and a refractor. 1 cannot say when a plane mirror was first

used to direct the light into a telescope for astronomical purposes. It seems first

to have been suggested by Hooke, who, at a meeting of the Royal Society,

when the difficulty of mounting the long-focus lenses of Huyghens was under

discussion, pointed out that all difficulties would be done away with if, instead of

giving movement to the huge telescope itself, a plane mirror were made to move

in front of it.^

The Earl of Crawford, then Lord Lindsay, used a heliostat to direct the rays

from the sun, on the occasion of the transit of Venus, through a lens of 40 feet

focal length, in order to obtain photographs, and it was also largely used by the

American observers on the same occasion.

Monsieur Loewy at Paris proposed in 1871 a most ingenious telescope made by

a combination of two plane mirrors and an achromatic object-glass, which he calls

a Coude telescope, which has some most important advantages. Chief amongst

these are that the observer sits in perfect comfort at the upper end of the polar

axis, whence he need not move, and by suitable arrangements he can direct the
telescope to any part of the visible heavens. Several have been made in France,

including a large one of 24 inches aperture, erected at the Paris Observatory, and

which has already made its mark by the production of perhaps the best photog^raphs

of the moon yet obtained. I have already spoken of Lord Lindsay and his 40-foot

telescope, fed, as it were, with light from a heliostat. This is exactly the

plan that has been followed in the design of the large telescope in the Paris

Exhibition. Rutin place of a lens of 4 inches aperture and a heliostat a few inches

larger, the Paris telescope has a plane mirror of 6 feet and a lens exceeding

4 feet in diameter, with a focal length of 186 feet. The cost of a mounting on the

German plan and of a dome to shelter such an instrument would have been

enormous. The form chosen is at once the best and cheapest. One of the

great disadvantages is that from the nature of things it cannot take in the

whole of the heavens. The heliostat form of mounting of the plane mirror causes
a rotation of the image in the field of view which in many lines of research is a
strong objection. There is much to be said on the other side. The dome is

dispensed with ; the tube, the equatoi'ial mounting, and the rising floor are not
wanted. The m-'chanical arrangements of importance are contined to the

mounting of the necessary machinery to carry the large plane mirror and move

it round at the proper rate. The telescope need not have any tube (that to

important than all, the observer sits at his ease in the dark chamber. This

question of the observer, and the conditions under which he observes, is a most

important one as regards both the quality and quantity of the work done.

"\Ve have watched the astronomer, first observing from the floor level, then

mounted on a high scaffold like Sir William Herschel, Lassell, and Lord llosse

then  starting  again from the floor level and using  the early achromatic telescope
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

then, as these grew in size, climbing up on observing chairs to suit the various

positions of the eye end of the telescope, as we see in Mr. Newall's great telescope ;
then brought to the floor again by that excellent device of Sir Howard Grubb,

the rising floor. This is in use with the Lick and the Yerkes telescopes, where

the observer is practically always on the floor level, though constant attention is

needed, and the circular motion has to be provided ibr by constant movement, to

say nothing of the danger of the floor going wrong. Then we have the ideal

condition, as in the Equ.atorial Coude at the Paris Observatory, where the observer

sits comfortably sheltered and looks down the telescope, and from this position

can survey the whole of the visible heavens. The comfort of the observer is a

most important matter, especially for the long exposures that are given to photo-

graphic plates, as well as for continued visual work. In such a form of telescope

as that at Paris the lieliostat form of mounting the plane mirror is most suitable,

notwithstanding the rotation of the image. But there is another way in which

a plane mirror can be mounted, namely, on the plan first proposed by Auguste

many years ago, and lately brought forward again by Mods. Lippmann, of Paris, and

that is by simply mounting the plane mirror on a polar axis and parallel therewith,

and causing this mirror to rotate at half the speed of the earth's rotation. Any

part of the heavens seen by any person reflected from this mirror will appear to

be flxed in space, and not partake of the apparent movement of the earth, so long
Aas the mirror is kept moving at this rate.
                                             telescope, therefore, directed to such

a mirror can observe any heavenly body as if it were in an absolutely fixed position

so long as the angle of the mirror shall not be such as to make the reflected beam

less than will fill the oliject-glass. There is one disadvantage in the ccelostat, as

this instrument is called, and that is its suitability only for regions near the

equator. The range above and below, however, is large enough to include the

greater portion of the heavens, and that portion in which the solar system is

included. Here the telescope must be moved in azimuth for diH'erent portions of

the sky, as is fully explained by Professor Turner in vol. Ivi. of the ' Monthly Notices,'

and it therefore becomes necessary to provide for moving the telescope in azimuth

from time to time as ditierent zones above or below the equator are observed.

JSTo instrument yet devised is suitable for all kinds of work, but this form, not-

withstanding its defects, has so many and such important advantages that I

think it will obviate the necessity of building any larger refractors on the usual

models. The cost of producing a telescope much larger than the Yerkes on that

model, in comparison with what could he done on the plan I now advocate, renders
it most improbable that further money will be spent in that way. It may be

asked, What are the lines of research which could be taken up by a telescope of

this construction, and on what lines should the telescope be built ? I will endeavour

to answer this. All the work that is usually done by an astronomical telescope,

excepting very long-continued observations, can be equally well done by the fixed

telescope. But there are some special lines for which this form of research is

admirably suited, such as photographs of the moon, which would be possible with

a reflecting mirror of, say, 200 feet focal length, giving an image of some 2 feet

diameter in a primary I'ocus, or a larger image might be obtained either by a longer-

focus mirror or by a combination. It might even be worth while to build

a special coelostat for lunar photography, provided with an adjustment to the

polar axis and a method of regulating the rate of clock to correct the irregular

motion of the moon, and thus obtain absolutely fixed images on the photographic

plate.

    The advantage of large primary images in photography is low fully recog-

nised. For all other kinds of astronomical pliotograpliy a fixed telescope is
admirably adapted; and so with all spectroscopic investigations, a little con-
sideration will show that the conditions under which these investigations can lie

pursued are almost ideal. As to the actual form such a construction would take,

we can easily imagine it. The large mirror mounted as a coelostat in the centre

circular tracts round this centre, on which a fan-shaped house can be travelled

round to any azimuth, containing all the necessary apparatus for utilising the
light from the large plane mirror, so as to he easily moved round to the required

position in azimuth for observation. In place of a fan-shaped house movable

round the plane mirror, a permanent house might encircle the greater portion

round the mirror, and in this house the telescope or whatever optical combination

is used might be arranged on an open framework, supported on similar rails, so
as to run round to any azimuth required. The simplicity of the arrangement

and the enormous saving in cost would allow in any well-equipped observatory

the use of a special instrument for special work. The French telescope has a

mirror about G feet in diameter and a lens of about 4 feet. This is a great step

in advance over the Yerkes telescope, and it may be some time before the glass

for a lens greater than 50 inches diameter will be made, as the difficulty in making

optical glass is undoubtedly very great. Bat with the plane mirror there will ba

no such difficulty, as 6 feet  has already been made                                                                                                            and  so with a concave mirror
                                                                                                                                                             ;

there would be little difficulty in beginning with 6 feet or 7 feet. The way in

which the mirror would be used, always hanging in a band, is the most favour-

able condition ibr good work, and the absence of motion during an observation,

except of course that of the plane mirror (which could be given by floiiting the

polar axis and suitable mechanical arrangements, a motion of almost perfect

regularity).

     One extremely important thing in using silver or glass mirrors is the matter

of resilvering from time to time. Up to quite recently the silvering of mj' 5-foot
mirror was a long, imcertain, and expensive process. Now we have a method of

silvering mirrors that is certain, quick, and cheap. This takes away the cue great

disability from the silver or glass reflecting telescope, as the surface of silver

can now be renewed with greater ease and in less time than the lenses of a large
refracting telescope could be taken out and cleaned. It may be that we shall

revert to speculum metal for our mirrors, or use some other deposited metal on

glass ; but even as it is we have the silvered glass reflector, which at once allows
an enormous advance in power. To do justice to any large telescope it should

be erected in a position, as regards climate, where the conditions are as favour-

able as possible.

    The invention of the telescopa is to me the most beautiful ever made. Famili-
arity both in making and in using has only increased my admiration. With the

exception of the microphone of the late Professor Hughes, which enabled one to

hear otherwise inaudible sounds, sight is the only sense that we have been able to

enormously increase in range. The telescope enables one to see distant objects as if

they were at, say, one five-thousandth part of their distance, whilst the microscope

renders visible objects so small as to be almost incredible. In order to appreciate

better what optical aid does for the sense of sight, we can imagine the size of an eye,
and therefore of a man, capable of seeing in a natural way what the ordinary eye
sees by the aid of a large telescope, and, on the other hand, the size of a man and
his eye that could see plainly small objects as we see them under a powerful micro-
scope. The man in the first case would be several miles in height, and in the

latter he would not exceed a very small fraction of an inch in height.

    Photography also comes in as a further aid to the telescope, as it may possibly

be to the microscope. For a certain amount of light is necessary to produce sen-

sation in the eye. If this light is iusulKcient nothing is seen ; but owin? to the
accumulative effect of light on the photographic plate, photographs "can be
taken of objects otherwise invisible, as I pointed out years ago, for in photographs
I took in 1883 stars were shown on photographic plates that I could not ses in the

telescope. All photographs, when closely examined, are made up of a certain
number of little dots, as it were, iu the nature of stippling, and it is a very inter-
--672 Heport 1900.

esting point to consider tbe relation of the size and separation of these dots tliat
form the image, and the rods and cones of the reckoner which determines the

power of the e3'e.

    Many years ago I tried to determine this question. 1 first took a photograph
of the moon with a telescope of very short focus (as near as I could get it to the

focus of the eye itself, which is about half an inch). The resulting photograph

measured one two-hundredth of an inch in diameter, and when examined again

with a microscope showed a fair amount of detail, in fact, very much as we see
the moon with the naked eye ; making a picture of the moon by hand on such

a scale that each separate dot of which it was made corresponded with each

separate sensitive point of the retina employed when viewing the moon without

optical aid, I found, on looking at this picture at the proper distance, that it looked

exactly like a real moon. In this case the distance of the dots was constant, mak-

ing them larger or smaller forming the light or shade of the picture.

     I did not complete these experiments, but as far as I went I thought that there

was good reason to believe that we could in this way increase the defining power

of the eye. It is a subject well worthy of further consideration.

I know that in this imperfect and necessarily brief address I have been obliged

to omit the names of many workers, but I cannot conclude without alluding to the

Apart that this Association has played iu fostering and aiding Astronomy.                      glance

through the list of money grants shows that the help has been most liberal. In my

youth I recollect the great value that was put on the British Association Catalogue

of Stars ; we know the help that was given in its early days to the Kew Observa-

tory                     and the Reports of  the Association show the great interest that has  always
                      ;

been taken in our work. The formation of a separate Department of Astronomy is,

I hope, a pledge that this interest will be continued, to the advantage of our

science.

     1. On the Application of the Electric Telegraph to the Furtherance of
         Eclipse Research. By Professor David P. Todd, Director of the

           Observatory of Amherst College, U.S.A.

In 1878 the idea first occurred to the writer' of telegraphing' eastward in

advance of the lunar shadow in order to euahle the immediate verification of

Aany possible discovery as of an intramercurian planet without waiting for another
eclipse to take placo.  scheme of application to the eclipse of 1887 was

published,'-' but the feasibility of the method was not demonstrated till the eclipse

of January 1889, when the California observations were, by tlie courtesy of the

Western Union Telegraph Company, reported in New York with such celerity as

Ato outstrip completely the motion of the moon's shadow across the earth.^  like

experiment, only in more practical form, was carried out during the recent eclipse

by co-operation with Mr. A. E. Douglass, of the Lowell Observatory, whose station

was in Washington, Georgia. Totality there preceded the same phenomenon in

Tripoli, the writer's station, by 2 hours 45 minutes. Immediately totality was

over, Mr. Douglass reported in full the success of his observations and the instru-

ments with which they were made, his despatch being forwarded at once to

Washington and New York, and over the Western Union Company's cables to
Penzance. By the courtesy of J. Denison Pender, Esq., Vice-President and

Managing Director of the Eastern Telegraph Company, London, the messao-e was

forwarded over this company's cables from Penzance to Gibraltar, thence to'"lMalta

and finally to Tripoli, where a special messenger delivered it at once to the writer at

the British Consulate. This message was received and read in less than half an

hour of absolute time from its leaving Georgia, and more than two hours before
totality actually came on at Tripoli. Had the message announced any discovery
                                                                                    '
there was abundant time to have prepared for its special verification.

     The thanks of astronomers are especially due to the manao-ers of these
two great telegraph systems for their generous gift of this service, wliich has now

])roved conclusively the practicability of communication between remote eclipse

stations while the moon's shadow is still upon the earth. It is easy to see how
such communication, during the total eclipse of 188'.i, might have atl'orded data for

the orbit of the comet discovered duiing that eclipse, and whose path is now

unknown.

    Similarly, also, application of the land and cable lines of the globe may be of

the greatest service in notifying the occurrence of future meteoric showers.

2. On the Operation of Eclipse Instruments Automatically. By Professor

   David P. Todd, Director of the Observatory of Amherst College, U.S.A.

     The successful application of automatic machinery to a wide variety of n«e8
and purposes, removing the uncertainty of manual operations, indicates clearly the
desirability of its application to the photography of solar eclipses.

     Three distinct systems of controlling the mechanical movements of such
instruments are feasible, the capabilities of all of which I have tested vrithin

recent years

(a) The pneumatic system devised and built for the U.S. Eclinse E\n-jdiiinn
West Africa, 1889.'                                   '

holders was obtained by small collapsible pneumatic ' jjockets,' connected uit'h a

large exhaust iDellows by lead tubes of small calibre. The operation of the pockets

was controlled through a pneumatic commutator, the control sheet being of paper,
and having perforations at such points as corresponded to the mechanism or
instrument desired. This sheet unwound from the barrel of an ordinary chrono-
graph, -which thereby not only regulated the exposures, but recorded their exact
times. Twenty-two photographic instruments were controlled by this scheme of
operation at Cape Ledo, West Africa, on December 22, 1889.

     (h) The electric system devised and built for the Amherst Eclipse Expedition
to Japan, 1896, through the liberality of ISIessrs. Willis and Arthur James, of

New York, who sent the expedition out in their yacht Coronet} The power

requisite for the automatic movements was here derived for the most part from

spiral springs, the recoil of which was governed by specially devised escapements
operated by ordinary electro-magnets. The control currents were sent through a
commutator - which was originally a chronograph, the cylinder being replaced by
a copper barrel, in which pins were inserted at suitable points for making contacts
with the teeth of a copper comb. Thus, as in the pneumatic system, the commu-
tator regulated the exposures and recorded their times as Avell. Twenty photo-

graphic instruments were controlled by this scheme of operation at Esashi, Japan,

on August 9, 180G.

     (e) The mechanical system, devised and built for the expedition to Tripoli,
1900, and at the charges of Mr. Percival Lowell, of Boston. By the courtesy of
the Hon. T. S. Jago, H.B.M.'s Oonsul-General at Tripoli, the station was

established on the terrace or roof of the British Consulate. This location aflbrded,

among other advantages, an exceptional chance of utilising gravity as a motive
power for the mechanical operation of shutters and plate-holders by means of
cords wound upon pulleys which turned the axles, the cords being pulled by small
weio-hts which descended within the interior court of the Consulate. This system

not having been invented until after my arrival in Tripoli, its construction was neces-

sarily crude and provisional. In addition to the help of native artisans I had

the very efficient assistance of Messrs. W. H. Venables and W. F. Riley, of the

English colony in Tripoli. The commutator was again a barrel, improvised from a

 large oil-drum", and turned by a cord and heavy weight, its speed being regulated

 to the requisite accuracy by a fan governor. By the courtesy of Mr. James A.
Doughan this was built in the machine shops of Messrs. Perry, Bury, & Company.
 From the commutator barrel there unwound also seven cords which passed over

 pulleys to the various mechanical movements of the .shutters and plate-barrels,
 held in position by escapements similar to those used in Japan for the previous
 eclipse ; and upon these cords were fastened large beads at intervals suited to the

 exposures required. Each bead in pas.«ing the escapement tripped it, thus
 allowing gravity to advance the movement by a single stage or unit. Seven
 instruments were operated on this system during the recent eclipse at Tripoli, and

 about one hundred photographs secured.

     Experience with these three systems leads me to the conclusion that with

 slio-ht modifications the last is simplest and best for the automatic operation of a

 Tery few instruments. But a combination of the first and second is best for a large
 number of instruments, the mechanisms being no more likely to get out of order
 than the similar movements in the pneumatic and electric action of a modern
  church organ, and no more likely to tail of the right exposure on the right plate
 at the right time than such an organ is likely to sound a false or unintended note.

of yellow optical glass, backed with an equivalent negative wedge of plain optical

glass, the whole having a sliding motion lengthwise. The necessary thickness and

length of the wedges are first lound by experiment on the sun, entirely obscured

artiBcially by an occulting disc, excepting only the extreme limb. Through a

ruby aperture in the camera the observer watches the gradually diminishino-

eclipse crescent on the film, and racks the weds'e along, keeping the intensity of

the image as nearly as possible constant. The biograph films of the recent

eclipse, taken by Mr. J. N. Maskelyne, F.R.A.S., indicate the necessity of this

great reduction of the strong light of the crescents, to avoid solarisation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      and show

                5. On the Types of Sun-spot Disturbances.
                    By Rev. A. L. Cortie, F.R.A.S.

     As an aid to researches connected with sun-spots an attempt has been made

to classify them according to some prevailing typical forms. For this purpose the
Stonyhurst drawings of the solar surface for the last twenty years have been
caretully examined. From these it would follow that spots appear as scattered

groups of small spots, as trains of spots, as composite groups consisting of three or

more larger spots, as single spots of round and regular outline which may or may

not be accompanied by smaller companions, and as single spots of irreo-ular

outline at times accomjianied by a train of small companions, or with outliers not
arranged in the form of a train. The chief type, however, of which the above-
mentioned are in most, probably in all, cases but phases, is the double-spot

formation, with a train of smaller spots between tlie two principal spots of the
group. In this form the principal spot, which eventually becomes a round spot of
regular outline, is generallj' the leading spot ; but in some cases it is the followino-

spot, while in other yet rarer cases both the chief spots develop as regular spots'.

The mode of development of this leading type is described in detail. The
following are suggested as the types which will be probably found to cover every
case that may arise.

AType I. group of a few scattered small spots.

6. On a Chea'p Form of Micrometer for determining Star Positions on
    Photograjyhic Plates. By H. H. Turner, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian

      Professor.

The experience of those who have been worlilng at the Astrographie Chart

shows that for measuring star photographs a reseau is practically indispensable.

The rcseaux made by M. Gautier of Paris may be treated as sensibly correct for

nearly all purposes. The cost is between '21. and 5/., according to the number of

lines ruled                                                    and this initial  expense  is  in any case necessary.  But since a photo-
                                                            ;

graphic copy is often as good as the original, this expense might be shared

between two or three workers, or borne by some society, which could distribute

copies for a few shillings each to its members.

Given the reseau, the rest of the micrometer can be made at a very small

expense (say oO«. at most) with wood, glass, and paper. Of course, some conveni-

ence is sacrificed and a little accuracy lost. The micrometers in use at the Gape of
Good Hope cost 180/. apiece ; the duplex micrometer used at Greenwich about

100/. ; even the simple form used at Oxford costs 30Z. It is not to be supposed

that nothing is gained by such expenditure. But with a very simple form of
instrument such as that exhibited, which a man could make for himself or with a

little assistance from any carpenter, excellent work can he done.

The chief part of the instrument is the microscope with scale in the eyepiece.

Most people have some old microscope which would do quite well, and in any case

a cheap one is all that is necessary. The scale in the eyepiece can be made

photographically, drawing the scale on a large sheet of cardboard and takino- a

miniature photograph of it.

     The plate-holder is merely a sheet of glass on which the plate can be easily
moved backwards and forwards. The screws required for slow motion and

clamping maj^ be ordinary electrical binding-screws or something similar the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

counterpoises bags of shot ; the reflector a penny mirror, and so on.

To measure photographs which have no reseau already impressed upon them,

a photographic copy of a reseau may be bound up in contact with the plate in the

manner of a lantern slide. Attention may, however, be directed to a method of

impressing the reseau on such plates which have been already developed and

fixed,' due to M. Bourget, of the Toulouse Observatory.

     It wag found that during the two and a half hours' difference of time
between the times of totality the main prominences had changed considerably
in shape and form, but the polar rifts at the north polar region did not undergo
any alteration.

     The comparison has further led the author to advocate the employment of
long-focus cameras for such eclipse work, and to eliminate the necessity of

enlargement afterwards.

    An explanation is also given to account for the extreme sharpness of the

lunar limb on one of the long-exposure photographs, the chief argument employed
being the very rapid diminution of intensity of the corona as the outer layers

are reached.

    I have recently had occasion to make some investigations in connection with
the theory of Comet 1899, I. The object of the present paper is not to call

attention to the form of the orbit, so that that point need not be considered.
     But in the course of the examination of the observations I was led to com-

pare a series of places .of the comiit obtained under the superintendence of the

Astronomer Royal, by means of photography with the Thompson Equatorial.
     There is, so far as I know, no series of equal length in which the places of a

moving object have been determined by photography, and it seemed desirable to
investigate the peculiarities with some care.

    The series extends from May 'lo to June 10, 1899, during which time the

comet passed over some 80° of R.A. and 30° of declination.
     It is not usual to compare the final elements with individual observations, but

only with the normal plnces. The photographed places have therefore been com-
pared with the preliminary orbit, in this case an hyperbola : and the small deviations,
which are removed by the solution of the Equations of Condition, are displayed in

the comparison.

     But for the purposes of the present investigation it is sufficient to remove
these discrepancies by any convenient interpolation formula, and so obtain the
deviations of the observations from the true path of the comet.

    When this is effected the following deviations are noticeable :

     The declinations in tlie early part of the series are eminently satisfactory; in
that part the motion was very small in S. Towards the end, when the comet was
moving quicker, the agreement is not so satisfactory.

     The right ascension varied most rapidly at the beginning of the series, and
the agreement would have been more satisfactory throughout, though more
noticeable at the beginning, if the epoch of observation had been some seconds

later.

      It is a very difficult matter to determine the proper time of exposure, since the
first few seconds in the photograph of a faint object do not seem to be used in the
blackening of the film.

     The importance of this point in the photographs of Eros recommended by the
International Oomite de la Carte du Ciel will not escape the attention of

astronomers.

     There is another point: how do these observations compare with those made
micrometrically in a typical observatory f To illustrate this I select that of

Strassburg, where the observations are of unusual excellence, and where the focal
length of the instrument is fairly comparable with that of the Greenwich tele-
scope. The series of Strassburg within tlie same dates, and over which the same
interpolation formula is available, is not quite so long, but fairly comparable. The
Greenwich places I'est in every case, it is believed, on the positions of three stars,
the Strassburg never on more than two, and sometimes on a single comparison.
The error in the star's place is therefore more effective. The errors are as

follows :

Hegresenting light as area, these stars approximate very happily to steps of

quarter magnitudes.

Half-a-dozen sheets are laid, blue side down, on a sheet of lead, the original

map laid over them, and the stars punched through with the proper-sized needles.

3. At night a copy is laid on a writing-desk with a sloping ground glass top,

and illuminated with a night light, which also keeps them dry.

The meteor track (when observed) is marked in pencil along n celluloid rulei

with a blackened bevel-edge, which, being transparent, does not hide the

configuration of the stars on the map.

4. Obseriing. After comparing my watch with Greenwich time, I sit back in a

hammock choir with the illuminated map beside me, a pencil and ruler handy. I find

I can hold my eye far more steadily on the meteor's place than a wand held in the

hand, which I therefore do not use. I cannot usefully extend my field beyond 45°

myon either side of the point facing me, except for bright meteors. I let  eyes

continually rove about, and when a meteor appears I fasten on it at once, and
all the stars fade out ; but only for an instant during which I am free to observe

the magnitude.! colour, speed, and streak. Presently the nearest stars begin to

glimmer out again and set themselves as a framework round the place of the

meteor. But I do not look away at them tdl I have thoroughly impressed a

mental picture of the meteor as part of the scene before me. Whilst doing so I

estimate its duration. But the most important thing is the direction. I follow

its line cautiously backwards and forwards, prolonging it until I find suitable

--reference stars : either, that the line lies over a star or passes a degree or two
--from it or cuts the distance between two stars in a certain proportion. Thus 1

get two reference points some ten or twenty degrees apart. Next I define to

myself the length of path as starting and ending on the line joining two stars, or so

many degrees before or after that line.

lieturning to the estimation of duration, I use Professor Herschel's excellent

W--method of repeating the alphabet over at the rate of five letters to the second,
leaving out  the only letter not monosyllabic.

Now I look at my watch and note the time of apyearcmce.

As to the advisability of using maps at all, if the observer knows the stars by

heart in configuration and by name, he may very well dispense with maps, &c.,

describing the meteor and defining its position in words in a notebook iu the dark,

while still looking at the star lest he miss another meteor. But not many have

--such knowledge : and the conciseness of the record a single lino on the map

recommends itself compared with a description needing many words. To look away

from the sky, down on the map, is a relief to the eye-- at the cost, it is true, of

possibly losing a meteor, though it must be difficult to go on writing down the

description of one meteor while studying another.

     Looking down therefore on the map, I set the transparent ruler to the best of

my judgment, guiding myself by the reference points I have decided upon, and run

a pencil along for the length of path, finishing with a half arrow-head to show

the direction, and write the time alongside, and the description at the edge of the

map ; taking the line back also lightly towards the radiant. It is astonishing
how slight a shift satisfies or dissatisfies one, but it is worse than useless to look

up again at the sky.

Next day the end points of the paths are read oflf for tabulation through a

'spider web' of R.A. and Decl. lines on tracing cloth laid over the map.

     The President delivered the following Address :

        The Modern System of Teaching Fracticallnorganic Chemistry
                                       and its Develojmient.

In choosinp: for the subject of my Address to-day the development of the teaching

of practical inorganic chemistry I do so, not only on account of the great import-
ance of the subject, but also because it does not appear that this matter has been
brought before this Section, in the President's Address at all events, during the
last few years.

      In dealing generally with the subject of the teaching of chemistry as a branch

of science it may be well in the first place to consider the value of such teaching as

a means of general education, and to turn our attention for a few minutes to the
development of the teaching of science in schools.

     There can be no doubt that there has been great progress in the teaching of
science in schools during the last forty years, and this is very evident from the
perusal of the essay, entitled 'Education: Intellectual, Moral, and Physical,'
which Herbert Spencer wrote in 1859. After giving his reasons for considering
the study of science of primary importance in education, Herbert Spencer con-

tinues : ' "While what we call civilisation could never have arisen had it not

been for science, science forms scarcely an appreciable element in our so-called

civilised training.'

    From this it is apparent that science was not taught to any appreciable extent

in schools at that date, though doubtless in some few schools occasional lectures
were given on such scientilic subjects as physiologj', anatomy, astronomy, and

mechanics.
     Herbert Spencer's pamphlet appears to have had only a very gradual effect

towards the introduction of science into schemes of education. For many years

chemical instruction was only given in schools at the schoolroom desk, or at the
best from the lecture table, and many of the most modern of schools had no

laboratories.

     The first school to give any practical instruction in chemistry was apparently
the City of London School, at which, in the year 1847, Mr. Hall was appointed
teacher of chemistry, and there he continued to teach until 1869.' Besides
the lecture theatre and a room for storing apparatus, Mr. Hall's department

     ' Mr. A. T. Pollard, M.A., Head Master of the City of London School, has kindly
instituted a search among the bound copies of the boys' terminal reports, and informs
me that in the School form of Terminal Keport a heading for Chemistry was intro-
duced in the year 1847, the year of Mr. Hall's appointment.

contained a long room, or rather passage, leadinfr into tlie lecture tlieatl'e, and
closed at each end -with glass doors. In this room, which was fitted up as a
laboratory, and used principally as a preparation room for the lectures, Mr. Hall

performed experiments with the few hoys who assisted him with his lectures. As

accommodation was at that time strictly limited, he nsed to suggest simple
experiments and encourage the boys to carry them out at home, and afterwards
he himself would examine the substances which they had made.

     From this small beginning the teaching of chemistry in the City of London
School rapidly developed, and this school now possesses laboratories which

compare favourably with those of any school in the country.

     The Manchester Grammar School appears to have been one of the first to teach
practical chemistry. In connection with this school a small laboratory was built
in 1868: this was replaced by a larger one in 1872, and the present large labora-

tories, under the charge of Mr. Francis Jones, were opened in 1880.

     Dr. Marshall Watts, who was the first science master in this school, taught
practical chemistry along with the theoretical work from the commencement in

1868.

    As laboratories were gradually multiplied it might be supposed that boys were

given the opportunity to carry out experiments which had a close connection with
their lecture-room courses. But the programme of laboratory work which became
all but universal was the preparation of a few gases, followed by the practice of
qualitative analysis. The course adopted seems to have been largely built up on
the best books of practical chemistry in use in the colleges at that time but it was

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

also, no doubt, largely influenced by the requirements of the syllabus of the
Science and Art Department, which contained a scheme for teaching practical

chemistry.' Even down to quite recent times it was in many schools still not

considered essential that boys should have practical instruction in connection with

lectures in chemistry.

   A Report issued in 1897 by a special Committee appointed by the Technical

Education Board of the London County Council adduces evidence of this from
twenty-five secondary schools in London, in which there were 3,960 boys learning
chemistry. Of these 1,698 boys, or 43 per cent., did no practical work whatever

' I find on inquiry at tlie P.oard of Education that practical work in qualitative

analysis formed part of the examinations for teachers" certificates in inorganic

chemistry which were held at South Kensington annually in November from 1859

Ato 1806 inclusive.                             syllabus for this examination was published in the Science

Directory for 1859, the following portion of which relates to practical work:

' Outlines of Qualitative Analysis. Reactions of the principal mineral acids and

bases. Course pursued in the application of these reactions to the analysis of a

mixture of several acids and bases.' Three questions were set involving the quali-

tative analysis of (1) a mixture of two acids and two bases soluble in water or

acids                           (2)  a mixture of two  acids and two bases partly or entirely insoluble in water
                             ;

and  acids                           (3)  more  complicated  mixtures.  The candidates for these certificates
                                  ;

were not examined in practical organic chemistry.

The first practical examination in chemistry for students was held by the Board

in 1878, in the Advanced Stage and Honours only of inorganic chemistry, the analysis

of simple salts being prescribed in the former, and of complex mixtures in the latter

examination. Previously to this, however, special extra payments had been made on

the results of instruction in practical chemistry, and questions dealing with labora-

tory practice were set in the ordinary written examinations in chemistry, and were

' as far as possible so framed as to prevent answers being given by pupils who had

obtained their information merely from books and oral instruction.' The Inspector,

however, when visiting the schools might call upon anj^ students who were to be

presented for these special grants to perform experiments in his presence. This

system was continued in the elementary stage of inorganic chemistry till 1882.

In 1878 the syllabus for organic chemistry extended these two methods of

practical examination to that branch of the subject. In the syllabus published in

1 882 the present division in all stages of both organic and inorganic chemistry into

distinct theoretical and practical examinations was commenced.
                   TEANSACTIOiVS OF SECTION B.  683

955 boys, or 24 percent., did practical work, consisting of a certain amount of

preparation of gases, together with qualitative analysis ; but of these latter 74o,
or 77 per cent., had not reached the study of the metals in their theoretical work,
so that their testing work can have been of little educational Talue. It was also
found that in the case of 655, or G8 per cent, of the total number of boys taking
practical work, the lirst introduction to practical chemistry was through quali-

tative analysi:?.

But some years before this Report was issued a movement had begun which

Awas destined to have a far-reaching efltect.  Report ' on the best means for pro-

moting Scientific Education in Schools' having been presented to the Dundee

Meeting of this Association in 1867, and published in 1868, a Committee of the
British Association was appointed in 1887 ' for the purpose of inquiring and
reporting upon the present methods of teaching chemistry.' The well-known
Report which this Committee presented to the Newcastle Meeting in 1889 insisted

that it was worth while to teach chemistry in schools, not so much for the useful-

ness of the information imparted as for the special mental discipline it afforded if
the scientific method of investigating nature were employed. It was argued that

' learners should be put in the attitude of discoverers, and led to make observations,

experiments, and inferences for themselves.' And since there can be little progress

without measurement, it was pointed out that the experimental work would

necessarily be largely of a quantitative character.

     Professor H. E. Armstrong, in a paper read at a conference at the Health
Exhibition five years before this, had foreshadowed much that was in this Report.

He also drew up a detailed scheme for 'a course of elementary instruction in

physical science,' which was included in the Report of the Committee, and it
cannot be doubted that this scheme and the labours of the Committee have had
a very marked influence on the development of the teaching of practical chemistry
in schools. That this influence has been great will be admitted when it is under-

stood that schemes based on the recommendation of the Committee are now
included in the codes for both Elementary Day Schools and Evening Continuation
Schools. The recent syllabuses for elementary and advanced courses issued by the

Incorporated Association of Headmasters and by the Oxford and Cambridge local
boards and others are evidently directly inspired by the ideas set forth by the
Committee.

The Department of Science and Art lias also adopted some of the sugges-

tions of the Committee, and a revised syllabus was Lssued by the Department in
1895, in which qualitative analysis is replaced by quantitative experiments of a
simple form, and by other exercises so framed ' as to prevent answers being given
by students who have obtained their information from books or oral instruction.'
This was a very considerable advance, but it must be admitted that there is
nothing in the syllabus which encourages, or even suggests, placing the learners in

the attitude of discoverers, and this, in the opinion of the Committee of this

Association, is vital if the teaching is to have educational value.

    Many criticisms have been passed upon the 1889 Report. It has been said
that life is much too short to allow of each individual advancing from the known

to the unknown, according to scientific methods, and that even were this not so
too severe a tax is made upon the powers of boys and girls. In answer to the

second point it will be conceded that while it is doubtless futile to try to teach

chemistry to young children, on the other hand experience has abundantlj^ shown
that the average schoolboy of fourteen or fifteen can, with much success, investigate
such problems as were studied in the researches of Black and Scheele, of Priestley

and Cavendish and Lavoisier, and it is quite remarkable with what interest such
young students carry out this class of work.

    It may be well to quote the words which Sir Michael Foster used in this
connection in his admirable Presidential Address to this Association in 1899. He
said : ' The learner may be led to old truths, even the oldest, in more ways than
one. He may be brought abruptly to a truth in its finished form, coming straight

to it like a thief climbing over a wall ; and the hurry and press of modern life

tempt many to adopt this quicker way. Or he may be more slowly guided along
684 MpokT-- 1900.

the path by which the truth was reached hy him who first laid hold of it. It is by
this latter way of learning the truth, and by this alone, that the learner may hope

to catch something at least of the spirit of the scientific inquirer.'
      I believe that in the determination of a suitable school course in experimental

science this principle of historical development is a very valuable guide, although

it is not laid down iu the 1889 Report of the British Association.
     The application of this principle will lead to the study of the solvent action of

water, of crystallisation, and of the separation of mixtures of solids before the
investigation of the composition of water, and also before the investigation of the
phenomena of combustion. It will lead to the investigation of hydrochloric acid
before chlorine, and especially to the postponement of atomic and molecular
theories, chemical equations, and the laws of chemical combination, until the

studen t has really sufficient knowledge to understand how these theories came to

be necessary.

     There can be no doubt that this new system of teaching chemistry in schools

has been most successful. Teachers are delighted with the results which have

already been obtained, and those whom I have had the opportunity of consulting,

directly and indirectly, cannot speak too highly of their satisfaction at the dis-

appearance of the old "system of qualitative analysis, and the institution of the new
order of things. Especially I may mention in this connection the excellent work
which is being carried on under tlie supervision of Dr. Bevan Lean at the Friends'

School in Ackworth, where the boys have attained results which are far in advance
of anything which would have been thought possible a few years since.

     It is, of course, obvious that if a schoolboy is made to take the attitude of
a discoverer his progress may appear to be slow. But does this matter ? Most
boys will not become professional chemists ; but if while at school a boy learns
how to learn, and how to ' make knowledge ' ^ by working out for himself a few
problems, a habit of mind will be formed which will enable him in future
years to look in a scientific spirit at any new problems which may face him.

When school-days are past the details of the preparation of hydrogen may have

been forgotten but if it was really understood at the time that it could not be
                                                                                      ;

 decided at once whether the gas was derived from the acid or from the metal, or
 from the water, or in part from the one and in part from the other, an attitude
 of scepticism and of suspended judgment will have been formed, which will

 continue to guard from error.

      In the new system of teaching chemistry in schools much attention must
 necessarily be given to weights and measurements; indeed, the work must be

 largely of a quantitative kind, and it is in this connection that an important note
 of warning has been sounded by several teachers." They consider, very rightly,
 that it is important to point out clearly to the scholar that science does not consist
 of measurement, but that measurement is only a tool in the hand of the in-
 quirer, and that when once sufficient skill has been developed in its use it should
 be emploved only with a distinct object. Measurements should, in fact, be made
 only in reference to some actual problem which appears to be really worth solving,

 not in the accumulation of aimless details.
       And, of course, all research carried out must be genuine and not sham, and

 all assumption of the ' obvious ' must be most carefully guarded against. But the
 young scholar must, at the same time, not forget that although the scientific
 method is necessary to enable him to arrive at a result, in real life it is the

 answer to the problem which is of the most importance.^

      Although, then, there has been so much discussion, during the last ten years,
  on the subject of teaching chemistry in schools, and such steady progress has been
 made towards devising a really satisfactory system of teaching the subject to young
  boys and girls, it is certainly very remarkable that practically nothing has been

said or written bearing on the training which a student who wishes to become a

chemist is to undertake at the close of his school-days at the college or university

in which his education is continued.

    One of the most remarkable points, to my mind, in connection with the teaching

of chemistry is the fact that although the science has been advancing year by year
with such unexampled rapidity, the coarse of training which the student goes
through during his first two years at most colleges is still practically the same as
it was thirty or forty years ago. Then, as now, after preparing a few of the

principal gases, the student devotes the bulk of his first year to qualitative analysis

in the dry and wet way, and his second year to quantitative analysis, and,

although the methods employed in teaching the latter may possibly have under-

gone some slight modification, there is certainly no great clitference between the
routine of simple salt and mixture practised at the present day and that which
was in vogue in the days of our fathers and grandfathers.

      Since, then, the present system has held the field for so long, not only in this
country but also on the Continent, it is worth while considering whether it affords

the best training which a student who wishes to become a chemist can undergo in

the short time during which he can attend at a college or university. In con-
sidering this matter I was led in the first place to carefidly examine old books

and other records, with the object of finding out how the present system originated,
and I think that valuable and interesting information bearing on the subject may

be obtained from a very brief sketch of the rise and development of the present
system of teaching chemistry, and especially in so far as it bears on the inclusion

of quahtative analysis. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to gain a good historical
acquaintance with the matter as I at first imagined would be the case, and this is
due in a large measure to the fact that so few of the laboratories which took an
active part in the development of the present system of chemical training have
left any record of the methods which they employed. In this connection I may,
perhaps, be allowed to suggest that it would be a valuable help to the future
historian if all prominent teachers of chemistry would leave behind them a brief
record of the system of teaching adopted in their laboratories, showing the changes
which they had instituted, the object of these changes, and the results which

followed their adoption.

     There is no doubt that the progress of practical chemistry went largely hand
in hand with the progress of theoretical chemistry, for as the latter gradually

developed, so the necessity for the determination of the composition, first of the

best known, and then of the rarer minerals and other substances, became more and
more marked.

    The analytical examination of substances in the diy way was employed in very

early times in connection with metallurgical operations, and especially in the

determination of the presence of valuable constituents in samples of minerals,

Cupellation was used by the Greeks in the separation of gold and silver from their
ores and in the purification of these metals, Geber knew that the addition of
nitre to the ore facilitated the separation of gold and silver, and subsequently
Glauber (1604-1668) called attention to the fact that many commoner metals cciuld
easily be separated from their ores with the aid of nitre.

    Btit it was not till the eighteenth century that any marked progress was made
in analysis in the dry way, and the progress which then became rapid was

undoubtedly due to the discovery of the blowpipe, and to the introduction of its
use into analytical operations. The blowpipe is mentioned for the first time in
1660, in the transactions of the Accademia del Cimento of Florence, but the first
to recommend its use in chemical operations was Johann Andreas Cramer in
1739. The progress of blowpipe analysis was largely due to Gahn (1745-

1818), who spent much time in perfecting its use in the examination of minerals,
and it was he who first used platinum wire and cobalt solution in connection with
blowpip'e analysis. The methods employed by Gahn were further develcfped by
his friedid Berzelius (1779-1848), who gave much attention to the matter, and wlio

with great skill and patience gradually worked out a complete scheme of blowpipe
aualy&iK, and ptiblishe'd it in a p'ampblet, entitled ' Ueher die Anwiendung des
G8G REPORT-- 1900.

Lotlirolirs,' wWcli appeared in 1820. After tlie puWication of this work blowpipe
anal5^sis rapidly came into general use in England, France, and Germany, and the
scheme devised by Berzelius is essentially that employed at the present day.

    Indeed, the only notable additions to the methods of analysis in the dry way

Blnce the time of Berzelius are the development of tlame reactions, which Bunsen
worked out with such characteristic skill and ingenuity, and the introduction of the

spectroscope.

    The necessity for some process other than that of analysis in the dry way

seems, in the first instance, to have arisen in quite early times in connection with
the examination of drugs, not only on account of the necessity for discovering
their constituents, but also as a means of determining whether they were adul-

terated. In such cases analysis in the dry way was obviously unsuitable, and ex-
perience soon showed that the only way to arrive at the desired result was to

treat the substance under esaminatiou with aqueous solutions of definite sub-
stances, the first reagent apparently being a decoction of o-allnuts. which is
described by Pliny as being employed in detecting adulteration with green

vitriol.

The pTOgi'ess made in connection with wet analysis was, however, exceedingly

slow, largely owing to the lack of reagents ; Init as these were gradually discovered

wet analysis rapidly developed, especially in the hands of Tachenius, Scheele,

Boyle, Ho tlman, Margraf, and Bergmann. Boyle (i626-lC'Jl) especially had an

extensive knowledge of  reagents and their  application                                                      and, indeed, it  was  Boyle
                                                                                                          ;

who first introduced the word ' analysis ' for those operations by which substances

may be recognised in the presence of one another. Boyle knew how to test for

silver with hydrochloric acid, for calcium salts with sulphuric acid, and for coptper
by the blue solution produced by ammonia.

     Margraf (1709-1782) introduced prussiate of potash for the detection of iron, and

Bergmann (1735-1784) not only introduced new reagents and new methods for

decomposing minerals and refractory substances, such as fusion with potash, diges-
tion with nitric acid or hydrochloric acid, but he also was the first to suggest
the application of tests in a systematic way, and, indeed, the metliod of analysis

which he developed is on much the same lines as that in use at the present dcay.
He paid special attention to the qualitative analysis of minerals, and gave careful

instructions for the analysis of gold, platinum, silver, lead, copper, zinc, and other
ores. The work of Sicheele (1742-1 7y6) had indirectly a great inlluence on quali-

tative analysis, as, although he did not give a general systematic method of
procedure in the analysis of substances of unknown composition, yet the methods
which he emjjloyed in the examination of new substances wore so original and

exact as to remain models of how qualitative analysis should be conducted.
    Great strides in analytical chemistry in the wet way were made through the work

of Berzelius, who, by the discovery of new methods, such as the decouiposition of
silicates by hydrofluoric acid and the introduction of new tests, greatly advanced

the art. lie paid special attention to perfecting the methods of analysis of mineral
waters, and these researches as well as his work on ores, and particularity his investi-
gation of platinum ores, stamp Berzelius as one of the great pioneers in qualitative

and quantitative analytical chemistr}^

    By the labours of the great experimenters whom I have mentioned qualitative
analysis gradually acquired the familiar appearance of to-day, and many

books were written with the object of arranging the mass of information which
had accumulated, and of thus rendering it available for the student in his efforts to

investigate tho composition of new minerals and other substances. Among these

books maj' bo mentioned the * Handbuch der analytischen Chemie,' by 11. Kose,
and especially the well-known analytical text-books of Eresenius, which have had
an extraordinarily wide circulation and jiassed through many editions.

     The work of the great pioneers in analytical chemistry was work done often

under circumstances of great difficulty, as before the end of the seventeenth cen-
tury there were no public institutions of any sort in which a practical knowledge

of chemistry could be acquired. Lectures were, of course, given from very early
times, but it was not until the time of Guillaame Francois Kouelle (1703-1770), at
TBANSACTIOXS OF SECTIOX B.  687

the beginning of tlie eighteenth century, that lectures began to be illustrated

by experiments. Rouelle, who was very active as a teacher, numbered among bis
pLipils many men of eminence, such as Lavoisier and Proust, and it was largely

owing to his influence that France took such a lead in practical teaching. In

Germany progress was much slower, and in our country the introduction of lectures

illustrated by experiments seems to have been mainly due to Davy.

    When it is considered how slowly experimental work came to be recognised

as a means of illustration and education, even in connection with lectures, it is not
surprising that in early times practical teaching in laboratories should have been

thought quite unnecessary.
     The few laboratories which existed in the sixteenth century were built mainly

for the practice of alchemy by the reigning princes of the time, and, indeed, up to

the beginning of the nineteenth century, the private laboratories of the great
masters were the only schools in which a favoured few might study, but which

were not open to the public. Thus we tind that Berzelius received in his laboratory
a limited number of students who worked mostly at research: these were not

usually young men, and his school cannot thus be considered as a teaching institu-

tion in the ordinary sense of the word.
     The first really great advance in laboratory teaching is due to Liebig, who, after

working for some years in Paris rmder Gay-Lussac, was appointed in 1824 to be
Professor of Chemistry in Giessen. Liebig was strongly impressed with the neces-
sity for public institutions where any student could study chemistry, and to him

fell the honour of founding the world-famed Giessen Laboratory, the first public

institution in Germany which brought practical chemistry within the reach of all

students.

      Giessen rapidly became the centre of chemical interest in Germany, and students
flocked to the laboratory in such numbers as to necessitate the development of a

systematic course of practical chemistry, and in this way a scheme of teaching was
devised which, as we shall see later, has served as the foundation for the system of

practical chemistry in use at the present day.

    When the success of this laboratory had been clearly established many other

towns discovered the necessity for similar institutions, and in a comparatively short
time every university in Germany possessed a chemical laboratory. The teaching
(if practical chemistry in other countries was, however, of very slow growth ; in
France, for example, AVurtz in 1869 drew attention to the fact that there was at
that time only one laboratory which could compare with the German laboratories,

 namely, that of the Ecole Normale Superieure.
      Tlie earliest laboratory for teaching purposes in Grent Britain was that of

 Thomas Thomson, wlio, after graduating in Edinburgh in 1799, began lecturing in

 that city in 1800, and opened a laboratory for the practical instruction of his pupils.
 Thomson was appointed lecturer in Chemistry in Glasgow TJniversity in 1807,
 and Regius Professor in 1818, and in Glasgow he also opened a general laboratory.

       Actual progress in the general establishment of laboratories for the study ol

 chemistry seems to date from the time of Thomas Graham, who in 18^0 was. ap-

 pointed Professor of Chemistry at Anderson's College in Glasgow, and in 1837 at
 University College, London. Whether practical chemistry was taught in Anderson's
 College at that time I have not been able to ascertain, but there is no doubt that

 regular courses in testing and systematic analysis were given by Graham from 1837

 to the date of his resignation in 1855.

      In 1845 the College of Chemistry was founded in London, an institution which

 under A. W. Hofmann's guidance rapidly rose to such a prominent position, and

 in 1851 Frankland was appointed to the chair of chemistry in the new college
 founded in Manchester by tlie trustees of John Owens, and here he equipped a
 laboratory for the teaching r^practical chemistry. Under Sir Henry Roscoe this
 laboratory soon became too small for the growing number of chemical students,
 a defect which was removed when the new buildings of the college were opened
 in 1873. In 1849 Alexander Williamson was appointed Professor of Practical
 Chemistry at University College, London, where he introduced the practical
 methods of Liebig".
--SS8
REPORT 1900.

     Following these examples, the older universities gradually came to see tha
necessity for providing accommodation for the practical teaching of chemistry, with
the result that well-equipped laboratories have been erected in all the centres of

learning in this country.

     Since Liebig, by the establishment of the Giessen Laboratorj', must be looked
upon as the pioneer in the development of practical laboratory teaching, it will
be interesting to endeavour to obtain some idea of the methods which he used in

the training of the students who attended his laboratory in Giessen. From small

beginnings he gradually introduced a systematic course of practical chemistry, and
a careful comparison shows that this was similar in many ways to that in use at
the present day. The student at Giessen, after preparing the more important
gases, was carefully trained in qualitative and quantitative analysis; he was then
required to make a large number of preparations, after which he engaged in original

research.

     Although there is, as far as I have been able to ascertain, no printed record of
the nature of the quantitative work and the preparations which Liebig required
from his students, the course of qualitative analysis is easily followed, owing to the
existence of a most interesting book pubHshed for the use of the Gies.s^-n students.

     In 1846, at Liebig's request, Henry Will, Ph.D , Extraordinary Professor of

Chemistry iu the University of Giessen, wrote a small boolc, for use at Giessen,
called * Giessen Outlines of Analysis,' which shows clearly the kind of instruction

given in that laboratory at the time in so far as qualitative analysis is concerned.
This book, which contains a preface by Lieb'g, is purticularly interesting on

account of tlie fact that it is evidently the first Introduction to Analysis intended
for the training of elementary students wliicli was ever published. In the preface

Liebig writes : ' The want ot an introduction to chemical analysis adapted for the
use of a laboratory has given rise to the present work, which contains an accurate

description of the course I have followed in my laborritory witli great advantage
for twenty-five years. It has been prepared at my request by Professor AVill, who
has been my assistant during a great part of this period.'

     This book undoubtedly had a considerable circulation, and -was used in most of
the laboratories which were in existence at t'lat time, and thus we iind, for example,

rhat the Eng-lish traasiatioa which Liebig 'hopes and believes will be acceptable
to the English public ' was the book used by Hofmann for his students at the

College of Chemistry. In this book the metals are first divided into groups much
in the same way as is done now ; each pvoup is then separately dealt with, the

priucipal characteristics of the metals of the group are noted, and their reactions

studied. Those tests whicli are usel'ul in the detection of each metal are particularly
emphasised, and the reasons given for selecting certain of them as of special value

for the purposes of separating one metal from another.

     Throughout this section of the book there nre frequent discussions as to the
possible methods of the separation, not only of the metals of one group, but of
those belonging to different groups ; and the whole subject is treated in a manner
which shows clearly that Liebig's great object was to make the student think for

himself. After studying in a similar manner the behaviour of the principal acids
with reagents, the student is introduced to a course of qualitative analysis com-

prising, 1. preliminary examination of solids; 2, qualitative analysis of the
substance in solution.

Both sections are evidently written with the object not only of constructing a

system of qualitative analysis, but more particularly of clearly leading the student

to argue out for himself the methods of separation which he will ultimately adopt.

The ioook concludes with a few tables which differ considerably in design from

those in use at the present day, and which are so meagre that the student could

not possibly have used them mechanically.  '·«

The system introduced in this book, no doubt owing to the excellent results

obtained by its use, was rapidly recognised as the standard method bf teaching

analysis in most of the institutions existing at that time. Soon the courte began

to be further developed^ book after book was published on the subject, and

gi'adually the t'eathin'g of 'qualifativ'e analysis asSume'd th'e sliajte aird ibrm with
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B,              689

whicli we are all so well acquainted. Bat tbe present-day book on qualitative

analysis differs widely from ' Giessen Outlines ' in this respect, that whereas in the

latter the tables introduced are mere indications of the methods of separation to

be employed, and are of such a nature that the student who did not think for

himself must have been constantly in difficulties, in the book of the present day these

tables have been worked out to the minutest detail. Every contingency is

provided for ; nothing is left to the originality of the student ; and that which, no

doubt, was once an excellent course has now become so hopelessly mechanical as
to make it doubtful whether it retains anything of its former educational value.

    The question which I now wish to consider more particularly is whether the

system of training chemists which is at present adopted, with little variation, in our

colleges and universities is a really satisfactory one, and whether it supplies the

student with the kind of knowledge which will be of the most value to him in his

future career.

    Those who study chemistry may be roughly divided as to their future

--careers into two groups those who become teachers and those who become

technical chemists. Now, whether the student takes up either the one or the other

career, I think that it is clear that the objects to be aimed at in training him are

to give him a sound knowledge of his subject, and especially to so arrange his

studies as to briilg out in every possible way his capacity for original thought.

   A teacher who has no originality will hardly be successful, even though he

may possess a very wide knowledge of what has already been done in the past.
He will have little enthusiasm for his subject, and will continue to teach on the

lines laid down by the text-books of the day, without himself materially improving

the existing methods, and, above all, he will be unable, and will have no desire,

to add to our store of knowledge by original investigation.

     It is in the power of almost every teacher to do some research work, and it

seems probable that the reason why more is not done by teachers is that the

importance of research work was not sufficiently insisted on, and their original

faculty was not sufficiently trained, at the schools and colleges where they received

their education.

    And these remarks apply with equal force to the student who subsequently

becomes a technical chemist.

In the chemical works of to-day sound knowledge is essential, but originality

Ais an even more important matter.  technical chemist without originality can

scarcely rise to a responsible position in a large works, whereas a chemist who is

capable of constantly improving the processes in operation, and of adding new

methods to those in use, becomes so valuable that he can command his own terms.

    Now, this being so, I think it is extraordinary that so many of the students

--who go through the prescribed course of training say for the Bachelor of Science

--degree not only show no originality themselves, but seem also to have no desire

at the conclusion of their studies to engage in original investigation under the

mysupervision of the teacher. That this is so is certainly   experience as a teacher

examiner, and I feel sure that many other teachers will endorse this view of the

and case.

    If we inquire into the reason for this deficiency in originality we shall, I think,

1)6 forced to conclude that it is in a large measure due to the conditions of study

and the nature of the courses through which the student is obliged to pass.

   A well-devised system of quantitative analysis is undoubtedly valuable in

teaching the student accurate manipulation, but it has always seemed to me that

the long course of qualitative analysis which is usually considered necessary,
and which generally precedes the quantitative work, is not the most satisfactory

training for a student.

There can be no doubt that to many students qualitative analysis is little more

than a mechanical exercise : the tables of separation are learnt by heart, and every
substance is treated in precisely the same manner : such a course is surely not

calci^lated to develop any original faculty which the student may possess. Then,
again, when the student passes on to quantitative analysis, he receives elaborate

instructions as to the little details he must observe in order to get an accurate

result ; and even after he liasljecome familiar with tlie simpler determinations be.

rarely attempts, and indeed has no time to attempt, anything of the nature of an
oricfinal investigation in qualitative or quantitative analysis. It indeed sometimes

happens that a t^tudent at the end of his second year has never prepared a pure
substance, and is often utterly ignorant of the methods employed in the separation
of suhstauces by crystallisation ; he has never conducted a distillation, and has no

idea how to investigate the nature and amounts of substances formed in chemical

reactions; practically all his time has been taken up with analysis. That this is

not the way to teach chemistry was certainly the opinion of Liebig, and in

support of this I quote a paragraph bearing on the subject which occurs in a very

interesting book on ' Justus von Liebig: his Life and Work,' written by W. A.

Shenstone (pp. 17-5, 176).
     ' In his practical teaching Liebig laid great stress on the producing of chemical

preparations ; on the students preparing, that is to say, pure substances in good

quantity from crude materials. The importance of this was, even in Liebig's time,
often overlooked ; and it was, he tells us, more common to find a man who could
make a good analysis than to find one who could produce a pure preparation in

the most judicious way.'

    ' There is no better way of making one's self acquainted with the properties of
a substance than by first producing it from the raw material, then converting it
into its compounds, and so becoming acquainted with them. By the study of
ordinary analysis one does not learn how to use the important methods of crys-

tallisation, fractional distillation, nor acquire any considerable e.xperience in the

proper use of solvents. In short, one does not, as Liebig said, become a

chemist.'

    One reason why the present system of training chemibts has persisted so long

is no doubt that it is a vei'y convenient system : it is easily taught, does not
require expensive apparatus, and, above all, it lends itself admirably for the purpose

of competitive examination.

     The system of examination which has been developed during the last twenty
years has done much harm, and is a source of great difficulty to any conscientious

teacher who is "possessed of originality, and is desirous, particularly in special

cases, of leaving the beaten track.

     In our colleges and universities most of the students work for some definite

-- --examination frequently for the Bachelor of Science degree either at their own

University or at the University of London.
     For such degrees a perfectl}' definite course is prescribed and must be followed,

because the questions which the candidate will have to answer at his examination
are based on a syllabus which is either published or is known by precedent to be
required. The course which the teacher is obliged to teach is thus placed beyond
his individual power of alteration, except in minor details, and originality in the
teacher is thereby discouraged : he knows that all students must face the same

examination, and he must urge the backward man through exactly the same

course as his more talented neighbour.

     In almost all examinations salts' or mixtures of salts are given for qualitative

Aanalysis. ' Determine the constituents of the simple salt and of the mixture B''

is a favourite examination formula ; and as some practical work of this sort is sure-

to be set, the teacher knows that he must contrive to get one and aU of his students

into a condition to enable them to answer such questions.
     If, then, one considers the great amount of work which is required from the

present-day student, it is not surprising that every aid to rapid preparation for

examination should be accepted with delight by the teacher ; and thus it comes

about that tables are elaborated in every detail, not only for qualitative analysis in

inorganic chemistry, but, what is far worse, for the detection of some arbitrary
selection of organic substances which may be set in the syllabus for the examina-
tion. I question whether any really competent teacher will be found to recommend

this system as one of educational value or calculated to bring out and train the

faculty of original thought in students.  s

If, then, the present system is so unsatisfactory, it will naturally be asked,.
                            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                                                                                                                                                                                    691

How are students to be trained, and how are they to be exammed so as to find

 out the extent of the knowledge of their subject which they have acquired?

   --In dealing with the first part of the question tliat is, the training best suited
-- --to chemists I can, of course, only give my own views on the subject views which,

 no doubt, may differ much from those of many of the teachers present at this
meeting. The objects to be attained are, in my opinion, to give the student a

 sufficient knowledge of the broad facts of chemistry, and at tlie same time so to
 arrange his practical work in particular as to always have in view the training of

 his faculty of original thought.

      I think it will be conceded that any student, if he is to make his mark in
 chemistry by original work, must ultimately specialise in some branch of the
subject. It may be possible for some great minds to do valuable original work in
 more than one branch of chemistry, but these are the exceptions ; and as time goes
on, and the mass of facts accumulates, this will become more and more impossible.

Now a student at the commencement of his career rarely knows which branch of

the subject will fascinate him most, and I think, therefore, that it is necessary, in

the first place, to do all that is possible to give him a thorough grounding in all

branches of the subject. In my opinion the student is taken over too much ground

in the lecture courses of the present day : in inorganic chemistry, for example, the
study of the rare metals and their reactions might be dispensed with, as well as

many of the more difficult chapters of physical chemistry, and in organic chemistry
such complicated problems as the constitutions of uric acid and the members of
the camphor and terpene series, &c., might well be left out. As matters stand now,

instruction must be given on these subjects simply because questions bearino- on
them will probably be asked at the examination.

    And here perhaps I might make a confession, in which I do not ask my fellow-
teachers to join me. My name is often attached to chemistry papers which'l should
be sorry to have to answer; and it seems to me the standard of examination

papers, and especially of Honours examinatio3i papers, is fai- too hiffh. Should we
demand a pitch of knowledge which our own experience tells us cannot be main-

tained for long ?

    In dealing with the question of teaching practical chemistry it may be hoped,

in the first place, that in the near future a sound training will be given in ele-

mentary science in most schools, very much on the lines which I mentioned in the
first part of this Address. The student will then be in a fit state to undergo a

thoroughly satisfactory course of training in inorganic chemistry during his first

two years at college. Without wishing in any way to map out a definite course,
I may be allowed to suggest that instead of much of the usual qualitative and

quantitative analysis, practical exercises similar to the foUowiug will be found to

be of much greater educational value.

Bult original papers and to avoid as far as possible any tendency to mere mechanical

work.

The exact nature of such a course must, however, necessarily he left very much

in the hands of the teacher, and the details will no doubt require much considera-

tion ; but I feel sure that a course of practical inorganic chemistry could be con-

structed which, while teaching all the important facts which it is necessary for

the student to know, will, at the same time, constantly tend to develop his faculty of

orio:inal thought.

     Supposing such a course were adopted (and the experiment is well worth trying),

there still remains the problem of how the student who has had this kind of

training is to be examined.

     With regard to his theoretical work there would be no difficulty, as the
examination could be conducted on much the same liues as at the present time.

In the case of the practical examination I have long felt that the only satisfactory
method of arriving at the value of a student's practical knowledge is by the in-
spection of the work which he has done during the whole of his course of studv.

and not by depending on the results of one or two days' set examination. I think
that most examiners will agree with me that the present system of examination in

practical chemistry is highly unsatisfactory. This is perhaps not so apparent in

the case of the qualitative analysis of  the usual simple salt  or mixture                                             but when
                                                                                                                    ;

the student has to do a quantitative exercise, or when a problem is set, the results

sent in are frequently no indication of the value of the student's practical work.

Leaving out of the question the possibility of the student being in indifferent

health during the short period of the practical examination, it not infrequently

happens that he, in his excitement, has the misfortune to upset a beaker when his

quantitative determination is nearly finished, and as a result he loses far more marks

than he should do for so simple an accident.

Again, in attacking a problem he has usually only time to try one method of

solution, and if this does not yield satisfactory results he again loses marks; whereas

in the ordinary course of his practical M'ork, if he were to find that the first
method was faulty he would try other methods until he ultimately arrived at the

desired result.

It is difficult to see why such an unsatisfactory system as this might not be

replaced by one of inspection, which I think could easily be so arranged as to

work well.

   A student taking, say, a three years' course for the degree of Bachelor of

Science might be required to keep very careful notes of all the practical work

which he does during this course, and in order to avoid fraud his notebook could

from time to time be initialled by the professor or demonstrator in charge of the

laboratory. An inspection of these notebooks could then be made at suitable

times by the examiners for the degree, by which means a very good idea would be

obtained of the scope of the work which the student had been engaged in, and if

thought necessary a few questions could easily be asked in regard to the work so

presented. Should the examiners wish to further test the candidate by giving him

an examination, I submit that it would be much better to set him some exercise

of the nature of a simple original investigation, and to allow him two or three

weeks to carry this out, than to depend on the hurried work of two or three

days.

     The object which I had in view in writing this Address was to caU attention

to the fact that our present system of training in chemistry does not appear. >
develop in the student the power of conducting original research, and at the same
time to endeavour to suggest some means by which a more satisfactory state of
things might be brought about. I have not been able, within the limits of this
Address, to consider the conditions of study during the third year of the student's

to the production of more original research by our students, I shall feel that a
useful purpose has been served by bringing this matter before this Section. In
concluding I wish to thank Professor H. B. Dixon, Professor F. S. Kipping, and

others, for many valuable suggestions, and my thanks are especially due to Dr.
Bevan Lean for much information which he gave me in connection with that

2. On some Problems connected ivith Atmospheric Carbonic Anhydride, and

     on a Neio and Accurate Method for determiriing its Amount, suitable

   for Scientific Expeditions. By Professor Letts, D.Sc, Ph.D., <tc.,

    and a. F. Blake, F.I.C, F.C.S., Queerus College, Belfast.

     Attention is drawn to the variations in the amount of atmospheric carbonic
anhydride which correspond with at least 10 per cent, of the total amount, the

causes of which are still to a large extent obscure. In the author's opinion the

subject is an important one, and is worthy of a systematic investigation bv a
number of skilled observers working in different localities and employing tLe same
method of determination which shall have been proved to give results which do
not vary from the true amount by more than three or four parts per million of

air. Among the problems relating to atmospheric carbonic anhydride which

the authors think are specially deserving of attention are the following :

   --1. Is Schloesinfs Theory Correct ? Do the oceans really act as regulators of the

amount of atmospheric carbonic anhydride by the production or dissociation of
earthy bicarbonates according as the amount rises above the normal or falls below
it ? As consequences of this theory latitude should influence the quantity of
atmospheric carbonic anhydride, which ought to be lower in polar than in tropical

localities, and the great ocean currents should also have an effect as they pass from
warmer to colder regions, or the opposite.

  --2. The Infuetice of Day and Night, at Sea. To account for the increased

quantity of atmospheric carbonic anhydride over land surfaces at night, which
most of the observers have found, two theories have been advanced : («) cessation
of plant activity in decomposing the gas owing to the absence of light, and {b) the
streaming out of crouud air from the soil owing to the lowering of temperature.

    At sea no such influences can be exerted, but an absorption of atmospheric
carbonic anhydride may occur at the surface of the water owing to lowering of

temperature, thus reversing the land efiect.

     '6. The Effects of Atmospheric Precipitates, and especially of Snoufall, zvhich

--appears to increase the amount of Atmospheric Carbonic Anhydride. No reason-

able theory has been advanced to account for this curious phenomenon, and it
would be interesting to ascertain whether it occurs at sea as well as on land ; and
the same remark would apply to fog and rain, both of which appear to afiect the
amount also.

Other supposed causes of variation are worth studying, such as the effects of the

seasons, direction and force of the winds, the prevailing type of weather, &c. But

those which the authors think most interesting are such as a scientific mission

would be under peculiarly favourable conditions for observing, and especially the

proposed Antarctic expeditions.

Dublin  Society                                       (vol.  ix.  N.S.,  Part  \i.  No.  15)  a  modification  of Pettenkofer'a

process for determining atmospheric carbonic anliydride is described by means

of which results of great iiccuracy may be obtained. Tims in the final set

of test experiments with artificial mixtures of purified air and carbonic anhydride

in known volumes a mean error (in six detertuinations) of about 1 per cent, of
the gas was found, corresponding with some four parts per million of air taken.

     For use by a scientific expedition it seemed, however, to the authors that a
different process is required in which the operations at the place of observation
should be as simple as possible, and of such a nature as to permit of the actual
determinatioDS being made at any convenient time later, when the resources of a
properly equipped laboratory are available

     The authors hive accordingly devised a method which fulfils these conditions,

and which is simple and accurate. On the one hand it resembles Pettenkofer's

process in that a relatively small volume of air is examined (about six litresj,
while, on the other, Miintz and Aubin's principle is adopted of absorbing the
carbonic anhydride by caustic potash solution and afterwards liberating it by
ebullition in. vacuo with an acid and measuring its volume in a suitable gas

analysis apparatus.

   A series of sealed tubes is prepared in the laboratory, each tube containing an

accurately measured volume of weak potash solution (the amount of combined
carbonic anhydride which such a solution always contains having been ascer-

tained for a given stock).

     The only operations which have to be performed at the place of observation are
the collection of the air sample in a suitable receiver : the transfer of the contents
of one of the sealed tubes to the latter, and after absorption of the atmospheric
carbonic anhydride their retransfer as far as possible to the same tube, which
will be again sealed. The tubes can of course be kept for an indefinite period both
before and after their contents have been thus treated, and the determination of
the absorbed carbonic anhydride made, when convenient, with an aliquot portion
of their contents. The experiments made to test the accuracy of the new method
were satisfactory. Artificial mixtures of purified air and carbonic anhydride in
definite volumes were employed (the two being in about the proportion they occur
in ordinary air). Five determinations in such mixtures gave a mean error of

1"3 per cent, of the carbonic anhydride taken equivalent to four parts per million
of air.

              3. On the Distribution of Chlorine in West Yorkshire.
                           By William Ackroyd, F.I.C.

     The present observations are to be regarded as the preliminaries to an attempt
to construct isochlors for this part of Yorkshire. The subject is one of acknow-

--ledged importance. Professor Mason remarking: 'State maps, such as those

issued for the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut, are most valuable, and th^ir
construction is well worth the expenditure of public money.' ^ Althougli the work

is not far enough advanced for map construction, the figures which follow, and

observations thereon, will be of chemical and hygienic interest during the visit of
the British Association to Bradford.

      In the first place these British normal chlorine figures are very high in com-
parison with the published American data. The lowest Massachusetts figure is
·07 part of CI per 100,000 in the area farthest removed from the Atlantic sea-
border : here the lowest found has been -7 part per 100,000 in the upper reaches
of the Wharf, and all round it appears that the Yorlcshire figures are about ten times
larger than those of the State of Massachusetts, which is to be accounted for
(1) by the closeness of the sea-border on either side to the Pennine range, and (2)
by the density of population in and the antiquity of the inhabited areas.

     The unit isochlor area is coextensive with the highest hills and their becks,
deans and gills. The following chlorine determinations with waters from the

of experience he has iifever learnt of the occurrence of any case of plumhism where

the acidity of the water has been under the equivalent of 0'5 part of sulphuric acid

per lOO-OOO of water, and this he tentatively proposes as a limiting standard of

acidity for potable waters of moorland origin when the acidity is determined

iu the manner already described with phenolphthalein as indicator.

The average acidity of nine samples of water not above suspicion in this

respect was OfiJ, ranging from 0-53 to 0-91 ; while on the other hand sixty-one

samples above reproach from neighbourhoods where plumbism has not been known

had an average acidity of 027, the extremes being 0'20 and 0'41.

                                               5. On the Effects of Copper on the Human Body.
                                                   By ThoiMAs Whiteside Hime, B.A., M.D.

The recrudescence of an agitation by some public analysts as to alleged

danger to health produced by copper has rendered it desirable to make an investi-

gation into the subject, although it was long since satisfactorily disposed of, from

a point of view hitherto scarcely utilised as it deserves, and at the same time to

review the general results attained. The examination of the two principal

excretions, solid and liquid, by which copper is eliminated from the body, offered a

promising means of judging of the effects of the agent, whether merely' swallowed

or also absorbed. These excretions have therefore been examined during a period

of several months, from a number of healthy persons engaged, some for many years,

in dealing with copper, either in smelting works or as workers in its alloys, brass,

&c., or from healthy persons unconnected with any kind of copper work, who had

intentionally swallowed some compound of copper in improperly so-called

' greened ' vegetables (they are not rendered ' green ' by treatment with copper) or

otherwise. Copper was found in relative nbundance in the excretions of all of

these persons, yet they had enjoyed perfect health, and were unconscious of any-

thing abnormal existing in their excretions. It is excreted slowly, and some

weeks may elapse before the whole of the copper-compound ingested is got rid of.

That fact, that copper may, after being swallowed, be absorbed into the blood and

exist there for months, and no doubt during at least twenty years, without indicat-

ing its presence by the slightest interference with health, or indeed in any way

whatever, has thus been established beyond question. In one case, a braes-finisher

aged thirty-eight, who had been thirty years engaged in brass-work, copper was

found on various occasions when sought, during several months. For the last

fourteen years this man has never drawn any money from his sick club, and he

has had perfect health. The copper exists in the excretions, as it dees in coppered

vegetables, not as copper, but as an insoluble compound, which when tested

directly for copper gives no indication of copper being present in any form. As a

fact, no copper is present. It is entirely unjustifiable to speak of copper being a

poison because when combined with some other elements poisonous efl'ects may be

produced by the compound. Because copper and arsenic combined, forming copper

arsenite, which is not copper, is poisonous, a death due to copper arsenite is

reported and quoted for sixty years in all the text-books as due to ' poisoning by

copper !                                       As well call iron a poison, because it too, when combined to form a new-
                                            '

compound, arseniate of iron, may prove poisonous. Copper exists in a great number

of plants, including cereals, mineral waters, wines, shell-fish, fruits, and various kinds

of animal flesh. It has been calculated that a man eating good bread, ' coppered

only by nature, would consume in this way alone some 93 grains of copper,

corresponding to 366 grains of the sulphate. Thousands of wealthy and educated

persons who flock yearly to the health-restoring springs of Wiesbaden, Teplitz,

Pyrmont, &c., consume copper in every glass of water they drink, yet their health

improves, they return yearly to derive fresh benefit, and are unaware that they are

being ' poisoned.' Many trustworthy observers have found copper as a normal
constituent in the human body. That the consumption of vegetables which have

been treated with copper to preserve their natural green is perfectly harmless has
                                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  697

been proved beyond all doubt, not only by such experiments as that of Galippe,

who for fourteen months took copper with his food daily without any ill efi'ect,
and the classic experiments of Lehmann and his pupils on themselves for many

months                                 but by the infinitely larger experiments made yearly by thousands of the
                                    ;

public who consume copper in some form or other in artificially coppered vegetables,

and in their flour, fruit, various kinds of flesh, oysters, crabs, wines, mineral

waters, iS:c. ' coppered ' by nature. Not one case of injury to health under such

circumstances has ever been brought forward, even in prosecutions for selling

' coppered' peas as being ' injurious to health!' The charge is supported by the
allegation ' copper is a poison.' But people who eat * coppered ' vegetables do not
consume ' copper.' The chemical compound of copper they swallow is not copper

at all, and they are not injured. Even verdigris, so much feared, is not all the

dangerous substance alleged. Copper utensils are quite harmless with ordinary

cleanliness. The alleged ' poisonings ' by food cooked in copper vessels have

undoubtedly been mostly, if not all, due to ptomaine-poisoning. Copper has been

known and used longer than any other metal, and in its alloys is the most generally

used of all metallic substances. It has been in use from pi-ehistoric times, and its

dangers, if they existed, must have been known to the ancient and modern world.

Xet the ancients are absolutely .silent on the subject, and among moderns only a

few, almost entirely analysts, declaim to an incredulous public as to dangers which

have not been realised. The alleged fraud in so-called ' greening' of vegetables is

purely imaginary. The copper does not 'green' old peas or make them look

young. Old yellow peas when ' coppered ' still look old and yellow. The quantity

of the copper compound present in the amount of artificially treated vegetables

which is occasionally eaten at a meal is only a fraction of the corresponding

amount of copper sulphate which physicians prescribe to be taken three times a

day for weeks and months continuously. Therefore there is no sufficient ground

for the prohibition of the sale of ' coppered ' vegetables, any more than of the

innumerable kinds of fruits, vegetables, sbell-fish, cereals, mineral waters, wines,

and animal flesh which naturally contain the metal in some form. If the latter

drastic arrangement were attempted, absolute and general starvation would be the

inevitable result, so widely is the natural presence of copper in articles of food

extended.

1. The Specific Heat of Gases at Temperatures up to 400° C.

     By H. B. Dixon, F.R.S., and F. W. Rixox, B.Sc.

The authors have found that the specific heat of gases between 15° C. and

400° C. may be directly measured by heating the gas (under pressure) in a thin

Asteel cyhnder and dropping it into a water calorimeter.           repetition of the

experiment with the steel cylinder empty makes the method a differential one,

eliminating most of the experimental error.

The specific heat of CO^ at constant volume has been thus measured between

15° and 115° C, 192° C, 298° C, and 398° C. The specific heat obtained at

115° agrees closely -with that obtained by Joly under nearly similar conditions.
                     --

The specific beat of CO, is found to rise regularly with the temperature. Varia-

tions in the pressure of the gas produce slight variations in the specific heat.

     The foUowinir values have been obtained by reducing the observed values bv
means of Joly's formula to the same pressure :

under the same conditions -u-ith the same apparatus.

5. The Crystalline Structure of Metals} By J. A.-EwiNG, F.E.S., Professor
     of Mechanism, and Ajjplied Mechanics in the University of C amhridge ;
     and Walter Rosenhain, B.A., St. John's College, Cambridge, 1851

      Exhibition Commissioner's Research Scholar, University of Melbourne.

     The paper describes the results arrived at by the authors in investigating the
effects produced upon the micro-structure of metals by (1) plastic strain, and by
(2) exposure of strained metal to moderate temperatures. After describing and
illustrating the well-known characteristics of crystalline structure in metals as
revealed by the microscope, the authors show that plastic strain is accompanied
by the appearance of minute steps on a surface of the metal which had been plane

polished before the application of the strain. When viewed under the microscope

these steps appear as black lines under normally incident light, but they appear as

bright bands when oblique light of suitable incidence is used. Their observations

lead the authors to conclude that metals yield under plastic strain by the slipping
of the component parts of each crystal along definite cleavage or gliding plane.
The steps in the surface being a consequence of these slips, the authors have called
them 'slip-bands.' Further evidence leads the authors to conclude that plastic
strain in metals occurs without loss of crystalline character, the crystals as a whole

accommodating themselves to new shapes and positions by the slipping of their
elements, with the result that the crystalline structure is preserved even when the
material as a whole undergoes much deformation.

     The use of slip-bands as a means of microscopic observation is also described
and illustrated, more particularly with reference to the occurrence and formation
of twin-crystals in copper, gold, nickel, lead, and other metals. Slip-bands are also
illustrated in various kinds of iron and steel, nickel, zinc, tin, cadmium, lead, silver,
gold, bismuth, and some alloys, the magnifications varying from 40 to 1,000

diameters,

The second part of tlie paper deals with tlie effects of moderate temperatures

(up to 200° 0.) on such metals as lead, zinc, tin, and cadmium. The authors have
found that when these metals are subjected to a very severe plastic strain the

original large crystals are broken up into much smaller ones, without, however,

i destroying their truly crystalline nature. They have further found that when so
           treated these metals readily recrystallise. In' the case of severely strained lead
they have shown that even at the ordinary temperature of a room gradual recrys-

tallisation can be observed in the course of several months, while at higher tem-
Aperatures the changes are much more rapid.
                                                                          freshly strained specimen exposed

to 200° C. was found to recrystallise in a few minutes. It was also found that

severe plastic strain is essential to such recrystallisation, and that minute crystals

obtamed by chilling the metal in casting are not capable of recrystallisation at

such moderate temperatures. Closer observation has shown that this recrystallisa-

tion of strained metal takes place by the growth of certain of the minute crystals

at the expense of their neighbours; individual crystals have been observed to

grow until they were many hundreds of times larger than their neighbours.

     The final section of the paper deals with a theory which one "of the authors
(W. Rosenbain) has advanced as an explanation of these phenomena of annealing.

According to this view, which both authors believe to be correct, the metallic im-

mpurities present in the metal, and forming with it eutectic alloys, play an essential

part these actions. In the ordinary crystallisation of the metal these eutectics
form thin films of intercryjtalline cement, and, according to the theory of the

authors,_ the growth of one crystal at the expense of its neighbour occurs by means

of solution in and diffusion through the eutectic films of the metal constituting the

crystals. Evidence is adduced to show that such ditiusion would be greater in one

direction than the other, and to support the authors' belief that the action may be
electrolytic. As a consequence of this theory the authors were led to make
experiments on the cold welding of lead, and they have found that, as the theory
would indicate, a weld between clean surfaces of lead is a barrier to crystalline

growth, but that such growth readily crosses a weld into which a small amount of

a suitable metallic impurity had been introduced. The authors believe that these

experiments strongly support their ' solution theory ' of annealing.

7. Some neio Chemical Compounds discovered hy the Use of the

These chemical compounds, which were discovered and examined by ]\Ir. Charles
New"B. Jacobs, of
                                                                          York, consist of the alkaline earth silicides of calcium, barium,

or strontium                                                              by a secondary step silico-acetylene is obtained.
                                                                       ;

They have the formula CaSi.,, BaSi,,, and SrSi., respectively, and are the silicon

analogues of the alkaline earth carbides, while the silico-acetylene is the analogue

of acetylene having the formula Si,II., when the carbonates or oxides of the

alkaline earths are mixed with silica in the form of ground quartz or sand, in
which the relative atomic proportion of the alkaline earth metal to the silicon in
the mixture is asl is to 2, and sufficient carbon to effect the reduction is added, or,

when silicates of the alkaline earth metals in which the atomic relation of the
earth metal to the silicon is as 1 to 2, are mixed with sufficient carbon to take up
the oxygen of the compounds present, and heated in the electric furnace under

conditions substantially like those maintained in the manufacture of alkaline earth

carbides, silicides of the alkaline earth metals result.

    As an example of the process the following reactions for the formation of

barium silicide from the barium compounds are given :

     Calcium and strontium silicidea are formed by exactly similar reactions from
similar compounds. They are white or bluish- white substances of metallic appear-
ance, and also resemble aluminium silicide and silicon somewhat in appearance.

     They possess a distinctly crystalline fracture, shewing plate-like crystals very
similar to those seen in the fracture of cast zinc, the crystals being, however, some-
what smaller in size.

     They oxidise slowly in the air and more rapidly under the influence of heat,
yielding silicon dioxide and the oxide of the alkaline earth metals present. Like
the carbides they decompose with water, but yield, instead of acetylene, hydrogen
in a pure state, which is evolved without explosion, the following being the

reaction :

                      (1) CaSio + 6 H,p = Ca (OH)., + 2 SiO,, + lOH
                      (2) BaSi.,' + 6 H,0 = Ba (OH); + 2 SiO," + lOH
                     (3) SrSi; + 6 H:0 = Sr (OH); + 2 SiO: + lOH

The calcium compound dissolves slowly in cold water, but more rapidly in hot

water                                the  barium  compound decomposes  rapidly  in  both     cold  and  hot  water.
                                  ;

The strontium compound dissolves more rapidly in water than the calcium, but

not so rapidly as the barium compound.

     It will be noticed by considering the equations 1, 2 and 3, that all of these

compounds evolve large volumes of hydrogen :--

                                          1 lb. CaSio producing ·1041b, or 18-73 cubic ft. hydrogen

at 0° C. and 760 mm.

Calcium silicide, when treated with dilute acids, either the oxy-acids or the

hydrogen acids, gives rise to the formation of a new compound which has the

formula Si.jHj and is therefore the silicon analogue of acetylene C.,H., and must be

called silico-acetylene since it bears the same relation to silico-methane (silicon

hydride) SiH^ as acetylene bears to methane CH4. The reaction being                                          ·

                                                        CaSi, + 2 IICl = CaClj + Si,H,,

Silico-acetylene is a yellow crystalline compound and differs in properties from the
compound SiHg which Ogier obtained by sparking SiII_, which was unstable and
exploded when subjected to a shock, Si^Ho being stable or non-explosive at

ordinary temperatures.

    When treated with 20 per cent, solution of caustic soda or potash, SioHj

yields hydrogen according to the following equation :

                   OHSioH^ + 4 NaOII -n 2 H^O = 2 Na, SiO,, + 1

Heated in air this compound S'l.Jl^ oxidises rapidly, giving 2 SiOo H.,0, and
when heated in a closed tube it breaks down into amorphous silicon and free
hydrogen. Strontium silicide when treated with a strong acid does not produce
silico-acetylene with the same facility, while the barium compound when so treated
produces a mixture of gaseous compounds and free hydrogen. These silicides can
be produced at low cost where electric power is cheap, are very powerful reducing

agents, and we hope will find large use in the dye industries. Some experiments

have been tried on molten steel carrying phosphorus and sulphur, and the requisite

quantity of silicide of barium or calcium completely removed these impurities as

well as all oxygen present.

  --The following Papers and Reports were read :

   1. Derivatives of Methyl-furfural. Bij Hexry J. HousTMAN Fexton,
                     F.R.8., and Miss Mildred Gostlixg, B.Sc.

    The authors have previously shown that an intense purple colour results when

IcBvulose, cane sugar, sorbose, or inulin is acted upon by dry hydrogen bromide in
ethereal solution. The colour-giving substance was isolated in a crystalline state
and was shown to be bromo-methijl-furfiiral, its formation being characteristic of

ketohexoses, or substances which yield them on hydrolysis. This substance is now

the subject of further investigation, and the following results have so far been

obtained.

    When acted upon by stannous chloride in acid solution the bromine is easily

replaced by hydrogen, and the resulting liquid is identical in every way with
9 methyl-furfural; so that the reaction affords by far the simplest method for the

preparation of the latter substance in a pure state.

     The bromo-compound, when dissolved in appropriate solvents, readily reacts
with various silver salts, giving rise often to beautifully crystalline compounds ;
the acetoxy- and benzoxy-derivatives have, for example, been prepared and
analysed. By the action of sulphurous acid, these, like the parent compound,
yield the remarkable condensation product C,,HgO^, which gives beautiful colour-

reactions with caustic alkalis and with aniline. This condensation-product has
also been further studied, and the results so far favour the author's original
suggestion that it is a dicarbonyl compound.

2. A Simple Method for coinparing the ' Afinities ' of certain Acids. By
    Henry .7. Horstman Fenton, F.H.S., and Humphrey Owen Jones,

      B.A., B.Sc.

Tn a former communication^ the authors have described the isolation and

properties of free oxalacetic acid, and several interesting reactions of this acid are

now being investigated. During a more extended study of the ht/drazone the

following somewhat remarkable behaviour has been observed. Heated with dilute

sulphuric acid it is transformed, as was previously shown,'- into Wislicenus's phenyl-

pyrazolon carboxylic acid (CipHjoNjO^ = Cj^iHgNoOg + H,,0) ; but in order that this

change may be complete it is now found that a certain minimum concentration of

the acid is necessary. When heated with pure water an entirely different result

is obtained : carbon dioxide is evolved, and the fii/drazone of pyruvic acid separates

--in the crystalline state CjoHii3N20^ = (Ji,HjQN203 + C02. If the concentration of

the acid falls below this necessary minimum both reactions occur simultaneously,

even though the acid is present in excess; with decinormal sulphuric acid,

Afor example, about 26 per cent, undergoes the second change.  preliminary set

of observations has been made with the following acids, using deciuormal solutions

and measuring the evolved carbon dioxide in a specially constructed apparatus

hydrochloric, nitric, sulphuric, trichloracetic, tartaric, malic, succinic, citric, acetic.

The results obtained indicate that the amounts of carbon dioxide evolved are in

the inverse order of the concentration of the hydrogen ions, so that a comparison

can be made of the relative ' strengths ' or ' affinities ' of the acids. The order

obtained with the above acids agrees remarkably well with that resultinc from

the other well-estabhshed methods.

      11. On the Direct Preparation of (i-Naphthylamine.
     By Dr. Leoxhard Limpach and W. R. Hodgkinsox.

    On nitrating- naphthalene in the usual manner there results not only a-nitro, hut
also an appreciahle quantity of the ^-derivative, as we have several times proved

by obtaining i3-naphthylamine.

     This note has, of course, a theoretical interest only, as /3-napbthylamine can so

easily be obtained from (S-naphthol by the NHg process under pressure.'

     The nitro-naphthalene obtained by direct nitration of naphthalene is reduced in

the usual way, and the naphthylamine converted into the HCl salt. The hydro-

chloride of a-naphthylamine is comparatively insoluble, whilst the hydrochloride of

the ^-derivative is very soluble. This allows of an easy fractional crystallisation,

Athe mother liquors containing much of the /3-salt.  good method of separation.

consists in treating these mother liquors with potassium hydrate in excess and

steam distilling. The steam distillate, after becoming- solid, or nearly so, is dried
by pressure between paper or on a pump, and then sublimed. |tJ-Naphthylamine

alone sublimes, and can in this manner be obtained quite pure, of melting point

112°, and boiling point 304°, It sublimes in beautiful pearly plates.

The amount of ^-naphthylamine generally contained in the crude, nanhthj'lamine

seems to be about 5 per cent, or under.

AVe have obtained by this method about a liilog. of pure |3-naphthylamine from

technical naphthylamine mother liquors.  \

to form a monohydroxy-furfuraldehyde as the main product, with simultaneous

production of the corresponding' carboxylic acid in small quantity. The substitut-

ing (groups appear to occupy the 1, 2 positions in the ring.

  The  monohydroxy furfural      is  identified, hy its very characteristic relations

_

with phlorogluciiiol and resorcinol, as a constituent of the liguocelluloses.

     Caro's reagent, prepared from potassium persulphate and sulphuric acid,
according to the directions of Baeyer and Yilliger,' reacts under similar conditions
in a different manner. In the first place the reaction appears to be quantitative, and

when the furfural has taken up 0., a trace of either reagent in excess persists.
The temperature remaining at 15'^-20°, and there being no evolution of gas, we may

expect to find a product of empirical formula C-H^,, and as the aldehydic group

disappears this should be a hydropyromucic acid. From tlie isolation and

analysis of a crystalline methylphenyl-hydrazide we confirm the product as a
monocarboxylic acid. On reduction with sodium amalgam an aldehydic product

is obtained with the brilliant colour reactions of the monobydroxyfurfurals.

Control observations on pyromucic acid proved that this acid is reduced under

similar conditions to furfural.

The reactions of this hydroxyfurfural, though similar to those described in our

previous paper, are sufficiently diiierentiated to indicate that we have obtained a

second isomeride. Moreover, the corresponding acids are differentiated, the one
giving Pb

soluble, and, moreover, the acid undergoes hydrolysis with such ease as to make its

isolation in the pure state a matter of great difficulty. In the course of the usual

processes for isolating the Ba and Ca salts, decomposition occurs, and the crystalline

salts isolated are those of a dibasic acid. On boiling the original product in

solution at constant volume, formic acid distils continuously and with traces only

of ether acids. The yield of formic acid amounted in one experiment to 07 grm.

per 1 grm. of original furfural. All these observations indicate that the oriinnal

Aproduct of oxidation is the acid C'^H^O . (COOH) (OH) 1-4 .... characteristic

reaction of this original acid is the production of a yellowish-red precipitate with

ferric chloride, similar to that obtained with pyromucic acid.

     Jt is to be noted that the Garo reagent oxidises the constituent of the
lig^iocelluloses, which gives the brilliant colour reactions with phenols character-

istic of these natural products, which we know to be a hydroxyfurfural. In this

respect the reagent differs from the oxidants ordinarily used for bleaching purposes,
e.^., hypochlorites and permanganates.

   A quantitative experiment with a typical aldose (dextrose) and the Caro reagent

gave a somewhat unexpected, entirely negative result. The cupric reduction
(Fehling solution) was unaffected.

The typical ketose laovulose, on the other hand, is slowly oxidised.
All of these matters are under investigation.

       By Dr. S. Ruhemann and H. E. Stapleton, B.A. (fixon.)

fisetin, and morin, are derived primarily from a phenyl benzo-y-pyrone--

14. On the Combination of Thiophenol and Guaiacol tvith the Esters of
    the Acids of the Acetylene Series. By Dr. S. Ruhemann and H. E.

     Btapleton, B.A. (Oxon.)

     In this paper an account is given of the contini'ation of previous work on the
combination of phenols witli the esters of the acetylene acids. The authors were
induced to study the action of thiophenol on these esters in the hope of finding a

new method of preparing thioacetophenone, whilst the investigation of guaiacol
was taken up, as no derivative of a diliydric phenol had previously been worked

with.

    During the progress of the research various new derivatives of thiophenyl-

cinnamlc, fumaric, and succinic acids were discovered, but it was found that

thiophenyl styrene

on boiling with dilute mineral acids is decomposed into acetophenone and
 hiopheuol, and not into thioacetophenone and phejiol, as had been expected.

    Guaiacol was found to combine readily with phenyl propiolic ester; guaiacolyl
cinnamic acid and its ester were prepared, and it was found that the acid on
heating quantitatively decomposed into carbon dioxide and guaiacolyl styrene

     3. Injluence of Pressure on the Formation of Oceanic Salt Deposits,

                          By H. M. Dawson, Ph.D., B.Sc.

     The present paper forms one of a series of investijrations carried out with a
view of obtaining information in regard to the conditions of formation of the

ytassfiirt deposits.

      In previous papers (van't Hoff and pupils) the isothermal equilibrium relation-
ships of salts occurring in sea-water and the intluence of temperature on these
has been investigated. This paper deals with the influence of pressure.

     One of the last phases of salt deposition in the Stassfurt layer is represented
by tachhydrite (CaCl., SMgCl, li'H.,0) ; experiment shows that this separates

from solutions of the mixed chloride of Ca and Wg if the temperature exceeds

22°-4 C.

     Below 22°'4 C. a mixture of the simple salts separates, but no tachhydrite. If
the mixed chlorides be heated in the solid condition, then at 22° 4 C. water is
split off and tachhydrite is formed.

     The influence of pressure on the temperature of formation of this double salt
has been studied.

     Careful determinations by the thermometric method show that under atmo-

spheric pressure this tearperature is 22°'400 C.

     By means of the manokryometer the temperature of formation under higher

pressures was determined.
     The mean result of this direct determination of the influence of pressure is

that for an increase of 100 atmospheres the temperature of formation is raised
1°-02C.

     Another and indirect determination is possible by applying the formula of
Thomson for the influence of pressure on the melting point to the trausiiion
temperarure at which calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, tachhydrite, and
saturated solution are in equilibrium. From the formula in question, viz.,

words, ]00 atmospheres would raise the temperature of formation l°-o.5 C.

Both results show tljat the influence of pressure on the separation of salts

from solution is very small in comparison with the influence of temperature.

On thermodynamic grounds it can be shown that the influence of jjressure on

temperature displacement in the case of other salts must be of the same order of

magnitude as that found in the case of tachhydrite.

 temperature of 25" C. cannot he attributed to the influence of the pressure whicli
 lias existed during the natural salt deposition, but must be accounted for by

 the prevalence of higher temperatures. The presence of these salts in the
 Stassfurt layer enables us, in fact, to draw conclusions in regard to the tempera-
 tures which existed during the salt deposition.

                    By Major-General J. Waterhouse, I.S.C.

     The paper is a continuation of that read before the Royal Society on May 31,

 and contains an account of further experiments on the production of visible
photographic images upon plain silver surfaces by the action of solar radiation^.

     The author has found that such visible images are formed when pure silver

foils or silvered glass are exposed to sunlight in exhausted glass tubes, and,
apparentlv, more readily in the presence of watery vapour. Invisible, but develop-
able, images were readily obtained in exhausted tubes in which no signs of the

presence of moisture were apparent. By prolonged exposure a visible change

also takes place.

     AVhen thin films of silver on glass have been fully exposed in sunlight the
action has been found to penetrate the film and produce a distinctly visible image
at the back as well as on the face, the exposed parts appearing always lighter than

the unexposed.
      Fresh experiments with silver plates used as anode and cathode in a decom-

position cell containing distilled water, through which a weak current was allowed
to pass, showed that the pale grey deposit on the cathode and the dark olive
yellow coating on the anode were both quite sensitive to light, and appeared
lighter by exposure, in a manner somewhat analogous to that observed on silvered

glass or plain silver foils exposed to light.

     It was noticed that the visible images were not dissolved away either by the
usual photographic hxing agents or by dilute nitric acid.

    A very curious action of li^ht upon glass has also been observed. In this

case a silvered glass plate was exposed for about a month under a cut-out screen
of thin aluminium, the unsilvcred side of the glass being in contact with the
aluminium and not protected from the air by a covering glass plate. After
exposure the plate was put aside for a few days with the exposed glass side in
contact with the silvered surface of another piece of polished silvered glass, which
was then found to have received an impressed image from the glass of the design
cut out of the aluminium screen. 'I'he image was quite visible, clear and sliarp,
and somewhat similar to the images directly impressed by light, though it had not
the same appearance of being bleached out, when examined by reHected light.
Several days afterwards a second similar image was produced in the same way by
contact with the glass upon another freshlj' polished silvered glass plate, and no
doubt several more could be produced in the same way.

     These new experiments seem to show that the images formed by the action of
light upon plain silver surfaces are due more to molecular or physical changes than
to chemical decomposition, though the latter may also probably come into play in

the presence of watery vapour, or other conditions favouring oxidation and reduction
of the metallic surface. The author is continuing the investigation.

          5. Some Thoughts on Atomic Weights and the Periodic Law.

       By J. H. Gladstone, D.Sc.^ F.R.S., and George Gladstone,

     The object of this paper w'as to recall attention to a suggestion made during the
discussion of a paper by Professor Dumas at the meeting otthe Association at Ipswich
in 1851, viz., that the case of ' triads' of analogous elements showed a resemblance
to the progression in a series of organic compounds, and might be due to a similar
cause. It was shown that the ditlerence in atomic weight between the horizontal
lines in Mendeljeff's arrangement is in the lirst instance 16, which afterwards
TRANSACTIOXS OF SECTION B.                                                 07

changes to about 20, and ultimately to about 24. But tbis increment is
really arrived at by 8 steps, giving in the tirst instance an average of 2'0 for each

element ; iu point of fact, however, the increments are not regular, being for the

first line, and starting with lithium, 2-1, 1-9, 1-0, 2-0, 2'0, 30, and then 4-0 for two
steps, the intermediate one being unknown. This departure from regularity in the
increment seems to show that it is of a compound nature ; that the original
substance may run through the whole series, but be modified by small quantities
of one or more additional substances. This would seem to explain not only the
slight irregularities, but how our place in Mendeljetf's arrangement may be occupied
by two or more elements which closely resemble one another, but differ very
slightly in atomic weight or in other properties, such as the iron group, the plati-

num group, the two didymiums, and the metals associated with yttrium. On this
supposition the elements having high atomic weights may be expected to be loss

regular than is the case in the earlier part of the series.

6. The Heating and Lighting Potcer of Coal Gas.

          By T. Fairley, F.R.S.E., F.LC.

     The author pointed out the importance of knowing the heating power of gas
as well as the lighting power, now that it is so largely used for heating and

engine purposes.

     Coal gas is a complex mixture consisting chiefly of marsh gas and hydrogen
with small quantities of heavy hydrocarbous, oxides of carbon, aqueous vapour,
nitrogen, itc. The first two control mainly the heating value, and the heavy
hydrocarbons the lighting value in ordinary burners. Incandescent gas-burners

are not considered in this paper.

     That heavy hydrocarbon vapours raise the lighting more than the beating

power, explains why carburetted water-gas has a less heating value than ordinary

coal-gas of the same lighting power. Air or nitrogen drawn into gas lowers the
lighting power more than the heating power.

    In gas made from one kind of coal the calorimeter may be worked constantly

so as to watch the gas in place of the jet photometer.
     The author referred to the various calorimeters invented, and gave directions

for securing accuracy. Finally he gave a table of average results showing the
heating power of gas of different lighting power.

gallons from ^lessrs. Lister's, of Manningbam Mills. Frooi experiments upon

bulks of 20,000 gallons, a mixture of one part of wool-suds and seven parts of

Bradford Sunday sewage requires nine times as much precipitant, and produces

ten times as much wet and twelve and a half times as much settled sludge, as the
ASunday sewage alone.
                                                                                                  number of the woolcombera recover part of the wool-

grease by 'cracking' the crude suds with oil of vitriol. The effluent so obtained

is very acid, contains from 100 to L'OO grains of grease per gallon, with a very

large amount of nitrogenous impurities. The difficulties arising from the pre-

sence of the wool-suds and effluents are twofold: (1) The peculiar emulsive

character  of wool-grease                                                                         (2) the excessive amount of  nitrogenous impurities.
                                                                                               ;

"With Bradford sewage have been tried :

     (1) Lime, giving a clear but bad effluent with a large amount of sludge.
     (2) Copperas, followed by lime, producing a lurbid but better effluent.
     (3) Alumina-ferric, i.e., alumina sulphate, giving unsatisfactory results at a

high cost.

     (4) Acid ferric sulphate, giving a high degree of purification, but with an

acid effluent.

     (")) Neutral ferric sulphate, yielding as good results, but with less acidity.
     (6) Basic ferric sulphate, giving a 02 per cent, purification and a neutral or

slightly alkaline effluent.'

     The basic sulphate is made at the sewage works by McCulloch's Patent. As
it is necessary to use a considerable weight of the basic salt, the method proves

 costly.

      The author has fully investigated the biology of Bradford sewage, and has
tried diflerent methods of bacterial treatment. It has not been very difficult to
get nitrification with as high a purification in extreme cases as 70 per cent.

     The grease present to the extent of 40 to 50 grains per gallon very soon
chokes up the filters. There can be no doubt that if the woolcombers' euds and
effluents were entirely removed the whole of the city's sewage could be
treated biologically, with an immense saving in the cost of chemicals and the

treatment of the sludge. Failing the elimination of the wool-suds the best

method would seem to be a preliminary treatment with the cheapest precipitant
obtainable and the biological purification of the efiluent, either on bacteria beds or
on land, preferably on both.

     Several patentees have experimented on Bradford sewage, but hitherto with
unsatisfactory results, and they have all retired from the attempt, saying that the
grease baffled them.

     After describing the chemical and biological methods in detail, the author
entered at some length into the scientific causes of the difficulties of treatment.

After criticising the existing mpthous for determining the dissolved oxygen in

the purpose, of which the following is an outline

An ordinary separating funnel is filled with the water to be examined, and a

--together corresponding with that of the water removed and the stopper of tho

 funnel is then inserted, care being taken that no air bubbles are enclosed.

     AVithin the separating funnel there is now a layer of ferrous sulphate below,

next the water, and above all the ammonia. These are mixed by inverting the
vessel once or twice by a swinging motion, when a greenish turbid mi.Kture result.'s,
which rapidly darkens as the dissolved oxygen is absorbed. After fifteen minutes
 the vessel (still stoppered) is inverted, and its tube or lower extremity (now. Low-
ever, the upper one) is nearly tilled with a mixture of equal volumes of sulphuric
acid and water. The tap is then opened, when the acid flows downwards into
the alkaline mixture, and in the course of a few minutes dissolves the iron hydrates,
forming a clear solution. This is then run off into a porcelain dish, and there
titrated, either with permanganate or bichromate, conveniently of the strength
1 c.c. = 1 c.c. of dissolved oxygen at N.T.P.

      In the authors' experiment the separating funnel had a capacity of o32'o c.c,

practically ^ litre ; and its tube contained, when nearly full, about 8 c.c. of
diluted sulphuric acid. About 7 c.c. of the water was removed, 5 c.c. of standard
ferrous sulphate solution added and about 2 c.c. of strong ammonia. The ferrous

sulphate solution contained about 12 s-rams of the crystallised salt in 250 c.c. of
distilled water. It was standardised for each determination by titrating 5 c.c. in
a porcelain basin, mixed with the same volume of the water under examination as
employed in the dissolved oxygen determination and the same volume of acid.

     For all practical purposes the dissolved oxygen contained in the volume of
water which the separating funnel holds amounts to the dill'erence between tho
burette readings for the blank experiment and for the actual determination. The
following are a few typical results :

     These specially enriched sludges, whan dried and ground, formed excellent
manures, giving results equal to those produced by many high-priced artificial
manures. The experiments show that for the effective utilisation of sewage sludge
as a manure there are two requisites :

     1. The use of some such phosphatic material as Phosalite when pressing the

sludge.

    2. Tlie resultant sludge-cake must then be dried and ground, so that it may

easily mix with the soil.

   THVItSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.

The President delivered the following Address :--

   Evolutional Geology.

The close of one century, the dawn of another, may naturally suggest some hrief

retrospective glance over the path along which our science has advanced, and some

general survey of its present position from which we may gather hope of its

future progress ; but other connection with geology the beginnings and end-
ings of centuries have none. The great periods of movement have hitherto begun,
as it were, in the early twilight hours, long before the dawn. Thus the iirst step
forward, since which there has been no retreat, was taken by Steno in the year

1669 more than a century elapsed before James Hutton (17S5) gave fresh energy;

and better direction to the faltering  steps of  the  young science                                                         while  it was less
                                                                                                                         ;

than a century later (18G-3) when Lord Kelvin brought to its aid the powers of the
higher mathematics and instructed it in the teachings of modern physics. From

Steno onward tbe spirit of geology was catastrophic ; from Hutton onward it

grew increasingly uniformitarian ; from the time of Darwin and Kelvin it has

become evolutional. The ambiguity of the word ' uniformitarian ' has led to a

good deal of fruitless logomachy, against which it may be as well at once to guard
by indicatino- the sense in which it is used here In one way we are all uniformi-

tarians, z.e., we accept the doctrine of the ' uniform action of natural causes,' but,

as applied to geology, uniformity means more than this. Defined in the briefest
fashion it is the geology of Lyell. Plutton had given us a ' Theory of the Earth,'

in its main outlines still faithful and true ; and this Lyell spent his life in illustrating

and advocating ; but as so commonly happens the zeal of the disciple outran the
wisdom of the master, and mere opinions were insisted on as necessary dogma.

AVhat did it matter if Hutton as a result of his inquiries into terrestrial history

had declared that he found no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end ? It

would have been marvellous if he had ! Consider that when Hutton's ' Theory

was published William Smith's famous discovery had not been made, and that

nothing was then known of the orderly succession of forms of life, which it is one

of the triumphs of geology to have revealed ; consider, too, the existing state of

physics at the time, and "that the modern theories of energy had still to be for-

mulated consider also that spectroscopy had not yet lent its aid to astronomy
                                              ;

and the consequent ignorance of the nature of    nebulae                                and then, if you                           will, cast
                                                                                     ;

a stone at Hutton. With Lyell, however, the case was different : in pressing his

uniformitarian creed upon geology he omitted to take into account the great

advances made by its sister sciences, althoiio'li he bad knowledge of tbem, and

thus sinned a>rainst tbe ligbt. In tbe last edition of the famous · Principles ' we
read : ' It is a favourite dogma of some pbysicists that not only the earth, but the

sun itself, is continually losing a portion of its heat, and tliat as there is no known
source by which it can be restored we can foresee the time when all life will cease

to exist on this planet, and on the other hand we can look back to a period when

tbe heat was so intense as to be incompatible with the existence of any organic

Abeings such as are icnown to us in the living or fossil world. ... geologist in

search of some renovating power by which the amount of heat may be made to

continue unimpaired for millions of years, past and future, in the solid parts of the

earth . . . has been compared by an eminent physicist to one who dreams he

can discover a source of perpetual motion and invent a clock with a self-winding
apparatus. But zvhij should we despair of detecting proofs of such regenerating

and self-sustaining power in the %vorks of a Divine Artificer ? ' Here we catch the

true spirit of unifoimity ; it admittedly regards the universe as a self-winding

clock, and barely conceals a conviction that the clock was warranted to keep

true Greenwich time. The law of the dissipation of energy is not a dogma, but a

doctrine drawn from observation, while the uniformity of Lyell is in no sense an
induction : it is a dogma in the narrowest sense of the word, unproved, incapable

of proof ; hence perhaps its power upon the human mind ; hence also the transi-

toriness of that power. Again, it is only by restricting its inquiries to the stratified

rocks of our planet that the dogma of uniformity can be maintained with any pretence
of argument. Directly we begin to search the heavens the possibility, nay even

the likelihood, of the nebular origin of our system, with all that it involves, is

borne in upon us. Lypll therefore consistently refused to extend his gaze beyond

the rocks beneath his feet, and was thus led to do a serious injury to our science:

he severed it from cosmogony, for which he entertained and expressed the most

profound contempt, and from the mutilation thus inflicted geology is only at length

Whymaking a slow and painful recovery.                               do I dwell on these facts? To

depreciate Lyell? By no means. No one is more conscious than I of the noble

service whicb Lyell rendered to our cause : his reputation is of too robust a kind

myto sutler from  unskilful handling, and the iame of bis solid contributions to

science will endure long after these controversies are forgotten. The echoes of

the combat are already dying away, and uniformitarians, in the sense already

defined, are now  no  more                             indeed, were  I to attempt to exhibit any distinguished
                                                    ;

living geologist as a still surviving supporter of the narrow Lyellian creed, he

would probably feel, if such a one there be, that I was unfairly singling him out

for unmerited obloqu}'.

Our science has become evolutional, and in the transformation has grown

more comprehensive : her petty parochial days are done, she is drawing her pro-

vinces closer around her, and is fusing them together into a united and single com-

--monwealfh the science of the earth.

Not merely the earth's crust, but the whole of earth-knowledge is the sub-

ject of our research. To know all that can be known about our planet, this, and

nothing less than this, is its aim and scope. From tbe morphological side geology

inquires not only into tbe existing form and structure of the earth, but also into the

series of successive morphological states through which it has passed in a long

and changeful development. Our science inquires also into the distribution of

the earth in time and space ; on the physiological side it studies the movements

and activities of our planet ; and not content with all this it extends its researches

into aetiology and endeavours to arrive at a science of causation. Li these pursuits

geology calls all the other sciences to her aid. In our commonwealth there are no

outlanders ; if an eminent physicist enter our territory we do not begin at once

to prepare for war, because the very fact of his undertaking a geological inquiry of

Aitself confers upon him all the duties and privileges of citizenship.  physicist

studying geology is by definition a irenlogist. Our only regret is, not that physi-

cists occasionally invade our borders, but that they do not visit us ofteuer and

ipake closer acquaintance with us.

                   Early History of the Earth: First Critical Period.

     If I am bold enough to assert tliat cosmogony is no longer alien to geology, I
may proceed fm-tlier, and taking advantage of my temerity pass on to speak of

things once not permitted to us. I propose therefore to oiler some short account of

the early stages in the history of the earth. Into its nebular origin we need not

--inquire that is a subject for astronomers. AVe are content to accept the infant

earth from their hands as a molten globe ready made, its birth from a gaseous

nebula duly certified. If we ask, as a matter of curiosity, what was the origin of
the nebula, I fear even astronomers cannot tell us. There is an hypothesis which

refers it to the clashing of meteorites, but in the form in which this is usually

presented it does not help us much. Such meteorites as have been ob.served (o
penetrate our atmosphere and to fall on to the surface of the earth prove on

examination to have had an eventful history of their own of which not the least
important chapter was a passage through a molten state; they would thus appear

to be the products rather than the progenitors of a nebula.

    We commence our history then with a rapidly rotating molten planet, not

impossibly already solidified about the centre and surrounded by an atmosphere
of great depth the larger part of which was contributed by the water of our
present oceans, then existing in a state of gas. This atmosphere, which exerted a
pressure of something like 5,000 lb. to the square inch, must have played a very
important part in the evolution of our planet. The molten exterior absorbed it to

an extent which depended on the pressure, and which may some day be learnt
from experiment. Under the influence of the rapid rotation of the earth
the atmosphere would be much deeper in equatorial than polar regions, so

that in the latter the loss of heat by radiation would be in excess. This might of
itself lead to convectional currents in the molten ocean. The effect on the atmo-

sphere is very difficult to trace, but it is obvious that if a high-pressure area
originated over some cooler region of the ocean, the winds blowing out of it would

drive before them the cooler superficial layers of molten material, and as these
were replaced by hotter lava streaming from below, the tendency would be to
convert the high into a low pressure area, and to reverse the direction of the
winds. Conversely under a low-pressure area the in-blowing winds would

drive in the cooler superficial layers of molten matter that had been swept away

from the anticyclones. If the diflerence in pressure under the cyclonic and anti-
cyclonic areas were considerable, some of the gas absorbed under the anticyclone8
might escape beneath the cyclones, and in a later stage of cooling might give rise
to vast floating islands of scoria. Such islands might be the first foreshadowiugs
of the future continents. Whatever the ultimate effect of the reaction of the
winds on the currents of the molten ocean, it is probable that some kind of
circulation was set up in the latter. The universal molten ocean was by no means
homogeneous: it was constantly undergoing changes in composition as it reacted
chemically with the internal metallic nucleus : its currents would streak the
difierent portions out in directions which in the northern hemisphere would
run from N.E. to S.AV., and thus the differences which distinguish particular

petrological regions of our planet may have commenced their existence at a very
early stage. Is it possible that as our knowledge extends we shall be able by a
study of the distribution of igneous rocks and minerals to draw some conclusions
as to the direction of these hypothetical lava currents? Oixr planet was pro-
foundly disturbed by tides, produced by the sun ; for as yet there was no moon

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and it has been suggested that one of its tidnl waves rose to a height so great as
to sever its connection with the earth and to fly off as the infant moon. This

event may be regarded as marking the first critical period, or catastrophe if we

please, in the history of our planet. The career of our satellite, after its escape
from the earth, is not known till it attained a distance of nine terrestrial radii
after this its progress can be clearly followed. At the eventful time of parturition
the earth was rotating, with a period of from two to four hours, about an
axis inclined at some 11° or 12° to the ecliptic. The time which has elapsed

since tbe moon occupied a position nine terrestrial radii distant from the eartli is

Professor Darwin's story of the moon is certainly one of the most beautiful
contributions ever made by astronomy to geology, and we shall all concur with

Ahim when he says, ' theory reposing on verce causa, which brings into quanti-

tative correlation the length of the present day and month, the obliquity of the

ecliptic, and the inclinatiou and eccentricity of the lunar orbit, must, I think,

have strong claims to acceptance.'

    The majority of geologists have long hanlcered after a metallic nucleus for the

earth, composed' chiefly, by analogy with meteorites, of iron. Lord Kelvin has

--admitted the probable existence of some such nucleus, and lately Professor Wiechert

has furnished us with arguments ' powerful' arguments Professor Darwin terms

--them in support of its existence. The interior of the earth for four fifths of

the radius is composed, according to Professor Wiechert, chiefly of metallic

iron, with  a   density of                    8'2                   tlie outer envelope, one  fifth of  the I'adius, or about
                                                                 ;

400 miles in thicljuess, consists of silicates, such as we are familiar with in

igneous rocks and meteorites, and possesses a density of 3'2. It was frorn this

outer envelope when molten that the moon was trundled oft", twenty-seven miles in

depth going to its formation. The density of this material, as we have just seen,

is supposed to be 3-2; the density of the moon is o-.39, a close approximation,

such difference as exists being completely explicable by the comparatively low

temperature of the moon.

    The outer envelope of the earth which was drawn off to form the moon was,

as we have seen, charged with steam and other gases under a pressure of 5,000 lb.

to  the square  inch                     but  as                    the  satellite wandered  away from the  parent planet
                                      ;

this pressure continuously diminished. Under these circumstances the moon

would become as explosive as a charged bomb, steam would burst forth from

numberless volcanoes, and while the face of the moon might thus have ac-

quired its existing features the ejected material might possibly have been shot

so far away from its origin as to have acquired an independent orbit. If so we
may ask whether it may not be possible that the meteorites, which sometimes
descend upon our planet, are but portions of its own envelope returniug to it. The

facts that the average specific gravity of those meteorites which have been seen to

fall is not much above 3'2, and that they have passed through a state of fusion,

are consistent with this suggestion.

                     Second Critical Period. ' Consistentior Status.'

     The solidification of the earth probably became completed soon after the birth
of the moon. The temperature of its suriace at the time of consolidation was about
1170° C, and it was therefore still surrounded by its primitive deep atmosphere of
steam and other gases. This was the second critical period in the history of the
earth, the stage of the ' consistentior status,' the date of which Lord Kelvin would
rather know than that of the Norman Conquest, though he thinks it lies between
twenty and forty millions of years ago, probably nearer twenty than forty.

    Now that the crust was solid there was less reason why movements of the

atmosphere should be unsteadv, and deflnite regions of high and low pressure
might have been established. Under the high-pressure areas the surface of the
crust would be depressed ; correspondingly under the low-pressure areas it would
be raised; and thus from the first the surface of the solid earth might be dimpled

and embossed.^

                       TJiird Critical Period. Origin of the Oceans.

     The cooling of the earth would continuously progress, till the temperature of
the surface fell to 370° C, when that part of the atmosphere which consisted of
steam would begin to liquefy; then the dimples on the surface would soon

of these inequafities, but it may be pointed out that the moon is possibly responsible,
and that in more ways than one, for much of the existing geographical asymmetry.

become filled with superheated water, and the pools so formed would expand and

deepen, till they formed the oceans. This is the third critical stage in the history of

theearth,datiDg:,accordingtoProfessorJoly, from hetween eighty and ninety millions

--of years ago. With the growth of the oceans the distinction between land and sea

arose in what precise manner we may proceed to inquire. If we revert to the
period of the ' consistentior status,' when the earth had just solidified, we shall

find, according to Lord Kelvin, that the temperature continuously increased from
the surface, where it was 1170° C, down to a depth of twenty-five miles, where

it was about 1430° C, or 260° C. above the fusion poiut of the matter forming

the crust. That the crust at this depth was not molten but solid is to be explained

--by the very great pressure to which it was subjected ^^just so much pressure,

indeed, as was required to counteract the influence of the additional 260° C. Thus

if we could have reduced the pressure on the crust we should have caused it to

liquefy ; by restoring the pressure it would resolidify. By the time the earth's
surface had cooled down to 370°C. the depth beneatli the surface at which the

pressure just kept the crust solid would have sunk some slight distance inwards,

but not sufficiently to affect our argument.

The average pressure of the primitive atmosphere upon the crust can readily

be calculated by supposing the water of the existing oceans to be uniformly

distributed over the earth's surface, and then by a simple piece of arithmetic

determining its depth: this is found to be 1'718 miles, the average depth of the

oceans beinsr taken at 2-393 miles. Thus the average pressure over the earth s

surface, immediately before the formation of the oceans, was equivalent to that of

a column of water 1'718 miles high on each square inch. Supposing that at its

origin the ocean were all ' gathered together into one place,' and ' the dry land

appeared,' then the pressure over the ocean floor would be increased from 1'71S miles

to 2-393 miles, while that over those portions of the crust that now formed the land

would be diminished by 1-718 miles. This difference in pressure would tend to

exaggerate those faint depressions which had arisen under the primitive anti-

cyclonic areas, and if the just solidified material of the earth's crust were set into

a state of flow it might move from under the ocean into the bulgings which were

rising to form the land, until static equilibrium were establi.'-hed. Under these

circumstances the pressure of the ocean would be just able to maintain a column

of rock 0-886 mile in height, or ten twenty-sevenths ol its own depth. It could do no

more                         but in order that the  dry land may  appear some  cause must be found  com-
                          ;

petent either to lower the ocean bed the remaining seventeen twenty-sevenths of its

full depth or to raise the continental bulgings to the same extent. Such a cause may,

I think, be discovered in a further efl'ect of the reduction in pressure over the con-

tinental areas. Previous to the condensation of the ocean these, as we have seen,

were subjected to an atmospheric pressure equal to that of a column of water

1'718 miles in height. This pressure was contributor}' to that which caused the

outer twenty-five miles of the earth's crust to become solid ; it furnished indeed

just about one fortieth of that pressure, or enough to raise the fusion point

6° C. "What then might be expected to happen when the continental area was

relieved of this load ? Plainly a liquefaction and corresponding expansion of the

underlying rock.

    But we will not go so far as to assert that actual liquefaction would result ; all
we require for our explanation is a great expansion : and this would probably

follow whether the crust were liquefied or not. For there is good reason to
suppose that when matter at a temperature above its ordinary fusion point is

compelled into the solid state by pressure, its volume is very responsive to changes

either of pressure or temperature. The remarkable expansion of liquid carbon

--dioxide is a case in point : 120 volumes of this fluid at 20° C. become 150 volumes

Aat 33° C. ; a temperature just below the critical point.                      great change of volume

also occurs when the material of igneous rocks passes from the crystalline state to

that of glass ; in the case of diabase ^ the difl'erenee in volume of the rock in the two

states at ordinary temperatures is 13 per cent. If tlie relief of pressure over the

site of continents were accompanied by volume changes at all approaching this,

the additional elevation of seventeen twenty-sevenths required to raise the land to

Howthe sea-level would be accounted for.'      far down beneath the surface the

unloading of the continents would be felt is difficult to say, though the problem

is probably not beyond the reach of mathematical analysis; if it affected an outer

envelope twenty-five miles in thickness, a linear expansion of R per cent, would

suffice to explain the origin of ocean basins. If now we refer to the dilatation

determined by Carl Barus for rise in temperature in the case of diabase, we

find that between 1093° and 1112° C. the increase in volume is 3-3 per cent. As

a further factor in deepening the ocean basins may be included the compressive

effect of the increase in load over the ocean floor : this increase is equal to the

pressure of a column of water 0-(i75 mile in height, and its effect in raising the

fusion point would be 2° C, from which we may gain some kind of idea of the

amount of compression it might produce on the yielding interior of the crust. To

admit that these views are speculative will be to confess nothing ; but they certainly

account for a good deal. They not only give us ocean basins, but basins of the
kind we want, that is, to use a crude comparison once made by the late

Dr. Carpenter, basins of a tea-tray form, having a somewhat flat floor and

steeply sloping sides ; they also help to explain how it is that the value of gravity

is greater over the ocean than over the land.

The ocean when first formed would consist of highly heated water, and this,

as is well known, is an energetic chemical reagent when brought into contact

with silicates like those which formed the primitive crust. As a result of its action

saline solutions and chemical deposits would be formed ; the latter, however,
would probably be of no great thickness, for the time occupied by the ocean in

cooling to a temperature not far removed from the present would probably be

included within a few hundreds of years.

    The course of events now becomes somewhat obscure, but sooner or later the

familiar processes of denudation and the deposition started into activity, and have

continued acting uninterruptedly ever since. The total maximum thickness of

     ' Professor Fitzgerald has been kind enough to express part of the preceding

explanation in a more precise manner for me. He writes : ' It would require a very
nice adjustment of temperatures and pressures to work out in the simple way you

state it ; but what is really involved is that in a certain state diabase (and everything
that changes state with a considerable change of volume) has an enormous isothermal
compressibility. Although this is very enormous in the case of bodies which melt
suddenly, like ice, it would also involve very great compressibilities in the case
of bodies even which melted gradually, if they did so at all quickly, i.e., within a
small range of temperature. What you postulate, then, is that at a certain depth
diabase is soft enough to be squeezed from under the oceans, and that, being near its
melting point, the small relief of pressure is accompanied by an enormous increase

in volume which helped to raise the continents. Now that I have written the thing
out in my own way it seems very likely. It is, anyway, a suggestion quite worthy

of serious consideration, and a process that in some places must almost certainly
have been in operation, and maybe is still operative. Looking at it again, I
hardly think it is quite likely that there is or could be much squeezing sideways of
liquid or other viscous material from under one place to another, because the
elastic yielding of the inside of the earth would be much quicker than any flow of
this kind. This would only modify your theory, because the diabase that expands
so much on the relief of pressure might be that already under the land, and raising
up this latter, partly by being pushed up itself by the elastic relief of the inside of
the earth and partly by its own enormous expansibility near its melting point. The
action would be quite slow, because it would cool itself so much by its expansion
that it vjould have to be warmed up from below, or by tidal earth-squeezing, or by
chemical action before it could expand isotheripally,'

Separation of the earth and moon, fifty-six millions of years, minimum estimate by

Professor G. H. Darwin. (2) Since the ' consistentior status,' twenty to forty

millions (Lord Kelvin). (3) Since the condensation of the oceans, eighty to

ninety millions, maximum estimate by Professor J. Joly.

It may be at once observed that these estimates, althougli independent, are all

of the same order of magnitude, and so far confirmatory of each other. Nor are
they opposed to conclusions drawn from a study of stratified rocks; thus Sir

Archibald Geilde, in his Address to this Section last year, alfirmed tliat, so far as

these -were concerned, 100 millions of years might suffice for their formation.

There is then very little to quarrel about, and our task is reduced to an attempt,

by a little stretching and a little paring, to bring these various estimates into

closer harmony.

Professor  Darwin's  estimate  is admittedly a minimum                                                                                                                       tlie actual time, as he

himself expressly states, ' may have been much longer.' Lord Kelvin's estimate,

which he would make nearer twenty than forty millions, is founded on the

assumption that since the period of the ' consistentior status ' the earth lias cooled

simply as a solid body, the transference of heat from within outwards having been

accomplished solely by conduction.

It may be at once admitted that there is a large amount of truth in this

assumption ; there can be no possible doubt that the earth reacts towards forces

applied for a short time as a solid body. Under the influence of the tides it behaves

as though it possessed a rigidity approaching tliat of steel, and under sudden blows,

such as those which give rise to earthquakes, with twice this rigidity, as Professor

Milne informs me. Astronomical considerations lead to the conclusion that its

etfective rigidity has not varied greatly for a long period of past time.

  -- --Still, wliile fully recognising these facts, the geologist knows we all know that

the crust of the earth is not altogether solid. The existence of volcanoes by

itself suggests the contrarj% and although the total amount of fluid material which

--is brought from the interior to the exterior of the earth by volcanic action may be,

and certainly is, small from data given by Professor Penck, I estimate it as

equivalent to a layer of rock imiformly distributed 2 mm. thick per century '

vet we have every reason to believe that volcanoes are but the superficial manifesta-

tion of far greater bodies of molten material which lie concealed beneath the

ground. Even the wide areas of plutonic rock, which are sometimes exposed to

view over a country that has suffered long-continued denudation, are merely the

upper portion of more extensive masses which lie remote from view. The existence

of molten material within the earths crust naturally awakens a suspicion that

the process of cooling has not been wholly by conduction, but also to some slight

extent by convection, and to a still greater extent by the bodily migration of

liquid lava from the deeper layers of tlie crust towards the surface.

The existence of local reservoirs of molten rock within the crust is even

still more important in another coucection, that is, in relation with the supposed

' averacre rate of increase of temperature with descent below the ground.' It is

doubtful whether we have yet discovered a rate that in any useful sense can be

spoken of as ' average. The widely divergent views of ditterent authorities as to

the presumed value of this rate may well lead to reflection. The late Professor

Prestwich thought a rise of 1°F. for every 45 feet of descent below the zone
of constant temperature best represented the average ; Lord Kelvin in his earlier
estimates has adopted a value of 1° F. for every 51 feet ; the Committee of

this Association appointed to investigate this question arrived at a rate of 1° F.

for every 60 feet of descent ; Mr. Clarence King has made calculations in which a

rate of i° F. for 72 feet is adopted ; a re-investigation of recorded measurements
would, I believe, lead to a rate of 1° F. in 80 or 90 feet as more closely approaching

the mean. This would raise Lord Kelvin's estimate to nearly fifty millions of years.

    When from these various averages we turn to the observations on which

they are based, we encounter a surprising divergence of extremes from the

mean; tlius in the British Isles alone the rate varies from 1° F. in 34 feet
to 1° F. in 92 feet, or in one case to 1° F. in 130 feet. It has been sug-
gested, and to some extent shown, that these irregularities may be connected with
differences in conductivity of the rocks in whictt the observations were made, or
with the circulation of underground water : but many cases exist which cannot be
explained away in such a manner, but are suggestive of some deep-seated
cause, such as the distribution of molten matter below the ground. Inspection of
the accompanying map of the British Isles, on which the rates of increase in

different localities have been plotted, will afford some evidence of the truth of this
view. Comparatively low rates of increase are found over Wales and in the pro-
vince of Leijister, districts of relatively great stability, the remnants of an island
that have iu all probabilty stood above the sea ever since the close of the Silurian

period. To the north of this, as we enter a region which was subject to volcanic

disturbances during the Tertiary period, the rate increases.

     It is obvious that in any attempt to estimate the rate at which the earth is
cooling as a solid body the disturbing influence of subterranean lakes of molten
rock must as far as possible be eliminated ; but this will not be efl'ected by takino-

the accepted mean of olsserved rates of increase of temperature : sucli ah kv^Hg6

is merely a compromise, and a nearer approach to a correct result will possibly be
attained by selecting some low rate of increase, provided it be based on accurate

observations.

     It is extremely doubtful whether an area such as the British Isles, which has
80 frequently been the theatre of volcanic activity and other subterranean disturb-
ance, is the" best fitted to afford trustworthy results ; the Archteau nucleus of a
continent mipht be expected to afford surer indications. Unfortunately the hidden
treasures of the earth are seldom buried in these regions, and bore-holes in conse-
quence have rarely been made in them. One exception is afforded by the copper-
bearing district of Lake Superior, and in one case, that of the Calumet and Hecla
mine, which is 4,580 feet in depth, the rate of increase, as determined by Pro-
fessor A. Affassiz, was 1° F. for every 223'7 feet. The Bohemian 'horst'isa
somewhat ancient part of Europe, and in the Przibram mines, which are sunk in it,
the rate was 1° F. for every 12G feet of descent. In the light of these facts it
would seem that geologists are by no means compelled to accept the supposed mean
rate of increase of temperature with descent into the crust as affording a safe guide
to the rate of cooling of a solid globe; and if the much slower rate of increase
observed in the more ancient and more stable regions of the earth has the im-
portance which is suggested for it, then Lord Kelvin's estimate of the date of the

' consistentior status ' may be pushed backwards into a remoter past.
     If, as we have reason to hope, Lord Kelvin's somewhat contracted period will

yield to a little stretching:, Professor Joly's, on the other hand, may take some
paring. His argument, broadly stated, is as follows. The ocean consisted at first
of fresh water ; it is now salt, and its saltness is due to the dissolved matter that
is constantly being carried into it by rivers. If, then, we know the quantity of
salt which the rivers bring down each year into the sea, it is easy to calculate

how many years they have taken to supply the sea with all the salt it at present

contains. For several reasons it is found necessary to restrict attention to one

only of the elements contained in sea salt : this is sodium. The quantity of

sodium delivered to the sea every year  by  rivers  is  about 160,000,000  tons                    but
                                                                                                ;

the quantity of sodium which the sea contains is at least ninety millions of times

greater than th s. The period during which rivers have been carrying sodium

into the sea must therefore be about ninety millions of years. Nothing could be

simpler ; there is no serious flaw in the method, and Professor Joly's treatment of

the subject is admirable in every way ; but of course in calculations such as this
everything depends on the accuracy of the data, whicli we may therefore proceed

to discuss. Professor Joly's estimate of the amount of soHiLuu in the ocean may

Webe accepted as sufficiently near the truth for all practical purposes.                           may

therefore pass on to the other factor, the annual contribution of sodium by river

water. Ilere there is more room for error. Two quantities must be ascertained :

one the quantity of water which the rivers of the world carry into the sea, the

other the quantity or proportion of sodium present in this water. The total volume

of water discharged by rivers into the ocean is estimated by Kir John Murray as

0,524 cubic miles. The estimate being based on observations of thirty-three great

rivers, although only approximate, it is no doubt sufficiently exact ; at all events

such alterations as it is likely to undergo will not greatly affect the final result.

"When, however, we pass to the last quantity to be determined, the chemical com-

position of average river water, we find that only a very rough estimate is possible,

and this is the more unfortunate because changes in this may very materially aflect

our conclusions. The total quantity of river water discharged into the sea is, as

we have stated, G,524 cubic miles. The average composition of this water is deduced

from analvses of nineteen great rivers, which altogether discharge only 488 cubic

miles, or 7-25 per cent, of the whole. The danger in using this estimate is two-

fold : in the first place 7'25 is too small a fraction from which to argue to the re-

maining 92'75 per cent., and, next, the rivers which furnish it are selected rivers, i.e.,

they are all of large size. The efliect of this is that the drainage of the volcanic

regions of the ea7th is not sufFiciently represented, and it is precisely this drainage

which is richest in sodium salts. The lavas and ashes of active volcanoes rapidly
                       Transactions of section c.                   721

disintegrate under tile energetic action of various acid gases, and atnong volcanic

exhalations sodium chloride has been especially noticed as abundant. Conse-

quently we find that while the proportion of sodium in Professor Joly's average

river water is only o'73 per million, in the rivers of the volcanic island of Hawaii

it rises to 24-5 per million.^ No doubt the area occupied by volcanoes is trifling com-
pared with the remaining land surface. On the other hand the majority of volcanoes

are situated in regions of copious rainfall, of which they receive a full share

owing to their mountainous form. Much of the fallen rain percolates through the
porous material of the cone, and, richly charged with alkalies, finds its way by

underground passages towards the sea, into which it sometimes discharges by

submarine springs.

Again, several considerations lead to the belief that the supply of sodium to

the ocean has proceeded, not at a uniform, but at a gradually diminishing rate.
The rate of increase of temperature with descent into the crust has continuously

diminished with the flow of time, and this must have had its influence on the

temperature of springs, which furnish an important contribution to river water.

The significance of this consideration may be judged from the composition of the

water of geysers. Thus Geyser, in Iceland, contains 884 parts of sodium per

million, or nearly 160 times as much as Sir John Murray estimates is present in
Aaverage river water.
                       mean of the analyses of six geysers in difl'erent parts of

the world gives 400 parts of sodium per million, existing partly as chloride, but

also as sulphate and carbonate.

It should not be overlooked that the present is a calm and quiet epoch in the

earth's history, following after a time of fiery activity. More than once, indeed,

has the past been distinguished by unusual manifestations of volcanic energy, and

these must have had some effect upon the supply of Bodium to the ocean. Finally,

.ilthough the existing ocean water has apparently but slight effect in corroding

the rocks which form its bed, yet it certainly was not inert when its temperature
was not far removed from the critical point. Water begins to exert a powerful

destructive action on silicates at a temperature of 180° C, and during the interval

occupied in cooling, from 370° to 180° C, a considerable quantity of sodium may

have entered into solution.

A review of the facts before ns seems to render some reduction in Dr. Joly's
Aestimate imperative.
                       precise assessment is impossible, but I should be inclined

myself to take ofl' some ten or thirty millions of years.

   We may next take the evidence of the stratified rocks. Their total maximum

thickness is, as we have seen, 265,000 feet, and consequently if they accumulated

at the rate of one foot in a century, as evidence .seems to suggest, more than
twenty -six millions of years must have elapsed during their formation.

                    Obscure Chapter in the EarilCs History,

     Before discussing the validity of the argument on which this last result de-

pends let us consider how far it harmonises with previous ones. It is consistent

with Lord Kelvin's and Professor Darwin's, but how does it accord with Professor
Joly's ? Supposing we reduce his estimate to fifty-five millions : what was the earth

doing during the interval between the period of fifty-five millions of years ago and

that of only 26i millions ago, when, it is presumed, sedimentary rocks commenced to
be formed ? Hitherto we have been able to reason on probabilities ; now we enter

the dreary region of possibilities, and open that obscure chapter in the history of

the earth previously hinted at. For there are many possible answers to this

question. In the first place the evidence of the stratified rocks may have been
wrongly interpreted, and two or three times the amount of time we have demanded
may have been consumed in their formation. This is a very obvious possibiUty,
yet again our estimate concerning these rocks may be correct, but we may have

erroneously omitted to take into account certain portions of the Arcbrean complex,

ditious, and subsequently transformed under the influence of tlie internal heat of
the earth. This, I think, would be Professor Bonney's view. Finally Lord
Kelvin has argued that the life of the sun as a luminous star is even more briefly

limited than that of our oceans. In such a case if our oceans were formed fifty-

five millions of years ago, it is possible that after a short existence as almost
boiling water they grew colder and colder, till they became covered with thick ice,

and moved only in obedience to the tides. The earth, frozen and dark, except for
the red glow of her volcanoes, waited the coming of the sun, and it was not till his
growing splendour had banished the long night that the cheerful sound of running
waters was heard again in our midst. Then the work of denudation and deposition
seriously recommenced, not to cease till the life of the sun is spent. Thus the
thickness of the stratified series may be a measure rather of the duration of simlight

-- --than of the period which has elapsed since the first formation of the ocean. It

may have been so we cannot tell but it may be fairly urged that we know less

of the origin, history, and constitution of the sun than of the earth itself, and

that, for aught we can say to the contrary, the sun may have been shining on the

just-formed ocean as cheerfully as he shines to-day.

Time requiredfor the Evolution oftJie Living World.

But, it will be asked, how far does a period of twenty-six millions satisfy the

demands of biology ? Speaking only for myself, although I am aware that eminent

biologists are not wanting who share this opinion, I answer, Amply. But it will

be exclaimed. Surely there are ' comparisons in things.' Look at Egypt, where more

than 4,000 years since the same species of man and animals lived and flourished

as to-day. Examine the frescoes and study the living procession of familiar

forms they so faithfully portray, and then tell us, how comes it about that from

changes so slow as to be inappreciable in the lapse of forty centuries you propose

to build up the whole organic world in the course of a mere twenty-six millions of

--years ? To all which we might reply that even changeless Egypt presents us with

at least one change the features of the ruling race are to-day not quite the same

as those of the Pharaohs. But putting this on one side, the admitted constancy in

some few common forms proves very little, for so long as the environment remains

the same natural selection will conserve the type, and, so far as we are able to

judge, conditions in Egypt have remained remarkably constant for a long period.

Change the conditions, and the resulting modiflcation of the species becomes

manifest enough                                                                   and in this connection it  is  only necessary to recall the remark-
                                                                               ;

able mutations observed and recorded by Professor Weldon in the case of the

crabs in Plymouth Harbour. In response to increasing turbidity of the sea water

these crabs have undergone or are uudergoing a change in the relatire dimensions

of the carapace, which is persistent, in one direction, and rapid enough to be

determined by measurements made at intervals of a few years.

Again, animals do not all change their characters at the same rate : some are

stable, in spite of changing conditions, and these have been cited to prove that

none of the periods we look upon as probable, not twenty-five, not a hundred

millions of years, scarce any period short of eternity, is sufficient to account for the

evolution of the living world. If the little tongue-shell, Lingula, has endured with

next to no perceptible change from the Cambrian down to the present day, how

long, it is sometimes inquired, would it require for the evolution of the rest of the

animal kingdom ? The reply is simple : the cases are dissimilar, and the same record

which assures us of the persistency of the Lingula tells us in language equally

emphatic of the course of evolution which has led from the lower organisms upwards

to man. In recent and Pleistocene deposits the relics of man are plentiful : in the

latest Pliocene they have disappeared, and we encounter the remarkable form Pithe-

canthropus\ as we descend into the Tertiary systems the higher mammals are met

with, always sinking lower and lower in the scale of organisation as they occiu*

deeper in the series, till in the Mesozoic deposits they have entirely disappeared, and

theur place is taken by the lower mammals, a feeble i'olk, offering little promise of the

future ihey were to inherit. Still lower, and even these are gone ; and in the Permian

brata are no more found we trace the evolution of the invertebrata alone. Thus

the orderly procession of organic forms follows in precisely the true phylogenetic

sequence: invertebrata first, then vertebrates, at tirst lish, then amphibia, next

reptiles, soon after mammals, of the lowlier kinds tirst, of the higher later, and

these in increasing complexity of structure till we finally arrive at man himself.

While the living world was thus unfolding into new and nobler forms, th.j

immutable Lunjula simply perpetuated its kind. To select it, or other species

equally sluggish, as the sole measure of the rate of biologic change would seem as

strangT a proceeding as to confound the swiftness of a river with the stagnation

of the pools that lie beside its banks. It is occasionally objected that the story

we have drawn from the palteontological record in mere myth or is founded only

on negative evidence. Cavils of this kind prove a double misapprehension, partly

.·IS to the facts, partly as to the value of negative evidence, which may be as good
in its way as any other kind of evidence.

Geologists are not unaware of the pitfalls which beset negative evidence, and

they do not conclude trom the absence of fossils in the I'ocks which underlie the
Cambrian that pre-Cambrian periods were devoid of life ; on the contrary, they are

iully persuaded that the seas of those times M-ere teeming with a rich variety of
Howinvertebrate forms.
                                                                      is it that, with the exception of some few species found

in beds immediatelv underiving the Cambrian, these have left behind no vestige of

their existence ? The explanation does not lie in the nature of tbe sediments,

which are not unfitted for the preservation of fossils, nor in the composition of the

then exisiing sea water, which may have contained quite as much calcium carbonate as

occurs in our present oceans; and the only plausible supposition would appear to be

that the organisms of that time had not passed beyond the stao-e now represented

by the larvaj of existing invertebrata, and consequently were either unprovided

·with skeletons or at all events with skeletons durable enough for preservation. If

so, the history of the enrlier stages of the evolution of the invertebrata will receive

no light                   from pah-eontology                                                                                          and  no direct  answer can                                                                  be expected  to  the   question

whether, eighteen or nineteen millions of years being taken as sufficient for the

evolutionof the yertebrata, the remaining available eight millions would provide

for that of the invertebrate classes which are represented in the lowest Cambrian
deposits. On a priori grounds there would appear to be no reason why it should

not. If two millions of years afforded time enough for the conversion of fish into

amphibians, a similar period should suffice for the evolution of trilobites from

annelids, or of annelids from trochospheres. The step from gastrulas to trocho-

spheres might be accomplished in another two millions, and two millions more
would take us from gastrulas through morulas to protozoa.

As things stand, biologists can have nothing to say either for or against such
a conclusion

        Unexpected Absence of Thermal Me(a77io7'j)hosi8 in Ancient Rochs.

    Two difficulties now remain for discussion: one based on theories of mountain
chains, the other on the unaltered state of some ancient sediments. TLe latter may

be taken first. Professor van Hise writes as follows regarding the pre-Cambriin
rocks of the Lake Superior district: 'The Penokee series furnishes an instructive

lesson as to the depth to which rocks may be buried and yet remain but slicrhtlv

aflected by metamorphosis. The series itself is 14,000 feet thick. It was covered
before being upturned with a great thickness of Keweenaw rock. This series at
the Montreal Eiver is estimated to be 50,000 feet thick. Adding to this the known
thickness of the Penokee series, we have a thickness of 64,000 feet, . . . The

                                                                                    3 A2
724 REPORT--1900.

Penokee focks x^ere then buried to a great depth, the eiact atndunt depending

upon their horizon and upon the stage in Keweenaw time, when the tilting and

erosion, which brought them to the surface, commenced.

' That the synclinal trough of Lake Superior began to form before the end of the

Keweenaw period, and consequently that the Penokee rocks were not buried under

-- --the full succession, is more than probable. However, they must have been buried to a

great depth at least several miles and thus subjected to high pressure and

temperature, notwithstanding which they are comparatively unaltered.' ^

I select this example because it is one of the best instances of a difficulty that

occurs more than once in considering the history of sedimentary rocks. On the

supposition that the rate of increment of temperature with descent is 1° F. for

every 84 feet, or 1° C. for every 150 feet, and that it was no greater during these

early Penokee times, then at a depth of 60,000 feet the Penokee rocks would attain

a temperature of nearly 3.3.3° C. ; and since water begins to exert powerful chemical

action at 180° C. they should, on the theory of a solid cooling globe, have suffered

a metamorphosis sufficient to obscure their resemblance to sedimentary rocks.

Either then the accepted rate of downward increase of temperature is erroneous,

or the Penokee rocks were never depressed, in the place where they are exposed

to observation, to a depth of 50,000 feet. Let us consider each alternative,

and in the first place let us apply the rate of temperature increment deter-

mined by Professor Agassiz in this very Lake Superior district : it is 1° 0.

for every 402 feet, and twenty-five millions of years ago, or about the time when

we may suppose the Penokee rocks were being formed, it would be 1° C. for every

305'5 ieet, with a resulting temperature at a depth of 50,000 feet of 163° C. only.

Thus the admission of a very low rate of temperature increment would meet the

difficulty ; but on the other hand it would involve a period of several hundreds of

millions of years for the age of the ' consistentior status,' and thus greatly exceed
WeProfessor Joly's maximum estimate of the age of the oceans.
                                                               may therefore

turn to the second alternative. As regards this it is by no means certain that tiie

exposed portion of the Penokee series ever was depressed 50,000 feet : the beds lie

in a synclinal the base of which indeed may have .sunk to this extent, and entered

a region of metamorphosis ; but the only part of the system that lies exposed to

view is the upturned margin of the synclinal, and as to this it would seem impos-

sible to make any positive assertion as to the depth to which it may or may not have

been depressed. To keep an open mind on the question seems our only course for

the present, but difficulties like this offer a promising field for investigation.

                            The Formation of Mountain Ranges.

     It is frequently alleged that mountain chains cannot be explained on the hypo-

thesis of a solid earth cooling under the conditions and for the period we have
supposed. This is a question well worthy of consideration, and we may first

end>-avour to picture to ourselves the conditions under which mountain chains arise.
The floor of the ocean lies at an average depth of 2,000 fathoms below the land,

and is maintained at a constant temperature, closely approaching 0° C, by the
passage over it of cold water creeping from the polar regions. The average tem-
perature of the surface of the land is above zero, but we can aHbrd to disregard the
difference in temperature between it and the ocean floor, and may take them both
at zero. Consider next the increase of temperature with descent, which occurs
beneath the continents : at a depth of 13,000 feet, or at same depth as the ocean

floor, a temperature of 87° C. will be reached on the supposition that the rate of
increase is 1° C. for 150 feet, while with the usually accepted rate of 1° C. for
108 feet it would be 120° C. But at this depth the ocean floor, which is on the
same spherical surface, is at 0° C. Thus surfaces of equal temperature within the
earth's crust will not be spherical, but will rise or fall beneath an imaginary
spherical or spheroidal surface according as they occur beneath the continents or the

oceans. No doubt at some depth within the earth the departure of isothermal

                  « Tenth Annual EepoH U.S. Geol. Survey, 1888-89, p. 457.
              TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  726

surfaces from a spheroidal form will disappear; but considering tlie great breadth
both of continents and oceans this depth must be considerable, possibly even forty

or fifty miles. Thus the sub-continental excess of temperature may make itself

felt in regions where the r'icks still retain a hifrh temperature, and are probably not
far removed from the critical fusion point. The effect will be to render the con-
tinents mobile as regards the ocean floor ; or, vice versa, the ocean floor will be stable

compared with the continental masses. Next it may be observed that the con-
tinents pass into the bed of the ocean by a somewhat rapid flexure, and that it is

over this area of flexure that the sediments denuded from the land are deposited.

Under its load of sediment the sea-floor sinks down, subsiding slowly, at about the

same rate as the thickness of sediment increases; and, whether as a consequence or

a cause, or both, the flexure marking the boundary of land and sea becomes more

Apronounced.  compensating movement occurs within the earth's crust, and solid

material may flow from under the subsiding area in the direction of least resist-

ance, possibly towards the land. At length, when some thirty or forty thousand feet

of sediment have accumulated in a basin-like form, or, according to our reckoning,

after the lapse of three or four millions of years, the downward movement ceases, and
the mass of sediment is subjected to powerful lateral compression, which, bringing

its borders into closer proximity by some ten or thirty miles, causes it to rise in

great folds high into the air as a mountain chain.
     It is this last phase in the history of mountain making which has given geo-

logists more cause for painful thought than probably any other branch of their subject,
not excluding even the age o* the earth. It was at l:rst imagined that during the

flow of time the interior of the earth lost so much heat, and suffered so much con-

traction in consequence, that the exterior, in adapting itself to the shrunken body,

was compelled to fit it like a wrinkled garment. This theory, indeed, enjoyed a
happy existence till it fell into the hands of mathematicians, when it fared very
badly, and now lies in a pitiable condition neglected of its friends.^

     For it seemed proved to demonstration that the contraction consequent on
cooling was wholly, even ridiculously, inadequate to explain the wrinkling. But

when we summon up courage to inquire into the data on which the mathematical
arguments are based, we find that they include several assumptions the truth of
which is by no means self-evident. Thus it has been assumed that the rate at

which the fusion point rises with increased pressure is constant, and follows the

same law as is deduced from experiments made under such pressures as we can
command in our laboratories down to the very centre of the earth, where the

pressures are of an altogether difl'erent order of magnitude ; so with a still more

important coefficient, that of expansion, our knowledge of this quantity is founded

on the behaviour of rocks heated under ordinary atmospheric pressure, and it is

assumed that the same coefficient as is thus obtained may be safely applied to

material which is kept solid, possibly near the critical point, under the tremendous

pressure of the depths of the crust. To this last assumption we owe the terrible
bogies that have been conjured out of ' the level of no strain.' The depth of this
as calculated by the -Rev. 0. Fisher is so trifling that it would be passed through
by all very deep mines. Mr. C. Davison, however, has shown that it will lie
considerably deeper, if the known increase of the coefficient of expansion with rise

of temperature be taken into account. It is possible, it is even likely, that the

coefficient of expansion becomes vastly greater when regions are entered, where
the rocks are compelled into the solid state by pressure. So little do we actually
know of the behaviour of rock under these conditions that the geologist would

--seem to be left very much to his own devices ; but it would seem there is one

temptation he must resist he may not take refuge in the hypothesis of a liquid

interior.

   We shall boldly assume that the contraction at some unknown depth in the

interior of the earth is sufficient to afibrd the explanation we seek. The course of
events may then proceed as follows. The contraction of the interior of the earth,

consequent on its loss of Leat, causes tlie crust to fall upon it in folds, which rise
over the continents and sink under the oceans, and the flexure ot the area of

sediiuentatiiin is partly a consequence of this foldinp, partly of overloading. By

the time a depression ot some 30,000 or 40,000 feet has occurred along the ocean
border the relation between continents and oceans has become unstable, and

readjustment takes place, probably by a giving way of the continents, and chiefly

along the zone of greatest weakness, i.e. tbe area of sedimentation, which thus

becomes the zone of mountain building. It may be observed that at great depths

readjustment will be produced by a slow flowing of solid rock, and it is only^
comparatively near the surface, five or ten miles at tlie most below, that failure of
support can lead to sudden fracture and collapse; hence the comparatively super-

ficial origin of earthquakes.

   --Given a sufficiently large coeflicient of expansion and there is much to suggest
--its existence ' and all the phenomena of mountain ranges become explicable : they

begin to present an appearance that invites mathematical treatment ; they inspire
us with the hope that from a knowledge of the height and dimensions of a continent

and its relations to the borderinc ocean we may be al)le to predict when and wliere
a mnunlain chdn should arise, and the theory which explains them promises to

guide us to an interpretation of those world-wide unconformities which Suess
can only account for by a transgression of the sea. Finally it relieves us of the
difficulty presented by mountain formation in regard to the estimated duration of

geological time.

         Influence of Variations in the Eccentricity of the Earth's Orhit.

    This may perhaps be the place to notice a highly interesting speculation which
we owe to Professor Blytt, who has attempted to establish a connection between

periods of readjustment of the earth's crust and variations in the eccentricity of
the earth's orbit. Without entering into any discussion of Professor Blytt's

methods, we may ofi'er a comparison of his results with those that follow from our

rough estimate of one foot of sediment accumulated in a century.

which drains into the Gulf of jMexico measures 1,800,000 square miles ; the area
over which its sediments are deposited is, so far as I can gather from Professor

Agassiz's statements, less than 180,000 square miles ; while Mr. McGee'estimates it

at only 100,000 square miles. Usinji: the larger number, the area of deposition is

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

will therefore be ten times as great as the rate of denudation, or tt Jij foot may be

supposed to be uniformly distributed over the area of sedimentation in the course

of a year. But the thickness by which we have measured the strata of our

geological systems is not an average but a maximum thickness ; we have

therefore to obtain an estimate of the maximum rate of deposition. If we

assume the deposited sediments to be arranged somewhat after the fashion of a
wedge with the thin end seawards, then twice the average would give us the

maximum rate of deposition : this would be one foot in ll'O years. But the sheets of

deposited sediment are not merely thicker towards the land, thinner towards the

sea, they also increase in thickness towards the rivers in which they have their

source, so that a very obtuse-angled cone, or, better, the down-turned bowl of a
spoon, would more nearly represent their form. This form tends to disappear under

the action of waves and currents, but a limit is set to tliis disturbing influence by the

subsidence which marks the region opposite the mouth of a large river. By this the

strata are gradually let downwards, so that they come to assume the form of the

bowl of a spoon turned upwards. Thus a further correction is necessary if we are to
arrive at a fair estimate of the maximum rate of deposition. Considering the very

rapid rate at which our ancient systems diminish in thickness when traced in all
directions from the localities where they attain their maximum, it would appear
that this correction must be a large one. If we reduce our already corrected

estimate by one sixth, we arrive at arate of one foot of sediment deposited in a century.

    No doubt this value is often exceeded ; thus in the case of the Mississippi

River the bar of the south-west pass advanced between the years 1838 and 1874 a

distance of over 2 miles, covering an area 2'2 miles in width with a deposit of

sediment 80 feet in thickness ; outside the bar, where the sea is 2-50 feet in
depth, sediment accumulates, according to Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot, at a

rate of 2 feet yearly. It is quite possible, indeed it is very likely, that some of

our ancient strata have been formed with corresponding rapidity. No gravel

nor coarse sand is deposited over the Mississippi delta ; such material is

not carried further seawards than New Orleans. Thus the vast sheets of

conglomerate and sandstone which contribute so largely to some of our ancient
systems, such as the Cambrian, Old Red Sandstone, Millstone Grit, and Coal

Measures, must have accumulated under ver}' dillereut conditions, conditions for

which it is not easy to find a parallel; but in any case these deposits afford

evidence of very rapid accumulation.

These considerations will not tempt us, however, to modify our estimate of

one foot in  a century                                                for though in some cases this rate may have                                                                                                                                 been                  exceeded,
                                                                   ;

in others it may not have been nearly attained.

Closely connected with the rate of deposition is that of the changing level of

land and sea ; in some cases, as in the Wealden delta, subsidence and deposition
appear to have proceeded with equal steps, so that we might regard them as

transposable terms. It would therefore prove of great assistance if we could

determine the average rate at which movements of the ground are proceeding; it
might naturally be expected that the accurate records kept by tidal gauges in

various parts of the world would afford us some information on this subject; and

no doubt they would, were it not for the singular misbehaviour of the sea, which

does not maintain a constant level, its fluctuations being due, according to

Professor Darwin, to the irregular melting of ice in the polar regions. Of more

immediate application are the results of Herr L. ITolmstrcim's observations in

Scandinavia, which prove an average rise of the peninsula at the rate of 3 feet

in a century to be still in progress ; and Mr. G. K. Gilbert's measurements in the
great Lake district of North America, which indicate a tilting of the continent

at the rate of 3 inches per hundred miles per century. But while measurements
like these may furnish us with some notion of the sort of speed of these changes

they ave not siifBcient even to suggest an average ; for this we must be content to

wait till stilHcient tidal observations have accumulated, and the disturbing effect

of the inconstancy of the sea-level is eliminated.

It may be objected that in framing our estimate we have taken into account

mechanical sediments only, and ignored others of equal importance, such as lime-

stone and coal. With regard to limestone, its thickness in regions where systems

attain                       their              maximum                     may be     taken  as negligible                                                            nor is the  formation of lime-
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

stone necessarily a slow process. The successful experiments of Dr. Allan,

cited by Darwin, prove that reef-building corals may grow at the astonishing

rate of 6 feet in height per annum.

In respect of coal there is much to suggest that its growth was rapid. The

carboniferous period, well deserves its name, for never before, never since, have

Carbonaceous deposits accumulated to such a remarkable thickness or over such

wide areas of the earth's surface. The explanation is doubtless partly to be found in

favourable climatal conditions, but also, I think, in the youthful energy of a new

and overmastering type of vegetation, which then for tlie first time acquired the

dominion of the land. If we turn to our modern peat-bogs, the only carbona-

ceous growths available for comparison, we find from data given by Sir A. Geikie

that a fairly average rate of increase is 6 feet in a century, which might perhaps

correspond to one foot of coal in the same period.

The rate of deposition has been taken as uniform through the whole period of

time recorded by stratified rocks ; but lest it should be supposed that this involves

a tacit admission of uniformity, I hasten to explain that in this matter we have

no choice                                       we may feel convinced that the rate has varied from time to time, but
                                             ;

in what direction, or to what extent, it is impossible to conjecture That the sun

was once much hotter is probable, but equally so that at an earlier period it was

much                         colder                                 and even  if in  its youth  all  the    activities                                                 of          our  planet       were
                                                                 ;

Anenhanced this fact might not affect the maximum thickness of deposits.

increase in the radiation of the sun, while it would stimulate all the powers of

subaerial denudation, would also produce stronger winds and marine currents

stronger currents would also result from the greater magnitude and frequency of

the tides, and thus while larger quantities of sediment might be delivered into the

sea they would be distributed over wider areas, and the difference between the

maximum and average thickness of deposits would consequently be diminished.

Indications of such a wider distribution may perhaps be recognised in the Palaeozoic
systems. Thus we are compelled to treat our rate of deposition as uniform, not-

withstanding the serious error this may involve.

The reasonableness of our estimate will perhaps best appear from a few appli-

cations. Fig. 2 is a chart, based on a map by De Lapparent, representing the

distribution of land and sea over the European area during the Cambrian period.

The strata of this system attain their maximum thickness of 12,000 feet in

Merionethshire, Wales; they rapidly thin out northwards, and are absent in

Anglesey; scarcely less rapidly towards Shropshire, where they are 3,000 feet

thick ; still a little less rapidly towards the Malverns, where they are only 800 feet

thick                        and                most                slowly    towards  St.  David's  Head,  where                                                      they        are  7,400  feet  thick.

was the extent of this land none can say ; some geologists imagine it to have

obliterated the whole or greater part of the North Atlantic Ocean. For my part
I am content with a somewhat large island. What area of this island, we mav

ask, would suffice to supply the Cambrian sediments of Wales and Shropshire'?

Admitting that the area of denudation was ten times as large as the area of

deposition, its dimensions are indicated by the figure ah c d on the chart. This

evidently leaves room enough on the island to furnish all the other deposits

which are distributed along the western shores of the Cambrian Sea, while those

on the east are amply provided for by that portion of the European continent

which then stood above water.

If one foot in a century be a quantity so small as to disappoint the imagina-

tion of its accustomed exercise, let us turn to the Caqibviau succegsion of Scan-.

dinavia, where all the zones recognised in the British series are represented by a
column of sediment 290 feet in thickness. If 1,600,000 years be a correct
estimate of the duration of Cambrian time, then each foot of the Scandinavian

strata must have occupied 5,ul3 years in its formation. Are these figures

sufficiently inconceivable ?

    In the succeeding system, that of the Ordovician, the maximum thickness is

17,000 feet. Its deposits are distributed over a wider area than the Cambrian,

but  they also  occupied  longer  time in tbeir  formation                                           hence the area from

which they were derived need not necessarily have been larger than tbat of the

preceding period.

maximum thickness is found over the Lake district, and amounts to 15,000 feet

but in the little island of Gothland, where all the subdivisions of the system, from

the Landovery to the Upper Ludlow, occur in complete sequence, the thickness is

only 208 feet. In Gothland, therefore, according to our computation, the rate of

accumulation was one foot in 7,211 years.

With this example we must conclude, merely adding that the same story is

mytold by other systems and other countries, and that, so far as                                     investigations

have extended, I can find no evidence which would suggest an extension of the

estimate I have proposed. Ifc is but an estimate, and those who have made

acquaintance with ' estimates ' in the practical affairs of life will know how far

this kind of computation may guide us to or from the truth.

     1. Notes on the Geology and Palceontology of Patagonia.

              By W. B. Scott, Princeton University,

For the past four years Princeton University has been conducting explorations

in Patagonia under the direction of Mr. J. B. Hatcher. The large expenses of the

uudertalving have been defrayed by the generosity of friends in Kew York and

Baltimore, and Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan has given the sum of 5,000/. for the

publicHtion of the important results v.'hich Mr. Hatcher has obtained.

The oldest sedimentary formation observed is a marine Cretaceous found in the

Cordillera the Ammonites of this horizon have been studied by Mr. Stanton, and
                                                          ;

he rrportsthat they indicate Gault age and show close relationship to the Uitenhage

beds of South Africa.

The oldest marine Tertiaries are given in the section near the Straits of

myMagellan, and  assistant, Dr. Ortmann, informs me that tlie fossils point to a

late Eocene or Oligocene age for these beds, which he has called the Magellanian

beds. These are overlaid by the great Patagonian formation, which is of great

extent, of marine origin, and richly fossiliferous. The 200 species of marine

invertebrate fossils obtained from this horizon have been studied by Dr. Ortmann,

and lead to some very interesting conclusions. In the first place they unequi-

vocally demonstrate the Miocene age of the beds (not Cretaceous and oldest

Eocene as Ameglimo has maintained), and in the second place they display the

closest resemblance to the Miocene of Australia and New Zealand, pointing to a

shore connection witli those countries in Miocene times. The Patagonian and

supra-Patagoiiian stages are shown not to be distinguishable.

The Santa Cruz beds, a fresh-water and terrestrial formation, overlie and

partially dovetail in with the Patagonian. They contain an incredibly abimdant

and varied mammalian fauna, of which a vast collection was brought home. This
fauna has only a very remote connection with the Miocene mammals of the

northern hemisphere, and strongly confirms Piitimeyer's contention of a southern

centre of distribution. The presence of numerous carnivorous marsupials (there

are no true Carnivora) is additional evidence of a connection, direct or indirect,

with Australia.

Unconformably overlying the Santa Cruz is another marine formation, dis-

covered by Mr. Hatcher and by him named the Cape Fairweather beds. The

fossils indicate the Pliocene age of these beds.

Mr. Hatcher's labours have thus resulted in proving that Patagonian geology

is in complete accord with the system established for the northern hemisphere, and

that it is not of such exceptional character as has been supposed.

    2. On the Order of the Formation of the Silicates in Igneous Bocks.
                       By Prof. J. JoLY, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.

     The viscous properties of fused silica are shown, by experiments on the
stretching of ' quartz fibres,' to extend to temperatures so low as 716° C. The
silica fibre develops crystalline structure at 1040° C. Eock crystal in fine powder
exposed on the platinum ribbon of the meldometer to a temperature of 1100° C.
for lour hours shows distinct evidence of fusion. At 1200° C, falling to 915° C.
in eighteen hours, its fusion and incipient recrystallisation are easily accomplished.

     The principal silicates under prolonged heating (four hours) melt at tempera-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  731

tures which in all cases are inferior to the melting points determined on brief
observation. It is I'ound that silicates of low percentage of silica show a less
depression of melting point than those of high silica percentage, the result beinf
that the melting points as newly determined tall into general harmony with the
normal order of consolidation.

     The suggestion is oli'ered that the time reqiiired for the crystallised silicates to
assume the appearance of fusion is a rough measure of the stability of the
crystalline aggregate under conditions of hiuh temperature; for, in fact, it is a
measure of the crystalline rigidity opposing the unbalanced molecular surface-
force. It is shown that if this be accepted the stability-relations of the silicates with
one another may, according to the experiments, vary with temperature. Thus the
manner in which the time required to effect fusion varies with the temperature in

the cases of leucite and augite would indicate that in a high temperature magma
the stability of leucite may be greater than augite, and leucite may crystallise
in advance of augite. At lower temperatures augite is the more stable, and would
be idiomorphic towards leucite. In a cooling magma every stage of mutual
relations may arise. There will be one temperature for such substances at which

the stabilities are equal, and at this temperature, phenomena of inteigrowth, such

as pegmatitic development, will be favoured.

     Quartz may separate idiomorphically in a high temperature magma, being at
high temperatures more stable than most of the silicates, or it may be lelt over as
a residual constituent in a low-temperature magma, most of the ferro-magnesian
silicates being more stable at low temperatures. Again at low temperatures its

stability and that of the felspars approximate, and pegmatitic iutergrowth as a
frequent residuum is accordingly to be expected.

    The normal order of cou^olldation follows in general that of the maximum

stabilities of the silicates, that is, their stabilities at low temperatures. Abnor-
malities of order may be expected to arise more especially in connection with rapid

cooling of a magma for long preserved under conditions of high temperature.

     Appearances of magmatic instability, such as resorption, alteration of species,

corrosion, &c., are ascribed to changes in the stability relations of the silicates
with descending tempei'ature.

        4. Some ExperiTiients on Denudation in Fresh and Salt Water,

                          By Prof. J. Joly, D.Sc, F.R.S.

     The question of the relative rates of solution in fresh and salt water of the
more important rock materials is considered in this paper, which records the
results of experiments on basalt, orthoclase, obsidian, and hornblende.

     In these experiments equal weights of fresh material in the same state of
subdivision are exposed to the solvent action of fresh and salt water under like

conditions of temperature, aeration, &c.
     In order to secure full aiiratiou, in one set of four duplicate experiments on

the substances mentioned, the material is treated in the form of fine powder, and
the solvent containing it maintained in motion by a continuous stream of filtered
and moistened air escaping in bubbles at the bottom of the containing vessel. The
maintained action of atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen is thus secured.
Alter three months' continuous exposure to these conditions the solvent was
removed and analysed.

      In a second foini of experiment, confined to basalt, the fresh material is
brought to the grain of a fine sand, and is placed in U-tubes through which the
solvent passes alternately in opposite directions, air being freely admitted. This
experiment lasted for four months, the circulation of the solvent being maintained
for six hours daily.
--732 EEPOET 1900.

     In the final results the analyses of the salt- water solutions are compared with
the analyses of unused samples of the sea water.

     The "results in all cases ascribe to the sea water solvent effects greatly
exceeding those of fresh water, contrary to what is generally believed to be the
case. Although it was found impossible to estimate tbe alkali^-s and magnesia
taken up by the sea waters, the total estimated amount of material taken into
solution is from 2j to 14 times the mass determined in the fresh-water solutions,
the preponderance being specially marked in the lime. Complete analyses of
the sea water would, of course, ascribe a still greater preponderance to its
activity. Tlie preponderance of activity is most marked in the cases of orthoclase
and hornblende. Obsidian proved to be the most insoluble of the substances

dealt with.

     The consideration of the application of these experiments to the relative rates
of marine and atmospheric denudation is deferred till other experiments are com-

pleted, as this question also involves the conservative action of exhausted

materials precipitated or left in situ. But the experiments as they stand show
that the conclusion often drawn from Daubree'a well-known experiment with
orthoclase exposed to tbe solvent action of chloride of sodium solution is erroneous,
sea water in presence of the atmosphere being a much more active solvent of

rock materials than fresh water.

                        5. The Inner Mechanism of Sedimentation.

                            By Prof J. Jolt, D.Sc, F.R.S.

     The precipitating effects of marine salts on suspended particles of clay, &c.,

are responsible for geological effects of great magnitude. This paper is occupied

by an account of experimental work directed to the investigation of the inner
mechanism of these actions.

     It is shown that the precipitating effects of salts in solution in general vary with
the valency of the electro-positive ion and (within certain limits) according to the
same law as obtains in the case of the coagulative power exerted by electrolytes

on colloids. At very extreme dilutions a further remarkable activity of triad

salts is revealed.

      These actions are ascribed to the electrical effects of the ions which by their
free charges neutralise the repulsive 'electric layers 'of the immersed particles,
bringing about llocculation, when precipitation follows, the theory being similar
to that which has been applied to colloids.

     The extension of the theory to the larger particles involved in sedimentation is
considered. It is shown that larger particles, by diminishing the element of
 chance entering into the encounters of ions with particles, will tend to conceal
the valency effects. Conformably with this it is found that the finer sediments
require more concentrated solutions than the coarser to produce equal effects.
Similarly' it is shown that at high concentrations the effects dependent on the
amount of charge carried by the ion (the valency effects) should be concealed. In
agreement with this it is observed that concentrations above about 5 gram
equivalents per litre produce floccuiative effects equal in degree in monad, diad,
and triad salts.

      The floccuiative effects of the constituents of sea water are compared, and it
 is shown that, owing to its monad valency, the chloride of sodium, although so
largely preponderating, produces effects no greater than the separate effects of the
magnesium chloride and magnesium sulphate present, and rather inferior effects to

the calcium sulphate.

      Applications to geology follow. The compacting of marine sediments and the

 deposition in bulk of the finer detrital sedimentary rocks are ascribed to the
 ionjsation in the sea of the salts dissolved by denudation from the rocks.

6. On Tidal Sand Hippies above Low-water MarJc.
By Vaughan Cornish, M.Sc, F.C.S., F.R.G.S.

In the tliird Report of the Committee appohited to investigate the Action of

Waves and Currents on the Beds and Foreshores of Estuaries by means of Working

--Models (Cardift'meeting, 1891), Professor Osborne Reynolds writes: 'The large tidal

sand ripples below low water in the model estuaries, with the flood and ebb taking

the same course, constitute a feature which it is impossible to overlook, yet the

existence of corresponding ripples had been entirely overlooked in actual estuaries

until they were found to exist when they were looked for, having been first seen

in the models. The reason that they were overlooked before is, no doubt, ex-

plained by the fact that the bottom is not visible below low-water mark in actual

estuaries ; but this is not all. In the estuaries these ripples, where found, have been

confined to the bottoms and sides of the nari-ow channels between high sand-banks,

and they do not occur on the level sands below low water towards the mouths of

estuaries to anything like the same extent as in the models.

In December 1899 the author observed that the extensive sand-banks which

are exposed at every tide in the Mawddach Estuary, opposite Barmouth, North

W^ales, were covered, even in their hiufhest parts, with remarkably regular series

of sand ripples, averaging about 16 feet from ridge to ridge. The identity of

origin of these sand ripples with the tidal sand ripples of Osborne Reynolds was

soon established, and it appeared that they afforded an opportunity for more de-

tailed study than is practicable in the case of structures beneath low-water mark.

The author therefore made observations, with measurements and photographs,

during the six mi mths January-June 1900, of the sands at Barmouth (N. Wales),

Grange (Lancashire), Findhorn (N.B.), Montrose (N.B.), Mundesley (Norfolk), the

Goodwins, Pegwell Bay (Kent), on the Severn between Newnham and Severn

Tunnel, and at Aberdovey (N. Wales).

It appears that between certain limits of speed and depth the steady action

of a current can produce these ripples of regular wave-lenffth without the

agency of periodic quickenings and checkings such as operate in the formation of

the ordinary ripple-mark of the strand. The author has observed in the shallow

streams of sandy foreshores that a train of sand ridges of regular wave-length is

produced almost instantaneously when the velocity of the stream becomes

sufficient to render the water decidedly turbid with flying sand. On the other

hand, a current flowing over tidal sand ripples with clmr water can be seen

to lower them. It appears probable that their formation commences at that

critical velocity at which a great part of the moving sand is thrown into ' eddying

suspension,' and no longer merely rolls or slides along the bottom and that they
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

can be produced independently of co-operation between flood and ebb, although

where flood and ebb pursue the same course but in opposite directions the

ridges may become more regular. The mechanism of their formation seems to

be as follows : when a current, flowing over extensive sands, attains the velocity

at which the sand is largely thrown into eddying suspension, then a state is soon

reached in which the amount of sand dropped by the current is on thp ivhole equal

to the amount picked up by it, but any small excrescence causes a convergence of

current in the lowest layers of the water (' forced towards the centre of the curve '

as at the bends of rivers). Under the specified conditions as to the charge of

sand held in suspension, the excrescence increases. In like manner any slight

depression is deepened. ' Scour ' in the troughs and ' fill ' on the ridges proceeds ;

and this goes on until the concentration of the stream over the ridge, and its

Aexpansion above the trough, balance the effect.           considerable degree of

regularity in the size and form of the ridges is soon attained, and the dimen.sions

are limited by the depth and by the speed of the current.

Since the amplitude of the sand ridge is limited by the depth of the water, it is

evident that a sand-bank in a tideway cannot dry in ridges if the final runnings of

shallow water be prolonged or violent. Similarly the rising tide produces the greater

effect in ridging when the first part of the flood is gentle. Thus the Dun Sands,

below the junction of the Wye and Severn, being protected from rapid shallow

water currents by a rocky ridge called EDglish Stones on the seaward side of ttetn,
are finely ridged. Fifteen consecutive ridges were found to average 37' 8" from
rido-e to ridge, and 22" in amplitude. Above iSevern Bridge, on the contrary,
where the first of the flood comes almost as a bore and the ebb current, com-

mencing long after high water, runs strongly to the last, the sands when dry are

almost smooth.
     In estuaries where the sand-banks dry in tidal sand ridges, their size and direc-

tions afford at a glance a good idea of the course and velocities of the streams of
flood and ebb over these banks^ and of'en show by the steep face of the ripple in
what parts the flood or the ebb respectively is the stronger. The present position
of the lower portion of the rivers in the valleys of Aberdovey, Barmouth, and
Montrose is apparently due to the alongshore drift of beach material from the side
exposed to the greatest waves. To this are also due the D shape of their tidal
basins and the resulting circulation of the tide. The deep-water channel of the

ebb is down the straight limb of the D, which is close under the hills which bound

the valley, having been pushed as far as possible by the drift of beach material.
     Tidal" sHud ripples above low-water mark are not confined to estuaries, being

often found upon the st-a-shore in places where there are strong currents. They
face with the current, not with the swell, and are thus readily distinguished from
wave ripple-mark. Owing to variable direction of the currents in such situations,
the ripples are not generally in long straight ridges. It often happens that the
only traces of the tidal sand ripples left by the receding tide on the sea-shore are
pools, the characteristic section of which (like that of the print of a horse's iioof in
sand) indicates that analogy with the fuljes of the desert which is demonstrated
by the author's observations.

     The complete paper, illustrated by photographs, is intended for publication in

                                   By S. W. CuTTRiss.

      The portion of Yorkshire to which this paper refers is contained in Sheets 49,
 50, and CO (New Series) of the 1-inch Ordnance Survey. The great Craven
 Faults which traverse it in a N.W. to S E. direction have produced a difference of
 level of the strata of several thousands of feet ; the limestones on the south side
 of the Faults being far below the surface.

      The Silurian slates and grits form the basement beds, and are exposed in several
 of the valleys. On these rests the Carboniferous Limestone, which has a thickness
 of about 500 feet from the base to the present exposed surface on Inglehorough.
 The name Carboniferous Limestone is here applied only to distinguish a particular
 bed of rock in the district. Above this are a series of thinner limestones, shales,
 and sandstones (the Yoredales of Professor Phillips) capped by Millstone Grit.
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                     735

     Towards the west the Carboniferous Limestone has been cut off by the Dent
Fault, while the Craven Faults determine its extension towards the south. The
main line of fault passes tliroug-h Ingieton, Olapham, and Austwiek to Settle, then
eastwards by Malliam. North of this is another fault, near the tirst at Austwiek,

Hbut about miles apart at Malhaui. Further north the most interestiu": caves

and pot-holes are found in an area comprising the Leek Fells, Kingsdale, Chapel-
le-Dale, Ribblesdale, and around Ingleborough.

    The whole area may be divided into three sections :

1. The Yoredales, comprising the rocks of that name. These limestones being

comparatively thin, and intercalated with beds of shale and sandstone, the caves

are small and obstructed with earth, through which the watej- percolates. They

are at an elevation of from 1,300 to 1,000 feet, and do not materially aiiect the

drainage of the ground.

2. The Southern Carboniferous, including the Carboniferous Limestone between

the two Craven Faults. Although part of the same formation as the Carboniferous

Limestone north of the Fault, yet the caves in the two section3 differ entirely in

their characteristics. Here they are distinguished by an absence of running water,

the walls are covered with a considerable thickness of calcareous deposit, and their

entrances are blocked with clay and rock di5bris. The well-known Victoria and

AAttermire Caves are included in this section.  further characteristic is the
--entire absence of pot-holes vertical chasms in the ground caused by falling water

enlarging the rock fissures.

3. The Main Carboniferous, which includes the remainder of the Carboniferous

Limestone within the ai-ea defined. Here there are no dry caves, all being active

drainage channels. Pot-holes also are very abundant. In the Leek Fell and

Kingsdale districts the caves are almost without exception those of engulfment,

while in Chapel-le-Dale and Piibblesdale they are cliiefly caves of debouchure.

The first-named are usually low at the entrance. The passages then increase in

height to 20 feet or more, but rarely exceed 6 feet in w'idth, usually much

narrower. Some may be traversed a quarter of a mile or more, such as Lost John's

Cave, which terminates in a subterranean pot-hole over 100 feet deep. The caves

of debouchure are much more numerous. The mouth is generally wide and
Ashallow, with a fiat roof.
                              cascade or waterfall is usually found some little

distance in, beyond which the passage is a simple water-worn channel, gradually

shallowing and broadening until too low to permit of further progress.

     The pot-holes occur at or near the top of the limestone, at between 1,100 and
1,300 feet elevation, and always where there are surface streams, which fall into

the chasms. Over thirty have been named, nearly all of which have been

descended by the writer and friends, members of the Yorkshire Kamblers' Club,
many of them for the first time. Half the number are over 100 feet deep. Gaping
Ghyll, on Ingleborough, attains a depth of 350 feet, and was first descended by
Mons. E. A. Jlartel in 1 895 Rowten Pot, in Kingsdale, was conquered in 1807, and
found to bn 365 feet deep, thus being the deepest known pot-hole in the country.

    No evidence of the presence of the Silurian rocks has been found, the lowest

observable rock being either light or black limestone. The average summer
temperature in both caves and pot-holes is 48° Fahr.

    The writer has prepared a special map of the district on which are shown all
the known caves and pot-holes, with the surface streams. Such a map illustrates

in a forcible manner the interesting fact that the entire surface drainage of
Ingleborough is swallowed up by the limestone. Not a single stream from the
higher levels continues an uninterrupted course into the valley below.

     Introduction. Description of the area investigated. The Silurian and Car-
boniferous rocks between Malham Tarn and Malham are traversed by two

branches of the Craven Fault with the downthrow to the south. Malham Tarn

lies on Silurian, and its overflow sinks in the limestone directly the northern fault

is crossed. The draiuage of the area to the west of the Tarn disappears at the
Smelt Mill Sink The drainage of the area east of the Tarn is carried off by

Gordale Beck along the coarse of which some water sinks into the jointed lime-

stone. To these three sinks correspond three principal outlets, the stream at
Malham Cove, Aire Head Springs, and the springs at the bottom of Gordale.
    The history of previous investigations is then given. From the centre of

Malham Cove a dry limestone gorge runs in a northerly direction to the Tarn.
Up to the beginning of this century floodwaters were known to traverse this
valley and dLscharge over the Cove. There are several sinks along the hne of

Nowthis dry valley.  all the overflow is taken by three sinks south of the Tarn.

Various efforts have been made to trace the connection between the sinks and
outlets. Flushes of water from the Tarn have been shown to affect Aire Head
before Malham Cove. Experiments by introducing chaff, bran, magenta, and

uranin into the sinks failed to show any traces at the outlets.
The present investigation was carried out during 1899 by a Committee of

Enn-ineers, Chemists, and Geologists, appointed by the Yorkshire Geological
and Polytechnic Society. Flushes of water were sent down from the Tarn to the
Tarn Water Sinks. Aire Head Springs responded in two hours. With large

flushes a rise in Malham Beck was also observed.

The chemical investigations were as follows :

    Ammonium sulphate was put in below the Malham Tarn Sluice on June 22,

and appeared at Aire Head from July 4 to 11. Distinct traces were also found
at Malham Cove on the same dates.

    Common salt and fluorescein, put in at the Smelt Mill Sink between June 22

and 28, appeared at Malham Cove from July 4 to 11.
     Fluorescein, put in at Tranlands Beck on June 22, appeared at Scalegill Mill

Ammonium sulphate, put into upper Gordale Beck on August 2G, appeared at

the springs below Gordale Scar on September 7.

    Common salt, put into Cawden * Burst ' on September 18, appeared at Mire's

Barn from September 23 to      27.        ,  Grey  ^.,,  ,,Cave  was  not  traced.
     Fluorescein put into the
                               bottom  of          Gill

A geological investigation of the area showed that the limestone is traversed
by two sets°of prominent joints, of wbich the master-joints, which run in a north-
west to south-east direction, are very well developed. These master-joints are

found to laro-ely determine the flow of the underground waters.
The direction of these master-joints unites the Smelt Mill Sinks and Malham
ACove directly, and that may be taken as the direction of flow.
                                                                                    parallel line

from Malham Tarn Sinks would bring the water from them to Grey Gill, a dry
valley in the escarpment to the east of Malham Cove. No evidences of moving

water were found there.

     To the south of the Mid-Craven Fault the jointing of the limestone is found
to be variable; but prominent joints were found bearing in a north-east and south-
west direction! If the Tarn water followed these joints on crossing the fault it
would traverse a direction almost at right angles to its previous course, and,
following the limestone in its bend underneath a synclinal of Yoredale shale,
would be likely to reappear at Aire Head Springs, which is the nearest point

for xe-emergence on the southern side of the anticlinal.
     The master-joints north of the Mid-Craven Fault would similarly carry the

water which sinks into the bed of Gordale Beck south-eastward into the lime-
stone, and if, as it nears the fault, it followed a set of joints running at right
ano-le's to the previous set, it would come out at the springs at the foot of Gordale

Scar which was found to be the case by the chemical tests. Gordale itself turns

in this direction from some cause.
     The conclusions of the Committee are :

1. That Malham Cove Spring discharges the water from Smelt Mill Sink and
                                                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION 0.                           737

the limestone area west of the dry valley ; and under certain conditions some of
the Tarn water.

    2. That Aire Head Springs discharge the main portion of the water disappear-
ing down Malham Tarn Water Sinks.

     3. That Gordale Beck Springs discharge the water sinking in Upper Gordale.
    4. That chemicals put into Cawden ' Burst ' appeared at Mire's Barn.
     5. That Tranlands Beck Sinks discharge at Scalegill Mill,
     6. The investigations show that within the area the main direction of under-
ground flow is along the master-joints of the limestone.^

          7. On Ancient Plateaux in Anglesey and Carnarvonshire.

                                      Bij E. Greenly, F.G.S.

     The surface of Anglesey, considered as a whole, is seen to be composed of a
series of broad ridges ranging N.E. and S.AV., and so remarkably even in height
as to leave little doubt that they are really portions of an undulating plateau
about 200-300 ft. above the sea. Holyhead Mountain and about four other hills
rise abruptly above the general level. This plateau is traversed, not bounded, bv
the Menai Straits, beyond which it ranges to the foot-hills of the mountain region,
where a totally different type of scenery begins. The protile of this mountain
region appears, when viewed from the N.W., as that of a very gentle flattened
dome, rising gradually from Penmaenbach, on the N.E., till it attains a height of
more than 3,500 ft. in the Carnedds and Snowdon, and declines again as gradually

to Yr Eifl and Carn Boduan, in the far S.W. This, therefore, and the Ano-lesey

plateau, would appear to be ancient platforms or base-levels ; and they also appear
to be distinct.

     That of Anglesey must be at least of post-Carboniferous age, for Carboniferous

and older rocks are levelled off indiscriminately at its surface, and if the Red rocks
of the island are Permian or Triassic it must be of Mesozoic, possibly of Cretaceous,
age. The age of the platform bounding the mountain region is more difficult to
determine. It is tentatively suggested that this feature may pass below the

Carboniferous rocks, and so be really a deeply denuded sub-Carboniferous base-level
rising as the core of a broad anticlinal.

                                                        8. On the Form of some Rock-bosses in Anglesey.
                                                                       By E. Greenly, F.G.S.

The general trend of the major axis of the bosses that are so marked a feature

of the land surface in Anglesey coincides as a rule with the strike of the dominant

structures, which is for the most part N.E.-S.W. But slight discordances are not

uncommon                                                and in some cases,  particularly  among  the  hornblende gneisses about
                                                     ;

Craig-y-Allor, the bosses trend iu the usual N.E.-S.W. direction, in spite of the

fact that the banding of the gneiss strikes almost N.AV.-S.E., i.e., very nearly at

right angles to this.

features Althougli descrioed by Professor Sedgwick more than sixty years ago
with other magnesian beds in the north of England, it is still comparatively

unknown. He divided the concretions in these strata into ten classes, but I have

been unable to Hnd any classified collection except the one in the Newcastle

Mineum even this is only partially done
                                                 ;
    My own studies at Fulwell and Hendon lead me to suggest a new classification,

with^^ye primary forms,_ viz. (1) rods, (2) bands, Qi) rings, (4) balls and modified
spheres, (5) eggs. Combinations of these forms constitute the major part of these
massive beds, and frequently a bed of less than a foot thick shows examples of
several different corabinatio'iis. These I place in ten classes, though they may have

to be added to. The chief types are (1) tubes, (2) ' caulifiowers,' {?>) basaltiform,
(4) irregular, (5 and 6) troughs and bands (two kinds), (7) ' fanlike,' (8 and 9)

'honeycomb' or coralloid (two kinds"), (10) pseudo-organic.
     Photographs were exhibited on the screen showing both the primary forms and

the combinations as seen (wherever possible) in the undisturbed rock sections.

    My ovyn conclusions are as follows :

     1. That the rod structure is secondary to the formation of the conspicuous
bands which run across the beds at various angles. (These bands need to be
distinguished from the bands mentioned amoug the ' primary forms ') The
conspicuous bands act as planes of origin for the ' rods,' and do not cross through
the long axes of the rods themselves. They appear never to cross the bedding
planes,"though occasionally they follow them and also the outhne of the joints.

The question therefore arises, whether this does not give us a clue to the age
and sequence of the changes which have occurred in these beds, and whether the
previous existence of joints does not mean that the beds were already above the

sea-level when the changes commenced.
    2. The rods invariably start from the last-mentioned bands, and may be seen

at every possible angle. As they have grown upwards and obliquely as well as
downwards, the term ' stalactitic ' is a very misleading one to use. As Mr.
Garwood stated long ago, these beds 'present many points which appear irrecon-

cilable with the theory of their stalactitic origin.'
     3. The first step in the series of changes which have taken place was probably

an orderly but unsymmetrical arrangement of amorphous molecules of calcium
carbonate which separated themselves from those of the carbonate of magnesia.

     4. The internal architecture is due to such arrangement of amorphous particles
of lime which has since been coated with an outer crystalline layer. In some cases,
however, the central part has undergone a complete subsequent change into a

crystalline condition.

     5 Pearl-spar (crystals of the combined carbonates) is not always met with. I

failed to find any.

     6. In the Fulwell beds there are very few fossils, and where met with, as at

Marsden, concretionary action is not always traceable near them.
     7. The specimens at Fulwell which arouse the most interest are coralloid

masses ('honeycomb' of the quarrymen). They are confined, so far as I could
discover, to a stratum, about li foot thick, above the marl bed, and lie in close

juxtaposition to each other, which accounts for their peculiar external shape.

    8. Very little evidence of erosion of lime is to be seen anywhere ; unless we may

attribute the cavities in the bulls and elsewhere to this cause.

In conclusion I would point out the  close  resemblance which  exists between
                                                                                                     _

the ' lines ' and ' planes ' in these concretionary beds, and the ' lines ' which shoot

across congealing water. In some respects the architecture of the magnesian beds

compares with the ice decorations seen on our window-panes in frosty wea.ther.

of the materials of the Hollybush Conglomerate by the author does not support

this view.

     The most abundant pebbles consist of quartz ; these vary from a coarse mosaic
of crystals to a fine qiuirtz-schist. Most of the varieties are probably of meta-
morpbic origin; some appear to be merely vein-quartz, and some represent the
quartzose portions of granites and other rocks, lied (jranites and (jvanophyres,
often crushed, are tolerably abundant ; these often contain microcline. Mica-schist
and chlorite-schist occur rarely. Very abundant are difi'erent varieties of felsite.
These appear to be mostly micro- or crypto-crj^stalline, and often micro-graphic,
rhjoliten, compact or porphyritic ; sometimes banded, and occasionally spherulitic.

Some of the varieties may represent crushed intrusive./'c&jY^'S. Far rarer than the

rhyolites are microlithic andesites, or andesitio bamlts. Other pebbles, and the
grains of the groundmass, consist of materials derivable from the rocks mentioned

above.

     The resemblance of these materials to the rocks of the Malvern Range is suffi-
ciently close to prope the Pre-Cambrian age of the latter. But striking differences
in microscopic structure and in the proportionate numbers of corresponding rocks
in the two series, and the absence of any relation between the local nature of the
conglomerate and that of the Archaean mass nearest to it, can hardly be explained
except on the assumption that the Range itself did not furnish the materials.

     The stratigraphical relations of the conglomerate and Archaean mass, moreover,

-- --appear to indicate that the Malvern Hills the southern portion at least in

Cambrian times formed part of an area of deposition, and not of denudation.
     The author maintains, then, that the Malvern Hills did not form a coast-line

in Cambrian times, a conclusion which is in agreement with his former contention

that they arose at a much later date.

 11. On the Igneous Rocks associated with the Cambrian Beds of Malvern,
                         By Theodore Groom, M.A., D.Sc.

     The igneous rocks of the Cambrian beds of the Southern Malverns have
commonly been regarded as of volcanic origin. The author, after a careful
examination of the rocks under the microscope, and of the ground, concludes that
the scoriae and tufis previously described are non-existent, and that the whole of
the igneous rocks are probably intrusive. They consist of silts and small laccolites
of basic and iiltra-basic olivine diabase and olivine basalt, in which olivine is often
extremely abundant, and of bosses and dykes of peculiar amphibole bearing

andesites and andesitic basalts.
     Intrusion probably took place in Ordovician times.

              By Professor W. J. Sollas, D.8c., LL.D., F.R.S.

   A very expensive and laborious investigation was undertaken some years ago

to determine the dip of the Palaeozoic rocks reached by deep borings at \Vare and
Cheshunt. The results were communicated to the Association by Mr. J, Francis

on the occasion of its meeting in Ipswich in 1895. At Ware the Silurian strata,

which had been reached at a depth of 797 feet, were found to dip nearly due south,
at an angle of 41° ; at Turuford, near Cheshunt, Devonian rocks were encountered
at 980 feet, and dipped a little to the west of south at an angle of»25°.

the synclinals can be tracedwithsufHcient approximation by drawing lines at right

angles to the dips and describing circles from the point of intersection of these

lines as a centre. The thickness of the beds between any two points is given by

the length of the radius intercepted by the two corresponding circles. To test this

method it has been applied to cases in which the course of the synclinals was

known : one of these was atibrded by the section across the northern side of the

South Wales coal basin, along the course of the river Sawdde, a distance of four

miles; the other by the section exposed in the cuttings along the Rhymney railway

through the Old Red Sandstone, north of Cardiff, nearly two miles in length in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

both cases the results very closely approached the facts.

Two points at which the dips are known, such as those of Ware andCheshuut,

are sufficient to determine one side of a synclinal. From the construction obtained

a basin is indicated having its axis running east and west and situated below

Enfield Lock on the river Lea. Its northern half is thirteen miles in breadth, the

thickness of the contained strata 29,500 feet: of this 19,000 feet are Silurian

and Devonian ; the remaining 7,500 feet are Devonian and Carboniferous. How

much of this upper portion is Devonian is unknown, no great thickness probably,

when the great thickness, 19,000 feet, of the underlying Devonian and Silurian

Howis considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                much of the Carboniferous consists of productive Coal-

measures is also uncertain, but that there is ample room for an important coalfield

is shown by comparison with the Forest of Dean: that is only eight miles in width,

and the total thickness of the Carboniferous beds, upper and lower, contained by

it is only 3,500 feet, while the Enfield trough is approximately fourteen miles in

width and 7,500 feet in depth. An attempt to apply another method of deter-

mining the course of folds, employed by Professor Lapworth, shows that the

--thickness of the Enfield measures may be even greater than here given perhaps

10,000 feet.

    It is scarcely necessary to point out that faults and other troubles may exist
by which these estimates may be modified, but the dip of the Devonian beds to

the south, as determined b}' the deep boring made at Meux's Brewery, London,

affords a strong confirmation of their general truth.

     The strike of the beds would suggest a locality somewhat west of Enfield Lock

--possibly near the town of Enfield or JS'ew Barnet as the most promising spot for

a trial boring.

2. On the Formation of Heef Knolls. Bij R. H. Tiddemax, M.A., F.G.S.

                                                         Geological Survey.]

    At the meeting of the British Association at Newcastle iu 1889 I brought out

my interpretation of the probable origin of the limestone knolls of Yorkshire.^

It was shown that the Lower Carboniferous Rocks in the North of England

had two distinct types-- that the Yoredale or Northern type extended from the

Craven Faults to the Tyne, and that the Southern or Bowiand type occupied the

country from the Craven Faults to near the Western Seaside plain and extended

south as far as Derbyshire. Without now recalling the two tables of the succes-

sion there given, I mentioned specially the curious construction of certain mounds

of limestone, which I called reef-knolls, and gave my reasons for supposing that they

bad been gradually built up on a slowly sinking sea bottom by the gradual

accretion of animal remains, somewhat in a similar manner to coral reefs. I also

showed that from the enormously disproportionate thickness of rocks in the area

of the ddwtithrow side and from other considerations there was every reason to

su'p'p'os'e^that the Craven Faults were actJually taking place during the formation of

thosefr'c'ckg.                                                                                                                                                                                                .  ,.,.,..                        »i

my geological iliapping aa for the most part correct, found reasons for dissenting

with all the groundwork on which it was founded.^

In combating Mr. Marr's views I offer no opinion on knolls of other localities or

other ages which he brings forward in support of his views. I speak only of the

Carboniferous knolls of which I have written, and with which I am well
acquainted. Speaking generally, I think the differences between us may he thus

summarised

    1. Mr. Marr disagrees with my reading of the succession and thickness of the

rocks on the south side of the Craven Faults, and, whilst 1 consider that we have

two distinct successions of different thickness caused by a difference in the rate of

submergence in the two districts, and by shallower and deeper seas, he regards the

rocks on both sides as having been one st-ries of like tliickuess in orderly sequence

to the north, but, so to speak, shuffled by earth movements on the south of those

faults and repeated several times by over-thrusts.

In illustration let us take a pack of cards, say arranged in suits as repre-

senting the regular country on the north side, and several packs similarly ai'ranged

to represent the greater thickness on the south side. Shuffle these last to repre-

sent the supposed disturbance and over-thrusting. Shall we always find after

shuffling the same general succession ? Yet over a tract reaching from Draughton

to Chipping and from Settle to Derbyshire, we do get such a general succession,

and that does not at all resemble the succession on the north side of the faults.
The over- thrusting to do this effectually must cover the whole of this wide area

comprised in three or four counties and not confine its operations to a narrow

disturbed belt near the Craven Faults. Is Mr. Marr prepared to make his orogenic
movements extend over so large an area, and thereby arrange the whole country,

which they break up, into so orderly a disposition ?

2. Mr. Marr regards the great difference between the black and white lime-

stone, the form and constitution of the reef-knolls, the abundance in them of

perfect fossil forms in a well-preserved state, the conglomerates and breccias which

accompany them,     as all being the result of  what  he calls  orogenic  movements                                                         iu
                                                                                                                                         ;

other words, of the folding, repetition, and over-thrusting of the rocks, with here

ejiil there reliff of pressure. More especially is the last called in as being the

reason for the abundant and well-preserved fossils and the change of the lime-

stones.

    It is extremely difficult for me to accept these views. If we could believe that

a black, well and thinly bedded limestone can by any physical change be converted

into a white crystalline mass with little visible bedding, but with abundant fossils

in a perfect state, we have still to learn what has become of the shales which are

almost always present with the black limestone. If squeezed out, as might be

suggested, they would at least leave partings behind, and the rock would be more

bedded than it is.

     Mr. Marr contemplates the likelihood of several different limestones being

shifted together to make one reef-knoll, but if so, are we not as likely to get the
thin sandstones of the Pendleside Grit sandwiched into them as welli* Yet
sandstones and shale-beds are unknown in the reef-knolls.

Mr. Marr makes a number of statements about what he calls the Vs of the

Middle Craven Fault, His opinion is that this is a great thrust plane dipping

gently north, and that the Coal-measures are forced beneath the limestone, and so

Aon along its course.  bed of coal in the limestone at Ingleton is regarded by

him as having been forced up from imderlying Coal-measures by pressure, and not

as originally interbedded. Unfortunately for these views, there are no proper Vs

or dipping planes of faulting indicated in the map. The sinuous track of the
Craven Fault is not so drawn to accommodate any theory, but is merely put where
the exposures of rock show it to run. Its wanderings are either dictated by or
stand iu relation to the two principal lines of jointing in the limestone, which

range W.N.W. and N.N.W. Sometimes one direction, sometimes the other, has
the mastery. At Clapham the line is absolutely straight, and does not curve up

stream as suggested by Mr. Marr. The coal seam mentioned is well known to me.
On searching it I found several Product! fairly perfect embedded in it and filled
with it, and the conclusion I came to was that it was either a coal-seam which had
grown on a reef and been submerged, or a deposit of seaweed. These Producti
seem to disagree with the injection theory. Such coal-seams are found occasionally
in the limestone. One near Kirkby Lonsdale has been worked for coal.

     Mr. MaiT has mentioned two places where knolls of grit occur. I do not admit
that a knoll of grit can have anything in common with the reef knolls of Craven
unless it be the external form ; but if such structures were made by earth thrusts
and abounded, it would no doubt be a strong point in favour of his views. One of
these grit knolls is said to be in the canal at the back of Sliipton Castle. I think
this must be an error. I know of no sandstone in that locality, though I know it

well. I have consulted others who are, as geologists conversant with Shipton,
competent to form an opinion, and they agree with me that nothing but limestone

and shales occurs in that canal at that point. The beds there are certainly con-
torted, but not sandstone, and contortions do not necessarily imply reef-knolls.

     I feel unable to regard Mr. Marr's ' model knoll ' as in any respect resembling
what I have called reef-knolls. That is, according to his views, a broken plication
of a thin hard bed of limestone in a mass of softer shale, the ."hale surrounding its
broken fragments. The knolls to which I allude are almost solid limestone from
top to ba.se. They have no alternations of hard and soft beds, and, so far as I have
seen, no repetition of beds by folding. The evidences of movement on their flanks,
if any, are not more than one would expect from the vertical pressure of a more or
less plastic shale upon what is at least a less plastic limestone.

     1 admit fully that there are abundant evidences in the district of faulting, of
great pressure, and quite likely of over-thrusts ; but to say that these have given to
these rocks a change of character, or are responsible for the order of their succes-

sion, appears to me to be invoking an unnecessarily powerful but yet inadequate

force. Such thrust-planes as are implied would meet the geologist in the field at
every turn, and force themselves into recognition. Tliey would admit of easy
mapping, and no statement of their existence can be complete without some such

systematic recognition.

            3. On the Construction and Uses of Strike Maps.
                       By J. LoMAs, A.R.C.S., F.G.S.

In studying the deformations which a series of rocks have undergone, we are

apt to regard the vertical movements as all-important, and neglect the horizontal

movements to which they have been subjected. This is largely owing to the

difficulties experienced in picturing such horizontal movements and representing

them on a plan.

Lines dependent on surface inequalities confuse the worker when he seeks to

use the ordinary geological maps for this purpose.

It is easy to get rid of these lines by projecting the strikes of the beds on to a

Wehorizontal plane.  then have the appearance that would be produced if the

country were planed down to a horizontal surface. The outcrops would coincide

with the strikes, and any deviation from straight lines would indicate horizontal

movements.

Vertical movements would also be shown on such a plan by the closing up of

outcrops of beds of equal thickness.

All the necessary data necessary to represent these features on a strike map

are given in the ordinary Geological Survey Sheets.

    To construct such a map, first trace the dips given on the geological map and

draw short lines at the points of the arrows, at right angles to the direction of dip.

   We Nowthus have represented the strikes of the beds at a number of points.

it is necessary to connect these up by lines to show the strike at intermediate

places.

It would not be safe to connect one line with another, as the strikes may refer

to difierent beds.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.           743

     In order to overcome this difficulty, draw a series of lines parallel to the

strike line ou both sides of it. On doing this for all the positions it will be found
that the lines either connect themselves in linear series, or we have represented a
series of tangents to curves which become evident when the lines are prolonged in

the direction of the strike. Care should be taken not to connect in the same line

strikes with dips in contrary directions, and it is well to represent the dip side of

the strike lines by a short mark  '

When the amount of dip is known, as well as the direction, we can represent

the steepness of the folds by suitable shading, either by hachures or closeness of

strike lines.

    As an illustration I exhibit strike maps of the district about Clitheroe, including
the well-known knolls at VVorsa and Gerna. The anticlinal ridge just north of
Oliatburn is clearly shown, and the strata dipping with wavy folds towards the

Kibble on the north and Clitheroe on the south.
     The Salt Hill quarries are excavated in this southern slope at a place where

the fold becomes acute.

    The knolls at Worsa and Gerna appear like whirls or eddies such as may be
seen in a stream when the flow is obstructed by boulders in the stream bed.

4. On Eapid Changes in the Thickness and Character of the Coal Measures
                 of North Staffordshire. By W. Gibson, F.G.S.

 H[Communicated by permission of the Director-General of M. Geological SurVey.]

      Variability in thickness and character of the strata is universal throughout the
Carboniferous period, but is nowhere more marked in the Midlands than in the coal-
field of the North Statibrdsbire Potteries

     This important coalfield consists of two portions. On the east the productive

measures lie in a well-marked syncline, while on the west the strata rise in a sharp
anticline extending from Silverdale to Talke. The two productive areas are
separated by a strip of ground two and a half miles broad, composed of barren
upper measures.

   A notable difference in the thickness of the strata and nature of the coal seams

characterises these structurally distinct areas. In the centre of the syncline, near
Shelton, the vertical distance between the highest ironstone, or summit of the
productive measures, to the BuUhurst coal, or lowest workable seam, is about

1,.300 yards. On the anticline at Apedale only 800 j'ards of strata separate the
same horizons. This makes a remarkable decrease in tliickness of 500 yards of
strata in a distance of under three miles. The reduction in thickness westward of

the productive measures is continued, though in a less degree, in the upper barren
series, but owing to the absence of shaft sections the amount cannot be definitely
statsd It is known, however, that the red marls forming the lower portion of
the upper barren j-eries are more than 1,000 feet thick near Etruria station on the
Shelton property, and about 850 leet thick near Silverdale, on the south-eastern

limb of the anticline. With the decrease in thickness a change has takt-n place in
the lower coals of the productive series. The seams which are house or steam coals

on the east change into gas and coking coals on the west.
     This great variability seems to show that separate areas of deposit were being

marked out by local movements of elevation and depression, and thus fulfilling iu
North Staffordshire the conditions characteristic of the Carboniferous of the
Midlands generally, as pointed out by Prof. Lapworth.^

    In North Statlordshire it happens that the areas of maximum and minimum

deposit correspond with a syncline and anticline. If this is true generally, and not

merely a local coincidence, we may expect the coals in the unexplored coalfield

which lies at the surface to the west of the anticline, and which represents the

measures will be increased.

          6. Suggestions in regard to the Registration of Ti/ioe-fossils.

                              By Rev, J. F. Blake.

     Whereas

    1. There is now in existence, and has been for some time, a Committee of the

British Association ' to consider the best methods for the registration of all type
specimens of fossils in the British Isles.'

     2. There is as yet in course of production no general register of such
specimens.

     3. The original types are in many, perhaps the majority of, cases either lost,

inaccessible, or inadequately preserved or described.

    4. Many names in common use have a foreign origin which have not been

adopted after actual comparison with the original foreign types.
      5. Palffiontoloffical nomenclature consequently still remains burdened with

names of uncertain value.

      It is therefore advisable that

     1. The above-named Committee recognise and register a new class of ' types,'
which may be either original or adopted, but which satisfy certain conditions laid
down to insure their having a definite value.

    A2. register be published annually of such types, so that an author in using a

name may have the option of quoting this register, instead of the original author's

name.

     3. This register should give references (1) to the author or authors, and their

publications thereupon, who have first satisfied the required conditions; (2) to the
museum where the type is deposited.

     4. The limitation of types, registered by the British Associatio7i, should have
reference to the type specimens, whatever their origin, which are deposited in
museums within the United Kingdom (possibly to be enlarged at a future date to

the British Empire).

     5. The Committee should, from time to time, determine the conditions required
for registration, but should be iu no way responsible for the validity of the

' species ' to which the type may be said to belong, or for the name under which
it is registered, which registration should apply to the ' specific ' name only and

not be affected by its reference later to another genus ; the only care of the
Committee, beyond seeing that the required conditions are satisfied, being to secure
that identical diagnoses are not registered under different names, and that the same
name is not used at different times for different diaernoses.

      The suggested conditions for registration are as follows

    A1. single specimen must be selected as the type, but two or more co-types

may be admitted, which are identical in all other respects than the preservation of

 different necessary characters.

      2. The exact horizon and locality of the specimen thus selected must be
 known.

      3. All the commonly called 'specific ' characters required, in the class to which
 it belongs, must be known by the type or by the co-types together, and also

--described, and also the generic ones when the genus is not obvious. [N.B. The

 determination whether this condition is carried out in any particular case will rest
 with the member of the Committee charged with the class.]

      4. All characters, capable of numerical statement, including size, proportion of

parts or lines, angle, &c., must be so given. [N.B.--Adequate figures may suffice

for this.]

     5. The type specimen must be permanently placed in a public museum in the

United Kingdom.

    N.B.--It is not necessary that the type specimen in the above sense should be

the first anywhere described under the registered name, but only the first that
satisfies the above conditions.

    B BIt is suggested that registered types should be quoted as 1, 13-- e.g.
B BTerebratula bijylicata, 1, or Phacops caudatus, 13--B standing for British,

and the number for that of the year of the century. Specimens ditferiug notably
from the type, but included in the same species, might be quoted as (B 1).

[Communicated by permission of the Director-General of H.M. Geological Survey.]

     The ferruginous and oolitic limestones known as the Elsworth and St. Ives
Rocks are now generally believed to be one and the same, an opinion supported by

my own work in that district recently. The limestone in question has long been

known to occur at St. Ives in brick-pits, being well exposed to the west of the

town. It was known also to occur throughout the village of Elsworth. Mr.
Cameron noticed a fossiliferous rock outcropping near Hilton, between Elsworth
and St. Ives. No other surface exposures were known, but a similar rock was

found in the railway cutting at Bluntisham, north-east of St. Ives, at Swavesey,

east of the same place, and Bourn, south of Elsworth, and a few other localities,
and like rock was found in Wells.

The outcrop can be traced almost continuously from a mile west of the brick-

yard at St. Ives, striking eastwards along the northern flank of the Oiise valley,

and passing north  of St.  Ives to  Needingworth                                                           here it bends abruptly southwards
                                                                                                        ;

to Holywell and forms a gentle rise. The southern part of the village of Holywell

stands on a gravel-capped escarpment of the rock; a collection of fossils in the

Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge, agreeing closely with those of the Elsworth

and St. Ives Rocks, was believed to have come from Holywell. East of Holywell

the outcrop must cross the Ouse valley ; I found traces of the rock in a drain some

distance west of Swavesey. From here, south-westwards, it is not seen again till

it appears at the surface between Hilton and Coningron, where a rock was noted
by Mr. Cameron. Southwards from here the outcrop crosses a valley to tlie rising

ground west of Elsworth, through which village a narrow tongue of the rock runs

still further south. The main outcrop, however, flanks the northern slope of the

drift-capped high ground to the west, and can be traced along the slope through
Papworth Everard, westwards to Yelling, following the contour of the ground.

At both of these localities there are good and highly fossiliferous exposures in

streams. Thence the outcrop disappears southwards under drift, but the rock may

be seen again to the south, less than two miles south of Croxton, in a ditch in the

valley of the Abbotsley Brook.

    To the north, east, and south-east of the line of outcrop of this limestone, the
ground is occupied by Ampthill clay, to the west by Oxford clay. It will thus be

seen that the Elsworth and St. Ives Rocks, besides agreeing closely in their fauna,

outcrop along the same line of strike, with Ampthill clay above and Oxford clay
below. The dip is always small, and the rock at Bluntisham, if it reaches the

surface at all, does so probably as an inlier, though it maybe directly connected at

the surface with the outcrop east of St. Ives.

   A Kjoint Discussion with Section on the Conditions under which the Plants

of the Coal Period grew was opened by the reading of the following Papers :

                  Flora of the Coal-measures. By R. Kidston.

    Leaving out of consideration for the meantime a few genera of which we

possess little or no definite kaowledge, the flora of the Coal-measures consists of
Fer72S, Calamites, Li/copods, Splienophyllem, Cordaites, and Conifcrce.

     In genera and species the ferns are probably more numerous than the whole of
the other groups, and contain representatives of the Eusporangiate and Lepto-
sporangiate members of the class. The Eusporangiate, or those ferns whose
sporangia are unprovided with an annulus, were more numerous in the Carboni-
ferous period than at present, though in the Coal-measures they do not appear to
have been more numerous than the genera with annulate sporangia. Tree ferns,
though not very common, are more frequent in the Upper than in the Lower
Coal-measures, in the lowest beds of which they seem to be very rare.

     The Calamites are largely represeuted throughout the whole of the Coal-
measures, A&terophyllites (^Calamocladus) and Annularia probably being their

foliage.

     Lycopods are also very numerous, and are represented by many important

genera Lycopodites, Lepidodendro7i, LejndopJdoios, Bothrodendron, and Siyillaria,
with their rhizomes Stiymaria and IStiymariopsis. These genera contributed
largely to the formation of Coal.

     The genus Splienojjkyllujn was also frequent during Co.al-measure times, and
forms a type of vegetation essentially distinct from any existing group.

     The Gymnosperms are represented by Cordaites, Coniferce, and Cycads.
     The Cordaites had tree-like trunks and long yucca-like leaves. They are
plentiful in the Coal-measures, and, like the arborescent lycopods, must have been a

prominent feature in a Carboniferous forest-scene.
     The Conifercc, so far as I have seen, are only represented by a single specimen

of Walchia from the Upper Coal-measures ; and though Cycads have been discovered

in the Upper Coal-measures on the Continent, I am not aware of any British

species which can be referred with certainty to this group.

                   The Origin of Coal. By A. Strahan, M.A.

The deposition of the Coal-measures was due to the subsidence of large por-

tions of the earth's crust to a depth often amounting to several thousand feet.

The subsidence, being unequal, led to the formation of coal-basins, parts of the

margins of which are still recognisable. That the intervening areas rose no

less rapidly than the basins sank is proved by the vast denudation suflered by the

earlier Palaeozoic rocks during the Carboniferous period.

The subsidence was counterbalanced, during Coal-measure times by sedimenta-

tion, for the occurrence of marine beds among deposits of a generally estuarine

aspect proves that the surface was maintained at or near sea-level. The

Carboniferous sediments consist, in the majority of coal-fields, of marine limestones

in the lower part, of marine grits and conglomerates in the middle part, and of

estuaro-marine sandstones and shales in the upper part. The sequence is due,

firstly,  to  the  admission  of  the  sea  to  the  subsiding  areas                            and  lastly,  to  the
                                                                                              ;

restoration of level brought ahout by sedimentation and denudation. But there

is evidence also of the sedimentation having been more or less spasmodic. Thus

the Limestone Series generally consists of repetitions of small groups of strata,
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                    747

 each group beiutr composed of sandstone, followed bv shale, shale followed by

 limestone. Similarly the Coal-measures present repetitions of sandstone followed
by shale, shale by coal. Limestone in the one case and coal in the other are

therefore comparable in the respect that each represents an episode when sedimen-
tation had come to a pause. Early views as to the orij^in of coal, namely, that it
was formed of vegetable matter drifted beyond the region to which the iinest
mineral sediment could reach, were in accordance with these facts.

      More_ minute examination of the strata, however, revealed proofs of land-

surfaces in the Coal-measures, and it was generally accepted that the coal-seams
represent forests in the place of their growth. The evidence may be summarised

as follows:

     1. Rain-pittings, sun-cracks, and footprints prove that the surfaces of some of
the beds were exposed to the air.

t.'. Erect tree-trunks of large size, in some cases attached to laro-e spreading

roots, are not uncommon. Land-shells, millipedes, and the skeletons of air-
breathing reptiles have occasionally been found within the hollow trunks.
3. The underclays of coal-seams are traversed in all directions by branching

rootlets, unlike the drifted fragments in the bedding planes of the other strata"
Ihey were described as an invariable accompaniment of coals, and as bein<'
the soils in which the coal-forest was rooted.                                         '^

     4. Coal-seams, with thin minute partings, persist over vast areas, and it was
thought impossible that so wide and regular a distribution of the vegetable matter
could have been accomplished by drifting.

     5. The chemical composition of the coals was believed to prove that the ve^re-
table matter underwent partial decomposition in the open air before bein?
submerged or buried.

This evidence, however, though it proves the existence of land surfaces, is not
conclusive of the coal-seams being forests in place of growth. The rain-pittings
sun-cracks, and footprints occur, not in the coals, but in the intervening strata.
Ut the erect tree-trunlcs a large proportion occur in sandstones devoid of coal, a
lew only having been found to stand upon an underclay, or to be associated with
seams ot coal. Vast areas of coal have been worked without any such trunks
having been encountered. The majority of the trunks, moreover, are destitute of
spreading roots, and are believed to have been floated to their present positions.
1 he land-shells, insect and reptilian remains, are of extremely rare occurrence.
     Ihe underclays do not resemble soils, inasmuch as they are perfectly homo-
geneous, and he with absolute parallelism to the other members of a stratified
series. Ihey are not always present beneath coal-seams, but, on the other hand,
often occur in them or above them. Frequently thev have no coal associated with
them.^ Ihe rootlets in them have no connection with the coal, which is a well-
stratined deposit with a sharply defined base.

The persistence of the partings and characters of the coal over wide areas is in
favour ot their being subaqueous deposits, for on so
must have been river-systems and variations in the    large an excanse  of land there

SUl ItlCGS,

Sub-aerial decomposition of part of a mass of vegetable matter would take place
whether It were floating or resting on dry land. Spores, which enter largely into the
composition of many coals, would travel long distances either by wind or water.
     .Some coal-seams show clear proof
which are made up of a mass of small    of a drifted   origin, as, for example, those
                                        water-worn
                                                      chips of wood or bark. Other
seams pass horizontally into bands of ironstone, and one case has been observed
ot a coal changing gradually into a dolomitic tufa, doubtless formed in a stagnant
lagoon, rutting aside exceptional cases, the sequence of events which preceded
t.ie deposition of a normal coal-seam seems to have been--firstly, the outspreadinP-
of sand or gravel with drifted plant-remains, followed by shale as the currenti
lost ^ elocity. J he water was extremely shallow, and even retreated at times, so
as to leave the surface open to the air. The last sediments were extremely fine,
748 REPORT-- 1900.

homogeneous, and almost wholly siliceous, and in them a mass of presumably
aquatic vegetation rooted itself. This further impediment to movement in the
water cut off all sediment, and the material brought into the area then consisted only
of wind-borne vegetable dust or floating vegetable matter carrying an occasional
boulder. Lastly, the formation of the coal-seam was brought to a close by a sudden
invasion of the area by moving water. The mass of vegetable matter, often after
suffering some little erosion, was buried by sandstone or shale rich in large
drifted remains of plants or trees, and the whole process was recommenced.

     Botanical Evidence heariiig on the Climatic and other Physical
  Conditions tender which Coal was formed. By A. C. Seward, F.R.S.

     Botanical investigations into the nature and composition of the vegetation

·which has left abundant traces in the sediments of the Coal-measures may be ex-

pected to throw some light on the natural conditi-ms which prevailed during that
period in the earth's history that was par excellence tue age of coal production.
The minute examination of petrified tissues has rendered possible a restoration of
the internal framework of several extinct types of plant-life, and has carried us a
step further towards the solution of evolutionary problems. It is possible, even
with our present knowledge, to make a limited use of anatomical structure as an
index of life-conditions, and to restore in some degree from structural records the
physiological and physical conditions of plant-life characteristic of the close of the

Carboniferous epoch.

           I. Evidence furnished by the Coal-period Floras as to Climatic and

tion as a factor ailecting the consideration of such comparisons. The possible exist-
ence of a Palaeozoic Mountain flora of which no records have been preserved.

3. The Plutonic Complex of Cnoc-na-Sroine and its Bearing on Current

    Hypotheses as to the Genesis of Igneous Hocks. By J. J. H. Teall,

      M.A., F.R.S., Pres.G.S.

     The plutonic complex of Cnoc-na-Sroine begins about five miles south of
Inchnadampf, in Sutherlandshire, and extends in a south-easterly direction for
about five miles, with an average width of about one mile. It is bounded on the
north and south by peat-covered tracts, and is, therefore, more extensive than is
indicated by the above figures. It lies in the disturbed zone. The main outcrop
of the Ben More thrust lies to the east, but outliers of rocks above this thrust
occur to the north and west. The plutonic rocks were intruded into the Durness
limestone series, which is locally altered at the junctions to a marble containing
silicates of lime and magnesia.

     The central part of the mass is a red soda-granite or quartz-syenite,^ mainly
composed of orthoclase and albite (or a closely allied lelspar), with which a little
quartz is associated. Ferro-magnesian minerals are almost entirely absent. The
peripheral portions are more basic, and include s)-euites, augite-syenites, nepheline-

syenites, and the peculiar rock to wliich the term borolanite has teen applied.

These hasic border rocks are richer in lime, iron, map:nesia, and titanic acid, though

still containing alkali felspar and nepheline. This is proved by the occurrence of

biotite, segirine-augite, melauite, and sphene.

     There are three possible ways in which the complex may have originated :

(1)  successive                                    intrusions                                        (2) differentiation iw sjfw ;  and  (3)  modification  of the

original magma by the absorption of material from the adjacent limestones or

dolomites.

     The fact that transitional forms between the main types are abundant seems

to suggest that successive intrusions of sharply differentiated magmas have not

played an important part in the building up of the complex. The formation of a

border facies of basic rocks, richer in lime and magnesia, can be explained by

absorption from the adjacent limestones or dolomites, but the enrichment in iron

and titanic acid, as represented by the frequent abundance of melanite and sphene,

cannot bo so accounted for. The evidence at present available suggests that

differentiation, coupled, it may be, with some absorption of material from the

adjacent sedimentaries, has been the main agent in forming the complex

     But, however the complex may have originated, it is certain that the magmas

representing the more acid and the more basic portions appear outside the plutonic

area as dykes and sills. Thus to the north there are felsitie rocks containin"'

aegirine closely allied in composition to the quartz-syenites, and in the Coigach

district of West Ross-shire, about seventeen miles to the west of Cuoc-na-Sroine,

there are dykes of borolanite.

     The main object of this communication is to call attention to the extremely

--interesting petrographical province unique so far as the British Islands are
--concerned of which Cnoc-na-Sroine forms a part, and to the problems connected

with it which still await solution.

4. On a Granophyre-dyke Intrusive in the Gahhro of Ardnamurclian,
              Scotland. By Professor K. Busz, of Milnster.

     Similar contact-phenomena to those already known of Barnavave in Ireland

and of Strath on the isle of Skye have been found near the village of Kilhoan

on Ardnamurchan, where a granophyre-dyke, intrusive in a surrounding mass of

gabbro, has not only eflected alterations of the gabbro, but Jxas also undergone

alterations in its own composition through the absorption of basic material.

     The gabbro occurs in two varieties, the one being a fine sugar-grained black

rock, without any macroscopically visible structure, the other showing a porphy-

ritic structure and containing small black crystals or crystalline ao-Teo'ates of

triclinic felspar.

  --They both consist of anorthite, pyroxene diallage and common augite and

magnetite                                          rhombic pyroxene in considerable                  quantity is                         also present  in  the por-
                                                ;

phyritic variety.

     On the junction line, where the granophyre and gabbro meet, all constituents

have been greatly altered. The triclinic felspar gradually passes into orthoclase

and the alteration-product of pyroxene is hornblende (usually uralite), brown mica,

and secondary granular augite.

     The granophyre consistsof quartz generally in well-defined crystals and of

grey orthoclase, which serves as interstitial matter. It also contains a great

number of rectangular felspar crystals, the centre of which in many cases consists

of triclinic felspar (gabbro-xenocrysts). It appears spotted with numerous black

patches of different size, mostly minute, which are the remains of pvroxene-xeno-

crysts, originated from the gabbro and showing every stage of alteration.

     The results of the examination of these rocks lead to the following conclusions;

     1. The gabbro is presumably a dyke-rock, belonging to the group- which has

been termed beerbachitft, and also partly a porphyritic variety of the same--6eer6a-

chite-porj^hyry.

     2. It was solidified before the iatrusion of the granophyre, as the latter contains
--752 EEPORT 1900.

a great number of xenoliths of it, whicli through the acid magma have undergone

great alterations.

     3. The granophyre has ahsorhed a considerable quantity of the basic material,
thereby altering its own composition and effecting the crystallisation of hornblende
and mica, two constituents which we have to consider as not belonging to the
original granophyre magma.

     4. In the solidification of the granophyre two stages can be distinguislied, the

first giving rise to the formation of the rectangular orthoclase crystals, whicli
crystallised in parallel intergrowth with the plagioclase-xenocrysts, the second
forming a kind of groundmass in which fresh quartz crystallised, while the ortho-
clase filled up the remaining spaces.

  K1, On Naiadita /rom the Upper Rhceiic (Bed of Wilson's Section) of

           Redland, near Bristol. By Igebna B. J. Sollas, B.Sc.

     The plant remains known as Naiadita are found in Rhsetic beds in the Severn
district below the Avon. Phillips mentions their occurrence at Tewkesbury,

Westbury-on-Severn, and Bristol.
     These fossils are well known from the description published fifty years ago by

Buckman. It was Buckman who chose for them the name Naiadita, because ho
considered them to be monocotyledonous plants resembling the members of the

order Naiadace£e.

      Mr. Starkie Gardner in 1886 re-examined them, and pointed out that the
markings taken by Buckman as having been left by the rectangular venation of a
Naias-like leaf were in reality fossilised cell-walls.

      Mr. Gardner concludes that the plant is a moss, and probably closely allied to

the genus Fontinalis. He speaks of a capsule, but of this he gives no description.

    A slab from the Naiadites bed of Pyll Hill, Bristol, was recently sent by

Mr. Wickes of that town to my father for examination, because it contains bodies
which were thought to be possibly gemmules of sponges. On this proving not to

be the case the specimen was handed over to me.
     The plant, which was delicate, slender, and moss-like in habit, is preserved in a

more or less fragmentary condition. 1 believe, however, that the parts are suf-
ficiently connected to show that the sporangia are situated at the bases of the leaves,
between their upper surfaces and the stem. The stems branch laterally, and a
sporangium is often to be seen near a point of branching.

     The shapes of the leaves are various, and this has led Buckman to establish
three distinct species. No doubt there may be more than one species present, but
certainly leaves of at least two difi'erent shapes are to be seen attached to one and

the same piece of stem, viz., small obovate leaves and larger ones of an elongate

 elliptical shape.

     The epidermal cell-walls are preserved and their outlines are very clear. The

cells are long and rectangular, fchorteuing towards the bases of the leaves. No

 stbmata are to be seep.
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                             753

     The capsules are more or less spherical, and measure 0'7o mm. iu diameter.
Those which are broken are seen to contain a granular mass of spores. The more

perfect capsules have a wall which appears tessellated, as it is composed of small

quadrate cells.

     Sections of the capsules show that the spores are still connected into tetrads
by the spore mother cell-walls. The coats of the spores are covered with minute
bosses. The sporangium wall is at least one cell layer thick.

     Sections of the vegetative parts do not reveal any details of structure, but some

points may be made out by simply rubbing down on a hone. Long tubes filled

up with oxide of iron lying in the axes of the stems are all that is preserved of the

internal tissues. The tubes may occasionally be found sending a branch to a leaf.
     The nature and position of the sporangia and their contents suggest that

Naiadita had affinities with Lycopods rather than with mosses.

    On this account I searched thoroughly for stomata, as structures confirmatory
of the sporophytic nature of the plant. The result of the search was, as I have

said, negative, and it is not surprising that this should be the case. The associated
fossils are freshwater forms, and the habits of the plant point to a submerged
existence. Mr. Gardner has already appreciated this fact in maintaining the close
kinship of Naiadita with Fontinalis. The submerged species of Isoetes show that
aquatic life in the case of Cryptogams leads to loss of stomata just as in that of

Phanerogams,

2 The Influence of the Winds upon Climate during Past Epochs : a

     Meteorological Explanation of some Geological Problems. By F. W.

      Harmer, F.G.S.

     This paper is in continuation of one read at Dover in 1899, on ' The Meteoro-
logical Conditions of North-western Europe during the Pliocene and Glacial

Periods.'

     The irregular distrihution of the isotherms in the northern hemisphere is
largely due to the direction of the prevalent winds. In regions where these are
constantly varying, as, for example, in Great Britain, the climate varies diurnally,
one day being often dry or cold, and the next rainy or warm. In others, where
the wind changes seasonally, one part of the year is rainless and another pluvial.
Permanent alterations in climate would equally result were the course of the pre-

valent winds permanently changed.

The direction of the winds, which must always be more or less parallel to the

isobars, depends on the relative position, and on the form and alignment of areas

of high and low barometric pressure. The movements of the latter being largely

interdependent, any important meteorological disturbance, however caused, may

make its influence felt at a considerable distance from the focus of its origin.

The winds blow round areas of high and low pressure ; outwards, from the

former, and to the north of the Equator, from left to right : and inwards, towards

tlio latter, from right to left. Hence, in the northern hemisphere, southerly

winds prevail to the east of a cyclonic centre, and northerly winds to the west of

it, the contrast between the temperature of the two being usually in proportion

to the distance the aerial currents may have travelled from the south and the

Warmnorth respectively.  and cold winds must therefore necessarily coexist,

causing differences in climate in countries having the same latitude. The winter

temperature of Hudson's Bay is, for example, 60^ F. colder than that of Great

Britain. Similar climatal conditions must also have existed during the Pleistocene

epoch.

     The continental regions of the northern hemisphere, being at present warmer
during summer than the ocean, are cyclonic ; in winter they are colder, and con-
sequently anticyclonic. Over the great ice-sheets of the Glacial period, however,

high pressure must have prevailed, more or less, at all season.^, and, generally, the

meteorological conditions, including the direction of the prevalent winds, and local

variations iu climatt must then have been widely different from those of our own

times. Oceanic winds, ·with copious rainfall, may have prevailed in regions now
arid and mild winters where they are now excessively severe. Such cases of

anomalous climate as those of the pluvial conditions of the Sahara, and of Arabia

and Persia, during the Pleistocene era, may be satisfactorily explained by the changes

in the relative positions of cyclonic and auticyclonic systems, which were caused by

the o-radual growth and disappearance of the great ice-sheets, as may be the

alternate humidity and desiccation of the great basin of Nevada, the former

existence of the mammoth on the shores of the Polar Sea, &c.

      It is difficult, however, to restore hypothetically the meteorological conditions

of the Pleistocene epoch, on the theory that the maximum glaciation of the eastern
and western continents was contemporaneous. At present, the influence of the

Gulf Stream and the south-west winds caused by the Icelandic cyclone carries in

winter a comparatively warm climate, and low pressures, northwards into the Arctic

Circle but no permanent ice-sheet could have existed in Great Britain under such

circumstances. In the opinion of Professor Jas. Geikie and of Dr. Buchan, the polar

basin was filled with ice, and therefore permanently anticyclonic, during the Glacial
epoch. Cyclones and anticyclones in regions more or less contiguous are, however,

necessarily complementary, in order that the vertical circulation of the atmosphere

may be maintained. The existence of an enormous polar anticyclone, extending

southwards over a great portion of Europe and North America, would have
involved also that of a cyclonic system of corresponding importance in the North
Atlantic, a region which must have been at all seasons warmer than thosecovered

with ice. If Europe and North America were glaciated at the same time, the

Icelandic cyclone, which now lies (statistically) in winter near to the south-east

coast of Greenland, would have been forced to the south ; but the further south it

went the warmer would have been the southerly winds which blew east of its centre
towards Great Britain and Western Europe. Conditions similar to those which

may have prevailed during the Glacial period occurred during the early part of

1899 for information as to which the author desires to acknowledge his indebted-

ness to Mr. W. N. Shaw, F.R.S., of the Meteorological Office. At that time a

great low- pressure system, which sometimes extended from Europe to America, and
from Iceland to the Canary Islands, occupied the North Atlantic. Vast volumes of
cold air were consequently poured over North America, and Western Europe was

Hooded by warm aerial currents from the sub-tropical zone. At the beginning of
February, temperatures of from -40° F. to -60° F. were commonly registered in

different parts of North America ; while at the same time the thermometer rose
in London to 66° F., in Liege to 70° F., and in Davos to 62° F., the average

maximum for that month at the latter place being 38° F. These coincident varia-

tions in the temporary climate of the northern hemisphere are directly traceable to

the same cause.                                                                                                                                          .  that      , ·,  and

    No meteorological difficulties arise if we  adopt the hypothesis                                                                                              glacial

intero'lacial periods alternated in the eastern and western continents. If the ice-

cap extended from Greenland to Scandinavia, the North Atlantic cyclone would

have been forced to the south-west, towards the American coast, producing warm

south-east winds over Labrador; if, on the contrary, it stretched from Greenland

to North America, the cyclone would have been driven in the direction of Europe,

causing mild weather in "the latter, as in the case just given.

Such a view aflbrds a simpler explanation of the geological facts than those

usually adopted. Instead of supposing that the climatic changes of the Great Ice

ao-e several times recurrent at intervals of a few thousand years only, were due to

astronomical causes, it is here suggested that the climate of the Pleistocene

epoch being uniformly colder than that of our own era, conditions of comparative
warmth oi"cold may have been local, as they now are, affecting the great conti-

nental areas at different periods.

   .3. Notes on some Redent Excavations in the Glacial Drift in Bradford.

                               By Jas. Monckman, D.Sc.

     The stream that flows through the Bradford Valley rises on the hills above
Thornton and flows in an easterly direction to the centre ot the__ town, where it
turns at right angles towards the"^ north and falls into the Aire at bhipley.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  755

     In the lower branch of the valley we find abundance of fj^lacial materials, which

 have been pushed up from the Aire by a branch of the Airedale glacier, and
among the rocks abundance of limestones.

     In the npper valley we do not find the same state of things; but, instead of the
limestones, are grits and sandstones, except along a line commencing at Leventhorpe

Hall (which is about three miles from the centre of the town), and passing through
Lidget Green, Grange Estate, Little Horton to Bankfoot, it forms a fairly straight

line, about tliree-quarters of a mile south of the Town Hall, at its nearest point.

      Behind Grange lioad, to the south, there is an extensive deposit, which has
been exposed to a depth of twenty-two feet in some places, and excellent oppor-

tunities afforded of examining the boulders, among which were found many speci-
mens of limestones, light-coloured and dark, banded and cherty, also a fair quantity

of Silurian grits.

     I afterwards found limestone at Hewenden, and Mr. Muff found it near Oxen-
hope ; there is also an immense deposit at Cowling.

     Thus -we find the same kind of deposits along a moderately straight line on the

south side of the Aire Valley.

     The presence of the Silurian pebbles appears to indicate that, as there is no
rock on the south of the Aire from which they could be derived, the Ilibblesdale
ice "was forced over into Airedale, and that the moraine formed from tho grits and
slates of Ingleborough became the southern one in the Aire Valley.

     The grit boulders to the south of this line are of the same character as the
strata forming the hills on that side of the valley, and were probably carried by

smaller local streams of ice.

     4. On a Glacial ' Extra-morainic ' Lake occupying the Valley of the
                         Bradford Beck. By J. E. Wilson.

      In the paper read by the late Professor H. Carvill Lewis before the Geological

Section at Manchester in 1887 on the Extra-morainic Lakes of Central England
and elsewhere, he pointed out that the Aire glacier was the cause of three lakes

one in the neighbourhood of Skipton, towards Bolton Abbey; one due to the
damming up of the Bradford Beck ; and one in the valley of the Worth. The present
paper is the outcome of an endeavour to verify these observations of Professor
 Lewis. The proof of the existence of the Aire glacier and of its extension need
not detain us further than to point out out that glacial strife occur on both sides
of the Aire Valley, and are seen about the outlet of the Bradford Beck at Wind-
Iiill, and that boulder clay containing scratched limestones is frequent in the Brad-

ford area. Any glacier in the Aire Valley which extended on to the slopes of

Idle Hill, the northern point of the ridge which bounds the Bradford basin to the
east, would block up the mouth of the Bradford Valley. This ridge has an altitude
above the sea at Idle Hill of 750 tVet, and gradually decreases in heio-ht as far as
Laisterdyke, afterwards rising again to the southward. The lowest point of the
lip of the Bradford basin is marked by the dip through which the Great Northern
Railway extends out of Bradford at Laisterdyke. In the event of a block in the
valley between Heaton and Idle Hill this would naturally be the outlet of the
lake so produced. The height of the col at Laisterdyke is about 560 feet above

the sea.

     It would be very unlikely that one would find in a district like this, either
much built over or under cultivation, anything in the way of beaches or terraces.
But at several points beds of sand and sandy clay have been observed, and these
occur at levels of about 650 feet. The most striking is a deposit of sand and silt
showing extremely good current-bedding, on the hill opposite Leaventhorp Mill,
towards AUerton, and also in the neighbourhood of tlie mill itself. The mode
of its occurrence and its appearance suggest a delta deposit, and it is at exactly
such an altitude as would fit with the presence of a lake having an outlet at
Laisterdyke. The difficulty occurs, however, that the stream flowing in the valley
separating the two patches of current-bedded material has a much smaller drainage

                                                                                    3c2
                                                                --

--756 REPORT 1900.

area than Thornfcou Beck, of whlda it is a tributary, and ia the Thornton Beck

Valley similar deposits are very poorly represented.

     To explain this a consideration of the lakes to the westward is necessary.
Althouo;h Professor Carvill Lewis only inferred lakes in the Bradford area and in

-- --the Haworth area, there is a valley that of the Harden Beck ^between them,

which also maintained its lake. The Uhellow Dean reservoirs of the Bradford
Corporation are situated in a deep narrow valley, the rivulet originally flowing
down it having its rise in a drainage area of only about three-quarters of a mile

equare, an area wholly inadequate to account for the valley. Its upper part is in
fact a deep notch in the ridge, which would form the outlet of the Cullingworth
lake, and is at a height of 720 feet. The presence of this lake would account for
bads of current-bedded silt at Sandbeds, near Cullingworth, at exactly this level.

But in the valley below Chellow Dean hardly any traces of delta deposits have

--been observed at the level of Lake Bradford that is, on the same level as the

Leaventhorp beds. If, however, the extension of the Aire glacier blocked up the
notch at Chellow Dean, the outlet of the lake would be at the next lowest col
that near Stream Head Farm, 870 feet above the sea. The valley below Stream

Head Col soon becomes a deep narrow gorge similar in many respects to that at
Chellow Dean, and it is on either side of this valley, when it reaches the level of
Lake Bradford, that the delta deposit above referred to is found. The position of
this large deposit would therefore be explained if it is regarded as the result

of the erosion of the valley above by the water from the extensive drainage areas

of the Worth and Harden Beck pouring over the Stream Head Col. The material
carried down by the beck and arrested in its course on reaching Lake Bradford
would be deposited just where the Leaventhorp beds occur. Corroborative evi-
dence of the presence of a lake at the level of the Stream Head Col is possibly
provided by the occurrence of current-bedded sand exposed in a gravel pit at
Hallas Rough Park at about the level of the col.

    On the other hand, the absence of delta deposits from the Chellow Dean Beck
would be explained if it is ciinsidered that possibly, when the extension of the
glacier was such that the Chellow Dean Col was open, the size of the glacier was
not sufBcient to wholly block the mouth of the Bradford Valley. In this case the
water would escape by its present outlet, and no lake would exist to arrest the
material brought down from the ravine of Chellow Dean.

    At the period when the Chellow Dean Col was open there would be two lakes

to the westward, one in the Cullingworth Valley, above mentioned, and one in the
Worth Valley. The outlet of the latter would be a deep notch at Sugden End,
near Haworth, at 720 feet ; but as the Stream Head Col is at a greater height than
this, the two lakes would be merged into one large lake when the Chellow Dean
Col was blocked, so that for this period Professor Carvill Lewis's theory would
be correct.

  5. A Preliminary Note on the Glaciation of the Keighley and Bradford
      District. By Albert Jowett, M.Sc., and Herbert B. Muff.

                       1. General Vieiu of the Surface Features of the Area.

    The general trend of the Aire Valley in this district is from N.W. to S.E.
Actually, the valley makes a number of roughly rectangular bends, receiving a

large tributary valley, from the south side, at each southern convexity, viz. : the

Glusburu Valley at liildwick, the Worth Valley at Keighley, the Harden Valley
at Bingley, and the Bradford Valley at Shipley. The valleys entering on the
north side are much smaller.

    The tributary valleys, of which the Worth Valley and the Bradford Valley

are the largest and most complex, have been excavated in the plateau of L'pper
Carboniferous rocks, of which the Millstone Grit here forms the Pennine water-
shed. The altitude of the watershed rarely exceeds 1,500 feet; there is a break
below 1,125 feet west of Haworth, and a broader depression below 900 feet
between Oolne and Kildwick. The ridges between the tributary valleys, on both

sides of the main valley, are cut at right angles iu many places by notches trend-
ing from N.W. to S.E.

                     2. Characteristics of the Olacial Deposits and Strice.

     Boulder Clay is found in many places throughout the area, and consists of a
tough blue clay which has a superticial covering of yellow sandy clay of very
variable thickness. The contained stones are chiefly Carboniferous limestone,

chert, grit, and sandstone, including gannister, together with shales and iron-
stone nodules. Occasional pre-Carboniferous grits and slates have been met with.
The limestone boulders become fewer in number and generally smaller in size

as we proceed down the main valley, and also as we approach the periphery of

the area from the main valley. Boulders of the other rocks are also found to the
.south-east of their solid outcrops. Most of the boulders in the blue clay are
beautifully moulded and striated. The yellow clay contains fewer limestones
than the blue, of which it appears to be simply the weathered crust.

      Gravel is often found above and at the margin of the boulder clay, and in
some places passes into current-bedded sands. Occasionally a section is seen
showing clay, sand, and gravel of all degrees of coarseness in interdigitating
layers. Sections at the lower ends of the spur-cutting notches above mentioned
have revealed current- bedded sands and gravels, &c., composed of materials similar
to the rocks exposed in the sides of the gorge above. Striae are most frequently
preserved on beds of grit which have a covering of clay ; one set was found on
gannister similarly preserved. In the case of the grit surfaces, not only are there
long parallel striations on the whole surface, but the larger quartz-pebbles are very
finely scratched in the same direction. The direction of the ice-movement was
deduced from the observation that surface irregularities were rounded and smoothed
on the one side, but rough on the other.

3. Maximum Extent and Direction of Movement of Glacier.

     The floor of the Glusburn Valley is covered with boulder clay which is con-
tinuous with and similar to the drift on the western side of the Pennine watershed

described by Mr. R. H. Tiddeman. On Cowling Moor, along ridge of unstratitied

gravel, 50 feet thick, is seen at an altitude of 1,150 feet O.IJ. Great masses of a
hard conglomerate of limestone, grit, and shale occur, the cementing material of
which is calcite, evidently deposited from solution by percolating water. Above
this ridge, sandy clay with limestone and chert, as well as grit, gannister, &c.,

may be traced up under the peat to 1,350 feet, and to a somewhat greater altitude
to the westward. Combe Hill (1,454 feet) was not overrun by the ice, its surface

being covered by the angular fragments of the underlying grits, and drift being
also absent from its southern and south-eastern slopes. On Boulsworth Hill, to
the south, drift is found up to nearly 1,400 feet. Thus, though the ice stood up
against these two hills, it did not actually force its way through the gap between
them.

Tr.aced eastwards, the altitude of the margin of the drift diminishes, and it

continues to diminish all down Airedale. It reaches 1,250 feet onKeighley Moor,

and is traceable round into the Worth Valley above Ponden at 960 feet. On

Haworth Moor the limit is met above Leeshaw Reservoir, and south-west of

Leeming, at just above 1,025 feet. No traces of glaciation occur on Oxenhope

Moor and Thornton  Moor  above  Denholme                                            but  the  ice  pushed  round  into  the

Harden Valley, leaving a marginal moraine at Hallas Rough Park (900 feet) con-

sisting of boulder clay, gravel, and sand heaped up in ridges running from N.W.

to S.E. The Harden Valley contains boulder clay as far as Denholme Station.

Clay is also found in the Wilsden Valley and up the face of Harrop Edge to over

925 feet. Drift around Allerton shows that the ice pushed over Chellow Dean

into the Bradford Valley, laying: down thick deposits of tough clay, with many

scratched limestones at Ilorton Grange, and reaching up to the summit of the ridge

separating Airedale and Calderdale at Wibsey Bank Foot. The drift-filled valley

s«en in section near Low Moor Station points to the conclusion that, at the extreme

758 REPORT-- 1900.

phase, a Ic le of ice actually stood over the broad depression in the watershed there,
and smeartd over the low slope a thin cover of boulder clay which entirely obli-

terated the pre-existing minor surface features.

    The presence of drift brings the ice-eilge far up the slope as we follow the
watershed round past Bowling to Laiaterdyke, where the ice laid down in a hollow

in the solid rock, outside the Bradford Valloy, a mass of clay 70 feet in thickness.
The country east of Tyersal is driftless, but the ice passed over the ridge from

Undercliffe to Wrose Hill, boulder clay occurring on the top of Stonehall Hill,

Eccleshill, at an altitude of 700 feet, and also all along the eastern slope of the ridge.

The altitude gradually drops as far as Newlay, where a mass of gravel 30 feet

thick occurs at 200 feet O.D., and 75 feet above the level of the river. All the

pebbles are rounded, and though limestones are numerous, they are small in size,

rarely exceeding four inches in diameter. Tins gravel marks the last definite trace

that we have found in .\iredale of the Airedale ice.
    From similar evidence to tliat which we have adduced in the case of Airedale,

we conclude that there was a glacier in Whavfedale which was confluent with the

Airedale Glacier to the N.W., and also to the S.E. of Rumbles Moor, leaving

only its highest ridge uncovered as a ' nunatak.' The limiting altitude of the ice
on the west is 1,250 feet, sinking gradually to about 1,100 feet on the east. The
configuration of the country, and the presence of a series of drift ridges running
continuously from Wharfedale on the N.W. to Airedale on the S.E., lead us to

believe that the Wharfedale Glacier pushed in as far as Guiseley, the onset of the

Airedale Glacier having been considerably weakened here by its passage over
Hope Hill and the iiigh ground between Hope Hill and Rumbles Moor. The

outermost of these lidges consists largely of gravel containiug limestones, and runs

from Lanshaw Delves, on llkley Moor, to Hawkswortli.

Over the districts of Guiseley, Yeadon, and Horsforth, drift occurs sporadic-

ally, and we have been unable to draw a boundary line between the Airedale and

the Wharfedale ice in this region.

    The striae indicate a general ice-movement from the N.W. Those which we

have observed at higher levels are more strictly parallel to this general direction,

whilst the others more nearly conform with tlie trend ot the particular part of the

Avalley in which they occur.  greater freedom of movement would be expected

in the upper layers of a glacier than in the lower layers, which must mould them-

selves to tJie inequalities of the glacier bed.

     The whole area, within the limits traced out above, displays abundant
evidences of the characteristic remains of a glacier. From Apperley Bridge
upwards the lower portion of the main valley is full of moraine mounds left behind

during the retreat of the ice. The best examples are at Tong Park, near Esholt

Nab Wood, near Saltaire and Bingley.
                                                                                                                                            ;

                                      4. The Extra- Glacial Drainage.

     Every embayment in the unglaciated area-- at the edge of the ice at its

--greatest extension, and during the various phases of retreit would, by receiving

the natural drainage, be converted temporarily into a lake. The level of each
lake would be determined by the height of the ice-barrier and of the watershed
around the margin of the lake. The height of the ice-barrier becomes gradually

lower from N.W. to S.E., and hence we should expect the level of each succeeding

lake at some particular phase to be lower than that of the lake preceding it to
the N.W., so long as the drainage water is confined on that side of the main
watershed proximal to the ice.

    We should therefore expect an overflow of the waters of each lake, by the

lowest point in its margin, into the succeeding lake at the period of greatest exten-
sion of the ice and at every other temporary stationary period during the general

recession.

     The peculiar spur-cutting valleys above mentioned we believe to have been

the overflow-channels of such lakes. Typically, they are flat-bottomed, steep-
sided grooves passing completely through the watershed, characters indicating

rapid cutting by considerable volumes of water. They often end quite suddenly
             TRANSACTtOXS OF SECTION C.                        759

on botli slopes of the watershed through which they are cut, with no approach to

base-levelling to the existing streams. They all slope from the west or north-west

in an easterly or south-easterly direction, Iheir lower terminations being often

marked by level or gently sloping fans of detritus. The altitude of such an

alluvial flat corresponds with that of the head of a similar valley on the next spur

to tlie south-east. The very temporary nature of the surface levels of the lakes,

as attested by the rapidity witii which the gorges were cut, renders the produc-

tion of beaches similar to those observable in Glen Eoy and neighbourhood very

Weunlikely.  have not found any but doubtful examples ; the detection of such

minor features in a country consisting of nearly horizontal beds of hard sandstone

and soft shale must ever be a matter of extreme dilhculty.

   A list was brought forward of over forty overflow-channels with their altitudes,

which mark the successive levels of the surface-waters of the lakes. During the

maximum glaciation there were six lakes on the south side. Those on the north

side were only in existence during retreat.

    The authors desire to thank Mr. P. F. Kendall, F.G.S., for much valuable

advice in connection with the extra-glacial drainage systems.

    6. The Source and Distribution of the far-travelled Boulder's of East

                     Yorkshire. By J. W. Stather, F.G.S.

    A-bout ten years ago Mr. G. W. Lamplugh counted and roughly classified the

larger boulders of Flamborough Head and other selected localities on the York-
shire coast. The work has been continued by the members of the Hull Geological
Society, who have eximined and tabulated upwards of 3,500 boulders of 12 inches
and upwards in diameter (the size-limit adopted by Mr. Lamplugh).

     But besides the larger boulders attention has been paid to the smaller stones
of the drift, which have also yielded results of much interest.

     "With regard to the larger boulders (lists of which have been published in the
reports of the Yorkshire Fioulder Committee and of the British Association
Committee) it has been sought to discover the proportion of rocks from distant
sources, after the elimination of the secondary rocks of local derivation.

     The following table, showing the boulders of two selected localities in the
southern part of the Yorkshire coast and two in the northern part, will serve to

illustrate the general distribution :

navian rocks, which bears out Mr. Marker's suggestion that the tocks not identified
are also from Scandinavia.

     The distribution of the Cheviot porphyrites, which occur principally as stones
and pebbles of smaller dimensions than the boulders of the above table, presents
sonae points of peculiar interest. These, besides increasing in numbers towards
their source, are also more abundant in the upper boulder clays and in the gravels
at the highest levels than in the low-level drift ; vchile, on the other hand, the
Scandinavian rocks, whether as pebbles or boulders, rarely occur at high levels.
This lends support to Mr. Lamplugh's supposition that the North Sea ice-sheet

attained its maximum development and reached farthest inland before the ice

flowing from the north-west of England had reached this portion of the coast, and
that the former flow shrank back as the latter gained strength.

         7. On the Glacial Phenomena of the North-east Corner of the
                 Yorkshire Wolds. By J. W. Stather, F.G.S.

     The rapid thinning away of the Drift inland from the Yorkshire coast has long
been recognised and variously explained. The phenomena along the margin
Avhere it thus thins away on the high ground are worthy of particular attention.

     North-westward from Speeton, where the drift terminates in a chain of morainic
mounds, the top of the chalk escarpment is more or less covered with drift as far

as Hunmanby, where a deep valley, now dry, breaks through the escarpment, and
drains inward to the central valley of the Wolds. Into the valley at Hunmanby

the drift penetrates for a considerable distance, in the form of boulder clay on the

slopes, and gravel containing many foreign stones in the bottom. The boulder
clay thins out long before we reach the main valley, but the gravel with foreign

stones intermixed with local material is present in strong force in the bottom of
the main valley, and it is suggested that a stream draining from the ice has flowed

from Hunmanby along this course. In the higher parts of the main valley, above

Weaverthorpe, foreign material is almost absent, except that near the head of the
yalley, near Luton, there is a patch of drift (shown on the Geological Survey map)
in which are foreign stones, derived chiefly if not wholly from the oolitic rocks,
quite different from the drift in the lower part of the valley.

     North of Hunmanby, at the sharp angle of the Wolds, the boulder clay again
rises to the crest of the escarpment in the form of a thin covering which fades out
gradually westward into a sprinkling of foreign stones in tlie soil. The stones
occur abundantly at an altitude of 400 feet above sea level at High Fordon and
include a large number of Cheviot porphyrites, which here as elsewhere further
north are most abundant at the highest levels, near the margin of the Drift.

     To explain these phenomena it seems necessary to suppose the existence of an

ice-sheet occupying the bed of the North Sea, with its margin only slightly over-
topping the Wolds and not extending far across them. It also appears, as stated

in a preceding paper, that the ice carrying the Cheviot rocks formed the uppermost

portion of the sheet.

8. On the Age of the Raised Beach of Southern Britain as seen in Gower.
        By R. H. TiDDEMAN, M.A., F.G.S., H.M. Geological Survey.

[Cojnmunicated with the permission of the Director-General.]

Gower has a reputation for its caves with their bone-beds, and for its raised

beaches, but to the matter of its Glacial Drifts very little attention has been paid.

Some of the caves were known to and noted by Dean Buckland.* The caves

were long and diligently explored by Colonel Wood of Stout Hall, and the results
Acarefully collated by Dr. Falconer.-
                                       great number of the bones are exhibited in

the Swansea Museum. Mr. Starling Benson, who lived at Swansea, has left an

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  761

account of Bacon Hole, and Dr. Falconer has incidentally alluded to other caves
iu describing the animal remains.

     These three observers noted the fact that the cave fauna, which included
llyana, Ulephas antiquiis, and Rhinoceros hemiiccchua, was found in bone-beds in
the shore caverns and rested on or above a cemented shelly conglomerate, which
was evidently a raised beach, for it formed a floor across the cave at from 10 to
30 feet above the level of the present beach. This conglomerate was found to
contain shells which could not be distiaguished from those of the litoral zone on

the present beach.

     It was recognised that the beach must have been made when the sea was at

that higher level, and that the bones could not have been accumulated until the coast
had been raised above the old beach-level. But the further reasoning, which was
chiefly concerned with the age of the bones, was that, the beach being evidently
rather recent, the bones must be more recent. Falconer did not appear quite con-
tent with this, and called in Prestwich to assist in finding out what relation, if
any, the bone-deposits and raised beach bore to the Glacial deposits.

     Prestwich appears to have worked from the west along the coast to Bacon

Hole, but not to the east. He reported : ' With respect to the point I had particu-
larly in view, viz the relation of the Gower caves to the Boulder Clay, I am as yet

unable to form a decided opinion. I got the Boulder Clay within a mile of the raised
beach, but on opposite sides of the Point of E,hos-sili the subject requires further

--and more lengthened inquiry.' On this Falconer summed up as follows :

     1. That the Gower caves have probably been filled up with mammalian

remains since the deposition of the Boulder Clay.
     2. That there are no mammalian remains found elsewhere in the ossiferous

caves of Britain referable to a fauna of a more ancient geological date.

     It is very singular how near these two eminent men were to making a dis-
covery which they were even looking for. To the east of the rich colony of caves

between Minehin Hole and Bacon Hole, at which they were specially working, the
Drift-beds come on in force, and the succession which they were looking for might
have been very well seen.

     It is true that the proper succession was gradually hammered out by explora-
tions in other places by the Victoria Cave Exploration Committee, by the late
Dr. Hicks in the caves of North Wales, and at a later date by the Rev. C. H.
Pollen, but their researches and the facts evolved by them received a long and
well-sustained fire of hostile criticism which has not long come to an end.

     The survey of Gower has now established, I think I may say, incoutestably :

      1. That the raised beach is Pre- or Interglacial.
      2. That the hone-beds which rest upon it in the caves are continuous with the
earlier ' head ' or debris which lies above it along the coast, and which consists of

limestone fragments.

      3. That Glacial Drift again lies over this.
     4. This in turn is often covered by a later deposit of ' head.'

      Frequently, immediately above the raised beach is a deposit of sand which is
probably blown sand. It contains in places land-snails which are abundant on the
blown sands of Glamorganshire. It is of a foxy-red colour, and its lower part is
often cemented together into calcareous concretions contaiuing little nodules of

manganese and iron. This sand is interesting in this way, that it is seen in many
places where sand could not blow now. The upheaval of the coast implied by the

raised beach would necessarily subject a wide fringe of foreshore to the action of

sun and wind, and the blown sand would result. It is just where we might reason-

ably expect it.

      The section is not always complete. Sometimes the Drift is absent, sometimes
it rests on rock, sometimes one member is absent, sometimes another, but this
represents the succession in which they always occur when present. It is astonish-
ing how very regular they are, considering the steep irregularity of the cliffs and

coasts.
 762 REPORT-- 1900.

     It will of course be suggested that the Drift may have slipped down from the

 cliffs above on to the ' head.' This hypothesis is fairly negatived by the very
 strong contrast in material between the ' head ' and the overlying Drift. The latter
is full of rounded stones of Carboniferous sandstone and Old Red pebbles and frag-
ments, with scarcely a trace of limestone, whilst on the contrary the underlying
debris contains nothing but fragments of limestone. The change is exceedingly
sudden, and forbids the possibility of the Drifts resting on the cliffs for long pre-
viously and later slipping down on to the debris. Scattered boulders would
 certainly have occurred in the d6bris

      The Drift is evidently the ordinary Glacial Drift of Glamorganshire, such as

abounds further to the north-east, nor can we doubt that it is about the same age

as that which sealed up in the Victoria Cave at Settle, and other caves, the fauna
which has been so abundant in the caves of Gower, a fauna which if not Pre-
glacial was certainly Interglacial.

     On the other hand, the discovery of the antiquity of the raised beach, which

does not appear to have been ev?n hinted at, is one which, from the wide range of
that physical feature, must necessarily be of importance. It will assist in building
up the relations of late formations to the Glacial Period into a consecutive system
and establish relations with other successions in lands to which Glacial phenomena
have not extended.

   10. .4 Ferriferous Horizon in the Huronian, North of Lake Stqyerior.

                            By Professor A. P. Coleman.

     The Huronian of Ontario has long attracted attention for its geological interest,
and also because it is much the most important formation in the Province for its
economic products, most of the mines of gold, copper, nickel, and iron occurring
in it. There has, however, been much difficulty in correlating the different areas
mapped as Huronian, and doubts have been expressed as to their being of the
same age. The finding, a year ago, of a band of iron-bearing sandstone and
jasper in the Michipicoton district, north-east of Lake Superior, has thrown fresh
light on the subject. This band has already been traced sixty miles, and very
similar rocks have been proved to exist at various points for a distance of 600
miles, practically from one end of the Province to the other. Not far off from
this band there are very often thick beds of schist conglomerate containing pebbles
of the ferriferous rock, indicating a profound break between upper and lower
Huronian. These two easily recognised horizons occur in practically all the
Huronian areas of Ontario, and afford an excellent clue to the stratigraphy. Their
equivalents are probably found in the Vermilion iron range of Minnesota and the
Markette and Penokee ranges in States to the south of Lake Superior, containing
the most famous iron mines in America. One similar mine has been found at

Michipicoton, estimated to contain at least 15,000,000 tons of high-grade hematite
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and there are indications of other ore deposits on the same range. The recent
discoveries promise, therefore, to be of great economic importance, as well as of
much interest in solving some tangled problems in connection with the oldest
formation in Canada.

         Terminal Curvature.

Near Rhyd-ddu g'lacial striae are to be seen at the following places, to wit

W.near the railway station, at ahoiit 627 feet above the sea, running N. 30°  ; near

Rhos-clogwyn slate quarry, at 900 feet, running N. 50° W. ; and near the path to

Snowdon at 1,200 feet above sea level, running N. 50° W. These strise indicate a

general motion of ice down the valley of the Garfai in which Llyn Owellyn lies.
    On the west side of Llyu-y-Gader (out of which the Garfai flows), not much

above the level of the lake, there is an old slate quarry in ground sloping gently
to the north-east, in which the planes of slaty cleavage, strilsing north-east and

dipping north-west, have their weathered edges bent over towards the north-west.

As this coincides with the direction of ice-flow indicated by the strife mentioned

above, it is but natural to suppose that the bending over was caused by the ice

moving towards the north-west.

But at quarries in the neighbourhood the cleavage planes have not been bent over

they have not been so attected at the llhos-clogwyn quany, near which strife

Cwmwere observed, nor at the    y Llan quarries ; nor at two other old quarries

distant only a hundred yards from that exhibiting the curvature, but on higher

ground.

It is therefore clear that the moving object which bent over the cleavage

planes must have been confined to the very bottom of the valley. The observed
phenomenon could not have been caused by the glacier, whose striiE are to be seen

on the rocks up to at least 1,200 feet above sea level.

                                                                                         Till.

     In some parts of the basin of the river Colwyn a stratified stony clay exists in
which the included stones are all lying flat. In one section this till is seen to
consist of three perfectly distinct divisions. It seems to me to be obviously of a
sedimentary' origin, let down (after the manner suggested by Mr. Goodchild) as a
frozen mass of mud, stones, and ice gradually melted.

                    1. Beach Formation in the Thirlmere Reservoir.

                By R. D, Oldham, Geological Stirvey of India.

     Readers of Mr. Marr's book on the * Scientific Study of Scenery ' will recall the
contrast drawn between the irregular and angular outline of the Thirlmere Lake
reservoir, due to the submergence of a land surface shaped by subaerial denudation,
as contrasted with the more gracefully curved outline of the natural lakes, where
wind, waves, and streams have combined to round ofl'the angulaiities by wearing
away the prominences and filling up the re-entering angles. This reproach seems
to the author to be somewhat exaggerated, as the shore lines of ihe Cumberland
Lakes have only been partially remodelled by wave action and delta formation,
and the original outlines due to simple submergence are still to be seen. However

this may be, the reproach, such as it is, is in process of removal. All along the

shore of the Thirlmere Lake incipient beach erosion is to be seen, and towards the
northern end of the lake, where the shores close in and are exposed to the force of
the waves driven along the length of the lake by the prevailing southerly winds,
typical beaches and beach curves are being developed. Lantern slides showing the
as yet incompleted transition from the irregular outlines produced by submergence

to the reaular curves of beach formation were exhibited and attention drawn to
this interesting opportunity of witnessing the gradual formation and growth of a

beach.

2. The Basal (Carhoniferous) Conglomerate of Ullswater and its Mode of

          Origin. By R. D. OLDnAM, Geological Survey of India.

On the western shore of Ullswater, near its lower end, a good section has

recently been exposed of the basal conglomerates, variously ascribed to Old Red or

lowermost Carboniferous age. This conglomerate has been considered as glacial in

its origin, but does not appear to the author to present any true glacial character-

istics. It contains angular and subangular blocks of all sizes, which are not

scattered indiscriminately, but are arranged with a distinct, though obscure,

banding. In the admixture of blocks of all -sizes and the absence of rounded

boulders, it ditl'ers Irom tbe known river deposits of temperate climes, and more

closely resembles the accumulations of debris which result from cloud-bursts than

and Central Asia, where all rainfall rushes off the bare hills, producing an effect

very like that of a cloud-burst in our own climate, and causing a mixed mass of

water, silt, and s'ones to rush down the river channels, which are dry or carry only

a feeble stream in ordinary times. This mass of material is carried out from the

hills, and forms a deposit with a gently sloping surface extending for miles into

the open country. Carried along in this manner the rock fragments do not

undergo the rounding which they suffer in a more permanent torrent, and are

deposited, on the sudden subsidence of the Hood, in a mixed mass of fragments of

all sizes. The sections exposed along the roadside near the foot of Ullswater not

only exhibit a rude banding, due to the action of successive floods, but also show

patches of current-bedded, fine-grained, gravelly material, representing the action

of the feebler stream which continued after the passage of the dood.

The conclusion drawn is that the conglomerate is a torrential deposit, formed

on dry land, near the foot of a range of hills, in a generally dry climate, varied by

seasonal or periodical bursts of rain. The red colour of the hne-grained material

suggests tropical or sub-tropical conditions, as the formation of red soils is at the

present day much more common in tropical than in temperate regions to such a
degree that it may almost be regarded as characteristic of a hot climate.

4. Sections at the Alexandra Dock Extension, Hidl. By W. H. Crofts.

     These works situated immediately to the east of the Alexandra Dock, and
covering about sevenacres, necessitated the excavation of earth in situ to a depth
of about 20 feet over a great part of this area, the trenches being eight or twelve
feet deeper. The formations exhibited are glacial and post-glacial.

     There is evidence of a basin in chalk corresponding with tiie valley of the river
Hull, the top of the chalk on the east side of the valley being in places higher
than in the bed of the river.

     The glacial deposits reach from the sea on the east up the slope of the Wolds
on the west : these beds are depressed in the neighbourhood of Hull ; this depres-
sion is filled in with warp.

    The Humber warp to the extent of upwards of twelve feet covered the whole

area of the works ; below this over a greater part of this area a peat and clay bed
exists, varying from one inch to three feet in thickness, resting on glacial beds of
a varied character which borings show to be about sixt}^ feet thick, with angular
chalk and flint gravel between them and the solid chalk.

     The deepest part of the wall trenches was about forty feet, but the general
depth was thirty to thirty-four feet below O.U.

     Towards the north the surface of the Boulder Clay rises, a bed of stoneless red
clay intrudes in the upper portion of the gravels, a peat bed makes its appearance,

one of the shell beds disappears, and the toe of a sandy balk is introduced under

the warp. At the north end of this trench there are two beds of Boulder Clay

separated  by gravels, the  red  clay  having  disappeared                                                 otherwise  the  section  is

The shell bed contained Cardium edule, Tellina solidula, Scrobicularia

piperata, Utriculus obtusus, E,issoa ulva, Littorina rudis, L. obtusata, Mytilus

edulis, Pholas Candida, and Nassa incrassata, the latter five being new records

for this bed.

     The large number of very young specimens and both valves being often intact

indicate but a short journey and beach-like conditions.

The surffice of the clay and peat bed was level and undisturbed, except that

the smaller shells of the shell bed above penetrated into numerous crack-like

crevices, and seemed to indicate that the clay had been exposed and sun-dried before

the waters of the estuary formed their shell beach.
     The shell bed underlying the warp and the method of deposition of the warp

appear to suggest that, whether the clay below was deposited under conditions due

to subsidence, suddeu or rapid, or not, a gradual subsidence took place during

the deposition of the warp.

In the clay and peat bed there were stamps of trees, including oak (Quercus

pedunculata), with the roots extending several feet into the glacial beds below

a number of perfect cherries (Prunus Padus) were found, the quantity and con-
dition of wliich may suggest that the trees were bearing fruit at the time of the

first inundation ; a few pieces of charcoal grouped together were also found in this

bed, but careful search revealed nothing that could be attributed to human agency.

   5, The Jurassic Flora of East Yorkshire. By A. C. Seward, F.R.S.

     The plant-beds exposed in the cliff sections of the Yorkshire coast have
afforded unusually rich data towards a restoration of the characteristics and com-
position of a certain faciesof Mesozoic vegetation. Rich collections of plants from
Gristhorpe Bay and other well-known localities are found in the British Museum,
also in the Museums of Scarborough, Whitby, Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester,
York, Newcastle, Leeds, and elsewhere. The Natural History Museum, Paris,
contains several important Yorkshire plants, some of which have been described
by Brongniart and Saporta. The following species have been recognised from the

East Yorkshire area;

                  6. Note on the Age of the Eiiglish Wealden Series.

          By G. "W. Lamplugh, F.G.S., of H.M. Geological Survey.

     In recent discussions arising from the renewed attempts to define more closely
the boundary between the Jurassic and Cretaceous systems in Kussia, Germany,
Belgium, and France, and also in North America, constant reference has been made
to the English "Wealden deposits as afibrding a standard of comparison. But

meanwhile doubt has been thrown, by palaeontologists who have studied certain
portions of the Wealden flora and fauna, on the hitherto accepted classification of
these English deposits with the Lower Ci'etaeeous, on the ground that the fossils

showed strong Jurassic affinities. This opinion has been expressed by the late

Professor O. C. Marsh in regard to the reptiles, by Dr. A. Smith Woodward in
regard to the fish, and by A. C. Seward in regard to the plants. To prevent

further confusion it is therefore desirable that certain facts which have been over-
looked in this discussion, though for the most part already published, should be
restated, since these facts seem sufficient to prove that at any rate the greater
portion of the English Wealden series must remain as part of the Lower Cre-

taceous.

     It has not always been sufficiently borne in mind that the accumulation of the
Wealden Series must have required a period of long duration. The sands of the
Hastings Beds may indeed have been deposited rather rapidly, but the shaly clays
with layers of shells and cyprids interstratified with these sands indicate slower
sedimentation, and the great mass of Weald Clay, reaching 1 ,000 feet in thickness,
must represent an epoch of great length. Hence, since it is universally acknow-

ledged that the fresh-water conditions did not set in until the closing stages
of the Jurassic period, it seems inevitable from this consideration alone that such

conditions persisted into Lower Cretaceous times.
     Again, nearly all the ' Wealden ' fossils in which Jurassic affinities have been

observed have been obtained from the lower part of the Wealden series {i.e. from
the Hastings Beds), and very little is known respecting the corresponding fossils
from the Weald Clay which probably represents the major portion of the Wealden

period.

     Moreover, the argument from the Jurassic affinities of the land and fresh-water

fossils alone inspires no confidence, since if we eliminate the Lower Wealden
fossils from the Lower Cretaceous lists our knowledge is practically limited to
the marine life of this period ; and it may be legitimately asked whether the land
and fresh-water fossils of the Hastings Beds are not, after all, of the character

proper to the lowermost part of the Cretaceous, wherein a close relationship to
the immediately preceding period seems quite appropriate.

     It is from the stratigraphical evidence, however, that the Lower Cretaceous

age of at least the greater portion of the English Wealden Series can be most

satisfactorily established, by its relation to the marine sequence which must form
the ultimate basis of the classification. The marine beds directly overlyino- the
Weald Clay in the south of England represent only the latest stage (Aptien)
of the Lower Cretaceous period
                                                                                                                                                                                ;  and although  there  is a  sharp line  of demarca-

tion at their base, this seems to denote a rapid change of conditions and not a
lengthy tune-interval, since the incoming of marine or brackish-water shells near
the top of the Wealden strata in Dorset, Hampshire, and Surrey, foreshadowino-

the termination of the fresh-water episode, indicates that the series is practically
complete, and has undergone little if any erosion in these parts before the deposition

of the overlying marine strata. Such erosion may, however, have taken place
locally towards the easterly and westerly terminations of the basin of deposition
where the topmost beds of the Wealden Series are not found.                                                                                                                                                                            '

    In the Speeton Clay, where the Lower Cretaceous marine sequence is fullv

represented, the equivalents of the Lower Greensand and Atherfield Clay of the
south of England are comprised within a relatively narrow compass in the
sparingly fossiliferous upper part of the sequence ; » and therefore by far the o-reater
portion of the Lower Cretaceous period, if represented at all in the south of
England, must be represented in the Wealden Series. The portion of the Speeton
Clay unrepresented by marine sediments in the south includes the lower part of
the Zone of Belemnites brunsvicensis, and the whole of the Zone of Bel. jaculum
both undoubtedly Lower Cretaceous (Barremteti, Hauterivieii, and Valcmginien)
together with the whole of the Zone of Bel. lateralis, the fauna of which shows
J urassic affinities. Furthermore, in tracing this marine series southward from York-
shire through Lincolnshire into Norfolk, the author has found that in the latter
county the lower zones are apparently absent, and the remainino- portion represent-
ing probably the lower part of the Zone of Bel. brunsvicensis^ia chara'ctensed by

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.

The President delivered the following Address :

myIn opening to-day the sittings of the Zoological Section, I must first express

sense of the honour which has been conferred on me in having heen chosen as

your President on this occasion, and I may add that I feel it not only as an

honour to myself personally hut also as a compliment to the field of investigation

in which the greater part of my own original work has heen done.- It is a wel-

come recognition of the doctrine, which I, and much more important men indeed

than T, have always maintained, namely, that Palaeontology, however valuable,

nay, indispensable, its bearings on Geology may be, is in its own essence a part of

Biology, and that its facts and its teachings must not be overlooked by those who

would pursue the study of Organic Morphology on a truly comiirehensive and

scientific basis. As I have asked on a previous occasion, ' Does an animal cease

to be an animal because it is preserved in stone instead of spirits ? Is a skeleton

any the less a skeleton because it has been excavated from the rock, instead of

prepared in a macerating trough ? ' And I may now add--Do animals, because

they have been extinct for it may be millions of years, thereby give up their place

in the great chain of organic being, or do they cease to be of any importance to

the evolutionist because their soft tissues, now no longer existing, cannot be

imbedded in paraffine and cut with a Cambridge microtome ?

These are thesss which I think no  one  denies  theoretically                                                             but  what  of  the

must ask them not to be offended if I say that in times past I have a few things

against some of them at least. I refer first to the apathy concerning palfeonto-

logical work, more especially where fishes are concerned, which one frequently

meets with in the writings of biologists, as seen in the setting up of classifications

and theories and the erection of genealogical trees without any, or with at least

inadequate, enquiry as to whether such theories or trees are con'oborated by the

record of the rocks. But more vexatious still are the off'hand proceedings of some

biologists who, when they wish to complete their generalisations on the structure

of a living organism, or group of organisms, by allusion to those which in geological

time have gone before, do not take the trouble to consult the original palseonto-

logical memoirs or papers, or to make themselves in an}' way practically

acquainted with the subject, but derive their knowledsje at second or third hand

from some text-book or similar work, which may not in every case be exactly up

to date on the matters in question. Nay, more than this, I think I have seen the

authors of such text-books or treatises credited with facts and illustrations which

were due to the labours of hard-working palaeontologists years before.

But a bettef time, I am convinced, is not far oiF, when the unity of all biological

science will be recognised not merely theoretically but also practically by workers

in every one of its branches.

Of one thing I must however warn those who have hitherto devoted their

time exclusively to the investigation of things recent, namely, that a special

training is necessary for the correct interpretation of fossil remains, especially

those of the lower Vertebrata and many groups of Invertebrata. So it comes that

what looks to the uninitiated eye a mere confused mass of broken bones or plates

may to the trained observer aftbrd a flood of valuable light on questions of struc-

Weture previously undetermined.  must take into account the condition of the

fossil as regards mineralisation and crushing ; we must learn to recognise how

the various bones may be dislocated, scattered, or shoved over each other, and to

Wedistinguish true sutures from mere fractures.  must carefully correlate the

positive results obtained from one specimen with those afforded by others, and in

this way it happens that to make a successful restoration of the exo- or endo-
skeleton of a fossil fish or reptile may require years of patient research. But the

thought sometimes does come up in my mind, that some people imagine that

fossils, such as fishes, occur in the rocks all restored and ready, so that the author

of such a restoration has no more scientific credit in his work than if he were an

ordinary draughtsman drawing a perch or a trout for an illustrated book ! But
the student of fossil remiiins must learn not only to see what does exist in the

--specimen he examines, but also to refrain from seeing things which are not there
   to know what he does not see as well as what he does see. For many grave

errors have arisen from want of this necessary training, as for instance where

the under surface of a fish's head has been described as the upper, or where

markings of a purely pptrological character have been supposed to indicate actual

structures of the greatest morphological importance. Or we may find the most
wonderful details described, which may indeed have existed, but for which the

actual evidence is onl}'^ the fertile imagination of the writer.

From this it will be apparent that though Palfeontology is Biology and

Biology includes Paloeontology, yet as regards original research a division of

labour is in most cases necessary. For though palseontological investigations are

absolutely impossible without an adequate knowledge of recent zoology, yet the

nature of the remains with which the palfeontologi.st has to deal renders their

interpretation a task of so different a character from that allotted to the investiga-

tion of the structure and development of recent forms that he will scarcely have

time for the successful carrying out of a second line of research. Conversely, the

same holds regarding the sphere of work of the recent biologist.

    Now those last remarks of mine may perhaps tend to confirm an idea which I

have at least been told is prevalent in the minds of recent biologists, nameh',

that the results of Paleontology are so uncertain, so doubtful, and so imperfect,

that they are scarcely worthy of serious attention being paid to them. And the

best answer I can make to such an opinion, if it really does exist, is to try to

place before you some evidence that Palfeontology is not- mere (ossil shell hunting,

or the making up of long lists of names to help the geologists to settle their

stratigraphical horizons, but may present us with abundance of matter of genuine

biological interest.

     Since the days of Darwin, there is one subject which more' than all others
engrosses the attention of scientific biologists. I mean the question of Evolution,

or the Doctrine of Descent. Time was when controversies raged round the very
idea of Evolution, and when men of science were divided among themselves as to

whether the doctrine to which Darwin's theory of Natural Selection gave so
mighty an impetus was or was not to be accepted. Times have however changed,

and I hardly think that we should now find a single true scientific worker who

continues to hold on by the old special creation idea. Philosophic zoologists now

busy themselves either with amassing morphological evidences of Descent or with

the discussion of various theories as to the factors by which organic evolution has

--been brought about whether Natural Selection has been the all-sufficient cause or

not, whether acquired peculiarities are transmissible, and so on.

1900.                                                             3D
770 REPORT--1900.

    From the natui'e of things it is clear that the voice of the palaeontologist can

only be heard on the morpholngical aspect of the question, but to many of us,
including myself, the morphological argument is so convincing that we believe

that even if the Darwinian theory were proved to-morrow to be utterly baseless,
the Doctrine of Descent would not be in the sligbtest degree affected, but would

continue to have as firm a hold on our minds as before.

    Now as Palaeontology takes us back, far back, into the life of the past, it

might bo reasonably expected that it would throw great light on the descent of
animals, but the amount of its evidence is necessarily much diminished by two

imfortunate circumstances. First, the terrible imperfection of the geological

record, a fact so obvious to any one having any acquaintance with Geology that
it need not be discussed here ; and secondly, the circumstance that save in very

exceptional cases only the hard parts of animals ai-e preserved, and those too oftep

in an extremely fragmentary and disjointed condition. But though we cannot

expect that the palseontological record will ever be anything more than fragmen-
tary, yet the constant occurrence of new and important discoveries leads us to
entertain the hope that, in course of time, more and more of its pages will become

disclosed to us.

     Incomplete, however, as our knowledge of Evolution as derived from

PahBontology must be, that is no reason why we should not appraise it at its
proper value, and now and again stop for a moment to take stock of the material

which has accumulated.

    You are all already acquainted with the telling evidence in favour of Evolution
furnished by the well-known series of Mammalian limbs, as well as of teeth, in

which the progress, in the course of time, from the more general to the n.ore

special is so obvious that I cannot conceive of any unprejudiced person shutting

his eyes to the inference that Descent with modification is the reason of these

things being so. Suppose, then, that on this occasion we take up the palseonto-

logical evidence of Descent in the case of fishes. This I do the more readily
because what original work I have been able to do has lain principally in the

direction of fossil ichthyology ; and again, because it does seem to me that it is in

this department thnt one has most reason to complain of want of interest on the

part of recent biologists, even, I may say, of some professed palaeontologists

themselves.

     But the subject is really of so great an extent that to exhaust it in the course
of an address like the present would be simply impossible, so I shall in the main

limit myself to the consideration of Palaeozoic forms, and this more especially see-

ing that we may hope for a large addition to our light on the fishes of the more

recent geological formations from the fourth volume of the ' Catalogue of Fossil

Fishes ' in the British Museum, which will soon appear from the pen of my friend

Dr. A. Smith Woodward. I need scarcely say how much his previous volume has

conduced to a better knowledge of the Mesozoic forms.

    Here I may begin by boldly affirming that I include the Mar.sipobranchii as

fishes, in spite of the dictum of Cope that no animal can be a fish which does not

possess a lower jaw and a shoulder-girdle. "NVhy not? The position seems to me

to  be  a  merely  arbitrary  one                     and it  is, to  say the  least, not  impossible  that  the
                                                   ;

modern Lampreys and Hags may be, as many believe, the degenerate descendants

of originally gnathostomatous forms.

     To the origin of the Vertebrata Palajontology gives us no clue, as the fore-
runners of the fishes must have been creatures which, like the lowest Chordata of
the present day (Qrochorda, Hemichorda, Cephalochorda), had no hard parts capable
of preservation. And though I shall presently refer again to the subject,! may

here affirm that, so far as I can read the record at least, it is impossible to derive

from Palaeontology any support to the view, recently revived, that the ancient

fishes are in any way related to Crustacean or Merostomatous ancestors.

     What have we then to say concerning the most ancient fishes Vkith which we

are acquainted ?

     The idea that the minute bodies, known as Conodonts, which occur from the
Cambrian to the Carboniferous, are the teeth of fishes ai:d possibly even of ancient
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                               771

Marsipobranclis may now be said to be given up. They are now accepted by the

most reliable authorities as appertaining to Invertebrata such as Aunelides and

Gephyrea.

More recently, however, Rohon * has described from the Lower Silurian of the

neijjhbourhood of St. Petersburg small teeth {Palaiodus and ArcJiodus) associated

·with Conodonts, and which seem to be real fish teeth, but not of Selachians, as is

shown by the presence of a pulp cavity surrounded by non-vascular dentine. It is

impossible to say anything more of their affinities.

Obscure and fragmentary fish remains have been obtained by Walcot, and

described by Jaekel, from rocks in Colorado supposed to be of Lower Silurian or

Ordovician age.'- But doubts have been thrown on their age, and the fossils them-

selves, -which have, it must be owned, a very Devonian look about them, are

so extremely fragmentary that they do not help us much in our present purpose.

    It is not till we come to the Upper Silurian rocks that we begin to feel the
ground securely under our feet, though we may be certain, from the degree of
specialisation of the forms which we there find, that fishes lived in the waters of the

globe for long ages previously.

Characteristic of the ' Ludlow bone-bed ' are certain minute scales on which

Pander founded the family Ccelolepidaj, having a flat or sculptured crown, below

which is a constricted ' neck,' and then a base usually perforated by an aperture

leading into a central pulp cavity. As these little bodies, looked upon by Agassiz
as teeth, were .shown by McCoy to be scales, and as they occurred at Ludlow in

England and Oesel in Russia along with small Selachian spines {0?ickus), they were

usually considered as appertaining, with the latter, to small Cestraciont sharks.

The genera Thelofhis, Ccalole^nK, and others were founded on these dermal bodies,

but it is doubtful if any but the first of these names will stand.

But the aspect of affairs was altogether changed by the discovery three years

ago by the officers of the Geological Survey of "entire specimens of Thelodus in

the Upper Silurian rocks of the South of Scotland, from which it was evident that

the fish, though somewhat shark-like, could hardly be reckoned as a true Selachian.^

Thelodus scoticiis, Traq., has a broad flattened anterior part correspondinn- to the

head and forepart of the body, very bluntly rounded in front, and passino- behind

into right and left angular flap-like projections, which are sharply marked olf from

the narrow tail, which is furnished with a deeply cleft heterocercal caudal fin.

Unless the flap-like lateral projections are representatives of pectorals, no other

fins are present, neither do we find any teeth or jaws, nor any trace of internal

skeleton ; and it is only a few days since Mr. Tait, collector to the Geological

Survey of Scotland, pointed out to me in a recently acquired specimen a right and

left dark spot at the outer margins of the head near the front, which spots may
Aindicate the position of the eyes.*

also occurred, in which the creature had the very same form, but instead of havinf

the skin clothed with small shagreen-like scales, possessed, in their place, minute

sharp conical hollow spines, without base and open below. What we are to think

of those two ancient forms, apparently so primitive, and yet undoubtedly also to a

gi'eat extent specialised, we shall presently discuss.

Let us now for a moment look at the genus Drepanaspis, Scbliiter, from the

WeLower Devonian of Gmiinden in Western Germany.*     have here a strange

creature whose shape entirely reminds us of that of TheloduSj having the same flat

broad anterior part, bluntly rounded in front, and angulated behind, to which is

appended a narrow tail ending in a heterocercal caudal fin, which is, however,
scarcely bilobate. But here the dermal covering, instead of consisting of separate
scales or spinelets, shows a close carapace of hard bony plates, of which two are

-- --especially large and prominent the median dorsal and the median ventral other

large ones being placed around the margins, while the intervening space is occupied
by a mosaic of small polygonal pieces. The position of the mouth, a transverse
slit, is seen just at the anterior margin ; it is bounded behind by a median mental
or chin-plate, but no jaws properly so called are visible, nor are there any teeth.

Then on each margin near the front of the head is a small round pit, exactly in the

position of the darli spot seen in some examples of Thelodus, which, if not an orbit,

must indicate the position of some organ of sense. Again, the tail is covered with
scales after the manner of a 'ganoid ' fish, being rhombic on the sides, but assum-
ing the form of long deeply imbricating fulcra on the dorsal and ventral margins.

The position of the branchial opening, or openings, has not yet been definitely

ascertained.

    All these plates are closely covered with stellate tubercles, and we cannot

escape from the conclusion that they are formed by the fusion of small shagreen

bodies lilce those of Thelodus, and united to bony matter developed in a deeper

layer of the skin.

    If the angular lateral flaps of Thelodus represent pectoral fins, then we should

have the exceedingly strange phenomenon of such structures becoming functionally

useless by enclosure in hard unyielding plates, though still influencing the general

outline of the fish. Be that as it may, can we doubt that in Drepanaspis we have

a form derived by specialisation from a Crelolepid ancestor ?

     This Drepianaspis throws likewise a much-desired light on the fragmentary

Devonian remains known since Agassiz's time as Psammosteus. These consist of

large plates and fragments of plates, composed of vaso-dentine, and sculptured

externally by minute closely set stellate tubercles, exactly resembling the scales of

some species of Thelodus. These tubercles are also frequently arranged in small

polygonal areas, reminding us exactly of the small polygonal plates of Drepanaspis,

and, like them, often having a specially large tubercle in the centre. That Psam-

mosteus had an ancestry similar to that of Drepanaspis can also hardly be

doubted.

     Finally, in the well-known Pteraspis of the Upper Silurian and Lower Devonian
formations we have a creature which also has the head and anterior part of the

body enveloped in a carapace, to which a tail covered with rhombic scales is

appended behind, and, though the caudal fin has never been properly seen, such
remains of it as have occurred distinctly indicate that it was heterocercal in its
contour. The plates of the carapace have a striking resemblance in general

arrangement to those of Drepanaspis, though the small polygonal pieces have

disappeared, and there is a prominent pointed rostrum in front of the  mouth                              and
                                                                                                       ;

it is to be noted that the small round apertures usually supposed to be orbits are

in a position quite analogous to that of the sensory pits in Drepanaspis. The

plates of the carapace of Pteraspis are not, however, tuberculated, but orna-
mented by fine close parallel ridges, the microscopic structure of which, along with
their frequent lateral crenulation, leaves no doubt in our minds that they have

been formed by the running together in lines of TIielodus-\\k& shagreen grains.

An aperture supposed to be branchial is seen on the plate forming the posterior

angle of the carapace on each side.

Until these recent discoveries concerning the Coelolepidse and Drepanaspidte,

Pteraspis and its allies, Cyathaspis and Palceaspis, constituted the only family

included in the order Heterostraci of the sub-class Ostracodermi, distinguished, as

shown by Lankester, by the absence of bone lacunte in the microscopic structure

of their plates. It is now, however, clear that we can trace them back to an

ancestral family in which the external dermal armature was still iu the generalised
form of separate shagreen grains or spinelets.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  773

     But the Ostracodermi are usually made to include two other groups or orders,
namely the Osteostraci and the Asterolepida.'

     The Osteostraci are distinguished from the Heterostraci by the possession of
lacuna) in their bone structure, and by having the eyes in the middle of the head-
shield instead of at the sides. Cephalaspis, which occurs from the Upper Silurian
to the top of the Devonian, is the best known representative of this division. In-
stead of a carapace, we find a large head-shield of one piece, though its structure
shows evidence of its having been originally composed of a mosaic of small poly-
gonal plates, and it is also to be noted that the surface is ornamented by small

tubercles, there frequently being one larger in size in the centre of each polygonal

area. The posterior-external angles of the shield project backwards in a right and

left pointed process or cornu, scarcely developed in C. Murchisoni, internal to
which, and also organically connected with the head-shield, is a rounded flap-
like structure, which strougly reminds us of the lateral flaps of the CoelolepidEe.

The body is covered with scales, which on the sides are high and narrow;
there is a small dorsal fin, and the caudal, though heterocercal, is not bilobate.

It is scarcely necessary for me to add that we find just as little evidence of jaws

or of teeth as in the case of the Heterostraci.

     The association of the Pleterostraci and Osteostraci in one sub-class of Ostra-
codermi has been strongly protested against by Professor Lankester and Dr. 0. M.
Reis, but here the Scottish Silurian strata come to the rescue with a form which I
described last year under the name of Ateleaspis tessellata, and of which some more

perfect examples than those at my disposal at that time have recently come to

light through the labours of Mr. Tait, of the Geological Survey of Scotland.

    Here we have a creature whose general form reminds us strongly of T/ielodus,

but whose close affinity to Cephalaspis is absolutely plain, were it only on account

of the indications of orbits on the top of the head.

     The expanded anterior part which here represents the head-shield of Cepha-
laspis shows not the slightest trace of cornua, but forms posteriorly a gently
rounded lobe on each side, clearly suggesting that the cornual flaps of
Cephalaspis are homologous with and derivable from the lateral expanses in the
Coelolepidae. This cephalic covering is composed of numerous small polygonal
plates like those of which the head-shield in Cephalaspis no doubt originally con-
sisted, and the minute tubercles which cover their outer surfaces also suggest that
the superficial layer was formed by the fusion of Ccelolepid scales. The body is
covered with rhombic scales, sculptured externally with tubercles and wavy trans-
verse ridges, and arranged in lines having the same general direction as the scutes
of Cephalaspis, from which we may infer that the latter originated from the fusion
of scales of similar form. The fins are as in Cephalaspis, there hemg one small
dorsal situated far back, and a heterocercal caudal, which is triangular in shape, and
not deeply cleft into upper and lower lobes as in the Coelolepidse. Finally, the
pcales, on microscopic examination, show well-developed bone lacunae in their

internal structure.

     That Ateleaspis belongs to the Osteostraci there is thus not the smallest doubt,

but its general resemblance to the Coelolepidas in its contour anteriorly led me

to regard it as an annectent form, and consequently to believe that there is after
all a genuine genetic connection between the Heterostraci and the Osteostraci.

And I have not seen reason to depart from that opinion even though Ateleaspis

turns out to be still closer to Cephalaspis than was apparent in the original

specimens.

     If this be so, then Cephalaspis, as well as Pteraspis and its allies, is traceable

to the Ccelolepida), shark-like creatures in which, as we have already seen, the

dermal covering consists of small shagreen-like scales, or of minute hollow spines,
and consequently all theories as to the arthropod origin of the Ostracodermi, so
far as they are founded on the external configuration of the carapace in the more

     ' To these I myself recently added a fourth, the Anaspida, for the remarkable

specialised forms, must fall to the ground. And from the close resemblance of these

--scales of Thelodus to Elasmobranch shagreen bodies for forty-five years they had
--been, by most authors, actually referred to the Selachii I concluded that the

 Ccelolepidse owed their origin to some form of primitive Elasmobranchs. That
is, however, not in accordance with the view of the late Professor Cope, that the
Ostracodermi are more related to the Marsipobranchii, and that, from the apparent
absence of lower jaw, they should be placed along with the last-named group in a class

of Agnatha, altogether apart from the fishes proper. And Dr. Smith Woodward,
who is inclined to favour Cope's theory, has expressed his view that the similarity

of the Coelolepid scales to Elasmobranch shagreen is no proof of an Elasmobranch
derivation, but that such structures, representing the simplest form of dermal hard

parts, may have originated independently in far distant groups.^ Knowing what
we do of the occurrence of strange parallelisms in evolution, it would not bo safe

to deny such a possibility. But as to a Marsipobranch affinity, I would point out
that the apparent want of lower jaw among the hard parts which nature has pre-
served for us is no proof of the absence of a Meckelian cartilage among the soft parts
which are lost to us for ever ; and also, as Professor Lankester has remarked, that
there is no evidence whatever that any of the creatures classed together as Ostraco-
dermi were monorhinal like the Lampreys. The only fossil vertebrate having a
·single median opening, presumably nasal, in the front of the head is Pcdaio-
spondylus, but, whatever be the true affinities of this little creature, at present the

subject of so much dispute, I think we may be very sure that it is not an

Ostracoderm.
     The Devonian ' Antiarcha ' or Asterolepida, of which Pterichthi/s is the best

known genus, are also usually placed in the Ostracodermi, with which they agree
in the possession of a carapace of bony plates, in the absence of distinct lower jaw

or teeth, in the non-preservation of internal skeleton, and in having a scaly tail
furnished with a heterocercal caudal fin, and, as in the Cephalaspidae, also with a
small dorsal. But they have in addition a pair of singular jointed thoracic limbs,
evidently organs of progression, which are totally unlike anything in the Osteostraci
or in the Heterostraci, or indeed in any other group of fishes. These limbs are
covered with bony plates and hollow inside; but though I once fancifully compared
them in that respect with the limbs of insects, I must protest strongly against this
expression of mine being quoted in favour of the arthropod theory of the deriva-
tion of the Vertebrata

     'N'or do I think that there is any probability in the view published by Simroth
nine years ago," namely, that Pterichthys may have been a land animal which used
its limbs for progression on dry ground, and that the origin of the heterocercal tail
was the bending up of the extremity of the vertebral axis caused by its being
dragged behind the creature in the act of walking. That view was promulgated
before the discovery of the membranous expanse of the caudal fin in this

genus.

     But though the Asterolepida are apparently related to and inclusible in the
Ostracodermi, the geological record is silent as to their immediate origin, no inter-
mediate forms having been found connecting them more closely with either the
Heterostraci or the Osteostraci. In the possession of bone lacunjs and of a dorsal
fin they have a greater resemblance to the latter, but it may be looked upon as
certain that they could have had no direct origin from that group.

     As regards the Ostracodermi as a sub-class, they become extinct at the end of

the Devonian epoch, and cannot be credited with any share in the evolution of the

fishes of more recent periods, not even if we restore the Coccosteans or Arthrodira
to their fellowship. To the latter most enigmatical group, which I shall still
continue to look upou as fishes, I shall make some reference further on.

     Coming now to say a word regarding the Elasmobranchii, it is plain from the
fin-spines found in Upper Silurian rocks that they are of very ancient origin, and
that if we only knew them properly they would have a wonderful tale of evolution

to tell. But their internal skeleton is from its nature not calculated for preserva-
tion, and for the most part we only Icuow those creatures from scattered teeth,
fin-spines, aud shagreen, specimens showiu<? either external configuiation or

internal structure beiDjr rare, especially in Palseozoic strata. But from what we do

know, there is no doubt that the ancient sharks were less specialised than those of
the present day. and that the recent Notidauids still preserve peculiarities which

were common in the Selachii of past ages.
    If we ask whether the fossil sharks throw any light on the disputed origin of

the paired limbs, whether from the specialisation of right and left lateral folds, or

whether that type of limb called ' archipterygium ' by Gegenbaur, consisting of
a central jointed axis with pre- and post-axial radial cartilage attached, was the

original form, I fear we get no very definite answer from Elasmobranch palteon-
tology. The paired lins of the Upper Devonian shark, Cladoselache, as described
by Bashford Dean, Smith Woodward, and others, seem to favour the lateral fold

theory, and Cope pointed to the right and left series of small intermediate spines
which in some Lower Devonian Acauthodei {Fare.nis and Climatius) extend

between the pectorals and veutrals as evidence of a former continuuas lat- ral

fin. So also, if 1 am right in looking on the lateral Haps of the Coelolepid;X)

as fins, the evidence ol the^e ancient Ostracodermi would be in the same

direction.

    But, on the other hand, we have the remarkable group of Pleuracanthidaj,
extending from the Lower Permian back to the Upper Devonian, in which the
paired tins are represented by an 'archipterygium ' which in the pectoral at least

is biserial.

    From this biserial 'archipterygium' in the Pleuracanthidse, Professor A.
Fritsch, ten years ago,' derived the tribasal arrangement of modern sharks, much

according to the Gegenbaurian method, effecting, however, a compromise with the
lateral fold theory by assuming that the Pleuracanth form originated from one,

consisting of simple parallel rods, like that described in Cladoselache.

    myIn description of the pectoral fin of the Carboniferous Cladodus Neilsotii-

I have shown that the cartilaginous structures apparently present a uniserial
archipterygium intermediate between the arrangement in Fleuvacanthus and that in
the modern sharks, but I felt compelled to acknowledge that the specimen might
also be interpreted in exactly the opposite way, namely, as an example of a transi-
tion from the ' ptychopterygium ' of Cladosdache to the Pleuracanth and Dipnoan

limb. And so in fact this tin of Cladodus is claimed in support of their views by

both parties in the dispute.

When we add that Semon emphatically denies that there is any proof for

considering that the pectoral fin of Cladoselache is primitive in its type,^ and that

Campbell Brown, in his recent paper on the Mesozoic genus Hi/boclus* supports

Gegenbaur's theory, it will be seen that Elasmobranch palfcontology has not as

yet uttered any very clear or decided voice on the question as to whether the so-

called archipterygium is the primary form of paired fin in the fish, or only a

Wesecondary modification.     shall now inquire if we can obtain any more light

on the subject from the Crossopterygii and Dipnoi.
     The Crossopterygii are a group of Teleostomous fishes, characterised externally

by their jugular plates and lobate paired fins, and represented in the present day
only by the African genera Tolyptevus and Calamoichthys, which together form

the peculiar family Polypteridie. The Crossopterygii appear suddenly in the
middle of the Devonian period, their previous ancestry being unknown to us.

dontidse, Holoptycliiidse, and Ccelacanthidae, but it is only with the first three that

we have at present to deal. The Osteolepida3 and Khizodontidae, which appear

together in Middle, and die out together in Upper Palaeozoic times, resemble each

other very closel}'. In both we have the paired fins, more especially the pectoral,

obtusely or subacntely lobate : there are two separate dorsal tins, one anal, and the

other caudal, which is usually heterocercal, though in some geaiera it is more or less

diphycercal. lu both the teeth are conical and have the same complex structure,

the dentine being towards the base thrown into vertical labyrintbic folds, exactly

as in the Stegocephalian Labyrinthodonts, and this along with the lung-like

development of the double air-bladder in the recent Polypteridsc has given rise to

the view that from these forms the Stegocephalia have oi'iginated. The nasal

openings must have been on the under surface of the snout, as in the Dipnoi.

Of these two so closely allied families we must conclude that the Osteolepidae

are the more primitive, as in them the scales are acutely rhombic and usually

covered with a thick layer of ganoine, while in the Rhizodontidse they are rounded,

deeply imbricating, and normally devoid of the ganoine layer, which, however,

occasionally recurs on the scales of H/nzodopsis and the fin-rays of Gyroptychius.

    What then of the structure of the paired fins ? Fortunately in the lihizodont

genera Tristichojiterus and Eusthenopteron the internal skeleton of the lobe was

ossified, and what we see clearly exhibited in the pectoral of some specimens is

Westriking enough.                                                                                                         have a basal piece attached to the shoulder-girdle and

followed by a median axis of four ossicles placed end to end. The first of these

shows on its postaxial margin a strong projecting process, while to its preaxial

side, close to its distal extremity, a small radial piece is obliquely articulated, and a

similar one is joined also to the second and third segments of the axis. The

arrangement in the ventral fin is essentially similar.

In fact we have in the Rhizodontidfe a short uniserial 'archipterygium,' and

the question is, Has this been formed by the shortening up and degeneration of an

originally elongated and biserial one, or on the other hand do we find here a

condition in which the stage last referred to has not yet been attained ? This

question is inseparable fj-om the next, whether the Ehizodonts or the Holopty-

chians form the most advanced type.

The Holoptychiidae resemble the Rhizodontidse extremely closely in their external

head-bones, in their rounded, deeply imbricating scales, and in the form and arrange-

ment of their median fins. But the teeth show a more complex and specialised

structure than those of the Rhizodontidse                                                                                                                                                        the simple vertical vascular tubes formed
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

by the repeated folding of the dentine in that family being connected by lateral

branches around which the dentine tubules are grouped in such a way as to give rise

in transverse sections to a radiating arborescent appearance; hence the term ' den-

drodont.' In this respect, then, the Holoptychiidse show an advance on the Rhizo-

--dontidse what then of the paired fins.^ While the ventral remains subacutely lobate,

as in the previous family, the pectoral has now assumed an elongated acutely lobate

shape, with the fin-rays arranged along the two sides of a central scaly axis exactly

as in the Dipnoi ; and though the internal skeleton has not yet been seen, yet,

judging by analogy, we cannot escape the belief that it was in the form of a

complete biserial ' archipterygium.'

What, then, ia the condition of affairs in the oldest known Dipnoan ?
The oldest member of this group with whose configuration we are acquainted is

I)ipterus,vfh.\ch. likewise appears in the middle of the Devonian period simultaneously

with the Osteolepidas, Rhizodontidse, and Holoptychiidse. In external form it

closely resembles a Holoptychian, having a heterocercal caudal fin, two similarly

placed dorsals, one anal, and cii'cular imbricating scales, which, however,

have the exposed part covered with smooth ganoine. But now we have the

ventrals as well as the pectorals acutely lobate in shape, and presumably archi-

pterygial in structure                                                                                                     the top of the head is covered with many small plates, there
                                                                                                                        ;

is no longer a dentigerous maxilla, the skull is autostylic, and the palatopterygoids

and the mandibular splenial are like those of Ceratodus and bear each a tooth-plate

with radiating ridges.

Now, comparing Dipterus with the recent Ceratodus and Frotopterus, the first
                                                                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                             777

conclusion we are likely to draw is, that the older Dipnoan is a very specialised

form, that its heterocercal tail and separate dorsals and anal are due to specialisa-

tion from the continuous diphycercal dorso-ann-caudal arrangement iu the recent

forms, that the Holoptychiidaj were developed from it by shortening up of the

ventral archipterygium, as well as by the changes in cranial structure, and that

the Rhizodontidae and Osteolepidoe are a still more specialised series iu -which tlie

pectoral archipterygium has also shared the fate of the ventral in becoming

shortened up and uniserial.

    Five years ago, however, M. Dollo, of the Natural History Museum at

Brussels, the well-known describer of the fossil reptiles of Bernissart, proposed a

new view to the effect that the process of evolution had gone exactly in the

opposite direction ; ^ and after long consideration of the subject I find it difficult to

escape from the conclusion that this view is more in accordance with the facts of

the case, though, as we shall see, it also has its own difficulties.

I have already indicated above that we are, on account of the more specialised

structure of the teeth, justified in considering the Holoptychians, with their

acutely lobate pectorals, a newer type than the Ehizodonts, even though they did

Wenot survive so long in geological time. What, then, of the question of autostyly ?

          do not know the suspensorium of HolopUjchius, but that of the Rhizodontidse

Nowwas certainly hyostylic, as in the recent Pohjpterus.                                                 as there can be no doubt

that the autostylic condition of skull is a specialisation on the hyostylic form, as seen

also in the Chimseroids and in the Amphibia, to suppose that the hyostylic

Crossopterygii were evolved from the autostylic Dipnoi is, to say the least, highly

myimprobable in                                                         own opinion, as well as in that of M. Dollo', it will not stand.
                                                      ;

And if we assume a genetic connection between the two groups it is in accordance

with all analogy to look on the Dipnoi as the children and not as the parents of

the Crossopterygii.

_ M. Dollo adopts the opinion of Messrs. Balfour and Parker that the apparently

primitive diphycercal form of tail of the recent Dipnoi is secondary, and caused

by the abortion of the termination of the vertebral axis as in various ' Teleostei,'

60 that no argument can be based on the supposition that it represents the original

' protocercal                                                           or preheterocercal stage.  Very likely that is so, but it is not of so
                                                                     '

much importance for the present inquiry, as both in the Osteolepidae and Rhizodon -

tidae we find among otherwise closely allied genera some which are heterocercal,

others more or less diphycercal. Biplopterus, for example, differs from Thursius

only by its diphycercal tail, and in like manner among the Rhizodontidffi Tristi-

chopterus is heterocercal, Eusthenoptero7i is nearly diphycercal, and there can be no

doubt that, in spite of this, their caudal fins are perfectly homologous structures.

But of special interest is the question of the primitive or non-primitive nature

of the continuity of the median fins in the recent Dipnoi. Like others I was

inclined to believe it primitive, and that the broken-up condition of these fins in
Dipterus was a subsequent specialisation, and in fact gave the series Phayieropleuron

Scaumenacia, Diptenis macroptenis, and D. Valenciennesii as illustrating this

process of differentiation.- This view of course draws on the imperfection of the

geological record in assuming the existence of ancient pre-Dipterian Dipnoi with
continuous median fins, which have never yet been discovered. But Dollo, using
the very same series of forms, showed good reason for reading it in exactly the

opposite direction.

The series is as follows :

     1. Dipterus Valenciennesii Sedgw. and Murch., from the Orcadian Old Red,

and the oldest Dipnoan with whose shape we are acquainted, has two dorsal fins

with short bases, a heterocercal caudal, and one short-based anal.

     2. Dipterus macropterus Traq., from a somewhat higher horizon in the
Orcadian series, has the base of the second dorsal much extended, the other fins
remaining as before.

     3. In f'caumenacia curta (Whiteaves), from the Upper Devonian of Canada,

tLe first dorsal has advanced considerably towards the head, and its base has now

become elongated, while the second has become still larger and more extended,
though still distinct from the caudal posteriorly.

     4. In Thaneropleurun Andcrsoni Huxley, from the Upper Old Eed of Fife-
shire, the two dorsal fins are now fused with each other and with the caudal,
forming- a long continuous tin along the dorsal margin, while the tail has become

nearly diphycercal, with elongation of the base of the lower division of the fin.
But the anal still remains separate, narrow, and short-based.

    5. In the Carboniferous Uronemus lobatus Ag. the anal is now also assorted

in the lower division of the caudal, forming now, likewise on the haemal aspect, a
continuous median fin beliind the ventrals. There is also a last and feeble remnant
of a tendency to an upward direction of the extremity of the vertebral axis.

      6. In the recent Ceratodus Fursteri Krefit, the tail is diphycercal (secondary
dipliycercy), the median fins are continuous, the pectorals and ventrals retain the
biserial archipterygium, but the cranial roof-bones have become few.

     7. In Pvotojiterus annecte-ns Owen, the body is more eel-like, and the paired
fins have lost the lanceolate leatlike appearance which they show in Ceratodiis
and the older Dipnoi. They are like slender filaments in shape, with a fringe on
one side of minute dermal rays ; internally they retain the central jointed axis of
the ' archipterygium,' but according to Wiedersheim the radials are gone, except

it may be one pair at the very base of the filament.

     8. Finally in Lepidusiren jMradoxa Fitz. the paired fins are still more reduced,
having become very small and short, with only the axis remaining.

From this point of view, then, Dipterus, instead of being the most specialised

Dipnoan, is the most archaic, and the modern Ceratodiis, Protojjtencs, and Lept-

dosiren are degenerate forms, and instead of the Crossopterygii being the offspring

of Dipferus-like forms, it is exactly the other way, the Dipnoi owing their origin

to Holoptychiidfe, which again are a specialisation on the Rhizodontidae, though

they did not survive so long as these in geological time. Consequently the

Ceratodiis limb, with its long median segmented axis and biserial arrangement of

radials, is not an archypterygium in the literal sense of the word, but a deri-

vative form traceable to the short uniserial type in the Rhizodonts, But from

what form of fin that was derived is a question to which palajontology gives

us no answer, for the progenitors of the Crossopterygii are as yet unknown to us.

Plausible and attractive as this theory undoubtedly is, and though it relieves

the palaeontologist from many difficulties which force themselves upon his mind

if he tries to abide by the belief that the Dipnoan form of limb had a selachian

origin, and was in turn handed on by them to the Crossopterygii, yet it is not

without its own stumbling-blocks.

First as to the dentition, on which, however, M. Dollo does not seem to put

much stress, it is impossible to derive Dipterus directhj from the Holoptychiidse,
unless it suddenly acquired, as so many of us have to do as we grow older, a

new set of teeth. The dendrodont dentition of Holoptychhis could not in any

way be transformed into the ctenodont or ceratodont one of Dipterus : both are
highly specialised conditions, but in different directions. Semon has recently

shown that the tooth-plates of the recent Ceratodus arise from the concrescence of

Nownumerous small simple conical teeth, at first separate from each other.'

this stage in the embryo of the recent form represents to some extent the con-

dition in the Uronemidse of the Carboniferous and Lower Permian, which stand

quite in the middle of Dollo's series.

Again, the idea of the origin of the Dipnoi from the Crossopterygii in the

manner sketched above cuts ofi' every thought of a genetic connection between
the biserial archipterygium in them and in the Pleuracantbidse, so that we should

have to believe that this very peculiar type of limb arose independently in the

WeSelachii as a parallel development. It may be asked, "VVhy not ?  may feel

perfectly assured that the autostylic condition of the skull in the Holocephali

' 'Die Za-h-nentY/ickelwrig des Ceratodv 8 Forste7-i.' Jena, 1899.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                      779

arose independently of that in the Dipnoi, as did likewise a certain amount of
resemblance in their dentition. But those who from embryological grounds

oppose any notion of the origin of the Dipnoi from ' Ganoids ' might here say, if

they chose, If so, why should not also the same lorm of limh have been inde-

pendently evolved in Crossopterygii ?

Accordingly, while philosophic palreontology is much indebted to M. Dollo for

his brilliant essay, and though we must agree with him in many things, such as

that the Crossopterygii were not derived froin the Dipnoi, and that the modern

representatives of the latter group are degenerate forms, yet as to the immediate

ancestry of the Dipnoi themselves, and the diphyletic origin of the so-called

archipterygium, we had best for the present keep an open mind.

In his * Catalogue of the Fossil Fishes ' in the British Museum (vol. ii. 1891)

Dr. Smith Woodward, following the suggestion of Newberry in 1875, classified the

Coccostsans or ' Arthrodira ' as an extremely specialised group of Dipnoi. At first

I was much taken with that idea, but after looking more closely into the subject

MyI began to doubt it extremely.  own opinion at present is that the Coccosteans

are Teleostomi belonging to the next order, Actinopterygii ; but Prof. Bashford

Dean, of New York, will not have them to be even ' hshes,' but places them in a

distinct class of * Arthrognatha,' which he places next to the Ostracophori

( = Ostracodermi), even hinting at a possible union with them, whereby the old
' Placodermata ' of McCoy would be restored. It will, therefore, be better to leave

them out of consideration for the present, pending a thorough re-examination of

their structure and affinities.

    We come then to the great order of Actinopterygii, to which a large number

of the fishes of later Palaeozoic age belong, as well as the great mass of those

of Mesozoic, Tertiary, and Modern times. Of these we first take into considera-

tion the oldest sub-order, namely, the Acipenseroidei or Sturgeon tribe, in which

the dermal rays of the median tins are more numerous than their supporting

ossicles, while the tail is, in most, completely heterocercal. And the oldest family

of Acipenseroids with which we are acquainted is that of the Pakeoniscidaj,

which, in addition to well-developed cranial and facial bones, has the body

normally covered with rhombic ganoid scales furnished with peg-and-socket articu-

lations. Of this family one genus, Cheirolepis, appears in the same Devonian strata

(Orcadian series) with the earliest known Crossopterygii, and of its immediate

ancestry we know no more than we do of theirs. Cheirolepis is a fully evolved

palseoniscid, as shown by its oblique suspensorium, wide gape, and other points

of its structure. In the Lower Carboniferous rocks of Scotland, where the family

attains an enormous development, we find one or two genera, e.g. Canobius,

which appear less specialised, as the suspensorium is nearly vertical, and the

mouth consequently smaller.

This family endures up to the Purbeck division of the Jurassic formation, and

in the Carboniferous Cn/phiolepis, the Lower Permian Trissolepis, and the Jurassic

Coccolepis we find the same degeneration of the rhombic scales into those of a

circular form and imbricating arrangement, which we find repeated in other groups

of ' Ganoids.' In fact, in one Carboniferous genus, Thanerosteon, the scales

disappear altogether with the exception of those on the body prolongation in the

upper lobe of the caudal fin, and a few just behind the shoulder-girdle.

    And in these Palaeozoic times we notice also a side branch of the Palseoniscidae,

constituting the family PJatysomidae, in which, while the median fins acquire

elongated bases, the body becomes shortened up and deep in contour. The scales

become high and narrow, their internal rib and articular spine coincident with the

anterior margin ; the suspensorium, too, instead of swinging back as in the typical

Palseoniscidae, tends to be directed obliquely forward, while the snout becomes

simultaneouslv elongated in front of the nares.

   A most interesting series of forms can be set up, beginning with Euri/notuf,

which, though it has the platysomid head contour and a long-based dorsal, has

only a slight deepening of the body, and still retains the palseoniscid squamation

and a short-based anal fin. In Mesolepis, which resembles Eurynotus in shape,

being only slightly deeper, we have now the characteristic platysomid squamation,
                          ^

780 REPORT-- 1900,

and the base of the anal fin is considerably elongated. Platysomus has a still more

elongated anal fin, and the body is rhombic ; while in Chcirodus the body is still
deeper in contour, with peculiar dorsal and ventral peaks, long fringing dorsal and

anal fins, while the ventrals seem to have disappeared altogether. Here also, as in

the allied genus Cheirodopsis, the separate cyliudro-conical teeth characteristic of

the family are, on the palatal and spleuial bones, replaced by dental plates, remind-

ing us of those of the Dipnoi. Certainly the Platysomidse seem to me to form a

morphological series telling as strongly in favour of Descent as any other in the

domain of palaeontology.

If we njw return to the Palaeoniscida3 we find that they dwindled away in

numbers in the Jurassic rocks, and finally became extinct at the close of that

epoch. But already in the Lias (leaving the Triassic Catopteridfe out of considera-
tion for the present) we find that they have sent off another ofi'shoot sufficiently
distinct to be reckoned as a new and separate family, namely, the Chondrosteidte,

in which the path of degeneration, in all but the matter of size, seems to have been

entered on.

In the genus C/iondrosteu/i, though the palajoniscid type is clearly traceable

in the cranial structure, there is marked degeneration as regards the amount of

ossification, and though the suspensorium is still obliquely directed backward the

toothless jaws are comparatively short, and the mouth seems now to have become

tucked in under the snout as in the recent sturgeon. Then the scales have entirely

disappeared from the skin except on the upper lobe of the heterocercal caudal fin,

where they are still found arranged exactly as in the Palseoniscida".

   --Chondrosteus in fact conducts us to the recent Acipenseroids the Poly-

odontidas (Paddle-fishes) and Acipenseridse (Sturgeons).

The first of these resembles Cho7jdrosteus in the nakedness of the skin, except

on the upper lobe of the caudal fin,'^ tbe more palteoniscid aspect of the external

cranial plates, such of them as remain, for they are now still further reduced. But

in front of the mouth and eyes there is an addition in the form of an enormous

vertically flattened paddle-shaped snout covered above and below with a large

number of small ossifications.

     The sturgeons have, however, nearly altogether lost the palseoniscid arrange-
ment of the cranial roof-bones, which, strange to say, now exhibit an arrangement

reminding us of that in Dipferus, and the external facial plates are still more

reduced than even in Poh/odon                                                                                                                                                 but we  may note  a very  strong  resemblance  to
                                                                                                                                                                           ;

Chondrosteus in the position of the mouth, the edentulous jaws, and the jugal

bone, indeed also in the palatal apparatus.

So the sturgeons and paddle-fishes of the present day would seem to be the

degenerate, though bulky, descendants of the once extensively developed group of

PalaeoniscidDC, even as the modern Dipnoi are degenerated from those of Palaeozoic

times.

   We now notice another apparent offshoot of the Palreoniscidas, namely, the

family of CatopteridEe {Catopterus and Dictyopyge), which is limited to rocks of

Triassic age. Unfortunately the osteology of the head is not well known, but Dr.

Smith Woodward's observations are to the effect that both the head and shoulder-

girdle are of palreoniscoid type. The relationship of these small fishes to the

Palseoniscidfe is shown by the general shape, the number and position of the fins,

the rhombic ganoid scales, and the close arrangement of tbe rays of the median

fins. But the rays of the dorsal and anal fins are now almost equal in number to

their supporting ossicles, and the tail has become only abbreviate heterocercal.

That is to say, the caudal body prolongation no longer proceeds to the termination

of the upper lobe, which is reduced in size and in the number of its rays. The

Woodward prefers to look upon them as Chondrostei (i.e. Acipenseroidei).'
AVherever we place them they express the beginnin<j of a set of changes towards

a more modern type of fish, which are emphasised in the great series of Lepidos-
teold fishes (Protospondyli + ^Etbeospondyli of Smith Woodward), being the fishes
more or less allied to the recent Bony Pilie of North America.

     But these changes must have been well advanced before the Triassic era, for
already in the Upper Permian occurs the genus Acentrophorus, whose fellowship
with Semionotus, Lepidotus, and all the rest of the series of Mesozoic semi-hetero-

cercal ' Ganoids' is at once obvious.

     If we look at the configuration of a typical Jurassic member of this series, such
as Lepidotus or Eugnathus, we shall at once see that we are a .stage nearer the
modern osseous fish. Though the scales are bony, rhombic, and ganoid, we are
struck by the ' Teleostean '-like aspect of the external bones and plates of the
head, the rays of the dorsal and anal fins are fewer and correspond in their number
to that of the internal supports or ' interspinous ' bones, while in the caudal we
see again the semi-heterocercal or abbreviate-heterocercal condition we noticed

above in Catopterus.

     Then if we refer to the tail of Lepidosteus itself we shall observe how few are
its rays and how evident it is that we have here to do only with the lower lobe of
the original palaeoniscoid caudal fin. For a convincing corroboration of this we have

only to look at the tail of the embryo Lejndosteus as described and figured by
Prof. A. Agassiz to see that it in reality passed through an Acipenseroid stage,
and the last we see of the upper lobe of this tail is in the form of a filament
which projects from the top of the original lower lobe and then disappears.

     Again, in these Lepidosteid forms we have a repetition of the same tendency

for the thick rhombic peg-and-socket articulating scales to become rounded and

imbricating as we saw in the Crossopterygii and again iu the Palfeoniscidae. So,
for instance, in Caturus, which has been shown by Dr. Smith Woodward to

resemble Eugnathus so closely in structure, the scales are deeply overlapping, and
most of them ' cycloidal ' in shape. To such an extent does this go that in the
recent Ainia, whose skeletal structure so clearly shows it to belong to this group,
the rounded scales are so thin and flexible that after it was removed from the
Clupeoid family, or Herrings, and placed among the 'Ganoids,' it was considered
to be the type of a distinct sub-order of 'Amioidei.' Ten years ago, however,
Dr. Beard came to the conclusion, from anatomical and embryological data, that
this division could no longer be maintained, and that the Amioids must in fact

be united with the Lepidosteids.^ Dr. Smith Woodward has, therefore, in the

third volume of his catalogue, done well to reduce the 'Amioidei' to the rank
of a family, including also the Jurassic genera Liodesmus and Megalurus, and to

place this family close to the Eugnathidce.

     As the Acipenseroid s dwindled away after the close of the great Paljeozoic
era, and are now scantily represented only by the degenerate paddle-fishes and

sturgeons, so the Lepidosteid series, flourishing greatly in the Trias and Jura, in their

turn declined in the Cretaceous, and in the Tertiary period became about as much
a thing of the past as they are now, the North American Lepidosteus and Amia,
of which remains of extinct species have also been found in Eocene and Miocene
rocks, only remaining. These two genera can, however, hardly be called ' degenerate.'

     But that the fishes which succeeded the Lepidosteids in populating the seas

    ' Dr. Smith Woodward also refers the singular Belonorhynchidas of the Trias to
the same sub-order on account of the excess of the number of the dermal rays of the
dorsal and anal over that of their supporting ossicles, even although the tail is here

abbreviate diphycercal.

 and rivers of the glohe were evolved from tliem there can be no reasonable doubt,
 while it is equally clear that they branched off at an early period, as already in

the Trias we find the first representatives of the order of Isospondyli, which

 contains our familiar Herrings, Salmonids, Elopids, Scopelids, &c. For Dr. Smith
 AVoodward has not only definitely placed the Jurassic Leptolepidre and Oligo-
plenridce in the Isospondyli, but also the Pholidophoridse, which appear in the

Trias and extend to the Purbeck. And it is of special interest that in the

Pholidophori the scales are still brilliantly ganoid and mostly retain the peg-and-
sochet articulation, while in the allied Leptolepidoa, although they have become
thin and circular, a layer of ganoine mostl}' remains.

   -- --With the Isospondyli we now get fairly among the bony fishes of modern

type Teleostei as we used to call them to which other sub-orders are added in

(iretaceoua and Tertiary times, and which in the present day have assumed an
overwhelming numerical preponderance over all other fishes. The prevalent form
of scale among these is thin, rounded, deeply imbricating, and with the posterior
margin either plain (cycloid) or serrated (ctenoid). But that these 'cycloid ' and

* ctenoid ' scales are modifications from the rhombic osseous ' ganoid ' type we
cannot doubt after what we have seen. It is indeed strange that the same

tendency to the change of rhombic into circular overlapping scales should have
occurred independently in more than one group.

     For reasons given at the beginning, and also because I fear I have already

exceeded the limit of time usually allotted to such an Address, I must now stop.
     But in conclusion I may allude to a well-known fact regarding the tail of

these modern fishes, the bearing of which on the doctrine of Descent is sufficiently

clear and has long been recognised.

    We have seen that the completely beterocercal tail of the typical Acipenseroid

becomes, by abortion of the upper lobe and shortening of the axis, the semi-
heterocercal one of the Lepidosteids, in most of which, however, the want of
symmetry is still perceptible externally by a short projection or ' sinus ' of scales
Avhich is directed obliquely upward at the beginning of the top of the fin. In the
ordinary bony fishes and in some Lepidosteids also the caudal fin becomes like-
wise svmmetrical, as seen from the outside generally also bilobate, though the

                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

upper lobe is not that of a Palreoniscid or Sturgeon. This condition of tail has

been long known as ' homocercal.' But in many such homocercal tails, when we
dissect away the skin and soft parts, the upward bend of the vertebral axis is

revealed, and in some, as in the Salmon, the extremity of the vertebral axis is
continued as a cartilaginous style among the rays near the upper margin of the fin.

But there are many others, such, for instance, as the peculiarly specialised group of

Pleuronectidffi or flat fishes, in which the skeleton of the caudal extremity looks
quite symmetrical, but yet in the embryo the extremity of the notochord is seen
to have an upward bend, showing that the homocercal tail is indeed a specialisa-
tion on the old beterocercal one. It is strange that though this embryological
fact was long ago pointed out by Agassiz, and though he noted its great interest in
connection with the prevalence of heterocercy among the Pahcozoic fishes, yet he
remained to the end an opponent of evolution. But this is just one of these
instances in which Phylogeny and Ontogeny mutually illustrate each other.

Why, otherwise, should the tail of the embryo stickleback or flounder be betero-

cercal ?

     Incompletely as I have treated the subject, it cannot but be acknowledged
that the palajontology of fishes is not less emphatic in the support of Descent
than that of any other division of the animal kingdom. But in former days the
evidence of fossil ichthyology was by some read otherwise.

    It is now a little over forty years since Hugh Miller died : he who was one
of the first collectors of the fossil fishes of the Scottish Old Red Sandstone, and
who knew these in some respects better than any man of his time, not excepting

Agassiz himself. Yet his life was spent in a fierce denunciation of the doctrine
of evolution, then only in its Lamarckian form, as Darwin had not yet electrified
the world with his ' Origin of Species.' Many a time I wonder greatly what

Hugh Miller would have thought had he lived a few years longer, so as to have
                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION 0.                    783

been able to see tlie remarkable revolution which was wrought by the publication

of that book.

The main argument on which Miller rested was the ' high ' state of organisa-

tion of the ancient tishes of the Palreozoic formations, and this was apparently com-

bined with a confident assumption of the completeness of the geological record.

As to the first idea, we know of course that evolution means the passage from

the more general to the more special, and that although as the general result an

onward advance has taken place, yet specialisation does not always or necessarily

mean 'highness' of organisation iu the sense in which the term is usually

employed. As to the idea of the perfection of the geological record, that of

course is absurd.

We do not and cannot know the oldest fishes, as they would not have had hard

parts for preservation, but we may hope to come to know many more old ones,

Myand older ones still, than we do at present.  experience of the subject of fossil

ichthyology is that it is not likely to become exhausted in our day.

   We are introduced at a period far back in geological history to certain groups

of fishes some of which certaiuly are high in organisation as animals, but yet of

generalised type, being fishes and yet having the potentiality of higher forms.

But, because their ancestors are unknown to us, that is no evidence that they did

not exist, and cannot overthrow the morphological testimony in favour of

Weevolution with which the record actually does furnish us.  may therefore

feel very sure that fishes, or ' fish-like vertebrates,' lived long ages before the

oldest forms with which we are acquainted came into existence.

The modern type of bony fish, though not so 'high' in many anatomical

points as that of the Selachii, Crossopterygii, Dipnoi, Acipensea-oidei, and

Lepidosteoidei of the Pal.'Bozoic and Mesozoie eras, is more specialised in the

direction of the fish proper, and, as already indicated, specialisation and'hio-h-

uess ' in the ordinary sense of the w^ord are not necessarily coincident. But ideas

about these things have undergone a wonderful change since those pre-Darwinian

days, and though we shall never be able fully to unravel the problems concerning

the descent of animals, we see many things a great deal more clearly now than
we did then.

                By Professor S. J. HiCKSON, 3I.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.

      Plate denied the existence of true ' Nehenkerne,' or micron uclei, in Dendro-
cometes, and Schneider was unable to prove their existence. There can be no
doubt, however, that such bodies do occur, and I have been able by the improved
methods of preservation and staining to trace all the important stages of their
mitosis. Maupas asserted that in the Suctoria there is only one micronucleus, and
that it is very smnll. If this is true of the Suctoria generally, Dendrocometes is
exceptional, as there is reason for believing that at least two and sometimes three
or four micronuclei occur, each of which is as large as or larger than the micronuclei
of Parmnoecium, caudatmn. During conjugation one micronucleus from each

individual passes down the connecting bar, and there can be no doubt that a

fusion of micronuclei occurs, although the whole series of stages of this process
has not yet been observed.

     The macronuclei of the conjugating individuals are very much elongated and

pointed at their extremities. In several cases I have observed that one end of the

macronucleus of each conjugating individual passes down the connecting bar, and
in one specimen an actual fusion of the two macronuclei was seen.

     It would be premature to discuss the meaning of this conjugation of the
macronuclei at present, but there can be no doubt of the bearing of this fact upon
the prevalent view that the conjugation of Infusoria is entirely an affair of
micronuclei. At the end of conjugation the macronucleus disintegrates, as in the

Ciliata. The new macronucleus, which makes its appearance during the early

stages of the disintegration of the old macronucleus, is at first clear, homogeneous,

and almost devoid of chromatin. The chromatin accumulates in it as the frag-
ments of the old macronucleus disintegrate.

     The structure of the macronucleus has been very carefully reinvestigated.

Details of the results will be published later, but it may be stated here that the

division of the macronucleus during gemmation is purely amitotic. There are no
centrosomes and no achromatic spindle.

     In this investigation I have been very materially assisted by Mr. T. J.
Wadsworth, of the Owens College laboratory.

     The iron haematoxylin method of staining has been principally used, but
valuable results have also been obtained by a new method of using brazilin with

iron-alum.

5. Cycloina in Osseous Fishes. By James F. Gemmill, M.A., M.D.

In this paper an outline is given of the anatomy of some cyclopean trout

embi-yos                                           the  conditions  present  are  contrasted with  those  which  are  found  in

similar cases among the higher animals, and their general bearing is briefly discussed.

               Summary of Chief Points relating to Cyclopia in the Trout.

     1. In all the specimens examined dLstincfc olfactory organs and nerves of
reduced size are present.

       2. Dl*opsy of the central cavities of the train or of the meninges Is remarkatle

 for its absence. The cerebral lobes are more or less united, but they may attain

 a very fair degree of development. Pineal growths are present as in the normal

 condition,

      3. Trabeculm cranii of full length are present, but they bend downwards so as
to lie below the cyclopean eye or pair of eyes. They are closely fused together

anteriorly to form a single median bar, the appearance of which suggests that in
this region they have never been separate.

      4. In some of the specimens examined cyclopia is associated with absence of
the mouth opening and great shortening of the lower jaw arch.

     In these cases the infundibulum and the whole pituitary body are absent,
the basal masses of the mid-brain are more or less fused together, the optic nerves
are rudimentary or absent, and the eyes, though they have a well-developed
retina and choroid, have no choroidal fissure. The auditory labyrinths and capsules
on either side as well as the suspensorial cartilages remain, however, almost as
widely separate as in the normal condition.

8. On some Points in the Life-History of the Littoral Fishes.
            By Professor W. C. McIntosh, F.R.S.

No group of marine fishes is better fitted for the demonstration of the great

mortality which ensues between the period of the deposition of the eggs and the
attamment of the adult condition than the littoral' fishes, such as the shanny,

viviparous blenny, sea-scorpion, lumpsucker(;>«rfm), gunnel, fifteeu-spined stickle-

back, and the five-bearded rockling. The adults, for instance, of the shanny can,

as a rule, be readily located in the pools between tide-marks on rocky shores. The

adult female deposits a considerable number of eggs in small rocky caverns, and
the pelagic young abound in the tidal pools in August and September. As they

increase in size they become fewer, not by spreadincr themselves in the ocean or
by taking advantage of new sites amongst the rocks, but by steady diminution
from the attacks of other predatory forms. One or two adults alone survive in
each suitable rock-pool. In the group under consideration the conditions of the

species are various, the majority, however, having demersal eggs, which in the

case of the gunnel are protected by the parents, and in the fifteen-spined stickle-
back are sheltered in a nest, whilst the reckling has pelagic eggs, and the vivi-

parous blenny produces living young fully two inches in length. The result is

nearly the same in each case, for the adults do not, as a rule, vary much from
Aperiod to period.
                    comparatively large number of eggs and young are necessary

to maintain the species, even though in our country there is no systematic capture
of any of them either for food or pleasure.

                                    By Marcus Hartog, M.A., D.Sc, F.L.S.

In 189G I comnmnicated to the Association a note in wbicli I referred incident-

ally to the discovery of a peptic zymase in the embryo of the frog at a stage when

the macromeres appear as a white plug' in the region of the blastopore, in the

entire embryo of the chick after twenty-four hours, and in the extravascular

blastoderm after three days' incubation. These observations were made by the

classic method of killing and coagulating with absolute alcohol, drying and

powdering, extracting with glycerine, precipitating with absolute alcohol, and

ascertaining the properties of this precipitate on boiled white of egg and

Aboiled blood-fibrin. In successive years I obtained only negative results.

hint from Professor J. Reynolds Green gave me the explanation of these con-

tradictory results. In 1896 I had the valuable assistance of Mr. E. J. Butler,

and was able to carry through each series of experiments continuously ; while in

the three following years they were protracted indefinitely. This spring I was

able to confirm my original results, changing my methods to avoid delay and con-

sequent loss of zymase. The objects themselves were killed in chloroform- or

thymol-water and pounded ; and instead of using other substances for diges-

tion' I contented myself with the abundant material of the vitelline granules

present in each case within the cell.

I relied in all cases on the ' biuret test' of Piotrowsky, consisting in warming

the product of digestion (after neutralising, boiling, and filtering to remove all acid-

albumen) with strong caustic alkali and a trace of copper sulphate; the pink

coloration reveals the presence of albumoses or peptones. On some occasions the

chick-blastoderm tests turned j-ellowish brown as the temperature continued to

rise, and on boiling there was an abundant dark precipitate, indicating the presence of
Aa reducing body.
                                  zymase capable of yielding such a product has recently been

described by Miiller, who, however, has only found it active in neutral liquids.

    No trace of any other ferment has been found so far ; it is noteworthy that all

observers are agreed in the recognition of a 2wptic ferment only in the holozoic

Protista.

   --Frog embryos kept in thymol water in a stoppered jar in the dark in a closed

--locker for a month had lost all digestive properties.

    Two important conclusions appear to follow :

1. In all plants, so far as is known, it has been shown that the cell cannot

directly utiHse the reserves that it contains, but only the products of their hydro-

lysis                             and tliis hydrolysis is not a function of  the  living protoplasm  itself, but  of
                           ;

the zymases it forms, since the process can be reproduced in vitro working with

the killed cell or its extract. It would seem almost certain that the same law

holds good for the animal cell.

2. These facts explain the apparent exception to the law of division at the

doubling of the volume formulated by Herbert Spencer, as I indicated in my,
Anote of 1896.
                                  cell that instead of growing by its protoplasm only accumulates

reserve material has no need to constantly readjust its surface to its volume.

"When, however, the formation of a zymase enables it to utilise its reserves, and

its protoplasm grows at the expense of the products of their digestion, the need for

augmented surface asserts itself, and we get the repeated cell-divisions so marked

in the ' segmentation ' of the embryo and in other cases of brood-formation. It
follows also that two distinct processes have been compounded under the single

term of 'anabolism:' («) the building up and storage of reserves; (h) the
growth of the protoplasm at the expense of nourishment from without, or the

digestion of the reserves within. From this point of view the segmentation of the

embryo is certainly an anabolic process of the second category, aiid not mainly

catabolic, as usually stated.

     These results are cutlous and interesting, for they seem to show thit the
proportions of water and solid contents are practically the same in the fresh egg

and in the newly hatched chicken.
     Ultimate analyses were made of the dry matter contained in the fresh egg

and in the dried chicken. After deducting the weight of the shell and water
from the total weight of the egg, there remained 13-21 grammes of dry matter.

     The increase of ash in the chicken is ohviously due to lime being absorbed
from the shell, and combined with phosphorus present in the yolk.

     The increase of nitrogen (equal to 1-13 per cent.) is apparently due to the
decrease of carbon. This also applies to the increase of oxygen. The decrease of
carbon (5-35 per cent.) and hydrogen (0-92 per cent.) is due to their oxidation,
and may be (in part) accounted for as carbonic acid and water passing through

the shell during incubation.

    Seemingly we have a rearrangement of the elements above named, and the

fact established that water becomes altered into potential living matter, repre-
senting the tissues and feathers of the living bird, &c., whilst the ash is also
increased hy the abstraction of lime from the shell, combined with the phosphorus
derived from the yolk during the hatching process.

        1. Mnestra parasites, ^/'o/mi. Preliminary Account.

By R. T. Gunther, M.A., F.R.G.S., Magdalen College, Oxford.

During the spring of the present year the prevailing westerly winds no douht

contributed to the fact that an unusually large number of P/ii/llirkoe bucephala were

captured in the Bay of Naples. I examined every specimen 1 could get hold of

and found that of thirty-one individuals of Phyllirhoe taken between March 28

and April 20 nineteen, or more than half, had a Mnestra adhering to them. My

friend Cavaliere Lo Bianco in the kindest way placed his store of spirit-preserved

material at my disposal for examination. Unfortunately the dates of capture

were not noted, but of forty-three Phyllirhoe every one had or had had a Mnestra

upon it.

From this relative abundance of the parasite it follows that the reproductive

power of the Mnestra must be far and away in excess of that of the Phyllirhoe

bucephala of the Bay of Naples. Indeed, the fertility of Mnestra must, one would

think, be greater than is usual even among parasites. It is therefore most remark-

able that hitherto the method of the propagation of Mnestra should have remained

Weundiscovered.  do not know whether it reproduces itself by a sexual or an

asexual process, by eggs or budding.

     It was in consequence of our ignorance of this point that systematists have not

--been able to assign Mnestra to its proper place in the system of Haeckel which

primarily depends upon the place of development of the genital cells in the Medusa.

I have, however, been fortunate enough to discover other characteristics of the

Mnestra which will enable us to unhesitatingly affirm that it should be classed

with the Cladonemida, a family of the Anthomedusse.

The Mnestra is attached to the Phyllirhoe by its manubrium, which is com-

paratively short and serves the purpose of obtaining nutriment, apparently by

sucking the blood of the host. The shape oi the body of the Mnestra varies greatly.

The margin of the umbrella is sometimes notched, but this marginal notch is by

no means so constant in its presence as to justify us in regarding it as Claus

did, a characteristic of Mnestra. The shape of the Medusa can be well described

as that of a bun with a large inpushing or * dimple ' in the middle of the exumbral

surface, from which, in typical cases, four furrows proceed interradially to the

margin. It is by the intensification of one of these grooves that the notch of

Claus is often produced. The symmetry of the velum and circular canal is

generally not much affected by these furrows on the surface of the ex-umbrella.

The tentacles are four in number. The majority of specimens examined had

two reduced to mere knobs, and some had three or even all the tentacles reduced

to this condition. It seemed to me that the reduction of the tentacle was a mark

          ' Claus, Verh, Z^ol. Bot. Tr\st., Wign, j,xv, 187?,
790  '                  REPORT-- 1900.

Aof old age.  well-developed tentacle of Mnestra is a compound tentacle of

undoubted Cladonemid type. The base is swollen and simple, but the distal

portion is slfudtr and tapering-, with a row of small stalked multinucleate club-

shaped bodies along the entire length of one margin. These bodies contain

nematocysts, and they are undoubtedly homologous with the stalked clubs

containing thread cells of many of the Cladonemid genera.

   A further poiut of resemblance between Mnestra jmrasites and certain of the

Cladonemidse is in the fact that there is a circular tract of nematocysts arranged

round the umbrella margin, close to the circular canal, and from this circular

tract extend four centripetal tracts along the perradii of the ex-umbrella. These

perradial tracts usually extend as far as the exumbral ' dimple ' and sometimes

continue down into it.

The gastro-vascular system is of the usual type. There are a central stomach,

four radial canals, and a circular canal. The stomach is of an irregular shape and

is orten provided with irregular diverticula in which corpuscles which originally

belonged to the blood of the Phyllirhoe may sometimes be seen. The mouth is

clogged with endoderm cells with intercellular spaces through which the organism

imbibes its nutriment.

Among the 100 odd individuals examined a number of varieties and abnormal

Aforms were observed.   description of these ao well as the histology of Mnestra

will shortly be published in the Naples ' Mittheilungen.'

     9. The Dentition of the Seal. By E. J. Anderson, M.A., M.D.,

                            Professor of Natural History, Gahvay.

    The dentition of the common seal is generally understood to be in the great majo-
rity of cases f I., ^ C, ^ P.-m., ^ M. There may be an additional premolar, due to
the persistence of one of the milk-teeth. The molars are not too much crowded
in the upper jaw, but more so in the lower. The incisors have standing room, but
the central of the lower jaw show a disposition to stand back ; the small platform
on which the latter seem to stand narrows anteriorly, and the sockets are deeply
sunk in front of tjiis pique. The four inpigors of the Jower jaw correspond to the
                                                                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                ' ^91

inner four of the upper jaw when the teeth are met, and are about the same size as

these latter, whilst the two upper lateral incisors are larger than the inner two, but

are far removed from the canines both in position and size. The comparison of the

dentition of the seal with that of the polecat, the grisou, and especially the otter,

is instructive. The badger may be said to occupy a place between bears and

weasels, and tlie upper incisors have carnivor type, formula, and arrangement. In

the upper set the incisors are not embarrassed, although they stand three abreast

on each side, as in better marked carnivors. In the badger the intermediates in

the lower jaw stand back out of range, as in Putorius and Galictis. In the upper jaw

of the otter the incisors are in range, but the second incisors of the lower jaw stand

back, as if the teeth were crushed up. It is noteworthy that the first premolar of

the upper jaw in this animal is placed internal to the canine, while the first pre-

molar of the lower jaw is placed at an interval behind the canine.

All the molar teeth of the common seal except the first are well known to

have two fangs ; as regards the cusps, the precise arrangement is not generally

stated. The cusps of the upper molars fit into intervals between the cusps of one

lower molar or of separate adjacent molars. The first premolar has a large front

cusp with a shoulder (an approach to the formation of a cusp) in front, and a small

Acusp behind.                                                     slight groove passes forwards and inwards, marking oft" an enamelled

surface internal to the cusps. The second upper premolar has a large central cusp,

a shoulder in front and to the inner side of this ; and two cusps, one immediately

behind the larger and one still farther back. The third premolar has a shoulder

in front and internal to a large cusp ; then there are two smaller cusps in succes-

sion to this posteriorly. The fourth has a blunter chief cusp, slight irregularities

on the inner shoulder, and a second cusp, with an attempt at the formation of a

third cusp still farther back ; this tooth is more like the last molar of the otter
than the previous teeth are. The molar has a large middle cusp, with a slightly

smaller one behind it and a small cusp anteriorly. The Jirst lower premolar has

three cusps                                                       the anterior is the smallest, and the central  one next.  The cusps are
                                                               ;

placed near the outer surface of the tooth ; internal to and behind the middle one

is an elevation .suggestive of a fourth cusp. The second premolar has a large cen-

tral cusp curved somewhat back, a small cusp in front of this, and two behind

there is a platform internal to the cusps. The third premolar has/o?/)- cusps: the

front cusp small, the second the largest and turned back, the two posterior smaller.

'ihe fourth premolar has five cusps: two small ones in front of the large one, and

two behind it ; the central cusp is bent back. The molar has one cusp in front of

and two behind the central cusp, which is not prominent. This tooth is very

small, and has a bulging opposite each of the first three cusps. The contrast in

the comparison of the incisors of the lion, hytena, and dog with those in the lower

jaw of the badger, the polecat, and otter is well worth notmg. In the otter there

would not be room for the intermediate (second) incisor to stand in rank. The

second incisors in the bear stand somewhat back, but the sockets are placed behind

the level of the third pair of incisors. It may seem likely that the habits of the

badger and weasel should render a narrow lower jaw desirable anteriorly, but it

is not clear that the otter would be well served by the same device. The lower

jaw of a very young soal which was examined has lost the lower incisors, but the

sockets are suggestive of a nearer approach to the otter arrangement.

    Halichserus grypus has the same dental formula as the common seal. The

last molar of the upper jaw is at some distance from the other back teeth, which

are all pointed with single cusps. In some, however, there is a shoulder suggestive

of a second cusp. This is the case in the last lower, where a slight indication of a

Acusp exists behind the pointed cone.                             furrow is visible on the outer sides of the

third and fifth lower and second and fifth upper. The lower canines extend

between the upper corner incisors and the upper canines, which are about the same

length as the corner incisors, but much thicker.

     The following animals have the intermediate incisor behind the inner and outer,

--either from base to apex or at the base alone : Paradoxurus, Ailurus, Her-

pestes mungos, Lutra, Galictis, Gulo, Conepatus, Brown Bear, the Malayan

                          By G. E. H. Barrett-Hamiltok.

    I am indebted to the authorities of the British Museum of Natural History for

the opportunity of studying the collection of seals brought home from the antarctic
seas by the Belgica, and now the property of the 'Expedition Antarctique Beige.'

     The collection is not a large one, and consists almost entirely of specimens of
the Phoctdes, the Otariidm being represented by only one very immature skull.

     One of the main points of interest regarding the specimens is the fact that they
afford no support whatsoever to the supposition, sometimes advanced, that some
startUngly new forms of marine Carnivora will be found to occur in the antarctic
seas. All the species known to occur in these seas, except the (perhaps extinct)
sea elephant, are represented in the collection. Thus there are skulls of Leptomj-
chotes weddeli, Ofjmorhinus leptonyx, Lobodon carcinoijhaga, and Omniatophoca
rossii; but all these are framed on patterns so close to those of the older specimens

in the British Museum that it is impossible (with the present material) to find even
new sub-specific diflerences amongst them. At the same time it is highly interest-
ing to have a series of specimens of various ages from which to amplify our know-

ledge of the various forms.

     Probably the most interesting species represented in the collection is Ommnto-
phoca rossii, of which there are two skulls. These .are remarkable for the

variability of their dentition ; a point to which ' Mr. W. Bateson has already drawn
attention with reference to the only two previously known skulls. It seems now

certain that variability of dentition must be regarded as one of the characteristics
of Ross's seal, and it is interesting to know that this variability is not shared by
the other species of antarctic Phocidce, all the specimens which I have examined
being quite uniform and showing no abnormalities.

     I hope at a later date to publish a more detailed account of these skulls.
The following were exhibited at the Section: Ommatoplioca rossii (two skulls)
and Lobodon carcinophaga.

     The following Papers were read :

   1. Photographs of some Malayan Insects."^ By Nelson Ankandale.

     The photographs were taken from living insects in the Siamese Malay States
last year. The first represented a Stauropiis larva not dissimilar to the English

--Lobster Caterpillar on its food -plant, Melastoma poh/antJmm the so-called

' Straits Rhododendron.' When it is about to change its skin this larva resembles

a bird's dropping, and is then sluggish in its movements ; but after the ecdysis has
taken place, the insect becomes active again, and keeps its true legs and the pro-
cesses on the posterior region of its abdomen in constant agitation. Its colour
also changes considerably.

     The second photograph represented a portion of the stem of a living Areca-
Tialm, with a small Geometrid caterpillar that conceals itself by plastering frag-
ments of a powdery lichen upon its own back.

     The third and fourth photographs showed two species of a peculiar type of larva,
supposed to belong to Lycid beetles, and noticeable for its flattened bodv, minute

retractile head, and for the processes that project in a series along the sides of the

abdomen. Nothing is known as to the metamorphosis of these larvae, and some

examples of the type reach a size considerably greater than that of any Lycid

beetle as yet discovered. The two species shown in the photographs are found

together, beneath the bark of dead trees and under fallen timber in the jungle.

The broader and more highly specialised of the two bears no resemblance, as far

as I have been able to discover, to any other animal ; but the narrower species,
which in its younger stages differs very little from the ordinary type of Lycid

larva, is not unlike a Millipede {Ortliomor'pha sp.) found together with it.
     The fifth and three following photographs showed a pupa of the mantis Hijmeno-

pits bicornis seated on an inflorescence of Melastoma polycmtJmm. In its active

pupal stage this insect bears so close a likeness to the flowers of the ' Rhododen-

dron ' that I have found it impossible to assign the exact limits of true vegetable

tissue and animal counterfeit, even when holding in my hand an inflorescence in

which one of these mantises was seated. The resemblance is brought about by the

development of broad, petal-like expansions of the femora of the second and third

pairs of legs, by the pink coloration of the insect, and by the extraordinary

Ahower-like sheen of its integument.                              broad bar of vivid green runs across the

thorax of the pupa, dividing the animal visually into two perfectly distinct parts :

a black spot is most                      conspicuous on the      tip of  its abdomen                                                            and five brown  lines
                                                                                                                                              ;

mark the dorsal surface of the abdomen longitudinally. The mantis refuses to

settle on any other part of the plant than the inflorescence. It sits among the

flowers with its abdomen flexed backwards, so as to lie almost parallel to the

thorax                                    and it sways its whole  body from side  to side.  The movement attracts
                                       ;

certain minute flies, which settle indiscriminately on the body of the insect (being

then indistinguishable at the short distance from the black tip of the abdomen)

and on the petals it simulates. The mantis takes no notice of these small flies,

but seizes and devours larger Diptera, and probably other insects, that come within

its reach. When the flowers among which it is seated commence to fade, the

mantis droops its abdomen, thus bringing the brown lines upon the dorsal surface

into view, and finally leaps to the ground. When separated from the inflorescence

of Melastoma polijanthimi, it xe&Qmhles im orchid that has fallen from its stem.

Hymenopiis bicornis has a fairly wide distribution (from Sikkim to Sarawak), but
Ait is rare in every locality where it occurs.
                                                                                  white variety of the pupa is also

known.

The ninth photograph showed some Siamese of the State of Patalung clapping

their hands to attract the edible cicada {Dundubia iiiteonerata). In April the

females of this insect are thus captured in considerable numbers for food, during

the_ short interval between sunset and darkness. The cicada-catchers must clap

Atheir hands in unison and observe a definite rhythm.                                       fire is a usual, but not a

necessary, adjunct to the performance.

The enormous elongation of the anterior region of the head of many Fulgorinse

(lantern flies) into a hollow nose-like organ has often puzzled entomologists,

who have generally abandoned the old theory that this structure was lumi-

nescent. I was so fortunate as to observe its use as an organ of progression, or

rather of sudden flight from danger. When the insect is disturbed, it presses the

tip of its ' nose ' against the tree-stem on which it is seated, at the same instant
pushes its body violently away with its powerful legs, and so is projected for a

considerable distance through the air, the ' nose ' being flexible at one point, and

also so elastic that it acts as a piece of whalebone would do under like circum-

Btances.

              2. Observations on Mimicry in South African Insects.

                             By Guy A. K. Marshall.

        Jesus College, Oxford, and Hope Professor of Zoology in the University.]

794 REPORT-- 1900.

that the observation was made at Salisbury, JIashonaland (5,0C0 feet). The
observations here briefly recorded have added in a most important manner to our
knowledge of the natural history (bionomics) of South African insects, a subject of
which the foundations were laid by Roland Trimen. Groups of mimetic Lepido-
ptera captured on the same day as their models have been obtained both from Natal
and Mashonaland (Salisbury), thus demonstrating more fully than has been done
hitherto the fact that model and mimic fly at the same time as well as in the same
place. The groups bring out the extraordinary power of Danaine butterflies in, so
to speak, moulding the species of other sub-families into a superficial likeness to

themselves. There are only four or five species of Danmna in the region under

consideration, and each one of them is the centre of a group of forms superficially
similar, but remote in affinity. The abundant and widespread Limnas c/in/sippus
was largely resembled both in Natal and Mashonaland. In experiments conducted
upon insect-eating animals, this butterfly appeared to be less unpalatable than the
Acrcca (A. encedon) which resembles it. The explanation may be found in the far
wider range of the Danaine model, which would render it familiar to enemies
passing from an area in which the Acrcea does not, to one in which it does exist.

    In the case of two forms of Eiiralia (E. mima and E. ica/ilben/i) mimicking two

very different species of Ammiris {A. echevia and A. dominicanus) there is good
reason to believe that a single species has become dimorphic. Photographs of

four mima (two male, two female) and four icahlbergi (three male, one female) were
shown, the whole set having been part of a company of twelve individuals going to
rest together on a small clump of fern under a steep kraantz, Umbilo Eiver,
Malvern, near Durban, Natal (June 28, 1897). The two forms have also been

taken in coihi, and have been found together freshly emerged from the pupa on the
same tree. Intermediate varieties are also known. If specific identity be established,

the case will constitute a new form of mimetic dimorphism in the Lepidoptera,

similar to that of the Dipterous genus Volucella. All cases of dimorphism in mimetic

Lepidoptera hitherto described are either sexual or confined to a single sex. In one

sex, indeed, a mimetic species may be polymorphic, as in the female of Papilio

certea or Hypolimnas inisippus.
     In the case of tlie distasteful sub-family AcrmntE, the two very different

species A. natalica and A. anemosa were shown captured at Salisbury on the same
day. Although entirely different in detail, the pattern of the two species is broadly
the same, and during flight would probably appear to be identical. Another even
more striking example of Miillerian or synaposematic resemblance was aff'orded by
a set of eighteen specimens belonging to five species of small Acrreas captured on
the same day (December 31, 1898) in the same locality. The whole group pre-
sented a wonderfully uniform appearance in size, shape, colour, and the general

distribution of markings.

    An example of a Hesperid (Baoris netophn) mimic of an Acr(pa {A. doubie-

dayi), the two captured on the same day, added another to the rare instances of
mimicry in this family. The resemblance is onlj' seen in the attitude of rest,
and is confined to the undersides of the wings.

     The aberrant Lycrenid {Alcrno amazoula) has a general Acrreine aspect, and

 is very unlike the Avell-known appearance of its true family. It is probably dis-
tasteful, and is resembled with tolerable closeness, especially upon the under-
sides of the wings, by a day-flying Geometrid moth (Peiovia dichroaria). They
were captured together at Malvern, near Durban, on September 26, 1897.

    A most interesting series of injured specimens of butterflies showed the

 probable attacks of birds or lizards, observations in the field aflxjrding strong sup-

port to this interpretation. Members of the specially protected conspicuous
 groups were, as Fritz Miiller showed in the case of South America, also subject to
 attack. Comparatively few of the injuries were inflicted at the junction of the
 fore and hind wings, or indeed anywhere except at the apex of the fore wing, or,
more commonly still, at the anal angle of the hind wing. In many cases the
 injury was symmetrical, indicating that a piece had been bitten out of both right
 and left wings during the usual attitude of rest, or as they came together momen-
tarily in flight. The two points of special attack are commonly rendered con-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  795

epicuous by special marks, and, in the case of the hind wing, structures such as
' tails,' ' eye-spots,' &c. In the LyctenidcB, where the ' tails' are rendered still fur-

ther prominent by movement, many specimens were captured with these parts

bitten out from one or both of the wings.

     Large additions were also made to our knowledge of mimicry and warning
colours in Coleoptera. In the Carabid genus Anthia, a probable warning character
common to different species consisted in a large white patch, placed in some
species on the sides of the thorax, in others on the anterior surface of the elytra.
The general effect was the same, but the anatomical relations entirely alien. The
characteristic banded pattern of the Cantharidm was shown to be resembled by
beetles of widely different groups, the spotted pattern of the CoccineIlid<T by an
Hemipterous insect {Sterjcaiocerus mnltipimctatiis), while the appearance of many
S. African species of Lj/cidcP, light-brown anteriorly and black posteriorly, was
reproduced in beetles of many groups, many species of Hyraenoptera, an Hemi-
pteron, two moths from remote sections of the order, and a fly. In the vast
majority of these cases of likeness to and among Coleoptera, it is probable that the

resemblance is Miillerian (synaposematic) ratner than Batesian (pseudosematic).

The interpretation of the remarkable likeness borne by a species of Longicorn
{Phanfasia (jiganiea) for certain Curculionidce is more uncertain, although it is
clear that some general principle is at work, inasmuch as resemblances between

other species of the same groups are well known in many parts of the world. An

interesting group of superficially similar insects from three different orders con-
sisted of a IBracon, a Reduviid bug, and a Longicorn beetle.

     Evidence of the struggle for existence in Coleoptera was supplied by a group
of five beetles taken from the crop of a Guinea-fowl {Nuinida coroiinta). The
four species belonged to the Buprestids, Curculios, Longicorns, and Phytophaga.
All the beetles had been swallowed whole and were almost uuinj ured, even as
regards limbs and antennae.

    Among the ether orders of Insecta the Ilemiptera afforded a wonderful

example of mimicry or comm.on warning colours from Malvern, near Durban, the
Reduviid bug FJwnoctonus nigro-fasciatus bearing the most remarkable likeness to
the somewhat smaller Lygseid Dijsdercus supersfifiosus. The mimetic resem-

blance of Diptera to Aculeate Hymenoptera was illustrated by many examples,
model and mimic having been captured in the same place and within the same
month. The most remarkable of these was a splendid new species of Hyperechia,

closely resembling the black, reddish-brown banded, African species of Xylocopa,

such as A', flavo-vvfa. Instances of common warning (synaposematic) colours in
Hymenoptera were also illustrated by a group of three species with a general
resemblance to each other: the Aculeata being represented by a species of

Myzine and one of Ceropaleg, the Terebrantia by a species of Ichneumon, All
were captured at Salisbury in January 1899.

          By R. Shelford, B.A., Curator of the Sarawak M^lse^lm.

  [Arranged and communicated by Edward B. Poulton, M.A., F.H.S., Fellow of

        Jesus College, Oxford, and Hope Professor of Zoology in the University.]

     The following paper is an abstract of results obtained by ISIr. E.. Shelford,
B.A., Curator of the Sarawak Museum, British North Borneo. The vast majority
of his observations were made at or near Kuching, the capital of Sarawak ; a few,

however, in Singapore. When no locality is mentioned, Sarawak is to be under-

stood. The observations form a very important addition to our knowledge of
mimicry in Malayan insects, especially the Coleoptera.

    Among Lepidoptera an Elymnias, believed to be a new species from Blount

Penrissen, is a tolerable mimic of the well-known Eiiplwa, Tronr/a crmneri.

Among the Chalcosid moths, three species of Isbarta mimicked two of Eiipla:a and
796 REPORT-- 1900.

one of Piennce (Delias catharci). The latter is of considerable interest, inasmuch
as the Pierine model appears to be excessively rare. There can be little doubt,
however, as to the true relationship, for another species of the same genus,
/. pandemia, is a magnificent mimic of another species of Delias {D. pandemia),
both coming from Mount Kina Balu in North Borneo.

     In the Neuroptera the Mantispides are shown to be mimics, a splendid new
species {M. simulatri.v, McLachlau) resembling a common Bracon flying with it
on Mount Matang, near Kuching, while a small species from Singapore {M. ? cora)

exactly mimicked an ichneumon flying with it.
     It is in the Borneau Coieoptera, and especially the Longicornia, that by far

the largest additions to the subject of mimicry have been made. Many Longicorn

species, chiefly of the genus Oberea, were excellent mimics of the Braconidce,
and perhaps other Ilymenoptera. The long narrow form of the beetle resembled
the 5r«co?i at rest with wings folded. Asseenfromthe side, certain species of Oierea,

notwithstanding their uniform diameter, were apparently 'waisted' like a Hymeno-

pterous insect, the efi'ect being due to a conspicuous white patch on the side of the
anterior abdominal segments. The part of the body thus covered is obliterated, while
the outline of the patch is such that the uncovered, and therefore conspicuous, part
of the body conforms to the shape of a slender 'waist,' from the posterior end of
which the abdomen gradually swells. The effect in one species is as perfect as if
an artist had deliberately painted the profile of a Ilymenopterous abdomen upon

that of a beetle. Among other examples of the same form of mimicry was a

magnificent Oerambycid from Mount Penrissen ( Nothopeus or n. gen., n. sp.), a
beautiful mimic of the abundant vv'asp, Salius sericosoma, which flew with it.
The common Dammar Bee {Trigona apicalis), which does not sting, but is

formidable because of its bite, is the centre of a group of three species with the
most remote affinities. Not only is there a Longicorn, Epania siiigaporensis, but
a Bracon and a Reduviid bug. The mimicry is probably Miillerian in most, if not
all, of the species of this group.

      Another important set of Longicorns, species of Entelopes, Tropimetopa,
 0;-w?io;« ft, and J4«^«^/ie5, were extremely perfect mimicsofPhytophaga(G«/e?7<ci'£Z«).
In one large group both models and mimics were reddish-brown, in another

iridescent blue-black, in a third anteriorly blue-black, posteriorly reddish-brown.

Another species of Entelopes (E. glaucd) resembled a common Coccinellid {Caria

 dilatata), a Cassid also falling into the group.

     The Lycidce were models for Longicorns and other insects in Borneo no
less than in South Africa. Species belonging to the Longicorn genera Erythrtis,
Epldes, Xyaste, and Euri/cephalus mimicked Lycids with remarkable accuracy. In
(he last-named genus one species, jE. lundi, was a mimic, while another closely
related {E. cardinalis) exhibited a warning coloration of the most startling
character, an indication that the genus is distasteful and the mimicry Miillerian.
In addition to these, the Lycids were mimicked by a Clerid beetle, by numerous
Hemiptera and a Zygsenid moth, the latter from Singapore.

      The resemblance of certain Longicorns to the Rbynchophora was far more
evident than in South Africa, for not only was there a mimic ( Trachystola yramdata)
of a Curculionid (Sipalus granulatus), but there were species belonging to no less
than four genera mimetic of the Brenthida. These latter mimics hold their long
anteunre extended forwards side by side, the tips only, or in some species the
anterior halves, diverging. Thus the rostrum of the Brenthid, together with its
usually short antennae, are represented by the long antennse of the Longicorn.
The Anthribidce were mimicked by Longicorns of the genera Ereis and Cacia.

    A feature of both Ilhynchophorous models and their mimics, and one very

tmusual in mimicry, is the inconspicuous mottled colouring and the absence of

strongly contrasted tints.

    A very interesting Longicorn mimic of an Endomychid beetle {Spathomeles sp.

near turritus) was a rare species of Zelota as yet undescribed.. The curved
spine on the elytron of the model was represented by a brush of hairs on that
of its mimic. Experiments indicated that the Endomychida. as a group were
distasteful, and large synaposematic sets of purplish black, yello-\v or prftnge
                tRANSACflONS OP SECTION tt.                            797*

Spotted Species were found near Kucliing together -with several STpeciea of Erotylida
and a Pentatomid bug with the same general appearance. Another group of dark
Endomychids was rendered conspicuous by numerous spines (Ampkistermcs).

    Two groups of LoDgicorns were mimicked by other Longicorns belongino- to

entirely different sections. The iridescent green Cerambycidce of the genus
Chlori'dolum were closely resembled by two Lamiidce (Saperdi7ic8 ? genus, and
Chlorisanis viridis) and by the Cerambycid genera Xijstrocera, Psalanta, and

Lepturn. Many genera and species of the banded Cerambycid Clytince were

very closely mimicked by Lamiidce and other Cerambycidce. This last case is of
peculiar interest, inasmuch as the Clytince are themselves perhaps the most con-
spicuous mimics of Hymenoptera to be found in the whole of the Longicornia.

All over the world their numerous species commonly present a black yellow-

banded appearance bearing a general resemblance to wasps, while mimicry of

Mutillidcc, Cicindelida, and, in the allied Tillomoyphince, of ants is also found.

When, therefore, we also find that this group itself furnishes numerous models to
other Longicorns, we are driven to conclude that it is in some way specially

defended, and that its resemblance to Hymenoptera is Miillerian rather than

Batesian.

     The mimetic resemblance to the aggressive and active Cicindelidce was very
marked, examples being afforded not only by Longicorn beetles of the genera
Sclethrus and Collyrodes, but also by a Dipterous insect found flying together with
its model (Collyris emaryijiata) on Mount Seramba, December 1898. This is the
first example of the mimetic resemblance of a fly to a tiger beetle. The remark-
able Ijocustid mimic Condylodera tricondyloides (or a closely allied species)
described by Professor Westwood from Java was also rediscovered in Borneo, and

its habits for the first time observed.

Indirect evidence that the mimicry of Cleridce is Miillerian rather than

Batesian is similar to that which pointed to the same conclusion in the Longicorn

Clytince. One Bornean species of a Clerid genus (Thcmasimus) resembled a

Mutillid, another (genus near Tenerus) a Lycid, while a third, a species of Lemidia,

was mimicked by the Longicorn Daphisia puhhella.

 Among     the  Diptera a splendid  black  Hyperechia  (H. /era)  was  a beautiful

_

mimic of the abundant Xylocopa latipes, another example of parallelism with South
AnAfrican bionomics.
                      allied species, Laphria sp. near Terminalis, was an

excellent mimic of Salius aurosericeus. Dipterous mimics of tlymenoptera are

extremely abundant in Borneo: remarkable among them was a species which

mimicked an ichneumon of the genus Mesosternus. The short antonnje of the
fly in no way resembled the very long black and white ones of the ichneumon.

The fly, however, held up its black and white legs, applying their bases to its

head and moving them so that they closely resembled the antennte of the

Hymenopterous insect in movement as well as in colouring and proportions.

Another species of fly possessed true antennae which were remarkably long for

this order, and thus closely resembled those of an ichneumon.

With few exceptions, the whole of the material here briefly described may be

seen in the Hope Department of Zoology, Oxford University Museum.

7. The Locust Plague and its Suppression. By M. MunRo, M.D.

Locusts Lave devastated the greater part of the habitable world, and during

the last ten years have done great damage in the southern republics of South

--America, in North and South Africa, in India, &c.-- countries widely separated

from each other and they have caused great loss of human and anfmal life in

large areas in Africa belonging to Britain. The importance of the subject is
therefore considerable. But the difficulties which hitherto have been connected

with the plague seemed excessive and insuperable barriers in dealing with it

eH'ectually.

To illustrate the remarks in this paper I select the four following typical and

well-Iinown species of the insect, namely, 1, the Caloptenus spretus, or Roclvv

Mountain locust ; 2, the Stauronotus criatus, or Cyprian locust ; 3, the

>Sc/iistocerca  paranensis                                                     and 4, the  Acridium perenrinum, or  Old  World  locust,
                                                                            ;

in order to emphasise in a more pointed way certain aspects or characteristics of

the insect which I think it well to put prominently forward in attempting to bring

this plague under review, and askirg favourable attention as to the best means to

check it and alleviate the distress.

     a. Our increased and gradually accumulating knowledge of the habits of the

insects is derived mainly while the insects come to and snjourn in their temporary
homes, for we do rot yet know them in their permanent or true homes." The

one and only success in combating the plague by human means in the whole
history of the world was due to the putting in force the simple observation that the

young (or the old) locusts cannot adhere to smooth surfaces, such as glass, owing to

the fact which is now made abundantly clear, name!}', that, unlike Hies, the pro-

cesses or claws on the feet of their front and middle pair of legs are too short and
weak to enable them to do this.

     h. The general and characteristic features of the locust run through all the
.species alike. This fact has been greatly lost sight of or minimised, and the dif-
ferentiations which help to mark off one species from another have been magnified
into an unjustifiable and unnecessary importance. The instincts and the structure

of all the varieties are very nearly alike, although one species may not be so larga

or have different markings as compared with anotlier.

c. The direction which the ' army ' assumes when the Larvre at a certain

period set out for and continue on their ' march ' is a most important matter to

settle and be certain about, as this is the most destructive period in the life of the

insect. They then devour everything that comes in their way. Not so with the

Hight of flying locusts, which only levy toll here and there as they pass or sojourn.
The ' army on the march ' usually pursue a straight given course, irrespective of all

obstacles and dangers (natural or artificial) that may be in their way, minus any

with smooth surfaces owing to tlie reason above stated. Now the course or

direction  of the  '  march                                                    will  be  found  (though  further observation is requisite  to
                                                          '

confirm the truth fully) to be always in a given direction in certain countries.

Thus in the Argentine and South Africa they travel southwards, in Algeria north-

wards, in the United States eastwards, and so on. It may not be true south, or true

north, or true east in the respective instances mentioned, but it will be respectively

toicards the south, north, or east, as the case may be. The important thing to bear
in mind h that they all march in one general direction as a body at the same time,

and without any leader ; while so far as suitability and abundancs of food are con-

cerned to satisfy all their instincts an exactly opposite or other direction would be

far better. The ' Screen and Trap ' or ' Cypriote ' system was based on the suppo-

sition that the insects march in a given specific direction. It has been owing to this

fact that the power of the plague was iDroken in the course of one year (1883) in

Cyprus, although it baffled all efforts to check it for centuries before. Since the

suppression of the plague, and no doubt very much on account of it, Cyprus has

entered on a new era of prosperity.

              Outline of the Means for Checking or Suppi-essinff the Plagve,

    There is a sense in which a plague or pest such as that of locusts may be re-

garded as the increase over the natural checks with regard to the normal number.
                                                                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                                                                               799

When this gain takes place it is now almost universally admitted that human

measures ought to be resorted to with the view of aiding the natural agencies, so

that the insects may be reduced in number to a point that is safe or free from

danger.

                     Section E.--GEOGRAPHY.

--President of the Section Sir George S. Robertson, K.C.S.I,

                 THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.

The President delivered the following Address :

When the British Association for the Advancement of Science honoured me with

an invitation to preside over this Section, I accepted the distinction, thoughtfully

and with sincere gratification. The selection as your President at Bradford,

this great and interesting centre of commercial energy, of a student of political

movements who was also deeply interested in the science of geography, seemed to

point suggestively to a particular branch of our subject as appropriate for an

opening address. This consideration, and, to my thinking, the fitness of the

occasion, led me to believe that the British Empire itself was a very proper

subject for such reflections as could be compressed within the limits of an in-

augural Presidential Address. Many of my predecessors have eloquently and

--wisely dealt with various topics of admitted geographical rectitude with

geography in its more strictly scientific study, with its nature and its purview,

with its recent progress, and with the all-important question of how it could
be best taught methodically, and how most profitably it might be studied. In

-- --dealing with the important practical application of our science to the facts of

national life Political geo.'raphy I feel that perhaps a word of explanation

is necessary. Pure geography, with its placid aloofness and its far-stretching

outlook, combined sometimes with a too rigid devotion to the facts and con-

--clusions of strict geographical research, is apt to incline many scientific minds

to an admirable quiet-eyed cosmopolitanism the cosmopolitanism of the cloistered

college or the lecture tlieatre. It perhaps also at times has a tendency to create

in purely academic students a feeling of half disdain or of amicable irritability

against those who love the science for its political and social suggestiveness and

elucidations. Thus there is a possible danger that geographers of high intel-

lectual calibre, with enthusiasms entirely scholarly, may come to underrate

nationality and to look upon the world and mankind as the units, and upon

people and confederacies and amalgamations merely as specific instances of the

Wegeneral type.  know that geography is often looked upon as the science

of foreign countries more especially. Such mental confusion is undoubtedly

less common than it was, yet it still influences, unconsciously, the minds of

many people. It is well not to forget this curious fact, and to point out, as

if it required emphasising, that there is nothing foreign to geographical thought

in the association of geography and patriotism, and that the home country is

worthy of careful study, particularly when, as with us, our home country is not

Yorkshire, nor England, nor the United Kingdom, but the whole British Empire.

That is my justification and my apology for taking Political Geography and the
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                                801

British Empire as my subject, if justiBcation and apology seem to any one to he

necessary. To the i^enerous hearts of our distinguished foreign visitors who honour

us quite as much as they delight us by their presence, I am sure of my appeal.
Every true man loves his own country the best in the world. That beautifyino'

love of country does not require him to be ignorant of or to hate other countVies".

The community of the civilised nations, no longer to be described as Christendom

even, for Japan has been received into it, is a mighty fact in geography no less
than in politics. To love mankind one must begin by loving individuals ; before

attaining to true cosmopolitanism one must first be patriotic.

Now, besides dealing with the topography of the globe, geography considers also

the collective distribution of all animal, vegetable, and mineral productions which are
found upon its surface. The aspect of the science which deals with man's environ-

ment, and with those influences which mould his national character and compel

his social as well as his political organisation, is profoundly interesting intrinsically

and of enormous practical usefulness when rightly applied. Given the minute

topography of a country, a complete description of its surface features, its rivers,

mountains, plains, and boundaries, a full account of its vegetable and mineral

resources, a knowledge of its climatic variations, we have at once disclosed to us
the scene where we may study with something like clearness man's procession

through the ages. Many of the secrets of human action in the past are explained

by the laud-forms of the globe, while existing social conditions and social organisa-

tions can often thereby be intelligently examined and understood. Persistent

national characteristics are often easy to explain from such considerations. For

instance, the doggedness of the Dutch river-population, caused verv greatly by a

perpetual struggle against the sea, or the commercial carrier-instinct of the Nor-

wegians, those northern folk born in a country which is all sea-coast of countless

indentations. Having few products to barter, the Norwegians hire themselves
Weto transport the merchandise of other peoples.
                                                  British also vs-ere obviously pre-

destined to isolation and insularity, when perhaps in the human period the Thames

ceased to be a tributary of the Rhine. Our Irish fellow-countrymen were similarly

fated for all time to lead a separate, special, and national life apart from our own,

when at a still earlier period, geologically, the Irish Channel was formed.

     Such large-scale facts are not to be overlooked ; there are others, however, of
varying degrees of prominence. Some merely require to be interpreted thought-

fully, while others, after diligent study, may still remain dubious and matter" for

speculation. Geography is the true basis of historical investigation and the

elucidation of contemporary movements. At the present time great social and

--political changes are occurring throughout the world in Europe, Asia, Africa, and

America, and in the islands of the great seas. These changes are absolutely

dependent upon the physical peculiarities of the different lands actinsr upon

generations of men during a prolonged period of time. As a consequence of

certain soils, geographical characteristics, and climates, we notice how harsh

surroundings have disciplined some races to hardiness and strenuous industry,

accompanied by keen commercial activity, which is itself both a result of in-

creasing population and the cause of still greater overcrowdino-. Then we see

other people at first sight more happily circumstanced. With them the struggle

to live is less ferocious, their food is found with little toil. But we perceive that

the outcome of generations of Nature's favouritism has been to leave them less

forceful and less ingenious in the never-ending warfare of existence. By com-

parison they grow feeble of defence against the hungrier nations, ravenous for

provender. Man for ever preys upon his own kind, and an easy life in bland

surroundings induces a flabbiness which is powerless against the iron training of

harsh latitudes, or against the fierce energy and the virile strength produced by

hereditary wrestling with unkindly ground.

Governments, separated by vast ocean-spaces from their offshoots, has given origin
to new and distinct nations difi'erent from the parent stock in modes of thought

and in ways of life, a result due mainly, no doubt, to local physical conditions,
but in part also, if only in part, to detachment, to complete and actual severance
from the mother country. This brings us to that most interesting and important
topic, geographically speaking, of Distance, an aspect of our science which is of
the utmost concern to traders and to statesmen ; indeed, an eminent German
geoo-rapher defines geography as the Science of Distances. To this subject of

Distance I wish in particular to direct your attention, and especially to its

bearings upon the British Empire.

     The British Empire is equal in size to four Europes, while its population

approximates four hundred millions. Although that may seem a somewhat

--grandiloquent method of description, it is a fairly accurate statement of fact. Still

more interesting to us is another truth that outside of these islands we have

some ten millions of white-skinned English-speaking fellow-subjects. These
islands are scarcely more than one-hundredth part of the whole Empire, although

we count as four-iifths of its white population ; of the total number of the Queen's

subjects we are, however, no more than a tenth.

     British Empire is somewhat of a misnomer, just as the North American and

Australian Colonies were never colonies at all in the classical sense of the word.

For the colonies are not independent of the mother country. An empire again

really means a number of subject peoples brought together, and at first held to-
gether, by force. India is an empire for instance. Some new title or phrasft

would have to be invented to describe accurately all the possessions of the British

Crown from the Government of India through all possible grades of more or less
direct control until we come to some colony with representative institutions, and

thence to the great commonwealths with responsible legislators and responsible
cabinets. Happily, however, there is no need now for any novel designation.

The style British Empire has become in time of stress a rallying cry for all the
Queen's subjects, and the term has been sanctified by the noble eager devotion

shown to her Majesty, both as a beloved and venerated constitutional sovereign,

and as the common bond of unity between those great self-governing daughter-
nations which we in the past were accustomed to speak of as ' our colonies.'

Consequently British Empire has henceforward a clearly defined, a distinct, a national

sio-nificance, just as Imperialism has a special and peculiar meaning to all ofns.
"VVe understand by British Empire and by British Imperialism a confederacy of many

--lands under the rule of her Britannic Majesty. This confederacy is dominated by

white peoples Anglo-Saxons, Celts, French-Canadians, and others-- knit together

in most instances by the ties of blood relationship, but with equal if not greater

closeness by common interests, an identical civilisation, and a love of liberty, in

Weaddition to that dignified but enthusiastic acceptance, already referred to, of the
constitutional sovereignty of the same Queen.  may hope that generous demo-

cratic expansiveness and social assimilation will also in time detain willingly within

the limits of this British confederacy of white peoples those other Christians and

distant kinsfolk of ours in South Africa who are at present so bitterly antagonistic.

Kuled and controlled under liberal ideals by the centre of authority there are,

in addition, the great subject territories whose non-Christian population are less
advanced in moral and material progress. They exhibit indeed every degree of

backwarduess, from the barbarism of the savagest tribesman to the intellectual but

archaic civilisation of ancient Asiatic nationalities.

     Concerning the British Empire, and comparing it with other empires, ancient,
recent or now existing, its two most remarkable features are its prodigious and

lonsr-continued growth and the persistency of its power. It cannot to all seeming

grow much larger, from lack of expansive possibility. But it is unprofitable to
predict. Every step which has been taken in the way of extension, particularly

of late years, has been against the wishes and in almost passionate opposition to

the views of large sections of the people. Yet the process of enlargement has
gone on continually, being often in actual despite of a Government, whose
members find themselves powerless to prevent absorptions and concretions which
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                     803

tliey would gladly avoid. Objections to this perpetual growth of empire in

territory, and to the resulting responsibility which we not altogether willingly

accept, are unanswerable theoretically. The too heavy and continually increasing
strain upon our military resources every one can appreciate. The limit in power

of the strongest navy in the world is at least as obvious as the vital necessity

that our Navy be largely and ungrudgingly strengthened. Naturally the cry of

--cautious patriotic men is the same now that it has always been ' Consolidate

before you step farther.' In India, owing to conscientious and strenuous opposi-

tion to every suggestion of expansion and to the almost violent form which that

opposition often took, our progress has been on the whole slow and comparatively

Wesafe.  have (I, of course, avoid all allusion to very recent policy) as a rule

consolidated, strengthened ourselves, and made our ground sure before another
advance. But there is a general impression that in other parts of tlie world we
have been hastily and unfortunately acquisitive, whether we could help it or not
that the new provinces, districts, and protectorates are some of them weak to

fluidity ; that the great and unprecedented growth of the Empire has led to a

stretching and thinning of its holding links which are overstrained by the weight

of unwieldy extension and far beyond the help of a protecting hand. I hope to

be able to show that in some important respects this suspicion is not altogether
true ; that science, human ingenuity, and racial energy have given us some com-
pensations, and that it is not paradoxical nor incorrect to say that our recent

--enormous growth of empire has been everywhere accompanied by a remarkable

shrinkage of distances by quicker and closer intercommunication of all its parts
one with another and witli the heart centre. In short, the British Empire, in

spite of its seemingly reckless outspread, its sometimes cloudy boundaries, its
almost vague and apparently meaningless growth, is at the present day more

braced together, more manageable, and more vigorous as a complete organisation

than it was sixty years ago. The difference between its actual extent in the last

year of the century and its size at the date of the Queen's accession can be

estimated by a glance at a remarkable series of maps published in the ' Statesman's

Year-book for 1897,' while since 1897, and at this instant as we all know Well,

its-mighty bulk is being still further increased.

The world as a whole has strangely contracted owing to a bewildering increase

in lines of communication, to our more detailed geographical knowledge, to the

formation of new harbours, the extension of railways, the increased speed and the

increased number of steamships, and the greatly augmented carrying power of

great sailing vessels built of steel. Then, hardly second in importance to these

influences are the great laud lines and the sea-cables, the postal improvements, the

telephones and, perhaps we may soon add, the proved commercial utility of wireless

telegraphy. This universal time-diminution in verbal and personal contact has

brought the colonies, our dependencies, protectorates, and our dependencies of

dependencies, closer to each other and all of them nearer still to us. Measured bj^

time-distance, which is the controller of the merchant and the cabinet minister

just as much as of the soldier, the world has indeed wonderfullv contracted, and

with this lessening the dominions of the Queen have been rapidly consolidating.

Nor is this powerful influence by any means exhausted. In the near future we
may anticipate equally remarkable improvements of a like kind, especially in

railwayf, telegraph lines and deep-sea cables, and in other scientific discoveries for

transmitting man's messages through water, in the air, or perhaps by the vibra-
tions of the earth. For us particularly, railway schemes of expansion must be

mainly lelied upon to open up and to connect distant parts of the Empire. Our

true and only trustworthy road of intercommunication between the heart of the
Empire and its limits must always be the sea. For general trade purposes, such

as the convenience of busine.ss travellers, all continental lines and all the great

projected railways will be helpful, whatever nation controls them ; but our certain
security is the sea, the sea which protects us, which has taught us to be an

Imperial people, if we ever forget that, there may be a calamitous awakening.

-- --VVe must not be persuaded to build or at any rate to place reliance upon land

roadb or railways through regions inhabited by tribes and peoples over whom we

have not complete military as well as political control. Persian, Arabian, North

African railway projects are happily rarely heard of now. As national enter-

prises they never were and never could be practicable, or otherwise than dangerous
Wemistakes.
             are a world-power solely because of our worship and because of

our command of the sea. In the future also we shall remain a world-power only

so long as we hold command of the sea in the fullest sense of the term, not merely

by the force and efficiency of the fighting navy, but by the excellence and the

perfecting of our mercantile marine, by increasing its magnitude, carrying power,

Weand speed, and by anxiously attending to its recruitment by British sailors.

must not attempt to overtax our resources to guard railway "lines through foreign

Asemi-ciyilised or savage countries by exported or local armies.  heavy land

responsibility lies upon us already. Under a little more we might be easily over-
Weweighted and crushed down.
                              must concentrate all our surplus energies upon

our sea communications. Therefore the railway lines which I spoke of as helping

to consolidate the Empire in the near future are those only which are projected or

are being built in the various colonies and dependencies, lines to distribute and

collect, to connect provinces, and feed harbours. The mighty Canadian Pacific

Railway is unique in the Empire. It not only complies with all these require-

ments, but in addition it provides to Australia and the Eastern dependencies an

alternative road, convenient and safe. As I said before, all railways, wherever

built, will probably help us directly or indirectly in the long run, provided we
are never committed to the protection of any one of them outside of our own

boundaries.

     And what has been said about railways applies, with obvious modifications, to

telegraph lines and to maritime cables. "The more general the extension of these,
and the more numerous they become, the greater benefit will there be to this
country iii its double capacity as the greatest trader and the greatest carrier of
merchandise in the world ; while the actual equivalent to a diminution of time-

distance in travelling is to be found in the instantaneous verbal message which can

be despatched to the most distant point of the Empire. But we ought certainly to
join all the shores of the Queen's dominions by sea-cables completely controlled by
British authority. To rely upon connection between our own cables through

telegraph systems stretching across foeign countries, however friendly, or to
permit the ends of these sentient nerves of the Empire to emerge upon shores
which might possibly become an enemy's country, is dangerous to the point of

recklessness, that parent of disaster. As a melancholy instance of my meaning

it is only necessary for us to remember the Pekiu catastrophe--how we sufiered
from tliose dreadful intervals of dead silence, when we could not even communi-
cate directly with our own naval officers at Taku, or with any one beyond Shanghai,
although we have in our possession a place of arms at Wei-hai-Wei upon the Gulf
of Pechili. It is obvious that we ought to have an all-British cable for pure

strategic reasons as far as Wei-hai-Wei, our permanent military outpost on the
mainland.

    Now to give some suggestion of the increased facilities for carrying mer-

chandise, for conveying passengers quickly about the world, and for the sending

--of messages to all parts of the earth, a few, a very few, salient facts may be

quoted about ships sailing ships and steam vessels--and about telegraphs and

cables.

In 1870 there were no more than ten British sailing ships which exceeded or

reached two thousand tons burden. In 1892 the yards on the Clyde alone launched

lorty-six steel sailing ships which averaged two thousand tons each. In 1895 the
number of large steel sailing ships being built in the United Kingdom was down

to twenty-three, and, speaking generally, it is inevitable that sailing vessels must
give way to ocean steamships for most "kinds of cargo--cattle, coals, wool, grain,

oil, and everything else.     ...

Now let us turn to the results in shortening journeys accomplished by the

progress made in the construction and in the driving machinery of steamships
withm the last forty years, which has especially been fruitful in such improve-
                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E,                                                                                  805

t)aring tbls century the six months' Toyage round the Cape to India became

a forty and then a thirty days' journey by what was known as the overland route
for mails and passengers through Egypt. By degrees it had become shorter still

by the railway extensions on the Continent and by the unbroken steamship passage

through the Suez Canal, until now the mails and hurrying travellers may reach

London  in  twelve  or  fourteen days  after leaving                     Bombay                                      and  the  great  liners
                                                                                                                  ;

of the P. & O. Company can arrive in the Thames eight days later. This famous

corporation, after her Majesty had been reigning nearly ten years, possessad only

Nowfourteen ships, with an aggregate of 14,G0U tuns.                     it owns a princely fleet

of fifty-three ocean steamers, with a total capacity of 142,320 tons. Practically

the voyage to India in her Majesty's reign has been diminished by one-half at

least.

Also since the Queen's accession the passage between the British Isles and the

Commonwealth of Australia has grown shorter, from the ninety days taken by the

sailing clippers to the fifty-three days occupied by Brunei's Great Britain. At

the present time it lasts from thirty to thirty-five days by the Suez Canal route,

while it has been finished in as little as twenty-eight days. Australia is conse-

quently only half as far  away, in time, as  it  was                     while, if                                   the Suez Canal were
                                                                      ;

closed for any reason, we have at our disposal, in addition to the Cape route with

its quick steamers, which is linked to us by the Pacific Ocean road, the splendid

service of that Empire-consolidator, the Canadian Pacific Railway.

The important part played by the Suez Canal in this connection will be discussed

a little later. Now I am merely indicating by a few well-known facts the

diminution of distance by the improvements which have been made in the ships

themselves and in their propelling machines.

Across the Atlantic the rapidity of travelling and the general average speed of all

cargo steamers have increased remarkably. Very interesting statistics on this point

were given to the British Association for the Advancement of Science last year, at
WeDover, by Sir William White in the Presidential Address of Section G.
                                                                                                                                      may

.say, without repeating details, that during the last half of the nineteenth century

the breadth of the Atlantic has practically been diminished one-half.

In 1857 the Union Company contracted to carry mails in thirty-seven days to

the Cape. Now the contract time is nineteen days. This again diminishes the

distance by one-half. As an instance of the remarkable change which has been made
in steamships within forty years, it may be mentioned that the first Norman of the
Union Company took forty-two days to reach the Cape, while the present Norman

has covered the journey in fourteen days twenty-one hours. I need not specify

particularly the equivalent acceleration of speed upon other great steamship lines.

All our sea distances have been shortened 50 to 60 per cent, in an identical way.

    It is not too bold to predict that the Atlantic, from Queenstown to New York,

--will, before long, be steamed in less than four days. The question has now

resolved itself simply into this will it pay shipowners to burn so much coal as to

Weensure these rushing journeys before a cheaper substitute for coal is found?

Imow that a torpedo-destroyer has been driven through the water at the rate of

forty-three miles an hour by the use of the turbo- motor instead of reciprocating

engines. Consequently an enormous increase in the present speed of the great

Atlantic liners is certain if the new system can be applied to large vessels. By

such very swift steamers, and by the example they will set to all estabhshed and

competing steamship companies, the journey to Canada and subsequently to all

other parts of the Empire will be continually quickened, until predictions which

would now sound extravagant will in a few years be simple everyday facts.

   We must turn next to the subject of telegraphic communication, especially as

it relates to the British Empire.
     The mazes of land-lines and of sea and ocean cables are too numerous and

intricate to be described in detail. Also the general effect of this means of bringing
distant peoples together, and its transcendent importance for political, strategic, and
trading purposes, need not be too much insisted upon in this place, so obvious
must they be to every one. Yet, great as has been its power and advantage in all of
those directions in the past, it is certain that still greater development and still

greater service to the world will follow in the future even from existing systems,

not to Speak of tlieir certain and enormous possibilities of growtli. In tte celerity

of the actual despatch of a message we need not ask for much improTement.

Lightning speed will be probably sufficient for our go-ahead children of the

twentieth century. But where we may expect and shall undoubtedly get

increased success is in multiplied facilities for sending telegrams all over the earth,

and in widening their usefulness and convenience to all ranks and sections of the

community. To obtain these necessary advantages there are two requisites

first a great and general cheapening of tariffs and, as a certain consequence of

such reduced charges, a duplication or even a quadrupling of many of the

present  cables to prevent blocking                                                                                                                           and, secondly, an indefinite extension  of botli
                                                                                                                                                           ;

lines and cables everywhere. Progress in submarine telegraphy undoubtedly means

a lessening in the price of service and a firmer control by the State, as an obvious

corollary to the large help to the companies already given by the general tax-

payer, quite as much as it means those scientific inventions and scientific discoveries

which the coming years have in store for us. At the present time the charges are

far too high, ridiculously so as regards India, and the use of the great cables is

therefore very often beyond the power of the small capitalist and the trader of the

middle sort. Yet certain and early news is of supreme importance to large

numbers of both classes. Its absence hampers or stops business, while its price is

too severe a tax upon average profits. This fact has led to the invention of

ingenious and elaborate codes. They might possibly have been devised in any

case ; but there is no doubt that messages by code would be certainly expanded

so as to prevent all possible ambiguity, if telegraphing to distant countries were not

so costly. The spreading of land-lines and sea-cables about the earth has gone on

rapidly since 1870 ; to the extent that those already completed would seem even to

be in advance of their requirement, if that requirement were to be measured by

their full employment. Nevertheless it is to be wished that new companies could

be formed and new lines laid down to excite competition and thereby to cheapen

rates ; or else that our Government should step in and regulate charges over

subsidised British lines. For the power of the great telegraph corporations, by

reason of their monetary resources, enables them to overcome ordinary rivalry and

Ato treat public opinion with indifference.                                                                                                                   general cheapening of rates has

constantly been followed by increased profits, earned by the resulting augmentation

of traffic, but it needs an enterprising directorate to face the necessary initial

expenditure, except under pressure. Boldness and foresight in finance are natu-

rally less prominent features in the management of the great telegraph companies

than contentment with a high rate of interest on invested capital. All their energy

and watchfulness are employed to crush competition rather than to extend their

activities indefinitely. Moreover, money-making is their business, not Imperial

statesmanship. If it were a question of the added security or the close coupling-

up of the Empire (which are probably synonymous) on the one hand and a loss of

profit (however splendid the dividends might still remain) on the other, we know

what would be the result of their deliberations.

Important as are the sea-cables for statesmen, for strategy, and for commerce,

they are or will be equally important socially to keep up intimacy and swift

intercourse between families half in Britain aud half in India for instance, or

between friends and relations in these Islands and in the great Colonies. They

might be made to give the sensation almost of actual contact, of holding the hand

of your friend, of speaking directly to his heart. It is this interchange of per-

sonal news and private wishes, quite as much as the profound political and com-

mercial aspects of lightning communication with all parts of the Empire, which

will bind the Empire in bonds stronger than steel, easy as affection, to hold it

together with unassailable power. Consequently the health and strength of the

Empire depend very greatly upon a cheapening of telegraph charges. Doubtless

a time will come when all our main cables of the first importance will be in the

hands of Government, when they will only touch upon British territory, and when

they will be all adequately protected from an enemy. Those are truly Im-

perialistic and patriotic aspirations. But we must never forget the grand part in

bringing together, within whispering distance as it were, the different parts of the

world, and consequently of our world-wide Empire, which has been taken in the
TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION E.                                          807

past by such Napoleonic organisers as the late Sir John Pender. It is to him and
to such men as he that we owe those splendid beginnings which by means of vital

reflexes from the nerve-centre of the Empire have helped to fire our white fellow-

subjects all over the globe with a loftier patriotism and with new, brave, and

broader ideals of nationality.

It was coincident with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 that the liveliest

interest began to be taken in sea-cables, and a master mind perceived their com-

mercial possibilities. Before that time the success of the constructing companies

bad not been great. Sir John Pender then founded the famous Eastern Telegraph

Company by the amalgamation of four existing lines, which had together laid

Adown 8,500 miles of sea-cables, besides erecting land-lines also.  year later, in

1873, from three other companies he formed the Eastern Extension Australasia

and China Telegraph Company, which jointly possessed 5,200 miles of submarine
lines. From that date the extension of electric communication to all parts of the

earth, over wild as well as over civilised countries, and beneath the salt water, has

only been equalled by their average remunerativeness. Now there are 175,000

miles of submerged cables alone, of which this country owns no less than

113,000 miles. The history of some of these cables is full of interest, and might

attract the delighted attention of the lover of picturesque romance no less than of

the student of commercial geography. It also supplies suggestions and many

facts, both to the physical geographer and to the student of seismic phenomena.

Science has taught the companies to economise time, labour, and material in cable-

laying operations, as well as how to improve the working instruments. Human

ingenuity, business perception, and organising power have shown once more their
startling possibilities when directed and controlled by cool, clear-eyed intelligence

combined with general mental capacity.

It is only necessary to reaffirm, for the reasons already given, the national, the

imperial, the commonwealth i-equirement for cheap telegraphy, and the profound

necessity there is both strategically and politically for complete government con-

trol by purchase, guarantee, or other equitable means over main cables which

connect Great Britain with her daughter states, her Indian empire, and her depen-

dencies. Our communications with our own folk must be independent of private

companies and completely independent of all foreign nations.

All the details which I have given are illustrative of man's successful energy

and of his progressive ingenuity in enslaving the great forces of the earth to

diminish distance, to shorten world-journeys, and to speed world-messages.

Another human achievement, the piercing by Lesseps of the Suez isthmus, has
bad remarkable consequences. It had been talked of in England centuries ago.
Christopher Marlowe makes Tamerlane brag :

· Anil here, not far from Alexandria,
 Whereas the Tyrrhene and the Red Sea meet.
 Being distant less than full a hundred leagues,
 I meant to cut a channel to them both

 That men might quickly sail to India.'

     The illustrious French engineer solved one great problem in 1869, only to

--originate others which are of profound importance to commercial geography and

to the British Empire most of all. The Suez Canal has brought India and the
Australasian Commonwealth wonderfully near to our shores. It has greatly

diminished many time-distances, but why has it not injured our Eastern trade ?
Also is there any danger or menace of danger to that trade ? From the very

beginnings of the great commerce, the Eastern trade has enriched every nation
which obtained its chief share. It has been the seed of the bitterest animosities,

It alienated Dutch and English, blood relations, co-religionists, co-reformers, into
implacable resentment, and bitter has the retribution been. On the other hand it
brought into temporary alliance such strange bedfellows as the Turks of the six-
teenth century and the Venetians. At the present day what intornationil jealousies
and heartburnings has the same rivalry not fostered ! For all the trading peoples

know how vital is that traffic.

     In the earliest days of commercial venturings the Eastern trade focuased at
808 KEPORT-- 1900.

Alexandria, afterwards at Constantinople and the Italian ' factory ' stations of the

Eastern Mediterranean. Barbarous upheavals in Central Asia interrupted the

current at times, but only as temporary dams. Then came Vasco da Gama's

--voyage round the Cape and its sequels the diversion of the rich merchandise of

the Orient from the Italian ports and from the Eastern Mediterranean to the sea-

coast cities of the Atlantic. Out of the relentless scramble of the Atlantic nations

for this, the grandest of the trader's prizes, the English came out bloodily trium-

phant, and the British have remained the dominant shippers ever since. But when

the Suez Canal was trenched through, a geographical reversal followed : the mer-

chant's chief path may be said to have left the Cape circuit and to have regained

the old line, with immensely added facilities, to debouch upon the Eastern

Mediterranean. "Why has it not a fleeted us more profoundly ? Are not geo-

graphical canons outraged by the great steamers passing by the French and Italian

ports to find distributing centres in these islands ? I think that theoretically it is

so, even admitting that the foreign harbours are more difficult than ours. Practi-

cally only a few industries have suffered ; the volume of our trade has increased

greatly, and it still remains easily pre-eminent. One of the chief explana-

tions  I  believe  to  be  this                      Geographical  considerations  were  defeated,  for  the
                                                  :

time at any rate, by the excellence of our bauliing system when the Suez Canal
was opened. The wealth of the country, then as now, instead of being separated and

divided into isolated patches, was accumulated in the hands of bankers and was

-- --readily and easily available for commercial enterprises. So the necessary steamers
   huge, and of special line were built at once by our companies and launched into

the valuable Eastern trade before their rivals could begin to stir. This country had

the invaluable help of its monetary facilities. Wealthy slaipping corporations, once

fully organised and successful, have great power, by reason of tbeir reserves and

resources, to hustle and to ride ofi" the attacks of weaker and less experienced

--competitors. Supposing this great change had but just occurred our advantages,

though still distinct, would have been less remarkable. And in the future inter-

Wenational trade jealousy will be keener and the competition even more severe.

must not forget that our geographical position is no longer in our favour for steam-

ships plying from the East, and, as in the immediate past, we must throw away no

chances, but seek to make up for that admitted defect by foresight, by education,

by maintaining and constantly adding to our experience, and by defending and

-- --supporting that admirable system our national banking system which has carried

us over seemingly insurmountable obstructions to brave trade triumphs.

The general considerations which I have named might lead to the inference

that actual geographical disadvantages, in trade competition for instance, may

sometimes be conquered by man's resourcefulness and energy. Within obvious

limitations that is certainly true. At places, as we know, the borderland between
geography and many of the natural sciences is often vague and confusedly inter-

laced. So perhaps also with mechanical and economic science our boundaries at

certain spots overlap.     Quick steamers, far-reaching telegraph lines, and the

piercing of isthmuses by ship-canals may at the first glance appear outside the

purview of the geographer. Yet from that particular aspect of geography which

I have already spoken of as the Science of Distances we perceive how relevant
they are, how worthy of study. Truly ours is a very catholic science, and we have
seen how even the comparative value of national banking systems may help to

explain seeming geographical inconsistencies, to reconcile facts with possibly un-

expected results, and to show how the human element modifies, perhaps", the

strictly logical conclusions of the geographer intent upon physical conditions

alone. It is for the statesman and the philosopher to speculate upon the character

and the permanency of such influences. Our success as an Empire will probably

depend for its continuance upon a high level of national sagacity, watchfulness,

and resource, to make up for certain disadvantages, as I think, of our geographical

position since the cutting of the Suez Canal ; and it will also depend upon the

comprehensive and intelligent study of all branches of geography, not the least

--important of which to my view is the Science of Distances the science of the mer-

chant, the statesman, and the strategist.
TRANSACTION'S OF SECTION E.  809

      The following Papers were read :

 1. AUempls to iinprove the Teaching of Geography in Elementary Schools,

            especially in the West Biding. By T. G. Roofer, If. M.I.

      IJeforms were begun through the Royal Geographical Society, whose collection
 of foreign maps was lent for exhibition in Bradford in the year 18S7. The display
 of maps, models, and various devices for illustrating the instruction in geography
 in the elementary schools of Germany, France, and Sweden attracted special
 attention. Conferences were held in connection with the exhibition, cue of which

 was attended by Dr. Scott Keltic, who made the collection.
      One immediate result of these proceedings was the commencement of a series

 of local maps and models, a collection of which is exhibited. The conferences
 discovered the chief defects in the existing instruction : (1) Lessons in geography
 were not based on object teaching, nor on the observation of local features and
 scenery. (2) The art of ' reading ' maps was not taught, nor was the construction
 of a map led up to by making plans of short walks and diagrams of the neighbour-
 liood. {?>) The study of political and commercial geography was not based upon
 the study of physical geography, neither were the details of geographical study
 connected as cause and eHect. There was no attempt to present a country to the
 scholar as a connected whole, and the lessons consisted of lists of names and
 figures, at the most arranged in groups. Of such details many were wholly un-

 suited to the elementary stage.

      The chief reforms consisted in the intelligent study of local geography through
 local maps and models, and in object lessons which explain the principles of
 physical geography. The reliefs and models led up to the art of reading maps
 and to the demand for better maps. Such lessons are an excellent introduction

 to reasoning, and prove how little there is that is purely arbitrary even in the
 sites of towns and villages in the neighbourhood, much less in the industries whicli

  are carried on in them.

      The necessity for good wall-maps is now apparent, and correctly drawn details
 are demanded in place of vague and inaccurate sketches. Maps must interpret
 nature, and map reading is the converse of the process of studying home geography.
 In studying home geography the child begins with a natural feature such as a
 river or hill, and learns how to represent it on paper. On the other hand, in

 reading a wall-map the scholar begins with the symbols or representations of
 natural features which he has not seen, and arrives by means of them at the
 natural facts which such symbols represent. Hence the extreme importance of

 the right study of home geography and local models and reliefs. The symbols on

 the wall-map are vague and meaningless unless a content and significance are
  given them by previous practice in the building up of local plans and maps. The

 scholar has to be taught with care how to translate the symbols of the wall-map
  back into the forms of nature which they, however inadequately, represent. The
 difference between a good and a bad map is now apparent. As the scholar com-

  mences geography by the study of nature in a triple process, which consists of
 observation, description, and representation, so, if the wall- map be accurate enough,
 he can continue to draw inferences from it much as though he were actually ob-

  serving the country by personal inspection.
       The value of graphic work in teaching geography is insisted on. The mere

  copying and colouring maps of various parts of the world is rather an exercise in
  drawing than in geography. Each map should be drawn to serve some definite
  purpose. It should disentangle from a complex whole some particular part which
  analysis brings to light, and illustrate it with precision and simplicity. Further,
  the aketch-maps should proceed from simpler studies to more complex, and no
  map should be made of a country as a whole until the leading features have been
  dealt with separately, and thus the 'constructive' method of teaching geography

  is introduced.

       The comparison of statistics of various kinds is made much more intelligible if

. the scholars learn to express their statistics by the use of square-ruled paper.

Abstract numbers are thus converted into concrete space forms, and are tben much
more comprehensible. In conclusion the formation of local geographical

societies for educational purposes is recommended, and an account is given of the
formation and working of the Southampton Geographical Society.

     The following Papers and Report were read :

                          1. The Treatment of Regional Geography.

                     By Hugh Robert Mill, D.Sc, LL.D.

     The author brought a scheme for a geographical description of the British
Islands, based on the 1-inch map of the Ordnance Survey, before the Section at the

Liverpool Meeting in 1896. He has since worked out the regional geography of the

area delineated in two sheets of the 1-inch map of South-west Sussex.^ The
extension to the whole country of work on an equally minute scale appears to be
rendered impracticable only by its cost and the indifference of the public to geo-
graphy. It is hoped, however, that the principles of regional description laid down
in the paper may be of service in promoting similar descriptions for other parts of

the countrv, whether carried out as part of a general scheme or independently.

     The configuration of the district as deduced from the 1-inch map is the first

condition in importance, and should be treated both generally, as to the main
features alone, and also specially, as to particular details which are of more imme-
diate interest than the rest. The distribution of rocks and superficial drift taken

from the geological map comes next in importance, and it is interesting, though not

essential, to trace the causal relation of geological structure and geographical form.
It is more important to indicate clearly the places where mineral products of

economic value occur. The next part of the description deals with what may be

called, in default of a better term, mobile distributions. These include all features

     ' As it would be obviously impossible to show more than a mere fraction of
the slides used (nearly 3,000 in all), a further and much larger selection was placed
in the Association's temporary museum.

relating to the surface which are modified in their distribution by the action of

fixed forms and particular rock- formations. They include clmiate, the character

of which depends greatly on altitude and on the direction of heights and valleys with

regard  to  the  prevailing  winds                                 water                          supply,                      including rainfall,  as   modified by the

altitude and exposure of slopes, percolation and the return of water to the surface

as springs (dependent on the geological nature of the ground), and the volume

and frequency of rivers, vcf/etation, animal life, population in all the distributional

details of birth- and death-rates, disease, migration, towns, villages, and connecting

roads and railways, agriculture, industries, and trade.

The particular case selected was a fairly representative one, and brought out

very clearly how all the conditions of human settlement and migration depended

ultimately in a more or less marked degree on the forms of the land. It became

very clear from such a study that geography rightly conceived was the science

which unified and made available for practical application the immense mass of

distributional statistics of all kinds which are brought together at great expense

by Government, but never coordinated or made available.

    Our Ordnance map is primarily a military map, made by soldiers for the use

of soldiers.

   A practical question :

      "What is the best form of map for the use of troops in standing camps in this

 How far do the maps supplied by the Ordnance Survey answer the above

     purpose ?

necessary, for carrying on military operations ?

        4. Journeys in Central Asia. By Captain Et. II. P. DeasV.

     Captain Deasy's paper deals with explorations in Western Tibet and Chinese
Turkestan, begun in 1S9G. The most important features of this explorer's work
are, first, the extensive use of triangulation for determining' longitudes from
peaks, fixed by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, and heights ; secondly,
the discovery of the sources of the Khotan River; and thirdly, the detailed survey
of that exceedingly difficult mountainous region, the hitherto unknown stretch of
the Yarkand River.

     The contiuued opposition of the Chinese added considerably to the physical
difficulties encountered, and resulted in the explorer and his assistant being
incapacitated from work by severe illnesses. The latter compelled Captain Deasy

to return to India much sooner than he had intended.
     It may be of interest to note that the heights of about 250 peaks were

determined, and over 40,000 square miles of country surveyed. Much valuable

assistance was rendered by the Indian Government, especially by the Surveyor-
General, and seTcral officers of the Foreign Department. Captain Deasy is very

grateful for this, as well as for the services of the native topographers, kindly lent

by Colonel Gore, R.E., now Surveyor-General of India.

5. Large Earthquakes recorded in 1899. By Johk Milne.

     In 1899 at Shide, in the Isle of Wight, 130 earthquakes were recorded. The
greater number of these were also observed at Ivew, whilst very many of them
were common to registers from Canada, the Cape of Good Hope, India, Java,
Japan, and other distant countries.

     Analysis of these records has increased our knowledge respecting the rates at
which motion is transmitted through our world, and indirectly thrown new light
upon its rigiditj^ The arcual velocity of surface waves has been investigated, and

new rules based on these investigations have been formulated for determining the

position of earthquake origins. It has, for example, been shown that the distance
of an origin from a given station can be determined either from the interval by
which the preliminary tremors outrace the larger surface waves or from the interval
between the arrivals of waves which had travelled from their origin round the
world in opposite directions.

     With this knowledge it is frequently possible for an observer in any part of the
world to name the district from which an earthquake recorded at his observatory

has originated.

     One series of observations showed that the amplitude of the large waves
of earthquakes decreased more rapidly when traversing suboceanic paths than
when they radiated over continental surfaces. In discussing the nature of
large waves this observation on the damping effect of oceans was used as an
argument that this form of seismic movement represented gravitational surface
waves rather than the outcrop of distortional waves propagated through the body

of the world.

     One hundred and twenty-five out of the 130 records considered represented
disturbances which had suboceanic origins. The principal of them may be grouped

as follows:

1. North-eastern Pacific, W. of British Columbia       14
2. East Mid Pacific, W. of Southern California          5
3. East Southern Pacific, W. of Peru and Chili          8

....4. West Pacific, ofE Japan                         19
                                                       12
5. West Mid Pacific, near Java
C. Mid Indian Ocean                                      9
                                                       17

    If we except the second group we see that the Pacific origins are on tbe face or

at the bottom of ' deeps,' which iorm portions of the trough or troughs around the
eastern and western margins of that ocean. If future soundings show that the
indicated exception is only apparent, then the second group will also illustrate the
rule that accelerations in secular adjustments of the earth's crust are most frequent

where this exhibits the greatest tlexure.
     Inasmuch as there are reasons for believing that each of these earthquakes was

accompanied by large meclianical displacements of solid materials, the import-

ance of localising the sites where such changes are frequent is evident to those who

select routes for deep-sea cables.

    Although we are not in a position to say that these displacements are suf-
ficiently large to produce a measurable effect on the moment of inertia of the
earth, attention may be directed to the fact that at those times when changes in
latitude have been marked large earthquakes have been frequent, whilst when

they have been few such changes have been less pronounced.
     Another subject of interest to those engaged in geodetic work is the fact that

changes in the rates of pendulum time-keepers may sometimes be traced to tbe

imfelt movements of large earthquakes, which so frequently disturb all countries in

tbe world.

4. The British Antarctic Expedition, 1899-1900. ^?/ C. E. Borchgrevink.

     Mr. Borchgrevink commenced with an account of the origin of the expedition
which he commanded, thus referring to his previous work within the Antarctic
Circle, and to the resolution which was carried at the Sixth International Geo-
graphical Congress at the Imperial Institute in 1895. The voyage of the
Southern Cross was shortly described with a few incidents ; the results of some
of the principal observations (both meteorological and magnetic), the landing, the

camp, and the work of the land expedition from March 1899 to March 1900. An

account of the principal discoveries made during one year on South Victorian
Land was given, with a description of the ice conditions, in winter and summer,
near Cape Adare and in the pack,

      VVhar the author claims as the principal work of the expedition is the
pioneer work in Victoria Land, extending over a period of one year, thus for
the first time proving the possibility for an expedition to live on South Victoria
Land in the winter, with the following results :

     1 Recording the meteorological and magnetic conditions at Cape Adare and at
various places on the ice and on the mainland between this locality and the
78th parallel, thus locating the present approximate position of the South Mag-
netic Pole, in latitude 7?>° 20' S. and longitude 146° E., about 220° west by north
from AVood Bay.

     2. Discovery of new species in antarctic biology, with special reference to the

shallow-water fauna and the flora of South Victoria Land, both proving
bi-polarity, and suggesting a theory for the distribution of organisms.

     3. Touching upon the importance of the discovery of insects as indicating an
average temperature in the neighbourhood of the locality where they were found,

not deviating much from what was experienced during the years 1899-1900.

      4. Furtliest south 78° 50'.

     The aulihor gave his views shortly in regard to further exploration within the

Antarctic Circle, as well iu regard to outfit aa in reference to desirable places for
landing.

 1. Some Consequences that may be anticipated from the Development of the
     Resources of Chi^ia by 3fodern Methods. By Geo. G. Chisholji

       M.A., B.Sc.

      Various causes are pointed out as already in operation tending to bring about
 that development in spite of the opposition of some sections of the people. " These

are of such a nature as to make it unlikely that this development, however brouo-ht

 about, will be long retarded.

     When it does come about this development isbouna to have world-wide effects

 on a scale of extraordinary magnitude, and in one direction it seems probable that
it will tend to reverse the tendency of the last generation in the economic history

 of the world.

      The peculiarity of the position of China is this, that it is the one reo-ion in the
world with all the means for industrial development on a gigantic scale that
remains to be opened up. In the past thirty or forty years we have chiefly seen
the opening up of new countries or old countries without great resources for

industrial development.

     Among the consequences that may be anticipated from this opening up are

these :

    A1. rise in prices in China, especially in the industrial regions.

     2. The creation of a demand for food-stuffs not likely to be supplied bv China
itself; a demand which in itself will be one of the most powerful causes" contri-

buting to maintain the rise in prices.
     3. The imparting of a great stimulus to the fond-producing regions most

favourably situated for meeting this demand, more particularly Manchuria, Siberia
and western North America, probably the Pacific States of North America to a
greater extent than Canada.

     4. Perhaps the most important of all, the creation of a tendency to a "radual
but prolonged rise in wheat and other grain prices all the world Over, reversin"-
the process that has been going on since about 1870 in consequence of the successive
Opening up of new countries.

                    2. The Commercial Resources of Tropical Africa.

                            By Edavard Heawood, M.A.

     At least 70 per cent, of the total trade of Africa falls to the countries of the
extreme north and south, leaving the whole of Tropical Africa, with an area of
some 9 millions of square miles, a total trade of at most 30,000.000^., of which
nearly 7,000,000/. belongs to the small islands of Mauritius and Reunion. The
object of the present paper is to examine the cauaes of this small commercial

movement as compared with that of other tropical countries, and to form some

conclusion as to the permanence, or the reverse, of present conditions.

     Among historical reasons for the smallness of the existing trade are (1) the

attraction exercised during the age of great discoveries by America and the East

and  the consequent                                           neglect of   Africa                                      (2)  the  political  condition of                                                                                  the African
                                                                                                               ;

peoples ; (3) tbe effects of the slave trade ; whil-' geographical causes are found

in (1) the massive form of the continent and consequent absence of natural means
of communication ; (2) the unhealthiness of the coastlands. That many of these

causes are not necessarily permanent is shown by a comparison with Brazil, which
affords a close parallel with Tropical Africa in many respects. This shows that,

given natural resources capable of supporting an increased export trade, the com-

mercial future of Tropical Africa need not be hopeless.

    The resources of a new country may be classed as (1) exhaustible, principally

minerals                                          (2)  permanent, chiefly animal and vegetable products, the second group

being the more important. It may be again subdivided into (1) jungle products,

which,  though                                         not    necessarily  exhaustible,                                     are  likely to                                                                                    siiH'er  diminution                                                        (2)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

cultivated products. The former may, under cultivation, be transferred to the

latter sub-group, which is the most important of all. In Brazil, e.g., the vast

preponderance of the exports is made up by the four products coffee, cacao,

tobacco and cotton. Which, with rubber, maiie up the principal resources of the

countrv. In Tropical Africa jungle products, principally rubber and palm-oil

and kernels (total annual value over 4,000,000/.), are at present those on which
Athe export trade mainly depends.
                                                                                                                       period of development of plantation pro-

ducts has, however, set in, and coffee, cacao, cotton, tea, &c., have been grown

with success in various parts. The chief difficulties to be encountered arise from

(1)  want                                         of   means  of  transport                                       (2)  scarcity of labour                                                                                     but  these  are now in a

fair way to be overcome. The modern tendency for each country to depend for

tropical produce largely on its own colonies must favour the commercial develop-

ment of Africa, while the comparatively low population of Africa per square mile

renders it probable that it will in the future play an important part in providing a

food supply for the more thickly peopled continents.

                                  3. On Snow Ripples.
                 By Yaughan Cornish, M.Sc, F.C.S., F.R.G.S.

    These observations, made in Scotland last winter, are preliminary to a general
investigation of the surface forms of snow, which the author proposes to continue
in a colder climate during the coming winter. The investigation is undertaken in
connection with the author's research upon terrestrial waves and wave-like sur-

faces.

     The general conditions during the following observations are : ground already
covered with snow, temperature a little below the freezing point.

   --Case I. Snow falling sparsely. In absence of wind the surface was uneven,

owing to clinging together of flakes. In a light breeze there was a notable
tendency for the prominent parts to arrange themselves transversely in ridges, the

distance from ridge to ridge not more than one inch. When the breeze freshened

these became regular ripples, with a smoothed surface of closer texture. One set of
measurements gave the distance between successive ridges, 1125, 1'225,0'85, 1"05,.
and I'OO inch. Their amplitude was approximatslj -05 inch, which gives a ratio
Length : Height = 21 approximately. The steep face of these ripples is on the
windward side, whereas in sand ripples and water waves the steep face is on the
sheltered side. The normal movement is downwind, the most noticeable feature
of the pi'ocess being the retreat of the steep weather face, consequent upon the
abrasion of its surface. For occasional short intervals, however, during lulls and
during moments of heavier snowfall, the ripple.5 rush upwind, owing to the sudden
deposit of snow upon each weather face.

   --Case II. Frosh breeze without snowfall, blowing upon uncompacted snow.

The surface was beautifully covered by ripples of '6 inches to 15 inches from ridge
                       TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION E.                     817

to rld^e, -which were rapidly iucreasin<r in size. The steep side faced the wind.
The ridges, which were pretty accurately parallel one to another, were transverse
to the wind, but with much sinuosity, no ridge being straight for more than a few

inches. It is evident that the wind must be concentrated in the re-entrant angles

of the steep weather slope, and this would tend by rapid erosion to destroy the

arrangement of long transverse lines which is the most obvious characteristic of
ripples. The ridges, however, did not lose their transversality, which was

apparently preserved by the greater deposit of drifting snow in these re-entrants,
which stopped the threatened gaps; and by the collapse of the overhangmg

cornice of uncompacted snow at the salient angles, bv which these promontories
were truncated.

   --Case III. The latest-fallen layers of snow having been blown away, the wind

acts upon compacted snow (this was generally in drifts which had become exposed
owing to change of direction of wind). The wind abraded a fine granular ' drift,'
which did not adhere to the smooth hard surfaces. Parallel lines of bevelling or

grooving transverse to the wind are the most conspicuous feature of the resulting

structure in the compact, almost homogeneous, fine-grained material. The
lines are much freer from minor irregularities than the ripples described above.
As the action continues, however, the sinuosities are emphasised, for, the ' drift'

not adhering well, the re-entrants are cut back more and more behind the
salients. Further, the wind concentrating along the lines of the re-entrants, the

general level of the surface here is lowered more quickly by abrasion than is the
case along the intermediate lines of the salient angles. Thus is produced a well-
marked form transitional between snow ripples and sastrugi, in which inter-
mediate form the transverse ridges are crossed at right angles by alternate rido-es

--and furrows parallel to the wind, the furrows being along the line of the re-entrants.
     Sastrugi. This action went on until the ridges transverse to the wind were
merely a subordinate and scarcely noticeable feature, and the snow was seen to be
in great ridges parallel to the wind. These corresponded perfectly with the
sastrugi of the Tundras as described by A. Penck ' on the authority of F. Schmidt
and G. Bore.

     On the opposite orientation of snow ripples and sand n>;>/^s.--Eipples in loose
sand have their steep faces on the leeward, snow ripples on the windward side.
The exposed face of the snow ripple becomes steeper than the sheltered face*
because the cohesiveness of the snow while in mass enables the wind to carve out
wind caves, in which its force is concentrated. In loose sand the slipping of the
material prevents this. The friability of the snow also assists in the effect, the

detailed explanation of which would, however, be too long for this abstract.

    Observations were also made upon the forms of snowdrifts.

     Photographs were taken of ripples, sastrugi, and drifts.

       4. The Geographical Distribution of Relative Humidity.
                               ByYi.G. Ravenstein.

The author stated that the importance of relative humidify as a climatic factor
was fully recognised. Having illustrated its influence upon organic life, upon
agriculture and human industries, he expressed his regret that neither in number nor
in trustworthiness did humidity observations meet the requirements of a person
desirous of illustrating its distribution over the globe by means of a map. This was
owing largely to defects in the instruments employed, incompetence of the observers
and unsuitabUity of the hours chosen for the observations. As to the humidity over
the ocean, we were still dependent upon the observations made onboard passing
vessels, and he was afraid that the time had not yet come when floatincr meteoro-
logical observatories

subject liad not been lost sight of by him since then, and he now placed the results
befofd this meeting. He did so with some diffidence, and over-cautious meteoro-
logists might condemn his action, but they must remember that when Berghaus, in
1833, acting upon suggestions made by Zimmermann and Humboldt, published the
lir,-t isothermal chart the observations on temperature were even less numerous
than those on humidity were at present. His charts, of course, must be looked
upon as sketches, but he felt confiient that they brought out the broad features of

the subject, and to reduce the sources of error he had limited himself to indicating
four o-rades of mean annual humidity, the upper limits of which were respectively
50 per cent, (very dry), 65 per cent., 80 per cent., and 100 per cent, (very
damp). The relative humidity over the oceans might exceed 8(5 per cent., but
in certain regions (' horse latitudes') it was certainly much less, and in a portion of
the Southern Pacific it seemed not to exceed 65 per cent., a feature seemingly con-
lirmed by the salinity of that portion of the ocean, which exceeded 3'6 per cent.

     Ills second chart exhibited the Annual Range of Humidity, viz. the difference
between the driest and the dampest months of the year. In Britain, as in many
other parts of the world, where the moderating influence of the ocean was allowed

free scope, this difference did not exceed IG per cent., but in the interior of

the continents it occasionally exceeded 45 per cent., spring or summer being
exceedin"-ly dry, whilst the winter was excessively damp, as at Yarkand, where a
humidity of 30 per cent, in May contrasted strikingly with a humidity of 84

per cent. In December.
      This great range directed attention to the influence of temperature (and of alti-

tude) upon the amount of relative humidity, for during temperate weather we were

able to bear a great humidity with equanimity, whilst the same degree of humidity,
accompanied by great heat, such as is occasionally experienced during the ' heat

terms' of New York and recently in London, may prove disastrous to men

and beasts. Hence, combining humidity and temperature, the author suggested
mapping out the earth accordiog to sixteen hijgrothermal types, as follows :

     1. Hot (temperature 73° and over) and very damp (humidity 81 per cent, or
more) : Batavia, Camaroons, Mombasa.

     2. Hot and moderately damp (66-80 per cent.) : Havana, Calcutta.
     3. Hot and dry (51-65 per cent.) : Bagdad, Lahore, Khartum.
     4. Hot and very dry (50 per cent, or less) : Disa, VVadi Haifa, Kuka.
    5. Warm (temperature 58° to 72°) and very damp : Walvisch Bay, Arica.
    6. Warm and moderately damp : Lisbon, Rome, Damascus, Tokio, New Orleans.

     7. Warm and dry : Cairo, Algiers, Kimberley.
    8. Warm and very dry : Mexico, Teheran.

     9. Cool (temperature 33° to 57°) and very damp : Greenwich, Cochabambo.
     10. Cool and moderately damp : Vienna, Melbourne, Toronto, Chicago.

      11. Cool and dry: Tashkent, Simla, Cheyenne.
      12. Cool and very dry : Yarkand, Denver.

     13. Cold (temperature 32° or less) and very damp : Ben Nevis, Sagastyr, Godt-

 haab.

     14. Cold and moderately damp : Tomsk, Pike's Peak, Polaris House.

       15. Cold and dry:
      16. Cold and very dry : Pamir.

      The actual mean temperature of the earth amounted, according to his computa-
 tion, to 57° F., and this isotherm, which separated types 8 and 9, also divided De
 CandoUe's ' Mikrothermes' from the plants requiring a greater amount of warmth.

      The author further illustrated his paper by a number of diagrams giving the
 curves of the temperature, rainfall, and humidity, and also by a chart of the world
 exhibiting the number of rainy days.

 considered, and it is shown that the concave curve of water-erosion is partly

   6. On the Pettersson-N^ansen Insulating Water-bottle.

          By Hugh Robert Mill, D.Sc, LL.D}

   Professor Pettersson has, in conjunction with Professor Nansen, completed a

   modification of his well-known apparatus for obtaining samples of sea-water
   Awithout change of temperature,
                                    specimen of the improved water-bottle con-

   structed by Messrs. Ericsson, of Stockholm and London, was exhibited. The

   purpose of this apparatus is to enclose a quantity of sea-water at any desired depth,

   to hold it securely, and to bring it to the surface without any change of tempera-

   ture exceeding one hundredth of a degree Centigrade. The previous form of insu-

   lating water-bottle was found by Dr. Nansen in his arctic expedition to be less

   trustworthy at great depths than in shallow water ; hence the suggestions which

   resulted in the new apparatus. The insulation, which is the essential feature of the

   water-bottle, is secured by a series of concentric chambers of non-conductin"-

   material which are simultaneously filled with water, and so protect the portion,

   measuring about two litres, which occupies the large central tube. The walls of

   the inner tubes are so constructed as not to become heated by compression at

   the greatest depth. This is secured by using metal, which is heated by com-

   pression, and indiarubber, which is cooled by compi-ession, in such proportions as

   to ensure constancy of temperature for the whole structure.

   The water-bottle when set is held apart, so that the base, sides, and lid are

   separated, and the water passes freely through the tubes as the apparatus descends.

   When the apparatus is being drawn up a propeller (which during the descent

   revolves freely) engages with a screw and releases a heavy weight, which closes

   Anand locks the whole rigidly togethei'.  arrangement is provided for the relief of

   pressure as the included water expands on being hauled up, The temperature is

   ascertained by a thermometer, protected againt pressure, enclosed in the central

   tube, and projecting sufficiently far to be easily read. If preferred, the aperture for

   the thermometer may be closed by a screw and the thermometer inserted when the
   Awater-bottle is brought up.
                                 reversing thermometer to give the temperature of

   the water independently may be attached to the upper part of the water-bottle,

   and is set in action at the moment of closing. The whole apparatus weighs about

   581b., and is used on a wire line and worked by a steam winch.

   During August of this year the improved water-bottle was tested by Professor

I  Nansen on board the Michael Sars in the sea between Iceland and Spitsbergen, and
   at the greatest depth met with (3,000 metres = 1,670 fathoms) the insulation was

   perfect. On August 11a sample was taken from 3,000 metres, and when it came

   up the thermometer read : l°-285 C, after five minutes l°-283, after nine minutes

   l°-270, and after eleven minutes 1°-210. On August 13 in a sample from 2,000

   metres the thermometer showed 1°-135, after five minutes 1°-135, after six minutes

   1°-130, and after eight minutes 1°-110. Professor Nansen considers it essential

   to use an included thermometer,

     Section F.--ECONOMIC > SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

        --President of the Section' Major P. G. Ceaigie, V.P.S.S.

                            THURSDA Y, SEPTEMBER G.

      The President delivered the following Address :

The ' Advancement of Science' is the motive wherewith the British Association
brin"-s annually together, In autumnal conclave, a gathering of those who desire
to tell and those who wish to hear something of the most recent developments of

scientific labour. Entrusted for the session with the high honour of presiding
over a Section where the chair has from time to time been occupied by a long
roll of distinguished men. whose qualifications for the task necessarily far outstrip

any I could pretend to claim, I may yet follow the example set by such authorities
in maintaining on your behalf, and on my own, that the right production, the
proper treatment, and the wise grouping oif garnered facts concerning man aud
his relations to the State as a member of society constitute a study second in

importance to no other form of research. Moreover, such expert discussion of
statistical methods and statistical results as ought to be possible in this Section

should, I thiuk, prove a factor of no small moment in its bearing on the true

advancement of Science in its broadest sense, whether physical, economic, or

 political.

      Without the claim to speak to you on the lines which could be appropriately

adopted by some former Presidents, who have held positions of eminence, won

either in the highest fields of politics or earned by patient work in the cloistered
retreats of academic study, I come here rather to represent those who form, as it
were, the hewers of wood and drawers of water for the economic controversialists
of the day. As such we are concerned in the dally outturn of raw statistical
material, and we are naturally jealous as to the use to be made of our figures by
those who employ them in the process of scientific deduction, in the business of

practical administration, or in the eflPorts of philosophic teaching.

     "Whatever be the precise meaning we are willing to accord to the term of

--'statistics' and both the primary interpretation and the proper scope of the
--expression have been dlfierently construed I believe you will agree with me in

 echoing the opinion expressed, I think, by a very distinguished past President
 of this Assoclntion, that nearly all the grandest discoveries in science have been
but the rewards of accurate measurement and patient long-continued labour in the
sifting of numerical results.

     Not only thus may we claim for what is sometimes looked upon as the merely
mechanical part of statistical work a directly educational eflect on the honest
workers themselves, in the training and discipline of mind which are required for

the handling and weighing, the balancing and comparing of numerically arranged

facts ; we may go further and assert that every science in its turn has occasion to
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  821

rely on the statistician's art, and that the true advancement of knowledge in what-

ever path we take depends quite as much on the avoidance of rash conclusions as

on the faculty of quick perception of apparent results.

      There is then this lesson to be learned in the discussions to be held in this

Section, and it is one on which, in opening our deliberations, I think I am fairly

entitled to insist. Since accurate statistical data are fundamental to sound argu-

ment and correct deduction? in any sphere of science, too great care cannot be

expended in the task of making sure that figures given to the public are really

what they claim to be. Where a comparison is to be made it is our business to

see a practical identity in the character of the facts to be observed, and to give

such warning as is requisite to guard against the possibility of over-strained and

illegitimate use of the data by those into whose hands they may ultimately come.
Where a deduction is to be made or a conclusion is to he announced by the original

compiler himself, it is well, too, he should remember that a statistical decision

should have in it something of judicial deliberation and gravity, and should bo

given to the world only after the application of a chastened scepticism and distrust

to the testing of the first impressions to which the bare numbers that appear on
the surface of any calculation seem to point.

     Lastly, let us not overlook the prescriptive cautions of many past masters in

statistical work to distrust big totals and dissect general averages.

   We are all of us familiar with the vastly larger space accorded to statistics in

debate in the second half of the dying century, how readily the arbitrament of
figures is now appealed to by the politician or the journalist, by the man of

science or the philosopher. This very fact, however, constitutes in itself a

danger, and I trust, therefore, I may be forgiven if I interpose between the
Section and its prepared work by preaching from the Chair -with some insist-
ence the somewhat trite doctrine that statistical and economic science has few
greater enemies than those who fail to apply the most rigid tests to the sufficiency

of the elementary figures on which a theory is to be formed or au administrative
act accomplished. Nor, indeed, is a much smaller oSence involved in the over-
confident use, whether for international comparisons or for those flights of prophecy

in which we all like from time to time to indulge, of figures not in their immediate

connection themselves erroneous, but which are, nevertheless, not quite strong
enough to bear the strain of the superstructure to be reared, or which are devoid

of the essential elements of true comparability of condition.

     It is then alike for the makers and the users of statistics to observe much
caution in their own utterances and in the manufacture of those missiles of con-
troversy which every table furnisbes, and which in the hasty discussions of our
day, when mere rapidity is exalted almost to the place of a virtue, are apt at times
to prove dangerous to those who wield them, whether in the press, the lecture-

room, or the senate.

    Most of all is it incumhent on one who ventures on the duties of this Chair
with none of the opportunities of reflection which many professorial predecessors
must have enjoyed, and who comes straight from the daily turmoil of executive

work and the discharge of continuous official service, to exercise some reticence in

venturing on expressions of individual opinion. In what I may say, therefore,
by way of preface to your discussions I would endeavour to confine my remarks
to a notice of some of the chief statistical investigations now impending and

an account of the difficulties to be encountered by the statistician in his work,

illustrating, from the class of subjects with which my work has made me familiar,

the sorts of obstacles which hinder the accurate presentation of international
comparisons of agi-icultural conditions.

   --The entire omission of a sectional address for which there is, I believe, pre-

--cedent in your records or the substitution of a simple speech for a reasoned paper,

as was allowed to the distinguished statesman who presided at the last Bradford
meeting, on the score of the demands of the State on the services of its servants,

might, perhaps, have met my case and relieved me of a duty to which I feel far
from equal, and you of listening to my crude remarks. This indulgence has not,

however, been accorded, and I must, therefore, crave the pardon of the Section I can
--822 REPORT 1900.

only serve so badly, and virge its members, in the later discussions, to supply the
shortcomings of the occupant of the Chair.

     Of all statistical work the enumeration of the units of population must ever
take the foremost place, and on the eve of the census to be taken before many
more months have passed a reference to that great impending task could hardly
be omitted on this occasion. In common with all students of the machinery of

--census-taking I am sure I echo the feelings of the Section as I do those of the
--Eoyal Statistical Society, vrho have long laboured in this direction in deeply

regretting that the first census of the twentieth century is not to possess the

distinction many had hoped to see conferred upon it of being by preliminary

-- --announcement as I hope it may prove to be in ultimate fact the first of a series

not of decennial but of quinquennial countings of the people.

     The growing complexity of social conditions and speed of life in all its functions
at the present date, contrasted with the leisurely movements of a hundred years
a^o, would alone and amply justify a more frequent stock-taking of the inhabitants
of Great Britain than has been the practice in the past. The practical wants of our
much-multiplied system of local government cannot fail, I believe, ere long to
bring about the granting of an intermediate numbering, even if for the moment
 other considerations overrule the more academic pleas of statisticians for this
reform, or the arguments, soimd as I believe them to be, for a permanent Census
 Office, a permanent Census Act, and a trained and continuous Census Staff', to

whom preparation of the machinery beforehand and detailed elaboration of the

 results after the actual census year might with real economy be entrusted.

     Like probably many another student of practical statistical organisation, I
have to own to some modification of the demands for enquiry into the condition

 as well as the numbers of the people, which I once believed might be properly
 combined with the actual operations of enumeration. Some little experience in
 measuring the extent and the value of the answers elicited by question and by

 schedule have shown me that with due regard to the quality, if not even to the

 quantity, of the replies extracted from the least instructed section of the popu-
 lation, you must limit your curiosity unless you are to be landed in doubt, in
 difficulty, and in misconception.

      Specific and parallel enquiries in point of time by one or another central

 body may no doubt be devised and directed so as to bring out a definite and

 limited series of facts, afi'ording matter to be compared with population totals.
 But to load the census proper with side issues is not to help forward the best type

 of statistical knowledge, and the attempt may well be pushed too far. I fancy
 there is now some reason to believe that ten years ago we erred in this respect. For
 these reasons I have never in recent years been able to go along with many active

  and highly intelligent foreign colleagues, whose more sanguine aspirations as to
 possibilities of what a census can tell it is always pleasing to witness, even if the

 feasibility of their suggested developments may be questioned.
      Sound and reasonable advice on such a subject may be found in the timely

 remarks of my colleague Mr. J. A. Baines, in his paper to the Royal Statistical

 Society in February last on the ' limitations ' of census-taking. From no better or
 more practical source could we hope to be instructed on what can and what can

 not with advantage be got than from the able officer whose superintendence of
 the vast Indian Census of 1891 brought him such widespread recognition.

      The mention I have made of the suggestions of foreign statisticians on census-
 taking reminds me that although the proposal which has been before the Inter-

  national Statistical Institute in one form or another for a synchronous ' world's

 census,' at the moment of passing from one century to another, is hardly likely,

  for administrative reasons and in view of the previous fixtures of the great census-

  taking Governments of the etirth, to be literally realised, the dates of the great
  countings of the nations will nevertheless come sufficiently close for all practical
  comparisons. The great Russian enumeration, on the success of which M. Troinitsky
  is so heartily to be congratulated, is not yet long accomplished. The twelfth

 census of the United States is now being taken. The Scandinavian enquiry
TBANSACTIOXS OF SECTION F.  823

  coincides with the century's end, the Italian and the Spanish censuses are already
  overdue, and both France and England take their count within a few months after

  the twentieth century has hegun.

      Not persons onty, but their conditions, their possessions, their trade, and their

 mburdens are all subjects of perennial statistical enquiry, and connection with the

  last of these groups in the near future the attention of statistical critics will no
 doubt be drawn again to the massive collection of materials respecting local taxes,

 their growth and pressure, which may be looked for from the final report of the

 Royal Commission on Local Taxation. How many times in the last half of this

 century this section of our finance has been debated here I have not been able to
 ascertain. In one form or another it has exercised a fascination on the minds of
  some of our most active economists. Personally I confess the field was one of the

 first in which I ventured to make some enquiry and draw tabular comparisons. To
 this I was incited by the study, not at first of the second-hand stores of the
 many blue-books which have seen the light on this matter, but rather by the

 peculiar circumstances of my local residence in a Yorkshire township four-and-

 thirty years ago, when local government and local rates of necessity came home
 with primary concern to one who happened, like myself, to be the sole inhabitant

 householder of an area constituting for several purposes a unit of local

 administration.

       I cannot pretend to have followed through the later years of the century the
 wider developments of these controversies, which were far from simple even in

 the days when the issue was limited to a question of pressure of the ratal system
 on agricultural land. Now, when the vast and complicated outlay of the great
 urban centres on matters which, in time past, we were not disposed to regard as

 subjects of taxation at all^ but rather of directly remunerative outlay, has to be
 brought into the survey, it may" well tax the ingenuity of our younger statisticians

to unravel the facts, and it may try the courage and the skill of the economists to
pronounce, as this Section may be expected to do before its sittings close, as to the

 orthodox limits and sphere of ever-extending municipal expenditure and municipal

 trade.

     The statistical part of such enquiries as these will abound with problems in the
working out of which it will be well to recall the warnings I have indicated as to
the danger attending the use of non-comparative or defective data. Pitfalls
innumerable await the less wary controversialist in such questions as these, which
seem near at hand, while yet wider discussion on the relative pressure and com-
parative growth of taxes generally may erelong attract renewed attention, as well
as the subjects of statistical debate which centre round the records of crime and
its punishment, of educational facilities and the economic results of their super-
vision by the State, or, again, of excursions into the intricate region of labour and
wages, wherein some of our section have already pursued useful investigations.
In all and every one of these topics the scientific statistician will have to re-
member that his profession does not allow him to be a partisan advocate of one or
the other view, in search of some figures to illustrate or decorate a predetermined

theory. On the contrary, his function is to work in the cold, clear light of pure

scientific research, and with a single aim to free the facts of each case from obscurity
and place the data before the world in such shape as to allow a true j udgment to
be recorded.

      Quite as full of difficult problems and obstinately non-comparable figures will be
found to be the use of statistics of production and of trade. The varj'ing and

scanty records of one period may have to be viewed in connection with and inter-

preted by the better and fuller data of the day, and the conditions of one country

may have to be contrasted with those of another, while the puzzling vai'iations in

the system employed have to be allowed for and discounted in the conclusions.

     Perhaps the difficulties of just comparison between the records of one time and

another, or one State and its neighbour, come home to me with peculiar emphasis
when the statistics dealt with relate to agricultural conditions. With ourselves
824 EEPORT-- 1900.

and still more in certain quarters abroad regular agricultural statistics are of quite

recent birth.

It is difficult, perhaps, for us now to recall the comparatively recent origin of

comprehensive statistics of ao:riculture in Great Britain. Writers of note,

ecoimmist?, and philosophers had no doubt from early times ventured to make

estimates of more or less individual authority on the probable magnitude of our

cagricultural resources. Expert witnesses, with more or less opportunities of indi-

vidual observations, came before Parliamentary Committees with rough impressions

of the extent of our cultivated area and the distribution of the crops which it bore.

The labours of the old Board of Agriculture, which existed at the end of the last and

for a few years at the beginning of this century, amassed, no doubt, much valuable

though scattered local information and many details of farming practice, but they

completed no such exact survey as would have proved iuvaluable now to the

statisticians of 1900 respecting the use made of the soil of our country a hundred

years ago. The erroneous estimate of 47,000,000 acres of total area assigned to Eng-

land by the Chairman of that Board, when later data proved the measurements to

yield 10,000,000 acres less, is a warning of the care which is needed in the use of

such figures as were available in those distant days

After efforts more or less spasmodic in 1831, again in 1845, and yet again in the

more complete work of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland in 1854-

7, encouraged by the verdict of the House of Lords' Committee of 1855, and fortified

by the repeated recommendations of International Statistical Congresses, the House

of Commons was, in 1864, persuaded by Sir James Caird to pass a resolution for the

establishment of annual agricultural returns. These were first collected in 1866, and

one year later thej' took the more complete form which gave us the continuous

records Great Britain now possesses for tracing the development or retrogression of

our country in agricultural conditions throughout the last third of the nineteenth

century. The data thus obtained must, of course, be read with full allowance for

some minute but inevitable variations of definition due to the gradual improvement

and growing completeness of the returns themselves, first under the Board of Trade,

then under the care of the Privy Council, and now under the Board of Agriculture.

Agricultural statistics, whether in this or other countries, are assuredly not

exempt from the need of careful and intelligent handling and of caution in

drawing comparisons. The leading features to which any agricultural enquiry is

directed are naturally the extent and characteristic modes of the occupation of

the surface, the number of persons engaged and the size of their holdings, the

area and yield of the distinctive crops, and the numbers and classes of live stock.

Some of these points can, and others with advantage cannot, be made the subject

of direct annual enquiry and compilation. But in all cases questions as to precision

of definition arise when the careful investigator looks below the surface to see what

the figures really mean.

The total measured areas of the countries we desire to contrast may, it is true,

be fairly accurately given, though even here there is room for error, in regard to

the practice of including or excluding areas covered by inland and tidal waters,

Whenlakes, and rivers.    the next step is taken, and it is desired to contrast the

respective areas actually made use of for productive purposes, difSculties of com-

parison at once present themselves. The phrase ' cultivated ' area in our country

is one to which, at least in unofficial if not in Government publications, two

distiuct meanings are often attached. The term is sometimes used as if in some

sense synonymous with the arable surface, whereas in the other, and with us by

long tradition the ofiicial sense, the term covers all land, other than woodlands

or rough wastes and mountain grazings, utilised for agriculture, whether under the

category of permanent grass or under yearly varying crops.

Nor is uniformity of practice much greater as regards the methods of returning

the actual agricultural population. The number of persons actually employed,

male and femHle, may as a rule be distinguished, but all countries are not agreed

as to what employment means. The practice as to who are and who are not

to be regarded as dependents, or as occasional and casual workers, may vary

greatly. In all countries, and perhaps rather more abroad than here, there are
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  825

many persons who combine an agricultural with some other calling, and this in
an infinitely varying degree. The German and some other statistics endeavour

laboriously to give tables which take account of these persons with double

occupations and allot to them a place under more than one head. In England we

have no provision in our census for these cases, and a farmer and brewer or a

labourer engaged sometimes on a farm and at other times at other work may be

classed by the accident of the first entry in one or other categoi'y at random.

    By what is nearly a common consent, the attempted enumeration of the

agriculturally occupied population is connected rather with the general enquiries

of the census than with the crop returns of each year. Its value of necessity
depends on the coincident and relative record of the occupations, other than
agricultural, in which the inhabitants of any country are engaged. Such con-

siderations supply the answer to some of our less reflective writers on this

question, who would have a perennial investigation going on into the available

--supply of agricultural labour year by year, if not month by month. The move-

ment in the direction of concentration of growing numbers of the workers of a
nation in the urban districts, which is apparent iu so many countries besides our
own, and under the most opposite conditions of Governmental polity or agri-

cultural organisation, will no doubt form in a short time a very interesting topic
of statistical discussion. But the general figures cannot be handled with very

great advantage now at the distance of wellnigh a decade from the last enumera-
tions and at the moment when the taking of a new census is at hand. Until

that enquiry reveals its facts, the student of questions of relative rural population

may be referred to the mine of information collected by the Royal Commission
on Labour, and the late Mr. W. 0. Little's admirable and exhaustive analysis,

and to the most valuable statistical buff-book which the Board of Trade have

just issued from the pen of Mr. Wilson Fox.

     Equally or even more full of pitfalls for comparison are statistics of the size of
holdings, whether the comparison be made between one date and another in a
country like our own, or between one country and another. Not only will the
grades employed necessarily vary between country and country, but the starting-
point and detinition of what is a ' holding ' is usually entirely different.

      In one of the earliest meetings of the International Statistical Institute at

Rome I drew attention to the barrier thus offered to international comparisons on
the latter point. I then showed how occasionally it may happen that the recog-
nised 'holdings ' seem to have included every plot, however minute. Germany and
Belgium; and I may add Ireland, apparently made a beginning at zero. Great

Britain at one time regarded a quarter of an acre as a limit of statistical enquiry,
although since 1892 restricting the term ' agricultural holding ' to something over
an acre of land. Elsewhere, as in Holland and in the United States, refusals,
except under specially defined conditions, to take anything less than a plot of two

and a half or three acres in extent as a starting-point in the agricultural

enumerations are encountered.

     It is not always remembered that we ourselves have, even within the com-

paratively brief course of our official agricultural returns in Great Britain, held

more than one opinion as to what the siarting-poiut should be. At the first
collection of these statistics nothing under five acres was taken account of as agri-
cultural. The scope of the annual enquiry was subsequently extended to plots of
a quarter of an acre, and the limit was raised again eight years ago to the present
requirement, which refrains from requesting annual details of the acreage of their
crops from the occupiers of holdings of a single acre or less. As a matter of
administrative convenience there is very considerable advantage in the course now
pursued, and no real statistical loss is involved, for the land occupied by the
various petty crofts or gardens which escape annual record was found not to

 reach one-tenth of one per cent, of the cultivated area, and such rare changes as
 might occur in the crops raised on these minute sections of territory could in no
 perceptible degree affect the value of the returns as affording a general view of

 the curreut chfinge of agricultural practice. Changes, however, iu the unit of
826 REPORT--1900.

area, as well as changes even in the direction of improvement in the machinery of

collection, are all hindrances to very close and accurate comparisons.

Attempts have no doubt been made to enumerate separately the strips of land

held as p-ardens or allotments, at different dates, in England, but considerations

such as I have above indicated have rendered the results of much less statistical

value than can be claimed for the yearly returns, and the failures of some of these

repeated attempts furnish a conspicuous warning against overloading the never

very simple task of rural stock-taking by too frequent and necessarily costly

enquiries into very minute points of agricultural condition.

Even in records of the numbers of animals there is room for much misunder-

standing. ' Horses ' are defined differently in the returns of different countries,

at one place the numbers including trade and private horses, in another only

those engaged in agriculture. The ages and the classes of the animals, and the dates

of the collection again, may and do vary considerably, and this may bring in lambs

in one countrj' and omit some portions of this group in another. Even cows, it is
found, may mean one thing in one country and another in another, and may be

returned with other cattle in a single class or shown separately from other horned

stock. Oxen are shown in some countries with no distinction of class or age
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

in others those still used for working the farm may be distinguished from those

reared for purposes of meat production only. All these cautions are only examples

of the danger of venturing on too close reliance on data of this kind in interna-

tional comparisons.

Over and above all difficulties due to difference of agricultural practice and

local definitions, the most serious bar to exact comparison of the course of

agriculture in different countries is the widely varying practice as to the intervals

at which statistics are collected. Live stock maybe enumerated, as with ourselves,

in France, or in the United States, annnally, -while wide gaps occur between the

years of stock-taking elsewhere. The acreage of each crop in each season may be

recorded in one country                                                                                             in another five or ten  years, in  some  cases even  fifteen,
                                                                                                                 ;

may elapse between the enquiries on this essential point, and estimates of produce

checked by no local examination of the surface occupied too often prove delusive

guides to the results of particular years. These gaps are the dread of any one

who sets himself seriously to examine what has been the general movement either

in the changing areas of crop distribution or in the relative growth or decline of

agricultural production abroad.

Continuous annual data of acreage, production, and live stock ought, however,

to be within the reach of most fully equipped Governments of modern times. The

method of the collection will necessarily differ. Information obtained direct from

the immediate producer by written schedule is perhaps available nowhere but in
our own land. Tlie fact is one which says something for progressive intelligence and

the general support which the State receives from the great bulk of farmers of Great

Britain, and the working of our system has attracted much attention of late from

those responsible for the conduct and development of agricultural statistics in

Weforeign countries.  may pardonably view our position in this country with

satisfaction Avhen it is recognised how largely foreign correspondents are yearly

seeking for more and more information as to how so big a statistical operation

is annually accomplished here between June 4 and August 28 in the time and

with the machinery at our command. To the statisticians of Russia, Spain, Italy,

Germany, Denmark, and even of Japan we have had lately to explain our process.

Could some approach to this system be obtained, the means for accurate measure-

ment of the world's agricultural movements would he greatly helped, and it may

at least be hoped that a generation hence facilities will abound for a closer review

of the position of food supply and production than is now feasible. But it is not

necessary to wait quite so long for some general glimpse of the facts. Already in

France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Roumania, Russia, and the United States
among foreign countries, in our Indian possessions, and in our Australasian colonies,

-- --we find indeed annual statements not all, however, collected similarly of the

area under the principal grain crops. Two only of the provinces of the Canadian

Dominion venture on annual returns. Annual, if later, figures reach us from the

smaller States of Holland and Sweden, and from Algeria and Japan.

It is not for us here, like amateur war-critics distributing praise and blame from

our armchairs on statisticians engaged in local conflict with the difficulty of crop-

collection abroad, to forget the relative compactness of the area of these islands

and the relatively developed intelligence of an agricultural population farming, on
Wethe average, larger holdings than most of our continental neighbours.
                                                                         ought

not, therefore, to refuse to appreciate the difficulties, administrative and financial,

which a close adoption of anything lilce the British system would involve, either

where the peasant population is predominant or where the areas to be accounted

for are vast, as in the United States or in Russia.

It is, I thinli, in the circumstances not illegitimate to use, at all events for

comparison of the state of matters within the same country, the data which are

now available from year to year. With less contidence we may even quote, as

presumptive indications of the directions of movements, the isolated returns of

acreage for particular years which alone some States supply. That there is peril,

however, in such a course may be seen by what is proved to have happened in a

country like France, whence we do receive continuous data. For the past quarter

of a century the acres devoted to wheat in France have been practically the same,

17,000,000 acres. One single exception appears, however, in the season of 1891,

when under exceptional climatic conditions an area of only 14,000,000 acres was

reported. Now, had France i-endered only occasional acreage records, like her

Belgian neighbour, like Denmark, or like Argentina, and had the year 1891 chanced

to be the date of the enquiry, an investigation of the rise or fall of wheat culture

in Europe might have been deflected from a true conclusion by the deceptive record

of a state of matters occurring only once in a single exceptional season, and

immediately recovered from.

In any attempts which may be made, even within the period of fairly reliable

agricultural statistics, to trace the features of the changes of the past twenty or thirty

years, it is necessary to remember that, as between one country and another, the

data can be received only with much reserve, and as strictly comparative, if even

that, only within the respective States compared at different dates.

     Attempts to utilise statistical data, to determine the relative development of
agriculture in different parts of the world and at different periods of time, are
sometimes made with regard solely to what is described as the world's aggregate
of one or two leading individual products as typical as the rest ; or, again, one or
two typical countries, or at least countries where the available information is
more complete than elsewhere, are chosen, and the course of development or
decline of their crop areas or the several descriptions of their animal produce is

traced and compared.
     Certain obvious objections, which it is well to recognise, impede the student

of figures who resolves to proceed on the first of these methods. At the outset he
is arrested by embarrassment attending the choice of what single products are to

be held as representative of agricultural outturn. The most usual of all selec-
tions is that which restricts enquiries to the case of wheat. This course appears
to be rendei-ed, comparatively speaking, easy, as more has probably been written
and more statistics, official or unofficial, theoretical or commercial, actual or
imaginary, have been compiled, with regard to this bread grain than for any other
crop. But it is time we recognised that wheat has had too much and too exclu-
sive attention directed to it as a type of agricultural production. Very widely as
it is undoubtedly used in the form of bread, even as food its place is occupied at
one time or another, and in one country or another, by other substitutes, and its
cultivation is, after all, not the employment which demands the most attention
and most skill at the hands of the agriculturist. Not only do rye and even
maize serve as substitutes or supplements in feeding man, but other crops, such as
oats, barley, millet, rice, and so on, have claims to greater notice than they
receive, and play a direct as well as indirect part in providing food. Cotton, flax,
and wool are other typical products, the use of which for clothing is all-important

828 REPORT-- 1900.

to an enormous population, and the extension or retrogression of such crops
deserves some of the attention of the agricultural statistician. Tea, coffee, wine,
spirits, and beer are, it is not to be forgotten, agricultural products in one clime or
another, either directly or indirectly ; and crops so important as sugar or tobacco
·are almost to be classed as necessaries of existence. Of yearly growing importance

is it also, in these days, when the animal portion of our food supply bulks so much
more fully than before in the daily rations of populations as they grow in wealth
and increase in consumptive power, that we should closely follow the fluctuations

in the live stock maintained for food and learn the teaching of the agricultural
returns on the manufacture of beef, of mutton, of pig meat, or of milk.

     The growing requireicents of our 40,000,000 of population in this country
dependent for a large proportion of their meat on cattle, sheep, and swine fed in

--other lands and in some of the most distant countries of the globe have pro-

voked a series of enquiries into the extent of our domestic production and the
density of the herds and flocks maintained on like areas of the surface of the other
and different regions.

     It is half a century since Sir James Caird, in calling the attention of farmers
to what he foresaw was the certain growth of the demand for butcher's meat, for
milk, and for butter in the United Kingdom, argued that as the expenditure of
 the lower classes increased the development of household outlay with increasing
means would necessarily take this direction. Venturing a little beyond the safe

ground of statistical deduction as to what was forthcoming from our own stock,

 it is true he prophesied that it would not be found practicable to import fresh
 provisions coming from distant countries, and he therefore suggested that the

enterprising home producer would have the full market here practically at his own
<.ommand. The same authority repeated in 18GS his advice as to the direction

 the development of agriculture here might take, placing the exteiit of the reliance
 of the British consumer on the foreigner at only one-ninth part of his supply of
 meat, and one-fifth of his consumption of butter and of cheese. That these ratios
 have altered since, to the detriment of the producer, if to the benefit of the con-
 sumer, assuredly does not render the need of statistical enquiry into meat and milk
 production less urgent than it was as a most important factor in the nation's food

 supply.

      Sixteen years ago, when this Association met at Montreal, I ventured to lay
 before this Section some data on the nature and extent of our meat supplies and

 the scale of our production, based in the latter case mainly on the very practical

--investigation of a former President of the Royal Agricultural Society Sir H. M.
--Thompson but adapted to the data of the current agricultural returns of live

 stock. For numerous purposes the formula I then employed has since been
 followed as convenient for serial comparisons of annual results in the statistics
 founded on reports by lloyal Commissions and Parliamentary Committees. But
 no student of statistics will contend that the conditions of agricultural production
 are ever absolutely permanent, and I have seen there are not wanting opinions

 that it may be needful, from one cause or another, to revise the scales of the calcu-

 lation, and to compare the most recent rate of meat production in this country
 with that of other lands.

      Few subjects seem to me to possess more practical interest for those willing to

 aid in statistical research, competent to apply to the numerical data a cor-
 responding knowledge of the development of stock-feeding in recent years and in

 --different countries. I commend a re-investigation of this subject and the kin-

  dred one of milk production and the manufacture of dairy produce in this country

 --and abroad on the lines in the one case of the inquiry of 1871, and in the other
 --on the lines which Mr. Rew suggested in a paper in 1892 to the Royal Statistical

  Society to the best attention of a younger generation of estimators. Whether and
  how far the earlier maturity of our present breeds of sheep and cattle and swine
  has resulted in the production of a larger annual volume of meat is a factor
  which should have careful consideration, and if a careful inquiry should suggest

  the time for revision has arrived respecting the G7 tons of beef, the 12^ tons of
  pauttoii, or the 69|- tons of pig meat I and others have hitherto used fts the e(jui-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  829

 Valent of tlie annual production'of 1,000 animals of eacli type respectively I should

 not be unprepared to make wliatever change is proved needful, despite the re-
 luctance with which every statistician forsakes, even on good grounds, a basis
 of conversion which has served without break of continuity for the comparison of
 more than thirty years.

    How largely the demands of a population like our own have upset the old pro-

portions of our reliance on imported meat and imported milk products may be
 learned from the fact that the latest calculation which I have made suggests a
 meat consumption of no less than 182 lbs. per head in the United Kingdom,

 against a little over 100 lbs. thirty years ago, more than two-fifths of the whole

now reaching us from foreign countries or British possessions, against the ninth

 part at which Sir James Caird estimated the foreign quota.

     The mention of these meat estimates suggests a reference, by way of illustration,

 to the extremely interesting and legitimate application of the important deductions

 from purely agricultural statistics possible when once the temptation to narrow
 the question to one of wheat production and wheat supply is resisted, which was

made by my colleague, Mr. (Crawford, in a paper read to the Eoyal Statistical

 Society last winter. The calculations made dealt with the relative dimensions
 and sources of the food supply of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and

--Belgium. The deductions made from the data available, and the useful discus-

sions thus provoked including a supplementary memorandum by Mr. Hooker on

 the relative forces occupied in production under the differing conditions of British

and Continental farming-- are replete with interest to the future investigator who

is willing to face the labour of looking below the surface .either of agricultural
 statistics or of import or export returns into the economic meaning of the situa-

tion thus disclosed. No lesson, perhaps, of this paper is more worthy to be

remembered than the warning which it gives to the class of writers who, without
 a due appreciation of the facts, are as ready, from the vantage-ground of the
editorial chair, to fight the battle of the agriculturist for him on paper, as to

teach our generals how to handle a British army in the field.
     But for considerations often overlooked, which were on this occasion put

forward, the abolition of our dependence on sea-borne produce, it is sometimes

argued, could be procured by a simple extension of our own agricultural area.
What that extension would have to be it is now shown is sometliing much more
serious than many imagine. It is not alone that to fill the gap of our imports
of wheat and flour would take another 6,000,000 acres of the prolific quality of

our own, but the direct production of the imported meat and dairy produce and of
the numerous feeding stuffs required for the manufacture of our present quota of
animal food raised at home would at the most modest computation necessitate
17,000,000 acres more to be added to our productive area, and that, be it
remembered, without withdrawing any portion whatever of our present surface,
which, whether under crop or grass, helps to sustain our outturn at the present
level. The prospects of a practical annexation of this aggregate of 23,000,000

acres to those now under cultivation at home I confess do not seem to me great.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             b*-

     Although the attempt to grasp the relative magnitude of the agricultural
production of one State as compared with another, 'or to note the growth or decline
of its prominence in the cultivation of particular staples, or the manufacture of

particular kinds of human food, is always an enterprise of difficulty in existing
statistical conditions, it is one which has fascination for many classes of economists

and politicians. If attempted at all it is well to recognise that there are inevitable
dangers in the task, and that if any figures are relied on as conclusive their
meaning must be interpreted by sooie knowledge of the demographic conditions
of each State and its geographical, climatic, and agricultural circumstances.

     Taking a few of the most conspicuous products of the soil, it will generally be
found that a very few leading States are so particularly identified with one or
other type of production that the examination of their records is therefore
available as a guide to the course of a single crop.

     ProbaHy quite two-thirds of the cotton of the world is gi'own in the United
States aloue, where the surface so employed reaches 25,000,000 acres as compared

·with under 9,000,000 acres in British India, the next largest cotton-growing region
of which statistical record exists. In wool the produce of the Australasian

-- --Colonies of Great Britain with flocks which still exceed 100,000,000 head makes

much the largest contribution to the total. In rice, so far as statistics carry us,

our Indian possessions head the list of producers. In hops the English crop still

probably exceeds the German in production, although the latter with larger area

closely contests the place. In tobacco, while the acreage apparently employed in
British India is nearly double the 595,000 acres in the United States, no other
country in our statistical recoids comes within one-seventh of the American
area. The vineyards of Italy are returned as covering 8,500,000 acres, and
those of France 4,300,000 acres, while those of Austria and Hungary, next in
magnitude, cover but a seventh part of the last-mentioned figure. Itussia bulks
largely as a grower of flax, aud alone shows a whole third of the area of barley
recorded in all the countries which supply returns, and if in the case of potatoes
the Russian acreage is not very difierent from that of Germany the total produc-
tion of the latter empire reaches the largest aggregate of any single country.

     If the subject of enquiry be the place of wheat-growing in the world at one
date or another, it would not be to the older European countries, other than Russia

at all events, we should turn to see where the surface so utilised was extending.

Reckoned by tlie percentage of her cereal area which she still devotes to wheat,
France, with 47 per cent, under the crop, or Italy, with 55 per cent., would
naturally be selected as typical wheat-growers ; but both are practically in a
stationary or, collectively, even in a slightly retrograding position. It is on the
other side of the Atlantic where the most noteworthy movements have occurred.
In comparatively new exporting countries, such as Argentina and Canada,
though the statistics from neither are complete, wheat areas still extend, and
that of the United States, though fluctuating with great sensitiveness under vary-
ing price conditions, and moving from one centre to another westward or north-

westward across the American continent, is now reported as covering 44,600,000
acres. This total, it must be allowed, whatever views may be held as to future

progress, makes the United States a typical grower of this particular cereal, to
which it gives an importance second only to the still more extensive product of

American soil, to which we give the name of maize, but to which alone in Ameri-

can parlance is allowed the title of corn,

     The leading changes in the production of typical crops as measured by the
acreage, and the stock of cattle, sheep, and swiue recorded at or near the com-

mencement, the middle, and the close of the past thirty years, may be contrasted

for exporting countries with expanding populations and growing agriculture, and
in countries where these conditions are absent, or in a typical consuming centre

like our own country. Relying on the agricultural returns of the United States,

a table could be constructed, as under, for three dates within the past thirty years
which furnish the following indication of agricultural changes:

                                United States

38,600,000, and grew an acre of maize for each unit of tbe population, and an
acre of wheat for every two persons, and somewhat more than an acre of cotton

for every four. At this period the surplus exported to other nations, it may be

added, represented two-thirds of the cotton, rather more than one-fifth of the

wheat, but less than one per cent, of the maize.
     In 1885 the population had augmented to an estimated total of 50,000,000, or

by 45 per cent. The area under the crops above quoted had meantime been ex-
tended in nearly twice this ratio. The United States exported still about two-
thirds of the cotton grown ; the wheat export was slightly greater in proportion
to the product than before, or 26 per cent., while neai'ly 3 per cent of the maize
crop found a market abroad.

    The population of the States is now estimated to have risen to 76,000,000, or
twice what it was thirty years ago, altliough the census has yet to say if this
calculation has been realised. The cultivation of maize had meantime reached
82,000,000 acres, wheat was reported to cover 44,000,000 acres, and cotton

25,000,000 acres, while the foreign market received 65 per cent, of the cotton,

33 per cent, of the wlieat, and now as much as 9 per cent, of the maize grown on

these areas.

     In none of these cases, it will be noted, has the area under crop failed to
increase, but in all the rate of increase was distinctly slower in the second than
in the first half of the period. If time sufficed to trace the annual course of move-
ment between the contrasted dates, it might be well remembered that from 1871
onward to 1889, with only a single slight check in 1887, the growth of the maize

acreage has been continuous. From 1889 to 1894 fluctuations were reported

yearly, ending in the latter year at a total acreage no higher than that of 1880, but
returning again in a single year, if the record can be trusted, to the highest point

reached. The wheat acreage movement has been more irregular, and the latest
figures are complicated by the admitted corrections which were made to an
amount of 5,000,000 acres for too low previous estimates in 1897. Allowing for
this, the regular upward movement of the wheat acreage was apparently checked
in 1880, and has only begun again since 1898 under the stimulus of higher prices in

that year.

     In live stock the development would seem to have been arrested altogether
between 1885 and the end of the century in the case of cattle, and turned into an
absolute decline in the number of sheep and swine, although in the fifteen years
before 1885 cattle had increased more than 71 per cent., swine 74 per cent., and

sheep 25 per cent. As a matter of fact the maximum number of cattle was reached
in 1892, when the numbers were 54,000,000, or ten millions more than at present,

the stock of swine declining in a still greater ratio from the same year, and sheep
declining and rising again in the separate periods between 1883 and 1889, and
between 1893 and 1897. If the ratio under each head to population is considered,
it would appear that the United States possessed 661 cattle lor every 1,000 of her
citizens in 1870. This was raised to 829 per 1,000 persons in 1885, while the ratio

now has fallen again below the starting-point, or to 604 per 1,000 persons. Sheep
have fallen in the thirty years from 1,060 in 1870 to 880, and now to 537 head

only per 1,000 inhabitants. These remarkable changes are worthy of note in
connection with the exports of living animals and animal products, which last have
been maintained at a still higher level than before.

     Turning to a country of nearly stationary population, provided for in the main
from its own agricultural produce with only slight assistance from abroad, a like con-
trast for the beginning, the middle, and the end of the period under review will

give roughly the results shown below. Here, although we are provided with an

higher average yield, which is nearly 5 bushels per acre greater in France than in
America. Taking wheat and rye together, there are a million acres less of bread
corn grown in France than there was when her slow-moving population was two
millions smaller, or less than 58 acres to 100 persons now as against 60 acres to
the 100 twenty-eight years ago.

ment of price in recent years, the slight apparent decline 1 have shown in the

cultivation of oats is in fact confined to Ireland, the area in Great Britain bein?

greater than at the beginning of the period. The cattle stock of the United
Kingdom is increased by some 23 per cent., and the swine by about 8 per cent.,
while our flocks of sheep have been maintained at a level far exceedin"- that of
other European States, and distinctive in a peculiar manner of the agriculture of
Great Britain, for they still represent, as it appears, on the average 400 sheep to
every 1,000 acres of land, against 164 iu France, 81 in Germany, 32 in Belgium,
and 17 in the United States.

     Passing to a comparison with another great country, which, like the United

States, is a typical exporter of more than one form of agricultural produce, it may
be asked how far the available statistics of Russia allow such information to be

furnished. For the earliest of the three years contrasted the dates for the Russian
empire are meagre and unsatisfactory. Poland must be excluded as blank in our
statistics at that time, while as regards animals no figures at all would appear to

have been made public for any of the last twelve years. With such qualifications

as these, the available data for the nearest year in the larger crops stood as
under :

be regarded as growing both wheat and rye for export as well as consumption, the
larger proportions of her acreage which is employed in feeding a non-Russian
population deserve to be specially marked in this connection, when the low yields
of both cereals are remembered.

     AVhether the foregoing figures do indeed represent the facts of each period is,
I think, a worthy object of enquiry for some of our younger statisticians, and it is
a problem one would like to see solved as regards this particular country before
venturing on any too confident conclusion as to what is the real meaning of the

changes of the past, and what may be the future position in regard to the growth

of breadstufi's and the growth of population in the world as a whole.
      Calculations, however, such as those just quoted cannot fail to remind the

student how very difierent in productive power the ' acre ' of wheat may be, and
is, in difierent countries. Assuming that we take the existence of 38,000,000 acres

as reported of wheat land in Russia in Europe (e.v Poland) to be proved, a com-
parison of the estimated yields shows that such an area represents less than

12,000,000 acres of the productive power we are accustomed to in Great Britain.

So, too, for the vast wheat area of the United States, it takes two and a third acres

to produce what is now our average yield in this country. Three Indian or three
Italian acres of wheat of the calibre now in use would in the same way be required
to supply the number of bushels that a single acre of our soil in the climate ws
enjoy, and worked under the system of farming that we practise here, would in

ordinary seasons produce. In other extensive areas of wheat-growing the yields,
though greater than the above, are very considerably below our own, the Austrian
Hungarian, and French yields standing at 16, 17, and 18 bushels respectively,
against the 30 bushels which is apparently the average yield of the last five

years in the United Kingdom. Only when we come to very small total areas do
we find instances where the average wheat yields approach or over any consider-
able periods exceed our own. When Denmark, for example, is referred to as

reaching 42 bushels per acre in the season of 1896, it is not to be forgotten that
only a minute area of selected land, in this case only 84,000 acres, is devoted to
this cereal. Results realised on this small scale can hardly be spoken of as an
average in contrast with those of countries where millions of acres are grown, and
can usually be paralleled in some sections of the bigger country.

     Nor should it be forgotten, if the agricultural position of one State be com-
pared with another, how widely the conditions of different parts vary from the
picture presented by the average figures credited to the State as a unit, and how
often sections of one country difler more from each other agriculturally than from
the country with which they are contrasted. AVithin the United Kingdom alone
we are, or ought to be, familiar with essential local differences of this type, which
 have to be kept in mind. Even in respect of the relative density of population
 and the number of mouths to be sustained in a given area, it may be quite correct
 to describe every 1,000 acres in the United Kingdom as carrying on their surface
 on the average 519 persons, but it may be remembered with advantage that,
 considered geographically apart, Scotland, for example, is a country of but 220
 persons, and Ireland of but 219, to the 1,000 acres of area.

      Such a position suggests that it might be fair to draw oiu- agricultural com-
 parisons between Scotland or Ireland as units of area, and such a country as
 Denmark, where the population is 248 to the 1,000 acres. Thus one-third of the
 cereal area of England is still devoted to the growth of wheat, while Denmark has
 but 3 per cent, so occupied, thereby resembling Scotland or Ireland, where some
 4 per cent, only of the corn is wheat. Similarly, on this population basis, Austria

 with 320 persons, or Switzerland with 311, to the 1,000 acres may be not

 inappropriately classed with Wales, where the density is 345. In particular an
 examination of the live stock maintained by each 1,000 acres of the surface in all
 these cases aflords parallels and contrasts which are both interesting and instruc-

 tive. (For table, see p. 835.)

      Thus Wales bear's easily the palm as regards the total stock of sheep
 carried, while Ireland, with a pdpulation practically bearing a similar ratio to that of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F,  835

Scotland to her surface, has more than three times as dense a stock of cattle and
more than eip:ht times as many pipfs, although not much more than half as many
sheep to the 1,000 acres. Although beaten as regards the number of pigs maintained
on a given area by Denmark and by Hungary, Ireland's cattle art? more than twice as
numerous relatively as those of France, where the population is not so very different

in proportion to the soil.

picture of at least the world's wheat crop. For the close comparison of one season
with another much must depend on the sufficiency of the weakest item in the

account, and weakness is sure to creep in somewhere when crops are estimated on
varying systems, at different dates, and on authorities of unequal value. The

definitions adopted by one calculator as to the limits of the ' world ' vary from

those of another, and commercial estimates, as they are called, may be, at the

discretion of the computer, substituted for or adopted in the absence ofofficial data,

so that the guesses at a single country's harvest may differ more widely from each

other than would account for the total margin between one year's aggregate supply
and another, to the confounding of satisfactory conclusions as to what is really

--happening. Last but not least of the obstacles to uniform grouping of harvests in

complete years ending as these years do at different periods-- is the fact, not to
be overlooked, that wheat harvests are being gathered somewhere in every month in

twelve.

     One is driven back then to the attempt to rest opinions on the growth of one
form of culture or another on recorded acreage, rather than assumed production.
Yet even here a good illustration of the difficulty of any extensive compilation

may be found in the tentative memorandum Sir Robert Giffen put before the last
Ivoyal Commission on Agriculture as indicating, with many necessary reservations

and qualifications, the relative movements of grain area, live stock, and population
in the twenty years before 1 893. Briefly, the earlier totals brought into conjunction
for this purpose were made up, as regards the population figures taken to represent
the starting-point of 1873, from the statistics of groups of countries and colonies at
dates for the most part about 1871-3, but in some instances ranging back to 1866
and on to ISSl, and aggregating 365,800,000 persons. Against these were set a

total of 461,800,000 persons, enumerated, for the most part, about 1890-93, but in
a few instances, where later data were wanting, going back to 1880-88, the growth
of population between the totals being 26 per cent.

  --The acreage about 1873 and about 1893, contrasted with these figures, included

wheat, rye, barley, and oats, but not maize a larger crop than any of the last
three. The countries contrasted were limited necessarily by the extent of
information, and the list did not include all of which the population was accounted
for, the increases per cent, being 28 per cent, in the case of oats, 19 per cent, in the
case of wheat, 5 per cent, iu the case of barley, with a decrease of 5 per cent, in
rye. It should be observed, however, that the calculation as to the increase of

wheat would have been much closer to that of population bad not a very large

area, nearly stationary iu amount, been credited to India and Japan at both dates
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the local population of these Asiatic countries being disregarded as, generally
speaking, nou-wheat-eatiner.

     It was only as an outline pointing the direction in which enquiry might be
useful tliat Sir Robert Giffen called attention to these figures, which, as "he acknow-
ledged, were of the roughest possible description, and rather suggestive of a closer
enquiry, which should take account of the difterence between the consumptive
power of the countries aggregated, the varying productive power of nominally
equal areas of surface, and the varying type of live stock maintained.

    If the wheat acreage table, in the memorandum referred to, is examined in

detail, a very effective picture of the difficulty of exact comparison as between
any two given dates is incidentally presented. Out of twenty-four countries
euumerated (including Canada and Australasia as units) a twenty or twenty-one
years' comparison is only really effected in five cases-- Russia, the United States,
France, United Kingdom, and Australasia. In five other instances the period
dealt with is only from seventeen to eighteen years ; in three other cases only
fourteen or fifteen years. In Canada, Egypt, and Denmark, the comparison will
be found to be more limited still, and only to cover eleven or twelve years ; while
in the Argentine Republic, where the recent expansion of wheat-growing has been
prominent, tlie available statistics allowed only of a comparison of two periods, no
more than nine years apart. For seven other countries the wheat acreage was
necessarily either omitted or inserted as presumably the same at both the'earlier

and the later date. Had the retrospect been confined to the cases where a twenty
TRANSACiTIOXS OF SECTIOIS F.  837

--or twenty-one yeafs' comparison was possible and these, after all, included the
--most important and typical wheat-growing communities the increase would have

 stood, not at 19, but at 24 per cent., or scarcely below that of the growth of
population generally. This result is reached without taking account of any South
American figures, where the increase of area is relatively much greater, or of
those of India, where the comparison is difficult and the acreage growing but

slightly. But, further, it is to be remeaibered that if the comparison of the

memorandum were to be continued up to 1899, instead of stopping at 1893, the
figui'es would have shown that wheat-growing had apparently made a new start
in the five important countries for which the long comparison was possible, as
many million acres having been added in the past six years as in the whole pre-

--ceding twenty a result which may aff'ord much occasion for suspending our haal

judgment and no little warning of the danger of single-year contrasts.
     Since the above calculations were before the Commission there has been an

extension of 10,000,000 acres in the official estimates of wheat areas in the United
States, and 5,400,000 acres in Kussia, while, although official details are still
wanting beyond 1895 for Argentina, nearly 3,000,000 acres more were in that
year accounted for in that republic ; and there is an impression, apparently well

founded, that by the present time the total may have reached 8,000,000 acres, or

nearly five million acres more than the final figure in Sir Robert Giff'en's calcula-
tion. If anything like 20,000,000 acres have thus been added to the wheat-
growing surface of the globe in the last five or six years, which these further

figures suggest, even if no correction be made for the Indian quota, there may
be much less difference than was suggested in the memorandum between the growth

of population and wheat-growing.

     Without attempting in any way to controvert what was one of the lessons of
the memorandum I have bean examining, as to the tendency to increase the

numbers of cattle at a ratio above that of population, it has also to be remembered

that the apparent 37 per cent, increase there shown between 1873 and 1893 may

have to be discounted by subsequent deductions in the United States, in Aus-
tralasia, and at the Cape in recent years ; while it is one of the problems I have

never yet seen satisfactorily answered, why in almost all old countries except our
own the diminution of the stock of sheep seems continuous and remarkable. I

mention these matters only, however, to suggest the amount of uncertainty which
must attend the efforts to arrive at conclusions, made even by the highest authori-
ties, on the only data which exist. If there is, as I have shown, such uncertainty
still in the facts on which a conclusion could be built as to the past history of the
relative growth of live stock, or of cereal culture and the supply of bread -stufl^s,
how much greater must the difficulty be of those who attempt, on the basis of
such data, to forecast the course of events for a generation yet to come ! I confess

I am not intrepid enough to follow some of the conjectures which have been

hazarded on this point, and can only, in concluding this address, recur once more

my --to the prime qualifications for safe statistical deductions with which I opened
       remarks redoubled caution in handling calculations, a very guarded use of
data giving records of single and isolated years, and a wise reservation in any
prophetic pictures of the future of agricultural production, whether of wheat or
cotton, in meat or in wool, of the contingency, alwaj's present, of altered con-
ditions which ever and anon in the past have altered and falsified the predictions

of earlier observers.

3. Foundation and Birth-rate, viewed from the historico-statisticalstandpoint.

  By Marcus Rubin, Director of the Royal Danish Bureau of Statistics.

    As is well known, it has become more common than formerly for historians to
seek the help of statistics to support, as far as may be, with observations of groups,
those scattered records which frequently give misleading results. A not un-

important part of the investigations undertaken, and of the tracts, &c., published by

the author outside his official reports, have been concerned with historico-statis-

--tical investigations. One of the earliest of them-- published in 1882 was con-

cerned with the question of the number of the inhabitants of Copenhagen in the

seventeenth century, an inquiry based on the records of baptisms in the church
registers for that century. The paper offers an extension of the discussions of
principle to which that inquiry gave rise.

     The chief question to be answered is the following: As.sumingthat the number
of baptisms at some period in the past can be a.scertained for a town or a country,
how can its population be deduced from that number ? As a rule the registers

give information only of baptisms, not of still-births. In general, at any rate in
Denmark, children were baptised as soon as possible after birth, so that the

numbers not baptised may rather be compared with the still-born of later times.
Given the number of baptisms at some period in the past, this number must first

be subjected to an addition before it can be compared with the record of births of

recent times (living births and still-births). At the beginning of the present cen-

tury the still-births were some 8 per cent, of those born alive. Thus to find the
number of births of the earlier times at least 8 per cent, must be added to the
number of baptisms. Having obtained this datiun, what multiplier will yield the

total of the population.^ This is dependent on whether people in former times

married earlier than now ; further, on whether marriages were more fruitful

and, finally, on whether the number of illegitimate births was greater.

     It is quite clear that if, in comparison with the population, more children were
born in preceding centuries than nowadays, the multiplier must be made less than

would serve now to deduce population from births, and vice versa. Unfortunately,

the old Danish church registers contain no record of the ages at marriage, but one

may assume that people married earlier than at present, because such a course was

in agreement with the needs and wishes of the time, whether considered from the

point of view of State, of Church, or of public opinion.

     I have secured information on this point from the records of a census of Den-
mark in the year 1787, which exist in the Danish Statistical Bureau, but have not

--been published hitherto. This census proves the following both for town and

country : In former times the well-to-do and independent section of the population

mari'ied earlier than now, while the masses married later. This is a consequence

of the fact that the labouring classes were not then free as now, but boarded in

their master's house, and for this and other cognate reasons were obliged to delay

marriage                                            whereas  nowadays  they need  not wait ;  indeed  they often  find  advan-
                                                 ;

tage in marrying young. The more well-to-do, on the other hand, married as

soon as they could, since in old days people did not take our modern views in

social matters, but regarded it as both the right and the duty of men (and of
women) to marry as soon as law and custom made it possible. But, further, not

merely did all marry as soon as they might, but they married as often as might be,

i.e., tbere were fewer widows and widowers than in our time, since none who
could marry remained unmarried. To sum up, on the average the age of marriage
was higher than in our time, because the masses were compelled to postpone

marriage, but in spite of this the number of marriages was greater, partly because

the well-to-do married earlier than now, partly because the masses married, almost
without exception, as soon as they could, and, further, partly because the widowed

remarried in far greater proportion than now.                                      The statistical proof of the fact is
given in the paper, where it is also shown
nowadays to that which occurred formerly.                                         that precisely the opposite happens
masses early.'
                                                                                  Now the well-to-do marry late, the

Although, on the average, marriages were later than now, yet the number

                                                                       ' See Table I.
                           TRANSACTIOKS OF SECTION P.              839

of cliildren to a marriage was at least as great as in our time. In Oul' time the
fertility of marriage is determined partly by physical, partly by social causes.

Formerly the fertility of marriage was as great as nature permitted, just as
marriage was undertaken as freely as the law and the economic development of the
community permitted, not as nowadays, when people remain unmarried though
not restrained by the fact of being unable to afford it. In spite of the marriages
taking place later on the average, the fertility of marriage was not less than now.

This position is established in the paper by means of statistics.
AFinally comes the question of illegitimacy.
                                              result of the masses being com-

pelled to defer wedlock to a later age than now was that the number of illegitimate

births was greater than in our time. This cannot be proved directly, but the

paper shows, by the use of modern statistics, how the number of illegitimate
children increases as the age of marriage among the masses increases. I am

confident that the rule can be laid down for Denmark that in former times, both

within and without the bonds of wedlock, more children were born relatively to

the population than in our own time. The tendency towards a diminished birth-
rate which can be shown for our time (and is demonstrated in the paper) did not

exist of old. That the population did not increase was due, not to a small natality,

but to a great mortality, as is also shown in the paper.

    When the number of the baptised in former centuries is determined, a smaller

factor must be used with which to multiply it, in order to deduce the population,
than would be appropriate for our time. If the number of baptisms in former

times be multiplied by 30, the numbers of the population will probably be

determined to within 10 per cent, of excess or defect.
     The following tables illustrate some of the more important facts to which

allusion is made :

1 . Results of Experimental Work in Agriculture in Canada under Govern-

    ment Organisation. By William Saundeks, LL.D., Director of

     Canadian Experimental Farms.

     For some years prior to 1884 agriculture in Canada was in a depressed condition,

and during that year a Select Committee was appointed by the House of Commons

to inquire into the best means of encouraging and developing the agricultural in-
dustries of Canada.

     From the investigations of this Committee it was shown that farming in
Canada was at that time in a very defective condition, that there was a lack of

thorough tillage, that no sufficient measures were taken to maintain the fertility
of the soil, that there was a want of knowledge in regard to rotation of crops, and
of the selection of improved varieties of seed that lack of information existed

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

also in reference to many of the principles underlying the successful rearing of

stock, the manufacture of dairy products, and the grosving of fruit.
     This Committee recommended that the Government establish an Experimental

Farm where experiments mig^ht be carried on in connection with all branches of

agriculture, horticulture, and arboriculture, and that the results of these experi-
ments be published from time to time and disseminated freely among the farmers
of the Dominion.

     In 1886 an Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada authorising the
Government to establish a Central Experimental Farm and four Branch Experi-
mental Farms in different parts of tlie Dominion, and during the two years
following these farms were established and set in operation.

     The results of twelve years' experience have shown that these institutions have
been highly beneficial to the farming community. Experimental research has
been carried on along the lines prescribed by the Act by which these farms were
established, and much information has been accumulated and distributed freely to
the farmers of Canada in reports and bulletins. Benefits have thus been con-
ferred on Canadian farmers in connection with all the more important farm crops,
in the development of the stock and dairy industries, in the production of fruits,
in the growing of trees for shelter and timber, and in the advancement of other

branches of arboriculture.

     Much attention has been given to experiments relating to the maintenance of

the fertility of the land, to the best methods of cultivating the soil, to a proper
rotation of crops, to the best time for sowing, and the selection of the best and
most productive varieties for seed.

     By freely spreading the information gained, supplemented by a liberal distri-

bution of samples of the best and most productive cereals, crops have been im-
proved, and the attention of farmers generally awakened to the importance of
adopting such measures as will result in increased crops. The steady advance-
ment which has taken place within recent years in Canada, and the increasing

prosperity of agricultural industries, may in large measure be attributed to the
useful work of these Experimental Farms established and maintained by the

Government in different parts of Canada.

2. The Economic Possibilities of the Growth of Sugar Beet in England. By

     A. D. HalLj M.A., Princiiyal o/ the South- Eastern Agricidtural Col-
      lege, Wye.

     The sugar beet can be grown successfully in the south and east of England
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

the yield of sugar per acre is equal, if not superior, to the yield in other countries,
where the industry is conducted on a large scale.

     The economic question of the value of the industry is confused by bounties and

ditties ; it 13 therefore necessary to ascertain the possible profit of the crop at the

price of sugar which prevails in the open British market. It is also desirable to find

the value of the crop for consumption on the farm, pending the general establish-

ment of factories to deal with the roots grown in each district.

In 1898 a series of trials was carried out on farms in various parts of the

country                                   the average yield per  acre  was  loi  tons of unwashed  roots.                                              This figure
                                       ;

is probably                               too  high, if roots with a   high sugar content  are grown                                                   in  the  same
                                                                                                                                                    ;

year the average yield of six German estates, where an intensive system of cultiva-

tion is practised, was only 10'7 tons of washed roots per acre.

In 1898 six diflerent kinds of sugar beet were grown upon the farm of the

South-Eastern Agricultural College at Wye, Kent, the crop being managed in the

same manner as the adjacent mangold break ; the average yield per acre was

14 tons of unwashed roots, as against 29 tons of mangolds. The sugar content

was highly satisfactory, the season heing one of prolonged warmth : it is calcu-

lated that about 1^ ton of sugar per acre could have been extracted, representing

a gross return of 18/. 10s.

     In several respects the crop is more expensive to grow than mangolds ; manure
and cultivation were found to cost 10/. 8s. per acre, to which rent, supervision, and

all incidental charges must be added.

The roots grown were stored with the mangolds until spring, and given,

together with cake and corn, to two selected lots of sheep, with the general result

that each sheep consumed C.3 lb. of sugar beet per week, against 140 lb. of

mangolds, and that the increase in live weight was 30-0 per cent, with beet and

37-2 per cent, with mangolds. Recalculating on a basis of acreage required: ten-

elevenths of an acre of sugar beet will provide the same amount of succulent food for

sheep as an acre of mangolds, and will supply 38 sheep for 12 weeks ; the sheep on
mangolds will, however, make 293 lb. greater increase in live weight. The

experiment showed that the beet forms an indifferent fodder for sheep.

Turning to the general question of the return to the farmer, the average price

paid in 1898 in the six selected German cases mentioned above was 19s. 6d. per

ton for roots delivered at the factory.

Assuming from the 1898 experiments an average English production of 14 tons

of dressed roots per acre, the gross return to the farmer at the above price would
be 13/. 13i!. The cost of cartage from the factory to the farm must be taken into

account: it is estimated that the 3,000 acres of suo:ar beet which Lawes and

Gilbert specify as required to maintain a factory would mean an average distance
from farm to factory of four miles, the cartage over which distance would cost

about 30s. per acre for the 14-ton crop. When this is added to the cost of

cultivation and an allowance made for rent, &c., there is no margin left for the

farmer from the gross return of 131. 13s. per acre set out above.
     The 19s. 6d. per ton for roots is a price that is not possible in this country, the

price payable for the raw material being dependent on the price of sugar. Taking

similar grades of sugar, the return received by the German manufacturer was in

January 1900 13s. per cwt., while the price in England was lis. 3d. per cwt.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

a difference of 35s. per ton of sugar. As 7i tons of beet are required to produce

a ton of sugar, this difference in the price of the finished product is equivalent to a

reduction of 4s. 8d. per ton in the price payable for roots.

     The English figures, then, become : Average yield per acre, 14 tons price
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

The success of the sugar beet industry depends upon several factors :

(1) Cheap technical skill in the factories.

A(2) farming community working for smaller returns than prevail in Britain.
A(3) system of bounties and countervailing duties.

noting

             The Black Death, some of its results.
             The depreciation of the coina2:e under Henry VIII. and its effects.

            Competition the farmer has now to maintain (i.) in the market for labour

                  with manufacturing operations, and (ii.) in the produce market with

                     foreign supplies of food.

     2. Three tables derived from replies to a form of questions attached to the

--paper and sent to certain farmers of my acquaintance. These show :

           (a) An increase in the amount of land laid down to permanent pasture.
           {b) An increase in the wages paid for the several kinds of piecework

                          concomitant with

           (c) An increase in the weekly wages paid for all kinds of agricultural

                               labour.

     3. Notes on these replies, and conclusion.

         4. Trade Fluctuations. By John B. C. Kershaw, F.S.S.

     The author stated that this subject had attracted in the past the attention of
many minds, especially in times of commercial depression, and that the records of
the Koyal Statistical Society and of the Economic Section of the British Association
proved that the members of these two learned bodies had not neglected to under-
take their share in this investigation. But though some of the keenest minds in
the realm of economic science had attempted to discover the laws which govern
trade fluctuations, these phenomena of the industrial and financial world were still

largely unexplained.

     The currency, protection, free trade, war, famines, labour disputes, trade
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                _

unionism, radical governments, and sun-spots had been advanced at one time or
another as chief causes of the periodic depressions from which British trade suffers.
Each of these explanations had, however, on examination proved unsatisfactory
and insufficient to account for the fluctuations revealed when the trade figures over
a long period of years were subjected to scrutiny in the light of the particular

theory.

One theory, however, had seemed to the author worthy of further examination

and inquiry, and for some months he had been collecting statistics bearing upon it.

The theory was that first advanced by Sir William Herschel, and supported in

--a qualified manner at a later date by Giffen,' Jevous,- and Binns.^  Briefly

summarised it was as follows :

    Normal trade between any two countries when reduced to its ultimate compo-
nents was seen to be simply au exchange between the commodities which they pro-
duced. The countries of the world might be roughly classified as those in which the
produce is chiefly that of the soil, or in which it is chiefly that of the hand and
brain. The agricultural labourer and the skilled mechanic were therefore the repre-
sentative human units of the two great divisions of employment, and all commerce
was merely the exchange or barter of the products of their activities. The volume of
trade must consequently be dependent upon the volume of crops if this theory of

commerce be correct ; and a series of bad harvests, using that term to cover every

product of tlie soil, must sooner or later have their effect upon the trade in manu-

factured goods.

     The trade statistics dealt with related to the value and volume of the exports
of the United Kingdom for a period of forty-three years ; and statistics relating to
the total world crops of cotton, wheat, and sugar had been sought, with only par-
tial success, for the same period.

     These three agricultural products were selected because they are those upon the
ample provision of which British industrial activity and prosperity appeared most
largely to depend. The period 1856-1898 was selected because during these years
British export trade had experienced most severe fluctuations, and also because the
nearer one approached to the end of tbe century, the more reliable and complete
were the statistics relating to trade and crops.

     The figures collected by the author in the course of his inquiry, with full infor-
mation as to their source, were given in an appendix to the paper; and for the pur-
poses of comparison they had been thrown into diagrammatic form, which was

distributed at the meeting.

     The curve showing the volume of our export trade year by year since 1857 was
marked by dips in 18(30-62, 1873, 1876, 1885, 1891-93, and" in 1897-98.

     The curve showing the volume of the sugar crop of the world whs marked by
dips in 1861, 1864, 1868, 1872, 1875-77, 1880, 1886, 1888, 1896, and in 1898.

     The curve showing the volume of the cotton crops of the four leading producinj^
countries since 1870 was marked by dips in 1872-73, 1877-79, 1882, 1884-85,
1889, 1893, and in 1896.

     The curve showing the volume of the wheat crops of the world since 1876 was
marked by dips in 1879, 1883, 1885, 1888-89, and in 1895-97.

     Finally a compounded curve showing the total crops of cotton, wheat, and
sugar since 1876 was marked by dips in 1879, 1885, 1888-89, 1893, and in

1896-97.

      In conclusion the author claimed that the theory of a connection between trade
fluctuations and agricultural prosperity found support in the figures he had pre-

sented. Many causes no doubt combined to produce trade depressions, the mental

--mood of bankers and capitalists so ably discussed by Mr. John Mills before the

--Manchester Philosophical Society in 1867 being one of these, and sudden change

in foreign tariffs another. But the cause discussed in the author's paper was not
less important, and when fuller statistics relating to wheat were available he
hoped to continue his investigations.^

  2. Municipal Building for the Overcrowded. By Auberon Herbert.

    We can supply this want either by the system of free trade, which has done so

much for us, or by enlarging once more the area of compulsion. The real question

is then: Is compulsion a good or a bad thing? Undotibtediy it is easy and cou-

--venient ; but does it not tend to bring serious evils with it disagreement, care-

less and expensive management, corruption ? does it not make children of us,
cpoiling the temper of compeller and compelled ?

    Let us see how the land lies. Looking round at Europe to-day we see a

general failure of highly organised systems of compulsion. Writers of different
schools complain that parliamentary institutions are breaking down. Almost
everywhere minorities are in revolt against majorities. They obstruct, prevent

discussion, and lock the machine. Once we hoped great things from the system of
majorities and minorities. The sting was to be extracted from human disagree-
ments, and we were to live side by side in a happy family. Unfortunately men
have discovered that majorities are very keen to pursue their own particular
interests ; that to be in a minority means to lose all control, perhaps for many
years, over one's own mind, body, and property, and that the ingenious precept

that it is the duty of minorities to turn themselves into majorities, and so to

--possess the promised land, is rather like the nursery maxim jam yesterday, jam

to-morrow, but never to-day.

    AVhy has the governing machine failed ? Partly because men are not
scrupulous enough to possess this power over each other, and spend the money
of others on their own pet projects partly because the game of politics accustoms

                                                                                                                                                                     ;

--us to the use of crooked weapons partly because compulsion destroys competition
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and disfavours difference ' Progress is difference,' said Spencer, condensing a
whole philosophy of life into that short sentence, and packing enough moral

--dynamite into it to upset a good many comfortable armchairs and partly because

the human race, keen to get its business done for it on such easy terms, and

entirely forgetting the narrow limits of brain-power in these days of accumulated
knowledge, has piled such a monstrous amount of work on the governing machines.
The consequence is that Governments, overpowered by details and lost in a flood of

useless paper-work, cannot control their own work ; and the people cannot control
their Governments, or even understand what is done in their name. The vastness,
the multifarious character, the ever-extending range of what is undertaken, render
ignorance compulsory on all of us, and we all, representatives and represented, go

stumbling and blundering on together, attempting to do the impossible.

      Just as it is with the big central machine, so it is with the smaller local

machines. The same ambition to undertake everything and to play the part of
earthly Providence, to be all-wise and all-directing ; the same strife between parties,

with the same handing over of the minds, the bodies, and the property of all to the

--victorious section are producing the same results. What a chronicle of ex-

travagance and corruption has met our eyes in many cities of other countries !
what violent partisanship in the Paris and Vienna of the present hour ! what

organised illegality in New York ! what desperate remedies in the suspensions of

the right to govern themselves in the cities of America !

     What is the remedy? Let our municipal bodies develop a voluntaryist side to

their work. Instead of always compelling, let them sovaQtvaies persuade us to help
them in some of their many duties. In this very matter let them appeal to us to

We cannot go on for ever slipping and sliding against our will into Socialism ; we

--must learn to meet great wants in better fashion the fashion of men who are not

compelled. Then the new wants of civilisation will prove to be our best educa-

long as we satisfy every new want by the easy and idle methods of compulsion, we

learn nothing, for compulsion leaves all faculties undeveloped and only deepens

the causes of strife.

 3. Recent Changes affecting the Legal and Financial Position of Local

              Authorities in E7igland. By F. W. Hirst, B.A.

    Changes in our Local Government Law may be produced in four distinct

ways :

    1 By Act of Parliament, private or public.
    2. By decisions of the Courts, i.e. changes of interpretation.
    3. By orders and regulations.
    4. By bye-laws.

     With regard to the third heading it may be pointed out that there are draw-

backs as well as advantages in connection with the central control exercised by

departments like the Local Government Board, Home Office, and Board of Trade

over the Local Authorities. The system of auditors is a good example of a form
of administrative control which is wholly advantageous. But other forms of
control involve administrative law, and both Parliament and the Courts are justly
jealous of interference by bureaucratic boards which sit in London with the
free play of representative local councils. In the case of Kreese v. Johnson, the
late Lord Chief Justice held that Justices should be slow to invalidate a bye-law

made by a local representative body. Ou the other hand the Private Street
Works Act of 1892 substitutes Magistrates for the Local Government Board in

appeals against apportionment.

     Perhaps the development of Local Government by judicial decisions has been
most marked of late years in the spheres of rating and drainage law. In the first,
the recent case of Cartwright r. Sculcoates Union deserves particular attention.
It follows, I think, from the important decision of the House of Lords in that case

that the rent of a tied public-house is legally worthless as evidence of its rateable

value, and that evidence of the business actually done on the premises not only

may be, but ought, in such cases, to be obtained.
     As regards public bill legislation there is no more interesting study than

the rules by which Parliamentary Committees are, or ought to be, guided in dealing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,

with applications for borough extension. This is a subject well understood and

practised by Bradford, which is also a pioneer municipality iu consolidating rating-
areas and placing the levying and collection of rotes under the control of the

--Urban Authority a reform much to be desired in the interests of good govern-

ment and public economy. Another kindred subject is the extension of
municipal industry by Private Acts. Lastly, it may be well to pass in review
 some of the more important measures which have been placed on the Statute-book

 during the last ten years, including, besides those already mentioned, the Light

 Railways Act of 1897, the Highways and Locomotives Amendment Act of 1898,
the Isolation Hospitals Act of 1893, the Parish Councils Act of 1894, the Agricul-
tural Rates Act of 1890, and the London Government Act of 1899.

          1. AiTiierican Currency Difficulties in the Eighteenth Century.

                             By W. Cunningham, D.D.

    To many Englishmen it is a matter of surprise that currency questions should

be such prominent political issues in the United States at the present time, and
it is instructive to remember that debates about the circulating medium were as

common there in the eighteenth century as they are to-day. There has always
been, as it seems, a considerable body of colonists or citizens who have believed

that existing monetary conditions had been devised in the interest of some par-
ticular class, and that it was right and fair to manipulate the currency so that it
should be more favourable to the interests of their own class or district. These
efforts have generally resulted in depreciation of some kind.

     1. The American Colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had
practically no coinage of their own, and there was great difficulty in maintaining
the right standard of weight among the Spanish coins which formed the ordinary
currency. The clipping and sweating of the coin was ^·ery common, and was even
connived at by the authorities. In 178:3, when Congress obtained a loan from
France, it seemed absurd to let the heavy coins get into circulation, and Mr.
Timothy Pickering was ordered, much against his will, to get ' a pair of good
shears, a couple of punches, and a leaden anvil ' for the work. If he had difficulty
in the business he was referred to the Paymaster-General of the Forces, who was
suppo.sed to know all about it.

     2. There have of course been various examples of the depreciation of the

currency by the over-issue of paper in Massachusetts in 1740, in 1779, when a
suit of clothes cost ^2,000 in Continental paper, and in 1786, when attempts to

circulate the bills of Massachusetts, Rhode Islaud, and New Jersey gave rise to

much trouble.
     3. There were few facilities for mining in America, and the issue of debased

coin was impracticable; but the separate colonies, both on the mainland and the
islands, had recourse to the expedient of raising the rating at which the coins in
circulation should be accepted, so as to give each piece of money a greater nominal
value, and temporarily at least a greater purchasing power. This can apparently
be practised with success in a country where business is practically done by barter,
or with commodity money, or where prices are the subject of authoritative assess-
ment. All these conditions were largely present in the colonies in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. The object of a colony in enliancing the coinage and
thus lowering all prices, was to attract silver from its neighbuurs, so that there

might be more currency within its own area, and some relief i'rom the inconveni-

ences of barter. In 1698 Pieces of Eight were suddenly raised in Pennsylvania
from six shillings to pass for seven shillings and eightpence. This involved a loss

of nearly 30 per cent, on the tobacco duty when the cost of collection was defrayed.
The variations were frequent and considerable, and were said to be due to ' the
contrivance of some designing men in those countries who engross it when at the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  847

lowest, and so make mercliandise of it and export it into foreign parts.' At all
events it gave rise to a sort of currency war between the colonies, each trying to
draw away the circulating medium trom others to itself. Thus about 1740
Virginia was attracting money from Maryland, and in 1798 the West Indian
Islands set about establishing what Mr. Chalmers calls ' retaliatory ratings ' against

each other on a considerable scale.
     It would be interesting to follow out the probable results of this method of

manipulating the currency ; immediately they would be precisely opposite to the
consequences of debasing the issues from the mint. Debasing the coinage means
a rise of prices ; enhancing the coin is a lowering of prices all round : it does not
increase the quantity of money in circulation ; and while debasing the currency
renders the exchanges unfavourable, the object of enhancing- the coin is to attract
bullion to the country. In so far as quantities of bullion were secured, there would
of course be subsequent readjustments, but the immediate results would be very
different from those of debasing the currency, except in one particular. Both
methods of manipulating the currency would mean that creditors must accept

smaller quantities of silver in satisfaction for existing debts.

     This last does not appear to have been the motive of the Governments at the
time ; they seem to have been actuated by a reasonable desire to attract currency
or prevent a drain of coinage, and to have pursued their aim by a method of very
questionable honesty, but well calculated, under the circumstances, to attain the
wished-for result. The conditions under which ' enhancing the coinage ' can be

successfully practised so as to influence internal prices are unlikely to recur in the
business communities of the world ; and there is little motive to have recourse to

it, since it yields no immediate gain to a Government ; but there is at least a

scientific interest in noting bow this method of manipulating the currency
TTorked in a state of business relations with which many of us are unfamiliar.

2. Some Economic Consequences of the South African War. By L. L. Price.

     There is a tendency to attach an unreal importance to divisions of time like

those parting one century from another ; but the end of the nineteenth century is

accompanied by a series of remarkable events. At the beginning of the century

England was engaged in the Great War with Napoleon, which, in addition to

direct influence on the finances of the country, postponed the progress of fiscal

reform, caused the suspension of cash payments, assisted the alarming growth of
pauperism, aggravated the evils of the early Factory System, and was followed by

prolonged depression. The South African War, with which we have been occu-

pied at the close of the century, is not, so far as its direct financial consequences

are concerned, an economic event of the same magnitude. AVar is indeed more
costly now, but the duration of the war with the Boers will bear no comparison

with the twenty years of the Napoleonic contest. It may occasion a considerable

permanent increase in military expenditure ; but the sums involved in the two cases,
taken absolutely, are very difierent, and, measured by the material resources of the
nation, the earlier figure was enormous, while the later is trifiing. The increased

military expenditure may be accounted, on a strict interpretation of the term,
' unproductive,' and the growing pressure of foreign competition in our own manu-

factures and trade, coupled with the increasing cost of obtaining the coal which is

still the source of much motive power, and the large additions made to local and
municipal indebtedness, may render it desirable to husband resources and avoid
augmentation of the National Debt. The Transvaal, however, will bear part of the
direct expenditure of the war, and, even when the indirect burden is brought into
the account, the total weight may be described as inappreciable, contrasted with
the strain imposed by the Great War. But some of the possible economic effects
of the later contest deserve attention ; for it has been a disturbiug factor, which
may supply the force needed to more the currents of action from a groove in which

they had settled. Passing by some obvious immediate consequences to the labour
market and to trade, three points demand especial notice.

      (1) In the first place, the influence of an increaSe'd output from the mines of
848 EEPORT-- 1900.

the Eand should be seeu in a rise of gold prices. This is difficult to bring to

quantitative measure, and prediction may prove deceptive. Sir Eobert Gitfen

foretold, in 1894, that the fall of gold prices was ended ; but in 1897 he confessed

that his expectations were not yet realised. By the present time, however, the

evidence of index-numbers, such as that of Mr. Sauerbeck, seems to show a rise

beyond any movement due to credit, in spite of the temporary cessation of supplies

from the Transvaal. But past experience enjoins caution in any estimate. The

percentage of increase in the output is at present much less than it was at the

Australian and Californian discoveries in the middle of the century. Predictions

made at that time, even by a competent scientific observer like Jevons, were dis-

appointed ; and, although the * compensatory action ' of the bimetallic mint at
Paris, which then acted as a ' parachute ' to break the fall in the value of gold, is

now absent, yet the normal counteracting causes, such as the increased use of the
metal in the currencies of the world (apart from any special new demands), the

great growth of trade and industry, and the influence of credit, have become more

Apowerful.  rise of gold prices may be expected ; but it is impossible to fix the

point which it will reach. Its consequences will be beneficial, and may assist in

solving unsettled monetary questions.

     (2) The aid rendered by the colonies to the mother country in the war is
likely, in the second place, to increase the momentum behind the conception of an

Imperial ZoUverein. There are special difficulties attending a Cuscoma Union of

the British Empire, arising from the separate situation of its component parts,
which have not presented themselves in the case of Germany or the United States.

These difficulties may, or may not, be eventually overcome; but some general con-
siderations, apposite to the question, may be submitted to a scientific gathering
lilve the British Association. Such a Customs Union, while it may conceivably

result in an increase of internal free trade within the limits of the Empire, must,

in all likelihood, involve some difl'erential treatment of foreign goods. It must, so

far infrin"'e the principles of Free Trade strictly interpreted. Recent theoretical

discussion, especially of the incidence of taxation, has weakened some arguments

for Free Trade, but the practical difficulty of limiting your action to what you

really intend, and the great advantage of an attitude of neutrality on the part of

Government in matters of trade, have not been diminished by recent experience.

Yet an economic sacrifice may bo incurred to secure a political end, or a temporary

loss may be risked in the hope of an ultimate gain. The economist will urge that

the step should be taken knowingly, and that its consequences should be seen and

realised. On this ground the more obvious and open action of bounties is to be

preferred to the obscure indirect influence of import duties. Lastly, the economist,

while noting the crude fallaciousness of not a little reasoning, may admit the

weicrht of some arguments employed against Free Trade. He may reach the con-

clusion that the matter must be deeifled mainly on practical grounds, and that
Atheory ends with opening men's eyes to the results of their action.
                                                                      non

posst/mus attitude towards a Customs Union is no longer possible.

(3) A third and last consequence of the South African War, which must be

briefly noted, is its eftect on Socialism. The unity of classes at home, which has

resulted from common interest, is not favourable to class dissension. The increased

militarv expenditure is calculated to prevent or delay the execution of costly social

experiments, although Chancellors of the Exchequer, seeking to broaden the bases

of revenue, may possibly, if improbably, give efl'ect to some socialistic aspirations
of mulcting ' unearned increments.' Yet it may be a sound instinct which draws

a distinction between socialism and militarism.

    Finally, it may be remarked that the consequences of the war thus noted are
certainly not unimportant, if they may seem problematic.

                        3. Colonial Governments as Money-lenders.

                             By Hon. W. P. Keeves.

    For many years high rates of interest have been almost as much complained of

by farmers and graziers in Australia and New Zealand as in the AN'estern States of
       TRANSACTIONS 6¥ SECTION P.     849

America. Forty years ago 15 per cent. ·wa3 commonly paid in the year in interest

and commissions by this class of borrowers. By 1893 this had fallen to from 6 to

--8^ per cent., but the prices of produce had fallen in proportion. In the years

1894-96, the Governments of four colonies New Zealand, South Australia, Western

--Australia, and Victoria established money-lending departments for making ad-

vances on mortgage to the smaller class of farmers. In this way over 4,000,000/. has

already been lent out. Details are given in the paper of 3,600,000/., of which about

New2,200,000/. has been lent in  Zealand, 790,000/. in Victoria, 530,000/. in South

Australia, and 100,000/. in Western Australia. About 450,000/. has already been

repaid. The New Zealand Government raises its loan capital by issuing stock in

London; the others by selling mortgage bonds from time to time locally. In

Victoria, this capital has been obtained at 3 per cent, (from the State Savings

Bank) ; in New Zealand it has cost 3^^ per cent., and in South Australia 3^ per
cent. The rates charged to farmers are in New Zealand 5 per cent. ; in the

--Australian colonies 4| per cent. The fees charged by all the State lending

offices are very low lowest of all in South Australia. The management expenses,

are, however, small also, and the lending would seem at present to have been done

prudently. At any rate, balance-sheets to the end of June 1899 and March 1900

show no losses, while of arrears of interest there were none in New Zealand, and but

a few hundreds in Australia The lending is done by way of first mortgage on

freehold, or on leasehold held from the Crown. The loans are devoted to improving

settlers' holdings, or to paying oft" existing mortgages bearing a higher rate of

interest. In Western Australia they are restricted to the former purpose ; else-

where more than half the money is applied to the latter. The highest sum which
may be lent to one borrower is 3,000/. The proportion of loan to security

must not exceed 60 per cent, of a freehold, or half the selling value in case

of a lease. An interesting feature is the system of repayment of loans by

instalment. Under this the borrower pays 6 or 7 per cent, annually, of which 4|
or 5 represents intere-st, and the remainder goes to form a sinking fund to

extinguish the debt. In New Zealand every loan must thus be repaid by

seventy-three half-yearly instalments. The mortgagee may, however, hasten

the process by depositing additional sums or paying off' the whole principal

·whenever he chooses. In 1899 the Government of New South Wales followed

the example of the neighbour colonies and passed an Advances to Settlers Act.

    As an example of the effect of these Acts in reducing rates of interest, it may

be remarked that in 1894 almost two-thirds of the money of registered mortgages

in New Zealand bore from 6^ per cent, upwards. In 1898 six-sevenths of the mort-

gage money was yielding less than 6^ per cent.

4. Variations of Wages in some Co-jMrtnersMj') Workshops, with some

    Comparisons with Non-Co-operative Iiidustries. By Robert Halstead,

    Secretary of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Centre of the Labour

      Association.

    The difficulty of securing suitable data for the purpose of the paper was con-
siderable, owing to the fact that the kind of information required was very local and
very special. The officials of thirty-four co-operative productive societies furnished
information respecting 4,012 co-operative workers with a total wage of 209,521/.
for the year 1899. Fourteen societies sent replies, the total wages of which
amounted for that year to 122,313/. The average increase of wages in these
co-partnership workshops since 1891 was 9 per cent. Means for comparison with

non-co-operative wages are available for 1899 only, which shows a result in favour
of co-operation of 7 per cent. Co-operative workers also have two hours a week
less than non-co-operative workers. The figures also reveal that a large number of

co-partnership workers were connected with their own trade unions. Particulars

·were supplied by ten societies, in which 246 workers were concerned, and in which
last year the total wages were 9,486/. These showed that the workers had wages
in excess of non-co-operative ones in the same trade and district by 11 per cent.,

1900.                              3
 850 REPORT-- 1900.

 and that tliey worlied one and a half hour a week less. MoreoVet, the loyalty Of
 these workers to trade unionism was shown hy a high percentage of them heing
 memhers of their own trade and district hranches.

      Five co-partnership societies with a total number of workers of 501, and wages
 for 1899 of 23,557^, show an average increase in wages of 17 per cent, since
 1891 ; hut there is no means of comparing this with the wages of non-co-operative

 workers.

      With regard to the five remaining societies little more can he said than that
 they paid more than standard or trade union rate of wages in addition to a share
 of the profit, and that in some cases they worked fewer hours than non-co-operative

 concerns.

      The returns also show that in nineteen cases concerned there was an average
 increase of 11 per cent, from 1891 to 1899, and that in fourteen cases there was
 an average ditference in favour of co-operative as against non-co-operative wages of

 9 per cent.
       This result in favour of co-operation is argued to be due partly to the sources

 from which the facts are obtained, but mainly to the high relative efficiency of co-
 partnership industries. The causes of this efficiency are held to reside in the fact
 that co-partnership brings the workers to more points of contact with the profit-
 making aspect of an industry than ordinary forms of production. Workers in
 co-partnership concerns have a special incentive to obtain higher wages, because

they share in profits in proportion to their wages, thus absorbing as much as

 possible of the results of the extra efficiency due to their special form of
enterprise. The large proportion of the worker being trade unionist is held to
 increase in force, inducing co-partnership societies to take the lead in the matter

of wages.

    5. Labour Legislation for Women. By Margaret E. MacDonald,

     Certain fundamental differences hetween men and women engaged in industry

afl'ect the question of legal regulation.

      {a) Physical differences, e.g., young mothers need special protection from un-

healthy conditions.

     (6) Differences in economic position. Even those women who do not marry are

influenced by the fact that marriage is an event which revolutionises the economic

condition and the industrial outlook of the great majority of women. As the
result, women have a lower standard of pay and work than men. In a large pro-

portion of cases they only need their wages as pocket money, or at most only to
keep themselves, and where they are the breadwinners of the family they are
usually overburdened with household cares and unable to stand out for better con-

ditions. They are comparatively unorganised, e.g., only 116,016 women are re-

turned as mrmbers of trade unions, and of these li '0,470 are in the textile trades.
They are less ready to complain than men ; e.g., in the Post Office women only get
half, or less than half, as much pay as men for the same amount and quality of
work yet the Tweedmouth Commission, while devoting great attention to the

                           ;

grievances of the men, made no recommendations with regard to women, naively
explaining that ' there is a general absence of complaint from them.'

     The comparatively low standard of women's work and pay has an injurious
efi'ect upon men's labour wherever it comes into competition with it ; e.g., the
introduction of light machinery is constantly made the excuse for suhstituting
women for men workers at lower rates. By setting a legal standard the State
compensates to some extent for the lack of organisation and of a high standard
amongst the women.

    "We have experience of lahour legislation for women in certain classes of em-
ployment from 1842 onwards. By comparing the conditions of workers in these

trades before and after regulation, and also comparing their conditions at the

present time in regulated and unregulated trades, we find that in regulated trades:
                                          Transactions op section f.                                                  851

     (1) Sanitary conditions have improved relatively.

    (2) Wages have risen relatively.
    (3) The number of women employed have increased relatively.
     (4) Organisation amongst the workers is more general.

     This study encourages the further extension of legal regulation. In discussing
the details of fresh legislation the following points are to be considered :

           (1) Classes of workers at present unregulated, or very partially regulated,
                    e.g., home-workers, shop-assistants, laundry workers, clerks, &c.'

           (2) Matters for legislation e.g., hours of work, sanitation, dangerous pro-
                     cesses, wages.

        (3) Administration, central v. local authorities, women inspectors.

          (4) Codification of present law, accompanied by differentiation to meet

                     special requirements of special trades.

                                          6. The Treatment of the Tramp and the Loafer.
                                                   By William Haebutt Dawson.

m No time can be more fitting than the present for filling up an important gap
   our penal system and for introducing a reform which became a logical and social

necessity when the Poor Law was placed on its existing basis. The time hat

come for transferring the habitual vagrant and the loafer generally from the

province of the Poor Law to that of the Penal Law. To the former they do not

in any sense belong. The failure of centuries of reformers and legislatures to
make the slightest impression upon the tramp population is largely due to the

persistent mistake of treating his case as coming under the law of public charity.

What society is bound to do, as far as possible, is to exterminate the social

parasite of every kind. His existence is a positive injury to the State in every

way. He robs the State not only of the industry which he owes it, but he

consumes the produce of other people's labour and renders it nugatory, abstracting

premium upon social treason of the most insidious and most vicious kind. Think

what we do for the professional idlers ! Take the urban loafer. While honest

inen are working we give him the free run of our thoroughfares and set apart for
him the best of our street corners. Should he be a vagrant loafer we make it

possible for him to travel through England from the Tweed to the Channel with-

out doing one hour's serious work, save for the labour tests which are imposed by

                                                                                                             should

wonder that our past indulgent treatment of the vagrant has had the effect of

perpetuating and multiplying this class of social parasite ? The dictum of wise

ASir Matthew Hale is still irrefutably true : ' man that has been bred up in the

trade of begging will never, unless compelled, fall to industry.' But that is not

the whole of the truth. Every one of these men creates imitators. On the

highways he is a walking advertisement of the advantages of idleness, while in

the model lodging-house, or wherever else the workhouse-shunning tramp seeks

nightly shelter, he acts the part of recruiting sergeant for the great army of sloth

and vice. What we should do, and shall have to do sooner or later, is

to collect the tramps from the four winds of heaven and try to discipline the

idleness out of their natures. For it is not, in the main at any rate, a dangerous

criminal class with which we have here to do, but for the most part the weak and

aimless characters whose great need is the moral tonic of discipline and compul-

sion. No faith should be placed in any cobbling of the existing Poor Law. No

doubt a good deal more could be done to discourage vagrancy if the separate cell

system were made universal, and if taskwork were rationally imposed ; in a word,

it the regime of the casual ward were made sufficiently rigorous to be deterrent, and

if such rigorous action were made uniform throughout the country ; and finally if
magistrates more consistently enforced the laws against begging, sleeping out, and
similar tramp offences. But this would only be a temporary makeshift, and the
true remedy is to hand these parasites over to the Penal Law. In the first place,
vagrancy and loafing generally should be made indictable offences. The right of

free migration in the case of the destitute should be restricted to the extent of

making it dependent on police permission to travel in search of work, after the
principle of the police pedlar's licence. But, further, the casual ward must be
abolished. This might seem a strong measure, but it is really the fulcrum on
which the lever of reformation must rest. If loafing is to be regarded as an
offence to be punished, instead of an innocent weakness to be humoured, the
loafer's free lodging-house must disappear. The casual ward is entirely incom-
patible with the laws which already exist for the repression of vagrancy. It is
iUegal to beg ; it is illegal to wander about without means of subsistence ; but
there is no habitual vagrant living who is not guilty of this compound fracture
of the law, and few who have not been punished for it. Nevertheless, we wink at
these misdemeanours, and in housing 10,000 vagrants every night in the casual

-- --wards which, of course, is but a fraction of the total highway population we

offer direct encouragement to known law-breakers to persist in breaking the law.
It would, of course, be necessary to meet the case of genuine seekers of work, and
we should meet it considerately and indulgently. They would be expected to
legitimise themselves by means of a police or properly attested private certificate,
asserting their bonajides and destination, and this labour passport should secure
the free right of lodging and food on the way. For them housing might be found

in proper quarters, the workhouse, or any decent house of call, or in night
shelters such as exist in Germany and Switzerland. But the crucial point is,

How to deal with the vagrants and loafers who do not abandon their idle ways

--and seek work ? After a first warning these should be detained for a period

--sufficiently long for disciplinary purposes in correctional institutions; the

hardened cases in penitentiaries to be specially provided for in existing houses of
correction whose regime should be modified to their needs, and the more hopeful

ones in some form of labour colony which, besides receiving vagrants who hod

passed under magisterial jurisdiction, should also, as in Germany, Holland, and
Switzerland, offer a temporary home to work-seekers of all kinds. It might be
said that that was to admit the principle of the right to work. Even if that were
80, the right to work is an infinitely better and wiser and safer principle to
concede to the masses than the right to be idle. Early English laws really
proposed in a crude fashion this very treatment of habitual vagrants and idlers,

--and Germany and Switzerland the one a conservative and the other a democratic
--country are treating the problem on these lines.

   1. The Relation between Spinners and Piecers in the Cotton Industry,

                               By S. J. Chapman, M.A.

     "When spinning first became a separate industry for men at the beginning of this

century the spinners successfully enforced apprenticeship rules ; and even after the

--'mules' and 'jennies' became longer, carrying more spindles especially after
--power was used for driving the carriage backwards and forwards and when con-

sequently more piecers were required on some ' wheels,' the old apprenticeship

rules were still enforced, and a distinction was drawn between those piecers who
were ' learners ' and those who were not. When, however, it became the rule to
have on each machine piecers who were not learners, and when, moreover, im-

proved machinery was rendering the learning of spinning an easy task, the distinc-

tion between piecers and ' learners ' broke down, and the apprenticeship rules could

no longer be maintained. Then the spinners adopted a new policy. They merely

insisted on their existing large share of the total wage paid on the ' mules,' op-

posed all increases in piecers' wages, which they knew would be at their expense,
and limited the quantity of machinery to each spinner. The result is that there
are to-day from two to three times as many piecers as spinners, and that a
great number of the former have been for years as fully qualified as the latter,

though they receive at most only about half a spinner's wage. Both masters and
piecers have attempted to do away with this arrangement, which is by no means
economical, and which benefits only existing spinners at the expense of the piecers
and all future workers in the industry. But the opposition of the piecers is weak
because they are badly paid, and are ever hoping to become soon highly paid

spinners or something else ; and, on the whole, the men have been successful in

resisting the masters' attempts to introduce the 'joining,' ' doffing,' and 'appren-
ticeship ' systems, and the ' coupling of wheels ' (double- and treble-decking), wliicli
were all directed against the existing arrangement of hands on the ' mules.'

2. Indian Guaranteed Railways ; an Illustration of Laisser Faire Theory

                  and Practice. By Ethel R. Faraday, M.A.

The dogmatic rigidity of the laisser faire school, and their refusal to recognise

the principle of development in economics, have produced the characteristic weak-

nesses of their policy, its carelessness of detail, its sacrifice of actual to nominal

freedom, its neglect to provide for future possibilities, and its attempt to apply

the same reasoning                                 to diflerent circumstances                                                                                                    all of which are illustrated      in   the
                                                                                                                                                                              ;

later history of the Indian guaranteed railways. The guarantee system, in origin a

purely practical expedient, had outlived its utility before it was revived by the

English Government of 1868-74, apparently as being preferable, from the laisser

faire point of view, to the direct State ownership which was considered by Lord

Lawrence, as by Roscher, advisable in India. In the contracts renewed with three

--railways--the Great Indian Peninsula, Bombay, Baroda, and Central India, and

Madras lines it was agreed that the companies should receive interest at the

guaranteed rate of 5 per cent, and half the surplus profits, no account being taken

of deficits                                        that remittances  to  England  should                                                                                         be  converted  at  the  rate  of  1».  10^.

the rupee; and that calculations should be made on a half-yearly basis. The

result was that the Indian Government bore all the loss of the unprofitable half-

years and, after 1875, never received its full share of gain in the profitable ones,

since, as the exchange value of the rupee fell below Is. loS., the shareholders received

a gradually increasing proportion of the surplus profits, while the contract obligation

to pay interest at 5 per cent, deprived the State of advantage from cheaper money

and improved credit, which would lately have enabled it to raise money at 2h or

3 per cent, to pay off loans advanced at a higher rate of interest. On the three

lines in question, taken together, the average proportion of earnings yearly

remitted to England, 1892-7, was 99-70 per cent., and the net annual loss to
Government amounted to 13,000,0007^^., a tax imposed on the Indian public, for

the benefit of the British shareholder, by that laisser faire school which objects to

State railways as taxing one part of the community for the benefit of the other.

Statistics showing the working expenses of railways formerly guaranteed, beforo

and after their acquisition by the State, indicate that the guarantee system was

uneconomical ; but the fault is less with the companies than with the laisser faire

English Government, which gave them the material advantages of liberty, and

freed them from its responsibilities.

                    3. Price-changes in the Foreign Trade of France.

                         By Professor A. W. Flux, M.A.

    Some twenty years ago, M. de Foville traced the variations of price-level in
French trade by using for the years 1827 and 1847 to 1862 the values of the
854. REPORT-- 1900.

trade of each year as ascertained and comparing it with the Official Value, which

expressed its value at the prices fixed for the year 1827. From 1862 onwards

these Official Values are not recorded, hut in each year the trade is first valued at
the prices of the preceding year, and, later, a revised valuation, at the prices of the
year itself, is supplied. Thus the price-movements were traced from 1847 to 1878.^
I'he paper continues the latter series of comparisons to 1898. Taking the price-

level of 1862 as 100, the lowest level subsequently reached was in 1897, when
imports reached 57'2 and exports 57'6. In 1898, neglecting fractions, the level
of price for both imports and exports was 58. In the interval the fall of price-
level for exports was almost unbroken, the elevations of 1864, 1872, 1880, and
1890 being comparatively slight. In the case of imports there was a considerable
and sharp rise from 1869 to 1872, after which the course of the movement has
been similar to that of exports, but so much more rapid has been the decline as to
bring the figures for both sections of trade to approximately the same level in the

last few years.
     The piecing together of a record of price-movement before and after 1862 as

ascertained by two different methods gives interest to the comparison of the
measures of the movement from 1887 to 1896 by each of these two methods. The
Tableau Decennalior 1887 to 1896 supplies a valuation of the trade of each year at
1896 prices. The two measures of price-movement give substantially the same
results except in the years most removed from the year with which comparison is
made. The fall of price is greater for exports, less for imports, from 1887 to 1896
as measured by direct evaluation of the trade of each year at the prices of 1896 than
as measured by the index of price-movement previously obtained. The greatest
difference shown falls short of 3 per cent. It is possible that, just as a divergence
between the course of price-movement of imports and exports up to 1872 did not
prevent the substantial identity of price-change in both over the period 1862 to
1898, so the divergence shown over a ten-year period, in the two measures of
price-movement, is no proof that, could the same method have been used for
tracing price-change from 1827 to 1898, instead of two methods linked together at
the date of passing from one to the other, the indication of change of price-level
over the whole period would have differed substantially from that actually

obtained.

     It is interesting to note that the diflerence of price-level in the early sixties and

the late nineties as shown by Sauerbeck's Index Number is not far from the same

as that ascertained by the methods used in the paper for French foreign trade.

                Section G.--MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

  --Peesident of the Section Sir Alexander Binnie, M.Inst.C.E., F.G.S.

                             THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.

      The President delivered the following Address :

 Looking back at the Addresses of my many distinguished predecessors in this

 chair, I find that, devoting their attention as they have done either to the general
 progress of engineering knowledge or to those particular parts of it that have
 engaged their personal study, the possible field of observation has become some-
 what circumscribed. Every one, I think, must by this time be fairly well acquainted

 with the progress made in our work during the present century or during the
 reign of Her Majesty the Queen.

      But although this detailed examination of progressive advancement may appear
 at first sight to be exhausted, yet it may be not altogether unprofitable if we

 endeavour for a few minutes to consider how, and under what circumstances, that
 advancement has alone become possible.

     Living as we do at the end of the nineteenth century, and surrounded as we

 have all of us been from our earliest years with a march of progress unequalled
 in the world's annals, we are apt to assume that the circumstances which surround
 us, the general attitude of the scientific mind, and our conception of nature and
its phenomena, are things which come to us by nature as our birthright, forgetting
 that they are the result of thousands of years of work and thought among some
 of the greatest minds that the world has ever produced.

     It may not therefore be displeasing to the audience which I see before me if
in an imperfect way I attempt to lay before them some, at all events, of the salient

facts which lead up to our present outlook on the scientific matters with which
our profession deals.

   We as civil engineers define our profession as being ' the art of directing the

great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man.' Conse-

quently our success or otherwise will depend on the estimate we may form of

nature as a whole, and of those great sources of power which it places at our
disposal. Undoubtedly in the history of the world there has never been a period
when the study of nature has been so open and free from all prejudices of any kind
whatever as it has been during the present century ; nor, perhaps, with but few
exceptions, has there ever been in any age or country a time when nature and her
laws have been investigated with so pure and steadfast an aim after actual truth
without the mind being prejudiced by authority or preconceived idpas derived
from those great departments of human thought which deal more particularly
with matters of faith, morals, and religion.

     This equanimity of mind in which we now approach all subjects relating to
fciencs has not, J Deed bardJj s(iy, been the case ifl the past. Some persons may

ascribe it entirely to the inductive method introduced by Bacon, as opposed to the

too exclusive confinement of the mind to the deductive systems of the older

scholastic philosophy which preceded his time, and to which in a large measure

he was undoubtedly instrumental in giving the death-blow. This view, however,

is not altogether correct, for in the teaching of Socrates and Aristotle we find

continued reference to the impor ance of inquiry, observation, and induction.

    And in the cases of Hipparchus and Ptolemy in the best days of the Alexandrian

school of astronomy we find the most laborious observations carried on for

hundreds of years under circumstances and with instruments which we should

now consider totally inadequate; and by their means discoveries were then made

with an accuracy which surprises us ; and from these discoveries conclusions were
drawn which for more than a thousand years stood the test and satisfied the

requirements of some of the most acute thinkers of the world.

   We should, I think, in the first instance inquire how it came about that the

great mental energies of philosophers of the ancient world failed to produce that

fruit which we in later ages are gathering in such rich abundance.

To arrive at some idea on this question we must endeavour to picture to our-

selves the inner consciousness of the great minds of antiquity when they first

began to contemplate the circumstances by which they were surrounded, and were

called upon by that inexorable and mysterious longing of the human mind to

answer those great questions of the whence and the whither which are so strangely

rooted in the hearts of all deep-thinking people.

To them were presented for the first time those great phenomena of nature by

which we are always surrounded, many of these being of a character at once to

charm and at other times to terrify the beholder. And in what I may call the
childhood of the human mind, they, like children of a later age, were prone to

ascribe to what they saw around them qualities and properties to which the

phenomena in themselves had no relation.

    What I may call the nascent deductive principle, so strong in all our minds,

had given to it by these ancient philosophers the free play of fancy and imagina-

tion which led them to conclusions based on their own ideas and not upon the

facts of unerring nature. Consequently we see in the early age of Greek thought

the natural laws of the universe in smiling morn or darkening night, in raging sea

or the thunderbolts of heaven, ascribed to the immediate action of benevolent or

malevolent  powers  in  tbe celestial world                                                                        and  as  a  consequence the Greek mind
                                                                                                                ;

from its earliest period became saturated with the beautiful conceptions of her

poets, and following from this when philosophy first approached the subject,

theories were broached and conclusions were adopted, many of them on an utterly

erroneous basis.

Steeped as the Greek mind was in its lovely ideals of nature, it is not sur-

prising to find that, when their philosophers began to formulate their theories,

these deductions took the place of fact ; and celestial observations, when they made

them, as they undoubtedly did, were used, not for the purpose of illustrating the

laws of nature as we interpret them, but as a means, partly religious and partly

philosophical, in support of their preconceived ideas of the universe, the foundations

of which, having been laid in poetry, became crystallised in the wonderful con-

ceptions of the great men who directed their country's mind.

In looking, therefore, at nature in the earlier ages of scientific thought, we find

that the standpoint from which everything was viewed was narrowed down to a
universe constructed for man alone, the powers of which were governed by the

caprice and whim of the great gods of Olympus, and yet even in this period we

notice true opinions arising with regard to the structure of the universe. For

-- --instance, Pythagoras and Aristarchus conceived the idea that the sun was the

centre of the universe, and that the planets revolved around him.

     This correct deduction was to a large extent vitiated by bringing it into rela-
tion with another conception, that of harmonics.

    Hence we find the true ideas of Pythagoras mixed up, and in a sense confused,

by this theory of the harmony of the spheres.

    And even when at a later period, more accurate observation gave the ancient8
                    TRAIS'SACTIONS OF SECTION G.                      857

Still better data on whicli to reason, they yet continued to ascribe, as the very names
of the planets indicate, connections between them and the g-ods.

     The outcome, however, of the teaching of the Greek schools, culminating as it

did in the splendid worli of the Alexandrian philosophers, resulted in the mistaken
formula that the earth was the centre around which all the phenomena of nature

were carried on.
    It must not be imagined for one moment that Hipparchus and Ptolemy were

not acute and accurate observers. They at an early period detected some of those

inequalities in the moon's motion which require all the force of the gravitation

theory to explain.

They defined, by patient observation, the irregular motions of the planets,

sometimes progressing, sometimes retrograding, and with wonderful accuracy they

were able to measure the precession of the equinoxes which carries the equinoctial

points backwards along the line of the ecliptic.

    They had a very clear conception of the rotundity of the earth, as we know

from the fact that they made attempts to measure an arc of meridian.
    All this wonderful mass of observation and discovery, when taking into con-

sideration the imperfect means at their disposal, will ever remain throughout all

ages one of the greatest monuments to perpetuate the fame of the men who pro-

duced it.

HowThe question at once arises,      was it that with their wonderfully accurate

observations and their perfect knowledge of the movements of the heavenly bodies

they did not arrive at some of those revelations which later ages have brought to

light?

It is difficult to answer this question with any degree of precision, but one can

see clearly that their minds were governed, and the results of their inductions

vitiated, by conceptions such as those of which I have above spoken.

These conceptions were that, seeing that the sun, moon, and planets appeared

to revolve around the earth and return at dlfi'erent periods into closed orbits,
therefore, as a circle was the most perfect of all figures, they must necessarily

revolve in circular orbits, and that as celestial bodies this motion must be

uniform

Consequently, to unite together the accurate observations that they had made

of all the varying motions of the heavenly bodies, they had to invent circular

orbits and smaller orbits carried by these in which the sun and planets revolved,
and so gradually built up that wonderful and complex system, to which the name

of Ptolemy is always attached, of cycles, epicycles, and deferents, by which in a

most complicated manner they were able at length to reconcile their accurate
observations with their preconceived idea of circular motion. The Ptolemaic

system will always remain a wonderful monument to the skill of the observers and

the acuteness of the thinkers in the ancient world.

    Turning now to the domain of mechanics, with which were intimately bound up

their ideas of geometry, we find, as our old friend Euclid has long since taught us,

not only that they were among the most acute reasoners, but that they possessed
logic, which, when applied to such conceptions as these, has remained after 2,000

years the text-book in our schools.

But in their estimate of the uses of geometry and the functions of the conic

sections, the philosophers of old regarded them mainly as a species of intellectual

athletics by which the mind was trained and perfected, and they believed that it
was degradation to apply that knowledge to the affairs of mundane life.

    In the case of Archimedes we see the master-mind grappling for the first time

with some of the great problems of mass and of force, and solving to a large extent

some of the principal problems placed before him.

But here also Greek notions of mass and of force were mixed up with others,

which ascribe to them properties perfectly ideal, and it was considered, in the

words of our great poet, that the application of these wonderful discoveries to
the affairs of life was ' base mechanical.'

    No doubt much of this was due to the fact that the teachings of the old Greeks

were held to be exclusively the property of certain schools and academies, and that
                  ':

858 REPORT-- 1900.

the culture of the mind was the object in view. On the other hand, all the affairs

of life connected with the mechanical arts were confined for the most part to a

large section of the people who were held in slavery, and who, with but few

exceptions, never rose to intellectual pursuits.
      But, above all, as their ideas crystalli-ed into the form of concrete theories

nearly allied to many supernatural conceptions, these were gradually absorbed by

the priesthood and mingled with the national faith, to differ from which, as in the
case of Socrates, meant recantation or death.

     Reviewing, therefore, the above impressions of the ancient world, we find the

most accurate observations combined with the most fanciful theories, worked out
with a logical and a mathematical skill which all the world admires, yet vitiated
by conceptions or theories based on fanciful resemblances, and the whole gradually
consolidated by priestcraft into a mass of superstitious dogma, to differ from which

was to incur the odium of heresy.

    We shall see as we proceed that this palsy of the mind was again repeated

after a lapse of 1,500 years.

     But even in the century which immediately preceded our era, we have indica-

tions that there were clear theories which had they been followed out to the full

might have led to an earlier gathering in of the fruits of science.

     At this point I may perhaps be permitted to read a few passages from the
great Latin poet Lucretius, who in his sweet Pyrrhean verses attempts to lay
before his beloved Memmius, the Roman soldier, the learning of tl e Greeks.

      I shall use Munro's translation.
     The entire six books are taken up by an attempt on the part of Lucretius to

explain to Memmius the whole realm of nature, starting from the atomic stand-

point of Democritus and Epicurus.
      I should explain that in the following passages Lucretius calls the atoms the

first-beginnings of things.

     This poem was written in the first century before our era, and gives a good

idea of the attitude of the Roman mind in its admiration of Greek philosophy,

while at the same time attacking the gross superstition of the priests.

    ' When human life to view lay foully prostrate upon earth crushed down under
the weight of religion, who showed her head from the quarters of heaven with
hideous aspect lowering upon mortals, a man of Greece ventured first to lift up his
mortal eyes to her face and first to withstand her to her face. Him neither story

of gods nor thunderbolts nor heaven with threatening roar could quell : they only
chafed the more the eager courage of his soul, filling him with desire to be the

first to burst the fast bars of nature's portals. Therefore the living force of his

soul gained the day : on he passed far beyond the flaming walls of the world and
traversed throughout in mind and spirit the immeasurable universe ; whence he
returns a conqueror to tell us what can, what cannot come into being ; in short

on what principle each thing has its powers defined, its deep-set boundary mark.
Therefore religion is put under foot and trampled upon in turn ; us his victory

brings level with heaven.'
     ' This terror then and darkness of mind must be dispelled not by the rays of the

sun and glittering shafts of day, but by the aspect and the law of nature ; the warp
of whose design we shall begin with this first principle, nothing is ever gotten out
of nothing by divine power.' *

   We* must admit therefore that nothing can come from nothing, since things

require seed before they can severally be born and be brought out into the buxom

fields of air.' ^

     ' Moreover nature dissolves everything back into its first bodies and does not

annihilate things.' *

    ' And yet all things are not on all sides jammed together and kept in by body

there is also void in things.*

     ' Time also exists not by itself, but simply from the things which happen the

·what is to follow after. And we must admit that no one feels time by itself

abstracted from the motion and calm rest of things.'

Lucretius, speaking as in the following lines of atoms as the first-beginnings,

appears to have the conception, not only of atoms, but also of molecules ; for
instance :

     'Bodies again are partly first-beginnings of things, partly those which are
formed of a union of first-beginnings.' -

     ' But since I have proved above that nothing can be produced from nothing,
and that what is begotten cannot be recalled to nothing, first-beginnings must be

of an imperishable body, into which all things can be dissolved at their last hour,

that there may be a supply of matter for the reproduction of things.' ^
    From the following quotations it will be seen that Lucretius had a very good

idea of the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest.

     ' That also which before was from the earth passes back into the earth, and
that which was sent from the borders of ether is carried back and taken in again
by the quarters of heaven.' *

' Thus one thing will never cease to rise out of another, and life is granted to

none in fee-simple, to all in usufruct.' ^

' And many races of living things must then have died out and been unable to

beget and continue their breed. For in the case of all things which you see

breathing the breath of life, either craft or courage or else speed has from the

beginning of its existence protected and preserved each particular race. And there

are many things which, recommended to us by their useful services, continue to

exist consigned to our protection. In the first place the fierce breed of lions and

the savage races their courage has protected, foxes their craft, and stags their

proneness to flight. But light-sleeping dogs with faithful heart in breast and

every kind which is born of the seed of beasts of burden, and at the same time the

·woolly flocks and the horned herds, are all consigned, Memmius, to the protection

of man. For they have ever fled with eagerness from wild beasts, and have

ensued peace and plenty of food obtained without their own labour, as we give it

in requital of their useful services. But those to whom Nature has granted none

of these qualities, so that they could neither live by their own means nor perform

for us any useful service in return for which we should suB'er their kind to feed

and be safe under our protection, those, you are to know, would lie exposed as a

prey and booty of others, hampered all in their own death-bringing shackles, until

Nature brought that kind to utter destruction.'

    I must conclude my quotations from Lucretius with his splendid exordium to

Memmius in the second book.

' Apply now, we entreat, your mind to true reason. For a new question

struggles earnestly to gain your ears, a new aspect of things to display itself.
But there is nothing so easy as not to be at first more difficult to believe than

afterwards; and nothing too so great, so marvellous, that all do not gradually

abate their admiration of it. Look up at the bright and unsullied hue of heaven and

the stars which it holds within it, wandering all about, and the moou and the

sun's light of dazzling brilliancy : if all these things were now for the first time,
if I say they were now suddenly presented to mortals beyond all expectation,
what could have been named that would be more marvellous than these things,

or that nations beforehand would less venture to believe could be ? nothing,

methinks                                       so wondrous  strange  had    been tnis  sight.  Yet how little, you know,
                                            :

wearied as all are to satiety with seeing, any one now cares to look up into heaven's

glittering quarters ! Cease therefore to be dismayed by the mere novelty and so

to reject reason from your mind with loathing : weigh the questions rather with

keen judgment, and if they seem to you to be true, surrender, or if they are a

falsehood, gird yourself to the encounter. For since the sum of space is unlimited

outside beyond these walls of the world, the mind seeks to apprehend what there

is yonder there, to which the spirit ever yearns to Inok forward, and to which the

mind's immission reaches in free and unembarrassed flight.'

In the early centuries of our era, however, a great change was coming over

Wethe human mind.  have seen from the ahove quotations that, even before the

advent of Christianity, thinking men were beginning to revolt against the super-

stition of the old mythology.
     Soon after there arose the Neoplatonic school at Alexandria, which mixed up,

in a way diificult to describe, beautiful conceptions of moral and religious

training through astronomy and the sciences in an iusxplicable tangle of pseudo-

Greek philosophy.

    At the same time there was gradually stealing over the minds of men an
entirely new feeling, born of a new faith, which taught that things earthly and

appertaining to the earth were of slight importance, and that all the splendid

learning of the Greeks was but vain philosophy, and that the thoughts of man

must be directed, not to the present, but to the future.

    Among these conflicting ideas, there was intruded the outer barbaric power
which knew nothing of science or of philosophy, but which, by its virile force and
austere tenacity of moral worth, overran and conquered the Roman Empire.

     These untutored peoples were soon attracted by the beautiful simplicity of the

new religion, and were gradually absorbed into the Christian Church.

     In the year a.d. 640 a serious blow was struck to advancing science, and for a
thousand years we are parted from all the learning of the ancient world by the

destruction of the Alexandrian Library by the Saracens.
     Then followed for nearly a thousand years that period of intellectual torpor

which we generally denominate ' the dark ages.' To a large extent natural

science became unknown, the astronomy of the Greeks degenerated into astrology,
and when occasional thiokers did inquire into nature's secrets, it took the form of

alchemy, and a desire to discover the philosopher's stone, and the transmutation of

metals. Mixed up with these were also a school of magicians, individuals who

--revelled in mysteries always an indication of ignorant superstition.

During this period the ideas of the universe were taught from the books of

Moses; even the learned lost all conception of the rotundity of the earth, and

indeed we have treatises written to prove that we live on a flat world.
    Of course, during the period I am speaking of there were some minds, in

isolated cases, which still believed in the teaching of the Ptolemaic system. But

the overruling authority of the Church crushed out all inquiry into the nature of

things, deeming it sufficient that men should either remain ignorant, or devote their

attention to a future existence.

    At length, however, after the conquest of Constantinople, in 1453, there came
a period when the literature of the ancient world again claimed attention, and the

logic of Aristotle became the dominant factor in the teaching of the Church.

    Another element was also contributing to the revival of the human in-

tellect.

    The Saracens, after their conquest of Alexandria, had preserved in the univer-
sities of Bagdad and Damascus much of the learning of the philosophers of the

ancient world. This in the course of time followed their conquests along the

northern coast of Africa, and was gradually grafted into the European mind by

the teaching of the doctrines of the school at Salamanca ; and it is to this channel,

strange to say, that we are indebted for what we know of the tenets of Hippar-
chus and Ptolemy, as well as to many of the alchemistic sciences which they them-

selves assiduously cultivated.

    Thus gradually we see dawning upon the benighted minds of the middle ages

a revival of the learning of the ancient world.

    The invention of printing and the lessons of the Reformation at once threw
open the whole question to independent thought, and at the same time afforded a
means of free interchange of opinions throughout the whole world.

     About this same time the vexed question of the earth's rotundity was for ever
set at rest by the discoveries of Columbus in 1492, and the circumnavigation of the

globe in 1522.

    I now approach a period when it becomes necessary to show, with somewhat
more exactitude than that with which I have hitherto treated the subject, how
                                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  861

gradually there grew up in the minds of men those modern truths to which I have

alluded in the opening passages of my remarks.

To attempt to do justice to this theme in the few minutes at my disposal would

be indeed a vain endeavour ; but for the purpose of showing the lines along which

they ran, and to enable you to carry away with you the sequence of events to

which I am about to allude, I liave prepared a chronological chart.

     This chart extends from the time of Edward VI., in 1550, to the present year.
Horizontally it is divided, as you will notice, into years, and to the same scale

vertically into years also.

Immediately below are marked off the reigns of the various English sovereigns,

under which are recorded, against their proper dates, some of the principal
political events of the period. At the top of the chart will also be found, against

their appropriate dates, a record of some of the principal social events, voyages, dis-

coveries, inventions, and other data which indicate the progress of science and the

arts, as well as of those social events which mark the increase of civilisation and

Athe growth of kindlier feelings in the human race.    few statistics are also given

of population, the output of coal and iron, and the progress of railway develop-

ment, to show how rapid has been the advance during the present century.

In the body of the chart are marked off by diagonal lines, commencing at their

births and terminating at their deaths, the names of the great thinkers and workers,

scientific and otherwise, who have done so much for the advancement of the human

mind                         and  coming  later in the field, and marked in red, are noted those engineers
                          ;

whose work alone became possible as the study of nature broadened out and bore

fruit. Consequently, by running the eye vertically upwards at any particular

period, it will at once be seen who were the great contemporaries of that period,

to what predecessors they were indebted, and what was the state of science during
their lifetime, and among what political events they carried on their work.

   A very brief inspection of this chart will show that to no one man or country

can be ascribed the sole merit of advancement.

Advancement depends on the knowledge we have inherited from our ancestors,

and the opinions of our contemporaries acting on and reacting upon each other, and

together forming what we may call the drift of opinion of any age or period which
we may examine.

At the stage at which we have now arrived it is as well to conceive what must

have been the feelings of men, especially of Englishmen, in the middle part of the

sixteenth century. By the Reformation their minds had been opened to the

exercise of private judgment, and there was presented before them a circumstance

never before experienced, nor which can ever again appeal to the human mind.
    By the discovery of the new world the earth space had been practically

doubled. These two great factors, freedom of thought and the enlargement of the

world, aided by printed books, produced fresh fruit in literature and science, and

an enthusiasm, almost amounting to the romantic, which carried men on to enter-

prises of the most daring kind, and filled them with the confidence that a great

and brilliant future was in store for the human race.

The poetry and literature of the Elizabethan period teem with these senti-

ments, and these feelings sank deep into the minds of thinking men when they

contemplated more serious subjects.

Peter Ramus (1515-1572) attacked the Aristotelian philosophy.

Copernicus (1473-1543) revived the idea of Pythagoras and Aristarchus, that

Ihe sun, and not the earth, was the centre around which it revolved in company

with the other planets. He, however, still retained the notion that they revolved

in circles, and had, of course, to resort to epicycles, deferents, and the like, to

account for their apparent irregular motions.

At a little later period, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) was carrying on a series of

astronomical observations of an accuracy never before attempted; and although he

did not accept the Copernican theory, yet he so far began to lose faith in that of

Ptolemy as to propound a theory of his own to reconcile his more accurate

observations.

About the same time, William Gilbert (1540-1603) published his work on the
862 REPORT-- 1900.

magnet, and Sir i?rancis Drake, led away by that entbusiasol of Whlcli t haVe
already spoken, in his great voyage round the world added new glories to English

navigation.

     As conceptions more exact and observations more accurate were made, it
became necessary in some way to shorten the laborious calculations previously
carried on. Hence we get about this time the invention of logarithms by Napier

of Merchiston.

     But this evident advancement of the mind was opposed fiercely by the powers
of the Church, resulting in the burning of Giordano Bruno at Venice, in the

year 1600, for upholding the Copernican theory.

    There now came upon the scene one of the greatest thinkers of our country, to
whom all Englishmen, if not all Europeans, should feel the deepest gratitude, the

great thinker, Francis Bacon, who, in his various works which he has left behind
him, bequeathed to future ages that system of inductire philosophy which has
done so much for the advancement of learning.

     As you will remember, his first doctrine is that we must avoid the errors which
are inherent in the human race, and which he classes under the four heads of

' Idols of the tribe/ ' Idols of the den,' ' Idols of the forum or market,' and ' Idols

of the theatre.'

     Having got rid of erroneous and preconceived opinions, he lays down rules of
right thinking, afforded by scientific facts which have been invaluable in the

investigation of science.

     ?Ie does not touch upon religious and controversial subjects which engaged

the attention of so large a proportion of his contemporaries, but directs the whole
force of his philosophy to the acquisition of what he calls ' fruits,' that is to say,

the pursuit of truth for its own sake.
    And as Macaulay says of him, although he is best known by his essays, yet of

his more philosophical works he remarks that * they have moved the intellects
which have moved the world.'

   We now have to consider for a moment a name which should be highly

honoured among all men of science, but especially among engineers, for to Galileo
we are indebted for the first principles of mechanics. He invented the thermo-
meter about 1602, and the telescope which bears his name in 1609.

      In 1586 he composed his first essay on the hydrostatic balance, and his observa-
tions on the swinging of the great bronze lamp in the Cathedral of Pisa, as well
as his experiments on the centre of gravity, and on falling bodies from the leaning
tower, laid the foundation of the exact determination of some of our simplest

mechanical conceptions.

      His astronomical observations of the moon, his discovery of Jupiter's satellites
 in 1610, as well as the rings of Saturn and the phases of Venus, gave to the
 Copernican theory the basis of fact which was before wanting.

      It is needless to say that Galileo advocated most strongly the theory of his
 predecessor Copernicus, and for the doctrines which he so taught he was brought
 before the Inquisition, imprisoned, and his latter days rendered miserable by the
 persecution of the Church.

     Contemporary with Galileo was his illustrious correspondent Kepler, who in
 the most laborious manner, from the observations of Tycho Brahe and other

 accurate astronomers, gradually gave to the world tho?6 laws which bear his name,
 and fixed for all time the fact that the planets revolved around the sun, not in
 circular, but in elliptical orbits.

      These teachings, assisted by the illustrious Gassendi, were gradually forming

 in the minds of men a somewhat more accurate idea of the universe in which we

 live.

    We now come to one of those great minds, who, in the realm of philosophy, had

 a vast influence in turning the thoughts of men into direct channels. I allude to
 that distinguished Frenchman, Ren4 Descartes.

     I do not propose to inquire into his axiom, ' I think, therefore I am ; ' into his

 conception of innate ideas, nor into his theory of vortices, but would merely point

 out what may be almost called his great discovery, namely, the application of
Transactions of section (J.  863

feigebtaical I'easoning to geometrical conceptions and astronomical observa-

 tions.

      Of course his freedom of thought offended many, both the Jesuits, in whose
school he had been educated, and the pastors of the Reformed Church, among

whom he lived in Holland. And it is well known that he delayed to give to the

world some of his best ideas owing to the way in which Galileo had been treated

by the Church.

     The English philosophical writer, Thomas Hobbes, by the publication of his
work called ' The Leviathan,' was also educating the minds of Englishmen in the

direction of sound knowledge.

     It is interesting, however, to note that the new ideas had not as yet sunk deeply

into the minds of the English people.

    Shakespeare remarks : ' He that is giddy thinks the world turns round

('Taming of the Shrew'). Bacon also nsver accepted the Copernican theory, and if

we turn to the eighth book of ' Paradise Lost ' we find that although Milton, who
had visited Galileo in Italy, and who was well acquainted with the theory of
Copernicus, founds his whole poem on a Ptolemaic basis, yet he was, apparently
from the words which he puts into the mouth of the archangel Raphael, halting

between two opinions.

    We now have to note another of the experimental philosophers in Christian

Huygens.

    Up to his time, the means of making accurate observations in which time was
concerned was a most difficult, nay almost an impossible, matter. By his introduction
of the pendulum, as a regulator of clocks, he at once placed in the hands of men

of science one of its most valuable instruments.

     His work on the centre of oscillation and the cycloidal curve shows how deeply

he worked out the theory.

      His observations on double I'efraction, and his promulgation of the theory of

an elastic ethereal medium in which the vibrations of light are carried on, place
him in the forefront of the observers of his time.

     The sagacious Hooke, Wren, Wallis, and Newton's great master Barrow, as
well as the distinguished Boyle and the indefatigable Oldenburgh, were all carrying
forward the work which distinguishes this period ; and when we look back to

those pleasant meetings at Wadham College, Oxford, during the Commonwealth
we contemplate a body of men working for true science who were to be the founders

of that Royal Society which has done so much for the advancement of science

throughout the world.

    The labours of all the great men of whom I have yet spoken were at this

period gradually drawing together a vast mass of facts which required some com-

mon explanation. The rudiments of mechanical science were beginning to teach

the truth as to the laws of falling and oscillating bodies.
     The Ptolemaic system, with its complex theories, was gradually yielding to the

accumulated evidence in favour of the Copernican system.
     The erroneous idea of circular motion had yielded, as the fruit of Kepler's per-

severing work, to the law of elliptical orbits.

    But yet the minds of many men were still directed by the idea that the

planets were carried round the sun by some inherent force in themselves, and in

the same very imperfect way they were beginning gradually to think that this

force, be it what it might, acted in inverse ratio to the square of the distance.
     Matters were in this state when there arose the greatest genius that the English

race has yet produced, the retiring, the sensitive, and the devout Isaac Newton,
who, acting like an electric spark in a mixed and chaotic mass of vapour, at once
precipitated, as it were, the confusion, and brought to light, with a dazzling bril-
liancy, the gravitation theory, which not only accounted for all the difficulties which

his contemporaries were struggling with, but at one bound elucidated those many

and confusing motions of the heavenly bodies which had hitherto been the stum-

bling block of observers.

    By his discoveries, for the first time an accurate scale was given to the universe,

and in his statement that every particle of matter in the universe is attracted
8C4 REPORT-- 1900.

directly as the mass, and Inversely as tbe square of the distance, vre have laid
before the world once and for all time a sure and certain guide to all the
phenomena of nature.

    He reveals to us distances incomprehensible, and magnitudes which transcend
the most fanciful ideas of his predecessors, and flowing from this we have esta-

blished the important conclusion that as far as matter is concerned, whether in the

case of our own planet, in the sun, in the mighty orbs of Jupiter and Saturn, or in

the distant nebulae and stellar masses, the whole is governed by exact law, and is
not a fortuitous concourse of atoms, or the result of some unexplained and inex-

plicable vortex motion.

    "We may say of him in the words which I have above quoted from Lucretius,

' the living force of his soul gained the day : on he passed far beyond the flaming
walls of the world and traversed throughout in mind and spirit the immeasurable
universe ; whence he returns a conqueror to tell us what can, what cannot come
into being ; in short on what principle each thing has its powers defined, its deep-

set boundary mark.'

    "We must now turn to the contemplation of a great thinker who, although not

a scientific man, has yet had the most profound influence in the direction of clear

reasoning of perhaps any man in England since the time of Bacon. I allude to the
illustrious John Locke, the friend of Newton, of Boyle, of Monmouth, of Somers,

of Clarke, of Montagu, of Pembroke, and of Shaftesbury, admired ahke by Horace
"Walpole and by Voltaire, and the trusted friend and councillorof William of Orange,

     Intimately connected with the freedom of the press and the currency of this
country, one of the first commissioners for trade and the colonies, he is princi-

pally distinguished by his charming essay on 'The Human Understanding.'

     Putting aside the metaphysical conception of Descartes, he lays down the law
that all our knowledge must be founded on two principles, experience of the outer
world through our senses, which he calls ' sensation,' and the inner working of the
mind on the experience so gained, which he calls * reflection.'

     To his clear and lucid English which appeals to every reader, taken in conjunc-
tion with the simple facts which he enunciates, the English nation is indebted for
much of that common sense and freedom from fanciful speculation for which we
are distinguished among the nations of the world.

     At the end of the seventeenth century Boyle, Hooke, and many others of their

illustrious contemporaries were, in the early days of the Royal Society, founding
that school of physics and chemistry which, taking the place of the alchemy and
the magic of the middle ages, was being gradually moulded into shape in accord-
ance with true induction and in a scientific spirit. But little had yet been done in

the study of the earth itself.
      Pliny mentions the fact that fossil shells had been found ; and Leonardo da

Vinci, about the beginning of the sixteenth century, had argued that these fossils
were the remains of extinct beings, and not lusits naturce formed by the action of
the stars on the plastic substance of the earth ; nor, as taught by the Church,

shells dropped from the hats of pilgrims on their way I'rom the Holy Land.
     And even at the end of the eighteenth century Johnson spoke, as it will be

remembered, of people engaged in such a study as ' fossilists.'
      "\i\''e are indebted, however, for right thinking on truly scientific lines to

Hutton, to Playfair, to "Werner, and to Cuvier, who about the end of the

 eighteenth century began to formulate distinct and clear conceptions on the

 subject.

      The rocks of which the earth's crust was composed were gradually being

 divided into aqueous, pliitonic, and metamorphic.

     It was clearly established that among the aqueous deposits the various strata
 contained fossils different both in kind and in species from those of living beings.

     To our illustrious countryman "William Smith we are indebted for the first
geological map of Central and Northern England.

     Controversies arose as to how the great succession of events which accurate
inquiry was unfolding to our knowledge was produced : whether upheavals and

 depressions in the earth's crust were due to sudden cataclysms, dividing and
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.      865

  shutting off, as it were, each successive period from those which preceded or

  succeeded it ; or whether, as some imagined, they were the result of the Noachian

  deluge.

      And in the beginning of this century fierce discussions arose as to whether or

  not the whole tendency of these investigations was not intensely irreligious, as it

 appeared to be at variance with the account of the creation as given by Moses.

       In 1830 to 1833, however, by the publication of his * Principles of Geology, or
 the Modern Changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants,' Sir Charles Lyell, following
 on the lines laid down by Hutton and Playfair, in the most philosophic spirit

 proved beyond a doubt that all the great changes which geology disclosed were

 the outcome of the action of those forces of nature which we see around us,

 0]ierating with greater or less energy throughout long ages.

     Lyell did not attempt to theorise on how or why the remains of extinct

                  _

 animals and plants succeeded each other in the rocks, but he pointed out in the

 most precise manner that, whether we take the primary, the secondary, or the
 tertiary periods, the different series of organisms, of which we find the remains,
 were each distinctive of its particular zone; and that as we examine the tertiary

 strata their characteristics become more and more similar to the animals and

 plants which we see around us at the present day.
      Newton had taught us that the sum of space throughout the universe is prac-

 tically unlimited, and that the whole is governed by law and not caprice.

     The teaching of geology has instructed us in a somewhat similar way that the

 time over which the present forces of nature that have tended to form' the earth,

 as we now see it, have operated, is to be measured, not by 6,000 years, but by
many millions of years.

     I do not pretend to enter upon the vexed question of how many millions of

years, but what I wish to direct your attention to is that, as astronomy teaches an
 almost infinite space, geology teaches not perhaps an infinite but a vastly extended
period of operation almost beyond the grasp of the human mind.

      I have spoken above of the action and interaction of the thoughts of our pre-

decessors and our contemporaries in forming and originating new scientific

conceptions in different periods.

   A curious example of this is to be found in modern science.

      Malthus published his essay on population in 1798, Sir Charles Lvell his
' Principles of Geology ' in 1830 to 1833.

     The great Charles Darwin has told us that it v.'as by the study of these two
 nooks that he was first led to contemplate those changes in nature, and to amass
that vast collection of scientific thought, which resulted in ' The Origin of Species,'
published in 1859, coincidently corroborated by the illustrious Wallace.

     The co-operation of these two great thinkers, the graceful way in which the

younger gave place to the older observer, marks an advance in the kindlier feelings
of contemporaneous scientific workers, in marked contrast to the virulent and often
acrimonious controversies which characterised the period ofDescartes and Newton.

    I am not going to enter into a description of the Darwinian hypothesis, but it

is sufficient to say that putting on one side for a moment the details with which it
deals, the teaching of Darwin has produced during the last thirty years an entire
revolution in our ideas, whether we look at them in literature or in science, bv
which we begin to understand how, in the long series of past ages, the various
organisms which we find in the fossil state have passed gradually and almost
imperceptibly from a lower to a higher state of organisation. And possibly in the
teachings .if our great countryman we see, for the first time, perhaps, in a some-
what dim and distant way, a scientific reason for the origin of thoc^e innate ideas
which formed so large a portion of the teaching of that great Frenchman Ren6

Descartes.

    And, again, we s^e in the teachings of science the reiterated lesson that nature

works by slow degrees in an orderly and regular succession, ever advancing, ever
improving:, and not by spasmodic jerks ; and the train of such ideas naturally leads
the mind to the contemplation of a future more perfect and more beautiful in all
that is good and true.

    And ia tho words of Tennyson we may say

             Yet I doubt not, through the ages one increasing purpose runs,

            And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.

    It is not my object to trace the advance of science in all its branches down to

the present time.

     I have above indicated the general lines along which the human mind has
advanced in laying the fouudations of our modern views ; but so intimately are we,

as engineers, connected with all the sciences that I must just refer in the briefest
manner to the development of chemical science as it grew out of tlie teaching of
Aristotle and Galen, that there were four elements, to the acid and alkaline dis-
coveries of Sylvius, through the teaching of Geoffrey and Stahl of the phlogistic

theory.

    We then have the discovery of oxygen by Priestley, and fixed air by Black and

Cavendish, composition of water by Cavendish, Watt, and Lavoisier, followed by

Davy and Dalton, the latter of whom formed our present conception of the atomic

theory and the combination of the elements in their true proportions.

     Through Davy, Faraday, and Tyndall we gradually arrive at our electro-

chemical ideas of the present day.

    We last year had so lucid an exposition from Professor Fleming, at Dover, of

the march of progress in electrical science during the past century that it would

be presumption on my part to attempt to recapitulate even the names which

extend from William Gilbert, in the sixteenth century, down to the discoveries of
Hertz of the present day. But I may be permitted to point out that from the time
of Volta, Ampere, and Oersted the rapid progress which electrical science has made
has been due in no small measure to the manner in which its experiments have
been treated, on strictly mathematical lines, by the master minds of such men as
Maxwell and Kelvin, until at last we arrive at the demonstration, long foretold,
of the wave theory, which renders wireless telegraphy an accomplished fact.

      Light to the engineer has at all times been of supreme importance, and on the

chart we mav scan the names of those who have advanced our scientific knowledge
of it from Galileo, Descartes, Huygens, Gregory, Newton, up to Roemer who dis-
covered its velocity, then Halley, Herschel, and the illustrious Thomas Young who
revived and Fresnel who perfected the undulatory theory, until at last we come

to those mysterious Fraunhofer lines, previously noticed by Wollaston, interpreted
byBunsen and Kirchhoff in 1860, and applied as an aid to chemistry in the analyses
of terrestrial and celestial bodies.

     In the theory of heat we have the experiments of Cavendish and Priestley

investigated by Count Rumford, illustrated by Tyndall, and bearing fruit in
 Joule's mechanical equivalent.

     Perhaps none of the allied sciences appears so distant from our own profession as

 that of physiology.

      The discovery of Harvey gives us, however, a beautiful insight into animal
 mechanics ; and the observations of Leeuwenhoek about the year 1700 first bring
 us into contact with those minute organisms which he discovered by means of the

 microscope, and which are now found to play so large a part in tlie economy of

 nature.

     Up to within the last twenty years it was generally held that dead organic

 matter, anima! and vegetable, could but, in the words of Shakespeare, 'lie in cold
 obstruction and rot,' this process being assisted, it was assumed, by chemical

 oxidation; and, until the researches of Pasteur and Koch, we were entirely ignorant
 of the fact that nature had at her command countless millinns of organisms,

 always reducing the effete products of animal and vegetable life back into simpler

 elements.

     The tendency of later years has clearly been, whether we look at the links

 which unite heat and work, chemistry with electricity and magnetisnj, and light
 with boih, or physiology with chemistry, to obliterate those boundary lines which

we have been accustomed to regard as fixed, and from the time of the publication
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                          867

of Sir W. Grove's correlation of the physical forces in 1846 we have made con-

tinued advances in the same direction.

    What the future may have in store for us we cannot imatfine, but clearly if we
compare the facts known at the commencement of the nineteenth century with
those in our possession at the beginning of the twentieth century, we may look

forward to a still richer harvest of what Bacon calls ' fruits.'

     Lookinof hack upon the facts that I have been enabled, and I feel so imperfectly,

to brinfj before you, I have ' to answer ' the question with which we set out.
     Modern scieutific thought is due to an inquiry into Nature and her works,

irrespective of all preconceived theories, and the breaking away from the authority
which other departments of human thought and faith have in former ages imposed
upon some of the earlier inquirers into science.

     Faith in religion has been defined as ' the substance of things hoped for, the
evidence of thinf;;s not seen,' which is altogether apart from the other and wider
faith with which the scientific inquirer contemplates that vast, that stupendous,
that beautiful universe which has been revealed to him by the teaching of his pre-
decessors, and which inspires him with those hopes to which I have just alluded.

    On the teaching of the ancients Bacon remarks : ' The opinion which men

entertain of antiquity is a very idle thing, and almost incongruous to the world
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

for the old age and length of days of the world should in reality be accounted anti-

quity, and ought to be attributed to onr own times, not to the youth of the world
which is enjoyed among the ancients, for that age, though with respect to us it be
ancient and greater, yet with regard to the world it was new and less.'

     This idea is perhaps more and more beautifully expressed by Tennyson in the

words ' I, the heir of all the ages in the foremost files of time.'

    And in another respect, taking Bacon's teaching which he so often reiterates, as
being a search after fruits, we must not imagine that the fruits of which he speaks

are necessarily to be gathered in by the worker himself. For the pursuit of true

science is often hindered by the too greedy effort to grasp the sordid rewards of
the present, and, alas ! Bacon himself will ever stand as a most painful example

of the depth of degradation to which even the highest minds may fall.

   We must learn from Nature what she is connnually teaching, that her efforts

are directed, not solely for the benefit of the individual, but for the welfare and
the advancement of the race.

     The fruits and the rewards which grow from a study of Nature, and a truly
scientific effort to expound her laws, are of a higher and a wider scope.

    And in contemplating the work of the great men of the past with whose names
we have been so freely dealing, looking at the present attitude of the scientific

mind, and our share in the application and directing of those great sources of

power in Nature, we may say :

                  ' No more a wind-borne leaf upon the waves
                  Of time and chance, but one to whom is given,
                     To help the mighty purpose of the world,
                     To straighten crooked paths, to smooth the bills

                      Of sin and sorrow, that on some bright day

                   The great wheels of the world may run their course

                      Without one jar or check.'

     The following Papers were read :

                      1 . Resistance of Road Vehicles to Traction.

                    Bn Professor Hele Shaw, LL.D., F.R.S.

     About the time of the general introduction of railways considerable attention
was directed to the nature of the resistances encountered by vehicles upon the
common road, and the researches of Correze, Edgeworth, Coriolis, Morin, Tredgold,
Dupuit, and others must be regarded as having thrown considerable light upon the
subject. From time to time recently others have done work in this direction, but
there is no doubt that the attention directed to traction on railways has thrown
the scientific investigation of the subject of common roads almost entirely into the
background. During the last few years, however, it has been realised that there
was a great field for the development of traction, and particularly by mechanical
means upcm the common roads, and the improvement which has been quietly
taking place in the construction and maintenance of roads is a feature of national
importance. Not only is the condition of the pavements in the cities and towns
much improved, but in out-of-the-way districts, such as in the hilly parts of
Cumberland and Westmorland, the use of steam rollers by the County Councils
has etfected vast improvement in the state of the roads. Various causes have
contributed to this result, but it is worthy of notice that whereas when the
coaching days became comparatively a thing of the past the roads fell into neglect,

so now the increasing number of cyclists and tourists who visit country places
are an appreciable factor worthy of consideration and encouragement by the

local authorities. The recent remarkable and growing development of motor
vehicles with a legal limit of speed as hiofh as twelve miles an hour, and the
generally increased speeds of tram-cars in cities owing to the introduction of
electricity and steam, give some reason for thinking the general rate of speed on
common "roads may reach, or even exceed, the present legal limit applying to motor
vehicles. As showing the mechanical possibilities in this direction, it may be
pointed out that quite recently in France between forty and fifty miles an hour

-- --has been salely maintained for more than 300 miles upon the common road.

Such a speed or anything approaching to it would not be allowed in this
country, but the fact remains that it is possible with safety. With heavy traffic
the legal limit for a self-propelled waggon of about two tons tare, capable of carrj^-
ing several tons, is no less than eight miles an hour, and the heaviest traffic with
a tare limit of vehicle of three tons, probably carrying a load of eight or ten more,
is as high .as live milfs an hour.

     These facts, and the introduction generally of mechanical propulsion, point to

th« necessity of having a fairl^' complete knowledge' of the resistance of common
roads of various kinds upon diiferent classes of vehiclea moving at dillerent speeds.

In the brief historii-al account ^iven by the author of what has hitherto been
dune in this direction it will be seen that the experimental means of traction has

-- --without exception as iar as the author is aware been limited to traction by

horses ; and as at any rate the earlier experiments were made with the view of
horse traction, only two speeds were taken into account, viz., walking and trotting.
Considering the variation in speed of horses under these two conditions, these terms
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                  869

cannot be said to express anything very definite, and certainly aiford no guidance
whatever as to the resistance of self-propelled vehicles at various speeds. Again
in recent years large sections of cities have been paved with asphalte and wood,
while the laying of setts or stone pavements has undergone considerable modi-

fication, which is readily seen by an examination of a modern street and one of ten

or fifteen years ago. Another modern development is the introduction of solid
indiarubber and pneumatic tyres, which were at first regarded merely as a luxurv,

but have now proved to be an important factor in the life of the vehicle, as well
as of its resistance, this being so much the case that eftbrts have from time to time

been made to introduce the use of indiarubber tyres upon traction engines.

Beyond the foregoing points, which have not been brought under investigation

in connection with the resistance of vehicles, no attempt appears to have been

made to ascertain the extent to which the various factors of resistance relatively
                                it is evident that as the higher speeds are used, and
Nowaffect the whole result.

the weights are increased, vibration and shock become more and more important

thus the resistance due to the rim of the wheel, and the ways in which it can be
met by mechanical contrivances, must be regarded as quite a different problem from
that of the springs attached to the body of vehicles, and some distinction must be

made between the resistances as aflfected by each of the foregoing.

Enough has been said to show that there is not only matter for an inquiry

which would be welcomed by makers of road vehicles, especially of self-propelled
road vehicles, but that such an investigation, if it is to be of any real vakie, must

be thorough, and requires not only some expenditure of money, but cannot well be
undertaken by any single individual. The great interest which was excited by

the paper read by Mr. Thorneycroft at the last meeting at Dover of the Briti.sh

Association, and" the previous communications which have passed between the

author and the Tresident of this Section, who is himself a higli authority upon

the question of roads, have led to this matter being brought forward with the

idea of forming a committee of the British Association for the investigation of

road resistance.

     In order to facilitate the work of the Committee, a summary of previous investi-
gations in this subject has been prepared, which can be laid before the members, if

it is formed. Some preliminary experiments have also been made with a view to
obtaining some idea of the nature of the apparatus required, and the amount of

expense likely to be entailed.

                                               Preliminary Experiments,

     Allusion has been made to the fact that all the previous experiments have been
performed by means of the traction of horses : it seemed with the introduction of
powerful motor cars it might be able to pull steadily any vehicle at any required

speed. Thii idea really forms the chief feature of the proposed experiments, as it
is evident that if one motor car is not sutticient two or more could be harnessed

to the vehicle which is to be drawn. In order to ascertain how far this idea was
practicable, Mr. J. A. Holder, of Birmingham, who owns a 12 h.p. Daimler car,
was kind enough to visit Liverpool, and on Tuesday, AVednesday, and Tliursday,

July 17, 18, and 19, a series of experiments, in which the author was assisted by
two former students, Mr. Humfrey, B.Sc, and Mr. Cormack, B.Sc, were made,

Mr. Holder's autocar towing the author's New Orleans Voiturette. These

experiments took place over roads of asphalte, wood, setts, and macadam in the

neighbourhood of Liverpool, both level and up the steepest gradients which could
be found, viz., Everton Brow, the details of which were given in a wall diagram.
It will not serve any useful purpose at present to give the detailed results of these
experiments, as they were obviously iucomplete, and pointed to the absolute

necessity of more elaborate apparatus of a self-recording nature ; but it may be of
interest to explain the apparatus actually employed, so as to indicate what will be

required to insure satisfactory results.

     The apparatus consists of two parts, which were illustrated by wall diagrams

(1) a dynamometer, and (2) a speed indicator :

   --Dynamometer. This consisted of an ordinary spring balance, the back of
--

Vhich was riveted to a cylinder of a small steam engine ·which acted as A dash*

pot. The ports of the steam cylinder were closed up, and a small hole drilled

into the piston was found quite sufficient when the cylinder was filled with oil to

--check the free oscillations of the spring.
     Speed Indicator. The speed indicator was a Schaffer and Budenburg tacho-

meter to which a temporary wooden wheel was attached, and a special dial was

made, so that instead of indicating revolutions per minute the miles per hour at

which the vehicle was travelling were at once made visible. The mode of con-

Aducting the experiments is shown by a photograph.    rope about 20 feet long

was attached to the Voiturette and connected with the dynamometer, the dial of

which an observer was able to read. At the same time a second observer called

out the actual speed of the vehicle at that instant and the nature of the road

which was being passed over, which were recorded by the first observer in his

notebook, together with the pull on the dynamometer.

     The net result of the experiments showed that, even on apparently the
smoothest road, the variation in the pull was so considerable that nothing but
appliances which would record autographically both the pull and velocity at the
same instant and indicate also the distance travelled, so as to identify the exact
piece of road corresponding to the record, would be of any value. Moreover, it was
evident that some autographic record of the nature of the road, as well as some
instrument for recording the vibration of the vehicle which was being towed, was
necessary in order to form some estimate of the effect of vibration upon the resist-
ance. With such appliances the pull on waggons, lorries, ordinary vehicles with
iron rims, pneumatic and indiarubber tyres, could be investigated for any speed,
and it is not too much to hope that some definite idea of the laws concerning
traction might be found, with the eflect of springs, tyres, and the surface of the

road taken into account.

                         2. The Viagraph. By J. Brown.

     The viagraph is an instrument for indicating the degree of unevenness of road
surfaces, and consists in principle of a straight edge to be drawn along the road
surface and provided with a profiling wheel running on the surface, the vertical
motions of which are transmitted to a pencil marking on a paper band, drawn
under its point by a drum revolved by gear connected to the profiling wheel. The
result is a profile of the road surface full size vertically, and \ inch to 1 foot
horizontally. Means are provided for indicating the sum of the vertical motions
of the profiling wheel, which sum represents numerically the relative unevenness
of the road, and is called the index of unevenness when taken for a unit length of
88 yards of road. This length is automatically measured by the instrument, and
an alarm bell rung when it has been traversed. Speculations as to the causes of
unevenness, the proper make of wheels and springs for a given unevenness, and

calculations of the horse-power absorbed in traction due to unevenness may be

founded on the indications of the instrument.

          3. A Self-registering Rain-gauge. By W. J. E. Binnie.

     This rain-gauge is constructed so as to register the rate of rainfall at any
moment by means of the drops falling into the interior of the gauge from the

orifice of the collecting funnel.

     The weight of each drop depends upon

     1. The surface tension between air and water.
     2. The dimensions of the orifice.
     3. The interval which .separates the fall of the drops.

     1. The surface tension varies with the temperature, amounting to about xaVir
per degree Fahr , giving a probable maximum error of 2^ per cent.

     3. The influence on the size of the drops of the interval between the fall of
TRANSACTtOKS 0^ SfeCtlON G.  871

each IS very marked when that interval is less than fiye seconds ; htlt the Relative

dimensions of the funnel and the orifice are so chosen that sufficient interval for

the formation of the drop is allowed even with very heavy rainfalls.
     The funnel is so arranged as to discharge into a tube containing the drop

former. From the orifice of the drop former each drop falls and impinges on a
pan carried at one end of a counter-balanced lever. The momentum of the drop

striking the pan causes that end of the lever to be depressed, so that a small
pointer rigidly attached to the lever dips into a cup of mercury, closing the
electric circuit to the receiver. The counter-balance then brings the lever back
to its original position in which the circuit is broken.

     The rain, alter falling from the pan, passes into a collecting vessel by means
of which the readings can be checked, and which would also obviate the loss of a
record in case of anything going wrong with the instrument.

    In this way each drop as it falls sends a current through to the receiver, which
may be placed anywhere.

     The receiver consists of a drum driven by clockwork, to which ia attached a
diagram in the usual manner. This diagram is divided vertically into time
intervals, and horizontally so as to read in inches of ' rainfall,' the scale being
dependent on the relative dimensions of the collecting funnel and drop former.
Each current transmitted to the receiver works an electro-magnetic escapement
in such a manner as to move a pen on the diagram through a certain space

vertically.

    By this means the total rainfall and the variations of rate of rainfall are

registered on the drum.

4. The Coal Fields and Iron Ore Deposits of the Provinces of Shansi and
    Honan and Fropos^'^ Raihvay Construction in China. By J. G. H.
     Glass, CJ.E.

     The general object of this paper was to furnish information respecting the
Opening up by British capital ot the two large provinces of Shansi and Honan,
and developing the vast and practically unparalleled mineral wealth they contain,
by the construction of a system of railways, starting from the coal-fields of Shansi
and connecting with the Yangtzi River opposite Nanking on the south-east and

the Wei River on the east, at a place called Taokou. At the proposed terminus

opposite Nanking, the Yangtzi River is open to sea-going vessels, and at Taokou,

the other terminus, the Wei River is now navigable for barges having a capacity of
from twenty-five to thirty tons as a maximum, and by the expenditure of a
moderate sum in deepening and widening certain parts, navigation would be

greatly improved. The large and commercial town of Tientsin is reached from

Taokou by means of the Wei River and the Grand Canal, on both of which there

is free navigation throughout the year, excepting for a short period in the winter

of varying duration, when it is closed by ice. The coal-fields will thus be brought
into communication with the seaboard at Nanking in the south and Tientsin in
the north. The railways will besides connect with numerous waterways inter-

secting the country traversed, most of which are navigable, afibrding a cheap and
convenient means of conveying coal, &c., to the dense population inhabiting the
Great Plain of China.

     The paper gave a description of the bituminous and anthracite coal-fields of
Shansi and Honan, visited either by the author or by members of his expedition
last year, and the approximate area of the coal-measures and contents available.
Analjses of specimens of the coal, brought to England for that purpose, were
furnished, and information given on the methods of mining adopted by the
Chinese, the output at the mines visited, and the cost at pit-head. Photographs
of a typical coal-mine, showing the workmen, coal-stacks, and the vehicles used
for transporting the coal, were shown to illustrate the paper, and maps of the
country, showing the proposed railway routes. The paper described the great

deposits of iron ores associated with the coal-fields of Shansi, and the'i general

distribution and occurrence ; analyses of them were given, and the methods fol-

lowed by the Chinese in their reduction described. Sketches were given of the

furnace employed, the manner of loading' it was explained, and details were given

of the results obtained, and an estimate was furnished of the yearly output

gathered from reliable sources, and the cost of production. The description was

illustrated by photographs. The existing means of communication by land and

water was referred to, and information collected by the writer furnished in respect

to the vehicles and pack animals used for carriage on roads, and the cost of trans-

Aporting the products of the mines under present conditions.  description,

accompanied by photographs, was given of one of the great high roads of China,

the methods of its construction and alignment, and the difficulties which it presents

to vehicular traffic briefly alluded to. Some information was also furnished

regarding wages of skilled and unskilled labour, the general condition of the

people, their food and habits, the effects of the last great famine on them, their

demeanour towards foreigners as experienced by the writer and his staff, and as

gathered from statements received personally from missionaries who have long

resided in the country, and the desire evinced, not only by the workmen them-

selves, but also by officials, to see the natural industries developed whereby regular

employment and good wages would be obtained. The implements used by the

Chinese in mining and other industries, and their methods of agriculture were

Aalluded to.  general description of the country to be traversed by the proposed

railways, its physical aspects, population, and trade, was given, and also an account

of the rivers and waterways encountered, with special reference to the Yellow

lliver, and the measures to be adopted for bridging it. The gauge on which the

railways are to be built, and the nature of the permanent way and rolling stock

were referred to, and also other matters of interest in connection with construction.

The paper also contained some remarks on existing and projected railways in

China. It concluded with some general remarks on the cost of the lines of railway

referred to, and haulage rates.

                        5. The Use of -Expanded Meted in Concrete.

                    By Arthur T. Walmisley, M.Inst.C.E.

     The author's paper began by stating that the subject of the judicious intro-
duction of iron and steel sections into concrete was a leading topic of discussion at
the present time among engineers, and he referred to the paper read at tbe Liverpool
meeting of the British Association descriptive of the manufacture of expanded
metal by Mr. J. F. Golding, the inventor of the machinery for its production, and
then dealt with its development, with special application to its introduction into
concrete for supplying that tensile element which concrete without metal lacks.
The present machinery is limited to sheets eight feet in length, but larger machines
are in contemplation for the Expanded Metal Company's works at West Hartle-
pool, to enable sheets of metal long and strong enough for spans of IK-foot
slabs to be supplied. The author assumed that the safe-working unit stress for

concrete in compression is ten times the safe-working unit stress for concrete in
tension, and pointed out that, under these circumstances, with a homogeneous
section of pure concrete having parallel sides the neutral axis must be above the
level of the centre of gravity of a slab laid horizontally or vertically ; and that,

-- --assuming as in the case of a slab supported at the edges that it is laid flat, the

neutral axis of a section divided the depth into the proportions of "24 and "76 re-
spectively in order to create a result equal to a couple in which the compressive
and tensile elements unaided by metal would be in equilibrium. The author then
gave calculations showing the effect of introducing metal into the tensile portion
pf the section, whereby the neutral axis under the above conditions of equilibrium

18 lowered, the compressive portion is increased, and the neutral axis made to
approach nearer the centre of gravity of the section. Examples were given of a
section containing wires or rods, plates, and inverted tee sections, together with a
comparison of a section containing expanded metal ; and the author pointed out

that the latter provides a uniform distribution of tensile strength in all directions,
TKANSACTIOXS OF SECTION G.  873

ample in amount without extravagance, and easily laid witliout the responsibility

of supervision in placing the material transversely at the specified distances apart,

as would be necessary in the case of separate pieces. The insertion of Avires or

individual sections gives strength in the direction of their length, leaving the inter-

mediate concrete comparatively weak. Expanded metal contributes strength
laterally both in the direction of width and length, as well as giving an effective
keyage in its depth. The coefficients of expansion of the two constituents, iron or
steel and concrete, are considered for all practical purposes to be identical. Results
of experiments made on various-size slabs were next given, the longest span without
intermediate joists being on a slab 12 ft. 6 in. by II ft. clear span, which was loaded

Hto 6j cwt. to the foot super, and bore this load for hour before it collapsed, the

fractures occurring at each of the four corners. The gradual increase of the load
and progress of deflection of the slab were related in detail.

     The adhesion of iron and concrete was found by Professor Bauschinger, of
Munich, to be about 569 to 668 pounds per square inch, but a case was quoted,
experimenting upon 2 in. diameter anchor bolts set 11^ in. in a masonry block, with
lead, sulphur, and cement, from which it was inferred that in suitable setting the
cement joint on a smooth rod might be made to fracture the rod before the adhesion
of the connection failed. The author described the introduction of the aid of
channel arches by the Expanded Metal Company. The spans were enabled to be

increased thereby, the only objection being, in the author's opinion, the exposure

of the under surface of the channel metal rib ; but the surface so exposed is com-
paratively small compared with the various systems of trough flooring that have
been patented. The result of experiments was stated in the paper, the channel
metal flat arches being firmly held between lougitudinal joists spaced at specified
intervals. The author considered that, in order to keep the portion of a slab
containing metal in tension below the neutral axis, the slab should not be fixed at its
bearings ; but he pointed out that probably there is a tendency to form a fiat arch
Avithin a concrete beam, which converts a large part of the vertical pressure into
lateral thrust, which in the case of an expanded metal section becomes a tied arch,
and that, in his opinion, a concrete beam should be viewed as a bar. with a hollow
curved soffit. Further developments of the system were reviewed, and diagrams
illustrative of the arguments propounded were exhibited, with a view to elicit
suggestions as to any desired improvement in the size of the meshes employed or

to further experiments needed.

   6. Power Generation.-- Comparative Cost by the Steam Engine, Water

        Turbine, and Gas Engine. By John B. C. Kershaw, F.I.C.

     There is no question of greater importance at the present moment to those
engaged in the management of our manufacturing industries than that of power
generation. The supremacy which the steam engine has so long enjoyed is now
assailed from two sides. The water turbine and the gas engine have become

dangerous rivals.
     During the past ten years a most remarkable development of hydraulic power

has been taking place on the continent of Europe in France and Germany, and in
America at Niagara.

     The aggregate amount of power at the present date generated from falling
water forms no inconsiderable portion of the total power utilised in manufacturing
industries ; and two years ago it was estimated by the author to be between
236,000 and 350,000 horse-power.

    On the other hand gas engineers have been busily engaged in working out the

problems presented by large gas engines and by the utilisation of the waste gases

of blast furnaces.

     Gas engines up to 650 horse-power have been built, and have worked smoothly
and economically ; while at Seraing in Belgium and at other places the blast
furnace gases have been utilised for driving the engines which supply the blast.

    The question, therefore, which the engineer now has to settle when deciding
upon the site and locality for a new factory, or when deciding upon the system of
--874 REPORT 1900*

power generation to adopt for extensions of the old, is no longet so simple as wten
only one method of power generation in large units was open to him.

     It is no doubt true that the choice between the three possible sources of power
is one which in many cases will be settled purely by local considerations ; and the
proximity of a large waterfall or of an extensive coalfield to the factory, will be
held to point to the turbine or to the steam engine as the most economical power
generator. In a great number of cases, however, especially when the decision of
the engineer covers the choice of a site for the factory, the problem is capable of
no such easy solution ; and the most economical source of power can only be
determined after an exhaustive study of comparative costs data.

     The aim of the writer in the present paper has been to collect and arrange in
compai'able form some of the more important figures bearing on the cost of power
generation. Full references are given to all the original articles from which these

figures are drawn.'

     Taking the best figures for each of the three sources of power dealt with above,

and bringing them all to a common basis of comparison, namely, the cost of the

E.H.P. year of 8,760 hours, the author obtained the figures given below.

could be industrially utilised in the manner suggested, we should to a large extent

be compensated for our lack of natural water power.
     But blast furnaces demand coke, and coal beds are exhaustible, so that even

if this source of mechanical and electrical energy be tapped it can only postpone,
but not avert, the final triumph of the waterfall and of the turbine.

1. The Automobile for Electric Street Traction. Bij J.O. W. Aldridge.

                2. The Manchester and Liverjyool Express Railway.

                           By Sir W. H. Prkege, F.R.S.

   A monorail line has been projected by Mr. Behr between Manchester and

Liverpool to accommodate express j)assenger traffic alone between those two cities.
It is to be worked by electric traction and to attain very high speeds. The train
is to consist of only one coach, weighing forty-tive tons and seating sixty-four
passengers. Starting at every ten minutes, and travelling at the mean rate of
110 miles an hour, it will do the distance of 34^ miles in twenty minutes. The
fares will be slightly lower than those charged at present. There will be no inter-
mediate stations, no points or crossings. There will thus be no necessity for
signals to protect the line during other operations. Signals would be needed
only to secure a perfect block system of working the line. The monorail railway
was projected by Lartigue in 1882.

   We have only one example of this sj-stem of railway in the United Kingdom,

viz., between Listowel and Ballybunion, in County Kerry, Ireland. This line
was designed and engineered by Mr. Behr. The Act was obtained in 1887, and the
line was opened for traffic in February, 1888, and it has been running ever since.
The line is 9^ miles long. It has one intermediate station, Liselton. There
are forty-two level and farm crossings. It is worked by steam. The train
consists of a locomotive and four coaches. It cost .3ci,000/. to build, or 3,0G0Z. per

mile. When I inspected the line in the early part of this year there had never

been a Board of Trade inquiry into any accident. The maintenance of the

structure had been effective. No rail had ever been turned. The mechanical

structure had exhibited no defects, but several breakdowns had occurred in the
locomotive and rolling stock. There are three locomotives, eleven passenger
coaches, and two brake vans. They had, however, continued to work the line

uninterruptedly for twelve years, and there had been no renewals or new stock.

Its main principle is the suspension of the coaches on a single elevated rail so
that their centres of gravity are below the rail. Each coach sits the rail like a
saddle. The rail is tixed on trestles ; which are tied and braced together, the tie
bars being light rails against which guide wheels roll.

     The Manchester and Liverpool Express is intended to be more massively and
rigidly built. Derailment on such a structure is impossible, and curves of com-
paratively small radius can be passed with safety at high speeds. Vibrations and
noise will be reduced, and travelling will be conducted with greater comfort than

at present.

     It is proposed to fix the generating station midway at Warrington, and to

transmit the electric energy at high pressure (10,000 volts) to each terminal
876 REPORT-- 1900.

station. There would be sub-stations along the line, at distances apart of fout

miles, where the 10,000 volts would be brought down to 1,000, at which pressure

it would be piekt-d up by the motors on the coach.

The speed which a train can acquire on a railway depends on the power that

can be continuously applied at the thread of the driving wheel. Electricity

enables the engineer to apply instantaneously to light loads a power which steam

cannot supply. Hence speeds are possible with electricity which are unattainable

Awith steam.  coach weighing forty-five tons can easily and quickly attain 110

mUes an hour. 1,600 horse-power will accelerate the coach so as to attain this

speed in 110 seconds, and 500 horse-power will maintain this speed on the level.

Electricity has two advantages over .steam. It enables us to obtain an accelera-

tion of I5 feet per second, which is virtually the limit that can be obtained without

causing discomfort to the passengers ; and, secondly, it applies a continuous and

constant torque instead of the variable one due to the reciprocating action of the

ordinary steam locomotive. Hence it not only enables us to maintain high speeds

on long through lines like the proposed Manchester and Liverpool Express, but it

enables us to attain high speeds with greater rapidity on short lines having

frequent stoppages, like the Sletropolitan railways of London, and thus increase

the capacity of the line for traffic.

     The chief causes of accident on ordinary railways, viz., collision, derailment,
points, and the human error of the signalman, will be removed from lines. Hence
travelling will be much safer.

3. Manchester and Liverpool Electrical Express Railway : Brakes

                     and Signals. By F. B. Beiir.

The questions of brakes and signals are so intimately connected that the one

cannot be treated separately from the other.

The most perfect condition under which a railway could be worked would be

that in which both brakes and signals could be dispensed with ; therefore it follows

th.at the I'ewer the occasions for using either, the better.

    Now as to brakes, there is a limitation of their application, which depends not

so much on the mechanical appliances themselves as on the endurance of the

passengers. It was stated by an eminent railway official to the Select Committee of

the House of Commons that with the Westinghouse brake a train travelling at 60

miles an hour could be stopped at an emergency, within 360 yards, without

inflicting too great a shock on the passengers. In the same way the proposed

traiu travelling at 110 miles an hour could be stopped within 600 yards, and

probably in a shorter distance, as in this case electrical means would be at hand,

such as the reversal of the motors, so as to turn them into dynamos. More rapid

stoppages could only be made with great discomfort to the passengers. Now in

the ordinary way of working our railways at present there are many occasions in

which it might be important to stop the train as rapidly as possible ; for instance,

if a train should be seen in front, or some shunting operations were not com-

pleted, or in some other cases too many to enumerate. But no brake, however

powerful, would be of the slightest use to-day for avoiding a sudden obstacle,

such as a stone placed on the rail, or a broken rail, for it is impossible for the

driver to be aware of such obstacles until he is practically upon them. In these

cases, therefore, the power of stopping at 300, or 200, or even 100 yards is quite

useless.

The author then stated that on the proposed high-speed electrical railways,

though it is quite possible to stop the train within less than 500 yards, it never can

be necessary to bring it to a standstill at even a much longer distance.

On the proposed railway there will be no level crossings, no switches, no

.shunting operations, and in fact nothing that will require the train to be

brought to a standstill unless a preceding train should break down. Besides

this one case, the brakes can only be used for stopping as you approach the

Astations.  broken rail produces no danger whatever, for the train would run

over it without any risk or difficulty. This can easily be shown by carefully
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                      877

considering the relative position of the wheels of the carriages to the rails over

which they travel.
     It remained, therefore, only to explain the manner in which it is arranged

that the driver of each train shall be informed of the possible stoppage of the

train in front of him.

     Under normal conditions no second train will leave the station at Manchester
or Liverpool until the first has reached Wan-ington, a distance of over 17 miles.

     The line will be subdivided for the purpose of signalling into eight sections
of 4'3 miles each. As a train leaves Manchester or Liverpool a danger signal is
put up automatically at that station, and a second similar danger signal is put
up in the same way at 4-3 miles off, the first remaining at danger. The train travels
on until it reaches 8-6 miles, when it puts up a third danger signal, and simul-
taneously the signal is lowered at Manchester or Liverpool, so that the second

train can now leave.

     Assuming that the first train has met with an accident after passing the point
distant 8 6 miles, the second train would travel at full speed until it passes point
4'3 miles. The danger signal at that point not having been removed by the first
train, as it never reached point 13 miles, the driver of the second train would be
informed that the first train had met with an accident between 8-6 miles and 13
miles, and therefore that he has to slow down, but that for such lowerin<r of his
speed he has a clear run of over four miles. Therefore, there could be no difficulty
in stopping without iising the brake at all by simply cutting off' the current.

     Whenever a train passes over a point wlaere the danger signal is put up this is
reproduced, either electrically or mechanically, by a very simple and inexpensive
contrivance in the cabin of the driver, so that he would be perfectly able to see it

without difficulty even if there was a thick fog.
     Under these conditions of travelling it seems, therefore, superfluous to have any

emergency brakes ; and though it will be possible to stop the trains within 500
yards, no "ease can be imagined in which it would be useful or necessary to resort

to such a stoppage.

   A six minutes' service of trains could be established without any alteration i u

the proposed arrangement, and if a three minutes' service was required the blocks
would have to be reduced to two-mile sections, giving a clear run of two miles in

case of a breakdown.

         Exhibition. By Professor S. P. Thompson, F.R.S.

   G. Measurement of the Tractive Force, Resistance, and Acceleration of
                              Trains. By A. Mallock.

    The author described in the paper some experiments recently made on electric

and other railways, the object of the experiments being to determine the accelera-
tion, tractive force, and running resistKUce to which the trains are subjpct.

     The appli;ince used wms a short pendulum whose free vibrations are adequately
damped. It' this is suspended on the moving body it will hang in t'le direciion
which is the resultnnt of gravity and the acceleration which the b'dy at tlie time
experiences; hence the an^'-le which such a pendulum makes with the vertical
gives t'le measufe of the accelerations at ea h instant.

     Ill the exp.-riinents the pendulum was arrangeil so as to record its posit'on on
uniformly moving paper, on which at the same time seconds were marked by an
.elective clock, and a contact marker, worked from one of the wheels of the carriage,
Cfiused a second pen to record each revolution performed by the wheel.. The
878 · REPOKT-- 1900.

diaoram tlius obtained gives a direct measure of the speed and acceleration of tlie

carriage.

     The author showed that pendulum ohservations, combined with a record of
speed and power supplied, offer a simple and eil'ective means of determining tha
resistance to, and efficiency of, electric or other kinds of motor vehicles.

   7. On a Combination integrating Wattmeter and Maximum Demand
                             Indicator. By T. Barker.

    The paper fully sets forth the advantages of the maximum demand system of

--charn-ing for the supply of electricity, and describes a new meter the invention

--of Messrs. Barker and Ewing to be used for this purpose. The paper was illus-

trated by diagrams, and examples of the meter were exhibited.
     In charging for the supply of electricity it has become usual to make a dis-

tinction in the prices charged to those consumers who use a few lights for many
hours per day and those who use many lights for an hour or less ; for, although at
the end of the year the number of unirs consumed may be the same in both cases,
the cost to the company or corporation in macliiuery, mains, and every other charge
will be in the ratio of the number of lamps lighted at one time. The consumer
who uses a few lamps for many hours should be charged at a less rate per unit in

view of the smaller capital expenditure wliich his supply involves.
     The late Dr. Hopkinson advocated a system which takes account of this con-

sideration in arriving at the fair price to be charged for current. In the system in

question, now known as the ' Maximum Demand System,' the total quantity of

electricity consumed in six months is measured in the usual way, and the greatest
rate at which the consumer has been taking current is also recorded. If the con-
sumer in the six months' period takes a smaller total than would correspond to
one hour a day at the greatest rate of demand, he is charg'^d the full price per
unit, but if the total consumption exceeds this he is charged a reduced rate for

each unit in excess.

     The system has been used with marked success in some seventy-two towns.
It has improved the load factor, and has enabled a large number of additional

units to be sold without increase of station plant or mains. Until the introduc-

tion of Barker and Ewings Demand Indicator it was necefsary to use two meters

--one to record the total number of units taken by the consumer and the other to

sliow his maximum rate of demand.
     The Barker and Ewing Indicator forms an integral part of the ordinary meter,

and absorbs no energy ; it further records watts and not amperes. With an alter-
nating supply it shows actual watts and not apparent watts, an important diti'erence
in the case of motors and arc-lamps. It is not affected by any ordinary short circuit,

its time lag being sufficient to prevent it coming into action. The Indicator may
be used to show the actual rate of demand at any instant in place of recording the
maximum rate of demand. In this form it is specially useful in switchboard

instruments, showing the attendant the rate at which electric energy is passing
through a feeder or is supplied from a dynamo at any instant. The meter also
serves at the same time to integrate the total amount which has passed through
that particular feeder or machine.

          8. The Design and Location of Electric Generating Stations.
                         ISy Alfred H. Gibbings, M.Inst.E.E.

     The term ' central station ' is gradually being supplanted by more comprehen-

sive designations.

     All design and arrangement in regard to electric works must be with a view-
to securing the highest average efficiency together with reliability in operation.

Electric works at present do not fulfil these conditions, but that may excusably

be accounted for because it was impossible to foresee modern developments.
Electricity, at first used for lighting only, has now come to be used in the form
                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                    879

of electric motive power and electric traction. The attempt to supply all these
from one generating station has led to the use of unsuitable plant, to confusion in
the station itself, but at the same time to a reduction in prices charged. It has

also resulted in a large variation in capital cost per kilowatt of plant. Small and
isolated undertakings trj' to attain equally successful results by other experiments,
but fail. Economical production is only possible where both the generating costs
and the standing charges are reduced together as the load increases and the system
extends. To etFect this generating works must in future be constructed and
located witli a view to include the supply of energy for motive power, tramways,
and electro-chemical purposes. Details of such construction and location should
embody the following points :

     (1) The machinery must be designed to generate at high voltage, differing
according to the extent of the area and the nature of the system, but it must be
suitable for transformation at sub-stations to meet all possible requirements.

     (2) The type of all boilers, engines, electric generators, switchboards, &c., must
be simple and mechanically reliable, even at the sacrifice of some slight maximum
economy.

     (3) All complicated gear and fanciful combinations, such as might lead to
possible breakdown, must be avoided throughout the eutire arrangement.

     (4) As far as possible the difl'erent units of the respective types of plant should
be uniform in design and arrangement and made to one standard size, thus econo-
mising in labour, avoiding large ' stand-by' plant and spare gear.

     (o) The buildings should be devoid of all unnecessary embellishments, nor
should an attempt be made to confine too many departments under one roof.

     (6) The location should be such as to ensure a cheap and ready supply and
delivery of fuel, and where condensing can be accomplished efticiently and

inexpensively.

The following Report and Papers were read :

2. On Screiv Threads tised in Cycle Construction, and for Scretvs subject to
                           Vibration. By O. P. Clements.

     The Chairman of the Screw Gauge Committee of this Association has honoured

me by the request that I would contribute a short paper on screw threads which,
in my experience, have proved to be the most suitable for use in cycle construction

and for screws that are subject to vibration. In complying with this request I

propose to confine myself chiedy to the consideration of what is of most importance

in tills connection, namely, the shape of the threads. The time limit allowed for

this paper would be inadequate for dealing exhaustively with such matters as

pitch in relation to diameters, interchangeability, and gauging.

    In my opinion it would be impossible to devise a standard thread suitable for all

classesof work and the various conditions of use. At piesent there are not only

standard threads differing so much in shape as the Whitworth and the American,

but also a large number of bastard threads, differing in shape from either of these,

and which have been adopted in most instances as a matter of expediency and
Anecessity.
             too slavish use of a standard thread has no doubt often been the

cause of much mischief and inconvenience in its adaptation to purposes /or which

it was unsuitable.

    When Sir Joseph Whitworth framed his system of threads and pitches he

had not at his command the superior quality of steel for the mHnufacture of
screws which we have in the present day. If he had, I venture to think that his

system would have been somewhat modified both in shape of thread and in pitch.
880 REPORT-- 1900.

I think that the correctness of these views cannot be better demonstrated than

by showing what is the general practice and experience with regard to screws

used in the gun trade. lu both sporting guns and military rifles the screws are

subject to severe vibration as well as sudden strains, and are therefore extremely

liable to work loose. To obviate this the gunmaker uses a thread vs^ith a

·well rounded top, and care is taken that the whole of the thread fits well, but more

especially the top of the thread, where the frictional contact on the greatest

Wecircumferential portion of the screw will prevent Liosening.  have thus a thread

that differs from any recognised standard. It is shallow, with a large angle of

the sides generally about G0°, and is admirably suited for the purpose of resisting

vibration.

    I will now refer to a shape of thread which merits consideration, namely, flat-
topped threads, which are very suitable for many purposes. It is also a shape of
thread to which most accurate gauges can be made ; but while admitting their un-

doubted suitability for gauge making, I must remark that gauges for threads with
rounded tops can also be made satisfactorily, for all practical purposes, both as

regards size and form, and so as to be perfectly reversible. Such gauge making,

however, certainly requires a skill and experience which can be attamed in but few

tool shops. The flat-topped thread can be most accurately formed with a single

tool on the ordinary screw-cutting lathes, or on machines having a leading
screw or former. The tool can be easily ground to correct shape, and so as to

have the cutting clearance which is necessary for the durability of the tool and

for the production of clean and accurate work.

There are, however, serious objections to the adoption of such a thread for

screws used in cycle work, and for screws subject to viljration. It is certain

that the flat-topped thread cannot give the frictional resistance to vibration

which is the case with the round top ; and in the economical production of
such work it would be very difficult to maintain the correct shape of the

thread. In this production, screwing dies are chiefly used, and these tools show

the first and most rapid wear on the parts forming the sharp edges or corners

of the thread. For this reason it will be found a serious matter to keep up

the screwing tackle, male and female, in the proper working condition necessary to

produce flat-topped threads, especially if they should have a small angle of the

sides. I am regarding this matter from the commercial point of view, that is,

the production of work in quantities to be profitable and accurate, so far as

accuracy is commercially possible.

    In my experience the most favourable shape of thread for production with

screwing dies and taps is a shallow thread with a large angle of the sides.

AHThis will give the best cutting clearance in the screwing tools.  the faults and

errors in screw threads, and the difficulties in manufacture, can generally be

traced to the bad cutting clearance in screwing dies and taps for high threads with

small angles of the sides. Thus, through the strain put on the sides of such

threads, there is a liability to breakage of the threads on the sci'ewing dies

and taps, and it also causes the screw to elongate and produces a fewer number of
threads to the inch than standard pitch requires. This pitch error is a most

serious fault, as the strain which should be distributed over all the threads is

often taken by only one or two of them.

     Owing to the rapid wear of dies and taps with a bad cutting clearance, a
faulty shape of thread is produced, especially at the sides of the thread. The

angle of the male thread is often different from that of the female thread, and,

in such case, the bearing surface at t'le sides of the thread is, of course, con-

siderably rf-daced. This fault is especially si-riousin long-sided threads.

    The spreading or elongation of the thread i-* another matter whii'h I may here

refer to. [t is found necessars in tapping holes ro drill or reara^^r the hole larger

'than the bnttom of the thread on t!ie male screw. In the ])rocess ot tapping, the

thread elongates so as to fill the cavities between the threads and the tap, and

upon the completion of the operation the hole will be found to be considerably

smaller than when the tap was first inserted. This elongation also occurs in

the male thread, but to a less degree, and if proper allo!\-ance for it is neglected,
          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.      881

ripping of the threads will be caused. Much depends, also, on the material to

be operated upon. In mild steel the elongation is more than in hard steel ·
in brass and gun metal rather more than in mild steel; and in cast iron it is'

considerably leas than in either of the other metals mentioned. Further in
threads with a small angle of the sides it is considerably more than in those havino°-
a large angle.

     The screws used in cycle construction are subject to even more continuous
vibration than gun screws, but owing also to the low margin of safety in cycle

·work, it has been found necessary to use shallow threads, so as to give the

greatest possible strength to the core, and to obtain a large angle of the sides
of thread, which especially is important, as a large number of parts are har-
dened, and therefore the greatest possible strength of thread is necessary.
While a few firms use the Whitworth thread exclusively, others use a shallow

thread, as before described, in a portion of their component parts, with Whitworth
threads in the remainder. With the exception of two instances, as will be seen
from the attached list, the shallow thread is adopted throughout for B.S.A.

cycle components. Time, however, will not permit me to give the reasons why a

different thread is used in the two exceptions, but they illustrate the necessity
which sometimes arises for the adoption of a different thread to suit altered

conditions.

    The ' B.S.A.' thread is now extensively adopted as a standard in the cycle
trade, and although the B.S.A. Company make all their own screws, the screw
manufacturers to the trade have found it necessary to make the ' B.S.A.' standard

a staple article of their trade, and tool makers have also now a marketable article

in taps, dies, and chasers for the * B.S.A.' thread.

The illustration which was exhibited gave the section of the ' B.S.A.' thread, and
Afor comparison also sections of the British Association, the Whitworth, and the Seller
threads.  list of the diameters, pitches, &c., of the screws used in the ' B.S.A.'

cycle components was also given. It is to be noted that the angle of the ' B.S A.'

thread_is_60°, with tops and bottoms rounded to a radius of one-sixth of the pitch,
and this is practically the shape of the thread used for the screws of the Lee-Enfield
Magazine Rifle, which is manufactured for Her Majesty's Government by the B.S. 1.
Company.

            3. The Photographic Method of jyreparing Textile Designs.

By Professor Roberts Beaumont, M.I.Mech.E., Yorkshire Collecje, Leeds.

    The preparation of designs for the loom has, throughout the history of
weaving, been regarded as a purely manual process controlled by the intellio-ence,

ingenuity, and skill of the craftsman. It is only natural, therefore, that the

invention of apparatus for this specific purpose should have created much interest

amongst both British and foreign textile experts. Photography, as understood
and practised, appeared as incapable of aiding the artist in the actual paintintr of
his picture as the designer in the transference and execution of the plain sketch of
the pattern on to the ' scale ' paper for the loom. Within the wide range of
technical and scientific data ia the construction and embellishment of woven

fabrics there is, perhaps, no phase of the work more difiicult to assail, by
mechanical devices, than the application and adjustment of the manifold 'weave'
units which compose all figured textiks.

theoretical or technical form, for in both processes the knowledge of the expert

is demanded ; but its province is to lessen, and, in some instances, dispense with,

the monotonous manual labour necessitated by the present system. There are larjje

areas of point paper in elaborate designs to which the same weave effect has to be

applied, and where some labour-saving device is much needed. Further, in the

enlargement of the artist's sketch to scale there is much mechanical work that it

ought to be possible to reduce. The photographic inventions of Szczepanik profess

to accomplish these objects, and the designs submitted prove that there are
Apossibilities of succfss in certain styles of pattern.
                                                                        new field for experiment

has been discovered, the extent of which it is not possible to forecast, but it may

reasonably be anticipated that the genius and temerity of the disco vei'er will prove

equal to its more complete exploration.

The essential purpose of Szczepnnik's invention is to develop from the ordinary

sketch and enlarge to a prescribed scale the technically prepared design, marked

with the thousands, or may be millions, of dots grouped in different orders and so fitted

together as to impart precise definition to the several portions of the woven figure

or design. The process is threefold, consisting (1) of the preparation of the ruled

paper                          (2)  the development of the design from  an ordinary photographic negative
                            ;                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and (.3) the application of the weave units to the several parts of the figure.

Primarily the apparatus consists of an optical lantern with a suitable arrangement

of lenses. One important factor is the ' raster ' or multiplying plate, containing
some 435,600 perforations, through each of which the weave type passes, and is

printed on the enlarged design. In addition there are weave- plates for determin-

ing the details of the pattern, and small metal slides for producing particular

sections in distinct forms of type, so that they may be as readily distinguished

from each other as if sketched in various colours.

The light from the lantern passes through the negative of the design, entering

a pair of lenses between which is fixed the small metal plate of the proper shape
for developing the marks on the sensitised pHper. The process consists in dividing
and subdividing the ' scale ' pattern into rectangular spaces, and of marking each

with the correct weave type. When there is no negative in the lantern this type

is repeated as many times as there are holes in the ' raster,' showing the

feasibility of marking every square photographically on any kind of weaver's

paper.

     In the first place, the negative is made of the complete design, and all parts

erased but the ground sections, allowing of these being printed with their supple-

mentary weave elements. Negatives of every part of the pattern are similarly

printed in succession until the entire design has been obtained. For the production

of shaded work, e.g. portraits and pictorial subjects, selecting plates are employed.
These secure an accurate graduation of tones perfectly in harmony with the

photograph from which they are derived. Provision is made for the execution of

patterns in compound as well as in single structure fabrics ; but it follows, the more

complex the build of the texture, the more intricate the process of design produc-

tion. Certain textile designs may evidently be produced photographically by the
Szczepanik system, so that it is now a question for demonstration whether

designs so produced are comparable in legibility and equal for all practical

-- --purposes as forcible in detail, as vit^l in execution to those prepared by the

much slower hand method.

             By William George Walker, A.M.I.C.E., M.I.M.E.

      Considerable economy can be obtained by reheating compressed air before

 admitting it to the engine.

      Reheating is accomplished by two methods :

     1. By passing the air through hot pipes heated by a furnace fire.
     2. By passing the compressed air through water in a boiler at a temperature

depending on the pressure in the boiler.

     The author and Mr. P. Y. Alexander have investigated these methods
Generally speaking, the results show that an additional horse-power can be
obtained with an expenditure of one pound of coal, which is more efficient than
the most economical engine and boiler using steam.

    The experiments show that in many cases it would prove advantageous to use

compressed air in conjunction with steam in an ordinary engine.

                     Section H,--ANTHROPOLOGY.

          Pbesident of the Seciioit--Professor John Khxs, M,A., LL.D.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.

      The President delivered the following Address:

Perhaps I ought to begin by apologising for my conspicuous lack of qualifica-

tion to fill this cliair, but I prefer, with your permission, to dismiss that as a

subject far too large for me to dispose of this morning. So I would beg to call
your attention back for a moment to the excellent address given to this Section

last year. It was full of practical suggestions which are well worth recalling : one
was as to the project of a Bureau of Ethnology for Greater Britain, and the other
turned on the desirability of founding an Imperial Institution to represent our vast
Colonial Empire. I mention these things in the hope that we shall not leave the
Government and others concerned any peace till we have realised those modest
dreams of enlightenment. People's minds are just now so full of other things that
the interests of knowledge and science are in no little danger of being overlooked.
So it is all the more desirable that the British Association, as our great parliament
of science, should take the necessary steps to prevent that happening, and to keep
steadily before the public the duties which a great and composite nation like ours
owes to the world and to humanity, whether civilised or savage.

     The difficulties of the position of the president of this Section arise in a great

measure from the vastness of the field of research which the Science of Man covers.
He is, therefore, constrained to limit his attention as a rule to some small corner

of it ; and, with the audacity of ignorance, I have selected that which might be
labelled the early ethnology of the British Isles, but I propose to approach it only

along the precarious paths of folklore and philology, because I know no other.

Here, however, comes a personal difficulty: at any rate I suppose I ought to
pretend that I feel it a difficulty, namely, that 1 have committed myself to
publicity on that subject already. But as a matter of fact, 1 can hardly bring

myself to confess to any such feeling ; and this leads me to mention in passing

mythe change of attitude which I have lived to notice in the case of students in

position. Most of us here present have known men who, when they had

once printed their views on their favourite subjects of study, stuck to those views
through thick and thin, or at most limited themselves to changing the place of a

comma here and there, or replacing an occasional and by a but. The work had then
been made perfect, and not a few great questions afiecting no inconsiderable portions

of the universe had been for ever set at rest. That was briefly the process of

getting ready for posterity, but one of its disadvantages was that those who

adopted it had to waste a good deal of time in the daily practice of the art of
fencing and winning verbal victories ; for, metaphorically speaking,

Now all that, however amusing it may have heen, has been changed, and what

ABnow happens is somewhat as follows :  makes an experiment or propounds

ABwhat he calls a working hypothesis ; but no sooner has  done so than CD, who

is engaged in the same sort of research, proceeds to improve on AB. This,

AB CDinstead of impelling    with all kinds of epithets, and insinuating
              to rush after

that his character is deficient in all the ordinary virtues of a man and a brother,

only makes him go to work again and see whether he cannot improve on CD's

results ; and most likely he succeeds, for one discovery leads to another. So we

have the spectacle not infrequently of a man illustrating the truth of the poet's

belief,

              · That men may rise on stepping-stones

               Of their dead selves to higher things.'

It is a severe discipline in which all display of feeling is considered bad form. Of
course every now and then a spirit of the ruder kind discards the rules of the game

and attracts attention by having public fits of bad temper ; but generally speaking
the rivalry goes on quietly enough to the verge of monotony, with the net result

that the stock of knowledge is increased. I may be told, however, that while

this kind of exercise may be agreeable to the ass who writes, it is not conducive

to the safety of the publisher's chickens. To that it might suffice to answer that

the publisher is usually one who is well able to take good care of his chickens

hut, seriously, what it would probably mean is, that in the matter of the more pro-

gressive branches of study, smaller editions of the books dealing with them would be

required, but a more frequent issue of improved editions of them or else new books

altogether, a state of things to which the publisher would probably find ways of

adapting himself without loss of profit. And after all, the interests of know-

ledge must be reckoned uppermost. It is needless to say that I have in view only a

class of books which literary men proper do not admit to be literature at all ; and

the book trade has one of its mainstays, beyond all doubt, in books of pure litera-

ture, which are like the angels that neither marry nor give in marriage : they go on

for ever in their serene singleness of purpose to charm and chasten the reader's

mind.

My predecessor last year alluded to an Oxford don said to have given it as his

conviction, that anthropology rests on a foundation of romance. I have no notion

who that Oxford don may have been, but I am well aware that Oxford dons have

sometimes a knack of using very striking language. In this case, however, I

should be inclined to share to a certain extent that Oxford don's regard for

romance, holding as I do that the facta of history are not the only facts deserving

of careful study by the anthropologist. There are also the facts of fiction, and to

some of those I would now call your attention. Recently, in putting together

a volume on AVelsh folklore, I had to try to classify and analyse in my mind the

Nowstories which have been current in Wales about the fairies.  the mass of

folklore about the fairies is of various origins. Thus with them have been more or

less inseparably confounded certain divinities or demons, especially various kinds

of beings associated with the rivers and lakes of the country. They are creations

introduced from the workshop of the imagination ; then there is the dead ancestor,

who also seems to have contributed his share to the sum total of our notions about

the Little People. In far the greater number of cases, however, we seem to have

something historical, or, at any rate, something which may be contemplated as

historical. The key to the fairy idea is that there once was a real race of people

to whom all kinds of attributes, possible and impossible, have been given in the

course of uncounted centuries of story-telling by races endowed with a lively

imagination.

When the mortal midwife has been fetched to attend on a fairy mother in a

fairy palace, she is handed an ointment which she is to apply to the fairy baby's

eyes, at the same time that she is gravely warned not to touch her own eyes with

it. Of course any one can foresee that when she is engaged in applying the

ointment to the young fairy's eyes one of her own eyes is certain to itch and have

the benefit of the forbidden salve. When this happens the midwife has two very

different views of iier surroundings : with the untouched eye she sees that she iH

in the finest and grandest place that she has ever beheld in her life, and there she

can see the lady on whom she is attending reposing on a bed, while with the
anointed eye she perceives how she is lying on a bundle of ruslies and withered

ferns in a large cave, with big stones all round her and a little fire in one

corner, and she also discovers that the woman is a girl who has once been

her servant. Like the midwife we have also to exercise a sort of double vision,

Anif we are to understand the fairies and see through the stories about them.

instance will explain what I mean : Fairy women are pretty generally represented

as fascinating to the last degree and gorgeously dressed : that is how they

appear through the glamour in which they move and have their being. On the

other hand, not only are some tribes of some fairies described as ugly, but fairy

children when left as changelings are pictured invariably as repulsive urchins of a
sallow complexion and mostly deformed about the feet and legs : there we have

the real fairy with the glamour taken off and a certain amount of depreciatory

exaggeration put on.

    Now when one approaches the fairy question in this kind of way, one is forced,

it strikes me, to conclude that the fairies, as a real people, consisted of a short,

stumpy, swarthy race, which made its habitations underground or otherwise

cunningly concealed. They were hunters, probably, and fishermen ; at any rate
they were not tillers of the ground or eaters of bread. Most likely they had some

of the domestic animals and lived mainly on milk and the produce of the chase,

together with what they got by stealing. They seem to have practised the art
of spinning, though they do not appear to have thought much of clothing. They
had no tools or implements made of metal. They had probably a language

of their own, which would imply a time when they understood no other and
explain why, when they came to a town to do their marketing, they laid down
the exact money without uttering a syllable to anybody by way of bargaining for

their purchases. They counted by fi.ves and only dealt in the simplest of numbers.

They were inordinately fond of music and dancing. They had a marvellously

quick sense of hearing, and they were consummate thieves : but their thieving was

not systematically resented, as their visits were held to bring luck and prosperity.

More powerful races generally feared them as formidable magicians who knew the

future and could cause or cure disease as they pleased. The fairies took pains to

conceal their names no less than their abodes, and when the name happened to be

discovered by strangers the bearer of it usually lost heart and considered himself

beaten. Their family relations were of the lowest order : they not only reckoned

no fathers, but it may be that, like certain Australian savages recently described

by Spencer and Gillen, they had no notion of paternity at all. The stage of

civilisation in which fatherhood is of little or no account has left evidence of itself

in Celtic literature, as I shall show presently ; but the other and lower stage

anterior to the idea of fatherhood at all comes into sight only in certain bits of

folklore, both Welsh and Irish, to the effect that the fairies were all women and

girls. Where could such an idea have originated ? Only, it seems to me, among
a race once on a level with the native Australians to whom I have alluded, and

of whom Frazer of * the Golden Bough ' wrote as follows in last year's ' Fort-

nightly Review:' 'Thus, in the opinion of these savages, every conception is

what we are wont to call an immaculate conception, being brought about by the

entrance into the mother of a spirit, apart from any contact with the other sex.

Students of folklore have long been familiar with the notions of this sort occurring

in the stories of the birth of miraculous personages, but this is the first case on

record of a tribe who believe in immaculate conception as the sole cause of the
Abirth of every human being who comes into the world.
                                                       people so ignorant of

the most elementary of natural processes may well rank at the very bottom of the

savage scale.' Those are Dr. Frazer's words, and for a people in that stage of

ignorance to have imagined a race all women seems logical and natural enough

but for no other. The direct conclusion, however, to be drawn from this argu-

-- --ment is that some race possibly more than one which has contributed to the

folklore about our fairies, has passed through the stage of ignorance just indicated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but as an indirect inference one would probably be right in supposing' this race

to have been no other than the very primitive "one which has been e"xaggerated
into fairies. At the same time it must be admitted that they could not have been
singular always in this respect among the nations of antiquity, as is amply proved

by the prevalence of legends about virgin mothers, to whom Frazer alludes,

not to mention certainwild stories such as some of those recorded by the naturalist

Pliny concerning certain kinds of animals.

Some help to make out the real history of the Little People may be derived

from the names given them, of which the most common in Welsh is that of

y Tylwyth Teg or the Fair Family. But the word cor, ' a dwarf,' feminine corres,

is also applied to them                                                                                       and in  Breton we have  the    same word    with such deriva-
                                                                                                           ;

tives as korrik, ' a fairy, a wee little wizard or sorcerer,' with a feminine korrigan

or korrigez, analogously meaning a she-fairy or a diminutive witch. From cor we
have in Welsh the name of a people called the Corannians figuring in a story in
the fourteenth-century manuscript of the Red Book of Hergest. There one learns

that the Corannians were such consummate magicians that they could hear every
word that reached the wind, as it is put ; so they could not be harmed. The name
Corannians of those fairies has suggested to Welsh writers a similar explanation

of the name of a real people of ancient Britain. I refer to the doritani, whom

Ptolemy located, roughly speaking, between the river Trent and Norfolk, assigning
to them the two towns of Lindum, Lincoln, and Rata, supposed to have^been

approximately where Leicester now stands. It looks as if all invaders from

the Continent had avoided the coast from Norfolk up to the neighbourhood of the
Humber, for the good reason, probably, that it afl'orded very few inviting landing-

places. So here presumably the ancient inhabitants may have survived in suffi-

cient numbers to have been called by their neighbours of a different race 'the
dwarfs
                                        or  Coritani,  as                                                     late  as  Ptolemy's  time  in  the  second  century.  This
                                    '_

harmonises with the fact that the Coritani are not mentioned as doing anything,

all political initiative having long before probably passed out of their^hands into
Howthose of a more powerful race.
                                                                                                                        far inland the Coritanian territory extended
it is impossible to say, but it may have embraced the northern half of North-
amptonshire, where we have a place-name Pytchley, from an earlier Pihtes lea,
meaning 'The Pict's Meadow,' or else the meadow of a man called Pict. At all

events, their country took in the fen district containing Croyland, where towards

the end of the seventh century St. Guthlac set up his cell on the side of an
ancient tumulus and was disturbed by demons that talked Welsh. Certain portions

of the Coritanian country offered, as one may infer, special advantages as a home

for retreating nationalities: witness as late as the eleventh century the resistance

offered by Hereward in the Isle of Ely to the Norman Conqueror and his mail-

clad warriors.

In rea.soning backwards from the stories about the Little People to a race in
some respects on a level with Australian savages, we come probably in contact
with one of the very earliest populations of these islands. It is needless to say

that we have no data to ascertain how long that occupation may have been

uncontested, if at all, or what progress was made in the course of it : perhaps

archaeology will be able some day to help us to form a guess on that subject. But
the question more immediately pressing for answer is, with what race outside
Wales may one compare or identify the ancient stock caricatured in Welsh fairy
tales ? Now, in the lowlands of Scotland, together with the Orknevs and Shet-

lands, the place of our fairies is to some extent taken by the Picts', or, as they

are there colloquially called, 'the Pechts.' IMy information about the Pechts
comes mostly from recent writings on the subject by iMr. David MacRitchie, of

Edinburgh, from whom one learns, among other things, that certain underground--

or partially underground--habitations in                                                                                Scotland are          ascribed to the  Pechts.

covered with grass, so as presumably not to attract attention, an object which was
^rther helped by making the entrance very low and as inconsfiicuous as possible.
But one of the most remarkable things about them is the fact that the cells or

apartments into which they are divided are frequently so small that their inmatea

must have been of very short stature, like our Welsh fairies. Thus, though there

appears to be no reason for regarding the northern Picts themselves aa an under-

sized race, there must have been a people of that description in their country,

I'erhaps archfeologists may succeed in classifying the ancient habitations in the

North accordingly : that is, to tell us what class of them were built by the Picts

ttfld what by the Little People whom they may be supposed to have found in posses-

sion of that part of oui island.

In Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland the fairies derive their more usual

appellations from a word sid or sitk (genitive side), which may perhaps be akin to

the Latin sedes and have meant a seat, settlement, or station ; but whatever its

exact meaning may have originally been, it came to be applied to the hillocks or

mounds within which the Little People made their abodes. Thus Aes Side as a

name for the fairies may be rendered by mound people or hill folk fer side, ' a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

fairy man/ by a mound man ; and be7i side by a mound woman or banshee. They

were also called simply side, which would seem to be an adjective closely allied

with the simpler word sid.

But to leave this question of their names, let me direct your attention for a

moment to one of the most famous kings of the fairies of ancient Erin : he was

called Mider of Bri Li^ith, said to be a hill to the west of Ardagh, in the present

county of Longford. There he had his mound, to which he once carried the queen

of Eochaid Airem, monarch of Ireland. It was some time before Eochaid could

discover what had become of her, and he ordered Dalan, his druid, to find it out.

So the druid, when he had been unsuccessful for a whole year, prepared four twigs

of yew and wrote on them in Ogam. Then it was revealed to him through his

keys of seership and through the Ogam writing, that the queen was in the sid of

Bri L(5ith, having been taken thither by Mider. By this we are probably to

understand that the druid sent forth the Ogam twigs as letters of enquiry to other

druids in different parts of the country ; but in any case he was at last successful,
and his king hurried at the head of an army to Bri Ldith, where they began in

earnest to demolish Mider's mound. At this Mider was so frightened that he sent

the queen forth to her husband, who then departed, leaving the fairies to digest

their wrath                                                for it is characteristic of them  that they did not fight, but  bided their

time for revenge, which in this case did not come till long after Eochaid's day.

Now, with regard to the fairy king, one is not told, so far as I can call to mind,

that he was a dwarf, but the dwarfs were not far off; for we read of an Irish

satirist who is represented as notorious for his stinginess, and who, to emphasise the

description of his inhospitable habits, is said to have taken from Mider three of his

dwarfs and stationed them around his own house, in order that their truculent looks

and rude words might repel any of the men of Erin who might come seeking hospita-

lity or bringing any other inconvenient request. The word used for dwarf in this

story is co?t, which is usually the Irish for a crane or heron, but here, and in spme

other instances, which I cannot now discuss, it seems to have been identical with the

Brythonic cor, ' a dwarf.' It is remarkable, moreover, that the role assigned to

the three Irish co7'rs is much the same as that of the dwarf of Edern son of

Nudd, in the Welsh story of Geraint and Enid and Chretien de Troies' Erec,

which characterises him Bls/cI et de pufeire, 'treacherous and of an evil kind.'

    By way of summarising these notes on the Mound Folk I may say that I

should regard them as isolated and wretched remnants of a widely spread race

possessing no political significance whatsoever. But, with the inconsistency

characteristic of everything connected with the fairies, one has on the other hand
to admit, that this strange people seems to have exercised on the Celts probably

-- --on other races as well a sort of permanent spell of mysteriousness and awe

stretching to the verge of adoration. In fact, Irish literature states that the pagan

tribes of Erin before the advent of St. Patrick used to worship the side or the

fairies. Lastly the Celt's faculty of exaggeration, combined with his incapacity

to comprehend the weird and uncanny population of the mounds and caves of his

country, has enabled him, in one way or another, to bequeath to the great litera-

tures of Western Europe a motley train of dwarfs and little people, a whole world

of wizardry, and a vast wealth of utopianism. If you subtracted from English.

literature, for example, all that has been contributed to its vast stores from this
native source, you would find that you left a wide and unwelcome void.

     But the question must present itself sooner or later, with what race outside

these islands we are to compare or identify our mound-dwellers. I am not pre-
pared to answer, and I am disposed to ask our archaeologists what they think. In
the meantime, however, I may say that there are several considerations which
would impel me to think of the Lapps of the North of Europe. But even supposing

an identity of origin could be made out as between our ancient mound-inhabiting

race and the Lapps, which, I am told, is craniologically impossible, it would
remain still doubtful whether we could expect any linguistic help from Lapland.
The Lapps now speak a language belonging to the Ugro-Finuic family, but the

Lapps are not of the same race as the Finns ; so it is possible that the Lapps have

adopted a Finnish language and that they did so too late for their present language
to help us with regard to any of our linguistic difficulties. One of these lies in

--our topography : take for instance only the names of our rivers and brooks there

is probably no county in the kingdom that would be too small to supply a dozen
or two which would baffle the cleverest Aryan etymologist you could invite to

explain them ; and why ? Because they belong in all probability to a non-Celtic,

Don-Aryan language of some race that had early possession of our islands. Never-

theless it is very desirable that we should have full lists of such names, so as to

see which of them recur and where. It is a subject deserving the attention of

this Section of the British Association.

    We have now loitered long enough in the gloom of the Pecht's house : let us

leave the glamour of the fairies and see whether any other race has had a footing
in these islands before the coming of the Celts. In August 1891 Professor Sayce

and I spent some fine days together in Kerry and other parts of the south-west of

Ireland. He was then full of his visits to North Africa, and he repeatedly assured
me that, if a number of Berbers from the mountains had been transferred to a village

in Kerry and clad as Irishmen, he would not have been able to tell them by their
looks from native Irishmen such as we saw in the course of our excursions. This

seemed to me at the time all the more remarkable as his reference was to fairly

tall, blue-eyed persons whose hair was rather brown than black. Evidence to the
same effect might now be cited in detail from Pi'ofessor Haddon and his friends'
researches among the population of the Arran Islands in Galway Bay. Such is

one side of the question which I have in my mind : the other side consists of

the fact that the Celtic languages of to-day have been subjected to some dis-
turbing influence which has made their syntax unlike that of the other Aryan

languages. I have long been of opinion that the racial interpretation of that fact
 must be, that the Celts of our islands have assimilated another race using a

language of its own in which the syntactical peculiarities of Neo-Celtic had their

origin : in fact that some such race clothed its idioms in the vocabulary which
it acquired from the Celts. The problem then was to correlate those two facts.

 I am happy to say this has now been undertaken from the language point of view
by Professor J. Morris Jones, of the University College of North Wales. The
results have been made public in a book on The Welsh People recently published
by Mr. Fisher Unwin. The paper is entitled 'Pre-Celtic Syntax in Insular Celtic,'

 and the languages which have therein been compared with Celtic are old Egyptian

and certain dialects of Berber. It is all so recent that we have as yet had no

 criticism, but the reasoning is so sound and the arguments are of so cumulative a
 nature, that I see no reason to anticipate that the professor's conclusions are in any

 danger of being overthrown.

      At the close of his linguistic argument, Professor Morris Jones quotes a French
authority to the effect, that, when a Berber king dies or is deposed, which seems to
 happen often enough, it is not his son that is called to succeed him, but the
 son of his sister, as appears to have been usual among certain ancient peoples of

this country ; but of this more anon. In the next place my attention has been

 called by Professor Sayce to the fact that ancient Egyptian monuments represent
 the Libyans of North Africa with their bodies tattooed, and that even now some

 of the Touaregs and Kabyles do the same. These indications help one to group
                                                                               --

tlie ancient peoples of tbe British Isles to -whose influence we are to ascribe the

hou-Aryan features of Xeo-Celtic. In the first place one cannot avoid fixing on the

Plots, who were so called because of their habit of tattooing themselves. For as

to that fact there seems to be no room for doubt, and Mr. Nicholson justly lays
stress on the testimony of the Greek historian Herodian, who lived in the time of
Severus, and wrote about the latter's expedition against the natives of North

Britain a long time before the term Picti appears in literature. For Herodian,

after saying that they went naked, writes about them to the following

effect : ' They puncture their bodies with coloured designs and the figures of ani-

mals of all kinds, and it is for this reason that tbey do not wear clothes, lest one

should not behold the designs on their bodies.' This is borne out by the names by
which the Picts have been known to the Celts. That of Fict is itself in point,

and I shall have something to say of it presently ; but one of the other names was
in Irish Cruithni, and in Welsh we have its etymological equivalent in Prydyn or

Prydain. These vocables are derived respectively from Irish a-utJi and Welsh

l^ryd, both meaning shape, form, or figure, and it is an old surmise that the Picts
were called by those names in allusion to the animal forms pricked on their bodies,

as described by Herodian and others. The earlier attested of these two names

may be said to be Prydyn or Prydain, which the Welsh used to give in the Middle

Ages to the Picts and the Pictland of the North, while the term Ynys Prydain was

retained for Great Britain as a whole, the literal meaning being the Island of the

Picts : that is the only name which we have in Welsh to this day for this island

in which we live Ynys Prydain, ' The Picts' Island.' Now one detects this word

Prydain in effect in the Greek npfrawKol N^aot given collectively to all the British

Isfes by ancient authors. It may be rendered the Pictish Islands, but a confusion

seems to have set in pretty early with the name of the Brittanni or Brittones of

South Britain: that is to say, Prftem'c, ' Pictish,' became ^/·j7f«?iHtf or British;

and this is, historically speaking, the only knowQ justification we have for includ-

ing Ireland in the comprehensive term ' The British Isles,' to which Irishmen are

sometimes found jocularly to object.

In the next place may be mentioned the Tuatha De Danann of Irish legend,

who cannot always be distinguished from the Picts, as pointed out by Mr.

MacRitchie. The tradition about them is, that, when they were overcome in war

by Mil and his Milesians, they gave up their life above ground and retired into

the hills like the fairies, a story of little more value than that ol' the extermination

of the Picts of Scotland. In both countries doubtless the more ancient race

survived to amalgamate with its conquerors. There was probably some amount

of amalgamation between the Tuatha Do Danann or the Picts and the Little

Moundsmen ; but it is neces.>ary not to confound them. The Tuatha shared

with the Little People a great reputation for magic ; but they differed from

them in not being dwarfs or of a swarthy complexion : they are usually represented

as fair. In the case of Mider, the fairy king, who comes in some respects near the

description of the heroes of the Tuatha D6 Danann, it is to be noticed that he was

a wizard, not a warrior.

    Guided by the kinship of the name of the Tuatha D^ Danann on the Irish side
of the sea and that of the Sons of Don on this side, I may mention that the

Mabinogion place the Sons of Don on the seaboard of North Wales, in what is
now Carnarvonshire: more precisely their country was the region extending from
the mountains to the sea, especially opposite Anglesey. In that district we have

at least three great prehistoric sites all on the coast. First comes the great

stronghold on the top of Penmaen                                                                    Mawr                                 then  we have the huge  mound of Dinas
                                                                                                                                      ;

Dinlle, eaten into at present by the sea south-west ol the western mouth of the

Menai Straits                                                                  and lastly there is  the  extensive                             fortification of  Tre'r Ceiri, over-
                                                                            ;

looking Dinlle from the heights of the Eifi. By its position Tre'r Ceiri belonged

to the Sons of Don, and by its name it seems to me to belong to the Picts, which

comes, I believe, to the same thing. Now the name Tre'r Ceiri means the town

of the Keiri, and the Welsh word ceiri is used in the district in the sense of
persons who are boastful and ostentatious, especially in the matter of personal

appearance and fine clothing. It is sometimes also confounded with cewri^
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION tt.  891

' giahts,' but In the name of Tre'r Ceiri it doubtless wafts down to us au echo of

tiie personal conceit of the ancient Picts with their skins tattooed with decorative

pictures ; and Welsh literature supplies a parallel to the name Yn?/S Prt/dain in
one which is found written Ynys y Cetirt, both of -which may be rendered equally
the Island of the Picts, but more literally perhaps some such rendering as ' the
Island of the Fine Men ' would more nearly hit the mark. Lastly, with the Song
of Don must probably be classed the other peoples of the Mabinogion, such as the
families of Llyr, and of Pwyll and Rhiannon.

     All these peoples of Britain and Ireland were warlike, and such, so far

as one can see, that the Celts, who arrived later, might with them form one mixed

people with a mixed language, such as Professor Morris Jones has been helping

to account for.

     Let us now see for a moment how what we read of the state of society implied

in the stories of the Mabinogion will fit into the hypothesis which I have roughly

sketched. In the first place 1 ought to explain that the four stories of the

Mabinogion were probably put together originally in the Goidelic of Wales, before

they assumed a Brythonic dress. Further, in the form in which we know them,
they have passed through the hands of a scribe or editor living in Norman
times, who does not always appear to have understood the text on which he
was operating. To make out, therefore, what the original Mabinogion meant,
one has every now and then to read, so to say, between the lines. Let us take
for example the Mabinogi called after Branwen, daughter of Llyr. She was

sister to Bran, king of Prydain, and to Manawyddan, his brother : she was given to

wife to an Irish king named Matholwch, by whom she had a son called Gwern.

In Ireland, however, she was, after a time disgraced, and served in somewhat
the same way as the heroine of the Gudrun Lay but in the course of the time

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

which she spent in a menial position, doing the baking for the Court and having a
box on the ear administered to her daily by the cook, she succeeded in rearing a
starling, which one day carried a letter from her to her brother Bran at Harlech.

When the latter realised his sister's position of disgrace, he headed an expedition

to Ireland, whereupon Matholwch tried to appease him by making a concession,

which was, that he should deliver his kingdom to the boy Gwern. Now the

question is, wherein did the concession consist P The redactor of the Mabinogi
could, seemingly, not have answered, and he has not made it the easier for any one
else to answer. In the first place, instead of calling Gwern son of Matholwch, he
should have called him Gwern son of Branwen, after his mother, for the key to
the sense is, that, in a society which reckoned birth alone, Gwern was not recog-
nised as any relation to Matholwch at all, whereas, being Bran's sister's son, he

was Bran's rightful heir. No such idea, however, was present to the mind of a

twelfth-century scribe, nor could it be expected.

    Let us now turn to Irish literature, to wit, to one of the many stories
associated with the hero Ciichulainn. He belonged to Ulster, and whatever other
race may have been in that part of Ireland, there were Picts there : as a matter of
fact Pictish communities survived there in historical times. Now Cuchulainn

was not wholly of the same race as the Ultonians around him, for he and his
father are sharply marked ofi from all the other Ultonians as being free from the
periodical illness connected with what has been called the couvade, to which the

other adult braves of Ulster succumbed for a time every year. Then I may
mention that Ciichulainn's baby name was Setanta Beg, or the Little Setantian,

which points to the country whence Ciichulainn's father had probably come,
namely the district where Ptolemy mentions a harbour of the Setantii, somewhere
near the mouth of the Kibble, in what is now Lancashire. At the time alluded to
in the story I have in view, Ciichulainn was young and single, but he was even
then a great warrior, and the ladies of Ulster readily fell in love with him ; so
one day the nobles of that country met to consider what was to be done, and they
agreed that Cuchulainn would cause them less anxiety if they could find him a

woman who should be his fitting and special consort. At the same time also that

they feared he might die young, they were desirous that he should leave an heir, ' for,'

as it is put in the story, ' they knew that it was from himself his rebirth would be.'
892 REPORT 1900.

The Ulster men liad a tellef, you see, in the return of the heroes of previous
generations to be born again ; but we have here also two social systems face to face.
Accordino; to the one to which Ciichulainn as a Celt belonged, it was requisite

that he should be the father of recognised oiFspring, for it was only in the person
of one of them or of their descendants that he was to be expected back. The
story reads as if the distinction was exceptional, and as if the prevailing state of
things was wives more or less in common, with descent reckoned according to birth

alone. Such is my impression of the picture of the society forming the background

to the state of things implied by the conversation attributed to the noblemen of
Ulster. Here again one experiences difficulties arising from the fact, that the

stories have been built up in the form in which we know them by men who

worked from the Christian point of view ; and it is only by scrutinising, as it were,
the chinks and cracks that you can faintly realise what the original structure

was like.

    Among other aids to that end one must reckon the instances of men being

designated with the help of the mother's name, not the father's : witness that of
the king of Ulster iu Ciichulainn'stime, namely Conchobar mac Nessa, that is to
say, Conor, son of a mother named Nessa ; similarly in Wales with Gwydion son

of Don. Further we have the help of a considerable number of ancient inscrip-

tions, roughly guessed to date from the fifth or the sixth century of our era, and

commemorating persons traced back to a family group of the kind, perhaps,
which Cffisar mentions in the fourteenth chapter of his fifth book. Within these
groups the wives were, according to him, in common (inter se communes). Take
for instance an inscription from the barony of Corcaguiny in Kerry, which com-

memorates a man described as ' Mac Erce, son of Muco Doviimas,' where Muco

JDovvinias means the clan or family group of Dovvims or Dubin (genitive Duibne),

the ancestress after whom Corcaguiny is called Corco-Duibne in Medieval Irish.
We have the same formula in the rest of Ireland, including Ulster, where as yet very

few Ogams have been found at all. It occurs in South Wales and in Devonshire,
and also on the Ogam stone found at Silchester in Hampshire. The same kind
of family group is evidenced also by .in inscription at St. Ninian's,in Galloway; and,

-- --to go further back perhaps a good deal further back we come to the bronze

 discovered not long ago at Colchester, and dating from the time of the Emperor
Alexander Severus, who reigned from 222 to 235. This is a votive tablet to a
god Mars Medocius, by a Caledonian Pict, who gives his name as Loseio Veda,

and describes himself further as Nepos Vepogeni Caledo, He alludes to no father,
and Nepos Vepogeni is probably to be rendered Vepogen's sister's son. At any

 rate, the Irish word corresponding etymologically to the Latin nepos has that
 sense in Irish ; and, so far as I know, it has never Ijeen found meaning a nephew in
the sense of brother's son. That may serve as an instance how the ideas of
 another race penetrated the fabric of Goidelic society ; for here we must suppose
 a time to have come when there was no longer any occasion for a word meaning a
 brother's son, which, of course, there never was in the non-Celtic society which
 ranked men and women according to their birth alone.

     Now this Caledonian Pict was not exceptional among his kinsmen, for they suc-

 ceeded in observing a good deal of silence concerning their fathers down, one may
 say, to the 12th century. It is historical that the king of the northern Picts was
 not wont to be the son of the previous king. In short, when the Celtic elements

 there proved strong enough to ensure that the son of a previous king should

 succeed, a split usually took place, the purer Picts being led by the rule of succession

 by birth to set up a king of their own. The fact is not so well known that the
 same succession prevailed also some time or other at Tara in Ireland ; it is proved
 by a singular piece of indirect evidence, the existence of a tragic story to explain why
 ' no son should ever take the lordship of Tara after his father, unless some one
 came between them.' The last clause is due, I should say, to somebody who

 could not understand such a prohibition based on the ancient rule that a man's
 heir was his sister's son. This would be, according to Irish legend, in the lifetime

 of Conor mac Nessa.
      It is curious to notice hew the stories about the Pictish minage seem to have
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                    893

puzzled ancient authors. I will cite only one instance, to wit, from Golding's 16th

century translation of what then passed as the production of Solinus, and what

may pass now, even according to Mommsen, as quite old enough for my present

purpose. It runs thus : ' Next come the lies called Hebudes, live in number, the
inhabiters whereof know not what corne meaneth, but liue onely by lishe and

milke. They are all vnder the gouernment of one King. For as manie of them

as bee, they are seuered but with a narrowe groope one from another. The King

hath nothing of hys own, but taketh of euery mans. He is bounde to equitie by
certaine lawes : and least he may start from right through couetousnesse, he
learneth Justice by pouertie, as who may have nothing proper or peculiar to

himselfe, but is found at the charges of the Realme. Hee is not sufiered to
haue anie woman to himselfe, but whomsoeuev he hath minde vnto, he borroweth

her for a tyme, and so others by turnes. "VVherby it commeth to passe that he

hath neither desire nor hope of issue.'

The man who wrote in that way presumably failed to see that the king was

not subject to any special hardship as compared with the other men in his kingdom,

where none of them had any offspring that he could individually call his own.

This, be it noticed, refers to the Hebrides, not, as sometimes happens with such

references, to the more distant island of Thule, where there was also a king, as any

reader of Faust will tell us.

   We now come to the Celts, and begin with Pliny's version of Caesar's words

about the division of Gaul into three parts, as follows : Gallia oimiis Comata una

nomine appellata in tria populornm genera dividitur, amnibus maxims distijicta.

A Scalde ad Sequanam Belf/ica, ab eo ad Garunnam Celtica eademque Lugdunensis,

Weinde ad Pyrencei montis excursum Aquitanica, Aremorica antea dicta.  may

for the present dismiss the third or Aquitanic Gaul from our minds ; but Belgic

and Celtican Gaul may be taken as representing the two sets of Celts of our own

islands. The Belgic Gauls began last to come to this country, and their advent

seems to fall between the visits of Pytheas and Julius Cctsar: that is, roughly

speaking, between the middle of the fourth century and that of the first
century B.C. In this country they came to be known collectively as Brittanni or

Brittones, the linguistic ancestors of the peoples who have spoken Brythonic or the

Lingua Brittannica, such as the Welsh, the Cornish, and the Strathclyde Britons.

--As to the other Celts, it is much harder to say when or whence exactly they

came I mean the linguistic ancestors of the Gaels of Ireland, Man, and Scotland,

that is to say, the peoples whose language has been Goidelic. Some scholars are

of opinion that there were no Goidelic-speaking peoples in Britain till some such

came here from Ireland on sundry occasions, beginning with the second century, in
the time of the Roman occupation ; but how the Goidels would be supposed by

them to have reached Ireland I do not exactly know. My own notion is that the

bulk of them reached that country by way of Britain, and that they arrived in

Britain, like the Belgic Gauls later, from the nearest parts of the Continent; for

this would be previous to the appearance of the Belgic Gauls on the western sea-
board of Europe : that is to say, at a time when Celtica extended not merely to the

Seine, but to the Scheldt or to the Rhine, if not even further. Then as to the time

of the coming of the ancestors of the Goidels, it has been supposed coincident with

a period of great movements among the Celts of the Continent, in particular the

movements which resulted, among other things, in some of them reaching the

shores of the Mediterranean and penetrating to the heart of the Iberic peninsula.

Perhaps one would not be far wrong in fixing on the seventh and the sixth

centuries B.C. as covering the time of the coming of the earlier Celts to our

shores.

In Britain I should suppose these earlier hordes of Celts to have conquered

most of the southern half of the island ; and the Brythonic Celts, when they

arrived, miiy have overrun much the same area, pu$>hing the Go'delic ( elts more and

more towaids the west. Under that pressure it is natural to suppose that sume

of the latter made their way to Ireland, but it is quite possible that their

emigration thither had begun before. Some time or other previous to the Roman

occupation the Bi-ythonic people of the Ordovices seem to have penetrated to the
--894 REPORT 1900.

sea between the rivers Dovey and Mawddacb, displacing probably some Goidels
who may have gone to the opposite coasts of Ireland ; but in Irish story more
traces appear of invasions on the part of the Dumnonii, who possessed the coast
between Galloway and Argyle. These were so situated as to be able to assail
Ireland both in front and from behind, and this is countenanced to some extent by
Irish topograph}', not to mention the long legends extant as to great wars in the
west of Ireland between the Tuatha Dt5 Danann and invaders including the Fir
Domnann. I suspect also that it was the country of these northern Dumnonians
which was originally meant by Lochlinn, a name interpreted later to mean

Norway.
     Such are some of the faint traces of the Goidelic invasions of Ireland from

-- --Britain, but it is possible perhnps probable that Ireland received settlers on its

southern coast from the north-west of Gaul at a comparatively late period, at the
time, let us say, when Cseosar was engaged in crushing the Veneti and the

Aremoric League. This has been suggested to me by the name of the Usdite,

which probably survives in the first syllable of Ossory, denoting a tract of
country now, roughly speaking, covered by the county of Kilkenny, but which

may have been considerably larger before the Deisi took possession of the baronies
of the two Decies and other districts now constituting the county of Waterford,

not to mention possible encroachments on the part of Munster on a boundary

which seems to have been sometimes contested. Now the Continental name which

invites comparison with that of the Usdije is that of the Ostiiiei, who in the time
of Pytheas appear to have occupied the north-western end of what afterwards
came to be called Brittany ; they were also called Ostiones, and more commonly

Osismi. I see no reason to suppose that the ships of the Aremoric League could
not make the voyage from Brittany to the principal landing-places on the south of
Ireland from the Harbour of Cork to that of Waterford, and I gather from
Ptolemy's Geography that Ireland was relatively better known on the Continent
than Britain, although the latter had in a manner been long connected with the

--Poman world. This I should explain somewhat as follows : Csesar, who knew

very little about the west of Britain and less about Ireland, says that in
his time the great druidic centre of Gaul was in the country of the Carnutes,
somewhere, let us say, near the site of the present town of Chartres, that

druidism had been introduced from Britain to Gaul, and that those who wished
to understand it had to go to Britain to study. The authors of antiquity tell us

otherwise nothing about druids in Britain except that Tacitus speaks of such in
the Annals, in his well-known passage as to Suetonius Paulinus landing with his

troops in Anglesey and the scene of slaughter which ensued. Indeed, one may

go further and say that there is no proof that any Belgic or Brythonic people
ever had druids : they belonged to the Celtican Gauls and the Goidelicising Celts

of Britain and Ireland, who had probably accepted the institution from the
Pictish race. At any rate it is significant that the Life of St. Columba intro-

duces the reader to a genuine druid at the court of the Pictish king, near Inver-

ness, where, as well as on Loch Ness, the saint had to contend with him. In any
case, it is highly probable that druidism was no less a living institution in Ireland
than in the Goidelic and Pictish parts of Britain. Presumably it was more so,

and it may be conjectured that Gaulish students of druidism visited Ireland

no less than Britain ; also, vice versa, that Irish druids paid visits to the
Celtican part of Gaul where druidism flourished on the Continent, and in
a word that there was regular intercourse between Gaul and the south of

Ireland. If the druids of Ireland, who, among otlier roles, played that of
schoolmasters and teachers in that country, travelled to Celtica, they must
have spread on the Continent some information about their native country,
while generations of them cannot have returned to Ireland, with their druidic
pupils, without bringing with them some of the arts of civilised life as understood
in Gaul : among these one must rank very decidedly the art of writing, which the

druids practised. Now you know the usual account given of the ordinary Latin

--for Ireland, namely Hibernia to wit, that it was suggested by such native names

as that of one of the greatest tribes of that country, namely the 'lovepvoi
                                                                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  895

or Iverni, and that it had its v ousted when Latin began about the 4th

century to write b for v, and that an h was then prefixed to make the

word Hiberm'a properly connote the wintry climate which our sister island had
always been supposed to enjoy. But now comes the question, where did Pom-

ponius Mela, who flourished about the middle of the first century, get his

luverna, which Juvenal also used? Doubtless from a driiid like Daldn, or

some other educated native of Ireland; for what the editors print as luverna,

luuerna, or Juverna, would appear in ancient manuscripts as ivverna or

iuuerna, in which the first two syllables are spelt correctly with v v according to

a system of spellino- well known in Ogmic writing centuries later. But a parti-

cular system of spelling seems to me to imply writing-, and thus one is encouraged
to think that the Ogam alphabet may have been invented no later than the first

century, in the intercourse I have conjectured to have been going on between

the north-west of Gaul and the south of Ireland, where the majority of Oo-am

inscriptions are now found. But what has archaeology to say on the question

of such intercourse ?

After this digression I come back to the two main streams of Celtic iiumi"-ra-

tion, from the same parts of the Continent in two different periods of time. The

later of these introduced the Lingua Brittannica, which was practically a dialect

of old  Gaulish                                         but  the  affinities of the other Celtic language of these islands,
                                                     ;

the Goidelic, are not so easy to determine. I have long thought that I can

identify traces of it on the Continent, and that its principal home was in the

region which Pliny called Celtica, between the Garonne and the Seine. I ven-

tured accordingly to call it Celticnn, as the simpler word Cc4tic had already been

wedded to a wider signification. Since I did so the existence of that language has

been placed beyond doubt by the discovery of fragments of a calendar engraved

on bronze tablets. This find was made about the end of 1897 at a place called

Coligny, in the department of the Ain, and the pieces are now in the museum at

Lyons. It is difficult to say for certain whether Coiigny is within the territory

once occupied by the Sequani, or else by the Ambarri, a people subject to the

^Edui, who were the rivals of the Sequani and Arverni. The name of the Sequani

would seem to have belonged to the Cekican language, and Mr. Nicholson, in his

interpretation of the calendar, has ventured in this instance to call it Sequanian.

But two inscriptions in what appears to be the same language have come to light

also at a place called Rom, in the Deux Sevres and on the Roman road from

Poitiers to Saintes. This Celtican language is to be carefully distinguished

fi'om Gaulish, but it is not exactly what I expected it to be : it is better. For

several of the phonetic changes characteristic of Goidelic had not taken place in

Celtican. Among other things it preserves intact the Aryan consonant jh which

has since mostly disappeared in Goidelic, as it had even then in Gaulish. This

greater conservatism of Celtican enables one to refer to it the national appellation

of the_ people of the region in question, namely that of the Pictones, from

which it is impossible to sever the name of the Picts of Britain and Ireland,
who are found also called Pictones and Pictanei. Here I may mention that

Mr. Nicholson calls attention to instances of tattooing on some of the faces

on ancient coins belonging to Poitou and other parts of western France.

In the light of the names here in question one sees that ^jjcfos was a Celtican

word of the same etymology, and approximately, doubtless, of the same meaning, as

the Latin word jiictus, that the Celticans had applied it at an early date to the

Picts on account of their habit of tattooing themselves, and that the Picts had

accepted it (with its derivative Pictones) so generally that by the time when the

Norsemen arrived in the North of Scotland, it was the name which the natives

gave them as that by which they called themselves. That is practically proved

by the Norsemen calling Caithness and Sutherland Petta-land or the Land of the

Picts, and the sea washing its northern shore PettalandsJiorth, which survives

modified into Pentland Firth.

Another Celtican word of great interest here has by a mere chance come down

in a High German manuscript written before the year 814 : it is Ckortonicum,

and it occurs among a number of geographical names, several oi -which refer to Gaul,
                              --:

so that Ghortonicuin may very well have meant the country of the Pictones. At
all events, the great German philologist Pott at once saw that it was to be ex-
plained by reference to the word Cruithne, ' a Pict,' with which it decidedly goes

as distinguished from its Brythonic equivalent Prydrjn (or the older Priten)
with an initial ;;. The Celtican form originally meant was some such vocable as
Qurtonico-n, with the qu which was usual in Celtican and early Goidelic, where it
formed, in fact, one of the most conspicuous distinctions between those languages
and Brythonic or Gaulish, in which qu had been changed into^.

    My remarks have again run into tiresome details, but it is only by attending to

such small points that one can hope to force language to yield us any information

in the matter of ethnology. It may perhaps help in some measure if I sum up

what I have been trying to say, thus

    The first race we have found in possession of the British Isles consisted of a
small swarthy population of mound-dwellers, of an unwarlike disposition, much

given to magic and wizardry, and living underground : its attributes have been
exaggerated or otherwise distorted in the evolution of the Little People of our

fairy tales.

     The next race consisted of a blue-eyed people, taller and blonder, who tattooed
themselves and fought battles. These tattooed or Pictish people made the Mound
Folk their slaves, and in the long run their language may be supposed to have
been modified by habits of speech introduced by those slaves of theirs from
their own idiom. The affinities of these Picts may be called Libyan, and possibly

Iberian.

    Next came the Celts in two great waves of immigration, the first of which may

have arrived as early as the 7th century before our era, and consisted of the
real ancestors of some of our Goidels of the Milesian stock, and the linguistic

ancestors of all the peoples who have spoken Goidelic. That language may be

defined as Celtican so modified by the idioms of the population, which the earlier
Celts found in possession, that its syntax is no longer Aryan.

     Then, about the third century B.C., came from Belgica the linguistic ancestors
of the peoples who have spoken Brythonic ; but most of our modern Brythons
are to be regarded as descended from Goidels who adopted Brythonic speech, and
in so doing brought into that language their Goidelic idioms, with the result
that the syntax of insular Brythonic is no less non-Aryan than that of Goidelic,

as may be readily seen by comparing the thoroughly Aryan structure of the few

sentences of old Gaulish extant.

     Those are the races which have been inferred in the course of these remarks,
in which I have proceeded on the principle that each successive band of conquerors
has its race, language, and institutions eventually more or less modified by contact

with the race, language, and institutions of those whom it has conquered. That
looks simple enough when stated so, but the result which we get proves com-

plicate. At all events I have endeavoured to substitute for the rabble of divinities

and demons, of fairies and phantoms that disport themselves at large in Celtic
legend, a possible succession of peoples, to each of which should be ascribed its

own proper attributes. But that will only be possible if we can enlist the kindly
aid of the Muse of Archaeology.

5. Writing in Prehistoric Greece. By ARTHUR J. EvANS, M.A., F.S.A

(1) Clay Documents with Hieroglyphic or Conventionalised Pictographic
                         Script from the Palace of Knossos.

     The discovery originally announced by the author in 1894, in this Section * of

the existence in prehistoric Crete of a system of conventionalised pictographic or
hieroglyphic writing had received an extraordinary corroboration and supplement

from his recent excavations in the Mycenaean Palace of Knossos. The first indica-
tions had been supplied by groups of signs engraved on early seal-stones, and by its
nature the evidence was limited. But in the great prehistoric building now par-

tially explored at Knossos, the latest elements of which can hardly be brought

down later than the thirteenth century B.C., there came to light a series of

deposits of clay archives inscribed both with hieroglyphic and a new system of

linear writing.

      Those of the hieroglyphic class, though apparently contemporary with the
other, were less numerous and were found in a separate magazine. They were in
the form of square and three-sided bars, perforated at the end, clay 'labels ' also

perforated, in shape like bivalve shells, and sealings of clay which also presented

impressions of signets with characters of the same conventionalised pictographic
class. The graffito characters of the clay bars, &c., gave more linearised versions
of the fuller representations of the engraved seals, and thus illustrated a step in the

formation of letters. The tablets showed various new forms of hieroglyphs not as
yet found on the signets, raising the Cretan series to over a hundred. The picto-

graphic signs might be said to form an illustrated history of Cretan culture in

Mycensean times. Among new characters might be mentioned an eight-stringed

lyre, carpenter's tools such as a kind of plane and perhaps a level, dogs' heads

bees, a glove-like object perhaps not unconnected witli bee-keeping, and appa-

rently olive sprays. The obviously ' ideographic ' or ' determinative ' character of
some of the hieroglyphs gives a clue to the meaning of many of the tablets. Ships,

Aploughs and ox-heads, vessels filled with grain, and the Egyptian palace sign
speak for themselves.  boustrophedon arrangement of the characters is often

traceable. Many of these clay records are accounts, as is shown by the presence

of various numeral signs, the ciphers never exceeding eight in a group. But the

form of numeration still presents points of obscurity.

     The hieroglyphic script itself shows a certain parallelism with the'Hittite'

inscriptions of Anatolia and Northern Syria. Its beginnings can, however, be
traced very far back on Cretan soil, and it unquestionably represents the writing
of the indigenous Cretan stock, the Eteocretans of the ' Odyssey.'

(2) Clay Documents inscribed with Linear Scrijit from the Palace of Knossoi,

The, great bulk of the clay records discovered in the Palace of Knossos exhibited

a linear style of writing fundamentally different from that of the hieroglyphic class,
and far ahead of it in development. The tablets are for the most part elongated slips

of hand-moulded clay, from two to about seven inches in length, and from half an

inch to three inches broad ; others, however, are of a squarer form. They present

some distant analogy to the Babylonian tablets, and the inscription is divided by

horizontal lines. The letters themselves, however, are of a free, upright European

character. Some seventy characters seem to have been in common use, and of them

about ten show resemblances to the later Greek and the same number to the
Cypriote syllabary. About the same number of forms are also common to the

hieroglyphic Cretan aeries. The letters seem to have been for the most part

syllabic ; lines of division appear between the words, and the writing runs consist-

ently from left to right. The pictorial origin of these letters may be traced in

some cases. Thus, we have the human head and neck, the hand, the crossed arms,

a bird flying, three or four barred gates, a fence, a high-backed throne, a tree,
Aand a leaf.
              certain number are unquestionably ideographic or determinative.

Others represent measures and quantities, and are always associated with numerals.

A good many of these documents evidently refer to Palace accounts, and a clue

to the general purport of the tablet is often supplied by the introduction of a

Wepictorial figure.  thus find chariots and horses, human figures, perhaps slaves,

axes, ingots, vases of precious metals, others of clay for various liquids, houses or

barns, swine, ears of corn, various kinds of trees and a crocus-like flower, perhaps

used for a dye or perfume.

   A decimal system of numeration was employed, somewhat resembling the

Egyptian. The value theoretically arrived at by the author for the numerals was

proved by an addition sum presented by one tablet, the total of which worked out

correctly.

     The ingots depicted on the tablets resembled a Mycenfean copper ingot from
Cyprus and others from Sardinia. They were followed by a balance (the Greek
talantori) and numerals apparently indicating their value in Mycenaean gold talents.
It has thus been possible to make an approximate calculation of their weight.
Objects in precious metals represented were identical with some typical tributary
ofi"ering8 of the Keft chieftains on the Theban monuments of Thothmes III.'s time,
and tended to show that some of these clay documents went back to the first half of

the fifteenth century B.C.

      Other tablets, without ciphers or pictorial figures, perhaps refer to contracts or

correspondence, such as the contemporary records of Syria and Babylonia. The
tablets had been originally contained in coffers of wood, clay, and gypsum, and
these in turn secured by clay seals bearing impressions of Mycenaean engraved gems
of the finest style. These impressions had in many cases been countermarked
with a graffito sign by the controlling official while the clay was still wet, and the
back of the clay seal was at the same time endorsed and countersigned with short
inscriptions in the same script as that of the tablets. Such legal precautions were

quite worthy of the 'Palace of Minos.'
     These discoveries not only carry back the existence of written documents on

Greek soil some seven centuries before the first known monuments of Greek writing,
and five before the earliest Phoenician, but they afford a wholly new standpoint

for investigating the origin of the alphabet.

     The letter-forms borrowed by the Greeks from the Phoenicians seem to have
been influenced by these pre-existing yEgean scripts. The common elements existing
in the Phoenician alphabet itself are very noteworthy. Out of twenty-two original

letters, some twelve present obvious points of comparison with characters belonging

to one or other of the two Cretan scripts, and to these at least four may be

added as showing possible affinities. In view of such parallelism, which extends
to the meaning as well as the form of the signs, De Rough's theory of the
derivation of the Phoenician letters from remote hieratic Egyptian prototypes must
be definitely abandoned. The Phoenician, and with it the Greek, alphabet must
Transactions of section h.                                        899

fee regarded as a selection from a syllabary belonging to the same generic group as
the Cretan. Such a phenomenon on the Syrian coast is perhaps explained by the
settlement there in Mycenaean times of an /Egean island race, the Philistines,
whose name survives in that of Palestine. Though later SemitiseH, rheir biblical

names of Kaphtorim and Kerethim, or Cretans, sufficiently record their ^gean

origin.

  6. On the System of Writing in Ancient Egypt, By F. Ll. Griffith,

   Egyptology has now reached a position among the sciences from which it may

contribute trustworthy information for the benefit of kindred researches. Eg-yptian

--writing consists of Ideographic and Phonetic Elements, the signs serving as
   1, AVord-signs ; 2, Phonograms ; 3, Determinatives. The highest development
shown is an alphabet, which, however, is never used independently of other signs :
it is apparently not acrophonic in origin; it represents consonants and semi-

consonants only, vocalisation not being recorded by Egyptian writing. No

advance ca,n be detected in the system from the beginning of the historic period to
the end, notwithstanding some improvements in practical working which facilitated
the US3 of cursive writing. Phonograms derived from word-signs. The end of

--the native system was brought about by the gradual adoption of the Greek character
   beginning, perhaps, in the second century a.d. If any radical improvement was
ever made in the Egyptian form of writing that improvement must have taken
place at or after adoption by another people : e.g., some have supposed that our
alphabet was derived by the Phoenicians from Egypt ; but any such derivations

are at present entirely hypothetical.

     Although the Egyptian system of writing may not be actually a stage in the

history of our alphabet, it throws a strong light on the development of the
alphabetic system ; and the survival of its pictorial form (for decorative purposes)
enables us to recognise the highly ramified connections between the forms and
meanings of characters to an extent which is impossible at present in any other
system, whether in Mesopotamia, China, or elsewhere.

     Results of recent Egyptian philology : Egyptian originally a Semitic language,

though its character changed early. The main lines of the grammar being at
length establi.'ihed, the materials for a complete dictionary are now being collected
and classified.

Aversion Is preserved by Ilesiod.  thorougli exploration of it, Undertaken in May

and June of the current year, by Mr. D. G. Hogarth, on behalf of the British

School at Athens, aided by the Cretan Exploration Fund, has served fully to con-

nrm this view. The cave is double. On the north is a shallow grotto, the upper

part of which was cumbered with immense fallen fragments of the roof. The

lower part contained deep black earth, partly ransacked by previous diggers. This

was thoroughly dug out this year, and when the great blocks had been broken up

with blasting powder and removed, the deposit on the higher slope was also

searched. The result was the discovery of a rude altar in the middle of the grotto,

surrounded by strata of ashes, pottery, and other refuse, among which many

votive objects in bronze, terra-cotta, iron, and bone were found, together with
fragments of some thirty libation tables in stone, and an immense number of
earthenware cups used for depositing oiferings. The lowest part of the Upper

Grotto was found to be enclosed by a wall partly of rude Cyclopean character,
and partly rock-cut ; and within this Temenos the untouched strata of deposit
ranged from the early Mycenaean Age up to the Geometric period of the ninth cen-
tury B.C. or thereabout. Only very slight traces were found of later offerings. The
earliest votive stratum belongs to the latest period of the pre-Mycenjean Age,
that marked by the transition between the ' Kamaraes ' fabric of pottery and the
earliest Mycenaean lustre- painted ware. But below all is a thick bed of yellow
clay, containing scraps of primitive hand- burnished black and brown pottery,

mixed with bones of animals. This bed seems to be water-laid, and to be prior to
the use of the cave as a sanctuary. Probably, when it was in process of formation,
the cave was still a swallow-hole of the lake which once occupied the closed Lasithi
basin · but before the Mycenaean period the present outlet had opened, and the

plain was dry.
    The southern or Lower Grotto falls steeply for some 200 feet to a subterranean

pool, out of which rises a forest of stalactite pillars. Traces of a rock-cut stairway

remain. Much earth had been thrown down by the diggers of the Upper Grotto,
and this was found full of small bronze objects. But chance revealed a more

fruitful field, namely, the vertical cbinks in "the lowest stalactite pillars, a great

many of which were found still to contain toy double axes, knife-blades, needles,
and other objects in bronze, placed there by dedicators, as in niches. The mud
also at the edge of the subterranean pool was rich in similar things, and in statu-
ettes of two types, male and female, and engraved gems. These had probably

been washed out of the niches.
    The knife-blades and simulacra of weapons are probably the offerings of men

the needles and depilatory tweezers of women. The frequent occurrence of the

double axe, not only in bronze, but moulded or painted on pottery, found in the

cave, leaves no doubt that its patron god was the ' ( Jarian ' Zeus of Lahranda, or

the Labyrinth, with whom perhaps his mother, the Nature jroddess, was associated,

and the statuettes probably represent the two deities. Here was the primitive
scene of their legend, transferred in classical times to a cave on Mount Ida.

     2. On the Japanese GoJiei arid the Ainu Inao. By W. G. AsTON.

     The paper illustrates a principle in the history of religion by which the object
which is at tirst simply an offering has a tendency to become conceived of as the
embodiment of the God, or even as a distinct and independent deity.

     In ancient Japan the offerings to the gods were of the most varied description.

Among them were included hemp and bark fibre, together with cloth made from

these materials. In later times there was substituted a small quantity of paper

made of the same bark fibre and attached to a wand in the form known to us as
gohei. With the change of form the original character of the ,170/;^} as offerings
was forgotten. They were looked upon as receptacles or embodiments of the God,
and honour was paid to them accordingly. At festivals the God descended into
the gohei on a certain formula being pronounced by the priest. Hypnotic prac-
titioners also used tliese objects in their stances, the deity who inspired them in
                                                                        TRAXSACTIO^rS OF SECTION HI  901

their trances being supposed to enter their body by this channel. There are cases
in Japan in which the devotee has gone a step further, and has constituted the
object, which was originally an offering, a distinct and independent deity.

     The Ainus of Yezo use in their worship whittled sticks called inao, which have a

general resemblance to an old form of the gohei, and are no doubt a cheaper substi-
tute for them. The inao, like the gohei, are primarily offerings, but in certain
cases they receive direct worship as gods, having become in short genuine fetishes.
Another link between the inao and the gohei is provided by certain whittled
sticks closely resembling inao which were in use in Northern Japan a century ago

for striking women with in order to ensure fertility, as in the Roman Lupercalia.

Similar sticks after consecration by the Shuite priests were formerly used at Kioto

to kindle the household fire afresh on the new year, and so avert possible pestilence.

3. The Textile Patterns of the Sea-Dayaks. By Dr. A. C. Haddon, i^.iZ./S'.

     The Sea-Day ak women weave short cotton rep petticoats and cotton sleeping

wraps which are covered with beautiful and often intricate patterns. The patterns

are made in the following manner : the warp is stretched on a frame, the woman

takes the first fifteen to thirty strands and ties them tightly with strips of leaves
at irregular intervals, according to the design, which she carries in her memory.
The next fifteen to thirty strands are similarly tied, and this process is repeated
until all the threads have been utilised. The warp is then removed from the frame
and dipped in a reddish dye, which colours the free portions of the warp, but the
tied-up portions remain undyed ; thus a light pattern is left on a coloured back-
ground, when the lashing is untied. If a three-colour design is required, as is

usually the case, the first lashing is retained, and various portions of the previously
dyed warp are tied up ; the whole is immersed in a black dye, and then both sets of
lashing are untied. The pattern is thus entirely produced in the warp, the woof is
self-coloured, and does not obtrude itself in the material.

     There are a very large number of designs and patterns, which are remembered

by the women and handed down from mother to daughter. By far the greater

number of these designs are based upon animals, v/hereas most of the patterns
carved by the men on wooden and bamboo objects are derived from plant motives.
The designs embroidered by the women on jackets and loin-cloths are usually
zoomorphic in character, but the treatment of the motives is quite different from

the decoration of previously described fabrics.

     The decorative art of the Sea-Dayaks of Sarawak differs in character from that
of the Kayans, Kenyahs, and other inland tribes.

4. Relics of the Stone Age of Borneo. By Dr. A. C. Haddox, F.R.S.

Until about eighteen months ago the only authentic example known in this

country of a stone implement from Sarawak was the specimen collected by A. Hart

Everett, which is now in the Pitt Rivers Collection at Oxford. In December,

1898, the Sarawak Museum obtained a specimen of a different type. I discovered

a third type in a Sibop house on the Tinjar River in the Baram District of

Sarawak                                      later Dr. C. Hose, the Resident of the Baram District, obtained numerous
                                          ;

examples from various interior tribes in his district ; these he has generously

presented to the University of Cambridge. The occurrence of stone implements in

Borneo has been previously noted.

The implements are made of various rocks, including fibrolite, impure sand-

eyes a pacred character, and it is Tery difficult to persuade their owners to part
with them. In all cases fowls had to be sacrificed to appease the spirits. The
implements are stored with other sacred objects, and most of them are believed to

                          By A. C. Haddon, Sc.D., F.R.S.

     The author exhibited a series of nearly fifty lantern slides taken during his
recent expedition to Sarawak, which were selected to illustrate the type of house
that is common among the settled inland tribes of Borneo and the every-day life

of the people. No attempt was made to distinguish between the various tribes, as
their mode of life is very similar in its main features. The villages are all situated
on or close by the banks of rivers ; most of the houses are of large size, and may con-

tain from half-a-dozen to sixty families. Sometimes a village consists of a single
house or of a string of houses placed endwise to each other.

   A house is built on piles some ten to twenty feet from the ground. Along the

side facing the river is a wide verandah, which stretches down the whole length
of the house. Here many of the domestic industries are carried on, and all social
and public busine-s is transacted. The dwelling-rooms of each family open by a
single door on to the verandah. While the common verandah affords every facility
for social intercourse the privacy of the home is thoroughly respected.

      In the verandah of nearly every house is at least one trophy of the skulls of
enemies, which are supposed to bring good luck and plenteous harvests. Food is
occasionally ofi'ered to them, and a fire has to be kept burning beneath them, other-
wise the skulls would he uncomfortable and bring misfortunes to the house.
Various industries were illustrated by slides, such as the husking and winnowing

of rice by the women. The houses are often ornamented with carvings or

paintings of a conventional character, the style of decoration varying according
to the tribe.

                     By John Beddoe, M.D., LL.D., F.E.S.

      The author discussed the question whether any considerable British or pre-
Anglian element remained in the country around Bradford. Without coming to
 any positive conclusion, he was disposed to consider the inhabitants of these parts
 as mainly Anglian in type. More British blood remained further north, in Craven.

A prevalent type about Leeds seemed to him to resemble the Burgundian Belair

 type of His and Riitimeyer.

      The commiimcation isi based on a description of two heads, both dolichoid in
 pattern, but of which the one, which was most distinctly so, gave a latitudinal
 index (living) of 82-3, owing to retarded ossification of the posterior part of the

 w\temporo-parietal suture. But for this the author thought the iijdes would

 3. On certain Markings on the Frontal Fart of the Human Cranium^ and
                   their Significance. By A. Francis Dixon.

     An examination of the frontal region of tlie cranium shows that, in many cases,

grooves or channels are present on the bone, corresponding to the branches of the

supra-orbital nerves. These grooves vary very much in appearance, as thej- may

 be simple or branched, shallov? or deeply cut. They are not infrequently converted
in parts of their course into little tunnels. In some cases they are found on one
side of the cranium only, in others they occur or both sides ; their distribution is
very rarely quite symmetrical. Most frequently the grooves occur beneath
the outer branches of the supra-orbital nerve, but in many cases they are found

--beneath the inner branches. The grooves never pass from the frontal on to the

parietal bone across the coronal suture. They often extend upwards from the

 supra-orbital notch, or foramen, as far as the coronal suture; in other cases they
begin inferiorly at a little foramen where some branch of the nerve enters the bone.

The openings of these little foramina are directed upwards towards the coronal

suture, just as the openings of the nutrient foramina in the long bones are
directed towards the end of the bone where growth is most active and goes
on longest.

     The presence of these grooves indicates a want in proportion between the growth
in length of the nerves and the amount of expansion of the underlying part of the
cranium. The nerves might be looked upon as constricting cords which become
depressed in the developing bone as the cranium expands. The constricting

portions of the nerves are often limited inferiorly at a point where some little
branch enters the bone, and superiorly at the coronal suture, where the deep
layers of scalp are firmly bound down to the cranium. Hence the grooves for the
nerves do not cross the coronal suture and often begin inferiorly at little foramina
whose openings are directed upwards. The grooves appear to indicate in the
skulls in which they occur an excessive development of the frontal part of the

cranial wall. In races in whom the grooves are common, and strongly marked,
we would expect the presence of a tendency towards increased development and

capacity of the frontal part of the cranium ; while, on the other hand, in races

in whom the grooves do not occur, or are rare, and but feebly marked, we

would expect to find much uniformity in the shape and size of the cranium,

indicating that none of its various parts are tending towards an increased develop-
ment. In the purer races of mankind, with marked uniformity in the size and

shape of their crania, we would look for the greatest harmony between the growth
in length of the overlying structures and the amount of expansion of the
various parts of the cranial wall ; on the other hand, in mixed races we would be
more likely to find individuals exhibiting a want of such correspondence in the
amount of growth of the superficial and deeper structures. In this connection it

is interesting to note that the frontal grooves are almost never found in Australian,

and Tasmanian skulls, that they are rare among Melanesians, slightly more common
among Polynesians, while among Bushmen and Negroes, especially in Zulus and
Kaffirs, they are very common, and often extraordinarily well marked. Among

Negroes they are present in over 50 per cent, of the skulls examined. In the
skulls obtained in the dissecting room they are present in about 41 per cent,

of all cases.

4. On the Sacral Index. By Professor D. J. Cunningham, M.D., F.R.S.

     Inasmuch as the true length of the sacral portion of the vertebral column is
not indicated by the shortest distance between the apex and base of the sacrum,
but rather by the length of the curve formed by the sacral vertebrae, it is proposed
that, in making measurements for the determination of a sacral index, * length '
should be measured by using a tape along the concavity of the sacral curve, and
not by calipers, one limb of which is placed upon the base and the other on the
g,pex of the pacfuni. Breadth (measured by calipers in th§ oydjn^rj piftpner)

--904 REPORT 1900.

multiplied by 100 and divided by length, measured in tbe manner indicated, gives

the true sacral index.

    The curvature of the sacrum may be conveniently plotted by taking a tracing

from a strip of soft metal which has been previously adapted by pressure to the

front of the sacrum along its middle line. The index of curvature may be ex-

pressed by tbe number derived by multiplying tbe height of this plotted curve
by 100 and dividing by the number corresponding to the true length of the

sacrum.

                            .5. On the Microceplialic Brain.
                By Professor D. J. Cunningham, M.D., F.R.S.

    The brain of the microcephalic idiot may exhibit features which do not merely

represent a 'fixed' embryonic condition. In one specimen the arrangement of

the fissures and sulci is found to approach more closely the ape than the human

type, and in almost every furrow some simian character can be detected. These
simian characters must not be considered mere foetal conditions rendered per-
manent. The ape-like condition existing in this brain does not as a whole
correspond to that of any one ape, or group of apes, but there is a complicated
mixture of features some of which are characteristic of high apes, while others

find a parallel in the brain of low apes. The microcephalic brain maybe regarded

as a partial ' atavism.' So far as its surface markings are concerned the specimen
noted has reverted in part, or wholly, to an arrangement which, in all probability,
existed in some early stem -form of man.

6. DeveloiJmental Changes in the Human Skeleton from the Point of View
         of Anthropology. By David Waterston, M.D., F.R.C.S.E.

    A series of specimens of the long bones of the extremities at different ages of

embryonic and infantile life has been collected and examined. The methods
employed in the examination were those of anthropometry, namely, osteometry
and osteoscopy.

     By the former, the relative lengths of the bones of the limbs at different ages

 have been ascertained and compared one with another, and by the latter it has
 been found that these bones present some definite and interesting characters.
 Without going minutely into the rate of growth of each segment of the upper and
 lower limbs, the general character was shown, and the special features of the
 bones at different ages were demonstrated by means of lantern slides taken from

 photographs of the objects. An attempt has also been made to ascertain the

 cause of the special characters found in the bones by investigating the time of
 their appearance and of their replacement by adult characters.

    A comp.arison has also been instituted between the bones of the embryo and

 those of the lower races of mankind and of the higher apes, both as regards their
 relative length and their characters.

      As it has been shown that the curvature of the spine in the lumbar region is a

 post-natal development, and one adapted to the assumption of th.e erect attitude

  by the infant, it was shown that in a similar way the configuration of the bones

  of the lower extremity alters after birth, before the infant can stand erect.

    Sir Wm. Turner exhibited a plaster mould of a head, which had been modelled

by a Roman sculptor in probably the third century a.d., on which the prints

of the lines on the skin of the sculptor's fingers had been preserved. The mould
belonged to Mr. G. Allis, of the Eoman House, Lincoln, who had obtained it
during the excavation of the foundations of his house a few years ago, the site of

which is within the area of a large building of Roman times, several of the

columns of which are preserved in the basement of his house.

                      4. The Paganism of the Civilised Iroquois.

             By David Boyle, Curator of the Museum, Toronto.

     Notwithstanding the contact of tlie Iroquois, or Six Nation Indians, with
white people for more than three hundred years, a very considerable number of

the former have retained many of their old-time beliefs, with the forms and

ceremonies appertaining thereto.

     Of four thousand Caniengas (Mohawks), Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas,
Oneidas, and Tuscaroras now residing on the Grand Reserve, within sixty miles of

Toronto, Ontario, fully one-fourth continue to observe the ancient feasts or dances
connected with the growth and ingathering of corn and fruits, and for desired
changes in weather, as well as for the cure of disease.

     Some modification in the ceremonies was made about a century ago by an
Onondaga named Ska-ne-o-dy'-o, who announced himself as a prophet who had paid
a visit to the abode of the Great Spirit. The changes introduced by him, however,
have not by any means removed the pagan character of the native beliefs,
although he certainly did attempt to imitate some Christian observances.

     Still, the addresses of the medicine men retain most of the old-time forms,
although their significance in many cases is lost, and even the meaning of numerous
words is no longer known.

     The leading idea in the present form of worship is that of a Great Spirit, but
this has been acquired from missionary sources ; and although the Indians have
adopted the idea of a heaven, they do not believe in any hell.

     The quoted examples of petitions addressed to Rawen Niyoh (the Creator)
illustrate the lack of assimilation of the old and n6w forms.

     One of the most characteristic ceremonies connected with Iroquois paganism
is that of the sacrifice or burning of the White Dog at the new year feast during
the February moon, when the spirit of the dog, accompanied by offerings of
tobacco, conveys to Niyoh information respecting the condition of his 'own
people ' on the Grand River Reserve.

5. Notes on Malay Metal-ivork. By Walter Rosenhain, B.A., St. John's

      College, Cambridge ; 1851 Exhibition Commissioners' Research Scholar,

       University of Melbourne.

     The paper dealt with some specimens of Malay metal-work submitted to the

author for microscopic and other examination hj Mr. W. W. Skeat. Some

Malay processes actually witnessed by Mr. Skeat were described, and the bearings
 of the microscopic examination on the explanations of these processes are

 discussed.

      The first question dealt with is the production of the 'damask' pattern on a
Malay kris. Microphotographs were given showing that the ' damask iron ' really
consists of layers of loosely welded wrought iron, the only other metal used being
tool steel. The body of the blade is made of steel, and a layer of laminated
'damask iron' is welded upon either side of the central layer of steel; a thin
layer of steel is welded on outside the ' damask iron.' The author believes that
the striated ' damask ' effect is due to the opening of the loose welds in the damask
iron during the forging of the blade, steel being driven between the laminae. The
outside layer of steel is entirely ground away, and when the compound surface so
produced is ' etched ' by the pickling process employed, the more readily corroded
steel is attacked, leaving the edges of the layers of iron as a series of narrow

projecting ridges.

     The tools of the Malay goldsmith were next described, and the micro-structure
and composition of Malay bronzes and ' white metal ' were described and discussed.

     The final section of the paper dealt with the Malay method of producing chains
by casting.

   6. I^ote on the ^Kingfisher' Kriss. By Professor Henry Louis, M.A.

      This note describes a peculiar pattern of kriss used in a limited area in the

north-east of the Malay Peninsula. The Malay legend of its origin is that a
party of Malays from the Bugis islands invaded this portion of the peninsula
many centuries ago ; one of their leaders was known as ' the Kingfisher ' (pre-
sumably on account of his rapid movements). The invasion was successful, but

the leader fell in one of the last engagements. After his death his followers
carved their kriss handles into shapes resembling the kingfisher's head and beak.

Under Chinese influence the pattern became more ornate, until it reached the

present fixed type.

     The writer discovered in a pawnshop in Bangkok an earlier form of this type
(possibly the only one extant) : this kriss seems to have been sold by a Malay

from this region, many of whom are well known to have been deported by the

Siamese between the years 1790 and 1820. Colonies of their descendants still
exist in Siam, and have been visited by the writer. The early type of ' King-

fisher ' kriss is much more like the bird's head than the modern pattern, which is,
however, now the only one seen among or known to the Malays. The region in

question has rarely been visited by Europeans.

7. On some Buddhist Sites. By W. Laav Bros.

The author exhibited a photograph of the temple erected on the spot where

ABuddha ' meditated.'  sample of the sacred ' Bo ' tree was also shown. The

delicate carvings in these temples were exhibited and explained. What was

described as the ' Tope ' was a characteristic development in Buddhist sacred

buildings, and sometimes these were treated with elaborate ornamentation. In

addition to the sites a series of views showing the rock-caverns which enter so

largely into Buddhist religious life were exhibited. These rock-caves contain

specimens of the earliest Buddhist sculptures known. The author also showed

views of a number of Jain temples which were among the most richly elaborate in

ornamentation of all Indian sanctuaries, and also views of side-chapels and cloisters

belonging to these temples, in nearly all of which the cross-legged figure of the

Buddha was fquud.,

                                    By H. Ling Rotu.

     The author enumerated the various purposes for which these disfigurements
were made. They were connected among other things with beliefs in the future
life, it being supposed that without them one could not find his way about in the
next world. They also served as charms for women at childbirth. The institution
was really divisible into four divisions. The Tahitian method was the one

commonly seen on our sailors. The New Zealand method, which was performed

by a pricker, left behind a very deep mark in the skin, and was often performed so
freely as to cover the whole skin. The West African and the Tasmanian methods
differed from the preceding ones, and in the case of the last of these the marks
develop into large continuous scars. They were all variations of skin deformations,
but rubbed in, and they leave a permanent mark The author exhibited pictures
of the various specimens of; hese different methods of tattooing, and accompanied
them with pictures of the different instruments employed. The wounds made
were frequently reopened in order to put in colouring juices, and owing to this
they were a long time in healing, and left behind them permanent scars.

2. Some Peculiar Features of the Animal-cults of the Xatives of SarawaJc,
    and their Bearing on the Problems of Totemism. By Charles Hose,

    D.Sc, Resident of the Baram District, and W. McDougall, M.A.

   We bad observed customs that seemed to indicate the existence of a well-

developed totemism, either at the present time or in recent times, among the

natives of Sarawak. W^e have thereibre collected information bearing on this

subject as diligently as possible, from all the tribes with whom we have come into

intimate contact.

   We found a great number and variety of peculiar rites and customs observed

by the people of the different tribes in their dealings with animals and plants.

We confine ourselves in this short paper (1) to giving a general account of the

customs of one of the inland tribes, the Kenyahs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                {;2) to describing the ' Nyarong,'

or spirit-helper of the Sea-Dayaks, and some similar institutions among the other

tribes ; and (3) to pointing out the bearing of our observations on the totem

problem.

     The Kenyahs are a warlike agricultural people, living as isolated communi-
ties of twenty to fifty or more families, each community inhabiting a single long

house built on the river-bank. Their religion is peculiar, in that they believe in

a beneficent Supreme Being and a group of departmental deities, while they attri-
bute to every agent that affects their lives a spirit that must be properly respected

and, if necessary, propitiated.

    Most important to them of all the animals is the common white-headed hawk.

He brings messages of warning and advice from the Supreme Being to those who

know how to read the signs he gives, and he is consulted before every under-

Ataking of importance, and sacrifices of fowls and pigs are made to him.                                                                                                                                                                                                        wooden

image of the hawk stands before every house. Several other birds give them
omens of lesser importance, and none of these may be killed or eaten.

    The domestic fowl is killed as a sacrifice to the hawk or other powers, and its

blood is sprinkled on the altar-posts of the gods and on the persons taking part in

various ceremonies, especially peace-making ceremonies. The domestic pig is

sacrificed in much the same way. The spirit of a pig is always charged with some

prayer to be carried to the Supreme Being, and the answer is read from the

markings of its liver.

    ffje crocodiles are regarded as a fripndly and al^ed tribe, and may be killed in

retaliation only. No Kenyah will kill a dog, and the dead body of a dog is re-

garded with fear.

    Kenyahs will not eat the flesh of deer or horned cattle, and there are many

restrictions on touching or using any parts of them.

Only old or renowned warriors will wear or touch the skin of a tiger.

One house is decorated with carvings of the gibbon on every large beam, and

all Kenyahs have a dread of the Maias and the long-nosed monkey.

There thus seems to be every degree of regard paid to the different beasts,

from the mere uneasy feeling in the presence of the uncanny long-nosed monkey

to the elaborate cult of the hawk, and the nature of the respect paid to any species
seems in nearly every case to be the direct expression of the impression made on

the barbarian's mind by the behaviour of the beasts.

The Spirit-Helper.--EiNBvy Sea-Dayak hopes to be guided and helped all

through his life by a spirit which announces itself to him in dreams and takes up

its abode in some peculiar natural object or in some animal. In the latter case

the Dayak will never kill or eat one of the same species of animal, and will lay

the same prohibition on all his descendants, so that a whole family may come to
Apay especial regard to one species of animal for many generations.

institution occurs, though less commonly, among the other tribes. In such cases

we seem to be able to trace sometimes the actual origin and growth of a totem.

            5. Perforate Humeri in Ancient Egyptian Skeletons,
                     By Professor A. Macalister, F.R.S.

In sorting out our Cambridge collection of Egyptian bones I have noted the

frequency of supra-articular perforation of the humerus, especially in the bones
from Libyan graves. I did not begin to count the number of examples until more
than three-fourths of the series had been put away in store-cases, but out of the
last twenty boxes opened I found that out of 682 humeri 390 were perforate and

292 imperforate. The percentage of perforation is therefore 57'2.

This exceeds anything hitherto published. Of ancient North Americans the

percentage of perforate bones out of 300 specimens is 40 per cent. In one collection

from the Gila Valley, in Arizona, 48 perforate bones were found out of 89, a per-

centage of  53-9                         but  this is exceptionally high, and  the  number  of  bones  is  not
                                      ;

large. In our Cambridge collection when I began to count I found out of the

first 115 bones that 65 were perforated ; so, had I none but this series, the percent-
age would have come out 565.

    The Libyans may therefore, I think, claim to hold the record. In our dissect-

ing-room there were three instances out of the last hundred bodies examined.

     The authors just quoted are most probably correct in considering this as an
acquired character. The youngest specimen obtained was in a humerus of a child

probably six years old. I have not seen any genuine approach to this condition

among 100 foetal humeri examined for the purpose. As far as I know, it has never

been found in a foetal bone.

It is a perforation of the shaft well above the epiphysial junction line. The

distal extremity of the diaphysis thickens below the hole down to the place where

the epiphysis is set upon it.
     It is always in the intra-articular part of the olecranon fossa, helow the line of

reflexion of the synovial membrane that crosses the middle of the fossa. It is
therefore quite distinct from the vascular holes with which Topinard associates it,
as these are always extra-articular [the vessels are chiefly derived from the inferior

profunda].

    Of these perforate humeri 172 were right and 218 were left. As far as could

be determined from size, shape, and from the accompanying pelvic bones, 192 were
male and 198 were female. There is thus the same preponderance of left and
female over right and male bones which was noticed by the describers of the

Hemenway Collection, leading one to speculate as to the nature of the work which

--predisposed to the perforation the mill, the shadoof, or the mattock.

axis transverse or nearly so, and the distribution of their sizes is shown in the

7. On Crania collected by Mr. J. Stanley Gardiner in his Exjjedition to
                    Rotuma. By W. L. H. Duckworth.

The subject of this communication is a collection of nine crania from the above-

mentioned locality. The results of a craniological investigation show that while

considerable individual differences exist, there are at least two types of skull to be

met -with in the island of Rotuma. These are in the first place a variety of the

form of cranium usually found among Polynesian natives, though possessing certain

characteristics  which  may almost  be described  as  Mongolian                                                     and  in the second

place the type of cranium characteristic of Melauesians occurs in Mr. Gardiner's

collection. That such different types should be met with in one small island is in

accordance with what would be expected on a priori grounds when it is considered

that Rotuma is situated at the centre of contact of three important ethnical areas,

viz., the Polynesian to the east, the Melanesian to the south-west, and the

Micronesian (where Mongolian elements are discernible among the natives) to the

north-west.

8. A System of Classification of Finger Impressions. By J. G. Garsox,
   M.D., Bxjjert Adviser and Instructor on Identification, Home Office.

     This system of classification of finger impressions has been devised to be
worked in conjunction with classification of records by measurements of the head

and limbs for the purpose of facilitating search for previous records of criminals.

It is also applicable for the classification of small collections of records without

the concurrent use of measurements.

The objects aimed at in preparing this classification have been to get a moderate

number of divisions under which the various patterns and combinations of patterns

occurring in the arrangement of the ridges of the skin on the palmar surface of the

terminal phalanges of the digits of the hand may be classified, so that each divi-

sion shall contain approximately an equal percentage of the total number of
records dealt with, using for the purpose the fewest number of digits that will

suffice to get such a distribution, and including only the impressions of those digits

which are taken in all countries where the Bertillon system of identification has been

--adopted namely, the first four digits of the right hand. The patterns which the

ridges form are four in number, and are graphically indicated by the use of the

following signs :^

             An arch thus                                                                                           /\

    The representations of the ridge-patterns depicted by these signs from the im«

pressions of the several digits in order of succession constitute the finger formula
of an individual, which should be noted on a prominent part of each record so as

to be readily seen.

     It has been found that the patterns and their combinations on the thumb and
three following fiugers may be conveniently arranged in ten divisions. The thumb
and forefinger are always required in the classification, but when the divisions

given by these digits are large, the middle finger or the middle and ring finger

possible 10 per cent, of the total number of records.

     In the first instance the records are classified into two divisions bj the ridge*

of loop ; B, a whorl.

Each of these two groups is broken up into four smaller divisions by the

Of the eight divisions thus obtained no further subdivision is necessary of six
A Bgroups--namely, of a, b, and d of the

division.

AIn the division, further subdivision of the r. group by the middle and ring

fingers ia necessary.                                                                                           This is done by separating the cases where there are loops on
                                                                                                             _

each of the four digits from those in which there is any other combination of

patterns on the thumb, mid, and ring fiugers. Thus we obtain five groups in this

iirst division.

   B --Again, in the division namely, the cases in which there is a whorl on the

--thumb subdivision has to be resorted to in the d group when there is a whorl on

the forefinger as well as on the thumb. This is done by separating the cases where

the middle finger bears a whorl from those in which there is an arch or either form
of loop. Thus we obtain five groups in this second division.

    We have now got ten groups, which are of approximately equal size, except

--the a group Bof the division that in which the thumb bears a whorl and the

forefinger an arch, which is considerably smaller than the others, but this cannot
be obviated. In any given number of individuals there will always be some

in whom one or more of the four fingers used in classification have been damaged

from some cause or other, so that the pattern of the ridges is undecipherable, or
one or more fingers of either hand have been lost partially or completely ; espe-
cially is this the case amongst the labouring classes in manufacturing districts or
towns. In adult criminals such cases amount to about 6-5 per cent. In any s\'stem

of classification it is necessary to provide for such cases either by making a separate

group of them or by placing them with some other group as may be found more con-

Bvenient. If the latter course be adopted, and they are added to a of the group,

it will be brought up to the level of several of the other groups.

     The following is the scheme of classification reduced to tabular form, and the
approximate percentage of the records in each of the ten divisions is indicated

                1. The Sense of Effort and the Percej^fion of Force.

                         By Professor G. J. Stokes, M.A.

     According to the most generally accepted view the idea of force is obtained
from the muscular sense. It has also been attributed to touch. The most
important question is whether the perception is connected with the motor or
sensory nerves. If the latter view be adopted, it has been thought that this sensa-

tion can reveal nothing of the nature of the objective cause. As recent investiga-

tion seems to compel the adoption of the latter view, the objective character of the

perception can only be saved if we admit the presence of an objective character in

all sensation. If "Wundt's theory of the original functional indifference of the

nerves be accepted, we may yet be enabled to remove the difficulties in the way of

admitting such an objective character. The true difference between the perception
of force and other sensations will then lie, not in the process by which the pheno-

Wemenon is apprehended, but in the nature of the phenomenon apprehended.

--may thus have an apprehension of an objective external reality the same reality

which underlies the phenomena of dynamics. The principle of Least Action
may perhaps explain the directive character of vital and voluntary processes.

                           2. On Interpolation in 2Iemory}
                   By Professor Marcus Hartog, M.A., D.Sc.

    Many educational syllabuses that profess to rest on a psychological base assume

that the only guidance for action is a sensation which has been memorised by
frequent repetition. The mind, however, seems to have the power of classifying
the memories of each category apart and in order of magnitude and direction,

completing the records of single memories with what may be compared with an

interpolation-curve, and even extrapolating on either side ; so that, if a suitable

response have been learned to a limited number of sensations, a new sensation of
the same category will j)roduce a new appropriate response. This capacity for in-
terpolating has been long recognised in various arts, and is known as ' faculty,'

' feeling,' «S:c. It has not, however, been definitely recognised by the psychologist,

who has asked whether the conscious memory and judgment can construct inter-

mediate sensations between those he has learned from experience, rather than
whether there is a power in virtue of which it can recognise the appropriate position

of new sensations, or appropriately act on the stimulus of new sensations when

they occur.
     "Similarly with combinations of intermediate sensations, the mind can simulta-

neously act on them and execute the combined appropriate response in much the
same way as the pencil of a tide-predicting machine is simultaneously acted upon
by the independent wheels. This is shown by the now received fact (finally proved

by Richet) that each mental act takes about the tenth of a second, and any act of
conscious {sit veniu verbo) combination and judgment is usually out of the question
from a lack of adequate time.

      Illustrations of these views were quoted from the domains of housekeeping, the
plastic arts, cards, billiards, and language. It was urged that a priori methods of
instruction based on incomplete premises must be regarded with extreme caution.

3. Tke Defensive Earthworks of Yorkshire. By Mrs. Armitage,

  --The author describes the various types of earthworks in Yorkshire Roman
--camps, hill forts, and houndary earthworks and gives a summary of the results

of recent researches regarding these three classes of earthworks.

   A fourth class very frequent in Yorkshire is the moated hillock, with moated

court attached. It has been assigned in turn to the Britons, Romans, Saxons, and

Danes. The author gives reasons why none of these views is probable, and shows
the erroneousness of the theory of Mr. G. T. Clark, now so widely accepted, that the

Anglo-Saxon burh was a hillock of this kind, its meaning in Anglo-Saxon literature
being clearly !x fortified toion. The author produces the following arguments for
the Norman origin of these hillocks (called by the Normans mottes) : (a) the
Normans are known to have built such earthworks in Normandy and Ireland,

and are represented in the Bayeu.x tapestry as throwing up a similar work at

5. On the Occurrence of Flint Implements of Palceolithic Type on an old

     Land-surface in Oxfordshire, near Wolvercote and Pear Tree Hill,

    together with a few Implenients of various Plateaic Types. By A. M.

     Bell, M.A.

At "Wolvercote, near Oxford, there is a large section of a quaternary river-gravel

which has produced the usual fauna, Elephas primigenius &c., and many fine

implements of human workmanship. This gravel cuts into and is consequently

Anewer than a previous land-surface.                                                                                                                                                           portion of this surface is found at

Wolvercote and another portion at Pear Tree HiU, about half a mile distant.

In both places flint implements of palaeolithic type, together with bulbed flakes

and a few implements of plateau type, have been found. In every case the flints

are ochreous, which distinguishes them from those which belong to the river-

gravel at Wolvercote.

The older surface has been previously described as Northern Drift. It is sup-

posed by the author to be a remayiiement of the true Northern Drift, but to have

been deposited under semi-frozen conditions. It must be anterior to the river-

valley, and consequently its relics of man are the oldest as yet obtained from the
Thames Valley.

     The drift in question most resembles the drifts of Caddington, described by
Mr, G. Worthington Smith, and some sections of the Lower Greensand near

Limpsfield. Both of these drifts are implementiferous, and the author would

correlate the Wolvercote and Pear Tree Hill surface with these drifts.

highly probable that a more primitive stratum of the population is always to be

found in the upper ends of river valleys, the results are of great interest from this

point of view.

     The pigmentation and nose statistics of the whole of the people attending the
gathering, namely, 361 males and 243 females, were taken at the gate by two
observers. Later on the same statistics, with the addition of measurements of the

head and of stature, were taken in a tent in the grounds, about ninety adult males,
natives of the district, being measured. The people observed at the gate contained

a small percentage of visitors from a distance, which may account for the difference

in the results obtained at the gate and in the tent.

    In the head-breadth frequency curve of the population of E. Aberdeenshire we
found two well-marked peaks at 150 mm. and 155 mm., and two lesser peaks at
145 mm. and 160 mm. Taking these breadths as centres, we have divided the

people into four groups, the limiting breadths being marked opposite each group in

the above table.

    The general averages given in the table show that lu W. Aberdeenshire the

people have broader and longer heads : they are taller by f inch, they are darker in
hair and lighter in eyes, and they have rather higher percentages of Roman, wavy,
and concave noses than in E. Aberdeenshire.

     The first column in the table shows approximately the percentage which each
group forms of the population. Group I. is much better represented in the west

than in the east, being 50 per cent, of the population in the former case and only 14
per cent, in the latter case. The average breadths and lengths of the head in this
group come out almost exactly the same in the west and in the east, and the
stature (5 feet 9^ inches), which is very high for an average, diflers only by 5- inch in
the two places. The nigrescence, which is calculated by a formula in which the rela-
tive value and percentage of all the colours are taken into account,* shows that in both
the east and the west this group is darker in hair and lighter in eyes than the

general average of the population. It is evidently the presence of a larger per-

centage of this group in the west which accounts for its superiority in physique
over the east. Group II. is well represented in both east and west. Groups III.
and IV. ai-e, however, almost completely absent in the west, the total numbers,
eleven and two, in these groups in the west being so small as to make the averages

for stature, &c., given in the table unreUabie.

     It seems reasonable to conclude from these results that, in Aberdeenshire, at
some distant date, an early, tall, broad-headed, light-eyed people have been driven

inland by later immigrants, who were shorter, had narrower heads, and were of the

blonde type.

    A frequency curve of breadths of round barrow heads shows that Groups I.

and II. were well represented in the Bronze age in the British Isles. Groups III.

and IV. have the breadths of long barrow heads, which, however, are much longer
(208 mm. on the average). The Bowgrave heads of N. Germany, whose average
length is given as about 200 mm., come much nearer to Group III. ; and as these

probably represent the aboriginal blonde race of N. Germany, it is reasonable to

assume that our Group III. represents blonde immigrants from N. Germany, who
when they arrived in Aberdeenshire found the country in possession of a tall, "broad-
headed, dark-haired, blue-eyed people, the descendants of the men of the Bronze ao-e.
The resemblance of Group I. to Deniker's Adriatic type is significant when taken

in conjunction with the fact that bronze first came into the British Isles from S.E.

Eurone.

--Pkesidest of the Sectiox Professor Sxdjiet H. Vines, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.

          THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.

    In the absence of tlie President the following Address was read by Dr. D. II.

ScoTX, F.R.S. :--

There has been considerable difference of opinion as to whether the present year
marks the close of the nineteenth or the beginning of the twentieth century. But
whatever may be the right or the wrong of this vexed question, the fact that

the year-date now begins with 19, instead of with 18, suggests the appropriate-
ness of devoting an occasion such as the present to a review of the century which

has closed, as some will have it, or, In the opinion of others, is about to close. I
therefore propose to address you upon the progress of Botany during the nineteenth

century.

I am fully conscious of the magnitude of the task which I am undertaking,

mymore especially in its relation to the limits of time and space at  disposal. So

eventful has the period been that to give in any detail an account of what has

been accomplished during the last hundred years would mean to write the larger

half of the entire history of Botany. This being so, it might appear almost

hopeless to attempt to deal with so large a subject in a Presidential Address. But

I trust that the very restrictions under which I labour may prove to be rather
advantageous than otherwise, inasmuch as they compel me to confine attention

to what is of primary importance, and thus to give special prominence to the main

lines along which the development of the science has proceeded.

                                                                     Statistics.

    "We may well begin with what is, after all, the most fundamental matter, viz.,
the relative" numbers of known species of plants at the beginning and at the end of
the century. It might ai^pear tliat the statistics of plants was a subject susceptible

of very simple treatment, but unfortunately this is not the case. It must be
remembered that a 'species' is not an iu variable standard unit, like a pound
or a pint, but that it is an Idea depenrlent upon the subjectivity of individual

botanists. For Instance, one botanist may regard a certain number of similar

plants as all belonging to a single species, whilst another maj' find the differences

among them such as to warrant the distinction of as many species as there are

plants. It is this Inevitable variation in the estimation of specific characters which
renders it difficult to deal satisfactorily with plants from the statistical point of

view. However, the following figures may be regarded as giving a fair Idea of

the increase in the number of ' good ' species of living plants.
     It la generally stated that about 10,000 species of plants were known to

Ijlnnseus in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of which about one-tenth
were Cryptogams ; but so rapid was the progress in the study of new plants at

that time that the first enumeration of plants published In the nineteenth century,

the 'Synopsis' of Persoon (1807), included as many as 20,000 species ofPhanerogams
alone. Turning now to the end of the century, we arrive at the following census,
for which I am indebted mainly to Professor Saccardo (189:i) and tu Professor

jaa the approximate number of recognised species of living plants.

    These hgiires are sufficiently accurate to show how vast have been the additions
to the knowledge of plants in the period under consideration, and they afford much
food for thought. In the first place, they indicate how closely connected has been
the growth of this branch of Botany with the exploration and opening up of new

countries which has been so characteristic a feature of the century. Again, no one
can consider these figures without being struck by the disparity in the numbers of
species included in the different groups ; a most interesting topic, which cannot,

however, be entered upon here. It must suffice to point out in a general way that

the smaller groups represent families of plants which attained their numerical

zenith in long past geological periods, and are now decadent, whilst the existing

flora of the world is characterised by the preponderating Angiosperms and Fungi.
918 REPORT-- 1900.

   We may venture to cast a forward glance upon the possible future develop-

ment of the knowledge of species. Various partial estimates have been made as
to the probable number of existing species of this or that group, but the only com-
prehensive estimate with which 1 am acquainted is that of Professor Saccardo
(1892). He begins with a somewhat startling calculation to the effect that there
are at least 250,000 existing species of Fungi alone, and he goes on to suggest that
probably the number of species belonging to the various other groups would
amount to 150,000 ; hence the total number of species now living is to be estimated
at over 400,OUO. On the basis of this estimate it appears that we have not yet
made the acquaintance of half the contemporary species ; so that there remains

plenty of occupation for systematic and descriptive botanists, especially in the de-
partment of Fungology. It is also rather alarming, in view of the predatory

instincts of so many of the Fungi, to learn that they constitute so decided a majority

of the whole vegetable kingdom.
     In spite of the great increase in the number of known species, it cannot be said

that any essentially new type of plant has been discovered during the century. So
far as the bounds of the vegetable kingdom have been extended at all, it has been
by the annexation of groups hitherto regarded as within the sphere of influence of
the zoologists. The most notable instance of this has occurred in the case of the
Bacteria, or Schizomycetes, as Naegeli termed them. These organisms, discovered
by Leeuwenhoek 200 yeai'S ago, had always been regarded as infusorian animals
until, in 1863, Cohn recognised their vegetable nature and their affinity with the
Fungi. These plants have acquired special importance, partly on account of the
controversy which arose as to their supposed spontaneous generation, but more
especially on account of their remarkable zymogeuic and pathogenic properties, so
that Bacteriology has become one of the new sciences of the century.

                                                            Classification.

     Having gained some idea of the number of species which have been recognised
and described during the century, the next point for consideration is the progress
made in the attempt to reduce this mass of material to such order that it can be
intelligently apprehended; in a word, to convert a mass of facts into a science;
'Filum ariadneum Botanices est systema, sine quo chaos est Ees Herbaria'

 (Linnaeus).

     The classi6cation of plants is a problem which has engaged attention fi'om the

very earliest times. AVithout attempting to enter into the history of the matter,

I may just point out that, speaking generally, all the earlier systems of classifica-

tion were more or less artificial, the subdivisions being based upon the distinctive

features of one set of members of the plant. When I say that of all these systems

that proposed by Linufeus (1735) was the most purely artificial, I do not imply
 any reproach : if it was the most artificial, it was at the same time the most
 serviceable, and its author was fully aware of its artificiality. This system is
 generally regarded as his most remarkable achievement ; but the really great
 service which Linnreus rendered to science was the clear distinction which he for
 the first time drew between systems which are artificial and those which are
 natui-al. Kecognising, as he did, his inability to frame at that period a satisfactory
 natural system, he also realised that with the increasing number of known plants
 some more ready means of determining them was an absolute necessity, and it was
 for this purpose that he devised his artificial system, not as an end, but as a means.
 The end to be kept in view was the natural classification : ' Methodus naturalis

 est ultimus finis ISotanices ' is his clearly expressed position in the ' Philosophia

 Botanica.'

       There is a certain irony in the fact that the enthusiastic acceptance accorded
 to his artificial system throughout the greater part of Europe contributed to post-
 pone the realisation of Linnseus's cherished hopes with regard to the attainment of

 a natural classification, It was just in those countries, such as Germany and
 England, where the Linnean system was most readily adopted that the develop-
 ment of the natural system proceeded most slowly. It was in France, where the
 Linnean system never secured a firm hold, that the quest of the natural system was
                                                                                                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  919

pursued ; and it is to French botanists more particularly that our present classi-

fication is due. It may be traced from its first beginnings with Magnol in 1G89,
through the bolder attempts of Adanson and of Bernard de Jussieu (1759), to the

relatively complete method propounded by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in his

'Genera Plantarum,' just 100 years later.

The nineteenth century opened with the struggle for predominance between

the Jussiean and the Linnean systems. In England the former soon obtained con-

siderable support, notably that of Robert Brown, whose * Prodromus Florae Novae

Hollandise,' published in 1810, seems to have been the first English botanical work
in which the natural system was adopted ; but it did not come into general use until

it had been popularised by Lindley in the thirties.

     Meantime the Jussiean system had been extended and improved by Auguste
Pyrame de Candolle (1813-24). It is essentially the Candollean classification

which is now most generally in use, and it has been immortalised by its adoption in
Bentham and Hooker's ' Genera Plantarum,' one of the great botanical monu-

ments of the centm-y. In Germany, however, it has been widely departed from,

the system there in vogue being based upon Brongniart's modification (1828, 1850)
of de Candolle's method as elaborated successively by Alex. Braun(lS64), Eichler
(1876-83), and Professor Engler (1886, 1898). It must be admitted that for

the last fifty years the further evolution of the natural system, at any rate so far
as Phanerogams are concerned, has been confined to Germany.

One of the more important advances in the classification of Phanerogams was

based upon Robert Brown's discovery in 1827 of the gymnospermous nature of the

ovule in Conifers and Cycads, which led Brongniart (1828) to distinguish these
plants as ' Phanerogames gymnospermes ; ' and although the systematic position of

these plants has since then been the subject of much discussion, the recognition
of the Gymnospermfe as a distinct group of archaic Phanerogams is now definitely

accepted.

Moreover, the greatly increased knowledge of the Cryptogams has involved a

considerable reconstruction in the classification of that great sub-kingdom. One of
the most striking discoveries is that first definitely announced by Schwendener (1869)
concerning Lichens, to the effect that the body of a Lichen consists of two distinct

organisms, an Alga and a Fungus, living in symbiosis; a discovery which was so
nearly made by other contemporary botanists, such as de Bary, Berkeley, and
Sachs, and which can be traced back to Haller and Gleditsch in the eighteenth

century.

But the discoveries which most affected the classification of the Cryptogams are

those relating to their reproduction. Whilst it bad been recognised, almost from

time immemorial, that Phanerogams reproduce sexually, sexuality was denied to

Cryptogams until the observations on Liverworts and Mosses by Schmidel and by

Hedwig (of whom it was said that he was born to banish Cryptogamy) in the

eighteenth century                                                                                        and even as late as 1828 we find Brongniart classifying the Fungi  .
                                                                                                       ;

and Algse together as ' Agames.' But in the middle third of the nineteenth century,

by the labours of such men as Thuret, Pringsheim, Cohn, Hofmeister, Naegeli, and

de Bary, the sexuality of all classes of Cryptogams was clearly established. It is
worthy of note that, although the sexuality of the Phanerogams had been accepted

for centuries, yet the details of sexual reproduction w^ere first investigated in Crypto-

gams. For it was not until 1823 that Amici discovered the pollen-tube, and it was
more than twenty years later (1846) before he completed his discovery by ascer-

taining the true significance of the pollen-tube in relation to the development of the

embryo ; whilst it remained for Strasburger to observe, thirty years later, the actual

process of fertilisation.

     The discovery of the reproductive processes in Cryptogams not only facilitated

a natural classification of them, but had the further very important effect of throw-
ing light upon their relation to Phanerogams. Perhaps the most striking botanical

achievement of the nineteenth century has been the demonstration by Hofmeister's

unrivalled researches (^1851) that Phanerogams and Cryptogams are not separated,
as was formerly held, by an impassable gulf, but that the higher Cryptogams and
the lower Phanerogams are connected by many common features.
--920 REPORT 1900.

    The development of the natural classification, of which an account has now been

given, proceeded for the most part on the assumption of the immutability of species.

As Linnaeus expressed it in his 'Fundamenta Botanica,' ' species tot numeramus, quot

diversse formae in principio sunt creatse.' It is difficult to understand how, with the
point of view, the idea of affinity between species could have arisen at all ; and yet
the establishment of genera and the attempts at a natural system prove tliat the
idea was operative. The nature of the prevalent conception of affinity is well con-
veyed by Linnseus's aphorism, ' Affines conveniunt habitu, nascendi modo, proprie-

tatibus, viribus, usu.'

     But a conviction had been gradually growing that the assumed fixity of species
was not well founded, and that, on the contrary, species are descended from pre-

existent species. This view found clear expression in Lamarck's ' Philosophie Zoo-

logique,' published early in the century (1809), but it did not strongly affect public

opinion until after the publication of Darmn's ' Origin of Species ' in 1859. Regarded

from this point of view the problems of classification have assumed an altogether

different aspect. Affinity no longer means mere similarity, but blood-relationship

Wedepending upon common descent.  no longer  seek   a ' system '  of classification
                                                                                                                                                        ;

we endeavour to determine the mutual relations of plants. The effect of this change

has been to stimulate the investigation of plants in all their parts and in all stages

of their life, so as to attain that complete knowledge of them without which their

affinities cannot be accurately estimated, If the classification of Cryptogams is, at

the present moment, in a more satisfactory position than that of Phanerogams, it is

just because the study of the former group has been, for various reasons, more

thorough and more minute than tliat of the latter.

                                                     Palceophytology.

    The stimulating influence of the new doctrine was not, liowever, confined to the

investigation of existing plants ; it also gave a remarkable impulse to the study of
fossil plants, inasmuch as the theory of descent involves the quest of the ancestors

of the forms that we now have around us. Marvellous progress has been made in
this direction during the nineteenth century, by the labours more especially of

Brongniart, Goeppert, Unger, Schimper, Scheuck, Saporta, Solms-Laubach,

Renault, on the Continent, and in our own country of Lindley and Hutton, Hooker,

Carruthers, and more especially of Williamson. So far-reaching are the results

obtained that I can only attempt the barest summary of them. I may perhaps

best begin by saying that only a small proportion of existing species have been
found in the fossil state. In illustration I may adduce the statement made by
Mr. Clement Reid in his recent work, ' The Origin of the British Flora,' that
only 270 species, that is, about one-sixth of the total number of British vascular
plants, are known as fossils. Making all due allowances for the imperfection of the
geological record, for the limited area investigated, and for the difficulty of deter-

mination of fragmentary specimens, it may be stated generally that the number of

 existing species has been found to rapidly diminish in the floras of successively
 older strata ; none, in fact, have been certainly found to persist beyond the Tertiary

 period. Certain existing genera, belonging to the Gymnosperms and to the Pteri-
 dophyta, have, however, been traced far down into the Mesozoic period. Similarly,

 the distribution in time of existing natural orders does not coincide with that of
 existing genera; thus the Ferns of the Carboniferous epoch apparently belong, for
 the most part, if not altogether, to the order Marattiacese, but they are not refer-
 able to any of the existing genera.

     Moreover, altogether new families of fossil plants have been discovered : such
 are, among Gymnosperms, the Cordaitaceoe and the Bennettitacese ; among Pteri-

 dophyta, the Calamariacese, the Lepidodendracere, the Sphenophyllaceas, and the
 Cycadofilices. It is of interest to note that all these newly discovered families can
 be included within the main subdivisions of the existing flora ; in fact, no fossil
 plants have been found which suggest the existence in the past of groups outside
 the limits of our Phanerogamia, Pteridophyta, Bryophyta, and Thallophyta.

      It cannot be said that the study of Palseobotany has as yet made clear the

ancestry and the descent of our existing flora. To begin with the angiospermous
aowering plants, it has been ascertained that they make their first appearance in
tlie bretaceous epoch, but we have no clue as to their origin. The relatively late
appearance of Angiosperms in geological time suggests that they must have spruno'
trom an older                                group, such

origin ot the Gymnosperms, whilst it cannoD be doubted that thev were derived
trom the Pteridophyta, the existing data are insufficient to enable us to trace
their pedigree. The most ancient family of Gymnosperm.s, the Cordaitacea, can
be traced as far back as any known Pteridophyta, and cannot, thereibre, have been
derived irom them · but the fact that the Cordaitace^ exhibit certain cycadean
attimties, and the discovery of the Cycadofilices, suggest that what may be termed
the cycadean phylum of Gymnosperms (including the Cordaitace£e, Bennettitaceje,
Gycadacese, and perhaps the Ginkgoacete) had its origin in a filicineous ancestry
ot which. It must be admitted, no forms have as yet been recognised

are more primitive than the leptosporangiate. With regard to the Equisetin^
the Galamariacese were no doubt the ancestors of the existing and of the fossil
iiquisetums. Similarly, in the Lycopodinte, the palfcozoic Lepidodendracefe were
the lorerunners of the existing Lycopodiums and Selaginellas. The discovery of
t^e bphenophyllaceas seems to throw some further light upon the phylogeny of
these two groups, inasmuch as these plants possess characters which indicate affinity
with both the Equisetinje and the Lycopodinse, thus suggesting
they may have sprung from the same ancestral stock. °                                         the  ^possibilit^y                                                                       that

     If inquiry te made as to the cause of the great advance iu the recognition of
the true affinities of plants, and consequently in their classification, which distin-
guishes the nineteenth century, I would refer it to the progress made in the study

of morphology. The earlier botanists regarded all the various parts of plants as

'organs' in relation to their supposed function ; hence their description of plants

was simply 'organography.' The idea of regarding the parts of the plant-body,
not in connection with their functions, but with reference to their development
and their mutual relations, seems to have originated with Jung in the seventeenth

century (1687) : it was revived by 0. F. Wolff about seventy years later (1759),

but it did not materially aflect the study of plants until well on in the nineteenth
century, after Goethe had repeatedly written on the subject and had devised the

term ' morphology ' to designate it. For a time this somewhat abstract mode of
treatment led to mere theorising and speculation, so much so that the years

1820-1840 will always be stigmatised as the period of the ' Naturphilosophie.'

But fortunately this time of barrenness was succeeded by a veritable renascence.

Robert Brown and Henfrey in England ; Brongniart, iSt. Hilaire, and Tulasne

in France ; Mohl, Schleideii, Naegeli, A. Braun, and, above all, Hofmeister in

Germany, led the way back from the pursuit of fantastic will-o'-the-wisps to the
observation of actual fact. Instead of evolving schemes out of their own internal

consciousness as to how plants ought to be constructed, they endeavoured to
discover by the study of development, and more particularly of embryogeny, how

they actually are constructed, with the result that within a decade Hofmeister
discovered the alternation of generations in the higher plants; a discovery which

must ever rank as one of the most brilliant triumphs of morphological research.

With the knowledge thus acquired it became possible to determine the true

relations of the various parts of the plant-body; to distinguish these parts as

' members ' rather than as ' organs ; ' in a word, to establish homologies where

--hitherto only analogies had been traced which is the essential difference between

morphology and organography.

The publication of the ' Origin of Species' profoundly aftected the progress of

morphology, as of all branches of biological research : but it did not alter its

Wetrend ; it confirmed and extended it.  are not satisfied now with establishing

homologies, but we go on to inquire into the origin and phylogeny of the members

of the body. In illustration I may briefly refer to two problems of this kind

which at the present time are agitating ihe botanical world. The first is as to

the origin of the alternation of generations. Did it come about by the modifica-

tion of the sexual generation  (gametophyte)  into an asexual  (sporophyte)                                                  or is the
                                                                                                                          ;

sporophyte a new formation intercalated into the life-history ? In a word, is the

alternation of generations to be regarded as homologous or as antithetic r I am

not rash enough to express any opinion on this controversy ; uor is it necessary

that I should do so, since the subject has twice been threshed out at recent

meetings of this Section. The second problem is as to the origin of the sporophylls,

and, indeed, of all the various kinds of leaves of the sporophyte in the higher

plants. It is suggested, on the one hand, that the sporophylls of the Pteridophyta
have arisen by gradual sterilisation and segmentation from an unsegmented and

almost wholly reproductive body, represented in our day by the sporogouium

of the Bryophyta ; and that the vegetative leaves have been derived by further

sterilisation from the sporophylls. On the other liand, it is urged that the

vegetative leaves are the more primitive, and that the sporophylls have been derived

from them. It will be at once observed that this second problem is intimately

connected with the first. The sterilisation theory of the origin of leaves is a

necessary consequence of the antithetic view of the alternation of generations
whilst the derivation of sporophylls from foliage-leaves is similarly associated with

the homologous view. Here, again, exercising a wise discretion, I will only

venture to express my appreciation of the important work which has been done in

--connection with this controversy work that will be equally valuable, whatever

the issue may eventually be.

1 will conclude my remarks on morphology witli a few illustrations of the aid

which the advance in this department has given to the progress of classiflcation.

For instance, Linnajus divided plants into Phanerogams and Cryptogams, on the

ground that in the former the reproductive organs and processes are conspicuous,

whereas in the latter they are obscure. In view of our increased knowledge of

Cryptogams this ground  of distinction is  no  longer  tenable                                whilst  still recog-
                                                                                           ;

nising the validity of the division, our reasons for doing so are altogether diflerent.

For us. Phanerogams are plants which produce a seed ; Cryptogams are plants

which do not produce a seed. Again, we distinguish the Pteridophyta and the

Bryophyta from the Thallophyta, not on account of their more complex structure,

but mainly on the ground that the alternation of generations is resular in the two

former groups, whilst it is irregular or altogether wanting in the latter. Similarly

the essential distinction between the Pteridophyta and the Bryophyta is that in

the former the sporophyte, in the latter the ga'metophyte, is the p'repouderating

form. It has enabled us further to correct in many respects the classifications of

our predecessors by altering the systematic position of various genera, and some-

times of larger groups. Thus the Cycadaceaj have been removed from among the

Monocotyledons, and the Conifers from among the Dicotyledons, where

de Candolle placed them, and have been united with the Gnetaceie into the

sub-class Gymnospermffi. The investigation of the development of the flower, in

which Payer led the way, and the elaboration of the floral diagram which we owe

to Eichler, have don(3 much, though by no means all, to determine the ailinities of

doubtful Angiosperms, especially among those previously relegated to the lumber-

room of the Apetalffi.

                                   Anatomy and Histology.

     Passing now to the consideration of the progress of knowledge concerning the

structure of plants, the most important result to'be chronicled is the discovery that
the plant-body consists of living substance indistinguishable from that of which
the body of animals is composed. The earlier anatomists, whilst recognising the

cellular structure of plants, had confined their attention to the examination of the
cell-walls, and described the contents as a watery or mucilaginous sap, without
determining where or what was the seat of life. In 1831 Robert Brown dis-
covered the nucleus of the cell, but there is no evidence that he regarded it as
living. It was not until the renascence of research in the forties, to which I have
already alluded, that any real progress in this direction was made. The cell-

contents were especially studied by Naegeli and by Mohl, both of whom recognised

the existence of a viscous substance lining the wall of all living cells as a ' mucous
layer ' or ' primordial utricle,' but diflering chemically from the substance of the
wall by being nitrogenous: this they regarded as the living part of the cell, and
to it Mohl (1846) gave the name 'protoplasm,' which it still bears. The full

significance of this discovery became apparent iu a somewhat roundabout way.
Dujardin, in 1835, had described a number of lowly organisms, which he termed

Infusoria, as consisting of a living substance, which he called ' sarcode.' Fifteen

j-ears later, in a remarkable paper on Protococnts phaialis, Cohn drew attention to
the similarity in properties between the ' sarcode ' of the Infusoria and the living
substance of this plant, and arrived at the brilliant generalisation that the ' proto-
plasm ' of the botanists and the 'sarcode' of the zoologists are identical. Thus

arose the great conception of the essential unity of life in all living things, which,

thanks to the subsequent labours of such me'n as de Bary, Briicke, '^and Max

ASchultze, in the first instance, has become a fundamental canon of Biology.

         conspicuous monument of this period of activity is the cell-theory pro-
pounded by Schwann in 1839. Briefly stated, Schwann's theory was that all living

bodies are built up of structural units which are the cells : each cell possesses an
independent vitality, so that nutrition and growth are referable, not to the
organism as a whole, but to the individual cells. This conception of the structure

of plants was accepted for many years, but it has had to give way before the
advance of anatomical knowledge. The recognition of cell-division as the process

--hj which the cells are multiplied in opposition to the Schleidenian theory of free
--cell-formation early sugs-ested doubts as to the propriety of re;?ardiDg the body as

being built up of cells as a wall is built of bricks. Later the minute study of the
Thallophyta revealed the existence of a number of plant?, such as the Myxomycetes,
the phycomycetous Fungi, and tlie siphonaceous Algos, some of them highly
organised, the vegetative body of which does not consist of cells. It became clear

that cellular structure is not essential to life ; that it may he altogether absent or
present in various degree. Thus in the higher plants the protoplasm is segmented

or septated by walls into uninucleate units or 'energids' (Sachs), and such plants
are well described as ' completely septate.' But in others, such as the higher Fungi
and certain Algie (e.g., Cladophora, Hydrodictiion), the protoplasm is septated, not
into energids, but into groups of energids, so that the body is ' incompletely
septate.' Finally there are the Thallophyta already enumerated, in which there is

complete continuity of the protoplasm : these are ' unseptate.' Moreover, even

when the body presents the most complete cellular structure, the energids are not

isolated, but are connected by delicate protoplasmic fibrils traversing the inter-
vening walls ; a fact which is one of the most striking discoveries in the depart-
ment of histology'. This was first recognised in the sieve-tubes by Hartig (1837) ;
then by Naegeli (1846) in the tissues of the Florideaj. After a long period of
neglect the matter was taken up once more by Tangl (1880), when it attracted the
attention of many investigator.?, as the result of whose labours, especially those of
Mr. Gardiner, the general and perhaps universal continuity of the protoplasm in
cellular plants has been established. Hence the body is no longer regarded as an
aggregate of cells, but as a more or less septated mass of protoplasm : tlie synthetic
standpoint of Schwann has been replaced by one as distinctively analytic.

     Time does not permit me to do more than mention the important discoveries
made of late j-ears, mainly on the initiative of Strasburger, with regard to the

details of cytology, and especially to the structure of the nucleus and the intricate
dance of the chromosomes in karyokinesis. Indeed, I can do but scant justice to
those anatomical discoveries which are of more exclusively botanical interest. One

important generalisation which may be drawn is that the histological differentia-

tion of the plant proceeds, not in the protoplasm, as in the animal, but in the cell-

wall. It is remarkable, on the one hand, how similar the protoplasm is, not only
in different parts of the same body, but in plants of widely diflerent affinities ; and,
on the other, what diversity the cell-wall offers in thickness, chemical composition,

and physical properties. In studying the differentiation of the cell-wall the
botanist has received valuable aid from the chemist. Research in this direction
may, in fact, be said to have begun with Payen's fundamental discovery (1844)
that the characteristic and primary chemical constituent of the cell-wall is the
carbohydrate which he termed cellulose.

     The amount of detailed knowledge as to the anatomy of plants which has been

accumulated during the century by countless workers, among whom Mohl, Naegeli,

--Unger, and Sanio deserve special mention as pioneers, is very great so great,

indeed, that it seemed as if it must remain a mere mass of facts in the absence of
any recognisable general principles which might serve to m.arshal the facts into a
science. The first step towards a morphology of the tissues was Hanstein's investi-
gation of the growing point of the Phanerogams (1868), and his recognition therein
of the three embryonic tissue-systems. This has lately been further developed by
the promulgation of van Tieghem's theory of the stele, which is merely the logical
outcome of Hanstein's distinction of the plerome. It has thus become possible to
determine the homologies of the tissue-systems in different plants and to organise
the facts of structure into a scientific comparative anatomy. It has become appa-
rent that, in many cases, differences of structure are immediately traceable to the
influence of the environment; in fact, the study of physiological or adaptive

anatomy is now a large and important branch of the subject.
     The study of Anatomy has contributed in some degree to the progress of

systematic Botany. It is true that some of the more ambitious attempts to base
classification on Anatomy have not been successful ; such, for instance, as de
CandoUe's subdivision of Phanerogams into Exogens and Endogens, or the subdivision

until they are confirmed or disproved by the discovery and investigation of the

WeThe last branch of botanical science which I propose to pass in review is that
of physiology.                              may well begin with the nutritive processes. At the close of

the eighteenth century there was practically no coherent theory of nutrition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        such
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;
as it was it amounted to little more than the conclusion arrived at by van He'lmont
a century and a half earlier, that plants require only water for their food, and are
able to form from it all the different constituents of their bodies. It is true that the

important discovery had been made ai)d pursued by Priestley (1772), Ingen-Housz

(1780), and Senebier (1782) that gTeen plants exposed to light absorb carb'ou dioxide
and evolve free oxygen
                                                                                                                               ;  but this gaseous interchange had not been shown to be the

expression of a nutritive process. At the opening of the nineteenth century (1804)
this connection was established by de Saussure, in his classical ' Recherches
Chimiques,' who demonstrated that, whilst absorbing carbon dioxide and evolving

oxygen, green plants gain in dry weight ; and he further contributed to the eluci-

dation of the problem of nutrition by showing that, whilst assimilating carbon

dioxide, green plants also assimilate the hydrogen and oxygen of water.

Three questions naturally arose in connection with de" Saussure's statement of
                                            What is the nature of the organic substance formed ?
the case                                                                                                                                                                                                   What is the
                                         :

function of the_ chlorophyll ? What is the part played by light ? It was far on in

the ceutury before answers were forthcoming.

     With regard to the first of these questions the researches of Boussingault
(1864) and others established the fact that the volume of carbon dioxide absorbed
and that of oxygen evolved in connection with the process are approximately equal.

Further, the frequent presence of starch in the chloroplastids, to which Mohl first
drew attention (1837), was subsequently found by Sachs (1802) to be closely con-
nected with the assimilation of carbon dioxide. The conclusion drawn from these

facts is that the gain in dry weight accompanying the assimilation of carbon
dioxide is due to the formation, in the first instance, of organic substance havino-

the composition of a carbohydrate ; a conclusion which may be expressed by the

equation

                                                                                                                                  C0,, + ILO = CILO + Oo.

     The questions with regard to chlorophyll and to light are so intimately con-
nected that they must be considered together. The first step towards their
solution was the investigation of the relative activity of light of different colours

ori<,'inally undertaken by Senebier (1782) and subsequently repeated by Daubeny

(LS-ib), with the result that red and orange light was found to promote assimila-

tion in a higher degree than blue or violet light. Shortly afterwards Draper (1843)
espe^im^ntiug with an actual solar spectrum, concluded that the most active rays

are the orange and yellow; a conclusion which was generally accepted for many

years. But in the meantime the properties of the green colouring matter of plants
(^to which Pelletier and Caveutou gave the name ' chloropliyll ' in 1817) were bein"-

investigated. Brewster discovered in 1834 that an alcoholic extract of o-reeu

leaves presents a characteristic absorption spectrum ; but many years elapsed before
any attempt was made to connect this property with the pliysi'ological activity of
chlorophyll. It was not until 1871-72 that Lommel and N. J. C. Miiller pointed

out that the rays of the spectrum which are most completely absorbed b\' chloro-
phyll are just those which are most efficient in the assimilation of carbon dioxide.
Subsequent researches, particularly those of Timiriazefl' (1877), and those of En»el-
                                                                                                                                  ;

mann (188/!-84) based on his ingenious Bacterium-method, have confirmed the
views of Lommel and of Miiller, and have placed it beyoud doubt that the import-

ance of light in the assimilatory process is that it is the form of kinetic energy
necessary to effect the chemical changes, and that the function of chlorophyll is
to serve as the means of absorbing this energy and of making it available for the

plant.

These are perhaps the most striking discoveries in relation to the nutrition of

plants, but there are others of not less importance to which brief allusion must be

Wemade.                           owe to de Saussure (1804) the first clear demonstration of the fact

that plants derive an important part of their food from the soil ; but the relative

nutritive value of the inorganic salts absorbed in solution was not ascertained until

Sachs (1858) reintroduced the method of water-culture which had originated

centuries before with Woodward (1699) and had been practised by Duhamel

(1768) and de Saussure. Special interest centres .iround the question of the

nitrogenous nutrition of plants. It was long held, chiefly on the authority of

Priestley and of Ingen-Housz, and in spite of the contrary opinion expressed by

Senebier, Woodhouse (1803), and de Saussure, that plants absorb the free nitrogen
of the atmosphere by their leaves. This view was not finally abandoned until
1860, when the researches of Boussingault and of Lawes and Gilbert deprived it

--of all foundation. Since then we have learned that the Free nitrogen of the air

can be made available for nutrition not indeed directly by green plants themselves,
but, as Berthelot and Winogradsky more especially have .shown, by Bacteria in the

soil, or, as apparently in the Leguminosse, by Bacteria actually enclosed in the roots

of the plants with which they live symbiotically.

   We turn now from the nutritive or anabolic processes to those which are catabolic.

The discovery of the latter, just as of the former, was arrived at by the investiga-

tion of the gaseous interchange between the plant and the atmosphere. In the
eighteenth century Scheele and Priestley had found that, under certain circum-

stances, plants deteriorate the quality of air ; but it is to Ingen-Housz that we owe

the disccivery that plants, like animals, respire, taking in oxygen and giving off

carbon dioxide. And when Sen6bier (1800) had ascertained for the inflorescence
of Arum maculatum, and later de Saussure (1822) fir other flowers, that active

respiration is associated with an evolution of heat, the connection between respiration

and catabolism %yas established for plants as it had been long before by Lavoisier

(1777) in the case of animals.

    Among the catabolic processes which have been investigated none are of greater

importance than those which are designated by the general term fermentations.

The first of these to be discovered was the alcoholic fermentation of sugar. Towards

the end of the seventeenth century Leeuwenhoek had detected minute globules in

fermenting wort ; and a century later Lavoisier had ascertained that the chemical

process consists in the decomposition of sugar into alcohol and carbon               dioxide                                      but
                                                                                                                               ;

it was not until 1837-38 that, almost simultaneously, Cagniard de Latour, Schwann,

and Kiitziug discovered that Leeuwenhoek's globules were living organisms, and

were the cause of the fermentation. Shortly before, in 1833, Payen and Persoz

extracted from malt a substance named diastase, which they found could convert

the starch of the grain into sugar. These two classes of bodies, causing fermentative

changes, were distinguished respectively as organised and unorganised ferments.
The number of the former was rapidly added to by the investigation more espe-
cially of the Bacteria, in which Pasteur led the way. The extension of our knowledge

of the unorganised ferments, or enzymes, has been even more remarkable : we now
know that very many of the metajjolic processes are eflected by various enzymes,

such as those which convert the more complex carbohydrates into others of simpler
constitution (diastase, cytase, glucase, inulase, invertase) ; those which decompose
glucosides (emulsin, myrosin, &c.) ; those which act on proteids (trypsins) and on
fats (lipases) ; the oxidases, which cause the oxidation of various organic substances
and the zymase, recently extracted from yeast, which causes alcoholic fermentation.

     The old distinction of the micro-organisms as * organised ferments ' is no longer

tenable                           for, on  the one  hand, certain of  the  chemical  changes which  they effect
                               ;

can b« traced to extractable enzymes which they produce ; and, on the other, as

Pasteur has asserted, every living cell may become an ' organised ferment ' under

appropriate conditions. The distinction now to be drawn is between those pro-

cesses which are due to enzymes and those directly eSected by living protoplasm.

Many now definitely included in the former class were, until lately, regarded as

belonging to the latter ; and no doubt future investigation will still further increase

the number of the former at the expense of the latter.

The consideration of the metabolic processes leads naturally to that of the

function of transpiration and of tlie means by which water and substances in

solution are distributed in the plant. This is perhaps the department of physiology

Wein which progress during the nineteenth century has been least marked.                                                                                                                                                                                                           have

got rid, it is true, of the old idea of an ascending crude sap, and of a descending

elaborated sap, but there have been no fundamental discoveries. With regard to
transpiration itself, we know more of the detail of the process, but that is all that
can be said. As for root-pressure, Hofmeister (1858-62) discovered that 'bleed-

-- --ing ' as the phenomena of root-pressure were termed by the earlier writers is not

confined, as had hitherto been thought, to trees and shrubs                                                                                                                                                                                                                        but the current theory
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

of the process, allowing for the discovery of protoplasm and of osmosis, has

advanced but little upon that given by Grew in the third book of his ' Anatomy

of Plants' (1675). Again, the mechanism of the transpiration-current in lofty

trees remains an unsolved problem. To begin with, there is still some doubt as to

the exact channel in which the current travels. Knight (1801-8) first proved that

the current travels in the alburnum of the trunk, but not, he thought, in the

vessels, for he found them to be dry in the summer, when transpiration is most

active; a view in which Dutrochet (1837) subsequently concurred. Meyen (1838)
then suggested that the water must travel, not in the lumina, but in the substance

of the cells of the vessels, and was supported by such eminent physiologists as

Hofmeister (1858), linger (1864, 1868), and Sachs (1878) ; but it has since been

strongly asserted by Boehm, Elfving, Vesque, Havtig, and Strasburger that the

young vessels always contain water, and that the current travels in the lumina and

not in the walls of the vessels.

Now as to the force by which the water of the transpiration-current is raised

from the roots to the topmost leaf of a lofty tree. From the point of view that

the water travels in the substance of the walls the necessary force need not be great,

and would be amply provided by the transpiration of the leaves, inasmuch as the

weight of the water raised would be supported by the force of imbibition of the walls.

From the point of view that the water travels in the lumina the force required to

raise and support such long columns of water must be considerable. Dismissing

at once as quite inadequate such purely physical theories as those of capillarity and

gas-pressure, there remain two theories as to the nature of this force which

resemble each other in being essentially vitalistic, but difier in that the one involves

pressure from below, the other suction from above. In the one, suggested by

Godlewski and by Westermaier (1884), the cells of the medullary rays and of the

wood-parenchyma are supposed to absorb liquid from the vascular tissue at one

level and force it back again by a vital act at a higher level : this theory was

disposed of by the fact that the transpiration-current can be maintained through a

considerable length of a stem killed by heat or by poison. In the other, sug^sted

by Dixon and Joly (1895-99 ), and also by Askenasy (1895-96), it is assumed that there

are, in the trunk of a transpiring tree, continuous columns of water which are in a

state of tensile stress, the tension being set up by the vital transpiratory activity of
the leaves. Some idea of the enormous tension thus assumed is given by the fol-

lowing simple calculation relating to a tree liiO feet high. Not only has the liquid to

be raised to this height, but in its passage upwards a resistance calculated to be equal

to about five times the height of the tree has to be overcome. Hence the tran-

spiration-force in such a tree must at least equal the weight of a column of water

720 feet in height ; that is, a pressure of about twenty-four atmospheres, or 360 lb. to
the square inch. But there is no evidence to prove that a tension of anvthino- like
twenty atmospheres exists, as a matter of fact, in a transpiring tree ; on|the con-

trary, such observations as exist (e.ff., those of Hales and of Boehm) indicate much

lower tensions. Under these circumstances we must regretfully confess that yet

one more century haa closed without bringing tlie solution of the seculai* pl'obleifl

of the ascent of the sap.

     The nineteenth century has been, fortunately, rather more fertile in discovery
concerning the movements and irritability of plants. But it is surprising how much

knowledge on these points had been accumulated by the beginning of the century

the facts of plant-movement, such as the curvatures due to the action of light, the

sleep-movements of leaves and flowers, the contact-movements of the leaves of the

sensitives, were all familiar. The nineteenth century opened, then, with a con-
sidnrable store of facts ; but what was lacking was an iuterpretation of them ; and
whilst it lias largely added to the store, its most important work has been done in

the direction of explanation.

The first event of importance was the discovery by Knight, in 1806, of the fact

that the stems and roots of plants are irritable to the action of gravity and respond

to it by assuming definite directions of growth. Many years later the term

' geotropism ' was introduced by Frank (1868) to designate the phenomena of

growth as aSected by gravity, and at the same time Frank announced the import-

ant discovery that dorsiventral members, such as leaves, behave quite differently

from radial members, such as stems and roots, in that they are diageotropic.

     It was a long time before the irritability of plants to the action of light was

recognised. Chiefly on the authority of de Candolle (to whom we owe the term

' heliotropistn '), heliotropic curvature was accounted for by assuming that the one
side received less light than the other, and therefore grew the more rapidly. But
the researches of Sachs (1873) and MUller-Thurgau (1876) have made it clear that

the direction of the incident rays is the important point, and that a radial stem,

obliquely illuminated, is stimulated to curve until its long axis coincides with the

incident rays. Moreover, the discovery by Knight (1812) of negative heliotropism

in the tendrils of Vitis and Ampelopsis really put the Candollean theory quite out
of court ; and further evidence that heliotropic movements are a response to the

stimulus of the incident rays of fight is afibrded by Fi-ank's discovery of the

diaheliotropism of dorsiventral members.

The question of the localisation of irritability has received a good deal of

attention. The fact that the under surface of the pulvinus of Mimosa pudica is
alone sensitive to contact was ascertained by Burnett and Mayo in 1827 ; and

shortly after (1834) Curtis discovered the sensitiveness of the hairs on the upper

surface of the leaf of Dioncea. After a long period of neglect the subject was

taken up by Darwin. The irritability of tendrils to contact had been discovered by

Mohl in  1827                          but it was Darwin who  ascertained,  in  1865, that  it is confined to
                                    ;

the concavity near the tip. In 1875 Darwin found that the irritability of the

tentacles of Drosera is localised in the terminal gland ; and followed this up, in 1880,

by asserting that the sensitiveness of the root is localised in the tip, which acts like

a brain. This assertion led to a great deal of controversy, but the researches of

Pfeffer and Czapek (1894) have finally established the correctness of Darwin's con-
clusion. It is interesting to recall that Erasmus Darwin had suggested the possible
existence of a brain in plants in his ' Phytologia ' (1800). But the word ' brain

is misleading, inasmuch as it might imply sensation and consciousness : it
would be more accurate to speak of centres of ganglionic activity. However,

the fact remains that there exist in plants irritable centres which not only

receive stimuli but transmit impulses to those parts by which the consequent

movement is efiected. The transmission of stimuli has been found in the case of

Mimosa pudica to be due to the propagation of a disturbance of hydrostatic

equilibrium along a special tissue ; in other cases, where the distance to be traversed
is small, it is probably effected by means of that continuity of the protoplasm to

which I have already alluded.

    Finally, as resrards the mechanism of these movements, we find SeniSbier and

Rudolphi, the earliest writers on the subject in the nineteenth century, asserting,

as if against some accepted view, that there is no structure in a plant comparable

with the muscle of an animal. Iludolphi (1807) suggested, as an alternative, that

the position of a mobile leaf is determined by the ' turgor vitalis' of the pulvinus,

and thus anticipated the modern theory of the mechanism. But he gives no
                                                                                             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                               929

explanation of what he means by ' turgor ; ' and the term is frequently used by

writers in the first half of the century in the same vague way. Some progress was

made in consequence of the discovery of osmosis by Dutrochet (1828), and more

especially by his observation (1837) that the movements of Mimosa are dependent

on the presence of oxygen, and are therefore vital. But it was not, and could not

be, until the existence of living protoplasm in the cells of plants was realised, and

the movements of free-swimming organisms and naked reproductive cells had

become more familiar, that the true nature of the mechanism began to be under-

stood                               and         then                                    we find Cohn saying, as long ago as 1860, that  ' the living
                                 ;

protoplasmic substance is the essentially contractile portion of the cell.' This state-

ment may, perhaps, seem to put the case too bluntly and to savour too much of

animal analogy                                                                          but the study of  the conditions of  turgidity has shown more and
                                                                                     ;

more clearly that the protoplasm is the predominant factor. The protoplasm of

plantr-cells is undoubtedly capable of rapid molecular changes, which alter its

physical properties, more particularly its permeability to the cell-sap. It may be

that these changes cannot be directly compared with those going on in animal

muscle ; but if we use the term ' contractility ' in its wider sense, as indicating a

general property of which muscular contraction is a special case, then Cohn's

statement is fully justified. This is borne out by the observations of Sir J. Burdon-

Sanderson (18S2-8S) on the electrical changes taking place in the stimulated leaf

o{ Dioncea, and by Kunkel's (1878) corresponding observations on Mimosa pudica:

in both cases the electrical changes were found to be essentially the same as those

observable on the stimulation of muscle. AVe find, then, that the advances in

Physiology, like those in Anatomy, teach the essential unity of life in all living

things, whether we call them animals or plants.

With this in our minds we may go on to consider in conclusion, and very

briefly, that department of physiological study which is known as the Bionomics

or (Ecology of plants. In the earlier part of the century this subject was studied

more especially with regard to the distribution of plants, and their relation to soil

and climate : but since the publication of the ' Origin of Species ' the purview has

been greatly extended. It then became necessary to study the relation of plants,

not only to inorganic conditions, but to each other and to animals ; in a word, to

study all the adaptations of the plant with reference to the struggle for existence.

The result has been the accumulation of a vast amount of most interesting infor-
mation. For instance, we are now fairly well acquainted with the adaptations of

water-plants (hydrophytes) on the one hand and of desert-plants (xerophytes) on

the other                                       with                                    the  adaptations of shade-plants and of those growing in   full sun,
                                             ;

Weespecially as regards the protection of the chlorophyll.                                                                   have learned a great

deal as to the relations of plants to each other, such as the peculiarities of parasites,

epiphytes, and climbing plants, and as to those singular symbioses (Mycorhiza) of

the higher plants with Fungi which have been found to be characteristic of sapro-

phytes. Then, again, as to the relations between plants and animals : the adaptation

of flowers to attract the visits of insects, first discovered by Spreugel (1793), has

been  widely                                    studied                                      the  protection  of the plant against the attacks of  animals,
                                                                                    ;

by means of thorns and spines on the surface, as also by the formation in its

tissues of poisonous or distasteful substances, and even by the hiring of an army

of mercenaries in the form of ants, has been elucidated ; and finally those cases

in which the plant turns the tables upon the animal, and captures and digests

him, are now fully understood.

                                                                                                          Conclusion.

     Imperfect as is the sketch which I have now completed, it will, I think, suiBce
to show how remarkable has been the progress of the science during the
nineteenth century, more particularly the latter part of it, and how multifarious

are the directions in which it has developed. In fact Botany can no longer be
regarded as a single science: it has grown and branched into a congeries of

sciences. And as we botanists regard with complacency the flourishing condition

honour to those whose lifework it was to make the way straight for us, and whose

conquests have become our peaceful possession ; nor, on the other, that it lies with

unproductive, or only slightly productive, suitable for growing a native supply of

timber, but owners and nation comfortably apathetic in the matter, content with

present abundant supply. Sportsmen are groundlessly fearful of their pleasures

being disturbed. It is really a national matter, calling for Government aid and

supervisioti, or good private ' working plans,' which cannot be disturbed by changes

of individual management.

treble and quadruple of ours. Natural conditions here not less favourable, but

management generally inferior.

4. The Great Smoke-Cloud of the North of England and its Influence on

                            Plants. By Albert Wilson.

The widespread eflect of smoke insufficiently realised. Dwellers in towns

often so hardened to it as to be almost oblivious of its presence. The great smoke-

producing district of the North of England ; its extent ; miserable condition of

vegetation in some parts of the area. Variation in amount of smoke according to

the season. Efl:ect in reducing air transparency, dimness of sky and landscape.
Distance to which smoke travels. Smoke often mistaken for haze. Red sunset*?

in South-east Yorkshire. Atmosphere of the North of England. North of the

smoke area never brilliant with southerly winds. The smoke from Barrow-in-

Furness, an isolated town ; long distance at which this is noticeable ; comparison
of its volume with that from the great smoke area. The characteristic smell from

certain large works, and the distance at which it can be detected. Discoloration

of rainwater ; ' black rain.' Influence of smoke on sunshine and air temperature

in calm summer weather, and in  anticyclonic weather                                                                                                               during  autumn  or  winter

mosses and hepatics as compared with that on higher plants. Smoke at a maximum
in winter, when many mosses are in a vegetative condition. Great diminution in

their abundance and luxuriousness in the neighbourhood of large towns. Peculiar

extinction of Ulota and OrtTwtricha.

        5. A Gymnosporanghi'm from China. By F. E. Weiss.

     This fungus was fii-st observed by Dr. A. G. Parrott in the spring of 1899 in
Lao-ho-kou, in North Central China (lat. 32° 50' N., long. 112* E.). Its spore
masses made their appearance in April on the branches of Junipertis chinensis in

the form of bright yellow gelatinous masses after a few days' continuous rain. The

teleutosp ore-beds appear singly or in clusters on the leaves of the smaller branches,

usually in more or less flat leaf-like masses. When close together they often

become confluent. The teleutospores are of the usual type, two-colled, tapering
towards both ends and somewhat rounded at the apex. They possess eight germ

pores.

What is in all probability the Rcestelia stage of this fungus was observed

Aduring the summer on the leaves of the pear, Pyvus sinensis, Ldl.    tree of this

species growing in proximity to the infected junipers was attacked by a fungus of

the Rcestelia type, producing typical secidiospores.

In the appearance of its teleutospore masses and in the shape and structure of

the teleutoa'porea this fungus appears most nearly related to Gymnosporangiuvi

SahincB (Dicks), a widely distributed form occurring in Europe and in America,
and to Gyinnof.porangium Cunninghamianum (Barclay), a Himalayan form, both

of which have their Roestelia stage on a pear, the former on Pyms communis, the

latter on Pyrus Pashia,

   6. Demonstration of the Structure and Attachment of the Flagelhim in

                      Euglena viridis. By Harold Wager.

     The flagellum of Euglena viridis possesses a bifurcate base, which is attached
to the wall of the excretory reservoir at the anterior end of the body.' As it

passes to the anterior, through the gullet, an enlargement occurs in the region of,
and partly surrounded by, the eye-spot. This structure can be seen in very favour-
able cases in the living condition, but usually only after the action of reagents.

The best reagent for this purpose is either a 1 per cent, solution of osmic acid or
a 2 per cent, solution of bichromate of potash with a 1 per cent, solution of osmic
acid. Good preparations have also been obtained by treating fresh cells with a

solution of iodine.

    The structure may be obscured by small grains of paramylon which sometimes

accumulate at the anterior end of the body.

                              Byl. W. WOODHEAD..

     Longitudinal sections show that the nodule is traversed by a central strand of
short, thick-walled, prosenchymatous fibres, with transverse pits in the walls.
Surrounding this are four or five layers of cubical cells, rich in protoplasm, followed

by a small-celled bulky cortex. On the outside of this is a phellogen, which pro-
duces a layer of cork several cells deep. The cortical cells are largely occupied

by the organism which produces the nodule. Their distribution is roughly in
parallel layers of cells passing obliquely from the central strand outwards ; between

these layers are cells filled with starch grains, often in various stages of dis-

organisation, embedded in a very granular protoplasm, much resembling bacteria.
     The organism is usually present as a globular sporangium at the end of a short

hypha : these bodies are densely packed within the cells ; their life-history, though
as yet obscure, presents several different phases. Towards the base of the nodule
are strands of cells occupied by disorganised contents indicating a previous tract of
growth of the organism : this is succeeded by groups of cells filled with the
organism in various stages. Towards the apex, and immediately behind the
growing point, the cells containing the sporangia are immediately followed by cells

tilled with fine hyphal filaments which may be seen to penetrate the walls of the

young adjacent cells.
     These observations, which are as yet in a preliminary stage, were made in the

Botanical Laboratory, Cambridge, through the kindness of Professor H. Marshall

Ward, to whom I am greatly indebted for much help and encouragement.

8. Fungi found in Ceylon growing upon Scale-insects (Coccidas and
  Aleurodidse).^ By J. Parkin, M.A., Trinity College, Cambridge.

The author's attention was called to these fungi by Mr. E. E. Green, Entomo-

logist to the Government of Ceylon. The greater part of the specimens was

Asupplied by him.    few examples were collected by the author.
AFungi associated with scale-insects have till recently been little studied.

few species have been mentioned from time to time as growing upon scales of dead

coccids, but, till within the last few years, hardly any attention has been called to

their probable parasitic character or to the capability of their being employed to

check the ravages of scale-pests. Webber - in 1807 points out for the first time

-- --the parasitic habit of certain species five in all of Aschersonia on scale-insects

infesting the orange and other plants in Florida. Zimmermann ^ in the following

year in Java gives a preliminary account oi a. i\xi\o;us {Cephalosporium) attacking

the green bug {Lecanium viride), so harmful to the coflee, and describes how_ it

may be artificially cultivated for infecting experiments. Green is also conducting

such experiments in Ceylon.

    The various kinds here brought to notice are referable to the following genera :

Pyrenomycetes-Hypocreales : Nectria, Torrubiflla.

Fungi imperfect!: Aschersonia, Cephalospormm, Verticillium, Microcera,

Campsotrichum (?).
     Nectria.--The conidial stage belongs to the Fusarvnn type, with large multi-

septate curved conidia. Two distinct species are perliaps recognisable. One has

been found on several occasions growing on scale-insects, belonging to three

genera of the tribe Diaspidinae. It may perhaps be identical with N. aurantiicola,

B. and Br.,* which is mentioned incidentally as growing apparently from some

coccus on orange twigs. The other was found on a scale {Asterolecanium miliaris)

infesting a bamboo.

    The only allusions to this habitat for Nectrla that the author has found, besides
the above one, are two:^ regarding Bra2ilian .species {N. coccorMm, Speg., and

--JS'. coccogena, Speg.), both described as growing on dead cocci on leaves.
     Torrubiella. This genus, with thread-like ascospores, consists so far of only

   three species: one of these, T. rubra, Pat. and Lagerh,,' is described as growing
   on a coccus. The Ceylon forms, two iu numher, agree fairly closely with the
   description of T. rubra. One, with deep pink perithecia, was found on a species of
   Aleurodes, the other, with pale brown perithecia, on a species of Aspidiotus.

      --Aschersonia, This genus, chiefly tropical, and consisting now of about nineteen

   species, has usually been taken to be a leaf-infesting one. Webber - has shown
   that it may also be entomogenous. It is quite possible that species hitherto

   regarded as growing on leaves and stems are in reality parasitic on scale-insects
   occurring on these parts of plants. The Ceylon forms have been formed on species

   of Aleurode-i and Lecanium.
        Along with one of these Aschersonias on the same kind of scale are flattened

   circular brown fungous pustules, which are similar in structure to what Webber
   names as the * brown mealy-wing fungus.' ^ In neither case has any trace of

   --spore-formation been found.
        Cephalosporium. The fungus referred to previously as found by Zimmermann
   on the green bug has been named by him provisionally as Cephalosporium Lecanii,

   Specimens practically identical with this have been obtained in Ceylon on the

   --same scale on the cotfee and other plants, also on two other species of Lecanium.
         Vertidllium. The species V. heterocladium* described by Penzig as occurring
   on the dead bodies of Lecanium hesperidum on leaves of the lemon, is the single
   instance found of such a habitat for this genus. The Ceylon member was dis-
   covered on the same scale and on the same bamboo as possessed the Nectria,

   mentioned above. As a rule the Nectria was confined to the upper and the
   Vertidllium to the lower surface of the leaves. Possibly the two may be

   connected.

      --Microcera. This genus, closely related to Fusarium, was established by

   Desmazieres ^ in 1848 for a fungus {M. coccophila) discovered on a scale-insect.
   Later it was shown to be the conidial stage of SphcBrostilbe coccophila.'' Another

   species, M. rectispora, Cooke and Mass.,^ has been found associated with a coccus
   on the orange in Australia. The Ceylon types occur on three genera of the
   Diaspidinse. One of them is probably the conidial stage of a Calonectria.

      --Campsotrichum. The fungus referred to this genus was discovered growing

   on a scale {Chionasjns Aspidistra) on a palm. It has not yet received a very close

   examination, but seems to agree best with this genus of the group Dematiacese
   of the Fungi imperfecti.

        Mr. Green has also passed on to the author specimens of this class of fungi
   received from other countvies,y\z., Aschersonia from India, Sumatra, and Java, and
   Microcera from West Africa and Mauritius.

        Thus it seems that fungi infesting scale-insects have an extensive distribution,
   especially in and near the tropics. That they are the true cause of the death of

   the insects there seems little doubt.

       3. Formation of Starch from Glycollie Aldehyde by Green Plants.
                           By Heney Jackson, B.A., B.Sc.

      Glycollic aldehyde or diose has recently been isolated in a crystalline state,^

and more recently it has been shown by the author - that this substance, under the
influence of dilute alkalis, very quickly condenses to two synthetic hexoaes, one of
which, and acrose, is identical with fructose

It therefore became a matter of interest to find whether green plants could build
up starch if allowed to remain for a time in a solution of this simple sugar. The
following are the results of a few experiments. Leaves of tropceolum and clover,
which had been depleted of their starch by growing in the dark, were floated in a
3 per cent, aqueous solution of diose, control experiments being made with cane
sugar, glycerine, and distilled water ; the whole series being kept in the dark for
six days. They were then tested by Sachs's method, and it was found that those
floating in pure water were quite starchless, those in glycerine almost so, but those
growing in diose had accumulated starch in the tissues, though not to the same
extent as those placed in cane sugar.

      Spirogyra was placed in a 1 per cent, solution of diose in an atmosphere free
from COo, and after five days in the light had accumulated starch, whilst the
control experiment in distilled water showed only a small quantity of starch. In
the last set of experiments spirogyra was grown in an atmosphere free from 00,^,
but kept in the dark. After a week the control specimen, which bad been in dis-
tilled water, was starchless, whilst that growing in the sugar had formed large

quantities of starch.

   4. On the Effect of Salts on the CO^ Assimilation of Ulva latissima, L.
                           By E. A. Newell Arber, B.A.

     The primary object of these experiments was to obtain a general idea of the
extent to which the power of CO., assimilation is dependent on the absorption of

nutrient salts.

     It was found that an inhibition of the CO., assimilation could be caused by the
presence or absence of certain salts in the medium.

      Ulva was rendered free from starch, and exposed to light in media containing
known proportions of salts. The amount of CO^ assimilation which took place
was gauged by the starch accumulation. In distilled water only a very small
amount of starch was formed, while in tap-water containing traces of nutrient
salts the inhibition was only slight. Distilled water was not found to have any

                          _

injurious effect on the plant. The presence of NaCl in the medium was found to
be essential in order to obtain the maximum of CO^ assimilation. From indirect
evidence a total or almost total absence of NaCl caused a very marked inhibition
in all cases ; and no other salt could be found to replace NaCl in regard to CO3

assimilation.

     The absence of any one of the following salts, MgCl.j, MgSO^, CaS04,or KCl,from
sea water did not inhibit the assimilation. The presence of a nitrate in appreciable

quantity in the medium caused an inhibition. Ammonium nitrate was found to
be fatal. KNO3 caused a more marked inhibition than NaNOa; the inhibition

being least marked in the case of Mg(NOJ,,.

5. The Sea-weed Ulva latissima and its Relation to the Pollution of Sea-

    water by Sewage. By Professor Letts, D.Sc, Ph.D., and John

    Hawthorne, B.A., Qiieen's College, Belfast.

For a numter of years past a very serious nuisance has arisen from the sloblands

of the upper reaches of Belfast Lough during the summer months, the stench at

low tide being quite overpowering, and the air heavily charged with sulphuretted

Ahydrogen.  precisely similar nuisance, though not of the same magnitude, also

arises from the sloblands in the northern portion of Dublin Bay.

     The nuisance is caused by deposits of the green sea-weed, called Ulva latissima,
or sea-lettuce, which in the two localities mentioned grows in abundance, and
during high winds or gales is washed ashore. In Belfast Lough the quantity thus
deposited is enormous, forming hanks which are often several feet thick, and
extend for miles along the coast. Once deposited, these layers of sea-weed often
remain more or less stationary for months in the shallow bays or pools of the

neighbourhood, and in warm weather rapid putrefaction occurs, and a perfectly

intolerable stench arises, which is perceptible over a wide area, and seriously affects

not only the comfort of the inhabitants of the district, but the value of their

property also.

     The Che7>iical Changes which occur when Ulva latissima ferments in Sea-

--water. An extended investigation in the laboratory has shown that when the

sea-weed ferments hydrogen and carbonic anhydride are first evolved in about
equal proportions by volume, and fatty acids are produced. Isolation and exami-

nation of these latter show that propionic acid is the chief; butyric acid is a,l80
formed, and probably acetic acid in addition. In a later stage of the fermentation
sulphides are formed, probably by reduction of sulphates present in the sea-water,
and the sea-weed blackens from formation of ferrous sulphide, and this latter
disengages sulphuretted hydrogen by the action of the fatty acids, whence the

nuisance.

   --Composition of Ulva latissima. The mean results of the analysis of the dried

sea-weed were as follows :

Carbon .    35-15
Hydrogen      5-27
Nitrogen      6-25
Oxygen
Ash .       ?n^15-37 con4.tam·mg r Sulphur 3-21
                    | j^.^^             2-20

            10000

      Attempts to isolate any definite principles by the methods of proximate
analysis were not very successful, and no carbohydrate beyond cellulose could be

 identified.

   --Bacteriological JExamination. Considerable difficulty was experienced in

attempts to isolate the organisms concerned in the putrefactive processes, and the
ordinary methods failed for the greater part. The evidence at present collected

Apoints to there being two chief species concerned. (1) spore-forming bacillus

which apparently infests the sea- weed and causes the production of fatty acids from
its tissues ; and (2) a second micro-organism, probably derived from the mud^ of
the shore, which gives rise to the formation of sulphides by a later fermentative

process.

   --Ulva latissima in Relation to Setvage Pollution. The evidence tending to

prove that the occurrence of the sea-weed in quantity in any locality is associated
with sewage pollution is of three kinds.

  --(1) The Composition of its Tissues. The amount of nitrogen it contains is far

in excess of that of any other sea-weed of which analyses are recorded. It contains
over 6 per cent., and resembles in nitrogen content an animal product rather
than a vegetable. (Dry cheese contains about 7, and dry milk about 5 per cent.,

whereas peas only contain about 4 and meadow hay 2 per cent.)
           936 REPORT--1900.

           --A(2) Assimilation Experiments.  frond of tlie sea-weed was placed in various

           mixtures in succession (a) of polluted sea-water, (b) polluted sea-water plus

           sewage, (c) polluted sea-water with sewage and ammonium salt, (d) sea-water

           plus nitrates. By determinations of free and albuminoid ammonia, and nitrates in

           these mixtures hefore and after the sea- weed had been in contact with them, the

           power of assimilating nitrogen which the weed possesses was ascertained and was

           found to be remarkably high. Thus in one experiment it absorbed the whole of

           the free ammonia from a polluted sea-water containing O'OSO part per lOO'OOO in

           seventeen hours. Nitrates were also rapidly absorbed, but not albuminoid

           matters. The weed remained in perfect health during these experiments and is

           still growing, although nine months have elapsed since the experiments were

           commenced.

             --(.3) The Localities ivhere Ulva latissima abounds, and from which it is

           virtually absent. As stated above the sea-weed is present in abundance in Belfast

           Lough, but it is almost entirely absent from Strangford Lough, which is similar

           in area and in many other respects to Belfast Lough, but differs from it in not
           being extensively polluted by sewage. In Dublin Bay the sea-weed is found in

           quantity in the harbour, which is highly polluted, but not in the southern parts of

           --the bay, which receive no sewage except near Kingstown, where a large sewage

           tank discharges on the ebb tide. There the weed occurs.
                The evidence which the authors have collected tends tlierefore to the conclu-

           sion that the occurrence of Viva latissima in quantity in a given locality is an
           indication of sewage contamination, and there can be no doubt as to the power

           which the weed possesses of absorbing nitrogen compounds from polluted sea-
           water. AVbile thus acting as scavenger it may itself give rise to a very extensive

           nuisance.

                                          By Ethel N. Thomas.

                This research was undertaken at Miss Sargant's suggestion, because of tbe
           extreme importance of the discovery of double fertilisation in Monocotyledons
           by Professor Nawascbin and later by Professor Guignard.

                The work was carried out at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington,
           and among other plants Professor Farmer recommended Caltha palustris.

The polar nuclei of this plant unite before fertilisation, but that there is no

absolutely fixed period is shown by the very difiFerent appearance of sacs in which

polar fusion is taking place.

The male generative nuclei, when first set free in the embryo sac, are extremely

small and heavily stained. Their chromatic substance is so densely aggregated as

--to render the spermatozoid to all appearance homogeneous.
     Of the two spermatozoids one I believe that which leaves the pollen tube
--first
         passes  to  the middle  of  the  sac  and there  fertilises  the  definitive  nucleus                                the
                                                                                                                           ;

other fertilises the nucleus of the oosphere.

By the time the male generative nucleus or spermatozoid has reached the

definitive nucleus, it has enlarged immensely, and shows a light spongy structure

with scattered chromatin granules. The other spermatozoid, however, increases

very little in size, and always remains dark and dense.

    When the .spermatozoids leave the pollen tube they are somewhat short and

thick, and only slightly curved, but when the one has approached the definitive

nucleus, it has the typical vermiform shape, with one or several coils.

Professor Nawaschiu has recently published an account of double fertilisation

in JJelphinium and in two Composites.

       2. The Conducting Tissues of Bryophytes. By A. G. Tansley.

     The most important part of our present knowledge of these tissues is due to
Haberlandt,' who, in the Poly trichacese, distinguished a hadrom (hydroon) or water-
conducting system from a leptom, conducting plastic, especially nitrogenous, sub-
stances. In the lower mosses, only the hydrom is differentiated, and in the
xerophilous and hydrophilous forms, in which water is taken in at any part of

the surface, even this is absent. Localisation of the region of absorption is the

condition on which the evolution of a hydrom depends.
     In the present investigation the lignified strand of proseuchyma in the midst of

the thallus of certain Liverworts {Pallamcinia.Symphyoyyna and Hymenophytoti)
was shown to be a hydrom strand, and its development to be correlated to some
extent with the localisation of the absorptive region of the thallus.

     The rhizome of four species of Po(y^nc^2<7?i was investigated, and in every case
was found to possess with striking completeness the distribution of tissues
characteristic of the root of a vascular plant. The transition to the structure of
the aerial stem was followed, and while the account of the structure of the latter
given by previous observers was confirmed in most particulars, some new points in
the structure and course of the leaf-traces were observed, and new light was, it is
hoped, thrown on the constitution of the Polytrichaceous stele, which is thought to
consist of two regions, primitively distinct in function and by descent. Finally,
an attempt has been made to trace out the course of evolution of these conducting
tissues in the Bryophytic series.

  3. On a Fourth Type of Transition from Stem to Root- structure occur
    ring in certain Monocotyledonous Seedlings. By Ethel Sargant.

     The three types of transition from a stem to a root-structure described by
Professor Ph. van Tieghem (' Traite de Botanique,' 12me edition, 1891, p. 782) are

briefly as follows :

     1. As the n bundles of the hypocotyledonary stele descend mto the primary
root, the xylem of each bundle branches to right and left at the same time that
the protoxylem elements become external. The right-hand branch from each
bundle unites with the left-hand branch of the adjacent one, so that we still have
n xylem groups in the root-stele. The n phloem groups descend in a straight

line without branching or rotation.

                         ----

938 REPORT--1900.

     2. There are 2n bundles in the hypocotyl. As they descend into the root each
bundle rotates on its axis in such a way that the phloem groups are able to unite
in pairs. The xylem groups also unite in pairs, the protoxylem elements becoming
external as they do so. Thus there are n phloem and n xylem groups in the

root-stele.

     3. There are n bundles in the hypocotyl as in type 1, but in this case each of
the phloem groups divides into two without rotation. The branches from adja-

cent bundles unite in pairs, so that we still have n phloem groups in the stele.

Meanwhile each of the xylem groups has rotated on its axis without branching.
Thus the n xylem groups are all external.

      It is clear that type 3 is the converse of type 1.

    Among the monocotyledonous seedlings which I have examined I find a

fourth type of transition, which is the converse of type 2. The best example is
Anemarrhena aspkodeloides, but there are very clear traces of the same structure
in the allied genera Asphodelus and Asphodeline.

     The type may he thus defined :
     4. There are n bundles in the hypocotyl. As they descend into the primary
rc^ot the phloem of each divides into two groups without rotation or subsequent
fusion. Thus there are 2n phloem groups in the root-stele. The xylem of each

bundle branches in two or more directions, while the protoxylem elements become
external. If more than 2n xylem groups have been thus formed, adjacent groups
fuse in pairs, so that only 2n xylem groups enter the root-stele.

     In Anemarrhena asphodeloides there are two bundles in the cotyledon which
pass downwards through the hypocotyl into the primary root. Daring the trans-
ition each phloem group divides into two. Each xylem group branches in three
directions. It sends a group of protoxylem elements to divide its own two phloem

groups from each other. This we may call the median protoxylem group. Two

lateral protoxylem groups are also formed from the xylem of each bundle in the
space dividing the bundles from each other. The four lateral protoxylem groups
thus formed are reduced to two by the fusion of adjacent groups in pairs. In the
end there are four phloem groups and four protoxylem groups in the root-stele.

4. The Origin of Modern Cycads. By W. C. Worsdell, F.L.S.

The subject is treated from the aspect of the vegetative structure.

An exhaustive study of the vegetative characters enables one to draw theo-

retical conclusions as to the origin of modern Cycads.

This conclusion is that the latter have descended directly from some Cycado-

filicinean type possessing the structure exhibited especially by such forms as the

Medullosa3 and Lyginodendrese, the chief point being that the collaterally con-

structed one or more vascular cylinders of modern Cycads have been derived from

one or more concentrically constructed cylinders of some Cycado-filicinean form.

Those characters in the modern plants which approximate most nearly to the

primitive ancestral type are found in those parts of the plant where they would

most naturally be expected, viz. :

Of ai'za^ organs : the 2)rimary node or transitional region between stem and

root, and the Jlotvering  axis                     of foliar organs :  the  cotyledon, the  spoi'ophyll, and
                                                ;

the integument of the sporangium.

In the axial organs or stems of modern Cycads the vascular tissue consists of,

in five genera, a single cylinder ; in the four remaining genera, of inore than one or

several cylinders. These cylinders are collateral in structure.

In the region of the primary node, however, the structure of the one or more

outer cylinders exhibits a variation in that it approximates to the concentric type,

either by the appearance of an inversely-orientated zone attached to the inner face

of each cylinder, or by the breaking up of the cylinder into a number of concentric

or partially concentric independent strands.

The first of these two types of primary nodal structure is normally charac-

teristic of Medullosa porosa, the second of Medullosa Solmsii.
                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                                                                  939

In the peduncle of the male cone of Stangeria the single cylinder consists in

its lower portion of bundles which, by their irregularly curved, sub-concentric, or

sometimes perfectly concentric contour, betray their derivation from a cylinder of

concentric strands like that of Medullosa Sohnsii.

The primitive vascular bundle of the foliar organs from which that in all the

various foliar organs of modern Cycads has been derived is, on the view here set

forth, held to be the type exhibited by the leaf of Lyginodendron (Eachiopteris)

it consists of a central mass of primary tracheides with several protoxylem-groups

at the periphery, the whole being surrounded by phloem.

In Xhe foliage-leaves of modern Cycads the concentric bundle becomes broken

up into great numbers of collateral bundles, each with a conspicuous mass of

centripetal primary tracheides. This very same character obtains in the foliage-

leaves of all species of Medullosa.

In the cotyledons, sporojjhylls, and sporangial integuments of recent Cycads

many of the bundles exhibit the primitive concentric type of structure, with the

modification that in the cotyledon of Stangeria, the reduction in size of the

bundle, in the sporophyll, as in Encephalortos, the development of the secondary

centrifugal xylem has caused the disappearance of the central primary xylem ; a
modification which has also supervened in the case of the vascular strands of the

stem. Hence the vascular structure of iha foliage-leaves of the Medullosea is more

advanced and modified than is that of the cotyledons and sporophylls of recent

Cycads, and a fortiori than that of the foliage-leaf of Lyginodendron.

The central cylinder of the stem of Lyginodendron Oldhamium has the same

origin as that of modern Cycads, as is shown (1) by the curved contour of the

various strands composing it, betraying the origin of each l^-om a concentric strand;

and (2) by the occurrence of inversely-orientated vascular tissue on the inner side
of the cylinder, abnormally in L. Oldhamium and normally in L. rohustum.

The single stele of Heterancjium is, homologous with each single concentric stele

once, on this view, composing the cylinder oi Lyginodendron, a,s with each such

stele in Medullosa Solmsii and M. avglica.

     Three stages of advancement are, therefore, to be noted in the vascular struc-

ture of this great phylum :--

The Filices possess a vascular system in essentials wholly concentric ; in the

Cycado-jilices the  collateral character first makes its  appearance                                                        in  Cycads the
                                                                                                                         ;

collateral strongly predominates, while the concentric has almost died out.

      5. On tlie Structure of the Stem of Angiopteris evecta, Hoffm.
                  By R. F. Shove, Girton College, Cambridge.

     This paper deals with the anatomy of the stem and roots of a plant of
Angiopteris evecta from Ceylon. The older part of the obliquely ascending axis

exhibits a distinct dorsiventrality and gives off numerous roots from the lower
surface ; in the younger part of the stem the structure becomes more radial and

the roots are much less abundant.
     The mode of origin of the leaf-traces and their connection with the stelar frame-

work in the stem, which has the form of a series of inverted funnel-shaped zones, is
worked out in detail, the result in a few points differing somewhat from those
obtained by Mettenius.

     The steles of the stem are both mesarch and endarch in structure, but the
protoxylem groups occupy for the most part a peripheral position. The earliest
protoxylem appears along the inner edge of the steles, while the protnphloem arises
on the outer edge of each stele as a discontinuous arc of small and rather thick-
walled elements. This arc of protophloem is never completed round the stele, but
the next stage in the development of the tissues after the appearance of the pro-
toxylem is the differentiation of large sieve-tubes external to the protophloem.

     Air-roots and earth-roots were anatomically investigated, and the origin of the
latter was traced from the vascular lattice-work of the stem. Several initial cells
were recognised in the apical region of the stem.

            2. Further Investigations on the Intumescences of Hibiscus

                    vitifolius {Linn.). By Elizabeth Dale.

     The author previously examined the structure of certain intumescences (out-
growths) on the green parts of Hibiscus vitifolius, and made some preliminary
experiments which pointed to the conclusion that the conditions determining the
formation of outgrowths were moisture, warmth, and light.'

     During the present summer (1900) the experiments have heen extended. The
effects of moist air and moist sod were tested, and plants were also grown under
glass of various colours, in bright sunlight, in shade, and under whitewashed
glass at different temperatures. The following results were obtained. In a
moist atmosphere, bright sunlight, and a high temperature, large numbers of
intumescences were formed in two or three days. The most striking results were
obtained by isolating a single normal branch (still attached to the plant) in a
hell-jar containing damp air, and exposed to direct sunlight, in very hot weather.

     Outgrowths were also formed under red, yellow, and whitewashed glass, but
not under blue or green» glass, nor on plants grown in the open air. The distri-
bution of the outgrowths is dependent upon that of the stomata, both in Hibiscus
and also in other plants. There is no doubt that the checking of transpiration

(which is very active in this plant) by a damp atmosphere is one cause of the

development of outgrowths ; but this by itself is not sufficient, as the experiments
under blue and green glass show. It is necessary that assimilation also be active.
There is further evidence (partly furnished by the plants grown under coloured
glass) that an altered course of metabolism is also involved; a conclusion to which
the abnormally abundant development of oil also points. It seems clear that what
occurs is (1) a lack of salts owing to the arrested transpiration (2) the assimilated

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

carbohydrates are therefore being employed in metabolism with a deficiency of
nitrates; and (3) the tissues blocked with water are not respiring normally. That
the abnormal outgrowths and accumulation of oil are indications of the disturbed
metabolism is not surprising.

     The formation of outgrowths often begins round the teeth of the leaf. The
structure of the bundle-endings in the teeth of a normal leaf is that which
characterises water-glands ; and this fact, taken in connection with the position

and structure of the intumescences, suggests that they may be organs for the

excretion of water.

  3. On the Osmotic Properties and their Causes in the Living Plant and
                   Animal Cell. By Professor E. F. Overton.

   A very great number of experiments on the permeability of the living proto-

plasm of plant and animal cells has led to the conclusion that the general osmotic
properties of the cell depend on a phenomenon of elective solubility, certain layers
of protoplasm being impregnated with a mixture of lecithin and cholesterin. All
substances that are soluble in this mixture, and they include by far the greater
number of organic compounds, are able to penetrate into the living cell. The
rapidity of the passage of different compounds into the cell depends on their rela-

         4. The Biology and Cytology of a New Species of Pythium,
                             By Professor A. H. Trow.

     1. The reproductive organs of this fungus, ' conidia ' and oospores, were found
in rotten cress seedlings in July 1899, and the species has been cultivated as a
saprophyte on sterilised potatoes, house-flies, cabbage leaves, &c., up to the
present time (September 1900).

     2. The species appears to be a pure saprophyte, all attempts to infect fresh
cress seedlings having hitherto failed.

     ·3. Pure cultures were obtained by infecting sterilised potatoes with materials
obtained from cultures on rhubarb leaves.

    4. On potatoes an aerial mycelium is freely developed, which remains sterile

for weeks. Conidia and oospores ultimately develop in numbers, their presence
being readily recognised by their yellow colour.

    5. On house-flies or bits of cabbage leaves immersed in water the mycelium is

aquatic, and, as a rule, that developed on house-flies produces conidia, that on
cabbage leaves oospores.

     6. The life history has been carefully followed under the microscope in moist-
chamber cultures. It is noteworthy

     (a) That De Bary erred in including the greater portion of the periplasm in

the oosphere.

     (6) That there is no sharp line of differentiation between periplasm and
gonoplasm in the antheridium.

     (c) That most of the periplasm is absorbed by the young oospore, which in
consequence increases in size.

     {d) That the conidia and oospores on germination invariably produce germ
tubes, no zoospores being formed under any circumstances.

     (e) That the conidia germinate at once in a decoction of cabbage leaves, but
remain at rest in distilled water ; that the oospores germinate at once, as soon as
ripe, or after a rest of as much as seven months.

     7. The species is consequently new and rants as the most highly developed of

the genus.

     8. The mycelium ' conidia,' oogonia, and antheridia are multinucleate, the
oosphere is uninucleate, the young oospore binucleate, and the ripe oospore uninu-

cleate.

     9. The nuclei multiply by indirect division in the mycelium and sexual organs.

No nuclear changes of importance take place in the ' conidia.' The only nuclear

fusion is that of the male and female nuclei in fertilisation. The number of
chromosomes is considerable, certainly more than six.

     10. The oogonium, as it is formed, receives fifteen or more nuclei, the
antheridium three or more. These invariably divide once, so that the number of
nuclei is doubled. The supernumerary nuclei in the oogonium lie in the periplasm,

the female nucleus passes to and occupies the centre of the oosphere. No similar

distribution of the nuclei takes place in the antheridium.

     11. The fertilisation tube penetrates the wall of the oogonium at a spot pre-
pared for it, passes through the periplasm, and penetrates deeply into the ecrg.
One male nucleus passes down the tube and enters the egg. The oosphere clothes
itself with a delicate cell-wall and increases in size.

     12. The fusion of the male and female nuclei is delayed until a thick oospore

wall has developed. No epispore is formed.

followed. In the conidia nuclear divisions occur as germination proceeds"

vacuole is formed in the discharging process, probably containing a cellulose-
alterino- enzyme and some chemiotactic substance whose function it is to draw out
the protoplasm from the sporange into the spore vesicle. The ripe sporange also
contains a motile vacuole which discharges to the exterior just before the escape
of the protoplasm. Septa are formed in all species. Pythium represents a stage
in the colonisation of the land by saprolegniaceous ancestors resembling Aphano-
myces. It is closely linked to the Peronosporacese through P. intermedium,
whieb possesses chains of gonidia, suckers, and a thick-walled resting mycelium.

7. On the Azygospores of Entonioplithora gloeospora.
               By Professor P. Vuillemin.

The genus EntomopMliora, as seen in the two species E. Delpiniana and E. gloeo-
spora shows an intermediate condition between Sasidiobolus, with its uninucleatod

segments, and Empusa, with  its  continuous hyph;c   with  scattered   nuclei                           for  lu
                                                                                                     ;
mEntomophthora the nuclei are large, and arranged at regular intervals a single
row This state of things had led me to regard the non-septate condition as
arising from the failure to develop septa for the delimitation of the cytoplasmic
areas of the individual nuclei resulting from the division of a parent nucleus, and
to describe the condition as ' apocytial,' and the multinucleate mass of protoplasm

so formed as an ' apocyte ' or ' apocytium.' An exammation of the restmg-spores

alone found in Entomophthora has revealed the following history of their formation.
They may be terminal, lateral, or intercalary, and in the limbs of Mycetophila tbese

spores may be found of all ages, and arranged in basipetal succession of age, as
shown by the increasing thickening of the wall from O'/o^ to 4,x, or even b-b^i.
The youngest spores contain a single nucleus, which undergoes a series of four
successive binary divisions until there are 16 ; however, there may be irregulr.rities

so that the number may fall as low as 12, and in one case I have counted

as many as 17. In the next stage the nuclei approach so as to form eight pairs,

and the two nuclei of each pair then fuse : this fusion is repeated until at length
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  943

there are only two left. These last two may then fuse at once, so a8 to leave the
now maturing zygospore with a single nucleus, or they may remain apart. The

last stages of maturation are accompanied by the appearance of oil drops in the
cytoplasm, which fuse towards its centre into a single large drop, reducing the
protoplasmic contents of the spore to a peripheral envelope, with one or two

parietal nuclei, as the case may be.

     I can only interpret this formation as a case of true apogamy, and attribute
to the process a value corresponding with the sexual process of Basidiobohis, since
they both have tha same starting-point, the same intermediate stage of nuclear

division, and the same final nuclear fusion.

                                   By R. H. BiFFEN.

     Loose brown masses of the spores of this fungus are occasionally found in
Spanish chestnuts. These spores are developed from the apices of hyphae coiled
into a spiral of, at the most, two turns, which becomes septate into three cells
the cell next below the apical one swells and becomes thick-walled, thus forming
a chlamydospore. The coiled hypha may also develop into a spiral resembling
the ascogonium of Eurothim, which, after investment by branches arising from
its apex, breaks down into chlamydospores. In this way bodies very suggestive
of the spore-masses of some of the ustilaginese are formed. Endoconidia are found
in old cultures. Some evidence has also been obtained for the existence of an

ascigerous stage.

                           TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 11.

     The following Papers were read :

      1. Embryonic Tissues. By Professor Marshall Ward, F.R.S.

    I would submit for discussion whether we could not improve our terminology

and teaching regarding the natiu-e and growth of the tissues termed embryonic.

As is well known, Sachs and those whom he has influenced term all the tissues

of the growing points, cambium, pericycle, &c , embryonic tissues; but I want to
point out that this term in its simple form should be reserved for the embryo alone.
Only while the embryo consists of a few cells can we regard these cells as

embryonic tissues in the sense that all are nearly alike; at a later stage the
tissues of the growing points of stem and root have been derived from this
embryonic tissue, and in any case differ normally from it in that instead of being
capable of developing all or any parts of the plant, they are more and more
restricted to the power of developing only shoots, leaves, &c., or only roots. Still

more limited is the power of the cambium : it is normally confined to developing

--new xylem and phloem not even new organs-- and similarly vnih. other so-called

embryonic tissues of subsequent derivation. In view of such facts, and of other;j

which we can all supply, I would suggest that we restrict the i^xra. embryonic tissue,

or primary embryonic tissue, to that of the embryo only, before the desmogeu
strands are laid down, and speak of all other tissues as derived or secondary tissues.

--Thus the derived tissues of the growing points capable of initiating organs as well
--as tissues might be termed secondary embryonic tissue, and the cambium, &c.,

restricted embryonic tissues.
     The fact that such tissues retain sufficient of their primary properties to

develop whole organs, shoots, roots, &c., under modified or abnormal conditions
does not invalidate the distinctions referred to, and further classification and sub-
divisions along these lines could be made to meet the nt'cessities of such cases as

desmoyen (capable of laying down proto-xylem, &c.) and cambimn (capable of
--944 REPORT 1900.

forming secondary xylem and phloem only),wluch seem to me still too vaguely de-

fined in our text-books.

mySuch a classification would also apply to lower organisms. Indeed,       atten-

tion was first drawn to the matter by the observation that some algae and schizo-

mycetes appear to be always in the embryonic stage.

    This brings us to a second point. Attention is now always drawn to the

differences between the slow dimensional growth of the so-called embryonic tissues

of the gTOwing points and the stretching phase which Sachs called to our notice.

But it seems to me we ought to recognise that we have two fundamentally

different things here. It is, I thinlc, hopeless to restrict the meaning of the word

' growth "(as understood by botanists) only to that mode of dimensional increase by the

intersusception of solid particles in the non-vacuolated protoplasm of the true

embryonic tissue of an embryo, and which implies a real gain in substance by the

-- --assimilation in the sense of the word employed by animal physiologists of food-

materials. Yet this is real growth. The word 'growth,' as understood by botanists,

refers almost exclusively to the possibly totally different dimensional increase

implied in the extension of cells under pressure of vacuoles, and, taking into

account the respiratory activity which prevails, is attended by loss of substance.

    I would therefore suggest that we should distinguish the assimilatonj (jroivtho?

true embryonic tissue from the vacuolar groivth of the. i.e,T:\vQA tissues. This can

easily be done now that we are beginning to discard the misleading phrase ' carbon

dioxide assimilation ' in favour of some such term as ' photo-synthesis."

Here, again, clearness is, I think, attained by the change in the consideration of

those algaa and schizophytes in which no vacuoles can be detected. It would be

absurd to say they do not grow ; but it seems pretty clear that they grow by
assimilatory groxoth and not by vacuolar (/rowth or extension. At the same

time we must not forget that invisible vacuoles may exist in the meshes of proto-
plasm, though even if this be so it is difficult to see how the protoplasm in the

trabeculse between grows if not by the intercalation of solid molecular units.

2. The Behaviour of the Nucleolus during Karyokinesis in the Root

                Apex of Phaseolus. By Harold Wager,

    From a study of the changes undergone by the nucleolus during karyokinesis

In cells of the root apex of Phaseolus multiflorus the following chief results have

been obtained.

     1. The nucleolus is the most conspicuous object in the nucleus of the young
meristematic cells. The nuclear network forms a delicate peripheral layer only

in the resting nucleus.

2.  The nucleolus      stains  deeply in hasmatoxyhn, the  nuclear  network slightly
                                                                                                                                                   ;

in safranin and gentian violet the nucleolus stains red, the nuclear network light

blue ; in gentian violet the nucleolus often shows a more deeply stained central

portion.

3. In the resting condition of the nucleus the nucleolus is suspended to the

delicate nuclear network by delicate filaments.

4. The nucleolus often shows a vacuolar structure, especially in the stage just

previous to division.

     6. In the process of nuclear division the nucleolus first of all becomes irregular
in shape, and the nucleolar substance appears to pass, by means of the connecting
strands, into the nuclear network, which thereby becomes more prominent.

    6. As the chromosomes are formed the nucleolus disappears, but a portion of

the nucleolus is often visible in the equatorial plate.

     7. The chromatic substance of the chromosomes appears to be derived almost
entirely from the nucleolus, but a part of the nucleolus may possibly be used up in

the formation of the spindle fibres.

    8. As the daughter nuclei are being formed the chromatic substance of the

chromosomes runs together into small spheres, which ultimately fuse together to
form the single large nucleolus.

   3i On the Presence of Seed-like Organs in certain Palceozoic Lycopods.
                                 £yD.B.. Scott, F.B.S.

     Specimens discovered by Messrs. Wild and Lomax ia the Gauister beds of the
Lower Coal-measures of Lancashire prove that the seed-like bodies described by
 Williamson under the name of Cardiocarpon ano^nalum were borne on strobili,

agreeing completely in morphology and anatomy with Lepidostrohus.
     Each megasporangium, which, as usual in Lepidodendreae, was seated on the

upper surface of the sporophyll, became enclosed, when mature, in an integument
springing from the tissue of the sporophyll-pedicel. The integument closedln over

the top of the sporangium, leaving only a narrow crevice or micropyle, which
differed in its elongated, slit-like form from the more or less tubular micropyle of
an ordinary seed.

      Within the megasporangium four megaspores were produced, one of which
occupied almost the whole of the sporangial cavity, while the other three remained
small, and were evidently abortive.

     The integumented megasporangium, containing the single function almegaspore
or embryo-sac, became detached, together witli the remains of its sporophyll, from
the cone. It appears to have been indehiscent, and presents close analogies with a

true seed.

      In a specimen from Burntisland, practically identical with the Coal-measure
form, tliough presumably of a different species, the prothallus was found fairly
preserved. It formed a large-celled tissue, occupying the interior of the functional
megaspore.

     In a male strobilus. probably of the same species as the Coal-measure specimens
above described, the microsporangia were found to be provided with integuments,
resembling those of the megasporangia but more widely open.

     It is proposed to give the generic name Lepidocarpon to the Lepidostroboid
fructification now described.' Though its seed-like reproductive bodies were
referred to Cardiocarpon by Williamson, they have no affinity with the Cordaitean
seeds constituting the genus Cardiocarpon of Brongniart, to which the true

C. a7iomalum of Carruthers belongs.

4. The Primary Structure of certain Palceozoic Stems referred to

             Araucarioxylon. By D. H. Scott, F.E.S.

     The chief object of the present communication is to exhibit some illustrations

of facts already briefly recorded elsewhere.^

     The genus Araiccarioxi/lon is an artificial one, founded to include fossil speci-
mens with secondary wood resembling that of a recent Araucaria. The Paleo-
zoic forms of Araiccavio.vylon have been shown to belong in most cases to the
stems of the extinct Gymnospermous order Cordaiteae, which was in some respects
intermediate between Cycadales and Coniferae.

     The Cordaitean stems hitherto investigated appear to have resembled ConiferjB
in the development of their wood, for the spiral first-formed tracheides are found
in contact with the pith, the whole of the wood, primary as well as secondary,
having thus been developed in centrifugal order.

     The specimens now illustrated are peculiar in possessing distinct strands of
primary wood in the pith. They belong to two species, bothfr .m the Lower Car-

boniferous rocks of Scotland and the North of England.

     In one, Araucario.vi/lon fasciculare, sp. nov., the pith is small, but the primary

strands of xylem are of large size, attaining their maximum diameter when about

to pass out towards a leaf. Their structure is mesarch, and they closely

resemMe the corresponding strands in Lyginodendron Otdhammmm. The secondary
wood has narrow medullary rays, and quite resembles that of an araucarian

Conifer.

     The other species is identical with the Araucarioxylon antiquum described by
Witham. Here the pith is of large size, nearly an inch in diameter in the specimen
illustrated, and is surrounded by a ring of forty or fifty small primary xylem
bundles, mesarch in structure, whicb appear to have passed out into the leaves in
pairs. In this form the secondary wood has somewhat broad medullary rays, and
is so far less Coniferous in character than that of A. fasciculare.

     The interest of the two species described consists in their affording a link, so
far as the primary structure of the wood is concerned, between certain of the

Cycadofilices and the CordaitefB.

5. On the Structure and Affinities of Dipteris conjugata, Reimo., ivith Notes
    on the Geological History of the DijJteridimK. By A. C. Seward, F.R.S.,
     and Elizabeth Dale.

     For the material used in the anatomical investigation of Dipteris conjugata the
authors are indebted to Mr. Shelford, of the Sarawak Museum, Borneo, and to
Mr. Yapp, of Caius College, Cambridge. The genus Dipteris is represented by
four recent species : D. conjugata, Reinw. [ = I'oh/podium {Dijyteris) HorsfieldH,
R. Br.], D. WaUichii, R. Br., D. Lobbiancc, Hk., and D. quinquefurcata, Baker
of these D. Wallichii occurs in tlie subtropical regions of Northern India, the

other three species being characteristic of the Malayan region. Among Mesozoic

ferns the genera Protorhipis, Dictyophyllmn, Camptopteris afford examples of extinct
tj'pes closely allied to Dijiferis, and widely spread geographically during the
Jurassic epoch.

     The authors propose to separate the recent genus and the fossil forms from the

--Polypodiacese and place them in a distinct family the Dipteridinre. The sporangial

characters of Dipteris do not conform precisely to those typical of the Polypodiacese,
and the anatomical features afford additional evidence in favour of placing Dijiteris
in a special subdivision of the Leptosporangiate ferns.

      The stem of Dipteris conjugata possesses a single annular stele in which
the protoxylem strands occupy a central (mesarch) position. The proto-
phloem elements are sharply marked off from the rest of the phloem, which
is succeeded by a pericycle 3-4 cells in width ; a distinct endodermis encloses the
 stele both internally and externally. Immediately behind each leaf the annular
 stele of the stem becomes elongated in a vertical direction, and gives ofl' an inverted
 U-shaped branch which ascends obliquely upwards into the leaf-stalk. The foliar
 gap, left after the passing off of the meristele, closes up in front of the leaf, and the
 stele resumes its normal tubular form.

      The paper deals also with the structure of the roots, leaves, and sporangia of
 Dipteris conjugata, the comparison of the anatomical features with those of tie
 Cyatheacese and other ferns, and conclude.'; with an account of the geological and
 geographical range of such fossil ferns as may reasonably be placed in the family

 Dipteridinte.
